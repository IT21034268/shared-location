2,not happy,for the price i was slightly disappointed with this product. it is a whole lot smaller than what it appears to be online and i have two kids and my kids have a hard time playing together without totally hurting themselves in there. the other complaint i have about this product is that i have had this thing for only a week and it already has a rip in it. might i add that there were no sharp or rough objects in or around this toy. it was ripped by just my daugter (who is 11yrs. old) pulling her younger brother out of it so it can be deflated. i now have to repair the rip so they can continue to play. also it was hell getting shipped over. since there was no overseas delivery we had to ship it to relatives to get it shipped to us and it was extra money and a complete mess. and let me add that the original purchase was already $400 dollars. i was happy to see my kids happy for the first few days and now i just wish i could get a refund!! i do not recommend
1,Don't Buy It,This Jump si not good...it brakes very fast i want my money back.... It looks nice with the lights but the quality sucks.....don't buy itKaleida Disco Inflatable Bounce House
4,Perfect bounce house for small groups of kids,"We bought this bounce house for my son's 6th birthday in July of 2008. He had 6 friends over, and all of them were in there at one point laughing like crazy! They jumped, rolled, bumped into each other, and had an awesome time. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and is small enough to use in our backyard over and over again. I was even able to get in there and bounce with my two sons one day and had a blast. The octagon shape makes it unique and the colors are fun - not like the typical square bounce houses. My two sons and their friends used it over and over throughout the summer and fall and it's never had a tear, and we used it on our concrete slab patio. This was well worth the money, considering it usually costs $100 or more to rent bounce houses, and you have to give them back at the end of the day. I would recommend this bounce house to anyone!"
3,"expensive, tears easy, but fun","This is very expensive and the lights crack easy, the thing gets tears around the light pockets - but - this is a great way to exhaust your children. We set it up in the garage and let the kids play until they drop!"
4,I liked it,I bought it for when I went to school and it helped me out during that time. It served its purpose.
5,Russian Punchneedle,Started punch embroidery as a whim a couple of years ago. An easy craft. This book opened my ears to a different world of punchneedle. Learning more and more as I read. I would recommend this book to all embroidery folks
3,for the price,"These sheets are ok for the price, but they have a backing on the sheets that catch on everything. They are not the good heavy fleece."
2,one-sided softness,"The Pike Street fleece sheets are great on one side, but the soft fleece is only on one side of the sheets. That's OK for the bottom fitted one, the flat sheet should have fleece on both sides! My kids were a little disappointed, as was I. [This is true for both the twin and the full.]"
3,Cheap Fuzzy Sheets,"I purchased these sheets for my son's bedroom - we handed our queen bed down to him, and his room gets chilly. While they are soft and warm, they are also poor quality and not made of natural fibers. I would not have been satisfied with them for my own bed, but my son likes them well enough (he's 3 and doesn't know any better!). Still, for the price I paid ($13) I can't really complain."
3,"OK, but there is better",This fleece sheet set is OK but is not as heavy as others that I have. I would not recommend them for colder climates; southern states would be OK. They are nice and without flaws and the color is warm.
2,Sheet set,"One of the problems with online purchases is the pictures don't always do the product justice. For the sheet set, the ""fleece"" was a foamed polyester that felt like sleeping under a sponge. The top sheet looks warm in the picture, but actually is only a little warmer than a thin cotton sheet. The sheets would be good for a kids bed, and may be good for someone on a hot night without AC since the fabric seems good at handling moisture."
3,packaging was in bad shape,"The plastic bag which contained the item was cut and torn. Because of that, the item was dirty and I had to wash it to ensure that it would come clean. This was intended to be a gift."
4,flannel sheets,"bought as gift,for my husbands aunt, looks to be a very well made set of sheets...winters coming, i'll bet she'll love them"
3,Can't beat the price!,"First off: no one pays me for my opinions, good or bad. Amazon asked me what I thought of this product, so here's what I think: I absolutely LOVE fleece sheets, but for those who have never tried them before, these are a good introduction at a great price! They are not the ultra-luxe, soft-as-a-feather fleece sheets you can get if you pay a bit more (about $34 for a queen set on Amazon), but a good start if you're not sure if you'll like fleece sheets or not. Don't get me wrong, these are soft and quite serviceable. I recommend them as a starter set, and if you like these, you'll LOVE the more expensive ones. I won't go back to flannel sheets in the winter now."
1,Worst Sheets Ever!!,These sheets lasted two nights on our bed. They pilled so bad that our entire white carpet was covered in blue fabric pills. We threw them away and had to pay to have our carpet cleaned!! What a huge waste of money!!
3,Warm economical fleece sheet,These sheets are warm and economical. They are for the budget minded since they are fleece on one side only. They are soft to the touch and you never get into a cold bed. Your body relaxes the moment it is encased between the sheets.
2,Fleece Sheet,"The product is good value at the sale price of 29.00. If it were priced at the retail price implied---$60.00---it would not be since the Company Store equivalent is much better quality. But for 29.00 for a kingsize set, its pretty good."
2,fleece sheets,"The price was right, not a good quality fleece though, doubt it will hold up through many washings"
5,I was skeptical,"Pike Street Fleece Queen Sheet Set, Burgundy.The color is vibrant. I have washed them at least 5 times and the color remains true. The sheet set is of minimal weight and I wondered how something so light could be so warm. Even at the full price this sheet set would be a good value, but at 1/2 price I would consider it to be an outstanding value. Would not hesistate to purchase the item again. Very satisfied customer, Louise"
2,A bit disappointed,"I read other reviews and expected it to be fleece on just one side. However, it was very thin as well as being minimally thick fleece on one side. The wedgewood blue color is deceptive on the picture. It is not light blue, but rather a deep azure blue. The quality is not high, but rather flimsy with a lot of static. I am keeping the sheet set to avoid return hassles, but would not buy this again or recommend it."
5,great sheets!,I love Pike Street flannel sheets. I buy them as presents for all my cold-body friends and family. The wash up well and last... the price is nice too.
3,Warm fleece sheets,We purchased these sheets because the winter has been very cold this year and the heating bill was getting very high every month so we discovered fleece sheets. These sheets are only fleece on one side so when we discovered this we turned the top sheet over and use the warm soft side on our skin. Works wonderfully. We haven't used the heater in our room since we got them. They could only be better if the fleece side was on both sides of the sheets
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!","I don't know how these sheets will hold up yet, but they are sooooo cheap looking. First of all, they're only fleece on ONE side! Second, they are so sheer you can literally see right through them! Now I know why they were so CHEAP!"
1,Thin and cheap,These sheets are thin and cheap feeling. The fleece is only on one side of the flat sheet. The material is so thin that you can see right thru it. I got what I paid for....don't buy these sheets if you are looking for something plush and cozy...you will be disappointed!
2,not the quality I was expecting,The sheets were very thin and the fleece was only on one side so it wouldn't be next to you for the top sheet.
1,Waste of money,"Its soft alright, but the material is so cheap I'm considering using it for some fun sewing projects. You get what you pay for."
2,Flimsy fleece,These sheets pill immediately and after just a few washings start to wear very thin. I doubt I'll get one season out of them.
1,This item was dirty and smelly,"i bought this sheet set for my mother, i actually bought 2 and when she got them she told me that both sets had oil stains and smelled moldy, as if they were stored in a basement for a long time....i would never buy again."
3,Good for $20,"Like others I was a little disappointed when I opened the package...the sheets seem very thin. Not sure how they will hold up, but they are very soft and comfortable to sleep on. I ordered a size full...and the sheets are way too big for my bed, I had to pin them down because the corners wouldn't stay. Little disappointed in that aspect but for $20 they are good. :)"
1,Really bad product,These sheets are so thin you can actually see through them. Within two nights they started pilling and got very linty. Will never buy another set like them - they are a waste of money.
3,Know what you want before ordering...,"I actually had this set repackaged and ready to return (because it looked like it wouldn't survive ONE washing, let along routine cleaning) but then I got caught up in post-holiday stuff and missed the 30 day return window. Turns out it did survive it's first washing and may end up being an o.k. addition to our linens. My beef was just that it was super-thin, one-sided fleece and felt like it would pull apart like a cotton ball. After I ordered this set, I found the same color in Sunbeam fleece sheets and they were EXACTLY what I wanted - super thick, two-sided fleece. Of course, that set cost twice as much but was totally worth it. Here's one thing I will say in support of this set: If you get too hot with the really heavy fleece sheets, these will be perfect for you as they are thin and light-weight."
5,"Every Night I Sleep On, Makes Me Love Them More And More...","I really think this was a good purchase, especially for the price. They are a little thin, but I have to admit it's very warm. Because I've read most of the reviews, I didn't have high expectations... so when I sleped on the first night, I was very impressed.I prchased king size but it fitted on my ""California Kig"" size mattress easily. Most king size sheets are hard to put on my mattress, but this one was so perfect.Fleece only comes on one side of sheet so I flipped it and using that side.Many colors were out of stock, I would definitely buy my second set when they become avairable."
2,Disappointing,I was very excited to find XL Twin fleece sheets but the quality of these sheets were very disappointing. Ultra thin. They don't look like any fleece sheets I've ever purchased. Better off with a nice set of flannel sheets for warmth and softness.
4,Fleeced Up,"There is no question that it honestly is getting much more expensive to honestly find a warm sheet set for the Winter season. When I've heard abour Pike Street, I was honestly very skeptical. Can it honestly deliver a high-quality fleece sheet set for my bed? The answer is absolutely yes, and also at a affordable price. I absolutely felt like I was floating on thin air. It really kept me warm while I was sleeping. Even warmer than the blanket that is suppose to cover my bed. I was definitely amazed, and that is something to say. It feels comfortable, and worth the money. You can't even find the warmest fleece bedsheets at this afforable price in even your local department store. I suggest you give Pike Street a try for your bed, and give them the comfort in your own house.Price: BComfort: B+Quality: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
2,Pike Street Flannel sheet set,Recent purchase of Pike Street flannel sheet set (burgundy color) was a bit disappointing. It's hard to find Twin XL size in flannel and I'd hoped for something a bit more substantial feeling. These are thin and not very warm.
4,Very warm and soft; good price,"We decided to try these fleece sheets after seeing something similar at Target (but they didn't have any King size). They are definitely warmer than fleece (almost too warm at times) but they are definitely soft. I was glad I had read some of the other reviews so I was prepared for the one-sided issue, otherwise I would have been really upset. That said, you cannot beat the price, even if they end up only being good for one season."
4,Great for the price!!,"We live in The cold state of Ohio, and these sheets kept us warm many cold night. I gave them 4 starts because they were a good buy, but the material is cheap!"
4,pleasantly surprised,"when I first opened the package was disappointed at how thin the sheets are and only fleece on one side. After washing them and using them, I was surprised at how nice they are. Would buy again"
4,Ivory full sheets,"Great price, service and quality. Will try to buy from Pike Street again. Thank You!!"
3,"2 stars for sheets, 4 stars for curtains, so compromise.","I actually purchased these for the color as I made curtains out of them (color is a great plum shade). They serve their purpose. Because only one side is fleece, I don't think I'd be too thrilled if I got them as sheets. Although, they aren't entirely hopeless since they ARE cheap and seem like they could be comfy if the fleece side faces the body. I was also pleased that, for once, I purchased an inexpensive product that wasn't made in China. I think they're made in Spain or something."
1,Cheaply-made product,"The sheets are paper thin, and the polyester side feels wretched. I'm sending them back. As a side note, the product description says ""Made in Spain"", but the tag says ""Made in China."" NOT designer. NOT a good value, even for $25."
1,staticky sheets,"these sheets werent very soft fleece, very staticky. but thanks to amazon i was able to return them. the backside of the sheets was not fleece, it was slick. Wouldn't recommend."
1,Awful,"I bought these, thinking that for the price I would give them a shot. I read the previous reviews and still proceeded to purchase with the hopes that I could get a few uses out of them.THESE ARE THE WORST SHEETS I HAVE EVER SEEN!! These aren't fleece either it's basically felt. I washed them, since in a previous review it said it would help soften them. That was the worst mistake because now I can't return them! Plus even on a low tumble dry setting in the dryer they basically melted! Yes, the fabric melted into one another and now I can't even use them once!!Save your money - and time - and DO NOT purchase these sheets!!"
3,Warm but crappy sewing job.,"These are a nylon material and are fleecy on one side and nylon ugly on the other. I made the bed so that the fleecy side of the material on the top sheet faces in, so I am nice and toasty. The only real gripe I have is that as I was tucking the top sheet in, the over-locked stitching ripped on the seam of the top sheet. Thankfully I can sew, so I can fix it, but what a pain! Having said that, they are freakishly warm to sleep in. They have more of a blanket texture than cotton fleece sheets and the cat will not stay off them as she has thinks I put them on the bed just for her. I guess if she is fluffing and massaging them to death then they must be better than the cotton sheets."
1,Why Would They Make These?,"I can't understand why they would ever make Polyester sheets like this! The color was so beautiful and but to touch them was as bad as fingers nails down a chalkboard!!!! Not kidding! When I did a search for ""Jersey STyle SHeets"" I wanted only Jersey material, soft sleepable sheets, and these came up and I ordered them for the color. WHen I got them I had to promptly return them."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Sheets are cheaply made; only one side of the flat sheet is soft and fluffy. I have nicer sheets I purchased at Costco. Still, they are soft."
2,No pillow cases were in the box,When it arrived it was only bed sheets no pillow covers... Santa must have taken pillow cases for emergency.. matches the color with his outfit
1,flannel sheets,the sheets i ordered where not what i expected but it wasnot worth the effort to send them back.
1,Horrible,"These sheets are aweful. Please do not get them. It says fleece but it is not like any fleece I have ever seen. It is so rough and I think it actually feels like felt, not fleece, and nooooooooooobody wants a felt sheet."
4,As I expected,"The Pike sheet set was quite inexpensive so I did not have great expectations. I usually have confidence in Amazon products. However, the jersey-type fabric is quite warm and cozy. There were two small holes at the top of the over sheet. I thought of returning the set but decided not to. I simply reversed the sheet from top of the bed to the bottom.Therefore, I was not disappointed and I quite like the coziness of the fabric. I have yet to wash the set and I will have a full evaluation after that. Other than the ratty holes in the top sheet, I am usually quite satisfied with Amazon products. The low price on this sheet set was too good to resist. My risk!!"
2,Skimpy with the elastic,The fitted sheet has elastic only on the 4 corners. It doesn't stay in place and bunches up in the middle of the mattress and has to be tucked under on the both sides and re-adjusted on a daily basis. But I love the feel of the soft fleece. Was happy to find this color. Am glad that they didn't cost more that they did.
3,Pike Street Fleece Sheets With Missing Fleece,These sheets are very cheaply made. Why would anyone make a sheet that you would have to place on your bed on the wrong side to feel the fleecy part. Common sense should tell you that. Also they are sewn poorly sewn with stitching that looks like a five year old did it. Very crooked hems.
2,ok,"these sheets were functional,but not the quality that i expected. i have purchased sheets from your site before and was very pleased. i'll need to be more diligent in choosing products next time. thank you."
3,Not Happy,"I thought these would be cotton flannel sheets. I would never have bought them if I knew they were made in China. When I ordered I thought it said Spain. Not fleece on both sides. Turn top sheet fleece side down the quilt will slide off the bed. I am normally happy with Amazon, struck out this time."
2,Not what I thought,"I was looking for flannel sheets and ordered these. I thought I was getting old fashioned cotton flannel sheets and instead found out that these are microfiber sheets. One side is soft like cotton flannel, the other is just stretchy microfiber that sticks to dry fingers. Yuck."
3,fleece sheets,"These are okay--nothing wrong--but they keep me ""too warm"" so I am using the top sheet as a bit of color over my white comforter. Picks up a ton of lint though. Washes well--no real complaints."
1,Poor Quality Pike Street Sheets!,"Product arrived quickly, but the king sheets were poor quality (i.e. very thin and see through fleece material). Returned back to Amazon."
3,Fleece sheets,Very dissatisfied with this product. It is very thin and not what I expected of better fleece procucts. It also stretches out of proportion. My money would be better elsewhere.
1,WASTE OF MONEY !!!!,"THESE SHEETS ARE SO THIN YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM, WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, DO NOT BUY THESE SHEETS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Just Wrong,"These sheets are an amazing color and they are soft enough to the touch, but be forewarned, if you are even a little picky about what you want your sheets to feel like these will disappoint you, even at their low price. Honestly, I have trouble believing that these were ever sold anywhere for what Amazon is calling the original price ($50). They are not soft, fluffy fleece like a fleece throw; they are flat polyester on one side, and soft on the other. Sleeping underneath the top sheet is not very pleasant at all, because the side that touches you is the shiny, ""polyestery"" side. You could turn it over, but then it just looks ugly, so it's really not a great solution unless you absolutely don't care what your bed will look like."
1,Disappointed,"Arrived quickly but oversized and just won't fit the bed. I though the might shrink when I washed them, but that didn't work."
3,warm and soft,the sheets were soft and like others reviewed it as only fleeced on one side so I turned the flat sheet over so the fleeced was touching me. I noticed instantly that my feet were warm. I have only washed them once so can't coment on the life of the sheets. I have since bought other sheets from another co. they were a little thicker but not much. I gave it a three because I have not had them long. I would by more if I find out they are durable bcause the price is great.
5,Very soft Sheets!,These sheets are so soft and warm. My son loves them! They are very comfortable. We turn the top sheet so the fuzzy side is down and that seems to feel better on the skin.
3,It's not what you think but it's okay,It's not made of what you think but if you know that going in they are not that bad. Very warm sheets.
3,Soft but flimsy,"These sheets are very soft and comfy, but they do not stay put. The bottom ""fitted"" sheet is always coming off the mattress and getting wrapped around my legs at night. I feel warm but constricted. Oh well- I guess I can't complain for $20."
4,FLEECE is King!,"This is my first experience with fleece bedsheets. In the wintertime when our rooms tend to be a little cooler, it is comforting to know that there is a snuggly warm bed to relax and sleep in. The fleece sheeting does the trick. It is warm and very soft to the touch in even a cold room. Only time will tell how the sheets stand up to regular use and repeated washing. So far, there has been no pilling, a common complaint about some flannel bedsheets. Satin in the summertime and fleece in winter, that's my new motto. I am more than pleased with this purchase, made at a very good price of less that $15 per queen size set."
2,Could be better,"Well reading some of the other feedback, they were right. Very thin. I bought them to make a duvet cover for my friend and for the price they are ok. You can see through the material. Very hard to sew. They washed well. Sense I used the flat sheets I now have two fitted and four pillow cases I have no idea what to do with."
2,Pike Street Fleece Twin Sheet Set,The feel of this product is awesome but the thickness of isnt.I was disappointed because its a very thin not enough weight on it.I personally wouldnt buy another set.
1,fleece bedsheets,"These sheets are of exceedingly poor quality. After I washed them, I thought the texture would improve. It didn't, and now I'm left with flimsy, itchy bedding. What a rip-off!"
4,plum sheets,"I haven't actually used these sheets since I ordered them during the summer. They feel nice and warm though. Hopefully my daughter will like them in the cold winter months. Delivery was quick. The color is not as ""plum"" as I thought it would be. The picture looks a little darker than the actual product. I think the color is a much brighter purple. It still serves my purpose and looks good though so it doesn't bother me that much."
3,Not the best quality fleece around,"Last year I purchased a set of fleece sheets by Sunbeam, and they're so soft and cozy that I hate to get out of bed in the morning! When I adopted a soldier through Soldiers' Angels I thought that he'd love to have a set of nice, warm fleece sheets as a Christmas present, especially since it gets bitterly cold in A-stan. The price for these sheets was so good that I didn't hesitate to order them.I felt the sheets when they arrived, and they're not nearly as soft and velvety as the other brand - they're ""just OK."" In any case, I had a deadline by which his gifts had to be mailed to guarantee Christmas delivery and I didn't have time to do more shopping, so I chose to send them - maybe the substantial weight will provide him some extra warmth and these are undoubtedly better than the government-supplied sheets. But whereas I had a set for myself on my shopping list, I removed them - they're not nearly as good as other fleece sheets on the market."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought these last year to have warm cozy sheets for the winter. I should have saved my money. After just one wash the fitted sheet had fuzz balls all over, were scratchy and uncomfortable. In the trash they went. I do not recommed these."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I ordered these sheets in chocolate and although the color held true to the picture, I was disappointed to find that like many of the other reviewers, the sheets were extremely thin and there was only fleece on one side. The pillowcases also ran small. While they were warm, after only 2 washes, they began to develop those little fabric balls and I threw them away."
1,"thin, cheap sheets",The only plus to these sheets is that they dry quickly in the drier. They are so thin you can see through them. I got them so that we could turn down the heat at night to save energy. NOT working. Don't waste your money on these.
4,Quality Product,"The sheets are a good quality. They are soft on one side and a type of polyester on the other side. This works great with the fitted sheet, but the top sheet will have to be turned to get the soft feel."
5,A guy who is impressed!,"The wife told me to ""just get a fleece set"", anything would do. I picked this set in Burgundy and we are impressed!!! Only one side is fleece but they are warm and comfortable. So far we have washed them twice and they seem to be holding up very well. We like our bedroom on the cold side, and this makes a perfect bed to sleep in. Very nice set. Also, our bed has the extra thick matress with pillow top---this set fits perfect. I am ordering another set today with a different color."
1,Very skimpy fleece sheets,"I returned these sheets the day I received them, they were as thin as paper, and the fleece was falling off already, I couldn't imagine sleeping on them without being covered in the loose fleece. The back side of the sheets was some kind of nylon, not fleece, and they would not have been warm enough for me during the long Vermont winters. I do not recommend these sheets at all."
3,Great color but not so great quality,The color of these is awesome! Perfect to brighten up a drab room. But not so great if you want to sleep on them. They feel more like felt than they do like flannel.
2,Okay but....,"These sheets are fairly thick and soft, but after just a few washings, they have the dreaded little ""balls"" all over them. The other thing is that they attract & trap every stray piece of anything---lint, pet hair, human hair. Washing doesn't do much to get hair or other debris off these sheets once it gets on there. I wouldn't recommend them to anybody with pets or anyone who doesn't like the discomfort of pilled bedding."
5,PURRRR-FECT!,"Seriously, warm as a kitten when I'm in bed in these. Soft, pretty, washes nicely.Home run."
1,Terrible,"These sheets are soft, but I would hardly call them ""fleece"". You can see through them, and after one wash cycle, they were already worn-through and pilling. One side is nylon, and the other is more like cheap felt. Do NOT buy these sheets if you are looking for warm, snuggly, winter sheets."
3,Acceptable quality for $7,"I bought this set here at Amazon on sale for $7 and some odd cents. It is well worth the price, however I wouldn't pay too much more. They are of decent quality and the floral print isn't as bad in person as in the pic online. They are soft, comfy and warm. I couldn't ask for more at the price I paid. I am pleased with my purchase and if they go onsale again for this low of a price I will definitely buy more. I wouldn't pay more than $15 for them though, even though that still would be a super price for a King sheet set, especially in fleece."
4,a lil thin but feels nice and warm.,"its made of fleece, a lil thinner than i thought, but it works nicely on the mattress and feels very soft and warm.i'm satisfied!"
2,Not high quality,"While the Pike Street Fleece sheets did fit the inflatable queen-size bed for which we bought them, holes appeared in the sheets after the first washing and before they were used. They were soft and warm, but probably not worth the money"
2,So-so sheets are a slight let down...,"These fleece sheets weren't exactly what I was expecting. I thought it would be a synthetic fleece similar to that found in inexpensive fleece throws or light sports jackets. This is more akin to the fleece lining inside a conventional sweatshirt. While it was quite soft when new, three weeks later it's pilling up quite a bit and has actually become rough and scratchy where our feet are.Bottom line, these sheets are alright for 20 bucks, but don't wear socks or PJ's when using them as they can't take rubbing up against other fabric."
5,Quite please,"Okay if you're Paris Hilton & you're use to 1000 count egyption cotton sheets, you don't want these.But if you're regular Joe Shmoe with only a few pennies in your pocket but you would like some extremely soft and very warm sheets, you'll love these. Its like sleeping on a cloud. & the plum color is amazing."
1,Very Poor Quality,"These sheets were to be a replacement set for my son who all ready had a set of fleece sheets. He was so excited that I found these on-line and in is favorite color.Imagine my dissapointment when these arrived and my poor little 7 year old bawled his eyes out because ""they aren't soft, they aren't thick, they are no better than regular sheets""Yes, they were so bad they caused a seven year old to cry real tears.Overall these were the worst quality sheets I have ever seen. They do not have close the the texture of fleece and are so thin you can see right through them. Save yourself the hassle, and do not purchase this product"
3,This Sheet Set Bleeds Badly,"I got the plum color of this sheet set and discovered that the color bleeds badly. It bled in the wash and bled down into the mattress pad. I would suggest getting a very light color to avoid this problem. Other than that, the set seems to be okay."
1,Don't Buy these Sheets - I thew mine away after the first Wash.,"Don't waste your money like i did.. If these sheets were free, they would cost to much."
4,Cozy and light,"I have been very pleased with the burgandy fleece sheets ordered from Amazon.com. They are very generous in size, and we have a king size bed with a very high mattress... but these sheets are easy to put on our bed. They are warm, but light, and even though they have been washed and dryed several times now, there is no sign of shrinking. Another extremely positive aspect is that they have never pilled. I took my flannel sheets to Goodwill... these are a wonderful replacement. The only reason I do not give them five stars is that we ordered another set that have a slightly more pleasing texture.... but that is really a picky comment.Pike Street Fleece King Sheet Set, Burgundy"
2,marge's pic's,I was disappointed in the quality of this product compared to the micro fleece set I purchased earlier. I am sorry that I tried to save some money.
2,When does 100% Polyester make it Fleece?,"I was very disappointed when I discovered that my ""fleece"" sheets were 100% Polyester from China. Completely dooped by Amazon and amazed that they would sell an obvious rip off. My biggest complaint against shopping online is not being able to hold the item and read the information carefully. Amazon does an excellent job of giving you so much useless information that you never understand what product you are purchasing. I am also upset that this product was made in China. I understand that they law only requires that you make note that the item is imported, but given we are in the information age, Amazon should be able to tell you exactly what you are purchasing. Another reason not to buy anyting from Amazon again."
1,too thin,"These ""fleece"" sheets are paper thin. Not worth the $. Had to go buy my kids new ones at Kohls that were 100% better."
5,Sheets are great!,I really like the sheets! We used on the single air mattress and they fit very well. When I washed the sheets the color did not fade and no shrinkage. Great item!
3,bed sheets,I was not as happy as I thought I would be with this product. There was not much fleece to it as far as I am concern. I did get the shipment quick.
1,my first review on amazon ever- worst sheets ever,I live in Texas. it is hot here. you sweat sometimes when you sleep. polyester does not absorb sweat. I will never buy polyester sheets again. even if they're only $8.
4,sleeping on a cloud,"Even though the sheets are not heavy, they are very warm and soft.I like them alot.Good value"
1,Ugly,I ordered the Floral Garden sheets. These are so ugly. On the picture they look white with bright flowers. They are a very dirty greeny grey and the flowers are faded. Not like the picture at all.
1,Poor quality,"We were living in FL while most of our Family was in CA, so I ordered online Christmas gifts to be delivered, when we got back to CA and I saw these sheets I was so embarrassed, they are so thin and not like the soft thick fleece sheets you can by at Ross or Dept stores, definitely NOT worth the money."
3,fleece on one side,"The fleece was average in texture. What I did not like was that the fleece was one sided on the flat sheet, soft on one side and hard on another. I bought a pair of fleece sheets from costco that was way better quality. Was not aware that the quality of fleece sheets varied so much."
4,awesome,I got these a few weeks ago after getting some for my granddaughters. They are the nicest sheets I have ever head. They may feel thin but don't let that fool you. They are very warm and snuggly. I like them better than the flannel sheets I have. I even talked a friend into ordering them. They are great.
3,These Are Cheap Sheets--That's Why They Are Cheap,"They cover your bed and you can sleep on them. That's what they are. I don't dislike them, but they are not the best quality. However, even though they sorta resemble polyester, they are indeed soft. If you are a student and need a set of sheets for a year or two and would rather spend your extra money on beer, then these are perfect. If you are newlyweds making your first conjugal bed, not so much. Shop accordingly."
5,Amazingly soft and warm. Great price too!,"I bought these sheets mostly for the price but was very pleased with the quality.Someone else rated it lower because the fleece is only on one side - we just turn the sheet over so that the soft side is on us.Super soft, super warm, super price."
3,Nice,"I own other fleece sheets and was disappointed to find that the Pike Street brand sheets are only fleece on one side, other than that they are great. I stopped using the high thread count sheets in favor of fleece, they always feel warm and the comforter doesn't slide off the bed anymore thanks to the ""stick"" quality of fleece."
2,not happy,"I bought my first set of fleece sheets last year and so loved them I had to have more. Searching the internet, I found these sheets at a great price. I ordered 2 sets and just loved the chestnut color. My disapointment came 2 days after I washed them and put them on my bed. They would not stay on. The elestic at the corners was very poorly done. I kept putting them back on the bed daily. They were soft and a nice thickness. So I am back on the internet looking for a better set. I think i will order only 1 set this time."
1,very cheap material,"These aren't ""fleece"". This is just cheap felt. They are warm during cold weather, but these sheets are also very prone to getting static electricity and no amount of fabric softener prevents it."
1,Thought It Was Great ................... But,"[[ASIN:B000RW7I56 Pike Street Fleece Full Sheet Set, Green] Initially I was very impressed with this product. It was wonderfully soft, no pilling and felt like sleeping on a cloud. Had washed it first before using and it held up well in washer & dryer, following instructions carefully. After about a week of sleeping on it, however, the areas where your body rests, especially feet and legs, started nubbing until it is now uncomfortable to sleep on. The outside area that doesn't get touched is still like new. I just washed them but that did not help at all. I cannot imagine I will be able to sleep on them for much longer. I'd rather go back to my cheap flannels than sleep on nubs."
1,karen,These can't even be called sheets. They are felt!!! The worst purchase ever. I didn't even take them out of the package. Just one touch and you know these aren't worth the package they came in. I have made fleece PJ's and I have fleece blankets so I know what I am talking about. What a waste of time and money. Very dissapointed.
1,DONT DO IT!,"THESE SHEETS ARE TERRIBLE! Another reviewer put it best when he said they are just felt!I have no idea how they ever classified as flannel! Although I havent tried washing them yet, I honestly cannot imagine them looking any better than the large STATICY FELT PIECES that they are.BIG BIG BIG DISSAPOINTMENT. I will most likely be returning."
2,you get what you pay for,I'm disappointed with quality and how thin the sheets are. They are also only soft on one side. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and buy them in a department store
2,If you sleep in socks...,"don't buy these sheets. I got a set of light-colored sheets and often wear dark socks to sleep in. Sock lint has become embedded in the sheets, making them appear dirty even after washing and drying. Sure, they're not actually dirty, but they look dirty. On the plus side, they were cheap and did last about 7 months before I got motivated to replace them."
1,DONT buy it,"The sheets are listed as fleece but they are paper thin and make flannel look big and fluffy. The ""backside"" is a dreadful synthetic material and feels gross !!"
1,Screams polyester!,"These are very thin and have that clingy, pure polyester, feeling. I would return if shipping weren't so expensive. They were cheap (on sale), but they are cheaply made too!"
3,a tad thin...,"Pike Street Fleece Queen Sheet Set, PlumI recently purchased this set and was disappointed by how thin the fitted sheet was. I gave it three stars though because it is incredibly soft and cozy to sleep on and it washed up well without pilling at all."
5,Heavenly sheets!,"These sheets are so soft - like getting into a cloud. I absolutely love them and highly recommend them. Bought a queen-sized set earlier, but now have a king-size bed so I got another set and there is nothing else I would use."
3,NOT turquoise!,"I read through the reviews and thought I would take a chance. The sheets are just fine and seemed to be of good quality, but they were not turquoise and didn't look anything like the picture. It was important to me that the color was at least close...I understand that colors will vary and look different in person, but how anybody could consider these sheets turquoise is beyond me. They are very blue, royal blue to be exact. I will be returning them. If you are just looking for fleece sheets and the color doesn't matter, I think these would be a good deal. If the color is important, I could not recommend these sheets, due to my own experience and since so many other buyers experienced the same problem with different colors."
2,Warm but extreme static..,"I got the plum color set in Oct 2008 for their touted warmth to beat the NYC winters.The positive observations are :1)warm2)cozyThe negative observations re :1) The static on these is freaking ""shocking"" literally2) The sheets/shams tend to become a little rough to look at.(I have no qualms about this because my comforter covers them up)"
2,Not so much...,If you are looking for a soft sheet set - this qualifies. The fleece part of the sheets are only one sided though so beware. These also produce a lot of static electricity - so be on guard to get shocked. It wasn't as warm as I expected these to be either.
3,ok price and ok product,"I purchased these for my grandmother. She stated the sheets were not even as plush as the ones from her dollar general store. I have to take her word, as I have not seen them. I would pay a little more to buy a more quality product next time."
4,IF YOU LIKE,"IF YOU LIKE THE GIRL GROUP SOUND, AND DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE SAME OLD SONGS YOU ALWAYS HEAR ON THE OLDIES RADIO STATION, THEN YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD. SOME INTERESTING SELECTIONS HERE, I NEVER HEARD ANY OF THEM BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS CD, BUT MOST OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT. A FEW OF THEM SEEM TO IMITATE THE PHIL SPECTOR ""WALL OF SOUND"" (INCLUDING THE SOUND OF CASTANETS CLICKING) , AND A COUPLE OF THE SONGS HAVE MELODIES AND VOCALS THAT YOU WOULD SWEAR WERE WRITTEN BY BRIAN WILSON (THEY WEREN'T). ADMITTEDLY, THESE SONGS AREN'T ""DEEP"" OR HAVE ANY SPECIAL MEANING, OTHER THAN SOME GIRL IS SINGING ABOUT A GUY SHE LOVES, BUT I'M NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT ANY KIND OF MUSIC THAT TAKES ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY ANYWAY. I DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE OTHER CDS IN THIS SERIES BUT I WILL CHECK THEM OUT, BASED ON THIS ONE."
5,Audiovox tops in XM market,"Audiovox receiver and components are packaged well, the instructions are clear and the product performs remarkably well.Apparently the demand exceeds the supply and many electronic stores are out of stock. I had no trouble finding what I need through Amazon."
4,Better than Rumble Doll,"Great album and much better than Play It As It Lays. Very ""free"" style and sounds like she's having a ball."
4,Another great CD from Patti!,This is a really good cd. I now have all 3 of Patti's cd's and I like each one of them.
4,Full of memories and style....,"I'll make this one short and sweet. For the most part I lovethe way she transports you musically and lyrically to anotherera full of some really excellent sounds. Shes a great storyteller as well. I can just feel Laura Nyro's soulful spirit riding through these, and of courseRonnie Spector just spills out here and there. This takes some listens toflesh out the gems, but much like her lastcollection in 93'-RUMBLE DOLL, its so musically adventurous and likeable, a very welcome return to such a talented singer. Althoughits been 11 years, her voice hasn't lost anything, its addedmuch more depth. Much like Rickie Lee Jones,and Bonnie Raitt she projects a great voice and vision toher inner city 60's-70's-80's street/soulstyle songs. We need more class in the music business like thelikes of Patti. Highly Recommended!!"
4,listen with an open mind -- and heart,"This is a beautiful album. The songs are very good, consistent but with enough variation in styles to keep it interesting. The production -- by Steve Jordan (original Letterman drummer who has played with Neil Young and Keith Richards among others -- is top-notch. Her voice reminds me most often of Rickie Lee Jones, but she's got more range and less idiosyncrasy. Bruce and Nils play on it, but it's not real E-sreetish. Marc Ribot is on it too.I know it's hard to approach this without preconceptions, but trust me this is a quality piece of work, not at all a vanity project. It's stupid that I feel like I have to defend this record. I'm really glad she doesn't let the naysayers bother her. She went all out on this one, and it shows. Give it a chance."
1,DREAAAADFUL! JUST DREADFUL!!!,"I wonder if the people who rated this cd so high actually meant to rate another artist instead. I cannot for the life of me figure out how this woman got a solo recording contract (did someone say Bruce?) She cannot carry a tune and at times you almost feel embarassed for her because she's straining so hard(and is still off key). I have heard better voices on American Idol and even doing karoeke. PLEASE, please please sample this cd before you buy!"
4,Nice surprise... again,"Not quite as good as her debut but a nice solid CD. Her voice is still just ok, but cool songs and arrangements."
4,More of Mrs.Bruce Springsteen,"Patti Scialfa,aka Mrs. Bruce Springsteen,did not have much sales success with her 1993 debut RUMBLE DOLL. Luckily,that album is still in production. Here is a combination of studio tracks and live tracks. I guess we could say that Springsteen is keeping his wife's solo career on track. She probably will never achieve as much success as Springsteen,though. Cool album!"
1,Wow...,"this album stinks. The song writing is ok, but the singing is horrible. She's got the worst sounding voice ever--even worse than Keith Richards & Macy Gray. Hearing her sing is like taking a fork to a chalk board."
2,isn't as expected,"simply put, this product is a prime example of ""you get what you pay for""BAD1.It doesn't heat up enough to be noticeable2.The sleeve were the ice pack go's, is so thick you can barely feel the cold.3. the vibration gets annoying after a wile.GOOD1.it is a comfortable shape.2.fits comfortably around neck.to sum it up:if you want a product thats going to ACTUALLY help your neck/back feel relaxed, look else ware.if you want a comfortable neck apparatus, then you may be in luck."
5,WOW! Fab book,"Boy, I couldn't believe it when I got this book. It covers everything from ground prep, foundation, framing, configuring the building to fit it's use.....on and on and on! It blocks everything out, so if you are not comfy with doing that one piece yourself, you can contract that piece out and pick up from there. I can't wait to get my hands dirty! Read the whole thing first."
3,Black does not remove minor scratches,This is a very costly good TYPICAL-TYPE wax. I applied per the directions found on web sites such as the Lexus Forum.No doubt...it's good quality...really didn't help hide those swirl marks on black paint and not any more superior than another quality wax. Perhaps trying Black Box by turtle wax would be just as good and also lessssss costly!
3,Sheets are not of high quality,No complaints with the comforter and pillow covers.. The bedsheet and fitted sheet however needs to be of a better quality for the price.The elastic snapped at two places and the sheet almost tore in half while I was trying to fit it on my bed(queen)...A fitted sheet from walmart ($7) is more resilient and has more depth than the one that comes with this set!I love the oversized comforter...Very functional and attractive.
5,Nice Album!,"I first heard the track ""I Am A Psychiatrist"" on my Sirius satellite radio, and I was immediately hooked! This track is so BOMB (good) that I wanted to buy the cd immediately. I listened to samples of the rest of the disc at my local record store with equal approval. While many fans consider Scratch an icon in reggae music, I have generally been disappointed with a lot of his works (bad production values, inane lyrics, forgettable stuff). Not so with this one. I believe that reggae music fans in general and Scratch fans in particular will find favor with this offering."
2,Nothing new for the experienced developer,"There's a lot of sensible information and guidelines in this book, but its main problem is that most of it is a bit abstract, and should be known material for experienced developers or architects.For inexperienced developers or people just starting out on the path of good software architecture, this book may provide some insights, but doesn't offer much practical advice on how to solve concrete problems.However, it is a pretty good and comprehensive survey of the state of so-called ""best practice"" of .NET architecture as it looks today, and I didn't encounter much that I couldn't agree with.As it is a blissfully short book (157 pages including appendices) compared to most books on software development, it may be worth if you need to get a quick overview of the subject. However, the tone is rather dry and condensed, so don't expect those 157 pages to be a light read."
1,Oxymoronic,"The notion of application architecture applied to a ""framework"" like .NET is somewhat oxymoronic. This book is credited not to individuals but to Microsoft itself, and such books tend to be more marketing-oriented pitches about how cool Microsoft's software is than serious documents containing deatiled technical information. It has all the right buzzwords like ""patterns"" and ""distributed solutions,"" but there's little of substance here that couldn't be gleaned elsewhere in a less pedantic package."
3,Another heaven,"Another HeavenThis is the kind of movie where you should leave your brains alone when watching, since there is one heck of a credibility leap. It tries to be too many things at the same time, a crossover between murder mystery/suspsense/scifi/horror. Eiguchi Yosuke fans probably won't be disappointed. Also...do not watch on a full stomach unless you have one made of iron."
4,Almost perfect!,"I was drawn into the story from the opening scene--one of the greatest, sickest openings in film history! The storyline is highly dirivitive (think The Hidden, Jason Goes to Hell, Shocker, and on and on), but the acting and direction are so good, you are willing to go along for the ride. One of the best thrillers (Asian or otherwise) I have seen in some time."
1,Very dull movie,"I bought this movie on ebay; watched it; found it very boring, and it's in the trash--literally. I thought Fangoria lowered their standards not a little, but a great deal. There was very little gore in it, in fact. Not much of a plot, either. A few times I was nodding off and had to struggle to stay awake. In fact, I found the movie so boring I had to turn it off a few times and resume it later. It was simply impossible--due to how boring it was--to watch all at once.I honestly believe high school students can make a movie better than this.Some Japanese horror was very good, but lately there is a horrific stream of extremely boring ones. This is another one of them.It's good to watch if you can't fall asleep at night. It will bore you to sleep in no time."
3,Not bad but...,"I think the movie was good but there were many aspects that the director whould have improved. I do think that the Japanese horror films are one of the best ones, but sometimes they tend to be too ""occidentals"" and they screw it up... Something that made me laugh a lot, was that the cops were extremely wiolent, corrupts etc... hahaha! They were even worse than Denzel Washington in Trainning Day! And I even laughed more when a guy shot the police with the Inspector-Gadget-coat-style at least 4 or 5 times and the guy was not dying!!!! Anyway, the movie could have been excellent but... these little things, believe or not, can really make think a viewer that the movie was a comedy, not a horror film."
5,A great addition to an already large Tolkien library,"When I bought this book a few years ago, I thought it was an excellent resource for clarifying some points not covered in The Silmarillion. Tolkien was truly gifted ."
1,Plowing through the mud of the Middle Earth,"I am absolutely certain that this is the greatest fantasy epic poem ever written in the English language. I have enjoyed Tolkien books for years. I have attempted to finish this one for years. I cannot get through it. It is an epic poem, and like most straight men, I simply cannot get excited about the epic poetry literary form. There are great stories of the Middle Earth embedded in this thing, probably as good as if not better than ""Lord of the Rings"", but it's like a gold coin in the middle of a snake infested swamp - highly valuable, but not worth the effort to recover. Those among us who love poetry will love this book. The rest of us will find something else to read."
5,The Poems of Middle-Earth,"The Lays of Beleriand is basically a book of poems that J.R.R. Tokien wrote about the tales of the Silmarillion. Poems such as that of Turin Turambar, as well as a few other noteworthy works. It's probably best to have some background on the Silmarillon before reading this."
5,I am proud of my father!,"Yes, this is Mr. Robinson's son. I was there from when it first went down on paper to the point where it is now. It took alot of sacrifice and hard work to bring to his readers the type of book that was not some stupid, plotless sex novel that they usually find. I am also proud to say this is only the begining for Tammi and Steve. Yes there are more tales of true passion and what it means to love someone so much that you are willing to do whatever it takes to keep them in your life, even if that means sacrificing and bending your own will to make them happy. Yes I have read it myself and as for being in a relationship of my own it has help ME to understand the meaning of true passionate love. (...)"
4,Brain Food,"Helps you remember things and has worked for me. Only rated it 4 stars on the basis of, i don't know how long this effect will last."
4,As Expected,"One thing to note is that these pills taste awful, swallow quick.Other than that, fine, just as I expected."
3,what did i buy!,"through out history man has wondered: how do i make my self smarter and more mentally capable! and Bacopa was discovered by the Swedish Scientists i assume. then Bacopa was extracted for the plant with great difficulty i would assume and squished into a pill form for easy ingestion.amazing product, after ingestion it travels to the stomach where our body receives the Bacopa with slight confusion at first wondering is a pill going to make the brain smarter. then its just a matter of swallowing this on a daily basis.Mechanism of action: in the stomach enzymes called hectanaze bind to the Bacopa polar end and pull activating the Bacopa in the body, after that Bacopa is activated and it is absorbed into the liver then to the brain via the liver brain artery. in the brain it simply adds more Gigabytes to our memory just like a flash drive does to a computer. this is my 16 bottle and ive memorized alot of info from some books."
2,for wives who have lost a husband.,i bought this for my dad after my mom died.i was dissapointed. it should be titled 'when a man dies' with advice like 'wake up each morning and put on some lipstick' it is clearly written with a woman reader in mind.
1,Grief Expressed When A Mate Dies.,"I was a funeral director for over 34 years before retiring. I also lost my wife in September of 2012 and I read this book on a recommendation from a female friend. The book is written by a female who lost her husband and thinks she is qualified to write a book on grief. The book is written only from the view point of a woman losing her husband, but it never addresses a husband losing a wife. I did not like the book and there are so many more qualified individuals who have written about grief that way surpass this writer. SORRY, SHE JUST DID NOT DO IT FOR ME."
1,Terrible service,"Might be a good saw, don't know. It arrived here with broken trunnion and bent handles and metal, three weeks ago and I am still waiting for them to pick it up to return it so I can get a refund. Not happy."
3,RIN TIN TIN COLLECTION,"The only one that I watched so far is ""The Return of Rin Tin Tin"". The story line was good unfortunately the music was terrible. It was too worn out. As if it was straining to be heard. I hope that the rest of the collection is better."
4,Awesome!,"From the opening shots of a woman beating a man with a high heeled pump, you know this is going to be fun...Costance Towers plays a prostitute who, in an attempt to reform herself and settle down, moves to perfect, small-town suburbia. Of course, after living there for a bit, she realizes what everyone who lives in suburbia already knows: It is no less corrupt and nasty than the streets. I don't have this version of the DVD, but the Criterion Collection edition is superb."
2,Upscaled old transfer to be anamorphic!,"This new VCI anamorphic edition of THE NAKED KISS does feature some new to DVD bonus interviews, BUT the transfer is not good at all! It looks to have been unscaled from a flat widescreen master, and there is major ringing and compression artifacting around words anytime they are on the screen. This transfer is worse than Criterion's, which also needs to be redone. So far the best I've seen this film look is on the UK R2 PAL DVD release, which is unmatted but is properly cropped on a widescreen TV once the full/fill mode is used. It is sharper, brighter and smoother than any US release I've seen.DON'T BUY THIS DVD IF YOU ARE WANTING A HIGH QUALITY NEW ANAMORPHIC TRANSFER!"
3,"""Taboo"" subject matter-Sam Fuller sneaked this in!","First of all; the word ""taboo"" was a headline grabber in the day...this movie was as close to this as possible back then. But it's not worth $27 and I am not sure it is Criterion-grade in subject, production or talent. Subject and talent are usually in the eye of the beholder, but the digital transfer is sub-1 star. A good $9.99 DVD."
1,Not in the film's original format.,"This is an excellent Film Noir.But 1.33:1 is this film's original format. To make it fit the now ever popular wide screen TVs, Criterion has cut off part of the top and bottom to make it 1.75:1. With parts of the top and bottom missing, the very carefully planned and executed composition is now destroyed.I'm extremely upset with Criterion. I'm a film purest - preferring to always view a film as it was originally designed and intended - not butchered just to make it fit my widescreen TV.However, the transfer is really cleaned up as you have come to expect from Criterion."
3,Mecca Lecca Huh??!!,"A Gratin of spastic awkward forced contoversy fisting its way stiffly through its 1950's girdle, Naked Kiss seeks to be a controversial film yet doesn't feel remotely real in any way. Comically sad and stiffly acted, it is the epitome of a 1950's ""B"" movie (although a ""B"" may be somewhat kind) it is the vegas lounge singer of movies not purposefully campy or kitsch, it truly tries to get off the ground but has no wings... or legs for that matter yet it nobly pushes forth its best effort and THAT is the stuff of which genres are born.In many ways, this film is kind of what the transition between the '50's & '60's were about. An awkward attempt to grow up too fast without knowing how. We get to watch the spasmotic growing pains of the ""Me generation"" pushing farther & faster than they can handle.Come for the cheese, stay for the quirkyness."
2,"The buck, the bed, and the bottle","Two-thirds of the way through THE NAKED KISS a wardful of pediatric orthopedic patients, wearing pirate hats and leaning on crutches, perform a musical number with the formerly bald ex-prostitute who's now engaged to the richest man in Grantville, after telling him that upon her arrival in town she shared her favors and a bottle of Angel Foam with the town's un-uniformed cop, Griff, who'd she met immediately upon debussing....Sorry. I'm confusing you. At least I didn't mention the Bon-Bon Girls in the town across the river or the room Kelly rented from the woman with the dressmaker's bust commemorating her departed intended George or...Right. Anyway, after the musical number things really start to get weird. Cross PEYTON PLACE with a bad-acid trip and you get the idea. Probably good campy fun if you're in the mood."
3,an interesting and unusual film,This review is for the Criterion Collection editionIn this film a former prostitute who moves to a small town to try and get on with her life. She takes a job as a nurse in a children's hospital. She makes several friends in the town and later finds herself in trouble.This movie has a very interesting plot and touching end but I don't want to give any spoilersCriterion only added a theatrical trailer for special features making it kind of dull. The accompanying paper still has the standard essay on the film though.
3,Half the instructions are incomplete re: supplies,"I've never written a review before, but after spending over an hour trying to decipher the sizes (and even the types in 2 cases) of beads in one of the particularly pretty designs, I have finally thrown up my hands. And I am an experienced jewelry maker! It's so odd how some of the beads are named properly and given the appropriate sizes while others are not. How is anyone supposed to work with that? I'm also not all that impressed with most of the designs in this book -- unfortunately there was just this one and one other that I already knew how to do..."
3,Less than Expected,The quality of the material and printing was less than I expected for a pricey booklet. The information is basic and does not really provide a clear and concise spectrum of the Cost Management process
3,Promising First Novel,"Day Stripper is a readable, entertaining first novel for Scholten. The mystery follows Aubrey Lyle, a San Francisco stripper who finds herself tracking down a murderer after another of Naughtyland's dancers is found strangled in a leather bra barrowed from Aubrey.Aubrey is helped along by an assortment of strange yet endearing roommates and friends who add texture and redeeming humor to the story. Though at times defensive of her work Aubrey is painfully realistic and practical about it. In fact Aubrey's roommates have begun to worry that her job as a ""testosterone mop"" has robbed her of her sex drive.Scholten (who worked her way through graduate school as a stripper) depicts the illusionary world of ""Live Nude Girls"" as often grim and sometimes bizarrely amusing but never erotic particularly for the women working in it. Although at times uneven Day Stripper is a promising first novel for Scholten. It will be interesting to see what future stories she pens."
3,"The Original ""Lone Ranger"" Film","Considered by film historians to be one of Republic's finest chapterplays, ""The Lone Ranger"" (1938) also remains one of the great ""lost"" serials. Sadly, the original negative no longer exists and the only surviving prints feature Spanish subtitles and substandard quality. Republic's 1940 abridgment, ""Hi-Yo Silver,"" remains the best opportunity to see this classic serial. Running 68 minutes, it moves at a swift pace with plenty of terrific stuntwork and six-gun action. However, Republic has altered the traditional Lone Ranger framework by presenting FIVE masked men - a device later used in 1943's ""The Masked Marvel."" It's an intriguing concept, though fans of the radio and television series may be disappointed. The print quality of ""Hi-Yo Silver"" is quite good, which makes one hope that the original serial will surface in the same condition."
3,OK but it's not the original,This is a movie made from a serial. It has a odd flow because of this. I wish a good quality version of the serial was available.
3,Fantastic Insight!,"Nataline has great insight when it comes to how our life force energy is affected by what we eat and how we combined our food. She talks about how we need to eat foods that digest quickly and exit the body quickly other wise our bodies spend all day working to digest food and we use up all our energy that could be put to better use. As for her 21 day plan and her recipes I agree with parts of it but not all of it. I ate very similar to her plan for a very long time and yes, I maintained a perfect weight for my height and body shape but I did not feel as good as I would have like physically. I personally did not feel my best until I adopted a low fat raw vegan diet.This book is a great book don't get me wrong, and a great book to transition from the SAD diet to a healthier diet and maybe onto eating a low fat raw vegan diet which we were biologically designed."
2,More Juice Detox type of book than raw food recipe book,"There are about 2 recipes I've used repeatedly after having this book for years now, but that's it. Much of the book is preaching on how we need to detox and juice. This book is more on an extreme level. For day to day raw food I'd search elsewhere."
3,The Raw Food Detox is Better,"I have to agree with other reviewers that her first book is much better because it lays out concepts clearly and with simple recipes. This book introduces the concept of energy vibrations and talks about other health issues relevant to this way of eating. If you want the basics go with the first book, but if you are looking for more thoughtful insight this one would be good."
4,great book,"I love the Detox for women better only it's more specific to what I have (Candidiasis), but this book is great as well.It's not much different from Detox for women though."
4,It's Got Everything... Except....,"Good book, explanations, recipes...... BUT ----> I want/NEED to know the amount of PROTEIN, FAT, and CARBS per serving that I am eating at every meal; and don't have time to look it up and calculate the values myself. Recipes with nutritional values would be so much more helpful, I am am athlete and need to keep track of this kind of information. Next update, pleeeeeease add this information? Can anyone recommend books with good recipes that DO have this information? Thanks."
1,I don't like it at all!!!,"I've had great expectations for this book, but it was a delusion instead. The good part is the flexibility on the percentage of raw eating, but the combination part of the book is absurd, it doesn't work in my experience, it's unhealthy and dangerous for diabetics and people with X syndrome."
3,"Good book, nice recipes, and somewhat educational","I love Natalia Rose. I think she is a bit extreme, and I do not agree with all of her recommendations and the strict theories of food combinations but I must admit that when do you follow her regimen, you feel and look incredible. The recipes are very good, especially her ginger honey salad dressing. I do recommend it if you are starting or exploring a raw diet."
5,great,"a great next step to the Raw Food Detox by Natalia. The first one is wonderful for getting started, this is great for moving along into higher ground."
5,Milli\e fiori watch,This is a replacement watch. It is exactly what I wanted- except the battery was dead- I had it replaced for $14.
2,Disappointed.,"While I find the premise of this book very interesting, I found Jones' writing to be repetitive and at points excessively paranoid. When I started to detect undercurrents of anti-semitism, I stopped reading, and did a little checking into this author. I found that some of his other writings contain more than undercurrents of anti-semitism. I became very uncomfortable with the idea of having any of his work in my personal library, and I returned the book without finishing it. While I'm sure he presents some very interesting information about the history and consequences of the sexual revolution, I'd like to find a book that does so in a more level-headed (and better edited) manner.For those interested in this subject, a better alternative would be Wiker and DeMarco'sArchitects Of The Culture Of Death."
3,Son of the Pink Panther,"Funny in parts, but not up to the level of when Peter Sellers was playing Clouseau. Hebert Lom and Bert Kwok are the only actors that hold the movie together. The usual clumsiness was abit overdone."
2,"Good movie, don't buy it.....","Okay, so I may be one of the few that enjoyed this movie. I did not have high expectations and knew it would be silly. It did make me laugh. So, I was so happy when Isaw that this was available on DVD. In this day and age of technology, it is completely unacceptable to produce a DVD with such poor sound quality. I don't know why it is, but I constantly had to raise and lower the volume. I have not had this problem with any other DVD, so this was a real disappointment for me. I bought this DVD for under $10 and I still say it isn't worth $5! The sound is horrible. If you have not seen this film and you are a fan of the actor or the series, then rent it, and you won't feel like a sucker."
1,Disgust from a Benigni lover,"I am a great fan of Roberto Benigni, and own most of his films, including, unfortunately, this one. The plot could only be described as ponderous at best, the sight gags were mediocre, and the actors, who were obviously trying hard to bring this out of the muck, could not do the impossible. Benigni is only at his best when he writes and directs and when he can perform in his native Italian."
3,Not Very Good!,"This is not the best Pink Panther film that I've seen. I've seen The Pink Panther, A Shot In The Dark, Inspector Clouseau, The Return Of The Pink Panther, The Pink Panther Strikes Again, Revenge Of The Pink Panther, Trail of The Pink Panther, Curse Of The Pink Panther, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. This is my 9th favorite Pink Panther Film. It is not as good as The Pink Panther Strikes Again. It has a great cast. Roberto Benigni as Gendarme Jacques Gambrelli, Herbert Lom as Police Commisioner Charles Dreyfus, Claudia Cardinale as Maria Gambrelli, Shabana Azmi as the Queen, Debrah Farentino as Princess Yasmin, Robert Davi as Hans Zarba, Burt Kwouk as Cato Fong, Graham Stark as Professor Auguste Balls, Oliver Cotton as King Haroak, and Dermot Crowley as Francois Duval. That was my review.Jedi404"
1,ill-legitimate attempt at continuing the Panther dynasty,"Oh dear. The ""ill-legitimate"" son of Panther. Positively ill-making, desperately forced attempts at humor. A confused plot. Broad pratfalls and grimacing. If you liked the silly subtlety of Peter Sellars, you will be horrified by this ill-advised attempt at cashing in on his legacy. If you want a good giggle to lighten your day or evening, try ""The Imposters"", instead."
2,The worst performance of anyone involved.,"Do you want to watch a bad movie? Here it is! Despite of the title, the director and the casting, the result is poor. The exception is Roberto Benigni, of course, whose effort gives the small amount of comic wit you can enjoy in watching the movie; this is why we rated the second star. Apart from his comic scenes, the movie lacks continuity of action and even misses to end some minor plots, making you wonder if it will ever have a sequel, or if the director himself pitifully stopped the movie, just to avoid more boredom to the audience. If you like Peter Sellers, don't watch this movie: you will miss him. If you like Roberto Benigni, use your scissors and keep just his best performances."
3,Roberto Bengni as the Inspector's son.,"It has been ten years since the last ""Pink Panther"" film in 1983. And the last one with Peter Sellers using unused footage,Trail of the Pink Panther, was released in 1982. Peter Sellers died in 1980.This time they try Roberto Benigni (years before his Academy Award win) who plays the son of Inspector Clouseau. Since Benigni is a French comedic actor, the film is probably more popular in Europe.This is the last ""Pink Panther"" film for Herbert Lom, Burt Kwouk and Liz Smith. Burt Kwouk is given alot more scenes to do this time around.Claudia Cardinale returns in her original role from the very first film,The Pink Panther (Collector's Edition)(1964).Revival:The Pink Panther(2006), starring Steve Martin.Pink Panther 2(2009), Steve Martin returning, but with John Cleese as ""Dreyfuss""."
3,The kung fu guy,"Ok, it been a while since I saw it, but no matter how much the rest of the movie is terrible, that guy who's job is to keep Clouseau on his toes is the most ingenious character ever invented. If the movie had just been those two constantly fighting it would have won greatest movie of the millenium."
3,Roberto Benigni Saves the Day,"The Son of Pink Panther was humorous enough in its initial release to deserve at least matinee prices. Is it ""Return of the Pink Panther""? No, nothing so stylish as that. Does it have a solid plot? No, nothing for would-be screenwriter to pour over, here. But as an example of physical comedy, there are many gems to be found, and surely any fan of the newly-famous Roberto Benigni will want to see this Italian's early foray into the international film market. (Oh, and Leonard Maltin is quite correct: the title sequence with McFerrin's redo of the Pink Panther theme is certainly enough on its own to justify renting the film, if not owning it outright.)"
2,Ouch! Not a Peter Sellers that's for sure!,"Well... I watched the whole thing. A poor imitation of the Peter Seller's Pink Panther series of movies. The supporting characters were good, but the main character (Son of Inspector Cloussou) was nothing but horribly mis-cast. Has a few good moments."
2,A bad movie.,"Do you want to watch a bad movie? Here it is! Despite of the title, the director and the casting, the result is poor. The exception is Roberto Benigni, of course, whose effort gives the small amount of comic wit you can enjoy in watching the movie; this is why I rated the second star. Apart from his comic scenes, the movie lacks continuity of action and even misses to end some side plots, making you wonder if it will ever have a sequel, or if the director himself pitifully stopped the movie, just to avoid to bore the audience. If you like Peter Sellers, don't watch this movie: you will miss him. If you like Roberto Benigni, use your scissors and keep just his best performances."
4,Good battery,"Battery is working well, so far everything is good. Have good battery life etc..One knock on it is the battery is too big."
3,Phantom Album,"This record was never released under this title, as two labels were set to release live Derringer at the same time and Archive blinked. The show in question wound up being released on the Phoenix Gems label as LIVE AT THE PARADISE THEATRE. (Note that the three star rating applies towards the Phoenix Gems version - hard to rate the Archive version when it doesn't exist!)"
2,Incomplete Episode,"In the set I bought, the episode ""Monster from Another Planet"" on Season 2, Disc 2, is incomplete. When Tennessee & Chumley decide to see Mr. Whoopee, the screen goes black for a commercial break and the episode just ends without showing the conclusion. The timer on my DVD Player has the episode listed as being over 5 minutes instead of over 9 minutes like the other cartoons. Does anyone else have this problem, or do I just have a defective set?"
5,Great Collection,"I loved this series and these collections. Not only do you get Tennesee Tuxedo, but also get all the spinoffcartoons such as Klondike Kat, The King & Odie (King Leonardo of Bongo Congo), etc. The Hunter , Tooter Turtle& more.The are many good documentary special features and it has many hours of great cartoon footage!Some of the older episodes are poor in quality, but not unwatchable."
4,Love Maxwell Smart,Should have retained all the original promos and musical introductions to each cartoon episode. Video is OK. If you are a true collector and nostalgic get it.
3,Stop Complaining,"We have waited so long for a collection like this why are some people complaining? Yes, there are missing titles. Yes, the opening credits do not have the original music. Yes, they used heavy handed DVNR, but it's all there, every cartoon and many extras. It's better quality than faded 16mm prints!"
5,An Artist At Work,"Andy Partridge is most impressive, as this series will attest. Even his out takes are better than most artists' best work."
5,Finally an alien queen for the fan's eye,"I was pleasently surprised with what mcfarlen toys has done with the alien's line and one item stands out most to me, the Alien queen boxed set. First of all the size and detail are outstanding with this figure; in my opinion definatly a worthy rendition of everyone's favorite bug. The figure is doubly articulated and the face actually swivles from side to side,very true to the original creature design. It also sports a wonderfully detailed base complete with broken gratings, hapless victim and slimy alien cacoons. The only complaints I may have had with the figure is the lack of eggs with everybody's favorite parisites. Otherwise a wonderful addition to any one's table or desk top and a must for any who have ever wanted an aliens figure true to the movies."
1,Painting is not as good as advertised!!!!,"The paint job on this Queen Alien is NOT, I repeat, NOT as detailed as it appears in the pictures above. It honestly looks as if it was dipped into a vat of ugly gray house paint (with a little bit of black mixed in). Please view this product in person before decide if you want to buy it.My recommendation instead of this product: The predator vs. alien set, or the large Matrix box set. Both of these look much better than the Alien Queen."
5,great toy for any alien lover.,"unfortunatly, i could not purchase it of amazon for some reason. but in the end i got it and she is great! very detailed and true to the movie queen, i reccomend this highly!"
5,best alien toy ever!,This is the best alien toy ever! This toy is wroth the money you pay! This toy is also hard to find so if you like the alien queen and you find it at toysrus get it its (...) great price!(...)
1,Underwhelming product,"When I first purchased this product, I thought that it would be really good. I liked the layout and the features. Having one outlet bank on a surge protector and one bank on backup battery was just what I wanted.The sad part was that the battery didn't last very long, even though it wasn't put to the test very much. When I needed it most, the battery wasn't working and I didn't get any warning. So in the long run, it didn't do the job that I wanted it for. I can't recommend it at all."
5,This toaster is Fabulous!!,"I love the look of this toaster - it's fab! It fits perfectly with my modern/edgy decor. Not to mention, it works like a charm...toasts to perfection!Don't be sad, crate and barrel is now carrying this same model! www.cb2.comEnjoy!"
3,How Could They Leave out PATTY DUKE?,"If one were doing a SHINDIG compilation featuring themost popular Gal singers of the mid 60's I don't understand how they could omit PATTY DUKE. She did two appearances on the short-lived albeit very popular SHINDIG TV program and introduced two Hit records, ""Don't Just Stand There"" and ""Say Something Funny"". She was, without a doubt, the most Popular young female Teen Star of that time. Perhaps she couldn't warble to the same vocal level of Pet Clark or Aretha Franklin, but herabsence here is clearly an oversight.If this show is ever repackaged in DVD format, one would hope that Patty Duke's two appearances on this showwould not be over-looked."
1,A truly stupid cd,"This cd has ""old man"" written all over it, if your a stuffy old man who like the msuic of mitch miller, Liberace, and Andy Williams you'll love this corny awful cd"
3,"a book of paper ""constellations"" but good","this book's character is new,the technology and material in it is new."
4,INOi 20GB Photo HardDisk USB 2.0 External Hard Drive ( HD182-20 ),"Very highly reliable digital picture storage device. Get this one, it will become an element of your camera set."
1,Zero Tech Suppot,"I bought this item 5 months ago. I followed the instructions on the included ""Quick Start"" card regarding the battery, which was to top it off every week if not using it. The battery now lasts 4 minutes. When I went to write INOi the FIRST time, I opened the pdf version of that card that was on the disk to include the erroneous instructions. Guess what, they are not on that version. I've written to INOi twice and they have not answered, I can't find a battery for it anywhere. I now have a $150 piece of junk - other firms market this type of device - look elsewhere."
2,Great Idea - Lousy execution,Great size and price and well packaged but simply doesn't work. The support is non existent and the FAQ and downloads on the site don't address the issues I have or the other reviewer mentions regarding consistent back up performance.It works fine with sony cards (you'll need to by an adaptor tho') but you have to put tape over the card and use an adaptor but I use CF cards and it simply fails (every time!) to complete the copy process. As a back up you need to know that you have captured the files and it simply doesn't have that ability. Connect to the MAC and ...nothing! Myabe it likes PC's better but frankly I have had enough and am sending it back.Spend more and get a product that works.
5,"excellent, excellent, movie, really worth watching, thanks","excellent really great movie , from 1972, alan alda, and roy jenson, are really brillant brillant actors"
3,Not medium,While the band is a good product the resistance is much more than medium which is what I wanted. My physical therapist told me not to use it and I had to order the light resistance one which is perfect. Great product for those who are allergic to latex.
2,This level (1) was too stretchy for me,"These latex-free resistive bands are good for those of us allergic to latex. But I didn't know which level of stretchiness would be right for me, so I started with level 1. The bands were tough and stood up well to use, even when closed into a door hinge for leg exercises. But in a couple of weeks I realized that level 1 was too easy to stretch and did not give me enough resistance, so I ordered level 3, which suits me very well."
3,Stron,The orange band was stronger than the one that came with my EA Fitness workout. I had thought all orange bands would be universally the same strength.
2,BROKE THE FIRST DAY,"I bought this set for my son on his birthday and it broke that very day he opened it! NOT a true diecast. Only diecast on this model was the orange cab. All silver decals, bottom of semi, trailer, and hoe was cheap plastic. I cant beleive I paid this much for such a delicate toy.Regards,Amazon shopper"
2,I didn't at all like it . . .,"I didn't at all like this CD-set . . . I mean SOME of the songs were OK, but most all of them were blaa. Actually I shouldn't even say SOME - I only like 2! After I heard Keep The Candle Burning and Day By Day on WOWs, I thought they're music was wonderful. But what I didn't think was that those were the BEST songs of their's, and they're still not the greatest! So I went and bought this, and then hated it! I ended up selling it. So out of 24 best of songs, I only like 2. I can't imagine what regular CDs are like since they're NOT ""best of"" ones! I couldn't recommend this or any Point of Grace CD. The more I heard more of their music - I realized that out of ALL of it, they only have 2 good songs. OK, their new song ""I Choose You"" is pretty good, but that's it. So I couldn't tell you to get this one, but I could tell you to check out Rebecca St. James. She's, I think, the best female singer out there - Wait For Me (a best of) is her best CD!"
5,Very Good,I borrowed a copy of this CD from a gal at church and fell in love with the music and just had to have it.
5,BBC - Get this entire series to region 1 PLEASE,"This series is one of the funniest BBC Britcoms, but has not been released on bonifide region one discs.Beware of bogus region 1 discs of this series (and others) on eBay.Eight of them I have purchased won't play properly on my Panasonic region 1 players.If you have a region free player, grab them. If you have a Mac, you can use iDVD to play them,but remember you can only switch regions 5 times according to the window that opens when you load a non-region 1 DVD.All of these programs are hilarious.The Richard Wilson, Annette Crosby team is a superb Britcom treasure."
4,Curmudgeons Unite!!,Wonderfully written and acted British comedy that hasn't gotten the attention here in America that it deserves.We'll continue to add to our collection of One Foot in the Grave.
5,BUY IT!,"Very thorough and complete both in job ideas and descriptions! Gives the in's and out's of many top notch organizations with international divisions and many smaller companies/organizations not as well known of. Good book for those trying to work their way around the world, or just to get some international experience by taking their current skills abroad!"
5,Brilliant return of King Britt and Sylk 130,"""A concept album situated in a mid-eighties radio station. Musically it reworks a gamut of styles-from Daisy Age hip hop to emotive, soulful house"" says The Face. ""Made the hair on the back of my neck stand up...The King is back!"" says Mixer. ""Britt transcends boundaries and time periods...King Britt's sphere of musical influences seems boundless"" says MixMag. My personal opinion is, if nothing else, totally in agreement with those great publications."
3,Interesting But Lacking,"When I first bought the book, I thought it would be more of an analysis on how war, politics, and society fits in China. Sadly, the only part that really goes into detail about this is the introduction. The rest of the book provides vague and simple summaries of major military and political events between 900 and 1795. While interesting, these summaries are elementary at best. Lorge does not go into detail about any of these battles and campaigns but merely gives an overview, ""The Song did this in the year ___ and the Mongols responded in the year ___."" This book is only 200 pages and its content does NOT justify the hefty price. If you are looking for an introduction and overview to Chinese military history, then this book might be for you. If you seek a deeper analysis, then you should move on."
4,Dr. Payne Gives Great Advice and Problem Solving,This is truly an astonishing book that tells quite candidly how to work with and have relationships with people of different classes. I LOVED the class mindset quiz in the first part of the book. It made me think how the hidden rules of class do hinder relationships in both the business world and our personal relationships.
4,Elvis Triumphant,"The officially released ""New Year's Eve"" serves as a valuable document of Elvis Presley's last stellar performance. Though the two-CD set contains an audience recording from Presley's 1976 Pittsburgh concert, the sound quality is better than most amateur tapings. Highlighted by dynamic renditions of ""Tryin' to Get to You,"" ""Polk Salad Annie,"" ""Hurt"" and ""Unchained Melody,"" the King is nothing short of astonishing. Sadly, this level of energy and commitment was largely absent in Presley's final shows. However, for one glorious winter night in 1976, Elvis surpassed all expectations with this 90-minute tour de force."
3,3 Stars....only ???,This could have been a great cd but the sound quality is just so bad that I listened to it just one time and threw it in the bottom of my drawer.Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointed.. :(,"I also gotton this,Was very disappointed in deed.You could'nt hear Elvis very well,But you can very well hear the yelling and screaming of the fans.."
4,Bound to create controversy.,"I found Monte's book to be very inspiring. Far from the""old skool"" cliche of ""children are to be seen and not heard"". I loved the fact that he included the children in on major desicions that involved them.I believe the book and concepts to be scriptual and conveying the true essence of 'greater love has no man than to lay down his life for a friend"". I could be debated that his ideas are to simple and will only lead to confused and frustrated parents, I would disagree. As a man who wants to love his children and communicate the Love he has them and for God and share with them the power of living a close relationship to God.In our world it is good to have healthy direction and one that comes with the readability.One I reccomend.GS"
2,Good as a companion book only!,Although I found the general idea of this book helpful the practical application was wanting. The title will catch you but after the first five chapters you will find it is filled far more with recollections from the authors childhood then with realistic pracical application. At times this book is slightly unbeliveable. This book should be read only after solid biblical child rearing is in place in your home (read Shepherding a Child's Heart). It can help to keep things balanced but without a solid foundation I fear this book good bring about other less profitable results. I can say I gained a better perspecitve of the need to value and take time with my children but that could have been accomplished with less enlarged portrayals of sometimes unrealistic allowances. I would recomend this book but only cautiously.
3,Horrible editing on this e-book!,"I just finished reading this book on my Kindle and was completely disappointed with the editing. It was as if someone ran it through a computer program and then never bothered to check to see if spell-check worked correctly on it! It was missing periods, commas, apostrophes, etc... The words ""he'll"" and ""we'll"" repeatedly showed up as ""hell"" and ""well"". It made for difficult reading and continuous re-reading of certain sentences and passages.As for the actual content of the book, I found it far-fetched and highly unlikely for most people to live out in this current day and age. Had a few good ideas and suggestions, but took way too many pages for him to get to the point."

3,Not a too much excited read,"Is there anyone who could tell me that in the real conversation of our real lives, we would use the abbre. word ""i.e."" in any of our speaking sentence? There are so many ""i.e.(s)"" in this book 's dialogue that really turned me off. Besides, what's the big deal of the whole story? Car Noir of L.A.? Wow, what a inventive marketing pitch? What I've read about those engine powers and those car models in this book seemed all got nothing to do with anything with anybody, only the so-called heroine's trade-in Ford Escort, the Integra, the red pickup and Vito's Mercedes got related to this so-called car-noir book."
5,Delightful; funny; refreshing. The bumbling klutz as hero.,"Phillip Reed's first novel is a success. Harold Dodge, womanizer wannabe, friend to the down-trodden, and bumbler extraordinaire, tries to correct a friend's bad business deal and ends up in a deep pile of trouble. Of course, he can't do this alone, he takes those close to him down with him. Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does and the book ends. Harold Dodge is definitely the everyman of the genre. Were it not for the writing being a little rough in some places I might rate this a 10. Phillip reed has indicated he is working on a sequel to clean up Harold's mess. Fortunately, I doubt one book will be enough to do that and I'm sure a 10 is just around the corner."
5,Great Card - But Cautious,"This is a Great class-2 SDHC card. This card was included with my Panasonic SD1 camcorder. I used this card in my Panasonic SD1 camcorder and the video recording and playback is perfect. No Pauses, breaks .. etcA Word of Caution: Not all digital cameras and camcorders use SDHC cards, be sure to check the compatibility before ordering the card."
4,For a fan of good-ole-rock n roll,Several unreleased gems highlight this welcomed addition to the Humble Pie catalog. High and happy and the organ pumping Cocaine get your mojo working. It's easy to see these sessions were all about fun. Too bad it went unreleased until 97. I definetly recommend the purchase of this CD
4,Second outing better than the first!,"West's second (and, unfortunately, last) book in this series doesn't have all the exposition of the first, so he can get down to the nitty-gritty. The story jams, the art is solid and flows pleasantly. Why Scholastic stopped here is a real mystery!"
4,cool little vampire comic,"Im 20 years old and collect vampire comics so when i bought the 2 books in this series, it was mainly because the graphics were cool. But i actually found myself impressed with Lilly the main character, she has all these normal teenage thoughts and emotions and on top of that she has to deal with being a vampire. Its a good beginer book for kids they'll love the pictures and be able to relate to Lilly."
5,cute as a button!!!,"This book is so fantastic! Not only does it teach farm animals and opposites but you can count flowers or bugs, learn colors, tell stories about what the animals are doing, and so much more. My two-year-old *loves* this book and always laughs when we get to the end. I love the cute pictures (the illustrator uses felt cutouts instead of drawings) and how much fun we have following the pig around. You won't be sorry if you buy it--it's a great book."
5,One of our favorites,My daughter loves this book and asks for it again and again. She loves all the little bugs illustrated with incredibly clever sewing techniques. I love looking at the illustrations and marvelling at the things one can do with pinking shears and rick-rack.
3,Not a fan,"Let me start by saying the book is cute enough generally. My one and only problem is the end of the book. It ends by saying ""some pigs are big and some pigs are small but this pig is my mom and she's biggest of all."" Seriously. I can't even read this to my son anymore without getting mad. Maybe it's just me. And no, I'm not big at all."
2,You need to have less of a chest...,"Nice construction, but it didn't hold up. Need another bra underneath and that wasn't the point of this purchase."
3,Not Great,"I've been shopping for a comfortable bra for a long time, so I bought this one with the hopes I had found one. I didn't. This is no more comfortable than an $11.00 bra bought from Walmart. I'd pass on it if you want comfort."
4,As advertised,"The capacity seems overstated, but if you're looking for a media cabinet and don't want to deal with the hassle of assembly, this is a good one. The only assembly required was installing the cabinet's four legs. Shelf installation was easy, and the plastic shelf supports seem more than strong enough.The cabinet was delivered in under two weeks via FedEx. It arrived intact. It's pretty hefty and the construction seemed solid. Aside from a small (almost invisible) dent that looks like a manufacturing defect and the fact that one door doesn't stay completely closed, I'm completely satisfied."
4,Joyful Comfort,"Feeder rebound from the suicide of drummer Jon Lee on their fourth release, Comfort in Sound, by acknowledging their loss, regrouping, and getting on with it. New stickman Mark Richardson anchors twelve searching songs - the personal best of Grant Nicholas and Taka Hirose. Nicholas is too sharp a songwriter to wallow in his personal loss, though Lee's memory hangs over the proceedings, informing the expert first single, ""Come Back Around"", as well as highlights ""Forget About Tomorrow"" and ""Just the Way I'm Feeling"". What's most striking throughout is how Feeder incorporate the elements of regret and loss into a generous, compassionate batch of songs. These journeyman rockers don't deny life's ugly surprises. They don't glorify it, either. Bloody and bowed they may be, but - death be damned - they continue to celebrate joy wherever they can find it."
2,Poor rendition of loved hymns,I was extremely disappointed in a lot of these hymns. The instrumental arrangements drowned out the vocal arrangements several times. A lot of the hymns were instrumental only and the arrangements were very loose interpretations to say the least. There are better arrangements out there - search further if you want to hear beautiful hymns!
2,Had Potential,"The music on this CD sounds fantastic, but BE AWARE that they are only short segments of the hymns. For example, I specifically bought the CD for ""Be Thou My Vision"", which is actually only a short instrumental, and ""Crown Him With Many Crowns"", which only had one verse. Not good for a rousing sing-along while you do the dishes!"
1,50 most terrible hymns,We are very disappointed with the quality of the cd's and trashed them. The sound level varied all over the place and made listening very annoying. One cd was defective and would not play. We purchased two albums and both had the varing sound level.
5,God's music uplifts the spirit,"His special music uplifts the spirit - always and in all ways. This is a wonderful 2 disc set that surrounds us in a sacred atmosphere. Like a sprinkle of rain on a sunny day, the sampling of favorite hymns refreshes and enlivens the heart."
2,Church Fare,"This is a 2 CD set with over 50 most celebrated church hymnals. The ones I was familiar with that we actually sang in church were: Holy holy Holy, Joyful Joyful We Adore Thee, Great is thy Faithfulness, Blessed Assurance, Rock of Ages and Amazing Grace. A decent collection for worship."
4,good traditional hymnody,The advantage of this CD over many others is that the words are understandable and the arrangements are familiar. The disadvantage is that the songs are not formated to be used on a device other than a CD player.
3,Holy Mary Awesomeness!,"Enjoyed listening to the songs, only issue was the songs were not as ""hymnal"" as I thought. Just my opinion, but other than that, the songs were nice. I ended up listening to the same songs online and found them to be more ""Churchish"""
2,"Beautiful music, but poorly mastered","'More Than 50 Most Loved Hymns' contains truly beautiful traditional hymns. However, the CD's are poorly mastered with volume all over the place and some chopped beginnings and endings. Unfortunately, at least two (2) of these wonderful hymns are chopped long before the ending(s). In an attempt to improve the basic listening experience, I burned my own CD's and left out the butchered ones. Therefore, I do not have what the album title implies! This is a ""BUYER BEWARE"" purchase!"
4,Pretty good,"I've enjoyed buying albums of hymns over the years and saw an ad on TV for this. Naturally, it was less expensive on Amazon.com, so I jumped at the chance to buy it. If you like this sort of album, you might also want to check out the one recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Those ladies in their beehive hairdos can really sing up a storm."
2,Unable to use.,"I am sure it is very good. Received as ""damaged"". Returned to amazon.com per the request from them and received a full refund."
2,More Than 50 Most Beloived Hymns,"Okay. Maybe too many selections? Not enough variety in musicians that performed. After awhile, all of the music sounds the same."
4,it's like one long medley,"So a lot of people helpfully noted in their reviews that the songs aren't really that long and I kept wondering exactly how short they are. For me, it was like a beautifully arranged long medley of hymns-- so the most you get is a verse per song. But the choral and instrumental versions are truly beautiful. But like another helpful reviewer noted, it really isn't right for a fun sing-a-long."
5,Darling Set!,"Bought these for a friend who has this dish pattern. They are a perfect size, clearly marked, and just darling. My friend was very pleased!"
4,Works great in a Treo 650,"No problems with this product so far. I'm using it to store music files for my Treo 650 Smartphone. The only thing that could be better is if it were a faster transfer speed. On the other hand, it is cheaper than the faster speed cards."
5,Handy dandy,"Nothing much to say about this little flash memory card other than it does what it's supposed to do. I usually download my pics immediately, so I don't have any storage issues. This drive hasn't backfired or acted funky, so I'm satisfied with it."
5,SD Memory card.,The price is what drew me to this 2Gig card. It was less than a 126 meg card. It has worked perfect so far. It now has about 800 photos on it and is only half full.
3,Good but not fast enough!,I've used Kingston products before and they are as reliable as any other brand. No issues so far. My only irritant is that it slow to write when taking a high resolution photo.It handles Meduim resolution photo's without any delays. Then again everything depends on the megapixel rating of your camera. I use it on a 7.1 MP Canon and its slow only in super fine mode. It handles most night time photo's quickly too only in fine or medium settings. I tend to take most photo's in high resolution so I can zoom in and crop out area's I dont need. Will need to invest in a High speed SD card for those photo's :)
4,2GB SD Card,"I got 5 of these SD cards for my digital picture frame and for my Canon camera they work great and the price was perfect, very good buy!"
5,Great for cameras & GPS,Bought this for my MIO GPS device. It easily loaded 2 gig of music that I can plug and play. Got another for grandchildren's pictures to carry along and bore everybody.
4,Flash Card,Great for a point and shoot where you don't need the faster speed of the more expensive cards.
4,Order filled with another brand,Order was filled by Overstocks Closeouts in the Market Place.Another brand of media was shipped and received. When I contacted the shipper they came back after a week and said they wouldreplace the order with Kingston media...I still await the arrival of them....Kingston chips have served me well in the past and expect the same from the new ones.
2,Freezes up!,I bought this for my camera over two months ago. I've had nothing but problems out of my camera (freezing up) after using this card. I put in another card (Kodak) and it works great. This card is junk and I don't recommend it to anyone!
1,Not really a 2 GB Card,"So, I'm *hoping* they've fixed this, but the last two I've ordered of these both only allowed 600 MB or less to be written on them. I ordered the first, returned it and got a second and it allowed even less data to be written to it. I returned that one as well and asked for a refund."
4,a lot of memory in a small package,They work; it's wonderful to be able to carry around so much memory in such a tiny chip.
3,Doesn't work with Tungsten E2,"I wish I'd known this before purchasing the item. Palm Tungsten E2 only supports 1gb sd memory cards!The item itself probably works ok, but I wouldn't know, since it doesn't work with my E2."
3,Free gift with my camera purchase,I can't really give this a review as I have yet to use it. It came with my camera purchase as a free gift. I'll be happy to give a review as soon as I use this product.
1,DUE TO REC. NOV 3..STILL NOTHING,"I ORDERED 2 CARDS..2G...DELV. DATE SHOWS NOV 3..ESTIMATE..SAYS..UNKOWN SHIPPER...HAVE LONG CONF. #...HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT AMAZON AND KINGSTON TO NO AVAIL..WHAT HAPPENED..WAS IT THE MAD ""OPRAH"" RUSH ON ""KINDLE'S""..RAN OUT...MINE SHOWS SHIPPED..JUST HAVE NO CLUE..WHERE IT IS 2 WEEKS AFTER DUE DATE...HELP"
1,Poor SD card - Don't let the price get to you!!!,"I bought this SD card for a Fuji camera I bought through Amazon, this SD card produce some of the worst quality picture's. I knew the SD card was bad, because I had a different type of of card (XD) that the camera could used and it produce nice picture's. I tried to format this SD card a few times with the camera and on my computer and it still seem defective so I had to returned it to Amazon so don't let the price buy you."
4,Standard SD card,Seems to work as expected. Transfer speed seems a little low but it works fine with all of my cameras.
5,Overnight Shipment!!!,"Was here very next day, before my mom got here to get her other mother's day present, which of course was a camera, and I put it in, and it worked with no problems, and I own a lot of memory cards, and Kingston is one of the best out there for memory hold, and loved the price, but don't we all love something that is way cheaper than the original price lol."
3,OK product and performance for that time,OK product and performance for that time. For the time being was satisfactory but memories have come down in price and increase in capacity at a very fast rate
4,I didn't use untill now,Sorry. I live in Brazil the stuffs went received in USA by my son. I only will use when I will go to my's son graduation. I think that is a good product because I already have one.
2,Not enough info,"This SD card worked on xp but not on Vista,I was not made aware of this technical information"
1,Misleading 60 cent add,"All the way through to the final click this item is being shown as being purchased for 60 cents. When you get to the final window, after entering all your credit card info., it is full price, the same as if you bought it on the Kingston site. Very disappointed in this ad and the time I took to go that far."
4,Very Happy with Kingston 2GB Card,I have taken a few dozens pictures with the card and I am extremely happy with it's performance. It's a great buy at Amazon and I highly recommend this card for all general use.
5,Cheap and good,"Bought this one for a digital foto frame. So I guess, my review wouldn't be much useful for those who want to buy this card for digital cameras.The product is good and reliable. Transfer speeds are good.My suggestion - if you want something for a digital camera, get a fast one with better technology. This one is for casual use only.Would definitely recommend this product for what it's worth.Got 2 of these for a very low price. Am happy :)"
2,Defective or just unreliable?,I purchased this memory card with my camera. We had only used it for a week or so when for some reason the card would not read or write. We ended up having to lose LOTS of pictures because we had not transferred the pictures to the computer for about 3 days. We are still using the memory card but transfer pictures every day now to make sure this doesn't happen again.
3,Good product with minor problems,The card is a good card for use in my digital camera. However if you want to use the pictbridge compatibility you won't be able to. I purchased my digital camera because it had this camibility as well as the printer I already had does. The only problem is that this particular card apparently does not work well that way. I used it once through the pictbridge program and now it will not read the card at all. I have to connect the camera through the USB to download my pictures to the computer before I can print them out. At least I did not lose any of my pictures but it does take more time to do it this way because the computer must be on. Where if you can use the pictbridge feature the computer does not have to be on just the printer. Overall it does hold plenty of pictures and video.
1,not fully functional,"Took firat 23 photos on my Kodak camera using this disk, and I was not able to get the disk to upload the pictures to a computer. Tried two different computers. Both said the photos were in an unrecognizable format. Was able to use the photos only by connecting the camera to the computer by USB cable."
5,Great value with a reputable brand!!!,"It was the cheapest 2GB card at the time without the risk of a shady vendor or brand. Kingston is a reputable brand. Card worked perfectly. I honestly thought 2GB was a little overkill, but it's nice to have some spare room to play with video recordings on the digital camera."
1,Not worth the lower price. Sandisk the best.,Kingston 2GB SD card worked at first for about several hundred photos. It stills works in the camera. But now my computer card reader does not recognize it. My other much older Sandisk SD cards can still be read.
2,LOCKED UP MY CAMERA EVEN AFTER FORMATTING!!!,This card is terrible. Even after formatting this card several times it still locked up my camera. Had to get a new card during our vacation.
4,Snap Snap,"I bought this for my camera, seems to do fine for the pics I take. If you want speed of course you will have to purchase the high speed card. But for what I was looking for, this works well so far."
4,some issue with older card reader,"It worked fine at first, but after putting over 1G of pictures on it, my 5year old card reader has not been able to access the files when inserted. Got a new card reader recently, and that worked fine and at much faster speeds too. Interesting thing is that the old card reader still reads other cards fine, including a 2Gb high speed card from PQI. So, just to be aware if you have an older USB 1.1 card reader."
4,Performed as expected.,"This product arrived in it's own case, and performed as expected when used. I am currently viewing photos on a digital frame supplied by the memory chip."
4,Secure Digital Memory,"I purchased this item as a present for someone else, I have used Kingston Memory cards before and have always been pleased. This was a good product at a very good price."
5,great for all file types,"i used this 2GB card to sync the songs that i really like, it took just about 10min. to tranfer 230 songs, wile inside of the RCA 256mb mp3 player that i have. And had about 1GB of space left over for more storage."
5,"Cheap, fast, reliable","I bought this to use with my Nintendo Wii for Rock Band 2.It's pretty fast. It transfers songs back and forth from the card in a few seconds. It hasn't had a single error or any other issue. It's the perfect storage size for a Wii, though of course you can use it for anything.It does the job, and it's so cheap you shouldn't pass it up."
5,SD memory card,Excellent product ... exactly as described. Sent quickly with great communication. I was notified when the item was shipped and when to expect it. Quicker that I expected. I would recommend this seller.
4,That little card that could...,"Kingston has a good name in flash drive technology. They build quality products and stand behind the sale. The 2GB Card is a great size. It can be used in older devices and with the latest technology. It is surprising fast for a class 2 card. It handles 720p video without glitches and allows for a fairly quick file transfers from the camera to the memory card. Of course, a lot depends on your camera's buffering capabilites. These smaller cards have a hidden value in that they can be used and then placed in a safe place other than your equipment bag. If you have ever had a camera with a 8GB card lost or stolen you quickly realized that unless you backed up your photographs and videos to a laptop or memory storage device you have lost an entire trip's worth of memories."
1,do not work properly,That product do not work with targus presenter and i call amazon and i call Galatic but the product is stil there for sale.this is very bad for amazon.I will never buy from Galatic again
3,No protective case,"Card is ok but packaging is only bubble wrap, no plastic case to keep the SD in while not in use.lcjones"
2,Works in camera but not recognized by 2 computers,"I would not recommend this card. It cannot be recognized in two different computers with SD card readers. Windows gives an error message. One is a WinXP and the other a Vista computer. Like another reviewer, I must download from the camera and then it is a very slow process reading the card. I would not trust this card for taking important pictures."
4,Exactly what you'd expect,"I bought this for use in my Palm T|X to store files. I've had it for about a month, but there have been no problems with it, either reading or writing. There's still that little issue about how gigabytes are counted (this 2 GB card has only about 1.9 GB), but other than that I've been pleased with it. And the price is pretty darn good too."
4,Quality SD card at a good price,"I ordered this SD card to install in our WII. It arrived quickly and was packaged well - but not wastefully so. Installed quickly and has worked perferctly. I didn't expect the fastest transfer rate with this card, but it meets advertised specs and workd great for my application."
5,Working great,"I've had this for more than a year now. It's been working flawlessly the whole time. I use it in multiple devises to move data around.I had a different Kingston device, that had problems out of the package. I called Kingston and they sent a replacement immediately with postage paid return packaging. That was great customer service."
5,"Good price, good product",Worked perfectly with my Canon A710. I can store lots of pictures and several videos before I have to delete everything. It is also very fast and hasn't failed me yet!
5,Works Great!,"I bought this for my IPAQ to get some extra storage. It was well priced and easy to use. All I do is put it in my memory card reader on my laptop, copy over files, and that's it!"
2,Does not feel good,The SD card feels cheap. The first time I inserted the card in my digital camera it was not recognized.Also my computer does not read the card and freezes when i insert the card in the SD-slot of my pc.I only managed to retrieve the photos of the sd card by connecting the camera to my pc via usb.
2,Dead after 13 months,"Great price and performance, no issues with compatibility but died after 13 months of normal use, hate it for a minute as I lost the chance to take some great pictures of my son. I've had, actually still have, some SD from Sandisk for some years (cell phone, Camera) and have not had a single failure, wouldn't recommend to buy this product"
5,Kingston - king of memories,I use Kingston storage devices for more then 10 years. They are the king !!!!! I recommend every single item they manufacture.
1,Dissatisfied,"I bought this memory card in conjunction with a digital frame as a Christmas present for my Mom. I spent days loading hundreds of pictures onto this card, and when I went to put it into the frame, discovered it was corrupt. It erased the hard drive of the digital frame, and erased everything I spent precious time creating on the memory card. I do not reccommend it at all.I gave it one star because I had to, but it doesn't even deserve that."
1,I Would Get a Different Card...,"I bought this SD Card for my Canon S3 IS no more than a month ago, and it doesn't work anymore. It lasted for a very short period of time, I took care of it, kept it in my camera, but when I went to take pics, it said ""Memory Card Error"" I do not recommend this card to anyone who is looking for a decent card. I would go with a ScanDisk in the future. I hope this helps you guys.-Tim"
4,Memory card,It works as well as any other memory card. Best thing is it was free! I ordered a camera as a holiday gift and the memory card was included free with camera. I left a review on the camera it works great. The price and shipping were all good. I have always liked any product I have gotten from Amazon. Will continue to shop here!
3,You get what you pay for,"It's a memory card, how can it not perform the basic function that it's supposed to do? Obviously, the product works and at a tempting price when lined up against similar products. I use the one given to me with the purchase of a digital camera. The problem I've noticed is a s-l-o-w write speed, e.g., I take a picture and it takes 2-3 s. to store before I can take another picture. I have a Sandisk 1GB in my PDA phone and when I plugged that card in, I could hardly detect a lag time between shooting pictures.My advice, spend the extra $15 on a Sandisk, Olympus, Fuji, etc..., stay with the known, reputable brands. It's worth the extra change."
5,Obsolete 2 GB storage disc for your older model digital camera,"My early model digital camera only takes a 2 GB storage, so this was important to me to find one of these, since they are now considered obsolete. Make sure you need this model to suit your camera before you buy it, so you won't be disappointed."
1,Buy two reports and only sent me one,"Hola soy de venezuela Greetings, I feel a little insecure my last purchase was a digital camera and two memory 2gb, and was sent only when the camera came with a single report, it is noteworthy that the two reports were received ... you can do in that case?"
4,Yup it's an SD card alright.,"Read and Write speeds are horrible but if you are just looking for an SD card for your camera this fits the bill at an awesome price. As usual with Kingston, doesn't come with anything extra or fancy, just the SD, nothing but the SD. Good price, reliable card, recommended."
4,Good memory card,"What's to say? It's a regular sd card that works fine in my panasonic camera. If you're looking for speed, this is not it."
5,"Great price, quality memory card","I purchased this to add memory to a digital photo frame for my mother. It works very well and it's Kingston. The price was great too. Perhaps it's not as fast as possible, but most people won't need the faster speed cards."
4,great value with fast shipping,I ordered this poduct several days before Christmas with free shipping! I received my purchase before the holidays. Great work and great value. Thank you very much.
5,2GB SD Flash Memory Card,This card was really cheap and holds lots of pictures. It was a great find!!
5,Why Kingston?,"Excellent product!!! I have over 10 years of buying ONLY Kingston for RAM memory, Flash Drives, SD cards and other types of memories, even the first ones I bought are still working!!!"
4,No carrying case; otherwise fine,"Haven't used my cards a lot, they're spares for music students' lesson audio...but I think I trust the Kingston brand, I've used their Mac SIMM's which were flawless.Only negative: these cards are blister packed and come without the little protective carrying case, which I needed and wanted. That info was nowhere to be found on Amazon, or at the vendor's page. The Amazon vendor didn't have empty cases. Found some at Fry's, so problem solved. But still, added another step to the whole process which didn't please me."
4,Kinston 2 gig flash card,I was just looking for a basic no frills card to take .jpgs to the store for printing. It fills the bill.
1,Not satisfied,"Kingston must be the only company which ships SD cards with no sleeve or any other protective device. It just comes plain in the retail packaging.What do they think you do with the existing SD cards, or how do you carry multiple cards for your camera?Sorry, but this deserves a negative review. The cards are all the same anyway and now Kingston buyers are stuck with having to buy an extra case for the card. Cost == more than the card.Last Kingston product for me."
2,Hmmm...,This is still out for verdict. I tried to use this card through my laptop and it's not working.
3,"A pretty good adventure, worth seeing.","Gods Must Be Crazy, Out Of Africa, or Hatari, it ain't. What it is, instead, is a good and fun adventure in Kenya. Brian Denehey is terrific as the stubborn-old-coot-safari-guy. It has moments of charm and wild abandon. The cinematography is excellent. You'll love just watching the African scenery go by. The story leaves something to be desired. But, on the whole, it's a pretty good movie."
3,"A ""Fun"" Movie","No, it isn't high theater but it is a good movie to sit down in front of with a big bowl of popcorn, a cold beer and maybe the lady in your life for an enjoyable weekend afternoon diversion.Brian Dennehy has the ""borderline obnoxious but deep down you know there's a heart of gold"" character down pat and he plays it to the hilt here. The scenery is great, particularly if you're stuck inside on a cloudy, rainy day.A good, fun flick."
5,Great movie,"Great family movie! Action, romance, comedy all in one. Worth watching! Saw it a long time ago and would love to see it come out in a DVD! Know it was a ""made for TV"" movie, but would love to buy it"
4,The Lion of Africa,"Originally a documentary produced by HBO in 1987, this is an adventure movie that did not have that ""feel"". Fast-paced and spot-on dynamic, Brian Dennehy was superb as a big-hearted rogue in South Africa with an aging, growling bush truck he dubbed ""The Lion of Africa"". Thoroughly entertaining and informative at the same time, it was a gem of a purchase, even though it is now only available in VHS format and was purchased used from a party in Europe. It arrived as agreed, with a thank you note from the seller. All around, a great deal."
4,Destiny's Child...Can they do wrong?,"Destiny's Child has finally released a retail single of their #1 hit, ""Independent Women"", in an effort to cash in some more on the song before it's popularity beings to run out. The girls have packed the single with remixes that leave much to be desired, but the single's saving grace is the Christmas B-side. Overall, the CD is ok, thought I would have much rathered ""Independent Women Part II"" to be a track, like they got on the English CD."
2,Same old stuff...,"This single isn't quite worth the money. The remixes aren't all that great and the the original...SAME OLD ""I buy my own things"", ""Buy my own rings"", ""Don't need any man"" type song. Something NEW please! I enjoy Destiny's Child, but come on!"
2,How desperate are you?,"Let me start off by saying that the song ""Independent Women"" is a 5 star song. Buy this maxi single ONLY if you don't want to buy the ""Charlie's Angels"" soundtrack. That's what I did. I knew that I loved this song that much. Generally I don't like maxi-singles because if you have heard one dance mix, you've heard them all. This isn't an exception. But, I figured buying this over the soundtrack was the lesser of two evils. Unfortunately my CD is in my car, but I can tell you that track 4, which is one of the dance mixes is a great mix. It contains a little Santana-like guitar in the background, and is faster paced. In fact the vocals were redone for this version. Track 5 is a new Christmas song from them called ""8 Days of Christmas."" It's pretty good. I think these girls can pretty much release a song with them snoring and it would go number one. I am concerned, though. How much longer can they have success talking about no good men and being able to buy what they want?"
2,POOR QUALITY,"The mixes left SO much to be desired. I can't even believe I spent money on this single. Usually I like Destiny's Child but this single is not worth it to me at all.If you want to hear good remixes, then listen to Mariah Carey's!I've learned my lesson and will never buy a single from Destiny's Child ever again!P.s. the main song is good, but all else is trash, hehe"
5,Ka'au Kind of Day,"Excellent! Exemplifies the ""Aloha Spirit"" with a mixture of old and new... traditional Hawaiian music, as well as remakes of songs from the sixties and seventies. Good, clear vocals and harmony; great instrumentals! Crank up the music and head for the beach!"
5,"""Feel Good"" music","A rare and wonderful blend of old and new... Hawaiiana, plus remakes of songs from the sixties and seventies with an island flavor! Fabulous two-part harmony, guitar and ukulele!"
3,cute but not easy to turn on,"The switch is halfway down the back of the cord instead of on the lampbase, making it difficult to find in the middle of the night."
2,Found a Better Price Online,"I just love this 6 Piece bedding set and all the assessories you can buy as well. However, I found a site that is MUCH cheaper. I bought the set from www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com. Here are the price differences:6 piece crib set burlington (BLT) 144.46 vs. BRU 179.99,lamp base and lamp shade together for BLT 33.96 vs BRU 49.98,extra window valance BLT 16.96 vs. BRU 19.99,growth chart BLT 16.99 vs. BRU 19.99,5 piece wall hanging set BLT 21.21 vs. BRU 24.99,picture frame BLT 11.04 vs. BRU 12.99,night light BLT 8.49 vs BRU 12.99,barnyard switch plate BLT 8.49 vs BRU 9.99,mobile BLT 33.96 vs. 39.99.I think I have made my point. Just with what I have listed I am going to save $75.34. Hope I have helped you save some money too!"
3,"very cute, but not that useful",This lamp is really nice looking. The intricate design and painting on it are gorgeous. But its not much light at all. Very dim. And the switch to turn it on is on the cord and I'm fumbling behind the dresser to turn it on. We had to add another lamp in the room for light. But we still love this set and how cute the lamp is.
5,One savors every lyric...,"I first heard Mercedes Sosa several years ago on my first trip to Argentina when I was a young man, fresh out of university. I was captivated by her grace and singing then and she reminded me a lot of Montserrat Caballé of Spain, whom I saw at the Edinburgh Festival one August when I was still a college student. 30 Años is a very powerful yet romantic album. It's the kind of album you want to play when making a passionate love to your wife. Mercedes Sosa's voice penetrates to your heart and gives you that additional kick which brings out the most poetic, tender passion in you. In this CD one savors every lyric of each song that Sosa masterfully interprets. My favorite song is Alfonsina Y El Mar. Buy it, you will love it."
2,The stupid thing doesn't whistle!,"I thought for sure I had found the right tea kettle, with a whistle that could be heard throughout the house but alas, no matter how long the water boils, I cannot get the thing to whistle. What a disappointment!Lisa"
2,Cute but didn't whistle,"Can only second the other reviewers: looks cute, but it only whistled 2-3 times, then no more."
5,This one's a keeper,"Like a lot of others I got turned on to these fellows in a smoke filled 70's campus apartment and enjoyed the quality songwriting and perfect harmonies with good friends. This collection contains a very balanced combination of original tunes and other song writers. Jesse Winchester's ""Yankee Lady"" is a classic and the two Dylan tunes ""All Along The Watchtower"" and ""The Mighty Quinn"" are interpreted in a very comfortable coffee house style. Their original songs reflect on a time when the sixties expressionism hadn't given up to cocaine and disco. It was a special, albeit brief, time when two guys in flannel shirts and acoustic guitars could get by with small clubs and college auditoriums. The original songs are a perfect combination of lyric and solid playing that intertwines the mind and the soul. Enjoy."
3,Has potential,"A few songs are quite good but some are not. It's painful to listen to Ho'oheno Ku'u Sweetie. Listen to Darlene Ahuna sing it and compare.Give Anelaikalani a few years, she does have potential."
4,Historical fiction that pulls you in and never lets you go,This story shows us things are always different when they're happening to you. These three accidental time travelers are sent to a time they thought they knew. They were right and wrong. This story takes off quickly and doesn't slow down moving between the present and the past without losing the reader. The reader learns a lot about a day in the life of a Civil War foot soldier and his friends during the most significant battle in our history. An excellent first effort. I hope the Enfield is just the beginning for Mr. Kevin.
5,infoseek,"Veronica Castro only get's better with every effort she releases and make's the song's her own, altho on few ocassion's she contributes to the song's lyric's. The best beloved track that melt's your heart is ""Apariencias"" that is nothing like the rest of the album, it includes the hit video/song, ""Tu La Tienes Que Pagar"" and ""El Quebradito."" Another hip charismatic song is ""Vamonos Al Dancing."" The ranchera ""Mal Perdedor"" to Omar Fiero? The album is Excellent, don't miss it!!!!!!"
2,Great book but lousy binding quality,"I was really disappointed by the quality of the binding: pages kept falling as I was turning them.So, to keep it short:- 5 stars for the contents of the book- ZERO for the binding."
1,Bad Movie,"This is not a good movie !!!!!!!!! in fact, one of the worst movies I ever seen. I heard about this movie by a friend, thet sad it was a pretty good movie. But when I saw it , it was not good at all, not one good actor/actressI can't recomend anyone to see this movie."
1,"Estrich is clueless, arrogant, and annoying","This democrat apologist has no credentials compared to Ann Coulter. She doesn't understand politics at all -- remember her reliance on exit polling in the last national election and she got it all wrong. Her sarcastic tone isn't enlightening, isn't clever, it's just hateful, whereas Ann's sarcasm is backed up by facts, citations, statistics, and well reasoned argument. Susan Estrich wishes she were as influential as Ann Coulter, but lady, it's not going to happen -- you're a loser, face it. And you started the personal attacks, so back they come - your ideas stink, you stink, and you represent what's wrong with democrats -- whiners and losers taking credit for the creativity of others."
3,mistaken,"the most critical mistake that estrich makes is that she acts as if coulter writes about the liberals, for the liberals. she doesn't. she writes for the extreme conservatives and liberals in no way are supposed to be amused, or are supposed to 'get' anything out of her writing.if there is any coulter critic book that should be trusted, it should be written by a moderate ring wingest, not susan estrich. estrich is also a bit paranoid that somehow coulter will take over the world. go to the streets of new york and ask anyone over the age of 18 if they know who ann coulter is. the numbers will speak for itself.and fyi to ms. estrich, michelle malkin is nothing like ann coulter, and doesn't even try to be. open your eyes a little."
5,"Ms. Estrich, thank you for your passionate and smart arguments","If you are not familiar with Susan Estrich's work, pick up a copy of ""Soulless"" and get ready for a great read! With so many people sounding-off on politics these days, it's hard to find a sincere and informed voice in the mix. Ms. Estrich writes with integrity and clarity, looking beyond the bi-partisan rhetoric that Ms. Coulter loves to tout. I used to wonder why so many Americans are divided on important issues such as reducing crime, improving the quality of education, and ensuring that equal rights are protected under federal law- it turns out that Americans aren't as divided as some would have us believe. If you're looking for an inspiring examination of what is wrong with politics today and what it would take to make things better, read this book- you'll want to recommend it to all of your friends as well!"
2,This liberal was mostly unimpressed.,"Estrich isn't a great writer, but seems like she's astute enough to recognize a marketable book idea when it comes along. Coulter's divisive, dishonest, mean-spirited political hate-speech doesn't deserve as much attention as she gets here, or anywhere else. The best parts of the book are when Estrich talks about the issues, like the politicization of sexual harassment and rape, which she approaches from the perspective of an experienced lawyer."
2,Eh....,"I'll admit that I'm not a fan of Anne Coulter, but Susan is not exactly a great alternative either. I didn't finish this book, but I tried reading one of Anne's books and I didn't finish that one either. In the last year I have become cynical of politics in general. Right-Wing and Left-Wing pundits are too focused on annihilating each other. And the battle seems to continue with this book to it's predictable counter arguments and smearing of Anne Coulter, not based on her politics as much as personal attacks. Which is basically what politics is. You can skip this and basically watch the pundits slug it out on cable news networks. Save your money."
1,Factless,"Estrich is as shrill and clueless as she purports Coulter to be.The rah rah pom pom gal for the left isn't factually fit enough to clean the keyboard for Coulter.This is a poor attempt at satire, at best and even more poor attempt at taking Coulter to task for telling the truth about the left and the drive by media's left leaning bias.Jealousy, thy name is Estrich."
1,jsanders,The book and cover are like the author-ugly and untruthful. Maybe all the stars from Air America will buy a copy...
1,Eeeuuwww!,"Now there's a stomach-wrenching experience for you -- Susan Estrich trying to look like Ann Coulter. Actually it doesn't even look like Susan Estrich, since her humungous mouth is closed which is never the case when Ms. Estrich is seen on TV. Clever try, Susan, but it's unlikely it will put your book anywhere near Ann's in sales figures."
1,Friends Susan?,"The fact that Estrich actually went through with this delusional book cover tells me that Susan has no friends. I mean come on, didn't anyone tell her that maybe imitating a hot babe like Ann Coulter would make her look ridiculous by comparison? This picture is like being forced to look at an 80 year-old woman who's on the beach in a bikini. It's embarassing to look at. If Susan has any friends they should be ashamed of themselves for letting her do this to herself. Because this is FUGLY."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Wow Susan you are #20,505 on Amazon. Really impressive. Well done.that says it all. Get a life. And you wonder why you guys can't get over 50% of the vote? Your atheistic hate filled world veiw aint sellin Susan."
2,Estrich reactionary book,Coulter has brought syllogism to an art form. It is sad that Estrich misses the subtlety of much of Coulter's style. Perhaps Estrich does not know the meaning of syllogism. Estrich has indeed put herself in the mold of Al Franken. Her sophomoric book is purely a reaction to Ann Coulter. Estrich like many of Coulter's detractor's constantly take her out of context and misquote her. I am surprised that Estrich would be this shallow.
1,A disappointed Liberal,I consider myself pretty liberal and find some of the other reviews just plane hateful and name calling. However for myself I have just finished both books and I must say I had a great respect for Susan Estrich but now have none.
1,Susan Estrich is a brainless hack,"Soulless is a personal attack on Ann Coulter, The cover shows how un-original liberals are, it's supposed to be her dressed as Ann. It looks more like a cross between Ann and Meatloaf.If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. That's apparently the mantra of liberal authors who can't stop Ann Coulter's popularity on TV and in the book world.Ann Coulter is brutally honest. At times honesty proves to be most unkind. But that's just the way it is. Sometimes Ann Coulter treats the liberal left as they have treated her, and they don't like it. But I can't recall anytime where she was hateful as Estrich has been.As far as her detractors calling her brainless, well, just consider the ignorance of thesource.Susan Estrich's Dumb Ann Coulter Attacks are ""WITLESS"""
1,Susan is no Ann Coulter!,"Why would anyone spend money for this book? It is just more whining. Susan needs to get her own material and stop trying to be an imitation of someone else. Isn't Susan happy in her own skin and with her own looks?Ann has the facts on her side. Susan represents the party that is quite happy taking scissors and sticking them in the back of the neck of a partially born baby whom they want to kill. Need I say more about who is ""Soulless and Godless""? Don't waste your time and money with this book."
5,thank you,Super quick service. More than in time for the class my son is taking. thank you. sorry i am so late.
3,an introductory text,"This book and the workbook were required for a machine shop class I took. The Amazon description is pretty accurate. It is written for someone in a vocational training program who will be working in the industry rather than a home workshop. The book covers a lot of material, but doesn't go into depth on any of it. Its a pretty good introductory book, but its kind of expensive. I wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't required for the class. If you are just interested in learning to operate a certain machine, like a mill or lathe, or if you are interested in machining as a hobby I think there are probably better books. I am giving it 3 stars because of the high price, and many of the photos are not high enough quality, especially considering the price."
5,As a Training Tool,Purchased this book as a training tool for young engineering employees to learn how parts are manufactured.Great learning tool.
5,I like it.,"I cant say much, because I have heard of better books, but I think it is good for a lab class in machining. I would recommend it for those who need to learn the subject immediately."
5,adorable,this little decoration is perfect size weight and nicely painted . the price was great for the quality. We are both very happy with the purchase and cant wait to see it on our wedding cake.
4,Love this---especially Opihi Man!,"I first heard Opihi Man at a hula show in Kona given by a local hula halau. Loved the song then went to a record store and (badly) sang it for the clerk. He pointed me in the direction of this CD. But Opihi Man is only one of the great songs on this CD! The vocals, harmonies, and guitar playing are great, and it brings me back to driving the back roads of all the islands. Even people not familiar with Hawaiian music will like this CD."
3,didn't do much,"I have been using this a few times a week for over a month now, and I have seen little to no improvement in my nails."
5,Perfect.,This is an incredible product that seems to last forever. I always end up using it until the gold has rubbed off the label haha I just put a dab of oil on each nail and rub it all over my nail and cuticle.
5,LOVE this stuff!,"My skin is SOOO dry that it cracks and bleeds around my nails (I'm a really bad biter, and I bite the skin, too.) This is the only thing that gives quick relief and moisture right where I need it to go. Again, I LOVE it."
4,Tea Party Anybody???,"I bought this for my daughter, but she's too young for it right now. I couldn't beat the price that I ended up paying..."
2,clothing measures,"clothing measures are not shown in table, Large shirt far too large and does not correspond.y no es una pequeña diferencia que se pueda arreglar facilmente."
5,Great seller,This item is great if you love Whitney Mixter it is a must have for your collection. She is Really great in it and this seller is a really great one
1,Bad,"Possibly worste movie put together ever. The sound was so hard to hear. The movie was like someone grabbed a home camera and just played pretend. Only reason I watched it was to give it a shot since it had Whitney Mixter in it, the actors did a fine job but whoever put the whole thing together did a really bad job."
1,Embarrassing.,"I pre-ordered this dvd as soon as the Real L Word was over. Being a fan of Whitney Mixter, I thought this would be a fun corny movie. But this is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible and you can tell the actors forget their lines mid sentence.The action sequences are embarrassing. Awful sound effects and muzzle flares aren't believable at all. The blood shooting out of the zombies when shot looks drawn in and the zombie make up just looks like people throwing together a zombie costume 5 minutes before they have to go to a Halloween Party.I have seen 15 year old kids on YouTube make better looking stuff than this.I shut the movie off about 50 minutes in, but everything about the movie is horrible. Definitely was not worth the delay, I don't see how it could have been worse."
5,WHY!,"Why do yall keep changing the release date?! I love Whitney Mixter, and i really want this movie, but im not going to pre order it if ill never get it?"
4,Is There a Doc In The House?,"Doc Powell has always been one of my favorite guitarists and I was not disappointed with this CD. I enjoy his renditions of ""Breezin"" and ""What's Going On"", as well as the songs ""Ode To Chet"" and ""Two Hearts"". ""Two Hearts"" reminds me somewhat of his great cut ""Charlene"" from the Laid Back CD."
1,I wish you could give a minus star - Very disappointed,"My uncle bought one for me at the PX as a present, and I felt terrible that it didn't even work 1 month. It barely stayed on long enough to warm up rice let alone cook rice, when it did work. It quickly stopped working, altogether. The cord can be used to work with the new rice cooker that you purchase from some other brand. I cook lots of brown rice and needed a dependable appliance that my kid could easily turn on and have rice with a crock pot meal."
5,Rand McNally receives a thumbs up,"I bought this atlas for my boss who is on the road a lot. This atlas is accurate, detailed, and the words are ledgable.The vinyl cover is nice for protecting the pages."
4,Good atlas,I needed to update my atlas and the 05 is much better than the newer ones as the pages are thicker and less likely to tear with use.
5,Indispensible tool for the cross-country driver,"Planning a road trip? This Rand McNally road atlas is all you need. I'm ready to get a new '07 Atlas since my '04 Atlas has gotten so much use. It's got character: the cover has long since fallen off, coffee stains galore, and many a tear and loose pages. This is all I've needed to successfully navigate cross-country from California to Maryland and back. I've also used it to drive up and down the eastern seaboard and roaming the Southwest United States.Hands down, the best investment you can make in a road atlas."
3,"Beautiful, abstract","George Washington is beautifully photographed. The colors are vivid and saturated, and the framing is excellent. Occasionally the cinematography is distracting, with jarring zooms and pans. But for the most part, it's a delight to watch.The plot is barely there, and that made it a little hard to watch. 89 minutes is a long time to look at pretty pictures with very little story. The acting is a mixed bag; some performances are convincing, some are artificial. If you're looking for a movie where something happens, this isn't it. It's mostly a loosely-strung collection of thought-provoking imagery."
5,Beautiful Film,"I liked _George Washington_. It is a beautiful film that follows a group of adolescent children one summer in North Carolina. The languorous mood, and gorgeous cinematography, along with the non-professional cast, creates a sense of pathos in the viewer. I wish more movies of this caliber were made."
1,It's Difficult To Explain Just How Bad This Is,"The most striking thing about George Washington is the incredibly unrealistic dialogue of the children. The funniest thing is that I later read the director say he was seeking realism. I would strongly warn against anyone considering buying this without having seen it first. I was also thinking of this after reading a review that favorably compared the film's narrative to that of Harmony Korine's Gummo, which I like very much. That's all I really wanted to point out. As well, I'll just say that the reviewer who posted the 'myths debunked' review is, if not involved in the production of the film, in some way profiting from the sales of it. All the others who have posted five-star reviews can just be put down to poor taste (click more about each one and see five stars given to a 98 Degrees album and similar products)."
3,UNITED WORLD OF DANCE:TECHNO,"Overall this album was good enough to buy.Some of the tracks like 1 and 3 were awesome as others were lame,I won't mention any though.Just buy it from Amazon and listen to it yourself to see if you like it."
5,Good Mud Flaps for the price,"I could not find any mud flaps for my truck that were normal, you know not the Yosemite Sam ones or the ones that say BACK OFF LOL. I just wanted normal black mud flaps and these were the best I could find. I originally spotted them at a local 4x4 shop near me and they were very expensive so I checked Amazon. Sure enough they were less then half the price. They were simple to put on and look nice. I would recommend them to anyone. I have had them on for about a month now."
2,Anchor bolt review,"Bolts arrived in a timely manner and as described. The bolts/ nuts did not easily screw together- over galvanized or poor thread cutting. In order to thread the nuts it required placing the bolts in a vise and then using a wrench with significant force seat them. This was required on almost the entire order- 100 bolts, very time consuming. The price was satisfactory. Would I order this product again??"
4,Good Stuff,"If for nothing else, buy this for the last couple of tracks which are Al ""Blind Owl"" Wilson's last recordings before his untimely death. Bob Hite and the others are also in fine form. Good, pure boogie and blues. A welcome relief from the slick, over produced schlock we hear dominating the airwaves today.This cd is fun. Bob Hite, Henry Vestine, Alan Wilson, de la Parra and Taylor, were/are talents that have received very little rcognition. All were.are great in what they do/did. Hite was realy a joy to listen to. He seemed to truly love what he was doing. But, so did the rest of the boys. Too bad they couldn't have gotten their personal lives under control and thus lived a little longer giving us the benefit of more of their work. Get this one and have fun!"
2,blind owls last performance,this cd is worth buying for one reason...it's the last recordings of blind owl.....the rest of the cd sounds like a bar band you could hear anywhere.....if it werent for the songs with the original band & blind owl....this would be total trash
5,Great Mario Bava Movie....................,This is a godd mario Bava Movie to those who appreciate good old fashioned Italian Horror...........I highly recommend this Movie. For those who like modern Horror Movies with Blood and Guts.... Stay Away By All Means..........
1,Not supposed to be a tragedy. BUT IT IS!,"Dreadful, shoddilly produced yarn about a woman travelling in Europe (Elke Sommer) who is spooked by a bald, lolly-pop sucking man (Telly Savalas) she constantly sees around town. After some car trouble she is forced to spend a night in a spooky castle where it turns out he's the butler (or something). The rest is just standard, forgettable European gothic-horror blah. Save yourself nine bucks and an hour and a half of your life by forgetting it before rather than after!"
3,seal,didnt use this seal. looked like it might have worked but i went with a neoprene seal instead. may have worked but i needed to be sure the first time.
2,Not as good as first thought,"I had quite a difficult time finding the correct gasket for the odd, wall-mounted toilet in basement. This one fit like a charm.This appeared to be a well manufactured gasket and arrived quickly and was undamaged. That it arrived quickly and in good shape is just as important as it being well made to start with. Replacing it is a stinky job that you do not want to have to redo. So get it done right the first time with a good quality gasket.Update: I reduced this rating from 4 to 2 stars as I just had to do this repair again because a leak developed. This is not the type of repair you want to do over.It turns out wax rings are not a good idea for wall-mounted toilets. After consulting a professional, I can only recommend using foam gaskets for wall mounted units. Wax is fine for floor mounts where gravity works to help the seal. On a wall mounted unit, not so much. The flexibility and bounce back of a foam gasket creates a much better seal."
2,Elementary School Book,This book is organized and illustrated as if elementary students were going to use it. But it is not a textbook. I was hoping more for something practical and applicable to young adult education.
5,Best Self-help I've ever read (especially being the first),"I read this book several years ago, and it changed my life. Laugh if you must, but as a teen and early adulthood, I truly felt that it was my God-given 'gift' to always take charge and always correct people when they were in the wrong (according to my standards). This book helped me not only to recognize my mistakes, but to see where I had gone wrong, the models I had followed in my life that were wrong, and how to let go of the need to 'Control' everything. There were so many 'aha' moments in this book, and I still have it and reference it, especially since I now have children of my own, and I find myself giving them 'the look'."
4,Deep Yet Truthful,"Sometimes what is the most controversial in our minds, is the thing we need to deal with the most. Being in control means things get done, we're never let down, and life will run smoothly...or so we think. Taking control over the lives of others can cause deep stress, physical and mental problems, and division in the household and relationships. This book helps you understand why you do what you do, and allows you to make your own, informed decisions on how to break free from the ""control trap."""
1,The Control Trap,"This was the worst book that I have ever read. The book being very irrevlant to most women. I would liked to have known that it was written by a women who states statistics without facts to back it up. This book only proves that stereotyping women by gender, income or race is still acceptable."
1,Not for Everyone,"I would have appreciated knowing that this book was centered around a focus on Christianity and ""family values"". I assumed this was a self-help book. The author is a pastor's wife in a Christian community that understands feminism as aggressive and castrating! The book is geared towards helping women be good wives and mothers, including weight loss. The implicit values make it a narrow resource for me. I found it to be very supportive of roles rather than people.I had hoped to learn more about being driven or controlled by anxiety, etc. as I live with perrenial stressors, such as the murder of a grown daughter. This was not the book for me and I regret buying it.Please let us know if a book is Christian focused or is written for members of a specific religous orientation!!"
3,Better Than Nothing,"Marva Whitney recorded some of the funkiest and soulful tracks ever recorded by the James Brown machine. It is too bad that Polygram has made them unavailable on CD.Soul Brothers Records of England put this record out. While I commend them for their effort to make this music available, the remastering job reveals the use of phonograph records. They got careless in the process leaving some tracks with noisy phonograph clicks and pops.(an audiophiles nightmare) The selection of tracks is excellent and some tracks such as ""It's My Thing"" and ""I Made A Mistake"" are remastered very well where rare recordings like the duet ""Sunny"" are scratchy and unnerving.If You are a Marva Whitney Fan like me, you will probably buy this record. Audiophiles, Stay clear of this record."
5,"Supply Chain Architecture: A Blueprint for Networking the Flow of Material, Information, and Cash","This book provides a meaningful, comprehesive, and entertaining picture of the global supply chain. Through stories, Bill has effectively taken potentially dry material and brought it to life in a meaningful and helpful way. Additionally, it is a great source of reference in the research arena.Jane BiddleVP Manufacturing ResearchAberdeen Group"
2,Don't Come Back,"There are so many people that would just about try to prove that they could definitely be great singers, they just don't have that feeling of making it happen. That is unfortunately the case with Vanessa Hudgens from the movie High School Musical. Although her star is risen, her feeling of music is more like a pop tart, than a definitive performer. Her debut single, Come Back To me, which samples the classic 70's song Baby Come Back, doesn't have a distinction of really standing out as a good song. I really wasn't impressed with the song at all, when I heard it on the radio. All in all, I hope her next song tries to be better than this one.Song: D 1/2-"
1,Come Back To Me ?,"Vanessa really got the beat going in high school musical . But now that's she a solo Um ??? I am not very impressed with her new solo . Although she has close ups on her looks i do not think people are looking enough at her music . I do not like her voice now . She must be overseeing herself as ""I can do High School Musical so I can be my own solo"" . So now we can come back to loving you ? Um NO! Every time me and my brother hear her song "" Say OK "" we block out her sound by saying "" Do Do Do Do Do... ."
2,Vanilla. Much.,"With all the ""hot rubber"" this and ""fire in a tyre factory"" the other, I was expecting Keanu Reeves to roll up in his biker gear. Instead, it was more like a schoolgirl with a My Little Pony eraser. This is more vanilla than a white suburban family watching re-runs of Valerie.Men wear this? Sure, why not!"
2,Smells Like the City,"Thats what it claims and it's true. It smells like you just got off of a motorcycle. I suppose that's sexy for men, and maybe some women, too. I prefer something more feminine. I LOVE the other Bvlgari women's scents."
5,...,"This is an intimate, special occasion cologne. Beware, if you spray too much, you'll smell like rubber. Even though this is not good for physical activities, I wore this to work a couple times and got nothing but complements and curiosity from my lady co-workers. It claims to be a day time cologne, but I think it's more of a night time/date cologne. It may seem very feminine when you smell it from the spray hole or on paper, but when it mixes with a mans natural oder, it becomes masculine, and for women, it becomes feminine. I find that I can use it all year round."
5,Explosion at the canecao,"1975 found Chico and Bethania working together on stage for the first time.This happened at the nightclub Canecao in Rio's Botafogo neighborhood.Response was so overwhelming that the weeekend shows were sold out for over six months. This amazing album was the child of this tournee which showcased Chico's songwriting and Bethania's singing and unusually dramatic performance .""Ole Ola"",""Sinal Fechado"",""Foi Assim"" became classics as a result.The first single ""Vai levando"" became a Top Ten with a bullet upon release and the album reigned atop the Hot 100 Brasil chart for over four months.Not bad for a first time collaboration.But again,Chico Buarque has been polled to be the Artist of the Century in his country.Bethania,likewise,is considered the Queen of Romantic Song and the first female singer to have a million selling album later in 1978.This is a gem!"
5,An excellent Brazilian pop album.,This is a great live collaboration between two of Brazil's biggest pop stars. Originally released in 1975.
1,THESE EARPHONES ARE HORRIBLE,"I was fooled by the other good reviews. the sound quality is horrible, the earphones are uncomfortable, and the traveling case is inconvenient. i would recommend NOT BUYING them."
2,Sound Great But Only in 2-3 Minute Intervals,"These sound great, the in-cord volume control is nice but these buds don't go *in* the ear and subsequently fall out every 2-3 minutes. And because they don't go in the ear, they don't block out outside noise. I had to max out the volume on my Zen Vision:M at a coffee shop just to hear my music, figured I was destroying my ear drums. I will try the Sony 51's next."
5,Excellent value,"I've used Sony earbuds for several years and have always been happy with them. I've had a pair of MDR-E829V earbuds for a few weeks and use them every day. They were very inexpensive and sound great!The volume control is unbelievably small, yet usable, and is a huge convenience.I've never had any trouble with failures on any of my Sony earbuds."
2,the earbuds were too big for my ear,"The earbuds hurt the inside of my ear when i used them on the plane, but if you have big ears (and i thought i did) then it would work for you. the volume control was nice and the case was handy too, but i had to buy new headphones in the airport because i knew i couldn't deal with that on my international flight."
3,Music to my ears,"I have been searching for earbuds with volume control sound is not as loud as pervious jvc brand, but they work well enough."
3,They Work,They sound okay too I suppose. They're rather flimsy though and it doesn't seem like much thought nor effort went into the quality and design of these which surprised me since they're SONY branded. I won't buy these again. Shipping and delivery was what would normally be expected of Amazon -- prompt.
2,Sony retractable earbuds,The earbuds retract in an external case and do not retract easily. It is not very useful and did not seem to work with the iPhone on the 1 time I tried it.
4,Audio for travel,"I bought the Sony MDR-E829V earbuds to replace old some old cheapy one, and The Sony earbuds were 200 times better than the ones I had before and was worth price, and if these could last longer than a couple of years I will be a customer for life because I use these headphones with my I-pod which I use when I travel to work or fun, everyday."
1,sharp pain,I can't keep them in my ears for more then 3-4 minutes. After that my ears are in real pain and I have to take the headphones out. My wife has the same problem. Might be ok for people with very very big ears.
1,Boo.,"Two problems:1) They don't stay in the ear particularly well. This is typical of earbuds, however.2) The plastic which covers the driver came off! Pressure on it the wrong way (ie trying to take them out of a full bag, normal use etc) makes it come off. And then you have a useless set of headphones..."
5,great headphones at a great price,"having previously owned a pair of panasonic earbuds that had nasty, rumbly bass, these headphones were a joy. They have good, powerful bass that at the same time doesn't drown out the treble, and they have a great range. i have yet to hear any music that these headphones distort in any way. and as usual with sony, they look pretty stylish as well. basically, these headphones are as good as it gets at this price."
4,Great sound,"I am really pleased with these great little ear buds. They fit comfortably into my ears and sound great. There is a supplemental volume control on the cord which helps adjust volume on the fly. I have used them with my MP3 player listening to both music and spoken word offerings. I have also used them on my laptop to watch a movie. Versatile could well be their middle name.To get a Sony brand set of ear buds at this price... You just can't go wrong. And when you're done, they wind neatly into their case for storage in your laptop case or gym bag. I'm quite happy with this purchase."
2,Good Sound while they Work,I purchased these in late December and they lasted less than two weeks. One of the earpieces does not work any more. They did sound good when they did work.
1,Not so good!!!,"If you need these earphones to work out, then DO NOT get these. I needed a pair quickly, so I picked these up for $15. The cord is way too long. They do not have a clamp on them, so I spend my whole workout trying to make sure they don't fall out of my ears. I had a cheap pair of Emerge retractable earbuds before this. I miss them so much that I just purchased another pair. They clamp to the back of my shirt and they stay in my ears perfectly. They are not the best sound, but they were comprable to these. One of the wires eventually went out, but they are perfect for working out and the price.As far as being a retractable earphone...the case is way too big. If you want to walk around carrying the winding case everywhere, be my guest. These are terrible for what I need them for. If you plan on sitting and doing nothing, then maybe you will love them. I unfortunately just waisted $17.00. Blah!!!"
3,Hope you have big ear holes!,"The sound is as good as any pair of headphones, but they keep falling out. I'm not sure if it's becasue being a female my ear holes are small, but they just won't stay put comfortably."
2,This did not work as well as I wanted.,"It seemed so compact and useable and Iliked the idea of the volume control.I found it was too annoying and I did not hearwell with it. Not sure if it was just me, but findI am not using it and tend to use just regularsmall ear phones that fit well in my pocket."
2,Good sounding but Uncomfortable,"Due to the design of these earbuds they fit in your ears uncomfortably. The bass is good, thats the only reason for 2 stars. Even treating the earbuds with care (running the cable down the INSIDE of my shirt so as to make sure that the cord doesn't get snagged on anything) ,The left earbud stopped working in less than 1 month. Buyer Beware."
1,Dead on arrival,"I've had a half-dozen of these over the past 10 years, and the quality is definitely going downhill. This pair arrived with a terrible scratching noise anytime the cord is moved. Clearly a bad connection in the right-angle connector at the end.Considering the price I paid and the return shipping costs, it's not worth the hassle to return them.Wasted money.Never again."
3,Disappointed,I had a very difficult time keeping the earbuds in my ears. My ear openings aren't that small. I'd say they're average in size and these earbuds kept falling out. Could be because they're flat rather than being cone shaped or having different sizes to fit the different size ears. I just found them difficult to use. The best thing I liked about them is the in-line volume control.
5,Great Headphones!,I think these headphones are worth the price. I used these to replace my Creative Lab Nomad Zen Xtra headphones that came free with the unit. Sounds much better...I can hear stuff before that I couldn't with my freebie headphones. No complaints so far.
4,Sony Earbuds Review,I ordered the merchandise and received it in a very timely manner.The packaging was great and the product is excellent as far asserving my purpose for quiet listening as needed on an airplane.Top quality and very pleased with product.Thanks
2,Big Ear Buds,I saw the other reivews about the buds being big and I did not believe them. I have an old pair of Sony ear buds and those fit great. These were much bigger. I don't like these but not worth the trouble to send them back. I should have listened to the other reviewers!
3,"Great sound, but not a perfect fit for users will small ears.","I'm currently wearing these headphones and they are definitely too big for my ears. After 20 minutes, my ears start hurting and I have to pop them out. I don't think I can continue to use them. Sound quality is very nice for headphones of this price range. The volume control is not bad, but just so there's no confusion to potential buyers, the lowest volume setting doesn't mute the sound. It's just a lower volume. It also seems like it'd be hard to turn the volume dial while running.If you're willing to sacrifice a bit of bass, I highly suggest the MDR-E10LP as an alternative. It's very very comfortable and perfect for running, working out and long periods of wear. It does, however, lack dedicated volume controls and is a bit less resilient it terms of structural quality. The MDR-E829V seems like it can definitely take a few drops and tugs, but you'll have to be a little more careful with the MDR-E10LP.Hope this review helps."
1,Piece of Junk... only one earphone works after 3 months,Sony has phoned this one in... This is the second pair I have owned. I am an adult male that does not abuse the head phones so I am very disappointed that both pairs went bad in less than 6 months. Wiring is miserable and breaks somewhere inside. It is not repairable.I bought them because of the volume control and travel case. They are garbage.
1,Very short shelf life,"I bought these less than two weeks ago, and they've already crapped out on the right headphone. This is the third time I've bought this brand of headphone, and the third time the right earbud has crapped out after only a short amount of moderate use.If you want headphones that last, don't buy these. It's just frustrating."
1,If only they didn't die so quickly...,"I've been using this model for years, but recently it seems like the build quality has gone way down. 4 pairs have died on me in the last two years. The most recent one died after less than 2 months of use. In all cases, one of the ears stops producing sound. Too bad because otherwise I really liked these earphones."
4,great sound,"Sounds way better than the original ear phones that come with the IPod, but not as snug on the ear."
5,Excellent earbuds for the price,"Ideally you'll want the noise-cancelling earbuds to cancel out the noise from the telescreen at the gym, but if can't afford $200, these earbuds are very good. The plastic covering the wires is excellent and does not look like it can work itself loose (unlike the iPod's earbuds)."
2,"Okay, but not great","I thought by looking at the picture this was like a retractable cord that would pull out when you wanted to use the earphones and then retract when not in use, but no.....you have to manually wind and it doesn't work that great!"
1,How irritating!,"These are not designed to fit in the ear canal. I have to jam them/screw them in at an angle to make them stay. Still they try to fall out and are very uncomfortable if they do stay in. The sound is OK, but they're so irritating that I can't even enjoy the sound. Also, I got them to listen to lectures, etc. online and the cord is so short that I have to sit uncomfortably close to the monitor. This was not a good purchase for me. I'm going to have to start over."
1,Headphones,"Did not like this product. ear buds are big, no cushions and hard to keep in your ears. Would not buy this again."
1,Disappointed,Great price...worked well the first day...BUT one of the earplugs stopped working on day 2.
1,clang,"hmmm, where to begin...I purchased an Mpio mp3 player (Mpio fl100 - a cracker), Amazon reviews advised the dumping of the factory ear buds for this model Sony, hear more bass, improved range, natter natter...Made the purchase and shot home for the comparison...drum roll please...Aero smiths ""I don't want to miss a thing - Armageddon theme"", was sampled with both. The sonys failed to adequately pick up the three settle tin drum beats through the intro, nor the strumming of the Spanish guitar as the tune picks up. I only realized they were there when I plugged the mpio's back in. Again the suttle strings that complete the song are incredibly out of these buds range.There is more bass, but muffled, it sounds like a canvass veil had been pulled over the whole music spectrum - if you want to hear the entire engineering that has been mixed into a song, you will not get it with these dud buds.They promised so much, but could not better a factory set from an MP3 manufacturer?Try something else."
3,Elvis Exploitation,"This collection combines a few early Elvis live recordings (that are in the public domian and are available on other CDs) with studio recordings of other artists from the 1950s. Nothing new or rare in this set. Just an attempt to exploit Elvis' popularity and sell a CD by repackaging previously released material. I recommend that you pass on this and get one of the early Elvis live collections that includes these performances (like the ""That's All Right"" CD) instead."
4,One of 2012's best!,"This is easily one of the best action movies of 2012! Jay Chou is a bad ass, Nicholas Tse is a bad ass and Andy On is becoming one of the best villains in Hong Kong cinema. Shot in some beautiful locations, this is right up there in terms of Dante Lam's best works yet!"
4,Heavy but functional.,"I wish it were lighter and had smoother edges as iI travel with it , but it is accurate for my purpose."
3,Come to Me is SO much better!,I loved Come to Me by Lisa Cach and was disappointed by this novel. It wasn't terrible but compared to Samira's story it was definitely lacking in my opinion. The chemistry just wasn't that strong and the ending was disappointing.
3,Dream Of Me,"His deal with Vlad will give Theron access to a treasure he could only dream of, Lucia, a beautiful princess kept sheltered in a tower by her domineering brother. She is so innocent that she does not even understand what she wants, but Theron, an incubus, knows, for he has given her desires. Now, in control of Vlad's body, he will give her everything that he wants. The main problem in their way is himself. For he does not have a body of his own, but must rely on the cooperation of his host. Lucia makes him want not just to be a better man, but to be one.*** In the prior book to this, ""Come to Me"", Theron was the villain. Now, he is the opposite, but still very bad. Even Lucia's love can not totally reform him, as will be proved on the last page. This is the ultimate Gothic novel. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
2,"Sloppy, Uninspired and somebody please turn Glen's mic off!","""Burn"" and ""Stormbringer"" are my 2 favorite DP albums, but this cd is weak. Most of the problems lie in the vocal performance. Coverdale's cracking and Hughes' caterwalling make it almost unforgivable. The ending of Mistreated (both times) is so bad, it will make your teeth rattle. I give it 2 stars only because of the great guitar work by Blackmore. It's best to stick to the studio albums, if you like Blackmore's live playing check out Rainbow On Stage.....much better!!"
4,On a Par with Koyanasqatsi,"VERY moving AND very disturbing presentation of a classic and very complex piece of music which does it proper justice in a way that typical Christmastime religious presentations of the work do not.I saw this on the big screen in Columbia, SC on Good Friday with the concertmaster of the South Carolina Philharmonic. The performances are a mixed bag, with some top notch world class and some amateurish but moving. It shows the nuttiness of American holy-roller megachurch religion silently and without comment juxtaposed on Handel's score.People who take all the religious bull$#!+ seriously AND don't have a very high I.Q. will be highly offended. Those religious people who are not complete morons will really like this film and find that it adds depth to their faith.In either case, it's better than 'Avatar.'"
2,Found it Cheaper,"I just love this 6 Piece bedding set and all the assessories you can buy as well. However, I found a site that is MUCH cheaper. I bought the set from www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com. Here are the price differences:6 piece crib set burlington (BLT) 144.46 vs. BRU 179.99,lamp base and lamp shade together for BLT 33.96 vs BRU 49.98,extra window valance BLT 16.96 vs. BRU 19.99,growth chart BLT 16.99 vs. BRU 19.99,5 piece wall hanging set BLT 21.21 vs. BRU 24.99,picture frame BLT 11.04 vs. BRU 12.99,night light BLT 8.49 vs BRU 12.99,barnyard switch plate BLT 8.49 vs BRU 9.99,mobile BLT 33.96 vs. 39.99.I think I have made my point. Just with what I have listed I am going to save $75.34. Hope I have helped you save some money too!"
2,Cute but......,Jc Penney carries more of the barnyard accesories than Babies R Us does. They have the 3pc. comforter for 129.99 and babies R Us wants 179.99. The when you buy the lamp at babies r us its 34.99 but you have to buy the lamp shade extra and its 14.99. So far on just two items I have found that you can SAVE about $60. Although I don't really recomend registering at Jcpenney. We did but just for our bedding. Theyre baby gear selection I would give a one star because they don't carry that much.Barnyard was our boy theme and we found we are expecting a girl so we went with Isabella which just happens to be her name.
1,CAUTION,"This mobile was a great purchase - my son loved it! However, the warning only states that the risk if stangulation is possible if not taken down when babies are able to get up on all fours. My son was not on all fours yet but managed to pull the mobile down into his crib. The problem was that the pin that connects the mobile to the music box came out. This is a 2 inch metal PIN that was sticking straight up at my son's face when I walked into his room. Fortunately - he was not injured but he could have lost an eye or pierced his skin. Just be cautious!"
2,does not fit every crib,"I wasn't aware that some mobiles don't fit all cribs. We have a conversion crib and when we got the mobile, the bars were too wide for it to fit on. Now we're trying to look for something that will fit. Very cute mobile though, I just wish it would fit."
3,very cute......but......,"short? I mean it hangs really close to the crib. Jack is 7 weeks and we have yet to use his crib, but its really low down. Like the blue bendy neck thingy is too short. It is really cute though."
3,So disappointed!,We chose Barnyard for our first son and it is adorable! But we purchased this mobile to go with the room and it does not fit our crib. We have the Emily convertible crib and the slats on the sides are too big. So b/f you spend $40 on a mobile make sure your slats are not 3 inches wide. Everyone else should dig it cause it's so cute!
5,Rare clips of numerous stars.,"This tape include just over 1 hour of rare short clips of several stars, most very funny, some rarely even seen on television, like Henny Youngman and Joe E. Lewis. Near the end is an extended sequence from a Friars club dinner honoring Ed Sullivan, which includes banter between Jack Carson, Jack E. Leonard, Walter Cronkite, and Morey Amsterdam. Others featured on the tape include Victor Borge, Buddy Hackett, Phyllis Diller, Alan King, Jackie Mason, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Joan Rivers, Joe E. Lewis, Danny Thomas, The Smothers Brothers, Dan Rowan and Dick Martin (of Laugh-in), and others."
5,Extraordinario Album (infaltable en una colección),"Creo que Sandra es una de las mejores cantantes de los ultimos años de la musica pop, avalada y producida por su esposo Michael Cretu, han creado albumes muy particulares que con la musica te invita a soñar con cada tema. Aquel que nunca escucho a Sandra , es decir que no la conoció por ser el interprete de tal tema le falta un poco mas de cultura musical. Sigue siendo y seguira siendo una de las mejores vocalistas del mundo, capaz de hacerte soñar, vibrar y conocer la calidad de la musica que muchos no saben aprovechar. Sin duda una vez que la escuches pasa a ser parte de tu vida sobretodo en los mejores momentos.Definitivamente la mas hermosa cantante que ha existido en todos los tiempos casi una artista integral."
5,A really good singles collection from Sandra,"This is one of the most relevant albums from Sandra. It contains all the most succesfull hits from the 80's era of Sandra's music, including megahits like ""María Magdalena"", and ""In the Heat of the Night"". A basic album that any Sandra's music lover should have.Another remarcable thing is the inside brochure, it contains commentaries written by Sandra for each song included.The quality of the tracks is perfect, the voice of Sandra is lovely, and the music is legendary.As i said before, this is an album that any fan should have. Notice that this material is more than 20 year old, so is really good that they keep it on sales! Thanks very much Sandra and Amazon.com!"
4,Fry Pan,The Farberware Stainless Steel Skillet is the greatest fry pan I've used in a long time. It fries up Fried Chicken to a chrisp and great taste. So much better than teflon which won't chrisp up what you fry like this fry pan will. Easy to clean and mantain.
2,very disappointing,"The Farberware electric skillet doesn't heat reliably or evenly and the design of the controls makes it hard to read the temperature. I have to keep turning the temperature setting higher and higher to get it to heat, making the lower temperature settings useless. There is also an unpleasant smell that the skillet produces when it is on (no, it is not coming from the food I'm trying to cook). The bottom of the stainless steel pan is etched with a lot of circular lines which makes it harder to clean than smooth-bottom stainless pans. I don't like the way it sits up on high legs--seems unstable."
1,This movie was not a good movie at all!,This was not a good horror movie. This movie really sucked! There was no gore in this movie. This was the sorriest movie I ever seen!
4,nice,i like the fact i was able to replace my lost cd. listening to this brings back good old memories
5,Classic adventure travels,"Saw this when it appeared on PBS back in the 1980s and later read the companion book. Loved both, mainly for the style of narration used and the sense of real adventure these works managed to preserve. The film stock is pretty rough by today's standards, but time changes everything and these capture the zeitgeist of their time and place -- and such exotic places! I wish Lorne Blair would hurry up and reincarnate.I also wish National Geographic would get around to republishing ""Bali: masterpiece of the Gods"" on DVD..."
4,The Story continues,"Incidental things that I didn't know about the scrolls, comparisons to ancient texts, players in the discovery and transcription... it's all here and laid out in a comprehensive, well thought out form. Easy to read and absorb."
1,WTF....,"Within 2 minutes my clothes went from ""color run"" to ""colorless""! My Khaki pants turned light pink, blue/light blue shirt to violet & brown. Took stain and almost all color completely out of clothes. Probably works good for whites. Overall - SUCKS!!!"
1,"Carbona Color Run Remover,",This product no only took the color run out - it took the color totally out of the clothes. Light blue shirt turned white medium blue shirt turned gray. Will never use again.
1,Incomplete product,"This book's examples and problem sets require software and data sets that are supposed to be contained in a CD attached to the back cover. However, the book I received has no CD attached. Amazon.com does not provide a phone number (or at least is is very obscure, since I have not yet found one) in order to resolve the problem. Frustrating!"
4,Camcorder AV Cord,Lost my previous cord that attaches from camcorder to tv. The cord does the job perfectly...wish it could have an hdmi hookup instead of rca cables.
1,S video cable works only 1-way,"I bought it specifically to dub my Sony Hi8 tapes to PC in AVI foramt, through my Sony DV camcorder and docking station. Unfortunately, the S video cable is defective although the yellow video cable works. Strangely enough, Sony A/V -> S video still works. The reverse (i.e., S video -> Sony A/V) doesn't.I am returning it for an exchange and will update this review in a week or two."
2,Nice quality,"It probably works great for it's intended purpose. I was hoping to use it to connect an HTC EVO to an older television. Unfortunately Sony uses a ""Modified"" form micro HDMI which is incompatible with the standard micro HDMI that HTC uses."
4,great cable for recording your home movies,"I generally use this to record videos and it has a ""S"" video input into the recorder which is the best video picture you can get in the analog style cables."
4,works well,"I purchased item to replace one I thought I lost.The day it arrived, I found my old one. So now I have a spare."
4,Good but not her best!,This book it about a girl and her best friend. Her best friend gets a boyfriend and so she thinks she needs on. There is a boy however who likes her. They start to go out. She finds out that she doesn't want to be around him ALL the time. She also learns that their is a cost for having a boyfriend. In all of this is another little girl. As i said before this is not the best of Cooney's work but it is a good book to read. It gives a real life feeling of what it is like.
4,A Teen Love Story Gone Wrong,In this book a girl and her best friend are hopeless romantics. They finally get boyfriends and one finds out that it is not all it's cut out to be. She and her boyfriend like each other but they don't want to be like her friend and her boyfriend. The try and be like them and find it dosen't work because they both want to lead their own life out side of their relationship. The story tells of the hardship and expectations of relationships.
4,Little Jade,Very Helpful! If you don't understand how kids think in your divorce. This is a great book for you to understand and answer their questions!
2,Not for average person,"My wife purchased this book in hopes that I would be able to do some simple adjustments to her banjo. I am generally able to tackle any handyman task but I found this book to be written to the expert. Be advised it is not helpful to the average person wishing to do simple things like change strings, adjust the banjo head etc."
3,"Life is long, take care of what you leave for life to care for","This is a quick gentle read. Yet it questions the mark youthful behavior leaves on folks in the following decades. The characters claim their here and now, but act out of their long ago and far away. And their their plans run amok, as human plans our do. So clearing up this mess invites us all to take more responsibility for the lives we live today in the hope that seven generations will not feel pain at our behaviors."
5,A dandy little plug.,"I used this plug to replace one that I ruined when I tried to reshape the side contacts, which were rounded, and kept popping out of my lighter socket. This one has different shaped side contacts, and stays plugged in much better. To install, you need to unscrew the chrome fixture on the end, an aspect that may not be obvious when you get the thing. You will need to solder your wires, as this does not come with screw contacts. It's a little tricky, and you may have to support your work, but you can do it if you are careful. Be aware that this plug comes with a fuse that may be too small for your aplication : I had to replace mine with one of a higher amperage rating. The LED is a nice feature as it lets you know that you are indeed getting voltage to the plug."
5,"good quality plug, used to replace broken plug on marine radio","I bought a cobra marine radio a while ago and the plug completely fell apart after using for a few months. Contact manufacturer and pay $20 for a replacement plug of the same poor quality? I think not... I ordered this plug and the repair was quick and easy. I recommend wrapping some electrical tape around the wire you pull through the rubber flexible piece to make sure it's snug. Also, tie a knot on the inside of the plug so that the wires won't come out if you accidentally pull on them too hard. Soldering is pretty straightforward, just make sure not to mess up polarity"
5,Master Serie: Daniel Guichard,You will be astonished by Daniel Guichard's deep and romantic voice. It carries a wonderful warmth and strength. I can't wait for a more recent album to come out in the US because his voice is even better now (I saw him on stage in France a couple years ago).
4,Gil's opinion,"I'm pleased with the recorder & had no problems or questions until today. The picture showing ""Item being reviewed"" shows the recorder & several (3 it appears) micro cassettes. I only received 1 30 minute tape. Should I have gotten more or is the picture incorrect?"
2,"Good lighting, poor cutting","I really want to like this product, but it just does not cut as well as the Wahl trimmer I replaced. I like the light, and I like how it looks and fits in my hand, but I just don't feel that it cuts very well. I have to go over a spot several times to trim the same area that the (cheaper) Wahl could handle in one shot.Disappointed."
2,Uses more water than I expected,"I was hoping to use two of these inline with each other, but due to the amount of water pressure needed to power these, there was barely any spray (maybe 6 feet!)."
2,Not good,"This movie is dumb, but it's worth it just to see Tim Daly in his white undies. What a sight."
1,"Poor, bad, horrible, painful to watch, take a pick","A young doctor transforms into a psychotic woman on a regular basis. If this plotline excites you, than you might find something you like in this movie. I didn't. I actually found it to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Sean Young is a strong contender for being the most annoying actress there ever was, back to back with Melanie Griffith. This film is unfunny to the extreme and I strongly suggest that people beware of it."
4,A Truely moving and meaningful work of literary prose,"Nicolo's Gifts is one of the few contemporary books I have read that truely earns the title ""literature"". The characters are deep and multi-layered, and the motion of the book keeps you involved. Although the characters are difficult to get to know, this is sometimes a good thing, because the characters do not tell the story, the story unfolds itself. If you are like me and have been searching for a work of real 21st century literature, turn to Nicolo's gifts, you won't be dissappointed."
2,really boering,I was really dissapointed with this cd .Their northern exposur cd's is some of the best progressive trance mix out there.But it seemed they got the most boreing trance and mix it together .Trance has been getting a little boring now that every dj is trying to be progressive .Im tired of djs that are old enough to be my dad telling us how trance should sound
3,I really don't know what to think of this CD,"At first I LOVED CD1, then I hated it....Now it is slowly growing on me....At first I loved CD2, now my interest in it is quickly waning! But at the same time I still kind of like it....Strange....only a few other CD's have had that effect on me, and those are the ones that are in my closet collecting dust!"
2,yawn,"This album is a complete bore -- and a disappointment thanks to the other incredible albums Sasha and Digweed released this year (Expeditions, Northern Exposure, etc). ""Communicate"" doesn't communicate at all -- it seems more like the duo want to talk with a couple of tin cans and a string. There's nothing exceptional about this outing that allows it to stand out from the already overcrowded ""electronic"" market. If not for their relentless reputations this album would have been completely ignored -- which is exactly what I did after giving it one listen.Don't be fooled by the pervasive Sasha and Digweed myth. If you want to hear some great beats check out John Digweed's Global Underground in Hong Kong disc or Paul van Dyk's new ""Out There and Back""."
2,boring!,there are better cd's to get than this one. some songs are incredibly boring i want to shoot myself.
3,Quality disc but nothing special,"This is good trance, but the problem is there is just so much better out there. I was even tempted to give it 2 stars when compared to other Sasha and Digweed mixes and other trance mixes. I dont know why this CD doesn't do it for me. Ive listened to it like 10 times since getting it on the first day but nothing I hear ever makes me want to come back but every week I give it another try, but I see nothing special. Maybe this just isn't my style of trance. Im sure many will enjoy it more than i did. Northern Exposure is awesome and so are the Global Underground mixes. Sasha and Digweed r 2 of the best DJs are the planet but if u sometimes find there style a bit repetative and lacking in melodies check out Paul Oakenfold,DJ Tiesto and Paul Van Dyk. They are just as great but they put more emphasis on energy and melodies. Its possible if u have Sasha and Digweeds other stuff u'll enjoy this too, but if u dont have their other mixes get those instead."
4,sasha and digweed,"This is a pretty great cd. But, after you listened to most of digweed and sasha's work, you'll notice alot more of their better tracks.This is a pretty good cd, however sasha and digweed's Global Underground Albums are by far much more brilliant than this. Sasha and John Digweed's Ibiza albums are their best. But, don't take my word for it. See if you like it?"
5,"Hot,Hot,Hot,!","This music opens up a whole new sound. You can work with it, go to sleep with it,use it for background or whatever.This is the best sound to come along since theBeatles, I mean this is a real change in sound direction. Can't be beat ! Ya gotta love it..."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ Boring!,"After listening to Digweed's Bedrock or GU Hong Kong Album(s), 'Communicate' pails in comparison. It sounds rushed and poorly thought out and does not exemplify the talented duo of Sasha and John Digweed as the Northern Exposure CD's do. There are a few redeeming tracks, but not redeeming enough. Sorry Sasha and John, but you guys can do better."
4,Worth buying for Digweed's Masterful Mix,"After listening to disc one by Sasha, I was quite disappointed because it didn't live up Sasha's usual quality. But disc two by Digweed is some of the best mixing and track selection that I've heard so far. He stays away from anthems and creates a fantastic dancy vibe, although with his trademark darkness rather than Oakenfold-style cheese. Definitely get this if you liked Bedrock, or alternately if you like this disc, get Bedrock. I might also start to like the Sasha disc but at first listen it sounds boring and repetitive, not what I expect from Sasha, especially after his masterful Ibiza set. Regardless, at 14 bucks this is definitely worthwhile for Digweed's disc alone."
3,Not their best work,"If you're expeciting something as good as Expeditions, beware. Although both discs are good, there are better things out there to listen to.Sasha in Ibiza (Global Underground) is far better as well. I guess it is nice to hear some new songs, but Communicate seems uneventful. It wouldn't dissuade me from buying their future cd's though. Their style seemingly changes every couple of months/ releases, and they fluctuate between amazing and boring."
3,Champagne and Crap,"CD 1 is horrible. CD 2 is excellent. CD1 has horrible track selection, it just doesnt make any sense together, theres no cohesion at all. CD 2 has an excellent and consistent groove, with great tracks and great atmosphere. A real pitty you cant get CD2 on its own."
1,sasha fan from wayback,in my opinion this cd is pretty weak. i used to love sasha & digweed not only for their mixing skills but for their uncomparable record selection. i must say that i was very disappointed with this album. the mixing is still good but ever since the northern exposure series their taste in music has taken a turn (for the worse in my eyes). the music on this album is very repetitive for the most part and at least 2/3 of the songs have almost no energy. if you like the style and what not of northern exposure than i doubt you will enjoy this cd at all. but if you feel like taking a chance everybody has different tastes.
4,There's a time and place for this set.,"Sasha / Digweed the UK's trance superstar DJs come up with something a little different this time. I wouldn't so much consider this a continuation of the remarkable Northern Exposure series. Those titles in themselves opened up trance to new audiences and in turn really got the ball rolling on big name (DJ or Superclubs for that matter) mix albums along the lines of the popular Renaissance, Gatecrasher, Tranceport and Global Underground franchises. This would be great at a party at 6 or 7 in the morning, it's much darker music, you just want to hear pulsating rhythm without the uptempo beats as the strobe lights give way to kaleidescopes of hypnotic colours. It's a state of mind thing. Highlights include Breeders Tryratanic and of course the Orbs Once More. Once again Sasha and Digweed have each created sets that they can call their very own, two extremely cohesive 70 plus minutes of foot stomping at that. Recommended."
5,Blinding,"Out of all the sasha/digweed releases over the past 5 years this mix is the one that truely reflects the current style that they are playing. It is basically banging. Its hard, melodic, twisted and will leave you feeling like your stuck on the dancefloor of a dark sweaty nightclub at 3am. This is pure dancefloor fodder. Mix one seems like it reflects sashas style with a large emphasis on the slacker sound. The winners here are, Sven Vath and Trisco-Musak which brings a funky element to the mix. Disk two carries the momentum with some dark twisted floor destroyers. The orb's once more and jimmy van M rock this disk. Be aware that track number 8 is actually track number 9. This sleeve mess up is mearly a blip on an otherwise amazing mix which is the best I've heard in a long time. Buy it now."
5,.. :: Drool :: ..,"This album is incredible. Once again, Sasha & Digweed far surapss my standards. Working together, they plunge into the subconsious with seamlessly extended mixes. Sometimes it is impossible to tell where one tune ends and another begins. The album is not a compilation of trance anthems mixed together with a cross-fader, it can only be viewed as a whole. This album is far more than a simple mix, it is an experience. To truly feel the value of the album in its entirety, one must listen to it, as a whole, as a journey in which single tracks are poured into a die-cast mold of turntablistic perfection. Buy this, buy this and fade away into the depths of Sasha & Digweed's creation, Communicate..."
4,Who knew donuts could be so wild and fascinating?,"I heard about this book an an Aaron Horkey art gallery exhibit in the Cottonwood County Historical Society's Remick Art Gallery. How oddball is that? I was told that it was one of Mr. Horkey's early inspirations, and I can see why! Each page is worth hours of examination, full of stories and jokes and wild imagination. Even my one-year-old is captivated for minutes at a time (a HUGE compliment). I love this book, and can't believe I didn't discover it until my 30's."
4,"Shipped fast, good condition.","Bought this book for my boyfriend, who remembers it from childhood. The drawings are great; so intricate!"
5,awesome,This book is just brilliant. The illustrations are incredible. Kids just stare at the pages just to see the pictures. The message is one to take home as well. Highly recommended
4,It teaches children about money.,"The illlustrations are fun. The text talks about situations to which kids can relate. The book gives some good lessons about money and how to use it. Yet, the book never bogs down. Children find it interesting and fun."
3,Talks about saving money,If you made a Million is a book that talks about money and its value. It teaches about the bank and how to save your money. It also teaches that money is valuable.I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read about money. I also think it is a bit boring.
2,Too long & boring,"This novel was overly long. It could have done with considerably more editing. As someone else has said, the constant name dropping of various famous figures got rather tedious.He was recruited to Naval Intelligence by Ian Fleming, is best mates with Hemmingway, plays golf with the Duke of Windsor, and unwittingly gets recruited to the Baader-Meinhof Organisation...I ask you! I couldn't warm to any of the characters as they were all pretty selfish and morally corrupt..Mounstuart has an affair with one of his oldest friend's wives. I do not think I would read another novel by this author."
4,Any Human Heart,"I was not familiar with William Boyd's work and picked up this novel because it sounded intriguing. It is an exceptional book, managing to be at once a moving personal story, a brief (and often funny) history of the arts and politics of the 20th century, and an examination of a society in decline. The protagonist's meetings with historical characters, from Picasso and Hemingway to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, are surprisingly convincing and never seem like a ""gimic."" I found the second half of the book somewhat less convincing than the first, and I got rather tired of the hero's obsession with his [physical] life, but all in all--a great read. I will look for more William Boyd."
4,The curse of war,"Any Human Heart, a novel that is written as an autobiography that spans nearly 80 years in the life of Logan Mountstuart, is a hilarious and sophisticated piece of work. It gives us account's of his life from his years in an English prep school, his take on the British social system, his years at Oxford, his marriages, the curse of two wars and their effects on his life, certainly exacerbated by his imprisonment for 2 years during WWII. When he is released to return home - he finds everything changed: his family, his marriage, his country, and his world. Any Human Heart is a tale of lonliness, disappointment, and despair - yet it makes you laugh through your tears.Well worth the read, even tho it's 500 pages long."
2,"Left me ""restless""","I suspect my expectations are the problem here... because so many others seem to like this novel. But having read, and thoroughly enjoyed Boyd's ""Restless,"" and reading the good reviews on ""Any Human Heart,"" I purchased the psuedo- autobiography hoping to be equally enthralled. I found the format too choppy, and the more I learned about the main character, the less I cared about him and his future entries. So many historic names are dropped, and then the story lines involving them are also dropped, leaving the reader in limbo. Finally, about three-quarters of the way through this novel I started skimming ahead, learned how he died and finally, laid this novel to rest. I plan to try one of Boyd's other novels in hopes of finding another read as compelling as ""Restless."""
4,A fun break from the norm,"I found this book both fascinating and frustrating. Fascinating, as the life Mountstuart leads is exciting and unpredictable, yet frustrating as one cannot understand the motivation that lies behind the seemingly random events of the protagonist's life. This was an enjoyable read, though for completely different reasons than usual. Typically, I love to read about the inner workings and motivations that lie behind the actions of the main character, yet here the reader is left somewhat bereft.I loved the simplicity with which Mountstuart views life, as a series of events that happen to him out of chance; yet at times I wanted to strangle him for lacking the ability to learn from past mistakes and never having the foresight to plot any sort of future for himself.This was a fun break from the norm. Mogadishu."
2,"""But can he do this?""","This endless, wordy, shapeless book bewilders me. How can Time magazine call it the best of the year? It seems to me to be the product of the author wondering if he thread a fictional narrative through the likes of Hemingway, various royalty, and Picasso, and -- if he does -- if anyone will even stay with him. It must be men who like this book. Perhaps his previous reputation bought him boundless credibility. I felt roundly ripped off."
5,Magnificent,"This novel is a tour de force, a masterpiece not only of literature but an honest and astute observation of a man's life over the 20th century. It is beautifully written, and there are times when you will be wondering if this is not some sort of autobiography, sensitively edited by friends and colleagues, complete with footnotes and additional explanations. It is very, very clever.But in the midst of all this clever writing there is a very honest and heartfelt story, of a man who marries becuase its expected of him, and then throws it all away for love; who lives through the horror of war and loses what is important to him. It is a charming portrait of youth, and an honest portrait of old age. It is utterly wonderful.It isn't always an easy read, but it is a unique snapshot of a life, beautifully spun out and presented, and I highly recommend it."
2,As depressing as it gets - the French movie par excellence,"Being very familiar with where it takes place, and having experienced first hand the terrible French economic depression (depression in general) of the early nineties, I cannot but somewhat relate to the story, and the overall effect of that movie is totally depressing. That may be very well acted and very realistic, I still regret having forked out 55 francs when it came out to feel bad the rest of the evening. But if that's your trip, I also advise Rosetta, and Hate (La haine) (which I love however - the Paris suburbs like if you were living there)"
5,life and its lessons,"This film about the lives of two women and their friendship is poignant and riveting. The acting, by Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier is extraordinary and at times one feels these are not characters but real people. This winner of many awards is filmed beautifully with patches of brilliant color and is a stunning debut by writer/director Erick Zonca. This is not only about friendship but about self-destruction vs. the will to survive. Isa (Bouchez) has such a gentle but strong soul, and Marie (Regnier), is the violent but weak one. You won't forget this moving story of their lives."
5,an ultimate window to happenings in the current world,"Every book from Lieve Joris is an ultimate window in certain affairs of the current world, such as Hungaria, Zaire (yet known as the Republic of Congo), Mali, The Gulf States, Syria, Egypt etc. The words the writer chooses are dedicated to their subject. And Lieve Joris knows she is a subject too. This book about Damascus tells us about the innerlife of the innercity of Damascus. It is a story about the women in Damascus, the men, the politics, real life, the dreams of the past and the no-hopes of the future. This is how I see it. If you like newspapers and human interest in a journalistic way: try this book! (And all of her others aswell)"
4,A Cheery Romance,"Not everyone can agree what makes a book worth reading, and I have read enough Susan Sizemore to realize that not all her books are of the same caliber. Yet, while this one does have flaws, I believe it is a charming book that can delight other readers, as it did me. The book is filled with humor. The plot is interesting rather than gripping, but that is the nature of such a light and cheery tale."
2,"Had potential, but very shallow","I bought this book, similar to other reviewers here, based off previous customer reviews and was extremely disappointed. The story had potential and some fun ideas, but never quite fleshed them out completely or lived up to the expectation. First of all, the book is printed in extremely large type, which was very jarring...but it seems it was like writing a college paper - make the font bigger to make up for the lack of substance. Harriet and Martin are somewhat entertaining, but Martin especially becomes very unsympathetic and his actions through most of the book aren't consistent with the picture presented of him in flashbacks. The side characters pop in and out with very little development. It just isn't up to par with writers like Amanda Quick, Elizabeth Dodd, Julie Garwood and others. I'd love to see one of them take this idea and run with it!"
3,Another Try at Susan Sizemore,"This is the third Susan Sizemore book I've read and I still cannot rate it better than just a bit average. The blurb and Kindle sample always intrigues me and I end up buying the book and the beginning of the book would normally intrigue me. This has a similar style as Sizemore's Price of Innocence whereby the story goes back and forth to also tell the history of the characters at the first parts of the book.The book does hold my interest enough to see it through the end, but does not leave me impressed with the book. I did like many things about it still, such as the ineractions between the characters, despite Martin's seeming acts of revenge. Good chemistry and dialogue."
1,I Couldn't Have Been More Disappointed. Save Your Money.,"I bought this book on the strength of customer reviews and I really wanted to like it. What a disappointment. If we're meant to believe that Abigail/Harriet is a spy, then she is the dittsiest one I've ever heard of. She and her ""family of spies"" are ludicrously written. They talk about being spies like that...""oh yes...we're spies..."" Ick. There is very little plot here, even less character development, and neither the hero or the heroine are sketched out beyond the barest frames. Also, as far as romance/eroticism goes, there is no there, there. If you don't care about the main characters, then you don't really care about their lovemaking either. I think the author needs a better editor...one who can remind her over and over that the reader wants to be SHOWN, not told. This went into the trashcan, and I do hate having my money wasted. Also, beware of the back cover art. Very trashy."
1,Pointless,"I bought the port so I could have extra power sockets. With this product, only one power socket could be used. What's the point of that? You need to make the other three outlets available for use to serve its purpose. Then you can call it a 4 Outlet Power Socket. This product is not what it looks like. Don't be duped."
3,"Hard to say just yet, but so far a fuse eater.","I have used this port less than a month, with no more than two items plugged in at a time, and it burned through the first fuse on say the 4th or 5th time I used it in that short time. Based on that, I'm not happy with it so far."
5,anyone with multi devises need this and works well,this works well when yo have a car full of people or a camper full of people that need to recharge there devices
3,weak,never got to really use it as I blew the fuse in this immediately. I want stuff that works and you don't have to screw around to make it work because it's made like crap.
1,Melted,"Freaking awful. It was working great for the first two days, but the cheap plastic plug melted on me. the day it melted i was barely running anything on it either. GPS, Cig lighter, and a car charger for my gfs phone and a charger/fm transmitter for my phone. Don't buy this."
4,Good outlet,I am skeptical of cheap car adapters but I got this particular one b/c of the decent reviews and I must say it worked great with my car (but only tried with only two ports).
1,Garbage,"Thankfully this was an inexpensive item and Amazon has a great return policy.I plugged this item into my lighter socket. It worked perfectly. When I unplugged it, part of the plug became lodged in the lighter socket. Who designs something like that? It cost me over $35 to have a mechanic dislodge it and then find the fuse it blew. And Lenmar, the manufacturer, never responded to my website submission about their product. So all around, a great experience."
1,Complete Junk,"We purchased this device while on a trip. It worked at first. Later one of the four power take-offs failed. Then the connection to the car became flakey and you had to get it positioned just right. Finally, less than a year later and after only moderate use, the power plug has failed completely. Worse, the fit is so tight you have to hold the dash trim on the car when you try to pull the plug out for fear of ripping the dash right out of the car.Design seems so bad that we just junked the device and have now purchased a replacement."
4,"Works great, but sticky tape/pad doesn't stick","I bought four of these for my various vehicles because with all the electronic devices these days, one or two 12V outlets in a vehicle is a joke, especially for long trips. In fact, in my SUV that we use for long trips, I have two of these devices (radar detector, DVD player, two cell phones, tablet, GPS, bluetooth headset, cell booster, etc.).These devices work great and as advertised. You can connect four devices to each one, and the fuse never blows in normal usage. I would have a couple of spare 10A AGC fuses for a long trip, just in case. I had fuse blow once because when I disconnected a device, the device's plug came loose and a metal part just happened to short the receptacle - freak incident.My once complaint, if there is one, is that the sticky pad/tape taht comes with it does not always work. I had to use after-market 3M double-sided tape. To be fair, in one case even that didn't work."
1,Melted,"I thought this was a great item...at first. After 3 months of intermittent usage, the part that goes into the lighter melted. I checked with the manufacturer, who confirmed that item is still under warranty. Unfortunately, all I have to do is submit a check for $7.50 along with my receipt and pay the postage to mail the item to them and they will decide if they will repair or replace it!! The full cost on Amazon.com was less than $13.00 so I won't be returning it for warranty services! I am really disappointed!"
4,Nice product,"Nice product, works great with a sirius radio, gps and a radar detector. The sticky mounting pad that comes with it however is not sticky enough to keep it mounted. So I am looking for an alternative mounting system. The product does work fine though."
3,"Needs some tinkering, but works well...","...The socket contact doesn't seem very secure...if you touch it, the power light goes off; touch it again, light comes on. Needs some fiddling until it's making a good contact. Then it works great...I've had all 4 sockets filled with accessories (two different phone chargers, GPS, laptop), and it handles them no problem.Only other thing to note was that the mounting screws were short and flimsy. I screwed the unit into a hard, spongy dash and it wouldn't take. I simply used longer screws; now it's anchored in nice and tight. I've owned this for a year now, and depend on it daily. Recommended."
5,Power Scoket,"The product arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered and expected. Very Satisfied, I would definitely order again from this company."
1,This is terrible,"This unit is getting an arguably unfair review because of it's bad design. The plug is incredibly finicky and it moves an invisible amount that disconnects it several times while I am delivering pizzas. The plug that should be spring loaded and protruding is flat, unlike the item pictured. I'll post a picture of it."
1,This thing fails,This thing got short circuit the first time I use it. The ventilation in the picture is totally cosmetic and the product is actually closed end. Feel sorry to have believed in such ill-made stuff.
5,cool,this wasnt as big as i thought it would be it was a nice size wires long the tape was strong so it held
1,piece of crap,"Well this thing looked good and felt like a quality piece, but worked for exactly one day. I really have no idea why it has stopped working - it looks fine but there is no power to the ports. Other reviewers have had similar problems. I would avoid this particular power port since it seems to have a significant percentage of non-functioning units."
5,Solid Product,"Thanks for the other reviews.I have been using this adapter for a couple weeks.No problems with the item. The connections are solid and tight.I think it makes sense to have a cord on theadapter, some of the other ones plug in without a cord and people complainthat the whole adapter falls out of the plug. With this design you won't haveall that weight hanging on the plug."
4,Review for car power port,"An excellent port for your car - you can charge multiple car chargers - ipod, phone, blackberry, etc. No problems with shorting of power."
3,"LENMAR 3-Port DC Power Outlet, NOT 4-Port","This is a BIG Power Outlet, so only think about buying it if you have a LOT of space, and it needs to be permanently mounted. I wouldn't want something this BIG to be loose on my center console. It's furnished with a screw-down mounting system, but I mounted mine down low on the right side of the center console with Super-Glue. I didn't want to drill or put screw holes through my console. Also comes with a tape mounting system, but it's too heavy for the tape. One of the ports is fixed for a cigarette lighter, so you can't use it for a normal appliance power outlet, making it effectively a 3-port unit. I've been using it for 3 months with a GPS with a traffic monitor, an iPod kit, and a Radar detector with no issues at all: it handles the power necessary for all 3 just fine. It is HUGE though! Be prepared for its size, and weight, and you'll like its ability to handle power for 3 items with ease. 3 Stars for this one."
1,poor quality,"the male part works, but the female sockets failed. Of the four sockets, two broke down after a few months of use. The screws and springs inside the sockets just fell out. I seldom exchanged appliances and left them alone, but they still broke down."
5,Works Great So Far!,"I purchased this for a long car trip. With two kids, threeNintendo DSi Matte - Black, two DVD players, one cell phone with GPS and aGriffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black)for our iPod to play through the radio, we definitely needed more than two outlets up front.Even thought there are four ports shown, only three are working, unless you still use a cigarette lighter. The fourth port is for cigarette lighters only.We never had three things plugged in at once but definitely had two plugged in for long periods at a time. It got a little warm but never hot and it held up with all devices working properly.It appears sturdy but as with all electronics that get left in a car on hot and cold days, I'm sure it has a limited functionality. I'm hoping to get a few years out of it. I'll update down the road."
2,"Sturdy construction, but stopped working after a month","This one is sturdier and better designed than others I have had, but unfortunately it died after a month. It would cost as much to send it back and accept 85% of the value, so I'll just drop another $15 'cause it's very useful."
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased this product in September 2008 for use during the long car trips we take (only twice per year). It has always had some problems staying in my car's 12v socket. When plugged in just right, it will work, but it has often lost contact and I have to re-seat it in my car's lighter socket and find a position it ""likes"". This problem was evident to a degree when I first received the product, but I didn't return it as we were leaving on a trip the next morning. With each use, it seemed to stay connected less and less. On my trip in October 2009, it failed completely when the tip on the unit came off and became lodged in my 12v lighter port and it required quite a bit of work, and some luck, to remove.Even though we purchased it over a year ago, it was only subjected to very light use, maybe 35 hours in total during three trips and it failed. This is a very poorly made product with little quality control. Please don't waste your money."
1,Poor quality,The Lenmar SPP-04 Power Port 4 outlet DC power socket worked briefly and then blew car fuses and probably an internal fuse on the power port itself - which is impossible to change. Poor instructions.
5,"The Best ""I can Be""!","I have been a proud owner of this camera for several monthsnow.I had stepped-up from previously owning the Sony DSC-S50model and I couldn't be happier! I'm a ""Novice Photographer"" butthis camera is that ""ADVANCED"" to allow me to-be the BEST I canbe! I've been eagarly studying the Opt's Manual and learning ALLthe ""Manual Functions"" as I have'nt owned such a Camera that gaveMe so much Artistic Freedom!I am truly Excited with this little ""jewel"" and have Not beendisappointed with the Quality of photo's; Nor, the results of this DSC-S75 many options and features!I would strongly recommend getting the 64 or 128MB Memory Sticks and it wouldn't hurt to have ""More the ONE""!!!In Conclusion,i would say; I would think even a ProfessionalPhotographer would be happy with the Quality,Functionality,andHandling of this ""Amaging Camera"" by Sony: You WILL NOT be Unhappy to own,this Camera!!!"
4,kjb,"This would get five stars if it didn't take so long to take a picture. As noted in other reviews, there is a significant lag between pressing the button and taking the picture - a real negative when dealing with kids or action pictures.What I like:The ability to take a picture in one size and save it later as a different size. This is great for saving small files for emails, and also saving the same picture in a larger format so it has enough detail to print a crisp and clear picture.The camera uses the same battery, memory stick and power cord as my Sony digital video camera. Less stuff to pack and carry with you on vacation."
3,Fine but older,"NIce camera, but video are terrible quality. However, due to age, I dont worry about it being stolen or damaged."
5,So far so good!,"Replaced an ancient mechanical thermostat.Nothing but good things to say so far. Quite, efficient, handsome.Options I will never do without again:-7 Day Programmable-Auto Switch from Cool to HeatTook me about 3 hours to install, but only because I moved the thermostat location to another room an had to run new wires through the attic. The old thermostat was too close to a vent and never worked right. If I had just been replacing the thermostat I could have finished it in less than 45 minutes (including programming).Hope this helps."
4,Works great,Works great as advertised. Backlight is very good and display is nice and clear. Good product. Would reccomend to a friend.
5,Got this instead of the BGE version,"wanted this for the air ""circulate"" function. The blower comes on and off all day and keeps the temp steady way better than leaving it on auto. The install was easy. Had to get the wall plate to put behind because of the previous thermastat. looks great and is easy to use."
3,Same as trane?,"I heard that a trane 803 stat is actually this one (Honeywell TH8321),only the trane has the trane name stamped on it."
1,A good way to WASTE hard earned money,Honeywell TH8321 VisionPro programable multistage heat pump dehumidification digital thermostatI installed a new furnace and air conditioning system. I selected this thermostat based on Honeywell's propaganda. Both the furnace and thermostat were installed by a professional HVAC technician. My C H E A P programmable thermostat did the same thing as the Honeywell's advance settings are blocked by Honeywell to consumers (I called and got off shore representative and eMailed). The professional HVAC tech said the thermostat was set correctly. My very good heating and air conditioning system is impeded by the thermostat. Poor customer response to needs. Save money and go to Lowe's or Home Depot.
5,Very easy to install - even a nonmechanical person could do it!,"Very good product. I love the touch screen and the humity indicator. If you already have a thermostat installed just write down how the wires are wired into the current plate and use that as guide for installing the new thermostat. If you have all the tools, it takes about 15 minutes to uninstall old thermostat and install the new one. Don't forget to turn off the powere before you start. I am not a DIY person and this was an easy project. I was motivated since my current thermostat had died and I had no A/C."
1,2 burn outs,Initial system came with 3 of these units -- since installation 2 have burned out or become defective. Still under warranty -- had to pay $100 service call to have them replaced.
5,The Conquistadors with Michael Wood,"This was a fabulous take on the main stream Conquistadors, better than a lot of points by the Learning Channel version ""The Conquistadors"" Michael Wood's verbal descriptions were intense and informative. His exploration to the MODERN sites actually made the history more real! I would have liked to have seen a blend of Mr. Wood with the Learning Channel version with the reenactors. This video is one I will watch over and over."
3,good classroom conversation piece,"From the comments made by some reviewing this series, I can see that they are not practicing historians. Most modern historians understand the biases of especially contemporary and nineteenth century writers. It is interesting that they would question the presentation of modern research and not those of the past. That said, this presentation is a modern interpretation of the period of Spanish conquest. The one point that it shows better than most interpretations is the role that Native peoples played in the conquest of the Americas. Used in a classroom, the series is a good place to initiate conversations on cultural misunderstanding and conflict as well as the events portrayed."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK.,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSSED TO BE ABOUT THE CONQUISTADORS. I THINK THE HOST HAS AN EGO PROBLEM. HE SHOULD WATCH SOME OF THE KEN BURNS SHOWS SO HE WILL KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD SHOW. MANY TIMES THEY MAKE YOU WATCH THE HOST WALKING OR SHOW HIS BACK OR CLOSE UP SHOTS OF HIS FACE. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SHOWING IS RUINS,PAINTINGS FROM MUSEUMS, ACTORS IN COSTUMES ETC... I DID NOT WANT TO SEE A BUNCH OF GLAMORE SHOTS OF SOME GUY. THAT BEING SAID: SOME OF THE THINGS SHOWN ARE GOOD. THEY DO SHOW SOME RUINS ETC... BUT, THEY KEEP GOING BACK TO THE GLAMORE SHOTS OF THE HOST. ALSO, SOME OF THE SCENES ARE OUT OF PLACE. WHEN DISCUSSING THE TIME CORTEZ DESTROYED HIS SHIPS SO HIS SOLDIERS COULDEN'T LEAVE THEY SHOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE DRAGGING A MOTOR BOAT ON SHORE, WHEN DISCUSSING HIS MARCH INLAND THEY SHOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RIDING ON A BUS. THE INFORMATION DELIVERED VERBALLY IS GOOD. BUT, THEY COMPLETELY DESTROY THE MOOD FREQUENTLY WITH THE PRESENTATION."
1,Battery Eater,"This is a very good tv that consumes battery like crazy. At first, I used the regular AAA batteries and they lasted me way less than the 3 hours recommended. I started using rechargable batteries instead. However, after a 5-hour charge, this only gives me a 1 hour play. I am going to return this product after I go home today."
1,Casio EV-570 Handheld Portable TV,"TV does not work, whilst I get the picture, it is in black and white and there is no voice or sound apart from hissing noise."
1,Poor picture quality!,It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor. Buying this handheld was a big mistake!
4,Great Little TV,"This is a great little TV. Since I live about 25 miles from the local TV stations/transmitters, I was worried about reception. However, the reception is great for both UHF and VHF stations. Yesterday I watched game 3 of Yankee - Red Sox playoffs from a hammock in the back yard. The game was broadcast on a Fox VHF station. I would have given this five stars, but the battery life is short - about 2+ hours. Oh, this unit takes 4 AAA batteries, not 3AA batteries as listed in the Amazon description."
2,Headache inducer!,"This works just fine but the picture is so small that it gave me a headache after 45 minutes of viewing. Not for those susceptible to migraines. Also, it goes through batteries like a rabid raccoon goes through a dumpster. Mine lasted 2 hours. This may only be good for kids or sports nuts who can't be away from their tvs."
4,For those who love Hello Kitty,"This is a cute, fun, clock that is perfect for those who are Hello Kitty fans. The radio is a great added feature to the digiital clock. We got it for our daughter;s 9th bday and she loved it. She really likes using the night light on it too."
3,So far - Broke after one day,"My mother got this for my daughter yesterday and already the clock is broke.....will be sending it back for a new one, what a pain!"
3,Cute Clock,"This clock is cute and came to us in good shape. The clock, radio and alarm work as expected. Only complaints are there was no instruction book and we can't get the lemon slice to work as a nighlight as expected. Not a big deal as we bought if primarily for the alarm clock."
1,Buyer Beware! Clock doesn't work,We bought this for our 4 year old daughter's birthday. Cute clock - she loved it. We set the time initially and that worked okay. However later on the time had changed and was off by 5-6 hours. We tried to re-set the time but it wouldn't change at all. It was a similar experience to what g_mom's review was. We ended up just throwing it away (we had thrown the packaging out of course so couldn't return it). It wasn't fun having to take it away from our daughter either. This is a piece of junk - if you do decide to buy it make sure you save the packaging so you can return it.
3,"Beautiful Clock, but has glitches","The clock is amazing, and beautiful, BUT for some reason the time kept going backwards, and alarm would go off at anytime. Great clock, but it has some glitches. Other than that it's a good clock, but i had to return my daughter's."
4,good learning tool,This is good for a first alarm clock. It is cute and helps kids get up on time. Appears to be durable and will handle little hands playing with it.
1,Worked for a Week,"This is an adorable little alarm clock! The night light and radio worked perfect for us, however, within a week the clock wasn't. I first suspected something was wrong when my 5 year old's alarm went off at 4:55 in the morning. Knowing how 5 year olds like to play with things, I moved the clock to where she couldn't reach it and reset both time and alarm last night. At 7:00 this morning the clock was reading 9:04. While cute is great...functionality is much more important!"
1,Cute but useless after a few months,"This was cute, but a few months after we received it the volume knob stopped working so we weren't able to use it as an alarm clock. We've had to replace it with something more durable. Will not buy another electronic Hello Kitty item."
3,Hello Kitty Clock Radio,"This Clock radio is very cute. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. My only complaint and this is why I gave it a 3, is that I can hardly get any radio stations on it. The radio is scratchy and so I set it to buzzer for her."
3,Hello Kitty Radio,The clock is really cute but it has poor reception. Maybe if it had some form of an antenna it would help. It is hard to get a clear sound. It takes alot of movement to place it in the right spot to get clear reception.
2,Rubbish Radio,"Now, maybe I have just forgotten how bad analogue radio's are but you simply cannot tune this radio to a station and expect to continue listening to it. I have to constantly retune minute to minute. So my daughter may wake up to music or she may wake up to hissing and crackling. Very disappointing as she loves the visual design and the fact she can use easily see the clock, plus the little nightlight.I am contemplating returning it and simply dealing with the fall-out from my daughter as the radio is driving me mad!"
2,Doesn't do the job,While it works (i.e. tells time) the alarm function is a joke. I bought this so my daughter would have an alarm to wake up to in the morning for school. The sound is so faint that you can barely hear it and that is at the loudest setting. The music gets loud in the radio setting but when set to alarm the sound doesn't go loud at all. I will have to get something else as I am still my daughters alarm clock.
1,Ours did not work at all.,"We got this for our daughter and kept it in the box for months. When we finally unboxed it, out of the returns time-period, we were not happy to discover the clock did not work at all. We had to buy a different one."
5,great!,"My daughter recieved this clock as a gift a few years ago when she was ten for Christmas. She is now fourteen and is still loves to use it. It's working just like the day she recieved it, the radio gets good reception, and the alarm works (although setting it was confusing at first). Her only problem with it was the night light. It isn't terribly bright, but now that she's older she doesn't even use it!It's cute and it works. An overall a fantastic gift and purchase!"
3,Not what i expected,The picture is totally wrong. what youll get in the mail is a thinner lacy garter. and the material is kinda cheap. It hasnt ripped on me but the waist elastic is kinda tight. Kinda gives you a muffin top even if you dont have Much in that area. Id recommend a size up and im a small.
2,Not Incisive,"This biography on gandhi pales in comparison to other biographies done on him. Robert Payne seems hell bent on looking at incidences in Gandhi's life as either personal or selfish motives. While he manages to convince us of a possibility of a different viewpoint in some instances, in most cases he seems unduly critical and overtly suspicious. Looks like Mr. Payne believes that every motive in life has a selfish reason behind it. Sadly this paradigm does not allow him to dissect gandhi fairly. There are many facets to this great leader, both unfavourable and favourable, but it requires careful study of gandhi's philosphy and a unbiased approach which this book sadly lacks. There are better biographies available....."
4,Wonderful movie!,"One of my family's favorite movies, we can watch it over and over! Great humor and beautiful music in this movie."
2,"It helps if you do, too.","I did not care for the film too much. I bought it as a birthday gift for a friend who is a Julie Andrews fan, as I am myself, so I did watch it before I gave it away. I do like Blake Edwards as a director, and I liked the cast, but the film itself did not do too much for me. But that's just my opinion. I don't consider the film to be really a comedy, if that is what it is supposed to be. I guess it was just too het for my tastes. To quote Blaine and Antoine, the movie reviewers on ""In Living Color""--""Hated it!"""
2,BORING,"Pacing is very important. Also, the actors must say interesting things and keep the thing moving along. Burt and Julie in her office, not saying much, is not good film making. But, the part with the dog stuck to Burt's hand is very funny (although not as good as the sex outfit in NEVER AGAIN). There are far better comedies out there: Jack Lemon's stuff for instance(UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE, GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM, THE OUT OF TOWNERS)."
2,See the French Version,"Too slick, hip and cool for my britches. An Americanization of a European classic that doesn't work. Funny for American audience tastes, but too physical, too materialistic in its approach for my liking.There's a spiritual element to the Truffault version that's missing in the American one with Mr. Reynolds. The French one is more subtle, deeper and sincere."
3,Great copy,This movie is a faithful and fair adaptation of l'homme qui aimait des femmes. Well done and nicely modified for the American viewer (French diary is replaced by American therapist ). Nice photography but the movie feels dated
4,Different kind of movie,"If you are looking for something different, this movie is it.Great performance of Burt Reynolds. You may be surprised if you think that Burt is only a Bandit type actor. (I was.)"
3,"Purchased This Movie Thinking It Was Funny, But It Was Not.","Ok Movie, But Not Very Funny, Good Video Transfer, Very Good Burt Reynolds Performance, Also Marilu Henner, Along With Julie Andrews."
2,The man who loved women,"This movie was superficial. I did not find the characters interesting or an any way real. If it was ment to be funny, it missed the boat!"
4,I LIKE THIS HELLO KITTY TELEPHONE!,"I HAVE THIS HELLO KITTY TELEPHONE ,I BOUGHT IT AT TARGET FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ,SHE LOVES IT!IT,S SO CUTE.THE WINGS LIGHT UP!She has dropped it several times also and it is durable!"
1,high price/low quality,I purchased this phone from a different retailer for under thirty dollars and was still disappointed at its performance. handset falls off receiver easily. sound quality was always fuzzy but in addition after 3-4 weeks of use all my callers suddenly started sounding really far away. only purchase this if you find it elsewhere for cheaper and hope to use it mostly for decoration.
3,A few good tracks,"This is a disc of individual, unmixed house tracks. The first 5 tracks are on the groovier side of the spectrum (solid basslines, synth melodies) and the last 5 tracks are more tech influenced(harder beats, more electronic sound). All in all, the compilation is decent and everyone will have their favorite tracks, but there's enough difference between the styles that most people won't love the whole album."
3,FAIRLY PRICED.,"I GOT WHAT I NEEDED FROM THIS ITEM, IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO MY FRIENDS."
3,Hit & Miss,"Might be hard to call any of this a real ""miss"" because the selections themselves are so short they're overwith before you can come to dislike them.I've never read Cisneros before. I enjoyed her defending America as an American/Mexican more than a Mexican/American. She has a very clear determination to keep the difference distinguished.Her short-shorts were all very insightful, I think. The notion of creating a story within the confines of half a page can be daunting, yet, she manages it with relative ease.Of the short-shorts, ""Spic-Spanish"" and ""Hair"" had to be two of my favorites."
3,"Bartender, another scotch, please!","I have heard all of this trio's albums at one time or another. The melodies are pleasant and sometimes innovative, but I feel that the music is best absorbed in the atmosphere of a hotel lobby or bar."
3,informative book.,its useful I got it for emergencee`s incase I had any questions and God forbid didnt have internet connection! Im satisfied and prepared.
5,Typical South African,"Mfundisi Dube and his choir are nothing short of the expectations for a quality South African Gospel. This album, however, takes the expectations to the next level with the ushering in of the presence of God. The combination of American Gospel and SOUTH African grooves is perfectly performed and matched. ""Holy Spirit"" is a perfect example of this blend. He goes further by bringing in a great South African Gospel legend, Vuyo Mokoena, on the song ""Ngiyamthanda uJesu."" It takes me back to my old home church, Imbali AFM - led by the late Baba Ngidi. This cd is what you expect from a great South African group (talent, harmony) and a gospel group (the anointing). I love it!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,not very good mafia movie,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. Eric Roberts is a very goodactor stuck in a super long series of grade B or lower movies. Roberts is almostalways entertaining to watch even in the really bad ones. I can't say that aboutthis one. It's a decent story but every actor in it sleep walks through it. Robertsis too good an actor to be stuck in trash like this. There is very little I canrecommend about this flick.
4,Action packed with tinge of witticism,"Take the Mob, lots of action and mix it with a well written comedic script and you get a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Tired of the same old bloated budget spoofs? This is one to watch..."
4,Interesting Pick.,"This is a good movie if you like a lot of action. The pace was quick, the story was interesting, and I was totally engrossed from beginning to end. I definitely would recommend this movie."
2,Laughably bad,"If you're in the right mood, you can kind of laugh your way through this one. Getting in the right mood, however, will require at least half a bottle of scotch, or something stronger. I always excuse the actors in a movie like this because I know enough actors to know that they're working people just trying to make a living and doing the best they can with the material they've been given. It's the material, the writing, that I have no sympathy for in a movie like this. The script here is so poorly written it makes ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" look and sound like high concept cinematic art. Watch at your own risk. I'm giving it two stars because I did have some scotch on hand and it - the movie not the scotch - did, unintentionally I'm sure, make me laugh. I'd comment on the directing of the film but there wasn't any. :-) LOL. Like i said, watch at your own risk."
3,Good Movie for Action Freaks,"If you are an ERIC ROBERTS fan this is one for the books. Hitman's Run. A great story idea but it is destroyed by the direction. Choppy, sloppy and often confusing. Mark Lester seems to be going backwards instead of forward. It is saved only by Eric Roberts and Damian Chapa. I want to know who edited this thing. He or she fails to let the shots develop especially in the action sequences. Great car chases, good fight scenes and hefty explosions. Who did the 2nd Unit? It really carried and probably saved the movie. Yes, low-budget but still a good, no-brainer Friday night experience. MARK LESTER: BRING ME MORE LIKE THAT!"
5,Get this movie,"Although more intelligent than the typical ""blow it up and grunt a cocky one-liner before kissing the girl"" action flick, Hitman's Run will never win any awards for drama. But hey, let's face it, if you like drama, you are probably not shopping for a movie with a picture on the jacket of a large gun aimed at your face. I really enjoyed this movie and agree with the first reviewer that the writing was quite good while the direction was a little heavy handed at times. The dialogue was biting, overall plot development was solid without getting in the way of the action, and the characters were as believable as you are going to find in this genre. I would highly recommend this film."
4,A pleasant surprise!,"Great plot, cool characters, intense action. For anyone who likes discovering obscure movies, instead of just watching whatever's at the local multi-plex, this is one for your collection."
5,Hitman's Run,This is an action packed film. Eric Roberts was a great choice for the lead. Five stars for the screenwriter. I hope this is just the beginning for Eric Barker.
3,Hitman's Run,"A bit skeptical at first, however knowing Eric Barker's writing, I knew he could pull it off. This was definately action packed, but with a gripping and compelling story. Gibson may have been busy that day, but it is his loss not Mr. Barker's. Good job Eric!"
5,My Review,GREAT ACTION MOVIE! A new and exciting look into the witness protection program. The writer takes you on a dangerous and often times humorous journey.
3,Well done Eric....another winner.,"When I first saw this video at Blockbuster, I ignored it thinking it was just another man with a gun film. Upon recommendation from a friend, I rented it and was totally blown away. It was brilliant. I would gladly sell my house and all its contents just to see the sequel. Although the direction was lacking and there are some strange edits, this film has an underlying genius to the plot...offbeat, avante garde, and refreshingly different. I hope to see more from this writer."
4,A gritty spine tingling descent into the killer's psyche,"The DVD version of this movie has finally arrived and finally, this movie can enjoy its just desserts. First of all, I am happy to see it in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. I will skip the discourse on the beautiful digital color saturation and crisp images the DVD version brilliantly displays.Hitman's Run contains the kind of brilliant psychological study of the violent mind that can only be found in movies such as Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, and Jean Pierre Melville's Le Samourai.The plot unfolds like a butterfly spreading its wings...and the dialogue, crisp and terse hammers through like some of the best Noir, Tournier's Out of The Past or Marhall's The Blue Dahlia...Anyone familiar with Mark L.Lester's work will find this one arguably his best thesis on crime and the psychological unwindings of a killer."
1,"Looks cool, works bad","I had the previous model of the st louis phone and it lasted awhile and was great, but it quit working and I got this model. Its absolutely worthless! I can hardly hear when im on the phone with someone. And, the retractable cord would be a great idea if it actually retracted properly and had enough cord to actually retract. There are also little lights in the top, I think they are supposed to work.. they don't. and they clock seems to work randomly. This is the most unreliable and useless phone I have ever owned. It looks really cool though. They should have spent more time on its funcionality instead of packaging."
5,"just a perfect ""phone-on-a-cord""","it's looking quite decoratively and it works like a charm, it has a marvellous sound quality, it has memory function and doesn't need any power-supply - just a perfect ""phone-on-a-cord"""
5,Robert Altman's Masterpiece,"Short Cuts goes through a few days in the life of 22 Los Angeles citizens. The 183 minute running time doesn't feel long in this beautiful masterpiece.On the surface it's just another tale of an interlocking dramatic ensemble piece. That's where the similarities to Altman'sNashvillestops. This gets deeper into the characters. You learn to support each of them, the story never focuses on one character too long, and it never leaves a character too long either.The cast is wonderful. Matthew Modine, Julianne Moore, Andy McDowell, Bruce Davidson, Jack Lemmon, Lily Tomlin, Chris Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Downey Jr. There's plenty more and they all help to carve out their characters and make you pay attention to each and every one of them.Plus, the DVD is loaded. One missing feature is a commentary from Robert Altman himself. I would've loved to hear his words over the film, but too bad that's not possible.Must Have."
2,Altman Ruins Carver,"Raymond Carver is my hero, I am a published author and I just watched Robert Altman ruin Raymond Carver. If you want to make a movie of Carver's stories you should present them as individual stories and not have a weak threaded story line, do yourself a favor and read Carver's stories. Read and think for yourself."
2,Carver cut to ribbons,"Some years ago I took a couple of friends along to see this film. I was wildly optimistic, since I'd read all Carver's masterpiece short stories. I don't usually compare films with the books they are based on, but for this I'll make an exception. It was terrible. I felt embarrassed that I'd deceived my friends so badly, and they couldn't understand why I'd wanted to see this mess. Altman managed to erase everything that is great in Carver's writing, and retain everything that is dull, ordinary and boring. Actually Carver is never dull, ordinary or boring. I couldn't believe it, but I'm glad to see several reviewers agree. Altman seems to have no sensitivity whatsoever to Carver's particular genius. What is truly amazing is that those reviewers who have NOT read Carver seem to think the film is good! This is a very puzzling situation."
2,"not bad, just disappointing after Carver's stories","I just wanted to respond to Michael Crane's review, if you've read it. I don't say this to insult him in any way, but I agree with most but not all of what he says. It could have treated Carver better and he's right about ""So Much Water So Close to Home"" and ""They're Not Your Husband."" But ""A Small, Good Thing?!"" It's not even faithful in letter, as the treatment of ""So Much Water So Close to Home"" basically is! I found it to be another story completely. If you haven't, read the book! The movie is not bad, but it's so totally different that you don't have a clue of Carver's plots or characters or maybe even general sensibility without the book."
1,Misanthropy on Display,"If you read the short stories by Raymond Carver that this movie is based on, you will see how much he loved humankind despite its flaws; this disgusting film displays how much Altman detests people. Carver is spinning in his grave."
3,Beware...,"If you liked the original stories, this version may prove a disappointment. Carver has a distinct tone, and this movie comes close, but I don't want a game of horseshoes. This movie is much too bright and shiny (you'll see what I mean) to hold true to the originals. As a movie, it is good. As an adaptation of Carver, I'd have to say it stinks."
5,stealthy greatness!,"Like a few others in Altman's career, a truly great film operating on a stealth level. A Southern California Theater of the Absurd all moving toward the sacrifice. That image of Matthew Modine holding that balloon and making that sound will stay in my memory the rest of my life. Not a movie for the impatient. Altman adept and even and driving it home--a director who's mastered his craft and can, every once in a while, create a true gem. There's a reason why everyone in Hollywood wants to be in one of his films when it looks like he's latched onto something good. They know they'll have a place in the film-greats history books. This may be his best. I watched it in three installments, so the length wasn't exhausting. Maybe that helps with the digestion too. Wonderfully absurd in a low key. Highly recommended for the discriminating viewer."
3,And A Half,"Short Cuts was fairly good. It was well acted and the stories were good too. Yet, something was missing. The main reason why I watched this movie is because so many people were saying that Magnolia was somewhat like it. Well, since I loved Magnolia, I decided to give it a shot. It wasn't bad but there was nothing like a good surprise except for the ending. Overall I think I liked Magnolia allot better but Short Cuts is definatly a movie that should not be ignored."
1,Didn't like it,"A brutal killing, female frontal nudity for no apparent purpose, a character fantasizing about abusing his partner, a mom who is a phone-sex worker (while watching her children), etc. This stuff was not entertaining to me. Yes, there were some interesting parts that made me think, but overall it wasn't worth it. I don't mind a long movie, but this was a 3-hour slice of LA life that too-often felt boring, repugnant, and pointless."
1,Dullsville,"Acting technique was good by a handful of actors, but the plot and character development were weak. No socially redeeming value to the story. Not entertaining or worth the rental."
4,good,"I saw this when I was stranded, and had nothing else to do, and I expected to dislike it, because I'd read some of the Raymond Carver stories they were based on, and knew how tedious Carver's writing is. And the movie is 3 hours long, too! Much to my surprise, I didn't look at my watch once, but found the film really involving. I was amazed how Altman made a silk purse out of Carver's sow's ear. I'm not a fan of films with both ensemble acting and incidental structures, but I liked this one."
3,Live TV,"Mosaic of pieces presenting live moments of a city dwellers interrupting and coexisting separately, unknowingly affecting each other, is nothing new to cinematography. As well as a story of a corpse found while fishing-this very similar still (body was of an indigenous girl)was deliberated in Australia after ""Jubinnee"" or something.For loving a reality TV and long dramas."
3,"Not the greatest DVD transfer, I'm disappointed, I have to say","Some DVDs look good even when up-converted. This one doesn't. But then again, it has that sort of gritty look, which kind of works. But for being a Criterion disk, I thought it would be better, but it's not. The film is still great in its strange way."
2,My First Chapter,I don't understand it and I only red a few pages of the book. But I am only 10 and adults would probably understand it better than I do.
5,fell in love with it,"i've always been interested J.M. Barrie's work, and this was is simply AMAZING. J.M. Barrie obviously had fun writing and creating this world. the first few pages aren't good to judge the rest of the book for. i loved them, too, but most people wouldn't. other than that, i liked this more than Peter Pan."
5,For the Non_Techi Enthusisit who would like to be,"As a fan of open wheel racing and F1 in particular this book is an absolute joy. I have always marveled at the team aspect of the sport. Drive and engineer working along side of the mechanics as a team to produce the fastest car on Sunday. TV couldn't show you how this is being done, but you knew it was happening. The engineers were reviewing the data, talking to the drivers and then focusing the mechanics to get the car that extra 10th of a second. Then back at the factory, the aerodynamicist are working 24/7 to get even more out of the car.This book shows the fruits of their collective efforts and explains them in a way the fan and the engineer can understand and appreciate. A first rate father's day gift and an excellent choice for any other occasions for a racing fan. I'm going back and buying the rest of the series!"
1,Sour and Bitter,"I have only tried the raw Sourwood honey from Savannah Bee Company but I have had 35+ years of experience eating and tasting sourwood honey throughout the SE United States. I lived in Blue Ridge, GA on the Tocca River and had Sourwood trees on my property. The sourwood honey I received from Savannah Bee Company was like no other sourwood honey I have ever tasted. It was actually sour on the initial taste, then bitter on the after taste. It was thick and a rather dark amber color. Anyone that knows sourwood honey knows it is not supposed to be sour. I have never experienced bitter honey before in my life. A small amount of the honey had leaked in the packaging during shipment making unpacking a messy affair. I give this honey 1 star only because there is no lower ranking. If you are thinking about buying this product do yourself a favor and buy from another sourwood producer as well, then taste for yourself the difference."
4,Must see Anime,"How far do we let technology take us? Should we consign our old people to an uncaring ""home"", or cherish their hard earned wisdom? This film brings up many questions that are hard to answer, and makes you think about old people and what they want and need. Oh, its funny too, and you have to love the ending (did you like Short Circuit 1 and 2?)"
3,VHS Quality on DVD,"This DVD contains a bad video transfer. No anamorphic video either. It says ""Special Widescreen Edition"" on the front, the video is presented letterboxed.While definitely watchable, there was some combing (artefacts on moving edges) which suggests problems (or just laziness) while digitalizing the movie.I'd say wait for another release but who knows when this will be."
3,well...,"I bought this movie on a whim, what i got was worth the money, but jus barely. the story in general was very funny, well planned and really makes you think about how we treat our elders (Not as people but as burdens) and the characters were very fun and you could easly relate to them however, there is little action and the animation is somewhat poor. I would recomend this movie to people who understand wit, sarcasm, and social satire. In other words, any one who thought that dumb and dumber was an excelent flim will hate this movie."
4,Good but not as good as I like it a few years ago,An anime story about a nurse and his 70 year old patient. I liked this movie but for me it has lost some of it's freshness over the years. Still it's worth seeing to see Haruko Mishashi and Mr. Takazawa and also the bad guys Terada and Hasegawa.rating 13 up: minor nudity and sexual jokes
4,I had to do this...,"I was scanning for a new anime when I saw RoujinZ AND the little bit of review from DJ-Crackhead (DJMETH) -which you can read for yourself. This anime, for me, is one of the funniest out there and I've seen most of them - warning; you have to pay attention! The dialog is fast and you can miss the acronyms ie-agedly challenged = A.C.H.E. and how about the -Special Homes In The Sun = ;-) - if you really enjoy anime, buy it! It's certainly worth renting at least once. ps - I wrote this to push an unfair review down the list, so, if you don't agree with me, that's fine, you can sound off about it to me at JJsWorld@kc.rr.com. I only ask you watch the film and judge for yourself."
5,One of my 10 favorite movies,"I'm not that much of a fan of anime but this along with Sailor Moon are the only two animes that appeal interest to me.This is a great story about an old man Takazawa, being put into a bed, the Z-001 created by Terada, a big bully like man. The bed will do anything for Takazawa and his nurse Haruko (who looks like my sister) knows that Takazawa doesn't like being inside of it. Thus begins a wild ride as the bed later begins thinking it's Takazawa's wife and it goes bezerk across the city en route to the beach at Kamakura.This movie is also pretty funny especially the three old men who Haruko meets in the hospital. I certanly recommend it."
2,Roujin zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"A prototype mechanized bed designed to take care of the elderly morphs into a powerful robot and goes on a rampage in order to take its occupant on one more trip to the beach. There's a bit of social commentary about Japan's rapidly aging society in the premise; however, a character's comment that it's not right to put the aged in mechanical beds because that just hides the problem neatly sums up everything ""Roujin Z"" has to say on the subject. The rest of the film is rampaging robots, lowbrow comedy, and widespread destruction, none of it very interesting either visually or dramatically.Despite the undeniable talent and experience of Japan's animation industry, I continue to be surprised and annoyed that the same big-eyed, narrow-jawed character design is so prevalent. It seems to be a convention of the genre that fans just accept, but it made me feel that I had already seen ""Roujin Z"" as soon as it began."
1,Please Turn it off!!!,"Cant believe I sat through this. Maybe I was just in a bad mood that day? An old guy bonds with a unit designed to keep him healthy. They go out of control as it becomes his wife (due to programming), and then it is over. There was some humor, but enough to make up for the boredom."
2,A pretty pathetic plot!!,"This movie was a little below average. It was hardly entertainting. I do give it some credit just because it was good enough to watch through; but I'll tell ya, I've only completely given up on one anime, which was ""Armageddon"". This is probably one of the least memorable animes ever. The only thing that seperates this from one star, is the fact that I don't think anything-exept that movie which I choose not to name-can hit rock bottom. Right After you watch this film you'll think, hey it's pretty good. But then a couple months later it will be just a vague memory in your head."
1,what a waist of my time,when i watch a manga film i expect good gore and violence not a story about the aging population of futuristic japan and beds fighting each other - this film is shit
3,Eh,"At first I was happy with this purchase, but it too quickly came apart from the cloth. We just use it without the cloth."
4,"Amazing images, just wish the human side was quite as strong","Breathtaking images, for the first time Antonioni's career in color. I'd be happy to have still frames from this framed on my wall. But the acting and writing didn't match the power of the images for me, at least on first viewing.Monica Vitti is a housewife losing her mind, who quickly (and without clear reason) obsesses a badly dubbed Richard Harris, who is visiting Vitti's husband on business. What makes this less powerful for me than L'Venturra and L'Ecisse is here the characters talk a lot more, and a lot of the dialogue is stilted and false sounding; way too full of `meaning' when the images are already so symbolic. And while Vitti is a good actress, she's not Liv Ulmann or Meryl Streep. But where it fails as drama, it's amazing as storytelling through images. Every time everyone shut up, I was immediately drawn back in."
4,Red Desert withstands the sands of time,"Sure, the pacing is slow compared to today's hyper/cyber entertainments, but Antonioni's visuals are still incomparable. Scene after scene resembles nothing so much as a Matisse canvas, and the final shot is a stunner. Lovely, achingly felt picture."
5,One of the great ones,"This film is not flawless. The ""bedtime story"" interlude goes nowhere and the casting of Richard Harris, however commercially expedient it may have been in 1965, can only be lamented today. But Antonioni's gift as a visual stylist (stunningly summarized in the career montage they put together for him during the Oscar show a couple of years ago) may have reached its peak here. The film certainly deserves the best restoration and transfer it can be given at this late date."
3,The Last of Antonioni's Italy,"When Red Desert was released, even the most ardent Antonioni fans expressed grave concern. Then Michelangelo abandoned Italy. In hindsight (always a precarious vantage point), this film is in many ways far superior to his subsequent work (the once popular 'Blow-Up' has dated terribly). The problem with the film is Monica Vitti's character. Is she psychotic? If so, it makes everything she experiences suspect. Richard Harris is suitably stolid as her befuddled husband. In later years, Harris confessed that he found Antonioni to be a ""pseudo-intellectual."" This, from the Man Called Horse! But what does the film try to say about our industrialized world? Antonioni was obviously fascinated by it and by its implications, as contemporary interviews suggest. But his film seems to present it as a nightmare - through which poor Monica Vitti stumbles, bewildered."
3,"Save your money, track down the BFI DVD of this film.","If you have a multi-region player, you should order the British Film Institute DVD of RED DESERT/IL DESERTO ROSSO film from England. It's transferred from the original negative and has much more faithful color than the unrestored, somewhat faded materials used for the now out-of-print Image Entertainment edition that currently goes for high prices. Don't get me wrong, the Image Entertainment edition isn't that bad, but it pales next to the BFI. The quality of the color is critical for this particular film.The BFI has also released a Blu-ray of the same transfer, and I hear it's stunning. But it's region ""B,"" and all-region Blu-ray players are extremely difficult to come by.Until a company like Criterion releases a new transfer of THE RED DESERT in the U.S., the imported BFI DVD is your best option."
4,cinematography -- not plot,"It is fitting that L. Maltin thinks this movie is boring. Most people would agree. Sorry, there are no explosions or other sparkling lights in this movie -- but if you appreciate great photography you will enjoy it. Don't think of Antonioni's movies as 'movies;' you'll just be bored if you do. They are movies in the oldest sense of the term: ""moving pictures."""
2,great when it works..........but.............,"i just ordered my 4th replacement model. that's right, my FOURTH. my first model lasted one year before it died (and i'm fastidious with my cleaning of the unit), and they have sent me 2 refurbished replacements in the past 2 months that have died within 3-4 weeks after arrival. today they said they will send out a new model based on these problems. and guess what? my original model had a ""full five year warranty"", but the newer units only have one year on their warranty. gee, i wonder why...............................for the record, i own a quadra as well, and it had never given us any trouble at all."
1,Sharper Image SI719 Tabletop Silent Air Purifier with Ionic Breeze,"I purchased this item to replace one that I had - loved my first ionizer. this ionizer is not working. I contacted the seller to get additional information about a condition that is not covered in the manual (flashing blue light). The seller was not helpful at all. I am very disappointed in both, the ionizer and the seller."
3,Great while it worked,"I loved this air cleaner. I, too, cleaned it often as the directions suggest if not cleaned it can burn out. I used this in my bedroom and while it worked, it was great. Not even a year and it suddenly just stopped working. No light, no cleaning. The Sharper Image website is down stating something great is coming. I just hope it will be a replacement for my broken machine but I won't get my hopes up per the previous comment I read here."
2,Firecracker!,"Had this model for about a year and it did clean a tiny bit of dust from the air, but after 6 months it started to make the crackle sound randomly. This crackle sound eventually got so bad that to have this thing on would be quite scary, and we did clean it regularly and let it dry overnight. I later looked inside to see that this crackling sound was little sparks of electricity! Really not a worth while item, and didn't seem to safe to have something that would be making sparks constantly. Eventually it seemed to stop working even when we would attempt to use with the crackling sounds."
2,Don't do it !!!!,"This purifier works great when it works, but I just threw away my third tabletop purifier today. Something about this model does not stand up to the test of time. Sorry, I have waisted money and time (a little over a year since the first one was bought) with this model. I have Sharper Image's bathroom (small space)model--no problems in a year but I am afraid to try one of their bigger models after the tabletop mess."
2,stops working,I'm on my replacement one right now since the 1st one stopped working within a month. My second one doesn't seem to be working right either. I wouldn't waste money on this.
2,Good when they work . . . . .,"I purchased two of these. Within one year one had to be returned. They sent a new one. Now 1 1/2 years later both of them are not working. I noticed they reduced their ""lifetime"" warranty to 5 years. I'll be sending both of these back providing they allow me to."
4,Ravi Shankar -- an early publication,"having read Raga Mala, the autobiography of/by Ravi Shankar first published by Genesis Publications, i expected with this volume titled ""My Music, My Life"" to be somewhat thicker (that's why only 4 stars applied). on the other side it's a very interesting manual on the actual structure and playing of the indian music on the sitar. at first hearing, the indian music appears disharmonic to our western harmonic music trained ears, however, over the years i fell in love with indian music and this volume allows a closer look inside the making of the disharmonic to make us understand it better and love it even more so.JohPWilbrand"
4,Start your exploration of Indian classical music from here...,"This book is a veritable autobiography of Indian classical music itself....a tribute to the absolute identification of the student with his subject..Beautiful high quality pictures adorn the entire book and a technical manual of Sitar at the end provide a uniquely informative and pleasent book for a stumbler (like me), as well as I imagine a purposeful pursuer of Indian classical music's roots and traditions. A great coffee table book too."
5,A GITA ON MUSIC,"A beautiful offering! It is not just the world of music which is the richer for this account. Music, a system - or - music, a way of life. Devotion, dedication, service, and the universality of this music is Vedanta, lived and written of by Ravi Shankar. This lucid presentation of an exceptional culture is a way open for appreciation and more."
1,Stinks,"Literally, they stink...the buckwheat hulls they used to stuff it were old or bad or something.I bought 2, and the day they came my brother walked into the house and said ""What smells like rotten ham?""I hope it was just a single bad batch but I returned them promptly and shopped locally, where I could smell them first."
4,Meditation comfort,The zafu meditation cushion filled with buckwheat hulls is very comfortable. I have a synthetic fill cushion and much prefer this new accessory.
5,Item is perfect,I purchased this shape because I have hip problems. It's perfect for addressing that problem! The item itself is of good quality as well.
1,This is not the PDM-711 model,I bought this unit becuase it was advertised as a PDM-711 and in reality is is a PDM-714. Unfortunately this means 2 things1. it is not compatable with the docking station2. it has inferior PQ compared to the PDM-711.I am going to return the unit since I cannot use it with my docking station and it is inferior in picture (newer decode chip I guess)
1,Does not work on Nylon!!,"I was searching for a good dye for nylon, the product says it is great. I tried it, did everything it asked, and no good results, poor product."
4,Mai~ Eri Sugai,I really enjoy this CD because it's good to hear music where the voice is used as part of the song instead of the main focus. Not that lyrics are unimportant but it's nice to listen to music where the lyrics are not shoving themselves down your ears.
1,Buy a Mac,"This pc crashed a few times already, lost music files. Wireless keyboard and mouse have software issues. I will buy a Mac next time."
1,Total Disappointment,Bought this from Circuit City when it was new. It has been the most hassle of any PC I have owned including a self-built windows ME machine...this one has been the one to finally convince me to go with Apple after my whole life on PCs...stay away...
1,really old machine,"I was looking for an old driver and found that this is still for sale. I paid $1000 for this 1.5 years ago and if you know anything about computers, 1.5 years is oooooold. The DVD read/write cant read the new warhammer dvd game , even with the lastest updates. The video grapic nvidia doesnt have its own memory (only shared) and the list goes on. It is a socket 7 mother board. Better put this one out to pasture or sell it for its true outdated worth of about $350...not bad for surfing the net or editing home movies."
4,Nice,This Rosin is working very well. I wasn't sure what to buy and I didn't want to get anything very expensive. This has worked well for us.
1,Not as good as I remember them,"Sadly this is one CD I should have not brought, the band was great in my memory but not some much when I actually heard them again... buy The Jam, The Cords, The Purple Hearts or Secret Affair CD's instead."
2,Yawn,"Very tedious to read. Yet another framework, whose primary purpose is to give you something to remember, rather than to simplify your life or help you find the focus to achieve your goals.I give it two stars, rather than one, because I can believe it might help a reader who'd never before read a book of this type. If the title piques your interest, I suggest checking it out at the library before you buy.But there really are so much better professional and personal self-help books out there. One of my favorites:Improv Wisdom: Don't Prepare, Just Show Up."
5,My favorite scent,"I bought this based on the reviews and ratings it received. At first, I was somewhat skeptical about its risky scent. It did smell a little rubbery at first, but it disappears, on me at least, after twenty minutes and turns into a more vanilla-like scent that lasts all day long. I highly recommend this scent! And the bottle itself is gorgeous, too."
5,"love, love love this...","this is my favorite perfume. I got a sample, tried it and totally fell in love. I ordered 2.5 bottle and wear it every day. people often ask me what kind of perfume I wear. this is my fragrance!!!"
4,It's real.,"I was a bit nervous that I was buying a fake fragrance. After I compared it to the one I bought from a store, I felt it passed the test."
4,Amazing scent after the top notes fade,Never really like the idea of unisex fragrances but Black create a beautiful unique scent of light vanilla. But the only flaw is that the first 15 to 45 minutes smells like new rubber tires. Not really disgusting as it may seem. When right this fragrance is in my top 10. Low projection and has about a 5 hour duration (4 exclude the 1/2 hour rubber phrase)
4,Bvlgari Black,"My package arrived a day early, and that was a great surprize. It smells amazing. It has a very entreging scent. A scent an ""interesting"" person may wear. I just can't wait to have a reason to wear it. I purchased this because a friend of mine says he gets compliments all the time. Women asking what scent he's wearing"
2,NOT IMPRESSED !!,"I WAS THINKING ITS GONNA LAST FEW HOURS AS SOME REVIEWS SAID , BUT THATS NOT TRUE , I GOES AWAY AFTER NOT MORE THAN 2 HOURS . EVEN-THOUGH I SPRAYED 6 TIMES THIS MORNING , ITS SMELLING GOOD BUT DONT LAST"
4,Amazing,"This product amazed me without a doubt. I bought this cologne with absolutely no idea what it smells like and kept my fingers crossed based of the previous reviews.Firstly I must add that this cologne, indeed, smells like a tyre and you should be very wary of how many sprays you apply to your body/clothing. I for one think the cut off point is 4 at maximum. As the day progresses on, it mellows out into a warm vanilla scent that's not too strong, not to mild. Simply perfect.At night this cologne definitely shines. I've had numerous compliments about it, some even ""closer"" than expected ;). My personal favourite being ""My my, I don't think I'd want my husband smelling this on me. Might take a few spin cycles to get it out"".Amazing product!AAMerchants also delivered the product on time as expected. I live in the Caribbean though, so it took a little longer to get my product from the US to my island but all in all my experience wasn't badI'd recommend this to anyone."
1,Not for women,"Contrary to what is written ""for men and women"" I am sure this not advisable for women. Not my perfume type, I just get hooked with the looks of the bottle and its packaging, but doesnt smell really nice. I dont know with men."
2,I wonder why the reviewers are telling lie.,The fragrance doesn't last after half an hour !!!! U need a waste one like this ? think !!!!! I spent 31.55 for this . A total waste.
3,I did not recieve it,"I did not recieve it, I called amazon and at the same time they send me a new one."
4,"Wonderful in ideas, not as wonderful in factual info","This is a wonderful book for exploration of women's mysteries and the relation to instinct and the moon. I would recommend it with a warning about two things, however:1. MANY assertions of fact in the book needed citations and had none, leaving me asking where she got the particular assertion she was making at that time.2. There were a number of factual errors of which I am aware (and possibly more I don't know), such as claiming millions of witches were burned during the Inquisition period - a faulty claim made by Margaret Murray which has been reputably refuted since.If one reads this book with a critical eye to the information presented as facts, however, this book does have a lot to offer, and I would recommend it."
3,Several deficincies.,"1. The price was too high after I invested in a battery and charger which should have been included in the purchase price.2. The included 4MB memory stick is an insult. It will not even store one uncompressed image. The expensive 65MB stick should be included in the purchase price.3. Flash pictures are almost invariably too dark.4. Shots made at ""Auto"" white balance are almost never as true as at ""Indoor"" or ""Outdood"" settings.5. I sent 3 e-mails asking for clarification of statements in the manual. After 7 months I still haven't gotten an answer."
1,Haunted by E:92:00 error,"We love / loved this camera until the dreaded E:92:00 error popped up, making the camera unusable. We did buy the extended warranty from Best Buy but their extended warranty policy says that the camera can be out for 4 fixes for same problem, then they can, ""at their discretion"" replace the item. We have returned it for this problem 4 times, and they still didn't want to replace it. They have replaced all of the internal parts two times. Still they Said there was nothing wrong with the camera even though the E:92:00 error is all over the internet as a problem with this camera. Finally after telling them I had been without my camera for 50 days in the first 5 months of my daughter's life, someone took sympathy on me and we are getting a new camera. Hope Sony has fixed the problem."
3,Disappointing.,"One thing to beware right now with any Sony electronics product is Sony's pitiful service capability. I shipped my DSC-P50 to Sony over three weeks ago. The problem? It wouldn't turn on. Maybe the battery, maybe the recharger for the battery, or maybe it's internal to the camera. I shipped it all back. The address of the service center was a secret. They have consolidated their service centers, and my camera has been shipped by Sony from Podunk, PA, where I sent it, to Boston, where it is apparently riding beneath the streets with poor Charlie on the MTA. Or, it has been handed off from one technician to another and may be underneath a large pile in a large warehouse. Today the word is, they might be finished on the 19th, which will make it five weeks since I shipped it although they claim their average is 10 working days. If I were shopping for a new camera I'd avoid any Sony product."
3,The E:92:00 error: A SOLUTION!,"It seems that EVERYONE is having this error pop-up at some time or another using this camera.Call $ony and they'll tell you to send it to them along with $139.00 and they'll fix it.Well, don't do that. You can fix it for $0.10, and here's the reason it blinks that error and how to fix it:The problem is the battery isn't making a good enough contact. After you put the battery in, place a dime on top of it and shut the battery door.My camera works fine now."
2,Not a Great Sony Product,"I had very high hopes for this camera -- mainly because I have always really liked Sony products -- but have been pretty disappointed with it. Not only does it churn through batteries (as everyone else has said), you also cannot upload pictures to your PC without going through a pretty cumbersome process. To top it all off, calling Sony for advice on uplaoding pictures from this camera did not get me any help at all (in fact, I think it convinced me never to buy Sony again!)"
3,Review of Sony DSC-P50,"If you buy this camera, make sure you purchase the ""optional"" rechargeable lithium battery and power pack. This camera eats batteries. A set of 2 double-A batteries will last about 4 to 5 pictures if you use the flash. If you use the flash and the LCD screen, you might only get 2 to 3 minutes of camera life, enough for just a couple pictures.It's very easy to accidentally set the camera to take pictures at slower shutter speeds. The results are very blurry pictures. So the camera is not exactly fool-proof, and with such short battery life with the LCD screen on, you have to flip through the options very quickly to retain your battery life (which leads to mistakes in setting the exposure time, etc.)I hope these problems I'm having with battery life will be relieved once I purchase the optional battery pack. As it is, the camera is almost un-usable with normal batteries."
1,Stopped Working After Only a Month,"I Wish I Could Say Anything Good About My Experience with This Product. I Bought This From ANTOnline, a Third Party Seller on Amazon, to Use in My Work Van. I Used This Maybe 3 or 4 Times Before It Stopped Working Completely. However, I Did Not Buy This from Amazon.com Directly, So That May Have Been One of the Reasons That This Product Failed. Good Luck with Your Search !!"
2,danco,"parts look great but they are the wrong ones ,i asked before ordering but did not fit ,i used the handles anyway . to ship them back cost too much so i just used the handles."
3,northwestern wall phone,"The delivery was satisfactory, however, the phone was silver color and did not fit into the kitchen color scheme, therefore, I sent it back.I have received the credit for it and and satisfied with the service.Thankyou for your kind attention.Sylvia L."
5,Rollicking Good Old Fashion Sci fi fun,"If you like non-stop action, decent writing, and fun, you should pick up this novel by Farmer. He develops character enough so you have people to cheer for, and just enough mystery about the world he is creating to keep you going. Bravo! Definitely a master storyteller!"
2,Pretty lies,"Beautiful scenes, pretty colors BUT not a documentary. This is shameless propaganda. Historically inaccurate. Even when historical events are presented, they are sugarcoated, eg., taking healthy male children from Christian families (never to see them again) to raise them as muslim soldiers is justified because they received a ""good education"". This is a small example of how low the producers of this video went in distorting historical truth to please the muslim viewers. Shame!"
2,"plodding, vacuous","Slow, not a lot of content, many gratuitious images of people racing around on horseback. The whole thing could have been compressed greatly, and cost much less to make, if they hadn't been so preoccupied with dressing people up in an attempt to recreate action. I really wanted a nice overview of Islam and couldn't stand sitting through all the dross."
4,great movie for school,I am teaching a cultures class for middle school students. This movie fits right into my curriculum and helps present the information in a format that the students enjoy. I am so glad I found it!
4,"Generally well done docu, though not without faults","The PBS documentary ""Islam: Empire of Faith"", being rebroadcast locally, perhaps because of the recent terrorist attacks, provides a great overview of the brightest period of Islamic greatness: those centuries during the middle ages when Europe was still stumbling around in, if not the darkness, at least in dim light. It is not, however, unlike some people claim, without its biases: While it spends time detailing how awful the Crusaders of the 11th-12th centuries were, it makes no mention, when talking about the conquest of Constantinople (now Istanbul) by Mehmed II in 1453, of the countless Christians (men, women, & children) slaughtered by his armies, even though it mentions the conquest of the great church in which they were slaughtered: the Haggia Sophia. Otherwise a beautiful documentary..."
2,Empires--Islam: Empire of Faith DVD,"A lot of the information in this public broadcast DVD is incorrect. Also, it paints a very one-sided, unrealistically positive picture of Islam that obviously isn't true and doesn't add up to modern-day experience nor present-day teaching in college courses dealing with the History of Western Civilization."
3,Glosses over many major events,Other reviewers are accurate. It tells a rather lopsided view of the history of the times. Glosses over many major events.
3,Ok,"I found the video good, with a nice amount of new facts and information that I did not previously know. I also appreciated the re-enactment scenes. However, if you're trying to show it to a room full of 13 year olds, they will find it boring. Documentaries need to be more creatively cinematic to keep teens attention nowadays. I don't know of a better option, but half of the kids were interested, and the other half were bored to tears and talking off topic.A comparison of good creative cinematics would be the History Channel's The Story of Us. It is meant to educate AND entertain. That is what kids expect nowadays, and it keeps student attention."
5,Informative Tale of the Islamic Faith,"This really was a well made documentary. Informative and to the point. Its interesting how many of us consider ourselves to be religious, yet we dont really understand even the basics of other faiths. Islam is one of the major religions of the world along with Christianity, Judaism, Hindu and a few others. It is an ordered monotheistic belief very much like Christianity. The program was impartial and fair, giving rich history of Muslims without being overly for or against their beliefs. Muslim faith, ideals, conquest, commerce, city managment and daily life were discussed. The difference between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims was explained. And given recent world events in the Middle East, it was a timely program."
4,"Islam, Empire Of Faith","Unlike many other ""biased"" documentaries produced in the Western world, Islam Empire of Faith, was a well-balanced, historical and objective look at Islam. I truly enjoyed wathching it. I will most definitiely recommend it to Muslims and non-Muslims."
2,"An ""infomercial"" for Islam!","Watched this when it was shown as a fund raiser by local KOCE educational channel. The ""glories"" of Islamic accomplishments during its' 12-14 century heyday are emphasized interspersed by glowing tributes of academics with practically no mention of the cruelty of it's conquests or the repressiveness rampant in Islamic regimes. Pure propaganda!"
5,A MUST SEE,An eye opener. I've watched it so many times and learned something new every time I watched it. Order it and you won't be sorry.
2,empires; islam empire of faith,I was very disappointed with this DVD. I thought it too pro Islam and too brief in its coverage of Islam's conquests and movement into Southeast Asia and India.
2,Revisionist history at its finest,"Don't waste your time - this is a classic piece of a selective retelling of history. One example: the oppression and massaacre of Jews during the Islamic conquest of the Arabian peninsula is completely left out of the narrative. Absent of that fact it's junk, let alone the persistent anti-Christian bias throughout the DVD."
4,Islam,This movie was very easy to understand and follow. You get to learn more about the history of Islam and the story of Mahammad and his struggles thourgh life. I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn about any religion or is planning on majoring in it in college.
1,Pretty Propaganda,"This is a grotesque misrepresentation of Islamic history and doctrine. There is no mention of the centuries of aggressive warfare, oppression, and enslavement that Islam brought to Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. One of the most appalling sequences involves a dramatization of the life of Christian boys stolen from their homes under the devshirme system. These boys were forcibly converted to Islam and then turned into oppressors of their own people suffering under Islamic rule, particularly in the Balkans. The movie shows them as happily learning to wash themselves before entering a mosque, playing and holding hands. Despite looking and sounding beautiful, the entire production is a lying disgrace."
1,corporate agenda,After watching this documentary . I wondered what was the need of allowing so much time to cover the story of the life and activities of SULTAN OF TURKEY (that was the most boring part of it). it would have been nice if the producer had utilized that time to explore the esoteric side of Islam as well. the idea of this documentary must have hatched out of some corporate agenda.I did not like this at all and will not waste my time to watch it again.
5,Very informational,Used this movie to home school a 6th grader. There is great online source material to go with the DVD. Helpful in covering all the basics in a precise way.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,This book is so out of date it isn't even funny. Save your money and buy a real book on German collecting from a reputiable writer. This book is a complete waste of time and money.
1,The out of date part is right.,"Concise is being generous. Skip this book, Whitmans are the ones to buy."
3,"A concise, but now outdated price guide","Published by the reknowned Manions' Auction Company, this small book is a concise price guide to german militeria. Included in the price guide is almost everything: books, helmets, medals, badges, uniforms, photos, identification books, posters etc.. Heavily illustrated with small photographs and concisely described, the items number in the thousands. Sadly, however, the prices listed are now almost seven years out of date. It is now rare for example, to find an original Second World War, Iron Cross First Class for only $85.00. A good supplemental reference work and a useful ""floor"" price reference, this book provides a good representation of items usually offered for sale on the open market. This book however,is by no means comprehensive. It should never be used to completely authenticate an item."
3,military,Book OK. Could have had more pictures. Could have had more information about collectibles. Not sure I would recommend this book.
1,Manions - Price Guide,"Prior to the demise of the Manion family ownership, the price guide only tells of the auction price, but not really the price that Manions (at that time) were loading up onto the purchase or selling of any item with commission, shipping, handling, insurance. I have receipts of both activities to prove this near 50% addition. Sadly but true, it is best to ignore this book - look to better and more reliable sources that truly reflect the prices one can expect to see in this weeks auction or buy-me-now.In fairness to the Auction house taken over by Jody, go review their web site and see for yourself, plus there are very good dealers out there that cleanly and easily display their wares & charges - Jamie Cross Militaria, R.M.Militaria, DandB Militaria, MandT Militaria, Berliner-auktionshaus to give you an idea.If you buy this book, it's for the pretty pictures.Dr. Syn 2011"
4,"""His Secret Life"" shouldn't be a secret -- buy it soon!","Wow--what a powerful story. I'm not normally one to pick up a foreign movie (I hate reading subtitles; that's what books are for!), but the story sounded very intriguing: a recent widow who was in a happy, loving marriage discovers that her husband was living a double-life...with another man for seven years. Both of his relationships were loving...and he obviously couldn't bring himself to pick between the two because he loved both of them. In a sense, he was monogamous...with two people.The movie was even better than I had expected. There was so much emotion between the main characters -- the two ""widows."" I loved that there was tension at the beginning between the two and, from the love of the same man, they eventually grew a friendship...and grew to love each other as well. It was a very moving story, and I highly recommend it."
3,Soccer Referee Advice - dated,"Soccer laws underwent a major revision in 1997, and as this book is a 1995 edition there are references to former laws throughout the book that are no longer applicable. That is fine if you are aware of the changes in the laws, but very confusing if you aren't.Much of the book seems to be a tribute to pillars of the soccer community from the end of the last century. Great for a historical perspective, but not useful to a referee today.Finally, some of the specific advice given directly contradicts current teaching and practice. Though a 1995 edition, the book is dated."
5,Night Fire,I am a huge Shannon Tweed fan. The order arrived in excellent shape for a used dvd and arrived quickly.
4,Limited uses,"Sturdy construction but more curved than photo suggests. Looks more like. Grab bar than towl bar. Could not hang two tea towels on it, only one."
5,A Truly Talented New Voice Arrives,"This book marks the arrival of a writer I'm very sure will become a household name in the near future. James Canon is a very talented writer and this book proves the depth of his imagination. It tells the story of how the women from a small town in the Andes mountains of Colombia struggle to survive after all the men are forcibly taken or executed by the guerrillas. James Canon moved to the States from Colombia to study English and ended up getting a writing degree from Columbia University. He wrote this book in English, so there is nothing lost in the translation. He weaves a modern day tale which includes magical realism, war dispatches, heartfelt love and much more. Each chapter is followed by a chronicle from the land of men in which members of the leftist guerrillas, the paramilitary forces and the Colombian army share their experiences of the endless war. I was very touched by this book and highly recommend it."
3,culture life changes,"Found the book somewhat depressing .... unlike most books that I would choose to read. The challanges, changes, and lifestyle of the characters could of course compare with other cultures. At times I had to set the book aside and read something lighter!"
5,Wonderful story!,"Highly recommended read, especially for those who enjoy literature from Latin America. Combines the magical realism of much of the literature I've read from Colombia, alongside personal stories of the many-years-long conflict. A very beatiful epic-like and unusual story of love, interdependence and the will to survive."
5,"Oh, just get the damn thing!","Fabulous. The best book of its kind. No rock reference book is better. Period. It's also worth tracking down older editions, since with each revision the series undergoes interesting transitions, shedding some reviews, changing or adding others."
3,sort of an add-on to the original editions,"I knew the first and second editions as excellent references. This fifth edition pretty much drops of the majority of stuff pre-1990 and adds info from 1991 to only about to the end of 1995 really. kinda sketchy overall, with the limited timeframe while also trying to cover so many styles.It is a shame that this is probably the last book that is going to be printed in this reference series. It is all online at trouserpress.com."
3,A Bitch to clean,"The bowls do their job and to be honest, there really isn't anything wrong with them. However, you have to clean them every two weeks or they become disgusting and start to smell. I suppose that's how it is with all non-filtered fish bowls but these are not the easiest things to clean.Again they're a good product. There is nothing wrong with the design or manufacture."
4,cant knock it over,The nicest thing about this fish bowl is that it hangs on the wall and not on a table where kids can knock it over. The kids can enjoy being near the bowl without the adults fear of a mess.
1,Jeez!,"This is animal cruelty! The water is going toxic in two days, no pump, no air flow, no heat, no nothing. The bigger the tank, the easier to clean and keep steady water values. If you are going to keep fish, be bothered to learn aquatic chemistry. If not, the fish will surely die and you can get a picture in stead."
1,product not same as picture - BEWARE,"I was dissapointed in this product. The cross section is not as shown in picture. The ""T"" flanges at the top are different widths. Be aware, and no way to tell from the described dimensions."
5,Beautiful trio music,"I have been listening to a lot of piano trios lately, especially Keith Jarrett and Brad Mehldau. Bill Charlip's playing is beautiful and his improvising full of clear, gorgeously crafted solos. The bassist and drummer never get in each other's way and always support the melodies. When they solo, their work is always great. If you love piano trios full of beautiful melodies without being sappy or smarmy, buy this album."
4,Hello Kitty,Nice calculator. It has the date and time and an alarm built it. Quit sturdy for a kids calculator. The only downfall is that it beeps each time you press a button. This can get a bit annoying if your six-year-old is in love with it.
4,Recommended for introducing the concept of use cases,"Excellent short book with examples following the text. I would recommend the book for anyone needing an introduction to the usage of use case in software development. The only complaint is that the book is too short. With its small size, the areas that the authors declared as outside the scope of the book, could have been at least been discussed briefly. Also, there are several modeling tools now available that allow developers to create use cases and business rules and automatically generate object models. These also are not mentioned."
3,I thought it was really good until...,"This was the first book that really helped me to write use cases as part of my job and I really liked it until I found Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistair Cockburn. I took a class from Alistair and found certain concepts in his book and class that Applying Use Cases doesn't have to be extremely useful (you'll have to look at the book since this is a review of Applying Use Cases). Although this was a very good book for its time, I no longer even open it."
4,A Very Practical Book,It is an easy to read and practical book. You can easily customize and apply its methods in your project.
4,Thumbs Up,"I liked this text. I'm a programmer, and may have increased project management responsibilities in the future. This book described an intuitive methodology that I feel confident about using.Basically, they use the Rational Unified Process, and explain where use cases can be used at each juncture. They also get into some tricky situations, like denoting your error trapping in your use case, showing conditionals, etc.I agree with the prior reviewer that said the dialogs of the fictitious project team got to be a little much. They were really painful to read."
2,Nice for the 30 days it worked,"This microwave is big and the Inverter technology is nice but it only worked for 30 days and now it buzzes and doesn't cook.I had read other reviews that said it's quality was lacking and just thought they had got one built on a Monday (hangover day) but it appears Panasonics quality is sadly lacking. I am sending mine back, don't know what I am going to get now. My last microwave worked fine for over 6 years until the turntable stopped working."
2,Nice but did not work out of the box,"I bought this microwave 2/21/10, it is beautiful and has a lot of features. But the turntable did not work the day I got it. I returned it, no problems, and got a different brand. Also, it does take a lot of counter space."
5,luv this cd!!,"i just can't get enough of ""rockstar potential"" from the awesome band from canada, TUULI. these girls rock hard. they also have an awesome pop edge and their songs are so catchy and infectious, i expect great things from this band. a super talented group of young ladies who are ready to take on the world!!"
1,an example of how NOT to write a biography,"Cleveland's story itself is very interesting, but unfortunately this author butchers the concept of biography so badly that it interferes with the story. This is an excellent example of several things to not do when writing a biography, and serves as a great reminder for why we should appreciate the great ones when they come along. The author excessively editorializes (and very simplistically so at that), inserts his own self into the book too frequently (why at all, I ask?), and often contradicts his own interjected opinions with evidence that a few pages later proves the exact opposite. It gets so muddled on occasion that it is hard to understand how the author came to hold such strong opinions (that for some reason he felt were necessary to include) in the first place. My advice: look elsewhere...I do NOT recommend this book."
2,The Boys Are Getting Old . . .,"Well, Slayers' newest live concert footage lacks energy compared to their shows in their sprightly youth, that's for sure. Kerry King looks like an idiot sporting his new Anton LaVey 'do, and a lot of the aggression that Slayer was so famed for is gone. A disappointment for hardcore metal-heads will be the appearance of ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach hanging with the bad boys and the one Venom cover (""Witching Hour"") was utterly butchered. Slayer was once a great band, but they just haven't held up the way Motorhead or the Ramones have. A little goofing off is shown behind the scenes, but most of it is low-energy concert footage. I tghink it's time they gave it up before they have no fans left."
4,A MUST FOR SLAYER FANS,"This video showcases Slayer's live performance in all its brutality. Recorded on the DIVINE INTERVENTION tour it features amazing renditions of classics such as AT DAWN THEY SLEEP, RAINING BLOOD and HELL AWAITS as well as a cover of Venom's WITCHING HOUR. The documentary footage is interesting, the video opens with some lunatic fan getting SLAYER carved into his arm, and another moron staggering out of a record store signing looking like he's soiled himself, saying ""Tom called me a fag! I'm going to go home and light a candle! SLAAAAYYYYYERRRR!"". What a loser. There is also some amusing footage of the band on and off the road which shows that despite their music they are actually happy, good humored guys. No signs of satanic rituals, drug abuse or animal sacrifices- Tipper Gore, you need to get a life."
5,Slayer Live Intrusion,This is one of the best concert videos I have seeni got this as a christmas gift.I was looking for a good Slayer show for a longtimeThis is as close to the Ultimate revenge as youcan get.GREAT JAMM
5,Watched on YouTube!,"I didn't even know this was out until i heard news about the dvd's release date. Slayer playing live on their ""Divine Intervention"" tour is perfect since i love that album. I watched all of the concert footage on youtube and it is excellent! I haven't watched the behind the scenes stuff yet but the concert footage alone is worth it. The dvd comes out in a month or two and its only $10 on amazon. Support your Slayer!"
3,It's okay sums it up,"A lot of finger pointing that I am sure future historians aren't interested in cracking. But following the ""dialogue"" can be challenging"
1,This Remedy Gave me a Headache!,"I am a writer. I write poetry, murder mysteries, fairytales for adults and the occassional freelance travel article. I am just beginning a weekly syndicated column this fall 2007 (watch for it!)Anyway I bought this 'word remedy for writers' hoping it would be a fun way to enhance my vocabulary when writing and also help stimulate new ideas for sentence structures.In order to even check out the words to see if you want to buy it you have to unwrap the bottle and carefully dislodge each word one at a time. This would have been fine EXCEPT that all of the words were extremely mundane. The most interesting word in the bunch was 'wrench'!If you are a writer I would definitely NOT recommend this. And if you are looking for a fun gift to have on your fridge - check out the other word magnet possibilities."
3,Explorations,"From the little bit that I've read of this book, it seems to explain things fairly well, but they way they have written it makes me feel like I'm being scolded. (""You should have no trouble figuring out..."", ""Use your common sense,"" ""If you were unsure of its meaning before, it should be very clear now."")"
2,Shimmer Dust,I had a hard time with the dust. I tried it with vodka to make a wet shimmer and also tried sprinkling it on. I didn't have good luck. I will have to do more research and figure it out I supose.
2,Gritty,"I have used lustre, pearl and shimmer dusts for years and this is the lowest quality I have seen. The consistency is gritty..does not give a ""shimmer"" to anything. It seemed like a good value, but again, you get what you pay for. Stick with their long thin tubes of dusts bought seperately."
1,horrible,I thought it was me since this was my first time using dust. But after reading the other reviews I see everyone else has the same problem. I watched several video's to make sure I was doing it right and I still couldn't get it to work. I'm very disappointed because I purchased several packages to get every color and it was just a wast of money.
1,junk,"This is an awful product, gritty, chunky, no shimmer. This is worse than fine sugar. No shimmer or luster, does not even stick to frosting and I tried several times with this junk. Don't buy u will be disappointed. Ugly sand!"
1,False economy,"I thought I was getting away with something when I found this product in a local store. I wouldn't have to order the other brand online or pay shipping. It was the first time I'd tried a product like this. I dissolved it in vodka per the recommendations and watched at least three instructional videos on YouTube before I did it. I used the gold on cookies decorated with Royal icing. I started with yellow/gold icing and brushed the dissolved powder over my Superbowl helmet cookies. I made San Francisco Giants helmets and was trying to achieve that metallic gold color. Even after it dried, they just looked wet. They were glossy looking, not metallic at all. I would not buy this product again, and will be looking for an alternative."
5,Good Stuff,"I bought the CD after I had seen the film twice so I knew pretty much what I was buying. It is one of the best soundtracks I have purchased all year (and I have purchased alot. I like nearly every song on it. The only songs I do not care for at all are the Groove Armada one and the Baha Men one. It is a popish-light album, so if that is what you are looking for than this is a great CD. I personally think the best song on the album is Miss United States because it cracks me up every time."
5,Totally Cool~,"This is definately worth the money! I listen to it over and over!1. One In a Million (remix - I love!! I give it 5 stars*2. If Everybody looked the same- Is an OK song..3 stars*3. She's a Lady (remix) I like! 4 stars*4. Anywhere USA - WONDERFUL! 5 stars*5. Dancing Queen - So cool! 5 stars*6. Lets get it on - I cannot stand! 1 star*7. Get ya party on - The coolest song on the CD! 5 stars*8. None of your business - NEAT, but not my favorite! 4 stars*9. Mustang Sally - Old, but still cool! 5 stars*10. Bullets - STUPID AND I HATE IT! 1 star *11. Liquored Up and Lacquered Down- Listen to the words! 4 stars*12. Miss United States - HILARIOUS! 4 stars*13. One in a Million - I love it! 5 stars*This CD is so neat there is only 2 songs I hate on this CD, the others are so worth it!"
4,Not a bad C-D,"This cd has a lot of pop sounding songs on it. When I first saw the movie and heard the songs I wanted to get the soundtrack immediatly. My faves would be Anywhere USA, One In A Million(I love that one!), and Dancing Queen. This cd is really rad!"
5,Designed to Be Portable,"If you are thinking about ordering this book, think about why you want it. It is a small paperback book with only black and white photos, not a coffee table book. It is intended to be carried around the city with you while you look at the buildings. With that said, it contains photos and descriptions of 167 buildings and additional information such as a glossary and a list of buildings that have been destroyed since they appeared in previous editions."
5,Great Item,Actually better then I thought. It is larger and the wheels actually turn on it. My little boy loves it.
5,A Useful Reference,"Hixon's book provides a brief and well organized source for both the astute grammarian and the accidental writer. While not as comprehensive as some sources, this source is all substance without the frills--which can be confusing to the budding writer--and gives clear, excellent examples. A must-have for composition students!"
4,"4 1/2 stars, not 4.","Have you seen a handheld tv and thought, ""Wow, that thing is awesome!"" but never actually owned one? Well, the time is now to get one. With this tv as top of the line as they come, you get everything you want: beautiful resolution, clear sound, and good picture with the right position of the antenna. The only draw back to this is that it [uses] batteries faster than you can drool over the picture quality. So invest in some good rechargeable batteries while you're shopping. Once you have them, you're all set! So, to conclude, this is a wonderful tv in every way, assuming you have a healthy supply of batteries on hand."
4,Know what you are buying !,"I already had a Sony DSC S50 for myself and was looking for another less expensive camera for my daughter. I purchased the P30 for her and assumed that it was accessorized like my own camera. After purchase, I realized that the camera kit DID NOT INCLUDE a rechargeable power supply or recharger. The supplied AA batteries will only last about 2 hours under the best conditions. The batteries were shot by the time I familiarized myself with the operating manual. You can purchase an accessory kit from Sony for about $99 that includes a rechargable lithium battery, charger, and a camera case. I would have preferred to purchase the camera with this equipment included."
1,A Complete waste of money,I am very sorry that I bought this. It will not hold battery power or take a decent picture. Yuck!
2,Not the best at this price,Although the feature set is quite nice on the DSC-P30. There are to very bad problems. The Image focus is finicky and motion images are typically of poor quality.You could excuse the camera but there are others like the Canon A10 that gets it all right.
4,AC POWER ADAPTER,I just want buy this one. But I find there's no AC power adapter included. Does the Sony DSC-P30 has a jack for AC power adaper? and where can I buy one?
4,Great for traveling,"In the world of electronics, you really cannot go wrong with Sony. I use this camera for work and travel, and it never dissapoints. Light, but clear, it will go with you and take great sharp pictures with ease. The nice thing about this, and other digital cameras, is you can pick what pictures you want to print and which ones to throw away. Easy to share pictures with family online, and keep on your computer for easy storage. I would recommend this camera for novices-experts."
4,Super Digicam!!!,"I bought the Sony P30 and I realy enjoy it, but don't think the [initial cost is] everything you have to pay. I bought me the Starterkit because you really need a better batterie for that camera because the batteries they ship doesn't work really long.But if you choose to buy this camera , I think you really will enjoy it too!!"
4,Another winner from Sony,"If you want a camera for sending pictures over the Internet or for small photos, then the Sony DSC-P30 camera is a great entry level camera. Even though it's 1.3 megapixels, this camera has a lot features not available on other 1.3 megapixels such as 6X zoom and mpeg movie (no audio). The best feature I like is the macro setting as it lets you take pictures up close of very small objects. Since, I publish trout flies over the internet, I have got comments about the great picture quality.The only downside to the camera is battery comsumption. I would recommend buying batteries specially designed for digital cameras. When I go fishing I often bring a spare pair of batteries and over a day I can run out of power. The best way to solve that problem is turn off the viewfinder."
2,"Nice camera - the battery issue is terrible, however","We bought this for my sister for her birthday. It is a great camera, but the rate that it goes through AA batteries is inexcusable. My sister has had it for 2 days and has gone through 4 sets of AA batteries. She is exchanging the camera for a different model.You can purchase a separate Infolithium battery system for it, however by doing that the cost of the camera overall approaches that of some other superior cameras."
2,Not that good...,"I work as a sushi chef in a very busy restaurant. After playing around with the makisu for several minutes, I noticed that the product was very light and flimsy. Very much like a sheet of paper. It lacked the sturdiness that a traditional makisu has which helps evenly mold sushi rolls. I was fascinated by the idea of a makisu that was very hygenic but it sacrificed speed as well as performance. Overall I was not impressed."
2,Not stiff enough,I bought one figuring it would be better than the traditional bamboo unfortunately it is rather floppy. As a result one can not get even pressure on the roll to shape it. I found that it was worse in making rolls than the low cost bamboo despite the benefits of being easier to clean it is not worth it.
4,sushi chef's review,"This new age rolling mat is great for ""inside out"" rolls. It is highly recommended for the more experienced however, because it is harder to apply pressure evenly unless you are comfortable rolling a sushi roll freehand in the first place. This item is a great supplement to the traditional bamboo sushi rolling mat!"
5,Excellent book to understand how simply improve your communication skills,"Excellent book to understand how simply improve your communication skills. I suggest to read this book in order to gain awareness about communication pitfalls and simple way to communicate better with your friends, your family, and at work. I suggested it to my Life Coaching and Executive Coaching clients.[...] suggests as wellEnergy Leadership: Transforming Your Workplace and Your Life from the Core"
1,Don't waste your Real money,"I don't have time to give this book a thorough review, but I just wanted to chime-in regarding my STRONG disappointment. I couldn't even finish it. There might be some nuggets in there somewhere, but I doubt it's worth the agony.The author made up lots of lines just for ""dramatic effect"", and he coined some very annoying terms -- they're distracting. He doesn't distinguish between tough love and abuse and he doesn't articulate what being real, or authentic, truly is -- it's about being loving. If he intended to teach about being loving, he failed.I started out enthusiastically underlining and drawing stars beside sentences, but shortly that gave way writing ""B.S."" in the margin over and over. I stopped reading about the time he wrote, ""It never pays off to sacrifice,"" and two pages later I wrote in the margin, ""Is this guy nuts? I want my money back."" I was done!The only concept of his I liked was that we should be ""real"" nice, not just nice."
3,USE WITH CAUTION,"I have had this lamp for over a year,to its credit. However, the other day it got left on longer than usual and it burned a hole through the shade. Kind of scary for an active childs room.Better for child over 6."
5,KR Tools 11751 Pro series 15 in. Sabre Tooth Pull Saw Review,"This saw is fabulous, because it is versatile and can cut wood, plastic (pvc pipe, etc.), so that it can be used by plumber's, loggers, etc. You can cut large diameter pvc pipe and small diameter branch-type wood for firewood. It saws fast and stays sharp always. I have one for about ten years and it has never failed. i bougt it originally @ Sears for $ 15. Go get one now, you won't regret it!"
2,FUN TO WATCH BEFORE GOING CAMPING,"I first saw this movie on a rented VHS tape back in the early 80's, and fell in love with it. I kept a copy of this movie through the years and watched it probably 50 or 60 times. It's an excellent - though low budget, sometimes campy and sometimes boring - yarn about a search for the elusive Bigfoot. The comedy comes from the acting, which leaves a lot to be desired. But overall, this is an excellent ""good time"" campy B-rated movie that has brought me much joy throughout the years, and will likely continue to do so long into the future."
3,A worthy entry in the Cinema du Sasquatch,"This is a film about Bigfoot, in my opinion. I felt they were too much emphasis on sex in this movie, and it is not suitable for small children under three or so. This definitely is not one of Joy Houck's better efforts as a filmmaker, Brain Machine and Gray Matter were much more cool, although kind of similar to each other. Anyway on the plus side though, this film has excellent special effects and make up, with a very realistic looking Bigfoot. I would like to see this movie gets remade one-day, preferably by Disney or Tarantino."
2,Can I have my money back please?,"I am a huge fan of ""The Legend Of Boggy Creek"". Everytime I read about ""Boggy Creek"" , this film ""Creature From Black Lake"" seems to come up as well. It is recommended by many fans of Boggy Creek. SO I end up paying more than I should to have ""Creature"" in my DVD collection. I had never seen the film before it arrived in the mail. It was just terrible, not even good on a campy level. Frankly, I feel it was a waste of money, there were so many other movies I had been wanting yet instead bought this BOMB. Don't let the reviews foil you. It is awful. It is unintentionally funny (the acting). And frankly, if I could, I would get my money back from Amazon and send this DVD back. The reason I give it 2 stars is because the monster make-up was better than Boggy Creek."
3,Third best,Saw it as a child and still think its one of the best made. Not to many movies are made on this subject and wish it weren't so. but who can?
1,Creature from black lake,"When the movie was delivered I had played the movie and noticed the movie looked like it was bootlegged and poorly done at that most of the movie didnt play, so I didnt get to watch but 15 minutes of the movie. I would like to know who I can contact to get my money back."
3,Entertaining,"I used to stay up and watch this flick on the late show. Good cast and some tense moments(ie;the tree and knife scene).Also the bigfoot scenes were staged well.Black Lake and Boggy Creek are probably two of the best bigfoot films made so far(excluding yeti films like the Abominable Snowman with Peter Cushing).Not alot of blood and profanity.Just an entertaining little story. I would have added another star if it had been in widescreen and a better transfer.It almost looks like it's been copied from a vcr.The sound is pretty bad also.Not good quality at all, but that's all there is for now. Remember,this is a low budget 70s flick without the cgi,gore and profanity. I recommend it."
3,"Good Product, but Won't Support many devices","So the Product is inexpensive compared to what is out there on the market. The swivel/lock combination is perfect for fitting it into tight spots (like my Mini Cooper) and being able to provide various angles for the outputs.Now for the Bad, this product (as other reviewers have noted) will not support more than 1 powered item by default. I plugged in a Cell Charger and an FM Transmitter, and within minutes it popped the 3 amp fuse inside of the unit. I upgraded the standard auto 3 amp fuse to a 5 amp fuse and that fixed the issue, however if you are looking for running some heavy devices or multiple devices, i would stay away from this unit."
3,No power cord!,"The item is great...it's well priced, and provides a great deal of protection for my electronics, BUT...It doesn't come with a friggin POWER CORD. I had to go out and buy a power cord just plug the darn thing in! The instruction say to use the power cord from your own electronic device, but none of my devices had the same 3 prong connector found on the back of the AVR. I must say that it's the first time I've ever bought anything that didn't come with a power cord. Really irritated me."
3,Important facts about this product,The actual capacity is 1952 cu. in. NOT 2707 as is listed there. Check the manufacturers website and you will see for yourself. I think thats why some people feel it is too small.I ordered one myself thinking it is 2707 cu. in. but it is not so i am promptly returning mine and getting the Access instead.
5,Excellent well-designed comfortable pack,"Couldn't ask for more. Sleek, tough, solid pack with very comfortable padded straps and pleasing fit. Plenty of pockets and a bottle mesh on the side... perfect student/beach/dayhike pack. And very nice-looking as well!"
5,Great heavy-duty backpack,"Great backpack! Its used everyday by a very active teenager, and it has no issues with materials, zippers, etc. Built well and stands up to pretty rough use. On average, the books she carries in it weigh about 17-20 lbs, plus supplies and personal stuff, etc. and it has been really reliable and well made. We're sold on this company and this brand!"
3,Although it looks good....,We've only had this pack for about two months but one of the zippers aren't working. It's a bummer because it has nice features and a good amount of space for our laptop.
3,Overall good,"I am happy with the backpack, however one of the zipper pulls did come loose, but that could have happened with any bag, it was something that I just needed to reattach."
4,Very good material,The material construction is very good. Very durable. Only one problem with the size in the pocket for laptop. For laptops 15.4 wide screen is not good at all.. but is a very good backpack.
5,HORRIFICALY OVERPRICED - BE AWARE!,This product is selling at multiple other toy stores and web site retailers for about $15!!!!!! Not used! New! Identical! BEWARE!!!
2,It's not black!,"All of Devcon's input indicates the product is ""black"". It's not - after mixing it comes out dark grey, as indicated on the blister pack, but not on the Amazon listing. The hardener is off white, blended = grey."
5,Excellent resource that any parent or teacher must read!!!,"This book is a great resource for all parents, whether their child has a speech concern or not. I really enjoyed the practical activities and helpful guidelines. I now know what to expect at different age levels and this book has allayed any concerns I might have about my child's speech or language. Great book!!"
4,An excellent thought-provoking scenario for our computer age,"This short novel, by D.F.Jones, and the first in a series of three, is enjoyable and deals with man's futile attempt to bring peace and co-operation between the Cold War adversaries by the use of super-computers. I found the auther writes in a similar style to the short adventure/sci-fi novels of Isaac Asimov and it is very easy to finish the novel in a short period.The most frustrating part I have found is my inability to find the remaining two novels in the series, being ""Colossus and the Crab"" and ""The Fall of Colossus"""
2,"Rigid, Wooden Performance","For a recording made in 1929, the sound on the first seven parts of The Crucifixion (the balance of the recording was made in the early 30's) is remarkably good, and with noted Metropolitan Opera baritone, Lawrence Tibbett, as soloist, I looked forward to a very interesting recording. However, the performance seemed very rigid, very wooden, very stilted. It lacked the lyrical, ethereal quality, which I enjoy and have come to expect in church compositions. This made it difficult to listen to this CD and virtually impossible to enjoy it."
5,ENJOY,"the first video installment of the 'classic' danzig line-up,showing the likes of 'twist of cain' and the immortal 'mother' mixed with personal interveiws with all four members of the band extremely good picture and audio through-out for a 15 year old vhs tape."
5,listen up all you metal and hardrock heads!,"Danzig is the man! The video Danzig is real good,I have everything he's ever made,everyone get it,he's the evil elvis of our generation! woo!"
4,Danzig givs me chills,Danzig rocks.Sure he's a little cheesy but his musical talent is 110% on the money.For those who don't know there's a video for Lucifuge and Danzig 6 had been released through emagine. Killer stuff!
4,"VERY NATURAL, VERY ATTRACTIVE","Long appreciated for his women's wear designs Shanghai born Alfred Sung introduced his first fragrance in 1986, ""Sung, Alfred Sung."" Since then he has offered several popular scents, among them are ""Forever,"" ""Pure,"" and ""Shi.""Once he turned his attention to men's fragrances he enjoyed the same success, beginning with ""Sung Homme"" in 1988. ""Hei,"" his latest scent for men is also sure to please with its green, fresh fragrance underscored by spices, woods and musks. Nature augments the fragrance with notes of Fennel, Neroli, Jasmine, Lavender, and Cardamon. There's even a hint of spearmint.The bottle is pure Sung, a water drop in a rich blue tone capped by a darkened metallic round. On the top panel of the blue box is found the Chinese symbol for energy, an appropriate description of this scent."
1,"Simplistic, lacking depth and personal finance perspective","This is not user friendly. And, even after spending the time to learn how to use it, I found it to be superficial and mind numbing.I found the book Personal Finance for Dummies to be far more useful and practical to address my financial questions and planning."
5,very relaxing,"This is a great CD to listen to on a rainy summer night, sitting on the front porch with a bottle of wine. Warm, homey, sexy, and totally relaxing."
5,Welcome to the studio of the Grey Ghost,"This album is probably Karen's and OTR's most moving, personal albums ever. The title track is soft and amazing - even though it's amazingly under-produced and the arrangement is pretty basic. Other amazing tracks (all of them really) include, ""Spark,"" ""Bluer,"" ""Drunkard's Prayer,"" and ""Who Will Guard the Door?""I've seen OTR four times in concert and everytime they continue to amaze me. Karen is SO down to earth and was very chatty with me afterwards the entire time.Another strong recommendation is OTR's ""Ohio"" - a double album with tons of beautiful songs ~ [...]"
3,"Great vocals, good to great lyrics, but the music needs help","Karin is a great vocalist and I do enjoy the lyrics in this album and their prior efforts. However, unless they look elsewhere for someone to write the music to their songs, they are destined to have a just a small cult following. The music to most of their songs falls into the pleasant-but-generic category and often the only thing that lifts the songs out of mediocrity is Karin's voice. Not everyone is a jack of all trades. Linford and Karin are a musician and a vocalist respectively and they should accept the fact that they need to outsource the song writing duties. Sorry for being so harsh."
5,Soulful and stirring,"This music surprised me with its soul and sound. My friend saw the band in concert and told me how they talked about coming to the table with a bottle of wine and two glasses and working out some things in their marriage and working out this album. Now maybe that is not exactly the story, but it was a great story and i bought the CD. Every time I play the music....at parties, in the background, in class...people always stop mid-sentence and say, Who is singing? GET THIS CD. AT LEAST ONE COPY. It is one of those CDs you can give to a friend and be certain they love it."
2,allergic reaction,"Consult with your doctor before taking this product. I purchased some last week and was taking as directed, after 5 days I have broken out in a rash on my arms and chest cavity. I have since stopped taking the product. I'm not sure why I had this allergic reaction since I am otherwise healthy. I also purchased a soap that contains Neem among other ingredients which I just received today, and the Neem salve which I haven't received yet. I will consult with my doctor before trying the topical treatments for fear I may have the same reaction."
3,Not too sure...,"We got mites on our honeymoon, and have been struggling to get rid of them ever since! This was recommended on a few websites as a remedy. We also applied the oil to our skin. The combo helped the itching, but they didn't die. :o("
3,Hard to read,This book assumes that the reader is already up to speed on many terms and religious ideas in the movements. I found this book did not clearly state the different views of the churches in a way you could realize they were different. Information is scattered.Lots of good info. Lots of details. Inspiring.
5,Coaching & Mentoring for Dummies,"This is a great ""how to"" book. It has plenty of ""laundry lists"" that all coaches must keep in mind at all times. It is one of the most comprehensive coaching books that I've seen for a long time. This ""on my desk"" book is guarranted to have plenty of high-liteing and dog-ears within a short period of time. This is a must for new or seasoned coaches and coaches-of-coaches."
3,Not pleased,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband. First of all when it arrived the box it was in was a wreck..this could have happened during shipping...anyway, I thought a power source came with it...wrong...one of the tightening screws(thumb screw) was missing as was a tube sleeve. I am very disappointed with this. I have always had a good experience with Amazon but not the case with this order...also I have tried to contact the seller to no avail! Not a happy customer at this point."
1,Casio Review,"There are so many things wrong with this product. The size is too big if you don't have a stand, there are 36 keys and an average piano/keyboads has 88. The DC is too short, it takes too many batteries. It's not worth the $70. If you going to spend close to $100 on a piano/keyboard, make it worth the money."
1,Keyboard,"This product was a birthday gift for my son and it doesn't work. No, power cord was included so I bought batteries and it still doesn't work. I feel cheated!"
1,My son loved it!,"I gave this to my 5 year-old son for Christmas and he loves it. It inspired an interest, no obsession, with music. He now takes piano lessons and practices, without being asked, for a least an hour a day. This keyboard has taught him all his chords and he figured out the accompaniments on his own. He would be lost without it. And so would I. Thsi is a great tool for kids and adults to learn on and much more."
5,You'll listen to it again...,"...and again, and find something new every time. Every song on this album shines with originality and humor. ""A Load of Blues"" was what originally sold me, with it's clever play on words and beautiful imagery, but I soon discovered that it is impossible to pick a favorite song. ""Don't Open the Door,"" and ""Blood Reunion"" are fun and funny. ""The Sisters of St. Timothy"" approaches the idea of child abuse from a haunting angle, and the music is just a little off of innocent, which augments the picture the words create.All in all, this is a stunning album which everyone should buy and listen to repeatedly."
5,A great knife,"I recieved this knife for Christmas, and have been using it regularly since then. It's easily become my favorite knife. Comfortable to hold, retains its sharpness, and comfortably heavy.I don't take nearly as good care of it as I should, (it's often left unwashed or soaking for long periods of time), and after 4 months of use, it's still very sharp.Now whenever I cook at another house without a furi or global knife, I feel like something's missing."
2,Not so good.,Overall this knife is just OK. It rusts easily and doesn't hold a very good edge. It doesn't compare to other quality knife brands.
4,They've worked perfectly for my application,"I just use them in blinky bike lights, and they hold their charge for a long time, unlike other rechargeables. You can put them into something that you rarely use, and when you come back to it, they will have held their charge, unlike other rechargeables, which tend to lose about 3% of their charge per day.However, they don't seem to work well in high-current-demanding applications, like an old analog camera to operate the flash.So recognize that these batteries have their purpose, but they won't work well everywhere."
3,Interesting,A good source for facts not available (or hard to find) about indians of southern new england after KPW. Not particularly well organized or well written. Sometimes hard to follow.
4,Classic Locked Room Mystery,"King Bendigo was the head of a powerful family-run company, with his own island kingdom. Ellery and his father are hired to keep him from being killed after a series of anonymous notes announces his impending murder.The good:The mystery. It's a logic puzzle of a mystery, the kind Ellery Queen is rightly famous for.The take-over-the-world conspiracy is a fun bonus.The bad:The murder, the solution, and the conspiracy are all over-the-top, but that's part of the series charm.The verdict:Don't expect in-depth characterization, and don't be surprised that it's dated (it's copyright 1952, after all). Just relax and enjoy a little mental puzzle."
3,Intel mainboard LGA 775,"I cannot wite a comment for this item, I never receive it to install in my computer. This should be removed from my account"
3,Great selection if you stick with the classics!,"As noted in other reviews, two tracks definitely don't belong on this cd..the producers could have had an amazing compilation but had to be trendy."
4,To Answer Your Question....,"The movie was great, the soundtrack is great. The song playing when Mel walks in on his daughter and her boyfriend is FatBoy Slim/Groove Armada ""I see you babe"". Its a fantastic song...dont know what album its on, but you can download it. Glad to have helped!!"
4,Nice overall,"However, some of the selections can feel a little jarring; specifically, tracks 5 (Bitch) and 10 (What a Girl Wants). They're great songs on their own, but everything surrounding them is classic 60s pop and it's a little startling to be jolted from the smooth sound of Sinatra to Meredith Brooks' harder modern beat. It breaks the mood.However, all the songs on this disc are lovely, particularly if you're in a romantic-comedy mood to begin with. And, unlike many soundtracks, all these songs can be enjoyed out of context with the film. For a quality selection of classics, old and new, you can't go wrong with ""What Women Want."""
5,"""What Women Want"" CD",This CD arrived much sooner than expected. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed the music from the movie. I would recommend this CD for everyone who enjoys good music!
4,Not for your grandpa,"It was a nice mix for me, but some of the newer songs would probably be too offensive to an elderly person."
4,Killer soundtrack with a few cold spots,"Sammy Davis, Tony Bennett, Nancy Wilson, the incomparable Lou Rawls, and of course, the man himself, Frank...how could you go wrong with such an all-star line-up? Well, for the most part the compilers of this soundtrack hit the nail right on the head. But I'm with those who feel that the newer songs (Christina Aguilera and Meredith Brooks) fell short of the sheer musical firepower laid down by the others. On the whole, though, an excellent CD well worth the buy."
4,very happy with this trash can!,"I was looking for a tall, sleek trash can for my modern kitchen that would take up little room. I went to my local housewares storeand compared all available floor models. While I preferred a can that was more like 30 inch tall with at least a 20 gallon capacity, I soon found that no one makes a can that size in a contemporary finish. (except the hands free options which I hear malfunction quite a bit) I chose this model because of it's 26 in tall 19 in. wide size and trash capacity. It is also, a step on can, and has a very sleek modern look which I like. Simple human also seems to have a good reputation for quality made goods. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is rather steep--it's an investment for sure and I do find that the simple human bags work best with the can so be prepared to shell out for those. So far, I really like it though, if it lasts for years it will be more than worth the price."
4,Great Can,"Very nice clean looking can. Only two complaints. If you position can right up against wall, you will slam the top of the can in it when you open it. Also can is ""designed"" to be a tad too large for regular 13gal bags. This means it is a stretch to put bags on. Guess what... Simplehuman sells bags that fit just right. ;) Go figure. Other than that absolutely ridiculous attempt to make more money off their customers this is a great can."
5,love it,"this works wonderful, had been through 3 trash cans in the 2 years. Even with a 1 year old and 3 year old it is easy to clean and keeps them out of it."
5,Excellent trash bin,"Beautiful, well designed, built and operating trash can. Amazingly the finger print-proof finish lives up to its name. I don't understand other reviewers comments with bag fit. Use the J size simplehuman bags and there will be no issue. They're reasonably priced, especially if you buy them in bulk lots of 100 or 200. Great can, great bags."
4,"Great trash can, but dinged in shipping","This is a great trash can and I ordered two, but when they arrived there was just the original manufacturer's box, which isn't padded, and one of them had a dent in the side. Oh well. I ordered the 10 gallon ones and they shipped the 13 gallon ones, so who am I to complain? I just put the dented side against the wall and no one can tell the difference.The trash can is great though... I love the stainless steel and the slow-close feature is fantastic."
5,"So far, so good.",This can is a perfect size. The pedal mechanism works well. The top opens to 90 degrees so the lid isn't at an angle over the can when opened. I actually thought I was buying a different model and was disappointed when this arrived. When I saw how much better this worked than cans where the entire lid lifts (but not completely) I was mollified. I'm always soiling the top of my other can when I put things in and would love to replace it with one like this.
5,Pleased!,I would recommend this trash can. It is high quality and it looks great in my kitchen. This trash can exceeded my exceptions.
4,Overpriced,"If you want to buy this product, please look at the Simple Human website - their price for the CW1816 is $179.99! It does not say its on sale, and there is no price of $255 to be seen....buyer beware....Perhaps Amazon could review its pricing of this product please...?"
5,Wonderful trash can!,"My husband could not believe that I spent over $100 on a trash can, but I was tired of the broken pedal and the marks on the wall from the lid of our old trash can. I LOVE this new trash can. Totally worth the money. I got the 10-gallon one, and have had no problems using regular tall drawstring trashbags. The bag stays in, does not stick out the edges, and the lid opens and closes smoothly and quietly without slamming into the wall or back down on your hand."
5,Great Product,"This is a great trash can. It hold allot more than my old 13 gallon can.The foot pedal is nice and big to open the top easily. The top closes quietly.So far, no problems."
3,Simplehuman Step Trash Can rectangular 10 gal stainless steel,"Very nice trash can, but way over priced. It easily dents. Everything else works great."
4,Consider the width,"This can is almost 20"" wide. From the picture, I hadn't really understood how big this can was going to seem in my kitchen. I'd say you should go measure out the space in your kitchen before buying. Otherwise, it is a very good trashcan."
5,A garbage can?,"I'm writing a review about a garbage can? Really?The unit is good looking, durable, and well designed. Bags install quick and easy and the inside stays clean. The small ""airhole"" allows the bag to fully expand, and you will actually fill a 13 gallong bag with this trash can, there is little to no wasted space. Peddle action is solid and slow/controlled decent of lid is nice. My family hasnt been gentle with it and still there are no dings or marks on it.This is a lot of money to spend on a trash can, but I am throroughly pleased with it, and would purchase again. Nice too see quality products are still made."
4,free for all,its a good ted nugent album but it an even better find for the meatloaf fan. as meat does the vocals on several tracks. any meatloaf music (pre bat out of hell) on cd is next to imposible to find . this is good 70's stuff right on par with the stoney and meatloaf album not avliable on cd.
3,Retro Metal,"A good album to listen to when I want to get nostalgic about high school.(That's a good thing) Compared to today's European metal sound, it sounds kind of simplistic, but Ted always was straight ahead rock. Classic early Ted."
4,Strong album!,"Ted Nugent hits the mark on this one, the follow-up to his exceptional self-titled debut. While ""Free-for-All"" doesn't strike me as as big a hit as ""Cat Scratch Fever,"" on the album of the same name which came just a year after this one, the album is altogether more successful in its songwriting and performances. From front to back, it's a strong rock album, with ""Writing on the Wall"" offering the same brand of atmospheric rock as ""Stranglehold,"" and other songs just reflecting a high energy approach to rock n' roll. An altogether good, and enjoyable album."
2,little known,Here is an album that has several songs sung by Meat Loaf. This is the way he was meant to sound. Outstanding.
4,"Good, cute movie","I personally liked this movie, a couple of years ago I watched the movie over and over again, because it was one of my favorite movies. Now I still like it, it is a very cute, funny movie."
3,Cute kids flick,"not the greatest movie ever but, somethign good to atch on a sat arvo with the kids."
3,PRETTY COOL!,"I first this movie on HBO and I thought it was okay,so I bought it.Now since I'm older I think it went from a 5 to a 3.Trust me,this movie is cool!And I still enjoy it,just not that much.Grover's parents are breaking up.Thanks to Grover's friend Matt,he gets this crazy idea,to lock his parents in the basement to work there problems out.After Grover tells Matt,the biggest bully,T.J hears the conversation and decides to help.Now Grover and his little sister,are in trouble.Matt's parents,and T.J's parents also get locked down below.Then the most popular girl in school,Brooke,also locks her mom down there so she would get out of her hair and dress and talk her age.Now the group of kids must save there parents before the police and the noisey nieghbor Cheif Rocco find out there plan."
2,"another ""kids-think-they-know-it-all"" movie","the kids in this movie are totally annoying.especially grover.all the kids think they know everything.but it had Jamie Lee Curtis,and that made the movie a little bit better,when the kids werent in those scenes and it was only the adults which are good at acting.and it had jennifer tilly too."
1,Fun...to make fun of,"Truly awful. How the heck did this kind of cast get sucked intothis kind of movie? Humor falls flat, acting is weak, etc. Go get adifferent movie."
1,Kind of annoying!,I use to think it was a cool movie when I first saw it a few times but then I started to get sick of it. The kids in the movie started to get noisy and annoying and I just wanted to turn off the TV. It's not a bad movie but it comes on HBO every once in awhile and that what gets annoying about it.
1,"I like Comedys and Horror Movies, but this is one BAD Movie","Yikes, talk about wasted talent! Jam ie Lee Curtis, JLH there all wasting talent on a horrible movie."
1,Book is not the size stated in the ad.,"This book measures only 2 3/4"" x 4 1/2"" Other than that, it seem O.K. Nice leather cover, but not what I thought I ordered."
4,A helpful history of post-Huey Long Louisiana.,"While the author's virulent anti-Long bias is evident throughout the book, Long himself disappears after the first hundred or so pages. This book is most valuable in providing an explanation of what happened in Louisiana after Long's death, i.e. how the men he surrounded himself with were unable to build on his legacy (due mainly to their own criminal natures). Read against T. Harry Williams' ""Huey Long,"" a balanced picture of the man would probably emerge."
1,not like it at all,"The most frustrating movie, leave you keep wondering what was the big idea, and why anybody would think that watching a kid suffer is funny. Idiotic parents work so hard every night entertaining clients, that they are ready to leave their kid with anybody. He is supposed to be a good puppy and stay put, while mom and dad make money to pay for lexus and a big house. That is exactly what is wrong with the modern world. The kid learns a lesson that being bad or being good does not matter, because his parents are going to do what they want anyway. As a mother I felt frustrated, and they call this movie comedy. Spare your time, do not bother even wasting your evening on this film"
2,Quite a let down,"I used to be quite a big fan of the Eels. problem is that E seemed to have run out of creative ideas around Daisies of the Galaxy.He seems like a parody of himself these days.There's are maybe 3 or 4 songs on this double album which make me feel emotional. When compared with a brilliant album like Electro - Shock blues this is like a cheap, boring imitation.Electro Shock made me cry, this just makes me bored.His obsession with the musical ""square"" of melody... it's 4 chords 1,2,3,4 you listen and you can hear it in almost every song he writes. It's most obviously shown on the single ""Mr. E's beautiful blues"". It's like a loop and for some reason he uses it all the time.ANYWAY. I must say... even though this is certainly not a 4 or 5 star album, it is a hell of a lot better than ""SHOOTENANNY""."
5,Eels does it again,"I'm sure at this point we're all familiar with the songs from this CD set. I bought it for a couple of songs in particular, but was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the songs were excellent. There are just a couple that I can't seem to get into...but all in all this is a very nice compilation."
4,Promise fulfilled,"It's taken E several years and albums to fulfill the promise of the great Electro-Shock Blues. Whereas on Electro-Shock E was struggling with the emotional wreckage of his father's sudden death, sister's suicide, and mother's long illness and passing, this is the work of a mature musician making peace with his history."
5,Just listen to it several times,"I own all the albums by eels and would not like to compare them one by one with this. I just would like to write about this album. I bought it last week and already listened the whole thing twelve times, which is a record taking into account I own about 1000 albums.I can assure to the potential buyer that this is an excellent work by Mr. E; very personal, very touching and very funny (just sometimes).Listen to it several times and It will grow on you."
1,Luckily I found it on sale,"I like the eels and I hate to give them a single star, but this album was just a disaster. Luckily I found it on sale for $10 and I can see why. You see, when I first purchase a new album I always try to listen to it all the way through, but this was kind of painful. I kept impatiently waiting to hear one good rock song out of the 35 or whatever slow and boring tracks that all sound the same. I heard somebody refer to it as E's ""musical square of melody""...but I just call it repetitive failure. That was kind of harsh. I understand that it deals with life and death- particularly those in his family, but, in my opinion, it just didn't seem to measure up to E's previous work."
3,Decent,"I miss the swanky swing of Electro-shock blues, and the same with the raspy vocals.I expected more from such a great band."
2,Double-Album is Big Disappointment,"After being blown away by ""Shootenanny!"" and ""Souljacker"", I was let down to hear what an underachievement ""Blinking Lights"" is. Though its size and scope weigh it down, the quality of the songs is ultimately what makes it a bad record.I would probably have been excited to hear these songs if this album came after ""Beautiful Freak"". At that point this record would have been growth, but after we've all see the progress made on the last two albums, ""Blinking Lights"" seems painfully elementary.The sparseness of the record hurts it as well, as the entire product is an exercise in the miserable self-pity E is famous for; the problem is that the music and writing isn't enough to carry the same old ideas E has been singing about since the band began.The standout on this record is, ""If You See Natalie"", and sadly, you could count its peers on one hand. I'm a huge Eels fan, but this record is a letdown."
2,These Songs Aren't Very Good (and other observations),"Most double albums, of course, would benefit from some pruning and be far more successful as single albums. And then there are some double albums that are so lousy with bad songwriting, noodling instrumentals, and bland filler that they would have to be edited down to, say, EP size before the good would effectively outweigh the bad. Or I guess you could just throw ""Shootenany!"" in the CD player instead and pine for the old days...."
2,Not for me,"I bought the album out of pressure from friends. They all loved the album, but it was not for me.Buy Son Volt's ""Okemah and the Melody of Riot"""
5,from the heavens,this is some of the most beautiful music ever heard. from the heart and soul. we dont hear music like this much anymore
4,Blinking Lights And Other Revelations,"Blinking Lights And Other Revelations is a very strange and wonderful concept album. Is it a pop album, instrumental or just experimental? For me it is an album that is hard to define as we get so many different genres on it. I must say that even though the book-let is very strange it is also very nice with personal photos taken from family photos. The lyrics are intensly personal and heavy with emotions. Hey Man is a really good track. The lyrics are so right on how you feel after having been depressed. It is like coming out of darkness and starting to live again. It is something that has to be experienced to completely understand the feeling. Dust of ages is also a track that I like alot. This record was a very nice surprise indeed and I will listen to more of Eels. 4/5."
4,A Challenge that may sit on the shelf for years before being really appreciated.,"I first heard of the Eels (here in Sydney, Australia) through their radio ""hit"" ""Beautiful Day"" and wrote them off as a second rate retro-sounding post-Beck- commercial-MOR soft rock act. (NB Commercial radio is [...] here in Australia, but sometimes I am forced to listen to it at work.) OK the song was catchy but I assumed if commercial radio was giving them attention the Eels had to be a sell-out.This album proves me dead set wrong on every count. These songs shine, yes there are some slower, emotionally wrought tunes that take repeated listenings to get into... This album could very well sit on the shelf until you are in the right frame of mind for it (after something awful happens to you, most likely) and then become your most played selection... Worth the money."
2,Dummies books not for Kindle...,"With most types of ""for Dummies"" books, you will be going back and forth throughout the book for recalling things that were discussed. Using any Kindle version is really not meant for these kinds of books, because unless you bookmark the specific areas of possible recall, you will waste allot of time backing up and going forward, a page at a time. So, if you buy a ""for Dummies"" book, buy the paper version. It is a whole lot easier to use. That's not saying that I don't enjoy using my Kindle Fire for regular reading, videos and music..."
2,Terrible,"I would recommend for beginners not to use this book. Even for me (a somewhat intermediate programmer), I had difficulty understanding what was being done and what it did. The example syntax is messy making it hard for readers to understand. There are better approaches for teaching PHP & Mysql."
4,Definitive.,"Roach's book is the definitive guide to climbing the 14,000' peaks in Colorado. His descriptions are more uniform than Borneman and Lampert, and with the release of the new edition in 1999, Roach's book also has the most helpful, detailed maps of all the main routes up the peaks."
5,An excellent guide to hiking Colorado fourteeners,"If you are into skiing Colorado fourteeners, you might want to check out the Dawson guides, but personally, this book by Gerry Roach is my favorite guide for climbing Colorado's 14,000 foot peaks. Gerry Roach's guidebook provides very good information about the relative difficulty of different hiking and climbing routes, good route maps, photographs of the peaks, and detailed route descriptions. His guidebook provides alternative routes for most of the peaks, and I like the way he lists his favorite routes as ""classics."" Gerry Roach's guidebook is also more economical than the Dawson guides."
1,Coordinates Incorrect,"The lat/long for the North Half Moon Creek Trailhead (pg 100) is incorrect. The book lists 39.1332 -106.4580. If you go there, you'll end up a couple miles south on 110-3A nowhere close to the trailhead. 39.1532 -106.4580 is closer to accurate. The coordinates for Mt. Massive trailhead look to be wrong as well. Most, if not all, of the route descriptions have coordinates. After noticing this mistake, I can't trust them. The book is still useful, but I have to give it 1 star because it claims to be ""known for accuracy"" and has GPS coordinates as a selling point."
5,Best 14er guide I've seen!,This guide has been very helpful in providing information and options for all the 14ers. I'm using it as part of my research in planning a trip to CO for our hiking club in 2013. Well worth the money!
4,Great and detailed guide.,"I purchased two of these books, both as gifts. The gist recipients commented that the book provided detailed and insightful information on the trails and hikes in the Colorado Mountains. Next time I will be planning a hike in CO, this guide will definitely be a useful planning tool."
5,Must Have.,This publication is a must have if your headed up high in Colorado. Will be a valuable resource for this Summer.
4,"good lessons, but a little too easy","I was expecting a book about a very bright, pre-teen, homeschooled girl to be at the reading level of, well, a very bright, pre-teen, homeschooled girl. My daughter read through the whole series in a week. I also found the plots to be a bit too simple. I think Gilbert Morris let us down this time. My daughter prefers the Mandie books by Leppard. I gave it 4 stars because my daughter enjoyed them and they are the first early chapter books we've seen about homeschoolers."
1,Another Bad (Useless) Product,"Who wants to create onto MPEG? not me.. who wants to fork out money for a camera that does not produce quality pictures and has a poor zoom.. not me..I guess for you video buffs, this might tide you over, but in the world of digital cameras, like computers, another camera will be coming out soon with better bells and whistles.Well, you can't avoid that right? But this camera is not even up to par in the first place, i'm sorry. I'll stick to a Kodak FUn saver before shelling out my hard earned money on this soon to be outdated Sony product.And I'm sorry, but Sony is not ""top of the line"" my friends, by any means. It's the K-Swiss of Electronics, the Jack In the Box, the K Mart, the... i could go on. Ok I will....its the New Orleans Saints of Electronics, the Butler, the John Ritter, the Dow Corning... anyways...NEEEEXT!"
5,The Miracle Worker DVD,"DeafBlind Week was at the end of June (in Australia), so it was worth watching. Did not expect it to be in black and white and it is an old movie. Proves deafblind people have an eager brain and have the need to learn like we all do. Teaches the need for patience and the will and passion to teach as well as the need for discipline (important aspects of teaching)."
1,a horror movie rip off just plain crappy,i hated this movie i hated the screenplay it was overacted as anything and the music and screaming makes it sound like a horror movie that chick who plays helen is creapy as anything and i just plain could'nt stand this movie or book dont make a mistake by seeing this -alex
5,Excellent read,This is a true story and one that we all can learn from. Very worth reading and telling others about as we all can learn from it.
1,will not work in my American made cd player.,Notice that this cd would not work on American made players should have been in BOLDER letters . Any European cd going to an American address should be questioned.
5,The Miracle Worker,"I saw this movie about 40+ years ago and it still carries the same strong message. This is a true story and should give readers/viewers great hope. Never give up or accept second best. My heroine is and always will be Annie Sullivan. She was not a quiter in any sense of the word!!!!!!! This movie/story should go into all homes. Carries a strong, great message.This movie arrived in good condition and exactly when I wanted it....very fast."
5,The Miracle Worker,"This movie was amazing. To bring a child from a dark and silent world is quite an accomplishment. Of course, Helen was a very bright child to begin with. She had her own way of communication, however limited it was. Being as she did not have these obstacles in her life since birth might have helped her in that area. A good view. A ""feel good"" movie. Comical elements kept it moving at a good pace. The black and white format did not distract from the theme of the movie. In fact, being as that is how it was filmed made it more valid."
5,Bancroft and Duke deliver!,"I believe this is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever seen! The movie is about an 7-year old blind,deaf,and mute child named Helen Keller. After numerous attempts to communicate with Hellen, the Kellers hire Annie Sullivan, a twenty year old teacher from Boston. Annie who is virtually blind herself, has an agressive, but meaningful approch to help Helen overcome her disablities. This movie truly does deliver. From the infamous dining room scene, to the heart wrenching finale. The acting is superb. By the way, Bancroft and Duke won Academy Awards. This is one of those movies that you can't just watch once. The more you watch it,the more you'll love it. I must admit, it's hard not to be emotional moved by this masterpiece which is ""One of the finest works of art in the history of motion pictures."" (Boxoffice)"
3,Miracle Worker,I was hoping it was someone else who stared in this as this seems a bit more dramatic for my 1-4 graders! I would have appreciated just a quick little clip of this movie before hand as I would have done more research before ordering it!!
3,The picture fooled me.,"I guess I was expecting a colorized version of the movie because of the picture displayed. I guess I'll pay attention next time, however the movie is the one I wanted."
4,May not be appropriate for young children,"I am a (...) teacher and my class just finished reading the Helen Keller story. They were so intrigued by the story that I wanted to show them the video, so they could really feel the story. As a child I remember watching this version of The Miracle Worker and I knew I could get it at our local video store. I prepared my class that this movie was not in color but in black and white. Unfortunately, I did not re-watch this version. The ""scarey"" sounding music was too intense for my class. It was difficult to really listen to the words. I felt I had to narrate the movie. After about 10 minutes, I could sense that my class was somewhat uncomfortable watching this version. They still would like to see the video and I promised them another version. I think for a school setting the Disney version is a better choice."
1,Small Image when played on a widescreen TV,"The DVD manufacturer did it again. When played on a widescreen TV, there is a big black bar all the way around the picture. The reason for this is the 16:9 image is in the middle of a 5:4 caption ratio frame. So, you still have to wait for the studios to produce this film in true widescreen full screen."
3,Not Satisfied,"The DVD ""The Miracle Worker"" staring Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke skips in places. I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back so I'll keep it. I thought I was actually ordering the one with Patty Duke and Melissa Gilbert."
4,we all need a good teacher,"Annie Sullivan invents a method of getting through to Helen Keller.At times this movie is very hard to watch, butwe rejoice at the end victory.Disease robbed the very young child of two of here sense, but not her mind or her energy.They result is a ""wild child"" of a very hard to control type.Teacher her the basics of language as ""feeling"" by hand deaf sign languagehas to be the hardest kind of teaching known to man."
5,Classic,This movie is a must have. Inspirational. Reflects the hopes of a good teach. Gives everyone hope.
5,genious,"There's so many bad children actors out there, that it's so refreshing to see Patty Duke in this film. The character she plays would be a challenge for many accomplished adult actors, but Patty was something special from the start. Together with Bancroft(who is also superb), they truly shine. Parents, turn off the garbage that is usually pouring into your kids brains from the television, and pop this delightful story into your DVD player Now!!!"
3,It's just ok,"Not really scary, but still interesting to watch. I do not think I would watch it again or recommend it as a scary movie."
3,can't fine stars,I looked this movie up on line & it said that Richard Jaeckel & Cathy Lee Crosby were in it but I could not find either one of them. I was wondering if anyone else did.
3,I was scared to death,"At first look, the title and the poster is reminiscent of B movie material....but noo was I wrong. The setting, the storyline, the sound effects and the directing was immaculate. Take it from me, I am a horror movie maniac, and I have disdainfully knighted myself as someone who is never really shocked anymore, but this movie was really a very disturbing surprise. Thats the right term, this movie was very disturbing for me."
1,what the ?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!,"What a load of absolute c***!!!! If anyone can tell me what the heck was going on with this film, please go ahead. I do not think I have ever seen such a bad, bad.....bad film in a long long time. Do not waste your time or money on this. Sponsor a Panda in your local zoo instead."
2,"HORRIBLE MOVIE, VERY CONFUSING","I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SISTER FOR HER BIRTHDAY BECAUSE SHE LOVES SEAN BEAN. LET ME TELL U, HER LOVING SEAN COULDN'T SAVE THIS MOVIE. WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE AND WAS VERY CONFUSING. I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL. IF YOUR A SEAN FAN GET IT TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION, BUT DON'T EXPECT ALOT FROM THIS MOVIE. IT LOOKS SCARY AND IT TOTALLY ISN'T, LETS YOU DOWN."
2,Recycled,"This movie is along the same lines as The Ring, and The Grudge. If you are fans of these movies then this one will make you very happy. It's thought provoking and has a good story, but I'm just tired of movies like this. There are a couple parts in the movie that make you think something else is going on but then it never goes back to those scences or never expound on them making you wonder why they are there in the first place as they end up having nothing to do with the ""horror"" if you couuld call it that."
2,This could have been great.,"With Sean Bean and Mario Bella in it, I was expecting a far better film. They are both excellent actors and I they were both brilliant in it but the script was all over the place and quite bland.Obvious J-horror influnces but this just didn't come together for me and left me bored and un-moved.Wish it was better."
4,CREEPY,"If you like films like the grudge, the ring, darkwater...stuff like that...Then you will enjoy this ghost story as well"
4,What 'Ring 2' Should Have Been....,"Fans of the Ring and the Grudge will find plenty to like here. Compelling story, excellent acting and directing. I found the story to be original and the ending surprising. Certainly better than most movies I have seen recently (ie:Hostel). A true Horror film in every way."
4,The Dark,"*The Dark* is an interesting movie. However, I found it, at times, to be a bit too slow for me.Anyways, Adele and her daughter, Sarah, come to the Wales to visit Sarah's father. However, Sarah drowns in the ocean and her body cannot be found. In the midst of Adele's mourning, Ebrill appears, who has an uncanny resemblence to Sarah.Ebrill explains that she, too, drowned at the ocean...60 year ago. The story around her drowning is both interesting and creepy. Believing that there's some connection between Ebrill and her daughter, Sarah, Adele goes off in an investigation with the hopes of rescuing her daughter. At the same time, people in town are mysteriously murdered. Just who is doing the killing?However, the question is will Adele ever find her daughter? Or was this all in her mind in the midst of her grieving? I cannot tell you. You just have to watch it.The storytelling is wonderful. I just wish it was faster. But the suspense...such a nice build-up."
3,pretty good,"Started out interesting, slowed some during the middle when the girl showed up, then started to pick back up. My problem is, unless I missed it, is that they never explained why the ghost girl was the way she was other than ""she brought something back"". Why did sheep die when she was around? The ending was okay if a bit abrupt. Who was the creepy guy shown in the last frame with the mother. Overall this was better and more thought out than the Ring. Pretty good, worth seeing once. Beautiful setting though."
3,LOOKING BACK TO SIMPLER TIMES,"Dylan Thomas' portrait of a 1950's Christmas in Wales is genuine and sweetly simple. Presented from a boy's viewpoint these 40 pages prove a nostalgic glimpse into bygone memories. Depicting adults--especially his relatives--Thomas has preserved his characters for all in the modern world to observe and possibly recognize (with a secret smile) in our own extended family. In an unplotted series of events over 24 hours he offers his juvenile stream of consciousness--without character development, subtle themes or heavy morality. Just childlike fun and judgment of people in the boy's limited world, plus his detailed responses to questions posed by an unnamed but curious personage. Trina Schart Hyman's snowflakes polkadot the charming color illustrations in this seasonal short read. Great to curl up with in a cozy armchair by a fire."
2,A Child's Christmas in Wales,"The printing is nice, of course, but the low rating is because the illustrations were very disappointing. We were replacing a printed version maybe 10 years old, which we misplaced before Christmas Eve when we always read the poem, and hoped this edition would have appealing illustrations, as the prior one did. And the New York Times imprimatur gave me hope for good illustrations in particular. There were no children with us, but we three adults thought the illustrations were dark, almost scary for children -- not joyful remembrances of good times in days gone by (at least not joyful to us). This is a disadvantage to ordering sight-unseen rather than actually looking at a book at a bookstore before purchasing it."
3,A Child's Christmas i Wales,"It is a delightful book but this edtion had too sall a font to be read by many people.easily, Childll's Christmas in Wales"
5,Wonderful book,"Loved this book as a child. Thrilled to see it is still available. I have now read it to my grandchildren and they can see where ""Nanny"" was born.Thanks for making it available."
3,mixed bag,"I ordered 2 copies of this little holiday gem, from 2 different sellers. One was 'very good' per the description, the other decidedly not. I kept the first, to give to a friend as a gift. The second looked like it was a refugee from a 'fire sale' though also described as very good. Can't recall the names of either seller though if I see them in print I certainly know who to avoid. That is all I can say except ""caveat emptor""."
4,A lovely book,"This is a good quality hardcover. It has a nice dust cover and is printed on thick, cream-coloured paper. The book is beautifully illustrated and there's an illustration on every page. The illustrations are in colour on every second page.The book is a perfect Christmas gift for a child, a parent or anyone who is young at heart."
4,Inspiring,I love the simpleness of this book. It's stuff I know and like reading it as a reminder of Life's joys. I found it inspiring!
4,RA one,Love it ! The movie was great and was shipped fast.Looking forward to ordering Don2 as well.The movie had cool special effects.
3,Ok,"It's ok, a great introductory story to a possible franchise series; special effects were great, but kinda reminds one of the iron man concept with the ""heart"" thing going. Has Chammak challo and other great songs like Dildara also a plus."
2,Not for our family!,"The disc was fine. We had high hopes for this techie-type SRK film! The acting was good. BUT...This is NOT a family film. It is scary. We like Bollywood movies...but this one got turned off. Violent. Creepy. Sexual Innuendo. This movie is Bollywood TRYING TO BE Hollywood. We expected extravagant from Eros, but not EVIL!"
3,Ra One - all about the videos,You'll find yourself waiting for the next music video because those are the best parts. Bought this to see the full Chammak Challo video. Nice.
4,A fun movie,"My kids words to describe this movie ""Cooool"". They loved all the special effects.This was very different from the traditional bollywood style of movies but I still enjoyed it. I'm also a huge SRK fan so maybe i'm a little biased but his acting was like always on point. The dance numbers were awesome they used Akon for some of the songs which came as a surprise for me but it was pulled off very well since the songs are all very catchy. There was comedy and heartfelt moments mixed with tons of action."
3,"A MILDER ""EYES WIDE SHUT""","I always enjoy it when someone tells me about a film maker who I should look out for. After learning about Visconti I took it upon myself to rent his films. And this is the first one I rented. The film is filled with lavish sets,wonderful cinematography, and great acting from each character. But Visconti on the other hand seems to be a director who doesn't seem to demand too much from his actors. His directing style seems very tenuous. He doesn't seem to take control of his actors. Which is a much different feeling I get when I watch Bergman or Kurosawa. All in all Visconti made a very interesting film. It may seem a bit slow,but carries your interest untill the end."
2,L'Innocente DVD,Poor quality and unable to view english subtitles. I was disappointed in this DVD. I am a fan of Giancarlo Gianni and this is one of his worst movies. Would not recommend it.
4,Life's Rich Tapestry,"Visconti is THE visual master. This decadent, fin de siecle oevre is not only a farewell to the aristocracy, but to Visconti's own life. Giancarlo Giannini gives a strong, visceral performance as a Nietzschean superman, living beyond good and evil. Laura Antonelli offers a subtle and nuanced performance. This would have been a five star film had Visconti been able to complete editing before his death."
1,Let down by bad editing,"Admittedly this is primarily an art book, but that is simply no excuse. Certainly, the paintings, mainly by Linda and Roger Garland are beautiful. As a coffee table book, it is perfectly acceptable. But upon reading the text by Nigel Suckling (and goodness knows who edited) my estimation of this book dived rather sharply. The stories themselves are lucid, colourful and well told, but the entire book is let down by a number of errors in punctuation, grammar and spelling. Twice, sentences are actually left unfinished, dropped midway through. I paid almost $50 for this book, and expected more than the amateurish job it delivered. Don't bother."
4,Not for a hugh family but for the size it is nice! I use 13 gal Hefty bag,"I ended up getting mine for $59 at bed, bath and beyond. I This is a 30 liter can with the stainless steel top. I'm upgrading from a ""way to small"" under the sink trash bin. This can is supposed to hold 8 gallons. I'm giving this a 4 star because standard bags in the US are not the same size as Liters. I'm using hefty's 13 gal draw string bags. Whenever I empty my trash I always end up putting something else into the bag so I'm not wasting the extra space. I really wanted the 45 liter can with the butterfly opening but it is priced around $179 and I couldn't justify the cost. This brand is good. Simplehuman has a nice liner, and opens and closes nicely so you really don't have hold the lid open. No smell and you don't have to touch your own trash. My kitchen can't accomodate an under the sink trash bin, so this do nicely. BTW the stainless steel ones with the bag-ring holders will drive you crazy. You get what you pay for."
1,broke after the FIRST week,I finally bought myself a nice expensive garbage can. It looked and worked perfectly for a week. But now I'm guessing the pedal broke and the lid doesn't open or shut properly. I don't have any children in my home and have only used this garbage can in my kitchen.
2,"Good looking, but not durable","Bought this trash can about 5 years ago. It is a good looking trash can and is sized just right for me. However, the pedal mechanism is broken, like several other reviewers have noted. For what this trash can costs, it is ridiculous that it has such a short life span. The pedal mechanism has several high stress areas and the plastic used by Simplehuman just doesn't cut it. For the price paid, it should have been metal. I would NOT recommend this model. Now I know what to look for on the new trashcan I will soon be shopping for...."
1,Defective can. Aweful warranty policy,"I bought this can from Bed, Bath and Beyond two months ago. Last week the stepping mechanism broke through just normal use. The manufacturer has a '5 year' warranty on this model. However, on their website, the say that you must enclose a check for $16.50 for return shipping. This is an addition to the $15-20 its going to cost me to return it. All in all I will have to pay an additional $36 for a defective can. I would advise any potential buyer NOT to buy this. The whole stepping mechanism is very flimsy!!"
2,Looks good but flimsy and dents easily,I bought mine at Target. It seemed the perfect size for a family of four (we recycle so we don't need a can that will hold large soda bottles and empty cereal boxes). It also looked good enough to keep in plain sight in the kitchen. I soon discovered that it dents easily and the dents can't be pounded out completely. It's also flimsy for a trash can that costs over $60. I'm returning mine.
1,The step on thing allows small toes to get CAUGHT!,The step on thing allows small children's toes to get CAUGHT in it!Very Dangerous if you have small children!
3,Nice looking Trash Can but small,I bought this thinking it would be an upgrade to my plastic trash can. It is however I am regretting not buying the larger rectangulartrash can b/c this one is not that large since it is has a narrow round shape. This can cannot use regular grocery shopping bags since it is too tall and there is nothing to hold the bag up. I use the tall kitchen bags from BJs. Nice but I would have been happier with the rectangular one since that would allow me to fill up the entire trash bag. This one is narrow so I feel like I am wasting a large bag with it.Quiet step close. You can also keep the lid up if you pick it up manually.
2,He should have stuffed his thong.,"Well I can appreciate a good mockery any day but a full set was way to much. I too saw him in San Diego, but don't worry I won't post this 4 times.He's a talented singer; I'll give him that. He has balls (little ones from the looks of his undies) I'll give him that. But cheesy white boy R&B is funny for a quick laugh not entertaining for a full album, unless you are a fan of white boy R&B. I get just as many laughs when I hear R Kelly's lyrics."
3,Just basics,Is a practical but simple book. If the porpouse was education studentds or first year resident is excellent.Other wise the book is over rated.
4,A pearl in itself,I really like how each chapter is a case study. I find it easier to remember something if I have something to relate it to. This book does just that.
3,Three Stars for three good stories.,"I gave this book three stars, one for each good story in here. If you did not get enough of the Underdark from Salvatore's fantastic drow series, then this book is worth it for the three quality stories within. Though none of the stories are of the quality of Salvatories writings about the underdark, three out of five stories in here add nicely to the myth of the Underdark. The Liriel Baenre story is the best of them and even features a brief appearance by my favorite drow Jarlaxle. There is an excellent story about a deep gnome who was captured as a drow slave. And then there is the so-so Zaknefin story, which includes some more back story on Drizzt, and while this story is no where near the quality of Salvatories writing, it does provide some interesting insight into both Zaknefin and Drizzt. As for the other two stories in here, forget about them, I already did."
3,"Good, but a little repetative.","I like this song, I love the album ""Temperamental"" but the mixes did'nt have a lot of variety to them. Good, but not great."
5,Informed and comprehensive,"This provides a comprehensive coverage of the subject in an informed manner. It reads like a school textbook on the subject (though this is in no way intended to be a criticism) and has, indeed, been selected by the Department of Education in India for university libraries. It quotes very extensively from the works of Ken Wilber. It is thus particularly useful if you wish to acquaint yourself with the latter's work but, like me, find him not particularly readable.Dennis Waite, author of Back to the Truth: 5000 years of Advaita"
4,Not the best for volume control ...,"I bought these headphones on the spur of the moment. I was leaving for vacation and needed some cheap headphones. These headphones certainly were a bargain. Not only is the price great, but they are quite comfortable and the swiveling earphones are great when storing them. The only problem is the volume control. It is very touchy. My suggestion is to just keep it on the mid-setting and use your CD player's volume control."
1,"Good sound, but CHEAP plastic!!","Mine broke within two weeks, the right headphone started to rotate a full 360 degrees when it should have been only 45 degrees. I thought crazy glue would help but they broke again, soon the week after same thing happened to the other one. Tried using crazy glue again for nothing, three weeks later the right headphone broke completely (a thin piece of plastic that holds it to the metal rotating piece just broke). Needless to say these were trash, and perhaps too big for the design. Had they been smaller they would have survived. I yet have to send them to see if KOSS would honor their lifetime warranty. Very dissatisfied, I paid thrice what they sell here since I bought them downtown and was in a hurry to get headphones that day, very disappointed."
4,GREAT TV HEADPHONE,"This is a great headphone for TV. Have used a couple of them over the past year. The volume control is a necessary item with some TVs. The volume control on this item is too range sensitive but it serves the purpose. Sound eficiency and quality is very good. I have yet to find the headphone tiring or uncomfortable over extended use periods. The headband has broken just above the swivel but is easy to repair/fix. This is an open-air model, which is desirable for TV use. The Koss KTX6 headphone is hard to beat for TV watching."
3,Ok but mine broke,I liked the scound Quality and the volume control. The problem i had was that the twist part broke and one of the plastic parts that holds the speaker peice broke. They were in my backpack which gets beat up alot and i had them for about 6 mounths. They are probably the best headphones you can buy for 5 bucks.
3,"Not great, but worth a look","I think a lot is lost in translation of movies, both with emotions and continuity. Nevertheless, I found this movie charming and entertaining, enough to keep me awake to read the subtitles. And I saw this BEFORE I saw Amelie. It really is a cute film with a good storyline."
1,Aspect Ratio Abortion,"I hate this sort of deceptive DVD.The box says that the movie is in its proper aspect ratio of 1.85, but only the titles are 1.85.The Rest of the movie is in Full screen 1.33.This means, of course, that part of the director's vision has been arbitrarily hacked away and discarded.A pox on the adulterators of cinema art!"
3,Love Audrey,"Although Audrey did well as usual, this movie was just okay with me. Had its moments of romance, but could have been better."
4,it's cute and funny... not too bad,"This movie is hilarious for one and second it is just a cute take on life of the women that frequent this beauty spa.It is a social critique on fashion and beauty in French society as well as others. It's a funny movie, a lot of humor and freshness.The plot can be slow and the characters lack dynamism.The love story with the main character is a bit odd to follow and the ending is odd. You think at the end the finance will change the story's pace and outcome, but it's not that evil.It's defin entertaining despite it's lack of depth. It's humorous and worth the time for this cute french movie."
2,Disappointing,"It was ok, but i found myself loosing interest in this movie as i watched it. Wouldn't recommend if you are an Audrey T. fan. She is not the main character."
2,"A boring, pointless film","Boy these Amazon Editorials are inconsistent! After seeing Amelie I rushed out to see everything else that Audrey Toutau has done. I think she's absolutely adorable. However, avoid this one. First of all, despite the cover, she's barely in it (maybe for 5 minutes). The main female lead is unlikable. Although there are a few (very few) moments of humor, this film is a complete waste. There's really no beginning, middle, or end. I was so disappointed in this!"
1,So Annoying,"This is the second AT&T cordless phone w/caller ID that I've bought, and I think after this experience, I'm going to switch to a new brand. Here's why:1. When I press the phone button to answer a call, it doesn't answer right away. I sit there saying ""hello?"" for a good 10-20 seconds every time before the connection is made. I checked; it's not the phone line.2. The buttons are too small.3. You can only store 10 numbers in memory (my previous model stored 50).4. Erasing caller ID entries is more complicated then it needs to be. I don't want to have to press the buttons a million times.5. Turning off the ringer used to be an option in the menu. Now you have to remember which number key it is.All in all, this phone is much more trouble than it's worth."
1,Most uncomfortable phone I've ever owned,"I know that since the break-up of Ma-Bell, nobody takes any time to design phones for comfort or useabilility, but it seems to me that the designers of this phone went out of their way to make it as uncomfortable as possible. I've had it out of the box for about an hour now, and its going right back where it came from. Pass this one by!"
3,Cypress delivers a solid live performance,"After over a decade in the rap game, Cali's Cypress Hill offer fully-charged live cd for your listening pleasure. Unlike many rap acts, Cypress tours extensively and makes the most out of both the studio and the stage. Their original talent shines through on Live at the Fillmore.The Hill performs nearly all of their classic joints; ""Pigs"", ""How I Could Just Kill a Man"", and of course ""Insane in the Brain"". The songs sound pretty good overall, but if you are only into the ""perfect-sounding"" studio albums, then you may be disappointed in this take-it-or-leave-it record. At times the vocals and guitar become a tug-of-war, but overall, the songs work on this cd."
3,Hits from the stage.,"""Live At The Fillmore"" confirms my thought that live rap albums just don't really work. Even with the great Cypress Hill this only comes off as ok for fans. I initially had high hopes for this disc because the tracklist is killer. I wish the ""Greatest Hits"" album had these songs. And while this is still decent, soundwise it just doesn't have the impact that the albums do. Mid-way through the songs all start to sound the same. This is something the fanatic will probably love, but otherwise I'd say stick with the first three albums, and maybe ""Skull & Bones""."
4,.....cypress....still up the hill!,..this is one of the greatest live albums eve.....r....so you gotta buy it....the sound and voices are kinda.....scavenger or something...that's right this is a great hip hop band..but...they can turn crazy all the crowd just like any metal band....sen dog sounds kinda rude but funny.....and b real just awesome.....oh my gawd is awesome!!the only bad thing is that they didn't play any song from temples of boom.....that was really <bad>....some anyway buy it sucka!
2,Nice trash in bad shape,"William K. Everson featured this movie, together with the superior Strangler of the Swamp, in his excellent book about classic horror films. But it isn't really exciting - no rediscovered treasure from the B movie backlot. Image's version differs from the vhs tape offered by SONY in recent years, but at least the soundtrack hasn't much to offer, while the print is worn and very dark. While I would recommend Strangler of the Swamp, issued together with this one, as being a real attraction for genre fans, this one is too silly and slow of pace. One point for Alexander Steinert's heavy-handed score, and one more for Rosemary LaPlanche."
5,Baha'i philosophical /historical view,"The explanation section of the cover states that it is a ""Christian response to Baha'ism,,,"" In this response, Beckwith shows that the Baha'i religion is based on numerous self-contradictory elements. these elements are well-footnoted and explained. In reading the other reviews it is interesting to note how the critics constantly mention ""false' or ""incorrect"" statements, yet they fail to present even one of them for review. The question is not whether or not this book places the Baha'i faith in a bad light, or is a polemic against the faith. The question is whether or not what Beckwith writes is true and/ or is substantiated--and none of the reviewers here seem to offer any legitimate evidence."
1,Not An Objective Analysis,"There are much better books that look at the Baha'i Faith from a Christian perspective. This is a simple polemic against the Baha'i Faith. Unfortunately, it takes Baha'i scripture badly out of context and the analysis is illogical at times. Do not be fooled by the fact that the book is written by an professor. This is a badly informed essay in which the author does not even attempt an objective analysis."
1,Beckworths book Is poorly researched.,"What research that has been done has been done for this book has been done from the point of view of someone who has made up their mind before writing anything and used very selective sources, the majority of which have been shown to be enemies of the Faith."
1,Francis Beckwith Still Missed the Mark!,"The problem that I have with so called ""experts"" is that there are no ""experts"". ""Expert"" would imply that the individual would have knowledge that is unfettered by a prejudiced opinion prior to the investigation of the subject. Dr. Beckwith is probably a very intellegent individual and as such has the ora of the ""know-it-all"". But, I'm afraid that his credibility is lacking. And, I fear, the panel of interviewers who reviewed his thesis. Were any of these panel members athiest? Were any of them Baha'is? Or were they all just a group of choir boys singing to the choir? Remember Ciaphas? at the time of Christ? He too was a scolar and was well known for his knowledge of the Holy Writ. He didn't recognize Christ and he was given the bounty of meeting Him face to face. How about a little more unbiased seeking and a little less self indulgence? Brian Cté- Nashville, TN"
1,Poor Effort in Christian Critique,"The monograph is a true representation of a poorly researched effort into Christian critique, in this case of the Baha'i Faith. I found the work quite inadequate in its representation of an objective analysis of the Biblical analogies of the Bahai Faith. Not only was this an apologetic piece of polemic work, but the author's prejudices were so stunningly apparent, that it is truly hard to accept any of it as being objective. I found this typical of evangelical works wishing to shoot down beliefs other than their own negative classically conditioned sin diatribes. What a poor effort ! Tha author would have been better to investigate some Bahai works to gain personal first hand experience of this faith's teachings"
1,Christian writer on the attack,"This small book is a presentation of the Baha'i faith (or some aspects of it) from the viewpoint of an evangelical writer - one of those who fortifies his faith and thinks he shows his love for Jesus by attacking the beliefs of others. Eevn the attacks are unoriginal. There is nothing here that hasn't been written elsewhere. More to the point, there is nothing here that hasn't been refuted elsewhere."
1,Inaccurate Attack,"It is unfortunate that Beckwith, despite access to accurate information, nonetheless chose to attack the Baha'i Faith in this book using poor scholarship. It's not necessary to bend the truth to argue against the beliefs of a religion, and Beckwith would have more credibility if he had more fully researched his subject, and not relied on ill-informed sources."
1,A response to book,Francis Beckwith is a Christian writer who has taken uponhimself the task of discrediting the Baha'i Faith. Oneresponse by a Baha'i can be found at:http://www.bcca.org/~glittle/docs/paullamp.html
1,Embarrasingly limited perspective,"This book is a blatant attack on the Baha'i Faith by someone with an axe to grind. As mentioned by other reviewers, the booklet is an embarrasment to Christians.Perhaps the one use the booklet has is for training Baha'is on the kind of reaction they might get from more fanatical Christians. There are a number of websites that show evidence to dispute the author's claims. One was shown in a previous comment here."
1,This Viking ram is on a sinking ship,"I recieved my Viking C01064 256MB PC100 ram for my Compaq 18XL280 Laptop with anticipation of extra speed and performance. What a disappointment! After installing the ram, I found that the computer sat on the initial ""Compaq"" screen and wouldn't proceed any farther into the boot up process. Apparently the computer won't recognize the new ram. Switching back to my old 128MB ram worked so it appears the problem is with the new ram. This particular 256MB ram was the one that the ""Memory Finder"" said was compatible with my computer so I'm assuming it is correct. At this point, I'm going to get busy contacting Viking's 24/7 Technical Support line and see what happens but I'm not real happy about it...we'll see!"
4,Great for a Student,"Great camera, but so are all Nikon's I've used. The only problem was that I spilled developer on it and didn't know it in time to fix the camera. Oops. Luckily, it's not my only SLR."
2,Wow is this bad,I love how this book references its source material and then goes right against it. A truly bad read and I will never reread it.
4,They keep getting better!,"Waited anxiously for this one's release, being a GIANT Train fan. It definitely did not disappoint ... the second half is a bit laid back, especially after such rockers as ""All American Girl"", but the finish is strong enough to overcome it ... ""I'm About to Come Alive"" brings tears to my eyes every time. Pat Monahan is such a showman, it makes you feel like he'll break unless these lyrics come out. So impressed, but still ... a little more upbeat and this would be d-near impossible to beat."
2,A flat album,"First of I like Train alot, but I think this record is a little boring. The songs all sound the same. It seems like they just did ""Calling all Angels"" and the rest is filler. Train's first album is great and each song is different.It seems like they where like hey, ""Drops of Jupiter (2nd record) got us on the map, so let's make this album sound like that one."" I will admit there are a couple of good songs but I would just get the single if u haven't bought this disc yet. If you haven't gotten any Train disc yet I would def. get ther 1st disc"
4,Definitely a good listen.,"Starting out with the one two punch of ""Calling All Angels"" and ""All American Girl"" was interesting. I was waiting to see if the band could match the energy and sheer tuneful nature of these two cuts. I found myself impressed because the band maintains the quality throughout. I think the band was finding their footing after the uneven nature of DROPS OF JUPITER. There are a number of good cuts here from the edgy title cut to the plaintive ""Lincoln Avenue"" there is a maturity here and it is appreciated. I still think the lyrics are still a bit simplistic, there is no mystery everything is spelled out a bit too clearly, but this is definitely a good listen."
5,great album,"something tells me these guys are just getting warmed up. some great tracks include:Calling all angels: first single, not bad but it gets you into the albumWhen i Look to the Sky: 2nd single, my favorite song on the album. Will be a huge hit.All american girl: catchy as is my private nation.buy this, you wont regret it!! rock on \m/"
4,"Disappointed at first, but definately grows on you","I have been a HUGE fan of Train since 1997. I was disapointed at first with this CD. I gave it a few listens and I have grown to love it. No, it is not the Train that I first fell in love with, but don't dismiss it right away - the songs on this album (especially the 2nd half) grow on you.And if you love the old sound of Train, I recommend getting the CAA import from Australia. The B-sides on that CD should have been on MPN."
4,Their best so far...,"This effort reminds me of everything that I liked about their previous recordings without the stuff that I didn't. It's a very quick-moving, high-energy cd. Very enjoyable to listen to."
4,Taking this Train over and over,"You can't compare any of the Train CD's to one another because they all have different styles, but yet all are quality music. Calling All Angels, Get To Me, Counting Airplanes are the three best tracks. This is a fun CD that has some catchy lyrics that will stick in your head well after you turn the music off. That makes me know that the time I spent listening to the CD was well worth the time and will be for many years."
1,"One great song, followed by nothing but filler.","The first song on the SACD is ""Calling All Angels"" which is wonderful, and then it's downhill from there. If that isn't bad enough, the production is this incredible technique of ""in your face, all of the time""! The recording engineer must have been way too wired during mix-down. At times, almost unlistenable."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I bought this CD yesterday and was a bit disappointed. I've been a fan of Train before most people had ever heard Meet Virginia. The songs on the album just seem flat and are not very memorable. There is just no excitement on this album, unlike their live concerts. If you're a fan of Train, you'll still want to get this album - it's worth the money! Hopefully this album will grow on me."
3,Good Beginning ... unsatisfied hopes ....,"I absolutely fell in love with the song ""Calling All Angels"", as I think most people will. In tune with all the other artists clevely marketing their songs towards this unsure time of political and societal unrest throughout the world, this single gives a sense of hope to our bruised humanity.Unfortunately, the remainder of the CD quickly dissapoints. The music is predictable, and uninteresting and is peppered with lyrics that remind one more of Dr. Seuss and less like those of a talented rock group. In one word, the CD is boring."
5,I love all of their songs - The concert left me breathless,Pat is excellant - he gives so much to his band and they give so much in return - Train is a Super Group. They show so much respect to their (Fans) & share so much in their music. I have been a silent fan from the start. Being over 40 and a baby boomer you just have so much music you can relate to. After attending a Train concert I can say with out a doubt Train is my main group - My private nation is an outstanding release. All the songs are a favorite. I love them all and can relate to all the lyrics. I have seen bands come and go. Train has held a special part in my life. As I deal with an Illness that their is yet no cure for Its song #3 in my private nation that helps me through the toughest days. Not depressed just giving Train credit for being so wonderful and professional in song and spirit.
4,"Overproduced, but yet excellent.","I have to agree with the reviewer who felt it was overproduced. I felt that way also. But even with that being said, this is a great album to pick up. Train will be going up in the music world. I can see them being around for years to come, and it's nice to have begun a collection from the beginning. ""Calling All Angels"" has become a huge radio hit, and rightly so. Pick it up! I believe you'll be pleasantly suprised."
5,AWESOME!!,I LOVE TRAIN!!! ESPECIALLY CALLING ALL ANGELS/WHEN I LOOK TO THE SKY/AND MPN!!! AWESOME!!!
1,SO disappointed! What happened to my TRAIN?,"I saw what was happening with the 2nd cd (Drops)....and this one proves it. The first album was just amazing....one of the top 30 or so albums I own, that's saying a lot. But sure enough...corporate rock fingers gripped the band....gone are the great bluesy licks evident on cd#1, gone is the edgy rock that makes you want to step a little harder on the gas pedal.In are soaring vocals and sweeping synths that leave me cold. Train now sounds as over produced as Britney Spears.I wish the guys well, but I'm looking forward to the day their radio-friendly welcome will wear out (it will--sooner than expected). Maybe then the band will get signed to a smaller label and will start putting out music that rocks again -- when they wrote for themselves and not the bottom line."
2,no soul or substance,"...the songs aren't up to par and the fancy studio trickery makes it even worse...the band doesn't come through and it sounds like they fired the drummer for a beat machine. Only the vocals shine on this record which is nothing to brag about. If it wasn't for ""I'm About to Come Alive"" I would have traded My Private Nation cd for an american idol cd. I guess you guys didn't hear The Rising before you hired Brendan O'Brien."
2,"Ordinary, ordinary, ordinary...","I'm a bit disappointed with this latest recording by Train. The main things missing are: the use of string instruments we grew to love in ""Drops of Jupiter"", strong musical material and aggressive vocals by Pat Monahan. From the beginning to the end of the disc, it nearly sounds like one song. Now the ""one"" song you hear isn't bad, but it lacks excitement. There are, however, enough key changes and chord progressions to keep your interest...barely.Sad to say, this recording should have been called ""My Private B-sides Nation""."
2,HUGE Fan - But Not of This Album,"I've known and loved Train since long before they were known by most. I even sat and had wings and beer with the guys in a bar where only 50 or so people came to hear them, so I've been a pretty die-hard fan. So, I hate to say this, but I'm not a real fan of this album. Something is definitely missing! Perhaps its the absence of Rob Hotchkiss, but the album seems very bland and middle-of-the road to me. This album sounds less like a ""band"" and more of a Pat Monahan album with some occasional backup. As much as I love Train, I think this album is not very challenging musically and its a real disappointment to someone who has the first two albums as a regular ""staple"" in my CD player!Sorry, guys....its just not good enough!"
4,Better than most,"While not being too impressed with this cd initially, I continued to listen to it. After a few run-throughs, I realized that this is a great cd with several catchy songs. If you liked the last album from Train, you will not be disappointed with this one."
5,Perfect book for a newborn to age 2,"My son loved the baby songs videos which he started to ""watch"" from 4 months on. We would play a video and then put him to sleep in an effort to establish a bedtime ritual for his age. I am sure he did not watch the videos at the beginning; however, he certainly knew the songs and as his speech developed he was able to tell us which song was coming up next. Of course this repetition might drive you crazy as a parent. But babies love repetition. About every 6 months, we introduced him to another Baby Songs video. He loves them. The songs are sweet and the children sing along on many of the tunes. Babies of all ages, shapes and colors are represented. A truly professional movie. My son is almost 4 and has outgrown the baby songs videos, but every once in a while I remind him of the movie he loved as a baby and we both enjoy watching it. Highly, highly recommended!"
3,Try the others first.,Hap Palmer is very talented and has been writing kids songs at least since the mid-70's (my sister got one of his cassettes while in college getting a degree in elem. education). All 3 of my kids have loved his videos. But his best are Baby Songs (his first one) and More Baby Songs. This one is good but the others are better.
3,THE KIDS LOVE IT... BUT...,"I'M NOT SURE WHY, BUT THE KIDS LOVE THIS DVD! THERE ARE A FEW CATCHY TUNES THAT OUR SON LOVES TO SING AND DANCE TO. BUT AS SOME OF THE REVIEWERS HAVE STATED, I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE ""FINGER FOODS"" SONG... IT REALLY TEACHES SOME BAD DINNER TIME HABITS. I'M ALSO TROUBLED WITH THE SONG ABOUT GETTING DRESSED YOURSELF. THERE ARE SEVERAL CLIPS OF A YOUNG GIRL PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF HER CLOTHES. SHE MUST BE FOUR OR FIVE, WHICH IS A LITTLE TROUBLING... IT'S ONE THING TO SHOW A SMALL BABY IN THE TUB, BUT THAT VIDEO BORDERS ON CREEPY TO ME. ALL IN ALL A GOOD VIDEO, JUST KEEP THE REMOTE CLOSE TO SKIP THE PROBLEM SONGS."
2,FINE FOR THE MONEY,"Maybe my ear-holes are too small or something, but these headphones kept falling out and were uncomfortable when they were in. The sound was fine, nothing stellar, but I had no trouble hearing the music. On a good note, they are compact and great to carry in a purse or pocket. If you only have a couple of bucks to spare, and if your ears are big, than go ahead and buy them. Otherwise, shop around."
1,A complete waste of money,"I can't believe how [junky] these earbuds are. I debated between Koss and Sony, but Sony were twice as much. Unfortunately I bought them at a store where I could read the reviews. I'd return them but I bought them while on vacation. These things are totally [junk]. They're not shaped to fit the ears at all, and they fall out of mine within 30 seconds. They're totally unusable. My Sony's on the other hand (the cheapest, most basic) stay in even when I do sports. I learned my lesson trying to save a few bucks, and I'll never buy another Koss product again."
1,Pure Junk,"Just like everyone else, they did not fit well in my ears and continually fell out. Not only that, they do nothing to block out external noises. I'm looking again for something better, and will not be afraid to spend a little extra money."
1,These are REALLY bad earphones,I bought a pair of these and will never buy them again. The covers came off the earpieces and would NEVER GO BACK ON!!!! The sound quality was also very poor. Most of the time it seemed as if people around me could hear my music better than I could because the earpieces did not fit well into my ears. These are a complete waste of money!!
1,wrong product,I was sent the wrong book and it was a real hassle if I wanted to return it for a return. I will not order online again
4,Cute movie that my six-year-olds and I enjoyed!,"I didn't know if it would have English subtitles, but wanted it anyway. It does have English subtitles that you can turn on or leave off. I wouldn't suggest this as a film to teach about other cultures. Instead I like the film because there is a good lesson for children to understand that they, though small, have the power to help others, to change their community. It teaches them to question situations and find out why things are instead of automatically believing whatever the crowd says is true."
5,DVD purchase,I love Kirikou! It is great for all family members. There are so little childrens movies specifically depicted for African children and this is the best I've seen! Would recommend to all households wanting an animated cultural movie viewing experience.
3,"All right, but the original is better.","I love the animation, plot, and morals of this film, but I have to say the English dub was a bit disappointing after seeing it in French the first two times. It just wasn't as good to me."
4,Desent Movie,Kirikou like all African based cartoons often tells a story that has a social purpose. This point is that you can't judge a book by it's cover so with Kirikou
1,Customer Support?.........What's That?,"I have had my unit for 3 years and have had similar problems as noted on some of the other reviews, freezing, can't read data, etc......finally had enough, could not find a service center closer than 100 miles so I sent it to the company in Scottsdale AZ for repair.....they did not even open box and read my letter, just resent it to me unopened!!! What a bunch of Jerks! Maybe they will ""get it"" after I e-mail a photo to them of me smashing it up with a sledge hammer in my back yard!!"
2,GOVid4200 better,"To be honest, I haven't owned the 4000, but I do own the DVR4200 combo, and I think its quite nice (my rating is based on the 4000 versus the 4200). I haven't had the audio issues that others have brought up with the 4000, and I own a Dolby Digital receiver from forever and a day ago. The DVD player works fine, as a DVD, CD, and MP3 player. Haven't had any quams.Just thought that might help...I'd say don't bother with the 4000...waste of money."
1,DVR4000 - Not the most reliable DVD for the money,"I have owned my DVR4000 for about 8 months now. Over that time period, the DVD has continued to degrade. It began by not playing CDs after about a month. DVDs would then occasionally skip - a problem that became worse as time went on. Now, you can't get through a DVD without skipping/freezing numerous times.I am an electronic technician, so I opened it up to have a look. The DVD has only one laser. Most quality decks have two, one for CDs and one for DVDs. The main DVD control PCB runs excessively hot! That could explain the problem.I decided to call GoVideo/sonicBlue to see if I could get them to cover the problems under warranty. Parts are 1 year, labor is only 90 days. Funny thing, they have a separate 800 number for this model...sound like they have had a lot of problems?My advice - avoid the DVR4000. The DVR4500 or 4300 seem to be better models and are less expensive at current prices."
2,"Liked it at first, bought 2nd one...... now both are dead!","I am really disappointed in this product. As the title says, I bought one and loved it. Bought a second one for living room and was happy. After about 6 mos, (of course post warranty) mine started showing all DVDs very dark and then light. You couldn't watch a DVD. VCR worked ok. Then the second one started with the same problem. I was VERY upset about this and had no recourse. So I am writing this note hoping it will stop someone else from buying one and experiencing the same problems. As I said, at the get-go the unit was terrific. I expect a DVD to last longer than these did. They were both used by adults and probably used for a max of 2-3 DVDs a week.Did I replace mine? You bet. I bought a JVC and am happy with it. Just have to keep reading the manual to see how it all works.Skip Go Video..... save yourself a headache in the long run!"
3,"good, but what's with the hum?","we have plenty of VHS tapes for my kids, but really, DVDs are what to own nowadays, and this combo VCR/DVD made the most sense for the $ at the time. consumer reports liked it, friend had it, enough said. and it's a solid machine.but it's making this low freq hum that's driving me nutty. it's not loud enough to bother anyone in the room, nor does it seem like a mech prob, but it's loud enough that it's just weird. never had a DVD or a VCR make this noise before. ... could be. but that's why it's 3 stars, and not 4 or 5."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I had no complaints about this combo, until the DVD feature stopped working this past weekend. I only have it for 9 months, and now it no longer plays DVDs, doesn't matter what DVD I put inside, it does not recognize it. Since it's under the guarantee, I took it to have it serviced, but the guarantee only covers the parts, not the labor! Much to my surprise when I found out that the labor was going to cost me [money and I'll still have to look through my old receipts in order to get my guarantee for the parts, otherwise I'll have to give another[amount]for the part! Needless to say, I went out and bought myself a new DVD combo (from a different brand) because the money was just not worth it! Not even that, if it breaks again after 3 months, than I'll have no guarantee at all! Now I use this GoVideo combo as a VCR only... Use your money to buy a brand you can trust."
1,bootleg....vhs transfer,Don't waste your $$$$ on this.........A very interesting movie has been ruined via a transfer from a vhs tape......VERY POOR QUALITY........the packaging is scanned and on close inspection the discs have a laserprinted label with no indication as to copyright etc.........the images are out-of-focus having VERY low resolution. AND AT A VERY HIGH PRICE........Amazon shouldn't allow this to be offered for sale
5,Miami is NOT the REAL Florida!,Jeff Klinkenberg has been out in his car on the back roads and he's found the reason everyone moved to Florida in the first place. When my great aunt moved to North Miami in 1927 her house was on stilts (floods and alligators); now it is surrounded by 6 foot chainlink fence topped with barbed wire (urban animals!). Jeff talks to people who tell him the stories in between those extremes. Excellent read for anyone who wonders what was there besides the weather.
5,What a GREAT book for Floridians!,I think that I would read ANYTHING by Klinkenberg or Carl Hiaasen..........both are storytellers and fabulous for ANYONE who loves this wonderful state! This book in particular visits so many ecclectic Floridians and Klinkenberg is so gifted in sharing their lives and their fascinating contributions to Florida..........loved it and ordered 3 more for my friends!!
2,Just okay,I bought this book because my family lives near the beach. I thought our 17 mth son could relate to the theme. We were disappointed with this book: watercolors too light and hard to see and too few pages even for young child. The book did not keep son's interest and he loves to flip thru books and have you read to him. My recommendation: Find another book.
2,joshua By The Sea,"This is a beautiful story and stunning illustrations. Unfortunately, it is a rather small board book and somewhat awkward to read to a group of 20.However, it is on the book shelf for all to see by twos and threes!"
2,Could be better,"Is okay but it could be better, I'm tall so the steam comes out good but for example my wife is shorter than I am, and she has to keep her arm up in order for the steam to come out and you get tired pretty quick."
4,Pretty to look at,"The product is pretty to look at and has very nice space. The assemblage piece of it was a bit frustrating, pieces did not fit easily or snuggly at first. With a little push or pull it fell into place! Once together however, our new TV stand is a great product at a great price!!!"
4,Nice Stand,"Pretty nice little entertainment center. Don't exactly know what the previous customer was talking about...I'm not a female but i dont weight train either and this was an easy piece of furniture to put together. Nice maple finish and good functionality. Sorta small but it fits my needs. I wouldn't recommend if you want to put more than 3 boxes on the inside though; i.e. satellite, cable, dvd, video game system. Its a bit cramped for all of that, but again it does what its made to do well and thats all i expected of it. [...]"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! When one purchases a cheap piece of furniture, one should only expect a cheap piece of furniture. However, the one I received turned out to be defective, as it was missing the drilled holes in the bottom board necessary to assemble the piece. Defects happen, but with the a $50 stand and the associated shipping costs for such a product and the fact that it wasn't being sold directly by Amazon, the logic to support going through the hassle of returning the product simply wasn't there. Additionally, in part, I purchased this item because the reviews seemed okay. However, after having seen the product, had there been no issues with the one shipped to me, I can say that it is below par even for its price. Thus, $50+Shipping in the trash."
3,"Helpful, but I needed more ...","This book was good, but I do wish that the authors would go into more detail with regards to specific products and learning styles."
4,pretty good,"We homeschool and I tested each of my children and self for our learning styles. It was very helpful. My only complaint, my 6 year old had a hard time understanding some of the questions. Also, I definitely had to break it up over a whole week. I then did the preschool assessment for him (you answer the questions based on your observations, not by asking them questions) and that was even more helpful. The following chapters to explain each item were informative. They tended to be a bit overwhelming with the information. I was trying to read through it for 3 of my children at once and just struggled to retain. That's not a deal breaker for me though. I just need to come back to it when I have a bit more time to devote to each chapter and section. A good resource and I'm glad that I purchased it."
1,Terrible,This machine was purchased from seller supposing to be NEW! It was not New but was sold as NEW to me and it worked for one movie then died. This machine was remanufactured but sold as NEW. That should be illegal. MISREPRESENTATION!
3,Some good songs but not worth the price...,"I am new to Silverchair, I had heard of them but I'd never heard any of their songs before. Critics have called them a 'little nirvana', in some ways I can see this, but there are bands that try alot harder than this to copy nirvana's style. I wasn't that impressed with this album. Its not worth paying $21 (with shipping), that is just too much, even for a greatest hits album. Some of the tunes I enjoy increasingly like ""Emotion Sickness"", ""Freak"", and ""Blind"" <--- which was the song that made me buy this album. I was watching The Cable Guy one day and heard the song being played and I had to find out who it was by. I don't think that this band is amazing, but they don't suck. They have some talent at arranging good pop-rock songs. I might buy another one of their albums in the future, but for now this ""Best of"" c.d will have to grow on before that happens."
1,Don`t buy this!!!! The band disagreed with its release.,"It`s pathetic a band with 3 albums release a best of, don`t you think? I mean, think about it: The band has 3 albums, a total of 36 songs, plus about 10 bsides, and this best of has 22 songs!!! Even though I am a huge silverchair fan I will not buy it and I am totally against it, and I`d like to inform everyone that so is the band. They left Sony (they are now with eleven...), and then the company released it sort of as a revange, according to the band. Daniel Johns said they even thought about trying to make an anti-best of campaign, but they thought that would probably make people even more curious about it and it would end up divulging it even more, so they thought it was better to just leave it alone and just let people know they`re against it. He says that was just Sony trying to make money through them a last time, and, like I said before, it was also a revange, but he thinks it`s ridiculous."
3,wasnt rady,"Ok Silverchair was not ready to put out a greatest hits album after 3 albums.. I do Love Johns musik how ever disc 2 there was only maybe 2 songs i really enjoyed off the cd ""wasted/fix me"" and spawn..this cd is goood for new listeners to Silverchair...I respect Daniel, chris and Ben for what they have done at such an early age and have evolved over the 9 years.....from frogstomp to freakshow (Best album ever) to a mellower melody in Neon Ballroom...I think they could have waited to put out a hitz cd besides where is one of my favorite songs and by reading other reviews ""suicidal Dream"""
4,Greatest Hits?,"Well I'm really not sure why Silverchair has released a greatest hits album, especially considering that they have only 3 Albums. However, I am glad they did. Because I don't have any of their albums but I have always liked their hits. And I believe if you don't have any of their albums, this greatest hits album is a good way to get all of their good songs, plus some good b-sides with out buying any of their albums. I must say that their cover of Black Flag's ""Wasted/Fix Me"" is very good and so is their punk rock b-sides that they have done. I was also pleased to see that they put ""Untitled"" on this album. Which is the song that was on the Godzilla soundtrack.I wouldn't exactly call this album a greatest hits album because there are more re-mixes and rare b-sides on this album than there are hits. However, I do think that it is a good album and I highly recommend it to the people that like their music but don't own any of their albums."
4,Not their fault.,"While I agree this cd is good but lacking some great songs, all of you need to understand why. This album was rushed out to fullfill their album commitment for their label. They did not want to release a greatest hits album with only 3 full albums to their credit. I say we take it for what it is and get ready for the new Silverchair sound they will be bringing after Diorama, without a label holding them back and making their decisions for them. By the way, Isreal's Son is still their best song. And I agree with the guy that suggested the songs on a greatest hits album be chronological to show evolution, good call man."
3,GREAT COMPILATION FOR A GREAT BAND (3 STARS),"Silverchair has been one of the defining bands of my generation. I remember my friends and I being awe-struck that a pack of kids, no more than 15 years old, could write and produce a disc like they did in 1995 with ""Frogstomp."" And all the riveting guitar work of ""abuse me,"" the thumping bass line of ""Isreal's Son,"" and the band's first step in the limelight with ""Tomorrow"" are all on ""The Best of: Volume One.""Hopefully, the band is suggesting with the album's title it will be around for a long time to come. Long enough to produce a second (perhaps third) Greatest Hits disc. All the songs are great here. You get the highlights of the band's studio albums without having to switch discs around. Perfect, also for the Silverchair newcomer.I was thrilled when I heard about this album. Imagine getting an album with songs like ""Theme for 2000"" and ""Tomorrow"" on it. Thought I was in heaven.... Excited to see what this band will put out in the future."
4,"Silverchair, Greatest Hits Vol. 1","I wasn't a Silverchair fan until three years ago when I bought this cd. Forget what everyone else thinks, this cd kicks ass. Best tracks would include all songs from Frogstomp and Neon Ballroom. I would give this cd 5 stars but some of the punk songs at the end were stupid. I HATE PUNK ROCK!!"
2,Hardly worth it...,"If your thinking that maybe this is the best way to get introduced to Silverchair: YOUR CRAZY. 1.The only amazing cd this band put out was Frogstomp, meaning the only good songs one the record are those from Frogstomp. 2.With only 3 studio albums, isn't a Greatest Hits compilation kind of premature? 3. The only cd you need by Silverchair is Frogstomp. Freak Show was alright but after hearing Frogstomp you expected something much better than Freak Show. Finally Neon Ballroom... a prefect example of a band that has no idea whatsoever of what to write about. You think to yourself :""This can't be the band that blew me away with Frogstomp"". I believe that after the death of Grunge, Silverchair just didn't know what to do with themselves. The only reason I gave this cd 2 stars is because it contains some songs from Frogstomp. Forget about this one and buy Frogstomp."
4,"Pretty good. It was not Crusie's best, but I enjoyed it.","There were several funny lines. I wasn't as smitten with the characters as I usually am. Charlie tries various jobs and leaves them when he comes close to becoming a success. He doesn't want to be like his father. Allie is a great radio show producer and is great at making successes out of DJs. I didn't agree with some of her choices, for example: making a bet to avoid sex for one month and getting mad at Charlie for turning in a friend concerning drugs. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright. 1996. Genre: contemporary romance."
3,Some of my favorite people,"Some of my favorite characters were in this book, but I never did see where the whole thing with Charlie's brother was going."
4,A quick read,"I picked this up at the Library and what a find. This is a fun little (250 page) book about Charlie Tenniel who comes to a small town to solve a mystery undercover as a Radio DJ. Allie McGuffey is looking for a one-night stand and finds much more. I love Jennifer Cruisie book and will keep reading everything she rights. Take a chance on this book and also buy 'Welcome to Temptation,"" 'Faking it' and her newest 'Bet Me'."
3,I hate REPRINTS,"I agree with the previous reviewer - it makes me crazy to buy a book I think is new by a favorite author and find it is an old one. I don't mind so much that the publisher is reprinting these books; someone who is new to these authors (Nora Roberts is a good example) may want to buy older books. However I am REALLY disappointed in Amazon for not listing the old copyright date, with the new; as it is listed in the book. I almost got stuck with this book. I hope Amazon reads these reviews and changes how they list reprints. Thank you to the reviewer who saved me from paying for a book I had already read - a long time ago. As a note, I've noticed that Nora Roberts has started putting an emblem on her books that are REALLY new (NR). Also, please don't misinterprete this as a bad review for Jennifer Crusie. I LOVE her books, all of them. So if you haven't read this one, go ahead it is pretty good. My favorites are Welcome to Temptation and Bet Me."
3,okay,"After reading Welcome to Temptation, I was a huge Jennifer Crusie fan. I gobbled up everything that she had written earlier - Crazy For You and Tell Me Lies were fabulous! So, my expectations were high when I read Charlie All Night. I was disappointed. The writing is solid and the romance is good, but overall it doesn't have that Crusie sparkle that I've come to expect."
4,Charlie All Night,"Allie has been demoted at the radio station where she works as a producer and was dumped by her boyfriend. She plans to use the fill-in DJ, Charlie, to make her comeback, and turn him into a household name. If she can use him to make her ex-boyfriend jealous, well that's just a bonus. Charlie, however, has no intentions of becoming famous, but he is willing to be Allie's rebound guy. When their one-night-stand becomes a four week gig, neither Charlie nor Allie are sure how they feel about him leaving to go back home.This is a quick, fun, and entertaining read. The interactions between characters are funny and the dialog is witty. There's even a little mystery, as Charlie tries to find out what's behind a threatening letter that was sent to the station owner. Not a deep, thought provoking book, but if you're looking for a light romance I'd recommend this."
4,"Good, fast read!!!!","Charlie All Night was a good book about a woman named Allie who works at a radio station and falls for a man named Charlie, who is a DJ in disguise. I need not say more, as all of these books end the same."
2,More like Susan all night...,"I am one of those people who can't sleep on a plane no matter what. How sad for me that I'm on so many red-eye flights! Of course, I'm not really all that coherent either, so I can't bring along anything too challenging to read. On a recent flight, I packed Jennifer Crusie's Charlie All Night. It sounded perfect!The novel itself is a light romantic comedy about a DJ on the late-night shift and his female producer. There are all sorts of subplots, but I can't muster the enthusiasm to write a synopsis. I've enjoyed Crusie's work in the past, but this particular story started out dumb, moved on to contrived, and traveled downhill from there. The plot got more and more silly--not funny, silly--and the behavior of the characters was simply unbelievable. Oh, I finished the book, but not even the ending was all that satisfying. As you can see, I was pretty ""meh"" about the whole experience. Unhappy skies for me!"
3,Not sure how I feel about this book,I couldn't tell where the story was going for a while. I know there was a mystery to be solved but of course that's secondary to the romance between the two main characters. I liked how they first met at a bar and how she picked him up. I like the romance but the story itself is so-so.
1,IT SLIPS,"IT MY FAVORITE BOOK BUT IT SLIP SOME PART, I MAKES ME UPSET, BUT THAT IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABT IT, SO I TRY TO FIX IT MYSELF"
3,Sweet but predictable,"I enjoyed the character development, but thought the story was a little too predictable. A decent, quick read, but it wasn't a page-turner."
3,Not so happy with this product,"I made the mistake of buying a pen I'd never held. The rubber grip slides up and down, not much, but just enough to make it uncomfortable. I'm sure it wouldn't bother most folks. It writes well. I was looking for a good price, you get what you pay for. I gave it 3 stars entirely for the grip, or lack thereof."
