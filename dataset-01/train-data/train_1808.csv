1,Don't buy from Marco.,"They don't offer any refunds only exchanges. You can only find this out when it is too late since its' not stated anywhere.My advice is ""buyer beware"" and then don't buy."
5,Remarkable book,"""For all the sometimes rowdy comedy attending Amis's depictions of meanness, his understanding of its psychology is complicated and serious. It is, if funny, also immoral, so little and minimal, practiced by wee men only. And it betrays neurosis, implying constant ""paranoid"" watchfulness lest one be had. It keeps one on a constant stretch of attentive calculation, and this finally becomes a substitute for thought, as well as replacing an objective interest in things outside oneself.""""I feel STRETCHED"", Bilbo Baggins after having the One Ring for a while."
1,Pedro's Review,"I was forced to read this book for my 20th century history class and there is not a moment that I do not regret it. Although there may be some historical value in Tang's take on the Vietnam war, it made for a boring and tedious read. The flow of the book was choppy and difficult to read. I would not recommend this book to anyone beside serious historians, because no one else could find this book enjoyable."
2,Confusing!,"This may have been one of the worst books i have ever read. It was very rambling, with little substance of the war and mostly discusses personal relations. The characters are very hard to follow, first of all. Perhaps if I had been a witness to the war (as i was not), i may have been able to follow the characters. Otherwise, however, I wish you good luck finding out who they are, because you are not told in the book. Even major players in the story are just brought in, as if you are expected to know who they are. In addition, the book contains little opposing opinions to its standpoint on the war. To tell you the truth, after reading the book, I am glad that this guy lost the war."
3,Seems like a cool compilation....but...,"The record company who put dis out didn't bother to use a picture of the 'Sonny Boy' who actually recorded these cuts, John Lee Williamson (pictured on the cover is Aleck Rice Miller, who also used the name Sonny Boy Williamson. He did not start recording till da fifties though.)What I find a wee bit creepy is that look in Rice Miller's eyes, like if he's laughing at John Lee, sayin ""Who's da real Sonny Boy now b-i-e-t-c-h!"
2,Mediocre Public Domain Collection,"As might be assumed from the price for the 60 movies included (actually 62 movies on ten discs in the product I received) they are from public domain sources of not very good quality. By way of comparison, the older films are poorer quality than their Alpha Video counterparts, which are themselves only average. The older ones are packed up to eight movies per side, shortened in length and apparently digitally compressed to fit, even using dual-layer recording. Better viewing of these movies is available on any of the TV movie channels. Even the newer ones from the 70's and 80's are not good quality. I would only buy this pack to obtain the rarer titles included (few of them are critically rated better than two stars, however). Particularly disappointing are the very old ones (Vanity Fair with Myrna Loy, etc.), which are barely watchable."
1,don't buy from Brands on Sale,"The item shipped, a $50 Alice costume, is a different size than what I saw online. Also, it is a 'youth' size, not 'adult' as the website said, and made in China (we all know items from China are extra small). In short, -it doesn't fit. So I tried calling the merchant BRANDS ON SALE on two different occasions and was on hold for an hour each time before I gave up. On their webpage I saw that they do a lot of Halloween sales, so I figured I'd call back once Halloween is over.After a long hold -again- they finally told me that now it is too late to return the item. I told them that I was unable to reach them, -they answered 'can't be, we got lots of phone calls during that time period'.Is it reasonable to hold for over an hour? ..esp. when you know the rush will be over in a couple of weeks?My advice is STAY CLEAR OF DEALING WITH BRANDS ON SALE."
5,Hilarious with the real feel,Super funny and focused on the everyday guy and our childhood of the past. Didn't stop laughing for the entire hour.
5,Funny Man,"If you've seen him on ""Mike and Molly"" you know what perfect comedic timing Billy Gardell has! His story about the dog protecting the little boy made me laugh so hard I cried! This DVD finds Billy in front of his hometown crowd! Very funny addition to your DVD collection and makes an awesome gift!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"This was another wonderful CD of Blind Boys. The songs are more traditional and have a more traditional gospel sound, but I doesn't sound 'old'. The guest musicians do a great job. The guitar on this CD sounds spectacular. This is nothing like Spirit of the Century, but it is just as good. If you like and follow the music of the Blind Boys, this will not dissapoint you!"
3,"A Bit Disappointing After ""Spirit of the Century""","This album was a bit disappointing after ""Spirit of the Century"". It has some good, soulful numbers, and those are great. But the producer often chose to emphasize electric instruments over the Blind Boys' vocal harmony, which is a shame. The choice of numbers is weak, too, emphasizing ""hit tunes"" rather than the Blind Boys' gospel roots. I do listen to this album, hitting the ""Next Track"" button to skip over the fluff."
1,Kilpatrick needs an editor,"If an editor took out all the repetitious, irrelevant waste from this book, it would only be 200 pages. There are much better books about Buffett and BRK, and the annual reports are fabulous, but this book is a waste of time. It is poorly written and badly organized. It is as if he had written 100 short newspaper articles, and strung them together into a book about himself and his own relationship with BRK. He is obviously a nice man, and I am sorry he has not written a better book."
5,HIghly Recommended!,"Andrew Kilpatrick has written a most unusual biography of one of the world's richest men, investor Warren Buffett. Instead of the dry chronology presented in most biographies, Kilpatrick has stuffed his 890 pages with 157 immensely readable, personal and professional vignettes. They are arranged in no particular order, yet they add up to a detailed and satisfying journey. Filled with plenty of inside detail from numerous original and published sources, the book lets you pull up a comfy chair inside Warren Buffett's brain. We [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in investing and general business, and to curious readers of all persuasions."
1,Rather disappointed,"A lot of info about Buffett & his investment history, but most of them is useless. I see rubbish rather than helpful info in this book."
3,Ballooning volume size with shrinking contents,"Kind of dissapointed after flipping through the two huge volumes. Nice pictures (but many of them not that clear)through out the book, and seemed to keep up to day with most of the recent events related to Warren Buffett. But the events has not much to read about. For example, about Buffett's purchase of USG stocks lately, only simply mentioned the fact without any background or related story (but the table of contents sure seemed to suggest otherwise). The older one-volume version of the book seemed to have more stuff to read then the new two-volume version, even the older text-only cover seemed to be nicer than the colorful picture-jammed new cover. The new 2 volume version seems to be a chronicle album rather than a historical book. Usually less really means more. Ballooning a book's size with air would only send the disappointed readers away."
2,"Badly written, badly edited, superficial and chatty","The best thing it has going for it are the photos, and the anecdotes (many from investors). Enjoyed the annual meeting part.But the book is badly written, and badly in need of an editor. Looks home published.As a biography, Lowenstein is clearly superior. For analysis of investing history and method, go with Buffettology or Hagstrom."
3,Cherry Coke,"This book is an unadulterated ""fan guide"" on Buffet.The book is too long, and needs a forceful edit.A minor gripe is that at least once in every chapter, the reader is constantly reminded that Buffet really, really, really likes cherry coke!!There are a couple of really interesting, and useful chapters outlining Buffet's investment style. These chapters alone make the book a worthwhile buy.Just use the contents page ruthlessly."
2,I wouldn't buy this,"Although I believe that Warren Buffett is the most interesting investor of our time, those seeking insight into his methods or are well advised to look elsewhere. This book is nothing more than a collection of short anecdotes about specific times in Mr. Buffett's life; the possible implication is that by understanding these stories, you'll understand the man, and perhaps be able to invest like him. If that is what you want, start with The Intelligent Investor, or, if more enterprising, Security Analysis. If you want to understand the man, this may be a good place to start, but I find the author's style made me feel like I was reading newspaper articles, rather than a more fluid prose. I'd be happy to sell you mine if you want it."
4,Berkshire Hathaway a company with perpetual growth model,Mathematically nothing can grow forever but Berkshire at least seems that way. And that is exactly what the Oracle of Omaha has created. A business model that few understand. It took me several years to understand this empire moulded and nurtured by few honest men with Warren Buffett at the helm. This book is part of my library because it gives all the details one would like to know about the company and the man who runs it. The Oracle is as honest as history of business has ever known.This book is a gem and must be in every library of every business school on this planet and everyone who wants to know about Berkshire and Warren Buffett.
1,Searching for TRUTH?,"""THEY CAME TO EARTH MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO TO SPREAD THE POISON OF HATRED, WAR AND CATASTOPHE...Do you REALLY want to know who ""they"" are?May I recommend:(...)"
3,Is this book a Scientology front?,"I read this book with great interest over two years ago, but only recently have begun to understand the gnostic references which Bramley mentions. This text sounds suspiciously based on Scientologist belief systems. Given the paranoia and secrecy surrounding the more exotic of the Scientology cults, I would be willing to wager that much of the information found within is the result of indoctrination into this subculture. However, I gave it three stars because, even with these underpinnings, the book still undertakes an intelligent discussion into conspiracy issues, which is hard to come by in a world of spooks and skeptics."
5,The Gods of Eden,"If you have never had a history lession and know nothing about how ""Behind the Scene"" players control goverments and institutions then start your journey of knowledge and read ""The Gods of Eden""."
1,More Tired Alien Stuff,"You know this book had some potential in the first half, but the last half of the book was a total let down. I figured the alien stuff would creep out but I didn't figured the taps would be on full blast. Gimme a break. Everytime someone gets a bee in their bonnet to explain some myterious happening - we get another mystery. Explaining one mystery with another mystery is better left to the Eric Von Danikens or Zech Sitchins. Tear this book in half and throw the last half in the trash."
1,This is horrendous,"This book is horrible. I did not find one kernal of solid evidence or anything even remotely speculative. He mostly steals from Zecharia Sitchin's hard work and research and comes off more pathetic than even Erik von Daniken. I love this TYPE of reading, but this is a horrible speciemen. The only thing even remotely interesting was his story about the Count of Saint Germain. I strongly advise anyone who is thinking about this purchase, to pick up Sitchin instead. Or even take your self out of the new age section and grab Graham Hancock. This is just silly."
1,Off the Wall,Too much conspiracy and enough historical analysis. I don't see how this author can produce a monograph on this subject based entirely on conspiracy theories and secret societies and market it as a historical book. Don't waste your time on this
4,The Gods Of Eden,"Very good! The book solves the question about different tribes (Hebrews, Sunnis, etc) and civilizations (Meso-American,Asian, etc). claiming the gods or God as the ""one and only"". More importantly the book clearly points out what all Buddhas, sages, and worthies have repeatedly stated: ""Enlightenment comes from within, not outside yourself."""
3,"Is the ""So called Devil"" really a bad guy?","I do not agree with 100% of this book. Many issues are not supported by enough evidence to allow Brawley to make certain statements. I still gave the book 3 stars because Brawley did present some entirely new information. His reference to the serpent of the ""Garden of Eden"" (Taken from the bible) as being symbolic of a being (Enki) who was trying to spiritually free the Adamites was profound. This thesis, if true could render Christianity useless!"
3,"He almost got it, but....","The truth is we are simply a very large videogame to the people of other worlds. Wars are created to play a game--with humans as the game pieces. You are being manipulated to entertain creatures from other worlds that are far superior to you. To them, it's like a kid playing with an insect."
5,The Gods of Eden,This is a book to open your mind to all the possibilities of human history and really of the universe. I am still ponderingmy own beliefs and I think his views have great validity.
5,There is Much to Fear!! Consider Reading this Book Carefully,"Notice the reviews on this book. There are very few in the middle. Those who praise the book have read it. That is obvious from the knowledgeable approach they have taken to their review. They have read the book.The detractors obviously have not. This is evident from comments which the paranoid skeptics make. They attribute the book with motives and text that aren't present in any shape or matter.However, if you do read the book, and you reading without bias, it may shake you. There is Much to Fear!! Consider Reading this Book Carefully,"
5,Highly recommended,"Christians will always give this a bad review because they only want to hear what they want to hear. They are narrow minded individuals and will never accept anything with an open mind. They will always be a slave to social consciousness. I would recommend this book to fans of Zecharia Sitchin, Eric Von Daniken etc...who wants to explore the real truth about the past."
2,Food for Consipracy Theorists,"I read this book about seven years ago when I had voracious appetite for the works of Joseph Campbell and Carl Sagan. I thought this book would help me understand some of the dragons of eden and the history mythology. It did neither. In fact the book is nothing more than a large canvas on which conspiracy theorists can spread their full course picnic. Bramley certianly writes well and paints and interesting picture of a ""brotherhood"". But his is nothing more than rehashed, old and tired conspiracy stuff that quite frankly is boring and stiff in its theme. I think Karl Marx and the class struggles of the 19th century are more accurate decriptions of alien races and subjugated classes, but nothing more than the emperors new clothes dressed up in alien abductions, crop circles and ancient brotherhoods from another world - silly!. There's more to learn and write about then this junk. Sorry"
1,Pure Speculation,"Of course none of this stuff is supported by any evidence or ""facts"". This material is nothing more than speculation, innuendo and rumour. Secrets societies exist - no question there. But to say they're controlling virtually everything, including plaques and wars is nonsense and goofey in my mind. And to say alien beings from other worlds are involved - whew...Where is the evidence Mr Bramely?"
1,Fractured History,"I'm half way through the book but don't know that I'll ever finish it. The author's premise is that religion and secret societies were created by aliens (referred to as Custodians) to control and manipulate the human population that they had created. He fails to show exactly what all this manipulation gets for the E.T.s. Because of the poor scholarship regarding Christianity in particular, I am uneasy about what he has to say on everything else, including the UFO sightings. And finding the UFO sightings is like finding needles in a haystack - too few and far between. An abridged version with less historical commentary would have been better."
1,The Gods Of Eden,"The subject matter of the book is interesting, but I find the author rambling on and on about every topic under the sun. Most of what the author dwells uppon has little or nothing to do with extraterrestials. For example, in one chapter he re-hashes the European campaign of World War II and in another he rambles on about modern capitalism. After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a book along the lines of ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" or Erich Von Dannikan's ""Chariots of the Gods"" (no plug intended). I know these are classics but they are so because, I believe, they both stick to the subject matter from cover to cover and they both make a compelling point."
4,Good overview of competitive mathematics (and mathematics in general),"""Count Down"" is a well-written and concise profile of the International Mathematical Olympiad and, more broadly, the field of mathematics. While the book offers an engaging overview of the Olympiad, its real strength is in its coverage of the individuals underlying the contest.Steve Olson provides readers with an insightful and unique perspective on what type of person and abilities it takes to become a part of a Mathematical Olympiad team. Moreover, the book challenges the reader with facts and anecdotes related to the roles ""nature"" and ""nurture"" play in the evolution of traits such as creativity."
3,Too much filler,"CD is two books in one, one interesting, the other pedestrian. The interesting book includes: profiles of participants in the 2001 IMO + some description of the IMO itself + partial solutions of the IMO problems. The pedestrian book includes: lengthy digressions on the topic of genius/talent. CD weaves back and forth between both books. The result: a greatly short-changed book one. Profiles could have been much longer/deeper; the event could have been described in greater and more interesting detail; solutions (relegated to Appendices) could have been complete. The contents of book two read like an extended (fragmentary) book report. The topic of genius/talent has been ably treated elsewhere in the literature. All of book two, considerably compressed, would far better have served to introduce a much expanded book one.CD reads well enough; it does provide a couple hours' entertainment. It could have been so much more."
4,A Fun Book To Read......,"Mrs. Billups reminds me of my husbands Grandmother. She was always superstitious about pins and carrying a shovel in the house or some such thing. When we read this book, my daughter and I, I could not help but to think of her.Mrs. Billups is an elderly lady who is very superstitious. She picks up every penny and pin she sees and will not kill a spider because they are lucky. You will enjoy all the scrapes she gets into while trying to keep Smokie a black cat and her black kittens from getting in her path. Does Mrs. Billups remind you of anyone you know?Once again Mrs. Carrolls illustrations are wonderful. You may have to borrow this from your local library as it is no longer in print. If you find it I am sure you will enjoy it."
1,"It's all art, no mining history here--none, nada, nothing!","As a member of the Board of Directors of the Mining History Association, I purchased this video to learn a little more about mining in ancient Greece. The video does mention that there were mines at Laurium. It says NOTHING else about mining--not how, when, or where (besides in Laurium). The discussion of Greek art was not the best that I have encountered, but I would still give it 3 or 4 stars. So, assuming that the scholar(s) who put this video together were competent, I going to further assume that they needed a title for this episode and made a very poor choice. I repeat, the video has no mining history--none, nada, nothing!"
1,Re-recordings! Beware!,"I thought we were finally getting a comprehensive greatest hits album from Brook Benton, but what SHOULD have been his original Mercury recordings are lame remakes. Instead of becoming a part of my music collection, this CD will go in our next garage sale. It is a rip-off!"
2,disappointing,"Having read and enjoyed the Munch Mancini series, I was disappointed by the weakness of this book. I agree with other reviewers that the premise of a PR person with OCD has great possibilities. Surprisingly, though, the writing was in many ways like that of a new author - many awkward bits, where, as a reader, I wanted to edit/rewrite. I'm not sure why this happened with an experienced author unless, maybe, she was ill and wanted to finish quickly. In any event, it is sad to know that she will not be able to continue this series."
2,CHECK SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS!,"I just purchased this package. I have been extremely happy with the Brittanica products in the past. HOWEVER, this particular package has the rather unusual requirement that it will run ONLY on G5 and dual core processors! In other words, this will not run on ANY of the majority of Macs currently in use, particularly in educational settings (where the machines tend to be not cutting edge), and won't run on any Mac laptops except the new Mac Books."
4,not too bad,"beside the radio signal, it works well. the money is worth it. I used it as a back up alarm, because it much louder then my phone alarm. The radio stations are limited, the quality of musics isn't as great."
3,The Best of Thomson's Potboilers,"The best of Jim Thomson's paperback originals--the prose is clean, almost elegant (Thomson's attempts at literary experimentation are clumsy and pretentious, and his attempt at psychopathic cornball first-person are strained and affected--the first half of John Fowles' THE COLLECTOR is a million miles ahead of Thomson in this sort of thing). And the plot, about a cold-blooded bank robber and his wife scheming and counter-scheming with the accomplices in a messy bank robbery is lively and clever except for the last chapter, which reaches for the outrageous and only achieves the dubious (the ending devised for the film version is much better).In short, a good crime novel--nothing more, nothing less. Thomson had some skill as a writer, but not as much as some would have you believe, and such talent as he possessed was never really stretched in a serious fashion. Ruth Rendell is a serious novelist disguised as a crime writer. Jim Thomson was not."
4,The Quilters Daughter,"I found this book an interesting read. It is very imformative about the Amish people, occasionaly using some of their Pennslyvania-Dutch dialect in the text.It is the story of a young Amish women that has to decide between going to help her pregnant 47 year old mother in Pennslyvania or staying in Ohio with her soon to be husband. Then, a double tragedy stikes and leaves Abby in ruins. It tells about how she copes with these events and about how she recovers.For people who want an uplifting read full of action, I would not recommend this book. It has a lot of depressing moments, but that makes it a lot more real than having Abby's life go on with no troubles at all. The ending leaves you hanging a little bit, but it's a good book over all."
5,Loved It,"If you haven't read this book, then you are truly missing out on a wonderful book. This is a series, and I am currently reading The Bishop's Daughter. Often times, series are rather boring, but that is definitely not the case with this series. I'd say this series is one of my favorite top 5 reads of all times."
1,"Lousy,",the abrupt and overly contrived happy ending left much to be desired...but then so did the entire book....too much dull dialogue....the only interesting part of the story was just left dangling...Linda and Jim and little Jimmy were totally not addressed at the end of the book....
4,"Overall, very listenable late 60's folk pop......","An obscure late 60's release from UK Pye records, ""The Lady Came From Baltimore"" contains (of course) a version of the Tim Hardin song of the same name, and other orchestrated folk/pop. This is one killer version of ""The Lady Came..."" holding its own quite well among the crowd of covers. And that's saying something, since Bobby Darin and many others have acquitted the tune in splendid fashion. Despite an occasional weaker effort here and there, most of the songs are pretty fresh and listenable."
4,More Than a Period Piece,"Cliff Aungier's style on this 1969 album lies somewhere between the etherealness typical of British folk and the more earthy flavor common to American folk, sort of a blend of Phil Ochs and Donovan. The original songwriting isn't especially memorable, but the beautiful cover of Tim Hardin's ""The Lady from Baltimore"" and a spirited version of Dylan's ""Down Along the Cove"" help lift this recording from three stars to four."
5,Great product for a great price!,"These speakers are super I accidentally put a hole in one of them and it still performs highly. They sound perfect and since they're 3-way they handle every type of sound great, the sound is clear and best for every music type!"
2,Plays sound jusy not top of the line.,"These speakers work just fine for day to day use, if you were going to play loud music often or with alot of base then forget it they sound like crap when you turn it up loud and hit like garbage"
3,Good buy for the price!,"Bought these speakers to put in my 2000 Xterra. They are pretty good quality and do what they are supposed to do. If you like to listen to music really loud, than this is not what you want. Over all these are good speakers for the price."
4,power acoustik 6-1/2 speakers,A good buy for the price.The speakers sound great.I am very pleased with the product.
4,nice for ladies,this iteam is good for ladies we don't need all the noise these speakers is just enough for us.
5,A great handheld read!,"This is a great little book, full of hints and tips on how to manage your handheld. Written with hospitals and doctors in mind, there is still a wealth of information for those who just want to get to know their handheld better. It covers both Palm and Windows operating systems. Mo Ubaydli is a handheld guru and his enthusiasm for these wonderful machines shines through. Even better is that it is also a very easy book to read. Thoroughly recommended and a great resource, well written with several examples of how to make the most of these little marvels!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Well of course the old saying holds true, quality comes with a price and this isn't it. This "" Made in china"" phone is very poorly put together and smells like new tires. It does work but the sound quality and clarity are poor. If you just want a cheap phone for the kids room or something then it is fine."
4,Casio Keyboard,"This is for my son, a budding musician. He loved the keyboard and it is his latest favorite instrument with which he spends most of his weekends."
1,"Sounds, Volume Settings and Power Supply","Very dissapointed with my purchase.1. Even if you turn the volume to its lowest setting the keyboard sound is too loud. Worse, its default setting is 5 (scale from 1 to 10) which is way too loud. Each time your child turns the unit on and starts playing without thinking to turn down the volume first you have to hold your ears. Especially if you smaller children you know they are not going to turn down the volume by themselves.2. The various sounds are quite dissapointing. Of the 100 or so sounds I can only stand the piano sound which sounds ok - not great.3. The unit comes without a power supply so you better buy lots of batteries.I didn't expect much when I bought the unit. It was to be a simple toy for my 2 year old daughter. We will have to throw it out, primarily because of the volume issue."
3,power problems,"I bought this keyboard and returned it rght away when the sound fritzed out after a day. I got the new one (great customer service from Amazon), put in new batteries and was thrilled, it's just right for a beginner. But after less than 24 hours the batteries are, I guess, used up? The ragged electronic sound is back now on the second keyboard. How can that be? It should come with an adaptor and/or make clear that this is really necessary if it goes through batteries this fast. I'd rather have an adaptor than the cheap microphone headset. It was only turned on while I used it, for no more than 6-8 hours total."
3,music maker,I got this so I could practice my vocal music at home. It was very frustrating to open the box and realize that there is no power supply included in the package and that I have to order that separately!
5,Great for starters and kids,"I think this is perfect for kids starting off. My kids love all the funky sounds and the beats.If purchasing with the stand, the stand is adjustable, and works for standing position, not sitting, it is too high."
2,"Not bad, but not good either","I bought this keyboard to practice in my van during lunch. I figured that the other reviewers deemed this a pretty decent machine, so I bought it. I find it to be somewhat cheap. The keys are thin, and somewhat fragile. The volume goes right to full when you turn it on. The keys are small, but it is very portable. The ""voices"" are ok. The piano at lower octaves sounds overly synthetic. There is no variance on how you strike the key, you touch it and thats it, you get the full hit of the key.For the money it is ok, it's cheap enough...There is a real market for something portable, small, and built well.All the other smaller keyboards that I have seen are USB keyboards for your computer, and not for my van."
4,Grandchild loved it!,"I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday. She really enjoyed playing it. As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day. It is the perfect size for a small child. She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms. The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it."
3,Pretty Good.. Worth the price,"I bought this recently. I had played in a Casio LK200 keyboard. Though there is a little difference in the sounds, but if I compare the price, this is worth it. There is a small feeble noise coming from the speaker if I press one of the first 3 keys. It is pretty ignorable and overview I should say, I like this."
1,Keyboard,I would have like to have known how cheap this was made.It is good for the kids to play with but had I realizedit was chinzy I probably would have saved my money.
3,Cute little keyboard,"We bought this for my 10 yr old son for Christmas who has been asking for a keyboard with lots of buttons on it. He was very very happy and it does have a lot of buttons... Including one that makes a laser sound so you can imagine how happy we are that it also has a volumn button. :) Two cons, though: 1. It feels cheap when you pick it up. 2. It takes 5 AA batteries and the plug is sold seperate. I would have rather had the plug than the microphone thing.Overall I think it's a nice little beginner keyboard. Although you may not want to buy it for someone whose too young to take proper care of it."
4,A Little Too Small,"I gave this item 4 stars because it lived up to what I ordered it for. The sound is good and it has numerous playing options. However, once I started playing with it, I realized that it was too small for my needs. There are not enough keys, and the keys are very small. I decided I wanted to get into really playing, rather than just playing around, so I borrowed a large keyboard and have been learning on that.While this keyboard would be great for a child to begin learning on, it's not for anyone who wants to seriously learn to play.I do like the fact that it's portable, and I can take it with me if I go out of town to keep in practice, or even if I want to move to another room, but next time I will get a full-size keyboard.I really feel that the keyboard quality is excellent for a small keyboard, it just didn't meet my needs."
3,Not bad for the price. . .,"This keyboard is just a decent noise-maker for kids. I bought it so I would have a portable musical reference for a college music theory course.Two complaints, one small, one huge:No big deal, but the ""tones"" you can select from sound pretty weak, although there are a bunch to choose from so it's not hard to find something that sounds okay.But it really irks me that you can't play more than four keys at the same time! If you have any experience with the piano you're going to find this shortcoming completely unacceptable.Two bits of praise:There is a digital display showing both the treble and bass clef staves. When you hit a key the display shows you where the pitch falls on the staves. Ingenious! Perfect for beginners just learning.Very lightweight and portable.Conclusion: Great for kids, but don't even think about it if you have been playing for any amount of time."
4,Casio SA75 Keyboard,We bought this item for our 7 year old grand daughter and she loves it. The headset microphone is a big hit withe her and her 9 year old sister. Christmas afternoon we could hear the playing and singing in their room.
1,Lets not buy this.,"Cmon people,are you really going to spend [so much] for just 3 songs.The logic that im using should be enough to convince you to not buy this slbum.Ofcourse all the songs are remixes since this guy cant produce any new or original music of his own.Please dont buy this [item] and dont say I didnt warn you."
2,Cute shoes but not comfortable,"I love the way these shoes look, but they are not very comfortable. I wore them for a wedding this past weekend, and had to take my shoes off when the dancing started because the toe strap had cut my toe open."
5,Fascinating Look at a Vanishing Culture,"Because I'm interested in the history of the nomadic Turks of Central Asia, Mongolia, and eastern Russia, I had hoped for more on nomadic life and especially the author's experience of Kazakh culture. Instead, she focuses primarily on modern Mongolia, as experienced during her year in Mongolia's westernmost village. Even so, the writing is beautiful, the observations gritty and unique, and the author's outlook wonderfully balanced (few stereotypes here). A book well worth reading!"
5,"All the ups and downs of a rugged, isolated lifestyle","Author Louisa Waugh moved to a remote village in Mongolia after two years working in the country's capitol: HEARING BIRDS FLY is the first-person account of the year she spent living with the villagers. From the hardships of a dark Mongolian winter into a lush summer and nomadic existence, Waugh's story captures all the ups and downs of a rugged, isolated lifestyle."
4,HUH? MOUTH WITH TEETH AT THE END OF IT?!?,"I really did not know what to expect when I bought this book. It was recommended to me by a friend. Laymon's style of writing is very good and it holds your attention. I found the story to be unique but very odd. Hence the title to this review. I can't really imagine any woman enjoying THAT! The ones who mate with them can never go back to human men. ODD! I visualize what I read, so I was most definitely squeezing my butt cheeks together as I read those explicit parts. I am giving it the four star rating because it was a good book and I plan on reading the rest of the series."
1,Stick with The Beast House,This was pretty much a dumb idea. I kept hoping that it would get better.. but it never did.. It pains me to waste money on junk.. and that's what I did.. threw my money away.. Thanks alot Laymon..
4,"A Good, Long Read","One of the best aspects of The Midnight Hour is that it gets more interesting the farther into it you get.While some horror novels start strong and then quickly become devoid of interesting story, The Midnight Tour does the opposite.The first act is by far the weakest and, despite the fact that the ending unravels a little bit - I won't reveal anything - The Midnight Hour is a surprisingly good read.The one thing that Laymon does with his characters that is annoying is that he over-characterizes them, leaving little to the imagination. While subtlety is not rampant in pop horror, this novel would have benefited from more mystery.I do think it is worth the time to read, however, and I recommend it to anyone whose Stephen King collection is almost worn out."
1,No Adapter,"The description says it comes with a memory card adapter, but it does not. Amazon sent me this item twice, but neither one did."
1,Don't waste your funds. Keep searching.,"I teach a college/career Sunday School Class and purchased this DVD because it looked like a great tool for my class. What a waste of money. Just three people, sitting at a table discussing the Bible. There's no discussion material and it's incredibly boring to watch. Definitely not a tool for a Bible Study Class. Vey disappointed."
5,An Entire Evening of Bruce in a Box,"Great stuff, all in one place, an entire evening of entertainment in this set."
5,The Best Action Movies With Bruce Willis,"These Are Really Good Movies Especially The Third One and on DVD There Are Some Cool Features and Scenes In The Movie That Make Them So Good. Like Deleted Scenes, Trailers, an alternate ending for 3, and A lot of other cool stuff on these great DVDs That WIll Make Watch Them Over and Over"
5,What a Deal!,"Great price, fast shipping, great movies = Satisfied Customer. Other than the cheap cases this is a great product. Great conversion to DVD for an old movie as well :)"
4,Good Action and Entertainment,One and Three are worth watching. I had forgotten how bad Two is. This package would not suffer without it. I still think there are some scenes left out of movies on DVD. I first noticed it on Gladiator. Die Hard has some missing too. But these movies are still fun.
3,encouragement,"i just want to encourage you in all you are doing. and i pray the almighty to continue to strenthen you,asyou press forward.am enjoying your movies,but i will love to have your official magazine."
1,"stink, stinky ,over and over!!","it's the same story , trilogy same gimick,,diferent title, yepecaye mother father!!!!"
5,Excellent,Die Hard Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 - Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance / Bonus Disc)
2,"Great Movies, who's the swelled head that packaged them?","The Movies, what can I say they are great as always. The problem I have is the packaging. This collection of three Willis' films (6disks) takes up more shelf space than a five film ""007"" collection, or the 4 film (9disk) Alien collection. Now these are good/even great action flicks, but they are not 007, who has the swelled head in the production company?Guys, I do buy DVDs because the quality is better, I also buy them because they take up LESS shelf space. So lets get with it?"
2,not bad for its genre,"the silly action cop against all odds genre has almost been capped with the die hard movies. on par with the lethal weapons and 48 hrs, but nothing to write home about. probably the best thing about the movies are the villains. the directing and writing leaves some things to be desired"
4,Great for the money,"When I was buying this product I read the reviews. Many of them complained that the special features were not up to par with other versions released. But I went ahead and purchased this anyway, because it was on sale for $15. And for that price it was well worth it. Having never seen the other versions with the extra special features I don't really know what I'm missing. I took away one star because I noticed that the price has gone up again."
5,Probably the best trilogy ever,"Die Hard 1 is my favorite movie ever. Die Hard 2 kinda s**ked,but it's worth watching, and Die Hard With a Vengeance is almost asgood as the first. If you like good action movies, see these ones!"
4,All Three Deserve Four Stars! Beware of the 4th film though!,"This is a must have set for action genre fans. The hero is flawed but courageous and well-acted by Bruce Willis. The villains are all fun, ruthless, and different in each film. The dialogue is always fun and engaging, and the action is first rate and surprisingly believable although admittedly over-the-top at times. These films are why we go to see action films. The set is worth owning individually or as a boxed set, but beware that the latest film, Live Free or Die Hard, is fun, but rather disappointing souless in comparison to the first three.Amazon has all the details right in their review/comments on each film; therefore, I see no need to repeat them here. Bruce Willis is a very underrated actor who can easily move from comedy to action to thriller to drama seamlessly and without much effort."
1,Rip Off,"Don't waste your money on this for 2 main reasons:1) There are already better versions of each movie out already (or the already-existing box set). Each of those has 2 discs per movie while this set has only 1. The extra disc on this set is just hype for the new Die Hard 4 movie.2) Do you think the greedy studios WON'T put out a new Box Set with 1,2,3 and 4 when DH4 comes out on DVD? Please...This is nothing more than marketing; another double-dip disgrace (now, a triple) to take our money and spread the word of their new product.PS, I love the Die Hard franchise and can't wait to see the new flic. I just hate the studios and their never ending obsession with ripping us off."
1,Don't be a fool!,Don't be fooled into buying this boxset. It is a big waste of money. It doesn't have all the features of the old 2001 6 disc set. You might as well say it is a barebones edition of the movie instead of the old ultimate edition from 2001 that had two discs per movie. You want to get the real deal then get the ultimate edition on here and go to the used section. There should be some used ultimate edition boxsets on here. Possibly some that someone is selling unopened even. Those are the ones that have all the good stuff. This set is a huge slap in the face to fans like me and probly you that are reading this. Please don't waste your money on this set. Track down a copy of the old Die Hard Ultimate Edition set. You won't be sorry if you are like me and love bonus features.
2,Great movie bad sound,I bought these movies and thought it was great they were done in 5.1 sound and thx certified.. when I poped in the first movie everything was going fine until the sub(lfe) chanel came on the bass was up so high I had to turn the bass down in my decoder almost to the lowest to make it watchable.. good movie bad sound
4,1 & 3 are great but 2 needs a lotta work,"All three of the die hard movies have pretty good plots. All but the 2nd movie have great acting. All three are kinda out there(unbelievable, they never reload, the good guys never get shot, etc.) . Overall these movies are very exciting and entertaning"
5,Yippie Ki Yay Mothers!,"All three awesome action movies on one DVD boxset for your pleasure and need to feed on action.All three movies deal with NY cop "" John McClane"" ( Bruce Willis) who deals with many terrorist in a few cities yet he ends up being the hero. These are Kick-Booty Action flicks that will entertain and thrill you with their spectacular stunts and special effects including great acting and good scripts that make these films classics, all are must sees!"
4,Gotta Love Action Films.,"Whenever you think of an action movie, you think Die Hard. Finally, the film (along with it's sequels) has been released in some truly excellent 2 disc sets. Only the first installment is a Five Star Collection release, but it seems as if the sequels have more extras on them. The transfers look great and the extras are phenomenal(like the do-your-own editing workshop). This 6 disc deluxe boxed set definately beats out the original release a couple of years ago, which contained almost nothing on the discs. All of you action fans: buy this set now, before 20th Century Fox downgrades them to 1 disc releases again!!If you liked these movies, see: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, The Matrix & The Rock."
1,live free or buy this again?,"This is a money grab, absolutly right. Better editions exist and they will release the box set again with the fourth film included a couple of months after it's been available on it's own. Isn't that the formula these days?"
5,Best Bruce movie ever A+++,Bruce Willis is the best actor. He has that actors blood. I personally think Die Hard is his best movie except for Armageddon.
3,Die Hard DVDs Review,"The Die Hard DVDs that I have are not enhanced for 16:9 TVs, which is unfortunate, especially since they're presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio."
3,Sub-Par DVD Quality,"This review applies only to the Die Hard Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 - Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance / Bonus Disc) set.The movies are as great as ever. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the DVDs on this set. I purchased this to replace my old VHS tapes and was sorry I did. These are supposedly digitaly remastered and with Dolby 5.1, but the sound quality is terrible on disk 1 and disk 2. There is certainly no ""surround sound"" on either of the first two disks. I haven't gotten to Disk 3 yet, but I don't hold out much hope for it."
5,Finally!! The Best Action Trilogy in DTS!!,"The Die Hard Trilogy has been out on DVD for quite some time now, but I knew that my patience would pay off, and now, it finally has!! These movies are supposed to be watched with the best sound and picture available, and now, the movies can be shown -- and heard -- in all of their glory. The DTS soundtrack included on these films will make a world of difference, from the glass shattering in Die Hard to the plane explosion in Die Harder to the helicopter demolition in Die Hard w/ a Vengeance. The original DVDs were great -- but why just settle for ""great"" when you can have the best? These DVDs will soon be an addition to my library, taking their place nicely beside the DTS soundtracks of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series (sans Lethal Weapon 4) -- another action masterpiece. I urge you to do the same."
4,"""Molecules.""","Catcher in the Rye meets Dazed and Confused in this mordantly funny and visually exact film directed by Ang Lee (no relation to Spike) based on a novel by Rick Moody. Taking place over Thanksgiving weekend 1973 in New Canaan, CT--the town's biblical name is no accident in this tale of a genteel suburban Sodom--sex and substance abuse are the means by which two affluent families try to fill the moral void created by Nixon, free love, and TV. The kids act like adults and the adults act like kids, with neither group finding satisfaction. It is by turns laugh-out-loud funny (a junior high oral report on molecules) and squirm-in-your-seat uncomfortable (men and women face off across a glass coffee table at a key party) with a redemptive ending which through death and tears brings a modicum of meaning back into these otherwise empty lives."
2,Weird Movie,"This movie gave me the creeps. It has a very morose and dark atmosphere.Both adults and adolescent kids experiment with dangerous activities such as wife swapping and drug abuse.In one scene this teenage girl nearly drops dead from the affects of sleeping pills so the kid just throws her on the floor. In reality they should have called 911.I thought this movie had some potential and might explore some of those issues in depth and in interesting ways. Rather it is just a creepy movie about people searching for happiness in the wrong places.People need something to believe in in this world in order to be happy. They won't find happiness in extra marital affairs, alcohol, socializing, etc..Jeff Marzano"
2,DVD-The Ice Storm,"What an odd movie, how could you rate it as one of the top 10 movies for Thanksgiving? I would not recommend this to a friend, I was going to use it for some Thanksgiving Day movies for co workers and friends, not!!!!"
5,One of the decade's best,"Gene Siskel was dead on when he named The Ice Storm the best film of 1997. It's visual style resonates, and the performances are wonderfully true.Ang Lee's camera is respectful... it is easy to imagine the exploitative qualities this film could've undertaken with a different director, but Lee is (smartly) tender towards his hurting subjects."
5,An all too realistic look at disfunctional families.,"Ang Lee departs from the benevolent tone of his previous film, Sense and Sensibility, to direct a film that is not afraid to show what life was really like. Beautiful cinematography of bleak, barren suburbia that really works well in junction with the characters and the story. Terrific oscar-worthy performances by Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, and Joan Allen with great support from Toby Maguire, Elijah Wood, and Christina Ricci. This movie is for people who appreciate a little artistic vision. A terrific, yet tragic, ending that really sends a powerful message. A must see for all movie lovers."
3,Disappointing,"For such a renowned director, this film seems directionless and not that interesting. There seems to be more focus on period-specific sets than plot or message."
5,Well done Criterion,"The transfer is excellent, the extras are incredible, I especially liked the commentary track which made me appreciate this film even more. Well worth buying. Also, this is one of the rare occasions when a film based on a novel is actually better than the novel itself. While Rick Moody's The Ice Storm is an ok book, Ang Lee's The Ice Storm is a classic movie!"
2,Depressing & Pointless,"This was one of those movies that was meant to be meaningful but ended up depressing, cynical, and incredibly boring. It wasn't that the acting itself was bad. And it wasn't that I wasn't prepared to like this movie, because I really hoped to enjoy it. It was just another depressing, dysfunctional family movie. Wow...like I need to see another one of those. Besides that it's dull and depressing, it's really very unrealistic. In real life, people smile and laugh. I'm guessing people generally smile at least once a day. And even if there are unhappy, mean, self-absorbed people like that, it's not like that's what life is like. And if life IS like that for you, than you need some serious help."
2,Why?,First before I go off on this movie the acting was quite excellent. 2 questions to ask yourself before buying this. Will there be a plot? Is an ending a good thing to have? Answer number one: This movie had no plot jumping from one thing to the next for no reason. The comic books in the movie have more plot. The only thing that made this movie go along was that the train had a schedule. Please have a sequel to end this movie since there isn't one now. A final question is do we need teenaged nimphomaniacs. NO. My god I might have rated this movie a 3 if it weren't for that. If you don't think those were good answers to those questions well put in the context of a movie and you have Ice Storm
4,ice cold,"a great movie sometimes has a great cast and this one does. its shocking, powerful, disturbing and dramatic. its about messed up familes living in the 70's. the cast includes Sigourney Weaver(CopCat), whos having an affair with Kevin Kline(Life As A House) whos married to Joan Allen(The Contender) who the two have 2 kids Christian Ricci(Pecker) and Tobey Maguire(Ride With The Devil). Ricci likes to experiment sexually. Maguire goes off and has a party with Kaite Holmes(GO) and David Krumholtz(The Mexican), and Maguire has a thing for Holmes. Elijah Wood(North) plays the son of Weaver and Jamey Sheridan(tvs Law and Order:Criminal Intent). disturbing moments include Ricci and Weaver's son played by Adam Hynn Byrd(Hallowen:H20) in bed..."
5,The Ice Storm,"I would recommend it to everyone, provided they are of the appropriate age to view something with such sexual/violent content."
5,crackling humor and sad ending makes a great film,"after seeing brokeback mountain, i decided to see more of ang lee's films and came upon this gem that perfectly shows the same type of sad melencholy used in brokeback. the film takes place in the 1970's and centers around two family's the hoods (consisting of kline, allen, ricci, and mcguire) and the carvers (consisting of weaver, wood, and that one kid) who go through many events that boil together one night during an ice storm. the husband of the hoods is having an affair with weavers character, the kids are exploring sex and drugs, and allens character goes from shop-lifting to cheating on her husband too. the film plays out in two parts, the first hour or so is mainly a comedy while the last hour plays like a drama that leads to a very sad ending. truly a great ang lee film, must check it out if you loved brokeback."
2,An extreme disappointment... Except for Elijah Wood,"With all of the outstanding actors in this film, I was expecting something quite spectacular... and was sorely disappointed. The characters in this film -- with the exclusion of Elijah Wood's -- are ugly, boring, hurtful, selfish and brooding. Dysfunctional doesn't describe the families in this movie; these people are just plain sick. Archetypes of soulnessness, they spend the entire film invading each other's boundaries and betraying one another. Woods character -- a bright, endearing teen who sees the world through his own literary and artistic lens -- is the only highlight in the entire film, and fans may want to see this movie just for his performance. [Be prepared, though, his character doesn't survive the film.] Everyone else in the movie wasted their talent on decidedly repulsive characterizations. Gad, this was awful!"
1,"Without a doubt, the worst film of it's year.","If anyone says this movie is good, and for some reason, people ARE saying it on here, they should be locked up. This is a film with a storyline so friggin' boring I'd rather watch grass grow. Kevin Kline and Sigourney are fine performers, but there's nothing to this film that makes you walk away with anything but, ""What the hell was the point of that film?""Do yourself a favor. Skip this film. Buy anything else these actors have done."
1,Best of Intentions Gone Awry.,"As a book, Rick Moody's The Ice Storm was a fitting testimony to some of the harsh realities of being a `baby-boomer'. The indulgence, the confusion, the dysfunction--told with reverence, painfully, honestly. Good enough.But there's some artsy know-it-alls in New York who are just the right age, to have been on the wrong end of the 70's -and they further want to show us how bad they had it. They are selfish, small people. And we're so tired of their act, that we hardly listen to them anyway. So they scream louder. And we could really care less.So they make a movie about their pain. Which to them is the loudest scream they can make. And we really could care less.Wasted on this effort are some first rate talent, Kevin Kline should be perfect, as should Sigourney Weaver and Joan Allen, and as maestro who better than Ang Lee, the artisan to craft this work? All wasted.Instead of painfully honest, it's just painful. Stay away if you can."
5,Understated and scary,"The previous reviewer is dead on with the comment that Lee is kind to his hurting protagonists. This movie could have been another one of those 'we're so superior' sendups of an awful era. Instead, Lee feels sympathy for a group of people who were caught up in a time of such uncertainty. All the characters rise to the occassion to deliver graceful performances of confused people.This movie is darn good looking, too. The ice storm scenes were fantastic and just as I can recall as well. The hair styles, sets and clothes were accurate and not overdone - it makes me think more forgivingly of the fashion sins of the time."
4,Sizing a bit off -,"These are good gloves - good feel, quality materials and construction but the only hit I give them is they are sized a little larger than you would expect. You want a snug fit with a shooting glove and these are just a little bigger than the size states, and I have hamhooks for hands. ;-) I use them and they work, but would have preferred a little snugger fit. Nearly a 5-star product but for that."
3,Not real suede that I can tell,"The gloves fit ok, but I wanted thing and real suede for added grip with sweaty hands. These appear to be and feel like vinyl and do not help much."
3,A Christian understanding of the Hebrew Bible,"Sadly, this is the only book I could find on the topic. It is a Christian interpretation of the Hebrew Bible. The problem being that the Hebrew Bible is very cryptic and almost every good interpretation is done by learned Jews.Unfortunately, those learned Jews have opted to not go near this subject. Therefore, this book is the only book available.It is thought provoking, better than nothing, and clearly filled with misunderstandings of the Hebrew Bible."
1,Where's the music?,"In ""Tous les matins du monde,"" Ste Colombe tells Marin Marais, ""I heard every note you played, every grace note; I didn't hear the music."" That's my problem with this record. Where's the soul? The feeling? It's slick, it's glib, it doesn't grab the way, to name but one, Rita does."
3,Corrupted Persian Music,"I liked the more Persian songs on this albumn, but it heads off into bad american dance music. Could have been much much better. Plus Andy has a horrible voice in that If's But's and Maybe's song... albumn started out great though but ended up trying to rip off old Depeche Mode or something that just didn't work. Cheesey."
5,Heart Stirring,"The first time I heard this enchanting work of art, tears filled my heart! I felt instant connection! He reached into my far away 'inner world' and touched me."
5,take my breath away,"How do I begin? This cd is amazing. It is just pure love, peaceful sounds of love. Take you to its beautiful world. Anoushirvan is truly one of a kind. Who won't love his music? The emperor of love is breath taking and for the ones who know the song it brings back memories. A collection to cherish forever whether you are Iranian or not."
2,"Way over priced, but cute.","This is a trinket sized Bible. Printed in India, means it probably cost about 10 cents to produce. So spend your money elsewhere because this is way way over priced. Also, even though the title is ""LIttle Black Bible,"" they sent me a white one. Humph."
3,ehhh,A little too big for my liking. Fast shopping though. If you're looking for a tail that's like an inch big. This would be it... I was looking for something a bit smaller. Great kids necklace though and good price.
4,Snappy and catchy...,"This is well worth the investment. I have put a few of their songs on my YouTube videos, and have received a number of positive number of comments about their music. The amazon ""samples"" are excellent, and very representative of the music. ""Gole Sangham"" is stuck in my head!"
5,Perfect Interpretations and piano sound,"If my house was on fire I would grab this set, Beethoven's 28 sonatas by John O'Conner, and all my Tartini cd's!!!Anytime I can't decide on what I want to hear, I always put on Mozart's piano concertos.Murray is my favorite pianist for the Mozart piano concertos. His soft natural approach is poised against the reverb and acoustics of the piano creating perfection to my ears.I have heard many play Mozart well, but Murray is the best fit for me. Played at the right speed! Thanks Murray!The CD's did not all load on my computer properly. Some cancelled others out previously ripped when they were being ripped onto my computers (that's sad) !!Good day!"
5,All together,It is so very wonderful to have all of Mozart's sublime Piano concertos for piano and orchestra in one collection on twelve (12) CDs especially as fabulously played by Murray Perahia who also directs the great English Chamber Orchestra. It has been so very lovely for me to hear these delightful concertos again on these recordings that originally were recorded from the late 1970s through the early 1990s and remastered by Sony fabulously. The sound is great. Bravo Murray!!
1,sound quality is awful remastering makes sounds unnatural,i think murray perahia is a good pianist but this recording and remastering makes the performance intolerable to hearsounds like a pianoforte and in the bathroomvery unnatural compared to concert stagei would recommend new recordings made at 1980s and 1990splaying style is like gulda but gulda is better talented
2,great music-bad engineering,"The engineers at Sony have used the finest technology available today to ruin some of the best recordings of some of the best performances of some of the best music ever written.Across all twelve disks there is a piercing digital distortion in the mid-frequency range. Between about 2,000 and 8,000 cycles per second a nasty ring comes out and bites your ears off. it is so bad that some notes jump right out of the mix as if their volume were twice that of notes in other ranges. this is a real heart-break to me as I love these recordings. I do believe they represent the finest achievement of Murray Perahia's career. If you have the ability to re-equalize these recordings the offending frequencies can be lowered and this will make the listening tolerable.One should never have to do this. i believe that Sony is contributing to the disabled of Japan by hiring only deaf engineers."
5,Outstanding,"There are many excellent collections of these concertos, but, in my opinion, Perahia stands out as the pianist who can convey the passion, the drama, the joy, the sadness and the sheer playfulness of these masterpieces of the repertoire most effectively. I would certainly recommend this remastered edition with absolutely no reservations whatsoever."
4,Just Great ! Only one complain,"It does what its supposed to do... It looks great and it works... The only complain I have is that the middle tube can't be changed and that's a big problem if your using big tubes in the rest of the installation, because it makes the flowing slower, or maybe I think it does... But apart from that great product. Don't expect your temps to go lower, it's only purpose is to look gooooood! And it does !"
1,Watch out,"Tubing came connected incorrectly. On top of that, the tank does not work as a tank, for it has no filler hole!It may make my system look great, but that's not what I was searching."
4,I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BUT I DO,"I bought this album based solely on the fact that the video for party hard made me laugh. Not at the video but with it. It is refreshing to see someone making hard rock that isn't based solely on how painful their childhood was. Andrew wants us to party and I for one agree.It is true that at first listen all the songs do sound a bit samey but hell the first time i listened to psychocandy by jesus and mary chain i could barely tell they were songs. With repeated listens you start to pick up the melodies and pretty soon you can't help but yell ""I love New York City"" every couple of minutesSo stop being a stuck up indie kid and just buy the party album of the year"
2,Different Album than photo!,"Note that when I received the CD, it was a different album than the one shown. The cover photo indicates it's the electric blues album with 50 ""full-on electric blues classics"", but album shipped only has 14 tracks. If you look below in the description, it lists 14 tracks only. So wrong cover photo! For this price I'm not going to return it however... still good music!"
5,Be careful how much you pay,"Buy this directly from West, it only costs $17, and shipping is free.I've seen used copies for sale on Alibris for $270, and as far as I can tell they're identical to what's for sale at West, which is the publisher."
5,clarification,"Not to endorse the blue book, but to correct an error I noticed in one of the other reviews note that the California Rules of Court endorse both the Bluebook and CSM."
2,My comparison with other similar textbooks. Which I had used for exact class with different professor.,"This textbook, for me, I found it difficult to understand the instructions on how to cite legally the California primary and secondary sources. If I compare it with the out-of-state with this textbook, California Manual Style legal citation. I prefer to use the out-of-state textbook because it is easier for me to follow because it provide simple detail instructions. I think that the California Manual Style should be simplified for more detail, specific and clear examples for the readers to grasp the idea much better. Overall, it is a good source for the Legal Research class but not the best source for the class. That's my opinion and what's your opinion?"
5,Excellent film with excellent people,"This post-apocolypse picture features Kevin Costner (which we know to be quality material) as a scavenger who's story grows and grows to something quite large. The story goes from simple to extreme, and brings along a great cast of people. The villians are great, the heroes are great, and the suspense is great. The progression is done perfectly, not too fast nor too slow (though some might disagree during the middle of the film).The consistency is almost perfect, there being some unexplainable inconsistencies. But since you won't notice them having an effect on the story, it is almost obsolete. The epic vastness that the film reaches really gives a feeling of pride for these people. You have to see the film to understand it."
4,Great Movie - Don't believe the trash talk,I never understood the bad ratings this movie got. I thought it was very good. Maybe its because I saw it on DVD and not in the theater but this is one I watch over and over. Give it a try - you'll probably like it!
2,neat...but kinda foolish,"The future or the past? That's an interesting concept.But ... Why?A dedicated postal worker in an apocalyptic future meets ""Little House On The Prairie"".You may find yourself watching this Costner epic with a real synical attitude. There's a lot of ridiculous things to laugh about in this foolish movie."
3,"Please, can we have a directors cut?","Hollywood can really ruin some movies sometimes. I would like to see the original ending. I am sure that it would gain the other two stars. In this movie there are a number of intellectual points which seem to have escaped the published reviewers like Leonard Maltin. There was also a great deal of foreshadowing that just fell off to nowhere with the relining at the end. The filmotography gets all screwed up when the camera goes from glorious widescreen images to looking up the actors noses for a couple of the lines when it hadn't before. The ending got ruined by hollywood not Costner. This is a five star film with a one star ending which nets three stars. I watch it again and again, but when it comes to the ending I just turn it off and imagine what it should be."
3,POSTMAN,"These type movies are not for everyone, but I really enjoy them. Kevin Costner does a great job and makes the movie (the same as in Waterworld). If you like apocalyptic type movies this a good one and highly recommend it."
3,The First Time,"The first time I saw this and ""Waterworld"" I thought Costner had no business doing SciFi movies. I'm sure some thought that way about ""Robin Hood"" and ""Field of Dreams"". In each of his movies he doesn't quite seem on his game, but then there is something about each of them that draws you back. Perhaps it is because he isn't quite on his game, slightly vulnerable and human. Perhaps it is due to the fact there is so much trash out there, these are far better than them when compared. All I can say is I at first didn't own these movies and I wasn't particular impressed with them and now I do own them. I actually sit down and watch them and find them reasonably entertaining. They will grow on you if you give them a chance."
3,An under-rated film.,"This film suffered from the ""lets-get-stuck-into-Costner"" tall poppy attitude of the press after the equally under-rated Waterworld was unfairly attacked by critics(who called it ""a disaster"" and ""flop"",despite the fact that it made a profit).""The Postman""is a well made film.It is a bit overlong and I would have preferred a battle at the end,but it is still a good movie and this DVD has some good extras,such as a 10 minute documentary,production notes and trailer."
2,It's GOTTA be an inside joke,"Methinks Kevin Costner got too far into Tom Petty's bag of weed on set and went on together to demonstrate total contempt for filmmaking and audience so deep and pervasive that I have to give it an extra star for audacity. There is no other excuse for the mess this movie is. I loved the initial ha-ha...that a self help guru book breeds a group of fascistic barbarians in the post nuke future. If you're into cinematic masochism, you NEED to buy this movie and sit your friends thru it."
4,"I THINK that I want this DVD, but.....","I THINK that I want this DVD, but I'm still sour with Universal about the ""Jet Li's Fearless: director's cut DVD (in case you don't know, IT WAS NOT ON EITHER DISC, just the first two original versions, and they seem to not be willing to reemberse the money of the people who actualy bought it, so...I'm cautious.."
1,"3 hours, boring","Could have been condensed into 1.5 hours easily. Could have been great, love the genre but I kept having to fast forward."
1,Avoid Kevin Costner At All Cost,"This film is wretched. Basically, Costner puts a spotlight on himself for the duration of this despicable film. He sets himself up as some sort of savior, with the women in towns that he delivers mail to wanting him to father his children, and there is a huge statue built at the end of the film as some sort of tribute to his greatness? There is no plot aside from Costner wanting to reform the US Postal Service after its eradication due to war and convincing impressionable youth that the way of Costner is the one true way. I'm assuming Costner directed this one simply so he could trump himself up for the sheep that actually spent time to see this one in the theaters. Don't make the mistake that I did in watching this trash. Avoid The Postman and anything with Costner's name on it at all cost."
2,Cheesy Movie,"I wanted to give this one star at first, but then realized that wouldn't be accurate. It's not among the worst movies I ever saw, but my initial reaction was to say I hated it.Prepare to be bored and unimpressed with Kevin Costner, once again. If you do watch it, which I recommend you don't. This is just as lame as Waterworld.I will never watch this again for sure. Very boring. VERY unbelievable, sappy, formulaic, and very cheesy. Typical ""Be proud to be American"" sentimental drivel. Painful to watch most of the time. It seems almost like a kids movie, but that's not really what it's supposed to be."
4,Screw the critics. This movie is pretty good!,"I thoroughly enjoyed all three hours of Kevin Costner in this film. The acting was a little corny, and there were parts to the story that just didn't flow, but pretty much, this is a darn good movie. The fifteen minutes that Tom Petty had in the film were very cool, I might add."
4,Lengthy and Interesting,"Seems like most people giving the movie one star are those who read the book. I don't even know who the author of the book is, and don't care. I wanted to watch a movie, and this one is pretty good. If you watch it, you won't be disappointed. The good thing about on demand viewing, was I didn't have to watch all 3 hours at once. I liked many of the characters in the movie, but liked Ford the best."
4,Good movie.,"The movie starts out slow but is worth being patient. Really good, moving, thought provoking movie."
1,"I beg you not to watch ""the postman""","I am SO angry I have wasted THREE HOURS of my life watching this movie. I was convinced it was horrible by the first hour, but i was forced to watch the rest, since i was at someone else's house. It is STUPID, so UNBELIEVABLY stupid, and just when you think it won't get any MORE stupid, oh it does. It's corny when trying to be sentimental. The dialogue is insanely idiotic when trying to be profound. The plot is horrible, the theme is horrible. And it's just so damn LONG. I think Kevin Costner thinks he's made Braveheart or something. Kevin STOP MAKING MOVIES. People PLEASE DON'T WATCH THE POSTMAN.oh wait there was one good thing: Giovanni Ribisi. I love him, he's adorable."
1,Don't bother... violence against young adults is tiresome.,"This movie was entirely too long, and slow. I think Costner was trying to gain ""shock value"". The inferred violence against a mule and the depicted violence against children (younger adults) were completely uncalled for. If you're looking for a western, watch Tombstone (again)."
1,There must be a conspiracy...,Something fishy is certainly going on if the average review for this movie is 4 stars. This is truely THE worst adaptation of a novel ever made. Costner should be tried for crimes against cinematography. This movie is far beyond AWFUL!
1,Hard to believe people actually like this.,"By the 3.5 star average The Postman has from viewers, it's obvious it has its fans. But I must say, this is a terrible movie. There's a lack of anything interesting, save cinematography and an interesting premise. Everything else is mostly flat and dull, resulting in a true corny bore."
1,"No sir, I didn't like it...","I wish the postman would send me a rebate by mail for the nearly three hours of my life I threw away watching this piece of junk.With few redeeming qualities, Costner's The Postman is the epitome of the majority of films that Costner has devoted himself to over the past decade. They're all hollow, quirky, and boring attempts by Costner at being an everyman just trying to fight his way out of some lame situation and happening to come out on top, and with the girl, no less. With other actors, this approach works and the audience can empathize; with Costner, you find yourself anticipating your next bathroom break.Return To Sender."
1,there is no hope,To all those people who gave this movie more than one star and said that it was a tale about hope:If you liked this movie THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE FOR YOU OR THE HUMAN RACE. THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY MADE MORE THAN TEN CENTS SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO HOPE FOR AMERICAN CULTURE.
4,All I can say is I like it,No Offense to professional critics and writers but i see many appealing elements of this film from a literary prospective as well as an entertainment one. Watch and judge its appeal according to your own tastes.
2,Not just inferior to the book ...,"Not only is the book much better than the movie, as is almost always the case, but the movie is also an insult to the book. The book has a lot of intelligence and insight, whereas the movie practically makes the entire story into a series of lucky happenstances.In the film, the villain is turned into a one-dimensional stick figure. This is enough to ruin the story by itself, but the movie's omission of the ""oracle"" subplot removes any source of wonder or realization. It's just another overly long, moody, Costner-saves-the-world-mostly-through-brooding picture.David Brin, I'm sorry that Hollywood didn't do your book justice."
2,the ending is spoiled already.,"I don't hate this movie, but I do hate the way it ends. I won't tell you what happens, but ask yourself, have you ever seen a movie that culminates with a good guy showing mercy to a bad guy, and then the bad guy shows his gratitude by promptly endeavoring to kill the hero? This way the good guy looks really really really good. And the bad guy looks equally bad. Like I said, I don't hate the movie, but this gigantic monument to cliche at the end is the part I remember most clearly."
1,Worse than Waterworld,"Its baffles me that anyone could think this a 3 star movie, but 5 stars? This plays like a hodge-podge assembled from two or three different scripts based on different short stories, with casting giving it a PC spin, probably done to try to deflect the deserved harsh criticism. Of course, the entire story of the savior postman is enough to make most sane people embrace the apocalypse.Perhaps if Tom Petty had starred as the singing postman it might have worked better as an intentionally funny send up of pop culture fashioning new messiahs."
4,Where's the dts version?,"This is a great film as most of you have said before me, but the sound was so compressed with Dolby.When are studios going to use some of the time they take to make a blu-ray disc better, better? Pleasetake the time and do it right, either dts or uncompressed."
1,"PRETENTIOUS, PATHETIC, UNDILUTED CRAP","I shouldn't even be giving it one star. Don't get me wrong. Despite all the bad reviews, I thought WATERWORLD was still immensely enjoyable. But POSTMAN is so full of crap, you have to smell it to believe it. There is no salvation here for Kevin Costner here. It's hard to believe the same guy who made DANCES WITH WOLVES would sink so low."
5,Costner's Vastly Underrated Classic,"This movie is fantastic. It's great. It's a big Hollywood movie that is about something great. It's nothing like you've ever seen before. Costner has a great vision. His girlfriend in this movie is hot, hot, hot! Will Patton is one nasty bad guy, but I kept remembering him from No Way Out and snickered a bit. All in all, screw the critics and see it for yourself. If you've already got your mind made up from listening to the critics, forget it. Go in with an open mind."
3,Kevin Costner,"Though I admire Mr. Costner' performance, I am very uncomfortable seeing him pairing with an actress young enough to be his daughter."
4,worth watching movie,"when i read in a magazine about the new ""flop movie"" by kevin costner. i decided to watch it at once. a long movie but it keeps you stick to tv until you finish it.a very good watch for all those who want something different. i enjoyed it thoroughly"
3,its not all the hype built it to be,"the novie was good, its not slow i enjoyed the entire thing.costner can really act.!"
5,"A beautiful, inspiring American epic","I've just seen ""The Postman"" for 6th or 7th time, last night on cable, and it keeps getting better every time! Forget the three-hour 'price-tag', this is an intelligent and engrossing film. As usual, I don't understand all the negative reviews from movie critics... where do they get their credentials, anyway? With its combination of action, drama, romance, patriotism, and even comedy, ""The Postman"" rises far above most of the meaningless tripe released by the film industry these days. What must a movie have to receive critical acclaim? What this one doesn't have is the constant barrage of filth, so many screenplays seem to rely on to cover up their weak plots. There is violence and brief nudity, but neither is too graphic, and it only serves to strengthen the story.Hats off to Mr. Costner for taking a chance and giving us such a wonderful film."
4,Good feeling movie,I had read the book before I watched the movie. It was loosely based on the book but I think the movie was better. The ending made me feel real good about the future and humans in general.
3,The Postman knocks twice,"I ordered this movie because we were in the area where some of the scenes were shot. It was fun recognizing the backgrounds. The movie was better than I remember when I first saw it. Costner seems to play flawed heros well, he was basically pushed into his ""hero"" role in this movie."
4,Kevin costner movie,"I was thrilled to find this movie, it was a gift and they had been wanting this one and couldn't find. thanks"
1,Perhaps the worse movie Kevin's ever made,"If you thought that ""Waterworld"" was bad then you should check this out and add it to your list of the ""stupendously bad movies"". I formerly worked in the Post office for 13 yrs and I decided to check this out on DVD then on TV--and the result was the same. It was so boring that I found myself dozing off and the idea of postman being the savior of the world, well, it's gotta be a joke particularly for a former employee of it!! The usually reliable Will Patton is so over the top as the villain that he makes Dennis Hopper (Waterworld) look like Laurence Olivier!! Fortunately for Kevin he would redemn himself a few years later with a minor hit: ""Open Range"", a classical Western if there ever was one, and with a great Robert Duvall to boot--Kevin even gave him top billing over his name which was fabulous. I say skip this turkey and check out ""Open Range"", ""The Bodyguard"" or even Costner in a supporting role in ""The Upside of Anger"" with Joan Allen."
1,"This ""movie"" made me sick !!!","Kevin Costner have made a crime against humanity. The real mistery to me are those numerous ""patriotic"" Americans who suport this attack on mental health. God save America from Costner because Allah probably won't..."
1,It sucks.,This one will go down in history as one of THE worst wastes of money to have ever been spent in the film industry. Do not go near this one with a 20' foot pole.
1,The worst movie ever made,"It really is.I'm not going to waste my time writing more, but I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie if I were you either."
2,Good Book - Bad Screenplay,"I guess I keep hoping that Hollywood will get science fiction right. With few exceptions I wait in vain. David Brin's book is an excellent work which I remember fondly long after reading it. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't even come close. Kevin Costner's direction and acting is lackluster. The screenplay is miserable. It's a shame, really, since I was looking forward to seeing something from a ""real"" science fiction author converted onto the screen."
4,What our future could look like,This may not be Kevin's finest piece but as a whole the movie is truly inspiring.The Postman [Blu-ray]
1,Garbage,With the exception of The Island of Dr. Moreau - this is the worst piece of filth I have ever seen.
5,Wonderful!!!!,There is only one word to describe this movie: FANTASTIC! The storyline was excellent and the picture and sound quality blew me away. I reccommend this movie to everyone!
1,Horrible Movie,"Don't waste your time even considering watching this. Drawn out. Boring. Not worth it. Go watch something else like Dances with Wolves, Waterworld, or JFK if you want to watch a Costner flick."
1,"Dull, dull dull","Watch this if you suffer from insommnia. My postman is more intersting as at least he has something worthwhile to say usually. The acting is poor, the plot and script even worse. Why did they bother. I suspect Costner's ego and bank balance both needed filling. Avoid like ""Analyze This"""
1,Read the Book,"One again the movie makers have taken a wonderful book and carved, maimed it up in the name of Hollywood. Spend your money on the David Brin's book, not this movie."
1,Postman=Post Mortem,"How the [heck] did this film ever make any money? I love Kevin Costner. His roles in Robin Hood and Dances W/ Wolves were humorous only when it was written to be so, rahter than his whole character being a complete joke. The worst part about this piece of scum is that it never ends. My friend and I had to beat the crap out of each other to stay conscious. The villain/general, whatever he is is so scary. This movie would have been more entertaining if you saw all of the characters suffer a painful disease all in one sitting. If I ever see this title on a strangers, or God forbid a friend's DVD rack, I will discreetly place it in the trash and write them a check for their trouble. Not even worth an empty star if it were possible to do so."
1,Amazon screws customer again,"Is there any point in pre-ordering from Amazon? In instances such as with THE POSTMAN, they show the price at $ 17.99 and you make the mistake of ordering it. They then lower the price to $ 14.99 a week later, but still two weeks before the item ships. Do they give you the lower price.....ARE YOU CRAZY? Then one week after it comes out, it is now $ 12.99. Conclusion. For reserving a copy with Amazon, the customer pays more than anyone else. This is done over and over and over by Amazon, or atleast as much as their wallets will allow."
2,actually as pathetic as our real ones,"drags on, virtually plotless...0 character development...ridiculous plotline, followed by an ending as sudden as it is absurd. it can be said that the beginning is no worse than confusing. it raises the question, what is this story going to be about? within the next half hour that question has been resolved. answer is nothing at all. tries to be worse than waterworld and does manage that."
4,WORTH THE PRICE,I CHOSE THE 4 STAR RATING BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH...YOU CAN'T GET UP AND LEAVE FOR ANYTHING.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE TO REALLY STAY AND WATCH THE MOVIE OR WATCH IT SEVERAL TIMES IF YOU DID GET UP AND DIDN'T PAUSE IT.
4,gr8 flik,nice one to watch if ya bored an got nothing else going on. highly recommended to cure that boredom ness
5,The Postman,This is by far one of my favorite futuristic movies to watch. Kevin Costner and the less of the cast are great. I was so glad to see it in Blu-ray.
2,Not Worth 3 Hours,"How does the human race begin to civilize again after WWIII? This movie still has no clue. I'm among few that thought ""Waterworld"" was a great film. There was no cheerleading, pep talks, and idealism in that one. Today it seems laughable that scavengers would mourn the corrupt US government and find inspiration in postal delivery. The love story doesn't work. The villain doesn't work. Even a child could see the script was far too long. The last scene is beyond silly."
4,Ignore the Critics,"I've enjoyed this movie so much over the years that I found myself adding it to my personal DVD collection - and I am very selective in what I add. Yes it's long, but it's also exciting, moving, and inspiring in turns. This is a movie that features adventure and explores themes of courage, commitment and patriotism. It's also the best movie Costner's ever done."
2,"Too darn long, and Costner has the charm of a wooden totem p","I saw this movie only when the local video store had run out of copies of the more recent hits that I went in there to rent. Overall, I would say that the plot isn't all that bad, it's just that the theme is basically ""The Road Warrior"" set in the Pacific Northwest instead of the sandy desert.There is an incredibly boring and almost unwatchable love scene that eats up about 45 minutes that I'd rather spend watching Barney videos with a bunch of three-year-olds, because after about 5 minutes of that particular scene, we GET THE MESSAGE that Costner's character is falling in love. No need to drag it out further.All in all, without that scene, the movie would have moved a lot quicker and perhaps not garnered the horrible reviews it received."
4,This Kevin Costner apdaption could save his career.,"Kevin Costner found the David Brin book and turned into a 3 hour film, And it could had saved his box office career. Costner is a Drifter without a name, An Shelter seeking Con-man of a devastated America, He discovers a Mail Man's uniform and decides to re-store the wrecked country, and Combat General Bethelem and his Hell-born Holonists."
4,"Plausible, exciting and interesting","Despite what critics have said about this film, I think it's terrific. It shows in great detail a plausible world of the future, where society has completely crumbled in to a new Dark Ages. People are ruled by fear, and even the most rudimentary comforts are treated as luxuries. One of the most heartbreaking things about this story is that many characters have a memory of what the US was like before the catastrophe occurred. You can see fragments of the world that was sticking out of the dirt and grime. It's a fantastic story about justice and compassion winning out over might. The cast is great, the philisophy endearing and the photography is quite lovely. Forget what you've read about the movie, and allot three hours to just enjoy how vivid the world it creates is."
3,To those who haven't seen it.,"If you haven't seen this movie, go rent it, watch it, and form your own opinion. If you don't like it, so what it was just $3 bucks and one evening of your life. If you do like it, go rent it again, or buy it and add it to your collection. The one thing that makes this a good movie, is that you can get lost in that world, and you can relate to it. People have differant opinions, and taste. Thats one of the things that makes our country pretty great. Don't judge what you will like and dis-like on the taste and opinions of other people, and least of all ""critics"". Why do people expect all movies to be blockbusters. Some movies are just for those who can connect with them. Some are not written to be blockbusters. If you liked ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Waterworld, you'll like this one too. It's classic Costner."
2,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK TURNED TO HOLLYWOOD S**T,"My friends and I were elated to hear the news : a David Brin book was being made into a movie, and it was the Postman!!! We were so hyped to see the adaptation. We sat in the theater, watching, with a gradual numbness creeping in to our brains, as half an hour into the movie, one of us turned to the other and asked, ""Have we gotten to the book yet?""""Nope"", came the whispered reply.Folks, this movie may seem passably ok to most of you, so I can't totally trash it...but please, even if you don't normally think of yourself as literate, go read the book by David Brin, a gifted author, instead of this 'adaptation' by a director whose better works seem now to have been flukes. You won't regret it. But you may come to hate this movie."
5,A Movie for Everyone,"This is a fantastic movie for absolutely anyone. If you like romance, the story includes a beautiful storyline for the romantic in all of us. If it is action you seek, the bold battle scenes will leave you clinching your pillow. It's got drama, suspense, action, romance, and yes, comedy as well. This movie is a must-see for people of all ages, male AND female. SEE IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY! Cheers to Costner for this truly spectacular performance."
1,The Post Apocalyptic Boredom,"I had to write this review when I saw that there were several people actually rating this film at 5 stars. Seriously you should take your pills and your friends in the white coats will be coming by later on to check on you, until then please refrain from using your PC as we are all in danger of the obliteration of good taste.The Postman is a very boring film with terrible story line. One of the most conspicuous flops of the decade and there is good reason for it. Kevin Costner plays a drifter who tries to unite isolated communities to fight against an oppressor by reviving the long-dormant postal system. In other words this a boring post apocalyptic science fiction story about a man who delivers a bag of post for three hours."
1,So bad ...,I love post apocalypse themes ... this is so bad. Kevin Costner is just what you'd expect. Corny cornball cornation corniness corn.com
2,The only thing worse than the post-apocalypse...,"Wow, really consider not watching this movie. I'll watch anything post-apocalypse themed, and the idea here, of rekindling a mail/communication system in a destroyed society, is very interesting... it's just this movie does such a horrible job of it.The upside is very beautiful cinematography of the pacific northwest, and lots of great assemblage of post-apocalyptic cavalry that are worth seeing."
3,A sentimental 3 stars,"Dammit, I keep pulling for Kevin Costner. He deals in big, big themes: Waterworld, Postman, and, of course, Dances with Wolves. I like a guy that goes for the big ideas and huge Hollywood productions. But the bottom line is Mr. Costner can't edit a film worth a tinker's damn. Also, he is just plain soft at the center and shockingly politically correct, which leads to some truly god-awful dialogue. This film has, at least, an interesting performance from Will Patton, who plays the movie's villain as though constantly wired to an electric charge. The hell of it is, I have liked Costner in his smaller roles, such as the tiny gem, A Perfect World (which boasted one of Clint Eastwood's most effective and understated performances to date) and Silverado. What the hell. It's worth a rental."
3,Not great but so what,"Not every movie is Citizen Kane, but so what. This is a popcorn movie, pop some, sit back and wonder if this couldn't be true someday, one man stepping forward and stitching together a country, even unintentionally. This movie shows how an idea can be a beacon for others. We seem to show each year that the critics may hate a movie, but Mr. and Mrs. Joe Viewer find something they do not. If you like alternative history (or in this case alternative history yet to be made) check this one out."
4,"A magnificent, but underrated, performance by Costner.","The Postman is a story of an educated man in the post-nuclear world. Decicing to observe life rather than live it, the man keeps his distance at all costs. Almost. When himself and his mule, Bill, are forced either to earn food or starve, they go into a nearby town. The town is ravaged by a group of bandits and he is taken by them, to become oe of them. His hatred grows untill he escapes. He takes a postal uniform from a corpse to keep warm, and finds himself a founder of a orginazation that gives prople hope. This is the story of a mans rise from nothing to the savior of the people from the opression of tyranny. END"
2,definitely post-apocalyptic...,"...and yet as bad as the film was, I liked it. No, Costner can't do Shakespeare, not even a little. No, General Bethlehem wasn't an interesting villain. The film dragged, the Postman spent nearly all of it on the run and at the very end magically appeared with an army behind him, and Tom Petty's part was funny (such a stoner) but too short.For me, what worked was the theme of a man who doesn't believe in himself working miracles partly by deception and partly by being misunderstood and idealized. I liked the struggle with which the Postman finally takes on the mantle of responsibility. I liked that the enemy movement was called ""holnest,"" a logical outcome of our manic obsession with ""wholeness."" And I liked the gun-wielding girlfriend.Seems like we could all learn from the new ""Rule One: No More Killing."""
5,the postman,"Good movie. Once again Kevin has a unique way to venture into the future of ""what could be"" and bring a bit of reality to the adventure. He was able to keep the story very real with out vulgarity or brandish nude sceans. Very good movie!!!"
4,Really not so bad after all,"I'm being a little generous here (really 3 1/2 stars), but critics obviously had it out for Costner on this film, regardless of its merits. I don't consider myself a Costner fan, but this film is perfectly entertaining and I never found it dull. The script is laughable in spots, the acting lukewarm, and the patriotic leanings are definitely ""aw shucks"" (very Costner!), but overall The Postman succeeds as a perfectly watchable epic. I liked Will Patton's ruthless General Bethlehem a lot -- he succeeds as a loathsome, megalomaniacal villain. This movie is actually better than Waterworld, Costner's other post-apocalyptic film."
4,Another Classic Kevin Costner,"Ok first this isn't as good as Dances With Wolves or Water World,but it shares the same epic story lines they did,and was done right,it deserves 4 stars.Kevin Costner was very good doing this type of movie.Yes it could of been better,but I still enjoy the apocalyptic story line,yes they could of sold the story better,but they made it believable,as believable as any other movie.To further say anything would be a spoiler in a way,but if you like Costner's other epic movies you most likely will enjoy this one also."
3,It's Entertainment!,"The Postman delivers solid entertainment with original story line, spacious western settings, and innovative adaptions to a post-cataclysm America. It is just the thing for a kick back evening. You wind up relaxed and feeling better than you did. Of course, it is always a good sign when you start thinking about a second viewing at the conclusion of the first."
4,An exceptional epic !,"At first I was a bit hesitant to see this movie because of all the bad press and reviews it received. I was surprised and delighted to find out it wasn't horrible or corny. This film is incredibly well written and the acting is very entertaining. Don't listen to the criticism. See it for yourself, you won't be sorry!"
3,This Movie is Very Enjoyable,"I found this movie to be very good. Throughout the picture i was rivited to the screen. The story line is very well done, it starts out a little slow, but builds nicely to a wonderful and complete ending. However, I did feel that the ending was a little contrived and could have been a little more realistic. I also felt the movie was a little too long, it could have been done just as well at 2 hours. Other than that, I would say go buy it, rent it or get to see it any way you can. Well worth the trip."
4,"It is a classic epic, a complete story from beginning to end","Costner has created a real hero. As with many real life heroes, this one is created mostly by accident. The Postman begins as a humble traveling storyteller and ends up being the story. The common people are looking for someone (as we always are) to lead them out from the post war chaos. While the antagonist wants to impose a dictatorship on the people, the Postman becomes, by accident, their hope to restore the United States of America. In the end, it is the people who make the Postman a hero, and in that one critical moment, he answers the call. It is a truism that our heroes are usually not all the bad things they did but their glorious moment in the sun."
4,A good movie,Despite the critics thumbs down on this movie it's still interesting and entertaining to watch this nearly 3 hour movie. END
1,Snore,"The Postman was way too long, boring, and the plot was quite, well, pathetic. Sorry, this movie sinks as low as a movie can sink. I admire Kevin Costner's performances, but even he couldn't save this snoozer. The Postman is a movie not worth making in the first place. I left the movie theater halfway through the movie and got my money back, and waited for HBO to air it to see the end. I shouldn't have watched the end, you can tell what it is at the halfway mark in the movie. The plot is so incredibly thin that it makes the plot of Bloodsucking Freaks look ingenious, and that's not saying much. If you can't stand boring, plotless movies (who can...) don't see this (this means EVERYONE! DON'T SEE IT!)"
1,This movie is a complete waste of time.,"Midway through this movie, I felt like ejecting it from the VCR and throwing it out the window. I could have saved myself 1 l/2 hours or sheer boredom had I done so. The acting was not believable; the plot was heavy-handed; and the dialogue was worse. The only reason I am giving it one star is that zero is not an option. I used to be a big Kevin Costner fan, but a few more movies like this one and I will not only not go to the theatre to see his movies, but I will not rent them either."
1,you will repent!!!,Dont watch. dont waste your time. no review to be written for this. just wanted help other guys by rating one
1,Nap Time,The Postman was one of the worse movies ever produed it had zero story zero plot the acting are terrible and I found myself wanting to turn off the DVD and break the disc. Defeninately one to stay away from END
4,the postman dvd,I ordered this just before Christmas and it came within 4 days. I was happy with the DVD when it came and it was all that the listing told me it was. A movie well worth watching and one of my boyfriends' favorites....Merry Christmas!!:)
5,Amazing Item,"This is a great item. The panel saw stays in square and gives nice clean cuts, even when rip cutting. It is also nice not having the saw dust blow back in your face. The dust collection is amazing."
3,"KONICA MINOLTA 1250E, 1250W TONER CARTRIDGE","Good product, meets expectations - though arrival was bit late"
2,one of the gayest songs made,eddie murphy and michael jackson was both in denial about their sexual preferences and this was evidence ironic that this was made before mike was accused of pedophilia the firsat time but then eddie was always into drag queens.
4,"jWIN JTP330BLK Big Button Corded Phone with Flashing Ringer Light, Music on Hold (Black)","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCSYHY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis phone doesn't have a Music on Hold feature that I can see on the phone unless it is done with a call waiting feature. But there is no hold button. The manual says, ""When in an office equipped with PABX, your unit makes it easy to transfer calls."" It then gives instructions but never states while they are holding to be transferred they are listening to music unless that is what the PABX does.I was disappointed that this phone didn't have a hold button that offered a melody. That was why I bought this phone.Lorraine"
4,"This book Rocks, I love it!","Just recieved my book today and, after completing the first chapter on perspective, I can honestly say that this book is very cool ane useful. I can't wait to work through the other chapters in this book, especially the chapters on shading and reflection.Not all the advice may be useful, but the book covers the essential fundamentals on perspective that you MUST use when drawing automobiles.The artwork shown in this book is from various professionals and may frustrate some artists who compare thier work to the pictures shown in the book.Drawing automobiles is difficult to do well. Takes much practiceHere is my advice on using the book. Take your time, work through the chapters and use only the advice that works for YOU. Your drawings will not look like the ones in the book as everyone has thier own unique style."
5,It DOES teach u how to draw cars!,"I'm sorry for writing a 2nd review, but i just want to say that I disagree with the previous review saying it doesnt teach drawing cars. This book has a part about each of the important subjects on drawing cars, all the details that you need to know.And I made a huge progress with it.My website has the drawings which were done after the purchase of this book. When I compare the ones before with the new ones, it makes me laugh.You dont just start drawing perfect cars after u read this book, it takes time and lots of practicing. Do you expect to be drawing like Thom Taylor just after u read it?!... Take you time and patience, lots of it. And thats all you need.And at the end of the book you see the artwork, by the best car artists. Which is great..."
4,Surprisingly good,Motorbooks tends to put out some pretty skimpy titles. Lots of flash and little substance is often the case. This book seems to be an exception. As a total non-artist this book really helped me develop some skills in the area of automotive art.A lot of good information without a lot of opinion. Nice drawings for you to use for reference and motivation. Good coverage of the different types of media.I'd buy it again.
4,A Great Book for Car Drawing Tutorial ...,"I find it that this book covers most of aspects you need to know to draw cars ""properly"". I recommend this book for anyone wishing to learn or hone their skills on car drawings, because it is quite difficult to understand such thing for some people like me :D"
5,3 LARGE LP4 INTERNAL POWER ( PYO2L ),StarTech.com 3 LARGE LP4 INTERNAL POWER ( PYO2L )Fantastic! I finally able to get the additional hardwares running with this power split connection. The price was very good comparing with others...
3,ZigView-S2 Type B Digital Viewfinder for Nikon,"Pros: It is a great idea, good device. I'd rated at 5 stars.Cons (which down rate the device):-A little part of the eye piece adapter AZV3051 is already broke off. Adapter's material should be stronger.-Before mounting on the camera colors are vivid. Subjects' colors are weak after assambling.-Screen size adjustment is difficult. It requires additional info or lessens even for extra money.Conclusion: Regardless of cons I am widely using The ZigView-S2 and happy that there is one. Improvements would make the device much more valuable."
2,Cute but sizing was wrong,The outfit that I received didn't come any where close to fitting per sizing information.I think that they put an XL tag on a L outfit.I was able to have my dog wear it by just using the neck connection and made it like a cape.
3,"Polished, pretty pop ballads.","Her most pop-oriented offering before ""Grease."" Mostly slow songs and sad songs, including the beautiful ""If Love Is Real."" She gives a stunning rendition of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina,"" probably one of the vocal highlights of her career. Only a few country songs here, including an infectious remake of Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire."" Olivia wrote one composition, ""Don't Ask A Friend."" It makes you wonder why she didn't write more of her own songs earlier."
3,MAKING THIS ALBUM BETTER,"Okay,it's not Livvey's best work,but the title track is one of Olivia's best songs from a vocal point of view,if what you like best about Olivia is her sweet pure voice than this is the album to have. One of my all time favourite Livvey songs are on thist album""Sad Songs""."
3,"Contract filler, couple of highlights","Good, but not great music by numbers exercise churned out in 1977. Shame about ""Argentina"" as it was recorded before the eventual ""definitive"" version by Julie Covington was released, it could have been big for her. The title track makes the album worthwhile, the rest of just easy on the ear"
2,A CONTRACT FULFILLER,"This album came between her early country-pop phase and GREASE. It seems to me that they put this album together with rejects from earlier sessions from other albums. It just doesn't have the quality that one would expect from ONJ. It's not a total loss, though. ""If Love is Real"" is a fairly good ballad and her cover of EVITA'S ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" is one of her best vocal moments.All in all, as a fan, the only reason to have this album is that it completes her catalog. If you are looking for ONJ at her best check out the albums that came before and after this one."
3,Pleasant Without Purpose?,"While she sounds very pretty and pristine in the ethereal range, this material isn't as carefully chosen as for other albums. ""Slow Dancing,"" ""Ring of Fire"" and ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" have had stronger, more dynamic interpretations by other artists. Some tunes here are nice and pleasant but not especially memorable. Even ""Coolin' Down"" isn't quite one that you want to hear over and over again. She may have an angelic voice, yes, but one that on this album rather lacks a mission or an intent."
1,These hooks are unusable,"I bought these awhile ago. I wanted to use them for deadlifts and 400 lb shrugs. I realize the shrugs might be over-doing it, but my deadlifts were a moderate weight. In both cases, the hooks slipped,and as one other person mentioned, they failed one time. Sorry, I can't recommend."
1,not well designed,"I bought 4 pairs of these -- one for each son. We had been sharing a pair that finally wore out after 10 years -- the name had rubbbed off so I am not sure what the long lasting ones were. These Valeo hooks are not designed properly. They do not have an open enough curve to fit around the slightly wider than barbell handles on machines, and the hook is too long relative to where it attaches around the wrist. They were cheap in price and the performance followed. We do not even use them."
4,Valeo Weight Lifting Hooks,"Great product-great price. I wear these to reduce the fatigue in my hands while strengthening with several universal weight machines. They are good for ""assisting"" while lifting light weights. I wouldn't rely solely on them for heavy lifting or in place of using my hands."
4,Good hook,"It is a nice product to use for some rutines that require pull ups or some dumbells.Very nice, it serve is purpose"
4,does the job,"I wonder why it's black. Wouldn't it keep the baby cooler if it were a somewhat reflective color? Regardless, it seems to do its job well. I wish the company had made it zip onto the sunshade, instead of covering it, so I could use the peeking window. I like that it has 4 snaps on the bottom. I use a plastic clip from Ikea to hold the extra fabric together when I'm not using the double."
4,"Dark, Thick but effective","Again, Phil and Ted never include instructions so its up to you to figure out the nuances of putting this thing on. At first, my toddler was a bit scared to be covered by this large black blanket like material (she sits in the front) but soon discovered she liked ""hiding"" behind it. The cover is LARGE and when you no longer need it, it secures in one of the side saddle bags (another accessory) easily. Getting it on takes a few minutes so just hope you have the 3-4 minutes to snap it back on when you can. This isn't for short trips. This is better for those longer trips when you know you'll be walking around a lot with the kids (i.e. theme parks)."
3,Just OK,"I was very disappointed in this. I like Holly's voice, but the songs are just so-so. I expect that any Holly fan would enjoy having this, though. It's just not for me."
3,Doesn't quite do it!,Shipping wise the DVD arrived USPS timely and undamaged. The DVD playback was flawless and of good quality. However the subject matter left a lot to be desired. I found it too belaboring and the little stuff and somewhat confusing in other parts and I've played the guitar before awhile back. It'll teach you the basic chords and such but not in a very motivating way. Bottom line. I'd seen better instructional DVDs then this one.
2,I cant learn on an Electric Guitar !!!,"I bought this video thinking it was super basic. Mayby i cant learn guitar, but i thought a begginer should start with an ACOUSTIC guitar."
3,"It's The Pictures, After All","The photographs within these covers are gorgeous - it's a perfect souvenir of Paris. In fact, if you buy this, you can think about leaving your camera at home. The text, translated from the French (original title 'Art de Vivre a Paris') is a bit gushy, and you might wonder, as I did, how much has indeed been lost in the reinterpretation. Never mind. Living In Paris has been in and out of print, so when it's available, get it! It's still cheaper than taking 5 rolls of your own shots to the Fotomat. And these are the pictures you'll wish you had taken."
5,The Next Best Thing to Being There,"Beautifully illustrated, this book takes you on a well organised journey through the main districts of Paris but also informs on a differnent asthetic level such as the essential spirit of this city as seen through its architecture and its culture. The grande old history from the baroque and ancient regieme onwards is elegantly sought out with a particularly interesting chapter containing old master craftsmen at their trades and where you might find them. This is a book that you can simiply sit down with and devour in a glutonous way. I found this book, when sitting in one of those well heeled, and gracious bookshops, that sell good coffee and deadly cakes! Long story short - Amazon to the rescue and I am now enjoying the glories of it's pages right from my armchair. For anyone who plans to visit Paris (like myself)and/or anyone who loves things of days gone by, and wants to do so in thier mind.... give this a look. It's cheaper than an airfare and nearly as good."
3,informative but...,"The pictures that are featured in this book is pretty out of date. People who are shown in the pictures seem like they are from 1970s. But other than that, the book is filled with informative stories about Paris so I quite enjoyed reading it."
5,Will be indispensible to exhausted parents,"As far as I know, Durand's book is completely unique - there are no other books specifically on coping with sleep problems in children with special needs, even though they are unusually prone to developing sleep problems (which are also not always susceptible to the methods designed for ""normal"" children).Durand's advice is built on a solid foundation of research, but written clearly and without jargon. He's also not out to ""sell"" a particular method or program as the cure-all: he describes a number of different methods, giving the pros and cons of each, so that parents can make an informed decision about what is likely to work with their child.Incidentally, the information in the book might also help an adult (disabled or non-disabled) sort out any sleep problems of theirs as a free bonus."
5,Such a life and marriage saver!,"we had been struggling for a couple of years with our daughter's sleep issues and read and implemented some other books and suggestions early on. this book seems to have finally lead us to the solutions. it caught our interest because of the 'special needs' in the title. we were able to pick two of the recommendations and alternate them, depending on the situation. unfortunately, her issues are re-occuring, but we now know we can work through them and that is a tremendous weight off of our shoulders! we have shared the information about this book with our autism doc, too, hoping he passes the title along to other struggling parents!"
2,"Meaningless, Empty and a Waste of Money","This Cd and all their Cds are so void of any artistic and musical value and depth that even 2 stars is giving them too much credit. Guys, go back to your day jobs!"
1,packaged without protective film on dropper,"am sending this back because bottle came with dropper totally unprotected. twice! first i thought was a mistake and sent back and they sent me a replacement. exactly the same deal came again --- bottle has no tamper-proofing of any kind. none.i can not give my pets something that came from unknown source OPENED.if tamper-proof packaging is what you expect, look for this product somewhere else.can not recommend because of this."
3,Didn't do much to help my dog.,"Bought this for my dog who has Cushings Disease in hopes that it would help boost her immune system. Well this stuff didn't do anything to help reduce repeated infections due to the Cushings. Not saying that this product isn't effective, it probably works fine for pets that have a mildly depressed immune system. But for severely depressed immune system, this does not work."
1,Poorly Made,"In less than one week, the wallet began to show signs of wear. Chaffing around the edges, and wearing away of dye on leather. Would not recommend!"
4,Motor Sports History was Made,"I've only been a Formula 1 fan since late 2006 (drawn in by the Schumacher - Alonso battle, and totally hooked since), so I've been watching these season review DVDs to get caught up on background, etc., as well as passing the winter off-season without experiencing total withdrawal symptoms.By 2008 standards, the features are a little lacking ... you can play thru start to finish or play the individual races. Inexplicably, the video of the fastest qualifying lap doesn't play when you show the event, you have to play them separately.Content wise, whether you were/are a Michael Schumacher fan or hater his domination of the 2004 season is awesome. This is when he won his 7th and final World Championship."
4,Great Formula review,"Im big Schumacher fan and this season was so great for Ferrari. They made all records!! Picture is good, commentary is nice. What I only marking litle minus is digital 5.1 sound missing."
3,"Harlequin Triple Feature, Vol. 3 (A Change of Place/The Waiting Game/Diamond Girl)",I enjoyed and was entertained by this DVD. I remember seeing it on cable and decided to add it to my romance collection. Thank you for the availability.
3,Enjoyable remake,"This 1959 remake of The 39 Steps does not really deserve the scorn poured on it by critics. Of course it's not Hitchcock, but Kenneth More makes a surprisingly charming hero, and the movie has the advantage of tons of gorgeous Scottish scenery.Where it doesn't work is where it borrows directly from the 1935 film, but otherwise this is a fairly entertaining romp. Look out for several pleasing cameos from familiar British character actors, including Brenda de Banzie, Sid James, Joan Hickson and James Hayter, among others."
4,I love it!,"This laptop is for someone who cares about the look more than anything else... i can tell this laptop is very sinsetive and you'll have to take care of it and treat it as if its an expensive peace of glass, so be gentle with it.i bought this 8 month ago and until now i didn't face any problem with it. sony is a powerful company. you never regret what you spent. & i highly recommand this product :)"
3,Surprisingly impressive,"The Z1A is very portable and stylish. Performance is very good even though it's only 1.3ghz, it outperforms 2.2ghz notebooks in my kind of benchmarks (doing side by side comparison). The screen is kind of small and I was outraged by the fact that it doesn't accept Sony Memory Sticks that have capacity larger than 128mb, unbelievable! I would really loved to use a Memory Stick that's widely available in 1gb size.After some extensive use, I can say the Z1A is worth being in the +/-[$$] price range notebooks, the rest I guess is for its style."
1,Awful keyboard layout,"I thought this would be an awesome laptop, but after starting to use it, I discovered that the right shift key is the same size as other keys, with the result that I would too frequently hit the up arrow key next to it.The shift key design was critical enough for me to take it back to the store.I ended up with the Apple 12"" Powerbook, which is the best laptop I've ever used."
1,A low quality game,"I was very dissapointed when I started playing this game. There's little in the way of goals, little detail, and long moments of boredom and frustration.The first thing that fools you is the character art on the cover. The actual character sprites in the game look like those plastic toys that come with legos and the rest of the game is equally as unimpressive. I liked the idea of designing a character with stats and such but I never really understood at the end what made every character so special. All I seemed to do was run around and bop monsters.I rarely give bad reviews, but in this case I son't want a consumer to be fooled into thinking they're buying a game on par with a lot of the other anime-esque RPGs out there like Final Fantasy. This is really just a mindless game of 'kill the monster' and 'follow the leader' as you wind your party from encounter to encounter. Unless you can buy this game very cheaply it's really not worth your time or your money."
1,This is total [garbage]. Go buy Final Fantasy 7/8,"Oh how I wish I could curse in this review. It would makeexpressing my feelings so much easier. I will sum them up now. DON'TBUY THIS IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY. After ten minutes with this game you will be ready to scream, vomit, and break the cd into many small little pieces. The graphics are terrible. The story is bland. The battle system [is lacking]. There isn't even good collision detection. Your party will bunch up until it looks like a huge piece of Fruit Stripe gum. My real score is a quarter of a star which they get for including a functional uninstaller."
1,not worth it,"this game is outdated. console limited, wobbly, and it had no detail. i played for 45min and put it back in the box. i enjoy over head scrolers like legend of zelda and final fantasy, but this game has no flair. of cource i took it back and baught fallout2&1 pack. i was much more satasfied then."
5,Pat McCabe + Neil Jordan = incredible movie,"One of the best book-to-film adaptations I've ever seen. The narration is handled brilliantly, preserving much of the sinister charm of McCabe's narrational style."
3,A SNOWBALL IN HELL,"I had read positive reviews of this picture, but I just could not stomach it. The boy in the picture is just too rambunctious, too loud, too over the top, too much to handle. I guess that is the point, but I just could not handle it. I was pleased to see Sinead O'Connor as Mary (yes, Biblical Mary)-clever casting. Steven Rea was excellent as the drunk, depressed father. Not at all a happy story."
2,Why are the real sick minds allowed to make movies?,"This astonishingly sicko film is all dressed up in an ostentatious veil of socio-political comment in a masterfully deceptive attempt to justify unabashed glorification of violence, delinquincy, and nearly every form of perversity imaginable that the film-makers so enthusiastically endorse. This is a terrible shame, too, because of the spellbinding performance of young Eamonn Owens. I mean, how often do we see a child in a larger-than-life role--and pull it off so remarkably, to boot? Of course, the fact that his performance IS so appealing only adds to the dangerous effect that this latter-day ""A Clockwork Orange"" contributes to the increasingly bloodthirsty appetites of today's youth."
1,A barf inducer,One of the most horrible films I have ever seen. I didn't expect to be disapointed by such a wonderful director and set of actors; but the story is simply gross.I'm sure the kid actor is very talented but I hated the character he plays. Everyone is repulsive in their own special way.Don't watch this film while eating anything - or if you want to keep your food down in your stomach.
2,Full of Sound and Fury,"This is one of the most incomprehensible, indulgent movies ever made. It is full of sound and fury with endless shouting and swearing in impenetrable Irish brogue. Nobody's actions make any sense. If you like vandalism, perhaps this movie will appeal for its defecation scene.This is a movie for bigots who hate the Irish and want to see every negative stereotype about them on screen."
5,Dark Brilliance,"A film of dark humour; typically Irish with all the associated peculiarities. Alcoholic parents, small village life, aberrant clergy, teenagers growing up (or not), all set against the anxiety-filled zeitgeist of the cold war nuclear threat.Neil Jordan's directorship does a great job of portraying the fine lines between darkness and the humour; the reality and the fantasy; the sanity and insanity. Eamon Owens is nothing short of brilliant as the lead character.A highly under-rated film. With better marketing and distribution is would have been a blockbuster.See it and tell your friends about it."
4,Deep Film,"This movie actually starts off kind of slow, BUT once it get going it actually get very good.This is a Haunting tale of a young boy names Francis Brady from Ireland. He goes through alot of emotional problems as a young boy and seeks help from the virgin Mary who is played by the gorgeous Sinead O'Connor. Sinead plays this part perfectly, especially with the abuse she experienced in her childhood....Eventhough, this movie is very serious, it has a light hearted feel about it but this doesnt take away from how powerful this film is. This is one movie where you will say ""Wow"" at the end. A MUST see film! Oh, the soundtrack is quite good... If you like Sinead O'Connor, she performs ""The Butcher Boy"". Nice little tune I'd have to say."
5,It's about time,"I've been waiting for this movie for ages,It's incredible that it took 10 years to finally come to DVD.I loved this movie,if you haven't seen it and like films like Heavenly Creatures you're going to love this.I just hope the DVD edition does justice to the movie"
5,It is a very good movie. I like the way it starts & ends.,"There are very good actors & actresses. The way movie starts, it lets you know that you're in for a real good treat."
2,Not Cracked up to what it should be,"I rented this video expecting something more interesting. Instead, all this movie provides is thick Irish Accents, an annoying child, and an extremely slow moving plot. The cast was wasted in what could have been a moving, intelligent film. Instead, poor direction and an unimaginative screenplay bring this film down into the depths of doom. I would not recommend this film, to anyone."
2,Does not make you sit up,"I waited and waited to be drawn into this story. It didn't happen. I have sat entranced through MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, so I have an open and generous mind for a movie --- but Butcher Boy did not work for me. Some boyhood-surrealist themes work ---- CINEMA PARADISO-- but with those you know you are watching surrealism; Butcher Boy never establishes its genre.I also am uncomfortable with the movie's un-judged acceptance of a boy ""hero"" whose response to a father's brutality is to adore the father and glibly rechannel his true feelings into brutally murdering another woman --- hello? I thought we had dealt with this kind of neurotic evasion a long time ago. Nothing I saw in the movie suggests that Neil Jordan is conscious of what he's saying."
3,Good little TV - but don't put it in the bedroom,"I bought this little TV for use in the bedroom and I am very happy with the picture quality but the sound quality is a problem. The TV is used very late at night, when the house is absolutely silent so I keep the volume quite low so as not to disturb anyone. At these low volumes, the distinct BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ that comes out of the speaker makes it hard to hear the TV show I'm watching. It makes the TV unusable under these conditions.People that use this TV in a family room, with the volume turned up to normal listening level, would probably never notice the annoying sound.I rated it a 3 because of the good picture quality and the abundance of input choices (even S-Video)."
1,Teach me something.,"By the time you think he's finally going to get to the point he's left it hanging and moved on to more of the same endless rambling.I don't know which is worse reading this book or reading this book after reading his previous book.The author goes out of his way to avoid getting to the point.This is a free publication. So do yourself a favor and read a few chapters off Gutenberg . org first to see if you can tolerate his writing.""He was not a good lecturer...Crane was only bearable when he took up the chalk and showed what he meant on the blackboard.""The way he speaks was hard to bear then. Let alone read now."
1,No Illustrations :(,There were NO pictures or illustrations at ALL when I tried to view this on my Kindle Fire. :( Rated 1 star for disappointment yet again.
5,Hands down the best metal record in 2006!,"This is unbelievable! Never before have I heard such a brilliant combination of sophisticated intricacy and brutal outbursts of fury. This is on par with bands like Dillinger, Cult Of Luna, Rorschach, or Mastodon, without copying them in any way. You might actually be disappointed if you expect this record to sound ""like Mastodon"", as some people say. To me, this is the same league, but an entirely different sport. Hope there'll be a US tour soon. Can't wait to see them..."
5,Very Consistent album!,"This album rocks!! Listening 'Aeolian' is like a mix of Neurosis/Isis with Meshuggah and TDEP(the dillinger..). Such a lot of powerfull riffs! With this album, TOC, proved to be one of the new great bands immerging in the hardcore/metal scene! My advice to you: BUY IT! If u like Isis, Neurosis, Meshuggah, Old man gloom , Mastodon, Norma Jean you'll like this album for sore!The singers Tomas Hallbom (Breach), Nate Newton (Converge/Old Man Gloom) e Sean Ingram (Coalesce) participated in this album."
5,brutal!,"Surprisingly heavy death metal that ranks among the finest ever. Heavy, very well produced, an assortment of vocal talent, what's not to love?"
3,CD somewhat of a disappointment...,"After having heard Andrew in concert several times at Club Passim and LOVING his songs, I finally broke down, spent the cash, and bought this CD. But he's so much better live! The spunk and personality which Andrew brings to stage is somewhat lost on this CD. Also, there were times I had to skip a song here and there b/c he was so off-key, it was painful. This isn't true of his live performances!!In any case, Andrew is a gift to folk music, a spectacular performer with phenomenal stage presence that can get any crowd going, and I look forward to many more of his shows!!"
5,A must have for anyone who wants to do well in precalculus,This book is a life saver for any one who wants to brush up their precalculus skills or even for beginners. I would strongly recommend it!!
3,Just ok,The different layers of skirting is nice. Not sewn well - strings everywhere. I listened to other reviewers and bought a size smaller. Fits well.
5,Great Service/Great product,"I bought this for my daughter for Halloween and, of course, she's been wearing it anyway and having a blast. It's lightweight which is nice for the little girls, but not cheap quality like other costumes she's had in the past. I would recommend this product."
3,barely lasted a day,"No doubt that the costume is extremely cute, my daughter loved. But the material is pretty cheep and the costume fell apart in a few hours of usage (the skirt came off). My girl was so upset that I end up buying real fabric for the skirt and redid the costume."
2,"Runs Small, Looks Cheap, Not Durable","I wish I could say better things about this Snow White costume, but it only lasted a few hours before it began to rip...Not to mention the cape part of the costume at the neck was frayed when we opened the package!! For the price, its ridiculous! Try Little Adventures instead - their dresses are MUCH more durable and run the correct size. Ours is a Toddler 2-4 and on the package it states it fits between a 1-2 year old! Wish it would have said that on Amazon's site. Save your money. not worth the price."
3,Cheeeeeeeeeeeap looking,"This custom looks so cheap I had to staple the cape, but I am glad to said it was well worted the price I paid for I got it on sale for [...] and my 5yrs old wore it two days straight, went to school on Friday didn't take it off for two days now is just a rag in her closet. I would sertainly don't advice anyone paying a full price for it!"
4,"Very nice, good price but get a smaller size","This is a very nice costume for the price you are paying. The fabric is very pretty and it is well sewn. The only big draw back is that it is very big for the size it shows. I bought a size Medium for my daughter that is 6.5 yrs and uses size 8 in clothes and I should have bought a small. The length of the skirt was to the ground, but the major problem was fixing the top part so it wouldn't look too big. I did read this in one of the reviews but didn't pay much attention... I wish I had and then would have bought the small. It would have saved me a lot of time figuring out how to fix it! But it worked out fine, and my daughter simply loved it, specially the cape which is not common to find in Snow White costumes."
4,Brightly colored and fun!,"Really fun for my 3-year old. Went with the toddler size which was fine. My daughter is 37 inches and 29 pounds. She is pretty petite, so this worked out perfectly for her. It is not the most high quality, durable material, but fine for every day play."
1,not the size advertised - about 3 or 4 sizes too big,This dress was advertised as a size 4-6 for kids (or a small in kids clothes size). It was irregular and HUGE -- would probably fit a 9 or 10 year old very wide child. The disappointment was pretty strong as it was a birthday present for my daughter who wanted to wear it to her birthday party. I am going to return this.
4,Good Quality for the price,"Got this as a Halloween costume, and it is sturdy enough to live on in the dress up box. Looks just like the picture, and we haven't had any problems with ripping seams, etc. One note is that the netting on the skirt is covered with glitter sprinkles which shed. My daughter literally leaves a trail of golden sparkles behind her :) I store the costume inside out to avoid a mess."
1,Poorly made,This dress is extremely poorly made. The elastic in the sleeves was so tight that my skinny 5 year old couldn't get her arms in the sleeves. The front of the dress gapes and is extremely low cut. The velcro was missing in the back. The fabric snags sooo easily. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a dress that is going to last.
2,Ripped in an hour,"Did not expect high quality, but it ripped within an hour of her first wearing it, would only recommend if child is going to be sitting totally still and not actually playing in it"
3,Pretty but tears easily,"Tears very easily. But it's a beaustiful play dress. The top layer will not last long, it tore the first time it was worn."
4,Great reference for new black belts in TKD.,This is an excellent resource book for new black belts in TKD and those blacks belt hoping to advance in this sport (TKD is not an art anymore)it is also helpful for those new instructors with a text outlining the forms required for advancement. GM Chun compiled an excellent resource at the time of its printing. It is worth while owning if you teach TKD or are a low rank black belt.
4,"Pretty, but is it enough?","These 3 friends are so pretty, and I love how they all look so different from one another. The raincoats and boots are bright and adorable. And the umbrella (it comes with only one real doll umbrella) is cute. But my problem is that the dolls are nude under the raincoats. I really wish there was some simple outfit underneath so they can get out of the rain and take their coats off, then put them back on to go back out into the rain. I know this will bug my daughter, so I'm debating about giving this to her or returning it. But the 3 friends are so sweet and pretty, I don't know if I could bring myself to return this cute set with such nice bright colors. I just think not having any outfit on under is a problem-- and it reminds me of a 'flasher'!!"
2,Steven Cojocaru is a nice guy but this book is [bad].,"I don't think even one editor at Ballantine ever read this book before it was sent off for printing. There are typos everywhere and there is no overall theme to tie these random chit-chatty stories together. A few of his stories are funny, but for the most part, this is a total yawn, and the celebrity bits are skimpy and boring. Steven Cojocaru's life, on which this book goes into a fair amount of detail, is also rather uninteresting. I got this for free at the book launch in Beverly Hills or else I never would have bothered. Don't waste your money on this. Check it out from the library or wait for it to come out in paperback. There must be better tell-all glamour-world books out there."
2,Yuck,"How did this thing get published? Steven Cojocaru looks like a chicken that has just undergone shock therapy and he's actually mocking other people's fashion sense. When I saw the cover I thought this was satire. Alas, Cojocaru is writing in all seriousness.The book tells the story of how he, a nobody with questionable taste gets to interview celebs and mock them. Steven Cojocaru's life story isn't interesting, his gossip is stale and his observations aren't particularly enlightening. This book will be on the 99 cent rack in 6 months. If you've just got to read it now go to the library."
1,dreadful just dreadful !,how did this book get published ?the opening chapters are good it then turns into a tedious name drop session that is neither bitchy enough nor funny enough to be interesting .get yourself a copy of INSTYLE instead !
5,It's just a book,"I have been reading the other reviews and every one who disliked the book needs to relax. If you didn't like it, you didn't like... that's what makes horse racing. I however, was entertained and found the book quite funny, perfectly matching COJO's television personality. It's an easy read that I really enjoyed. It's cute and funny and does not deserve the harsh response it has received on amazon.com. Great beach reading...nice job Cojo."
3,Cute as a pair of Pradas!,"Some witty, funny stories and insights from the glamorous red carpet world. That's pretty much all this book has to offer. The rest of the space is the tale of the author's attempts to make it in Hollywood as...whatever it is he is. The major flaw of the book is the fact that Steven put himself into it way too much and for such a colorful person his life story is far from the autobiography of a starlet. Honestly you read more about what HE'S wearing than what the stars are wearing. And he's not the best writer in the world. BUT, he is funny and the little quotes and anecdotes on the book jacket are enough to rate this materialistic fluff 3 stars. But Steven should definately not quit his day job."
4,Red Carpet Diaries: Confessions of a Glamour Boy,"I enjoyed this book. It was written in a rather simplistic style, but loved his comments. Steve gets up close and personal with celebrities. I really enjoy seeing what they wear and Steve's comments are too funny. Would have liked this book to be twice as long. The insight into Joan Rivers was probably my favorite part of the book. Glad I bought it."
1,"Trashy .....and poor photography in ""wanna be book""","I flipped through the pages upon receiving this book. The black & white photography was poor quality. The few colored photos, which were bad, were of the AUTHOR... which was odd, considering the book was supposedly about all the people he met in the business. It began with a chapter about the author, which I had no interest in reading. ... I flipped through the pages & immediately realized it was not what I wanted. I packed it & sent it back, not wasting the time to read it!"
1,Not worth the money,"I am very disappointed in this cookbook. If you are looking for a cookbook that has innovative, interesting recipes for food that people with diabetes can eat, save your money and don't buy this cookbook. A number of the recipes require either a food processor or a blender. Many recipes require extensive prep time. The author's idea of dessert is to eat a piece of fruit."
5,A Book MBAs Cannot Do Without,"John Pearce and Richard Robinson presented a very clear mapping of strategic management concepts, as well as their design, realization and measurement. Nevertheless, I would suggest the latest edition (i.e., the 10th Edition) which emphasizes more contemporary conceptual tools and skills that are required in the field of strategic management. The book also comes with many Business Week and strategic management cases from the trenches. [Nwankama W Nwankama]"
5,Great things come in small packages,PROS:-big screen-if set to high sharpness it takes amazing pictures-very small-simple to use-fast start up-lightweight-attractive design-comes with a dock-movies go as long as there's free space on the memory card-movies with sound-many sceen settingsCONS:-the screen could be better but it's still pretty good quality-no carrying case-average picture quality...which is now a problem for me because i'm getting more into photography...This camera is definately worth the $220 that I spent. (walmart.com)
5,Hilarious,"Eddie Izzard is fantastic. Somehow he got thimbles, James Bond, Pavlov, and the military career of Hannibal into one set and I laughed all the way through. An extra special treat for Anglophiles."
5,Beautiful and Solid,"I've had these tables for the past 7 years and they are amazingly sturdy and beautiful. I'm not sure why the seller lists them as oak--they are NOT oak--they are a gorgeous stained pine. I was looking for pine and they came up. The drawers are perfect for remotes, magazines, TV Guides, DVDs, and/or wireless video game controllers. These tables mastered my ""Mountain of Junk on the Coffee Table"" problem, they have held up amazingly well given the price, and they are lovely (unless you think you are getting oak).I don't know what the flaw was in the other reviewer's situation, but mine were perfect."
1,3 pc dark oak finish coffee table & end table,"When we opened the box with the table, instead of it being oak it was more of a cherry wood. Also the coffee table had a deep flaw on top of the table. Someone had to of seen it because it was stained with the flaw. The following day we sent it back to the vender."
4,Good product for the money,"Good and cheap too! No issues with it quite yet, although I'm a little concerned with the stitching. I love that this was made in the USA."
3,Horrible Guitar Mix!,"This is a cool little dvd, very scaled down skynyrd show. Seeing Needle and the Spoon was worth the purchase price for me. However the guitar mix is jaw droppingly amateurish with Gary Rossington's guitar totally lost in the mix. Even when he's playing the opening of Freebird, you can't hear it!Ricky and Hughie's guitars are loud and clear but it's as if the producers totally forget to turn Gary up in the mix. Having said that you'll hear Billy Powell's keys loud and clear. Probably just about worth the price especially used."
4,Better than most,"Although I would agree that this is probably the best book to begin your study of quantum mechanics with, there are still serious flaws with the book. I just finished taking a class that used this text and I found that a major problem is that it never actually 'get's to the point.' Instead of telling you how to apply a technique to solving problems, the text simply assumes that you'll be able to figure that out yourself. So much of the notation goes unexplained and important points go unemphasized. I would suggest using this book if you're a first time student of quantum mechanics but supplement it with another book that explains how to do problems (Liboff or Griffiths)."
3,Average,"This book is pretty average. It doesn't generate much excitement about the subject, and it really doesn't give as much detail as it should. This book *should* be seen as an introduction to an introductory course in quantum mechanics. A better, albeit more expensive book, is the one by Gasiorowicz or Griffiths."
1,Learn Quantum Physics from Eisberg and Resnick.,"I disagree completely with the previous reviewer. When I took my first quantum physics course, we used this book and I found it largely incomprehensible. Too many concepts were not explained adequately, and the presentation of the topics lacks logical progression. I found Eisberg and Resnick a much better introductory quantum physics text."
2,Read this to miss out on Quantum Physics,"I used this book for my intro to Quantum Physics class at Cornell. Although some of the problems are nice, the book itself blows. The topics are not covered in depth at all, kinda reads like an outline of another book rather than an independent textbook. So many topics are missing or the important parts of topics are just ignored (how can you not cover electron spin precession!?!) Well all I gotta say is that I wound up reading Feynman's Lectures On Physics and Eisberg and Resnick instead. Eisberg and Resnick is one of the best books that I seen on an intro to QP(it is very wordy, but you get all the nice detail, be it hard or easy). So I can't say F&T is a good book, but I'll give it 2 stars for the problems."
4,Not bad for what it is,"What this book is NOT, to be clear, is a good read-aloud. It's tedious if used that way.What it *is* is a good, step-by-step instruction of a basic science project for little ones. If you use it that way, reading every step as you go through it and not before, it's wonderful.I find the reading age suggested on this book (3-6) to be a little young. Try 6-8 instead."
4,Bring your egg carton and learn!,"My daughter does like this book quite a bit. I was looking for a book we could just read at nighttime vs a book that included a science project of growing bean seeds.She did learn from this book and does request it even without our bean seeds, so it was worth it."
3,Nice,Book was good... not great.... easy to understand. But seemed a bit trite. I think you could do better with another choice.
4,Durable,"Bought this for the kids over a year ago. They got tired of it quickly, of course. But it still works, and nothing broke. Pretty solid construction."
3,Air hockey fun but flimsy,"This was last year's big gift for the grandkids ages 4 and 9. This ""mini hockey table"" operates fine and was fun for a while. We tried using it on the floor, but it really needs a table the right height for players. It appealed more to the four year old. The little baskets for the pucks are really flimsy and were pretty useless-not sturdy as pictured so we chased after pucks a lot."
1,"This is a joke, right?","Can't believe this sexist stuff--""Stay until you physically deteriorate."" ""Put on your prettiest makeup."" (Oh, so THAT'S why my husband is a jerk? I'm not wearing enough makeup?) ""Keep your weight in check."" As if I've not been doing that all along? Then he complains about ""a new diet this month."" What drug did you guys smoke out there in California that helped you ""create"" this? Look, I know people worked hard for this book and the garbage before it, but really--after all these years to make marriage somewhat equal, do we have to go back to being Donna Reed and doing housework in high heels? Gimme a break! Thank heavens I got this on sale--I'd hate to think I paid full price for this cr!p."
1,not well made,THIS IS THE 2ND ANKLET I HAVE BOUGHT THE 1ST ONE LASTED ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND THE 2ND ONE DIDN'T LAST A DAY. I WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO PURCHASE THIS ANKLET EVER. STERLING SILVER CELTIC CLADDAGH CHARM 9 INCH FIGARO ANKLET.
2,glad it was a borrowed book,"cause it's definitely not a keeper.Of the two stories - sunlight and moonlight - moonlight is the better.Sunlight is your ""i fell in love with a space alien"" story. Trite, too fake religious, simplistic, and really not fun enough to excuse it.Moonlight is a vampire story, and is a bit better. If the romance had been left out, it would have actually been good. All this effort is spent telling the story of the vampire - his origins, his character - then it's all blown to crap in a silly little tryst that is not at all believable.not really worth the few hours I spent on it.(...)"
2,Sunlight - Boring; Moonlight - Somewhat intriguing,"This was my 2nd Amanda Ashley book. The first was such a disappointment, I almost didn't read this book, but I had purchased them at the same time. Sunlight seemed heavily borrowed from Starman (movie and TV series), thus lacking much in the way of originality. Lainey didn't impress me, and, while I did rather like Michah, I couldn't get engaged in the plot (which included a rather bizarre evil scientist, and characters that didn't really 'fit'.) I ended up skipping to the end without feeling I missed much in the middle. Moonlight, on the the other, started off quite well - the birthing of the vampire was novel to me. 2000 years later, however, the contemporary story was rather pedestrian, mared by Andrianne naivete, and Navarre's goodness. (None of the torment of Buffy's Angel, for example) I did, however manage to read this through."
5,- The Awakening -,The 15 second principle is one Man's mission to realizing and ultimately preaching via simple demonstratable lifetime experiences - the nuances to achieving 'freedom' or 'nirvana'. The absolute undeterred zeal to sharing his wholesome wisdom as he helps humanity awaken from mediocrity and self restrain.
2,Title is misleading,"This isn't a bad book, but it wasn't what I expected. From the title, I expected that the book would be designed for people who are short on time--written concisely and able to be read in short chunks. However, just leafing through the book you can see that there is page after page of solid narrative. There are almost no concrete ideas for what to do with little bits of time one might find. I have bought several books of this sort lately and would highly recommend purchase of The Now Habit by Fiore instead of this title."
5,Tripled My Effectiveness!,Awesome book! I used the ideas about the Pleasure Priority to keep relaxed--not attached to the outcome--alternating between precision/relaxed and non-precision/relaxed; never do I enter the world of tension! WOW what a concept! I am closing THREE X's as many deals and having a blast--sales were never like this before! Great Book. Wonderful Ideas. Very well laid out. I look to Al Secunda's next project with anticipation!
2,Speck Skin Tight for Myfi,"Don't plan on using this skin with your car dock or home dock. And removing it and reinserting it each time you take it back and forth is not going be easy. Good otherwise. It's either always on, or useless."
4,Excellent Downtempo,"This album has a sweet ambient, chillout feel. It has nice Indian vocals thrown over downtempo beats. Perfect for relaxing in a lounge. DJ Pathaan blends the music together smoothly. So very nice!"
3,Ro-D-Ys - 'Take Her Home' (Rotation) 3 1/2 stars,"Sixteen track compilation of this late '60's Dutch psych band's repertoire. Believe the Ro-D-Ys have two proper releases out - 'Just Fancy' ('67) and 'Ernest Vocation' ('68) + two compilations. One, of course being this CD and then there's the fantastic 'Complete Collection' 2-CD that I liked much better (see my review). Tunes here that make this title a should-hear are ""You Better Take Care Of Yourself"", their should-have maybe been a national hit ""Take Her Home"", ""I Still Got You"", ""Nothing To Change A Mind"", ""Unforgettable ""Girl"" and the semi-stunning ""Winter Woman"" (definitely, one of the CD's best songs). Recommended for fans of the Outsiders (the Dutch band, of course), Q65, the Creation, The Smoke and The Birds."
5,Great item,Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to work with. Not bulky like poly. Excellent price compared to fabric stores at home. No prewash required
3,Memoirs with attitude,"For those who like to read and write quality memoirs, the best thing about the book was its introduction -- which makes the point that quality memoirs are ""post-therapeutic"" and dwell in ambiguity. Too bad too many of these memoirs fail to live up to the guides Stone set for herself.The best memoirs here were the least sensational -- Lopate and Texier's detailed, anticlimactic stories of their fathers and families were head and shoulders above the rest. Some inclusions, like Lois Gould's, were well-written but did not really stand on their own. The worst were the most sensational -- Terminator's silly cartoon sex comedy, which sounds too fabricated to ring true. Stone's own entry is credible, but when she starts going into her own sex life, I just went into snooze-a-thon mode and flipped the pages until she started talking about human nature again. Why do these ""hip"" writers love sex so much and do such a bad job writing about it?"
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This is without a doubt the absolute worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to buy. When they cut that beloved little dogs throat and drained the blood, I wanted to throw up. That was when I ripped it out of the dvd player and put the movie where it belonged. The garbage can."
5,Fine Supplier,This supplier provided the book as advertised. The book arrived quickly and in great condition. There were some minor markings inside but nothing that made the book difficult to use.
5,Life-Changing Supplement!!!,"My life has changed and I have not felt this wonderful in a very long time!! Since using Thyromine my energy level has skyrocketed, my brain fog is gone, and I've lost 15 lbs in 6 weeks!! I have hypothyroidism and was on Synthroid for 15 years. I recently replaced Synthroid with Armour and have incorporated Thyromine into my daily regimen. I'm looking forward to losing even more weight."
2,THYROMINE HEALTH,"THYROMINE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT & WEIGHT LOOS PILL ,i DIDN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT WITH THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND I DIDN'T FEEL ANY BETTER WITH THEM"
1,Horrid. Made me GAIN weight.,"I went by the reviews on this site and others about Thyromine, and decided to try it. Wowww, mistake. I gained five pounds in two weeks of taking this stuff, had zero energy, felt incredibly fatigued all the time. It was a nightmare. I will never, ever touch this product again, nor any other by this company. Try at your own risk."
1,Failed for me also.,I took this for 1 month solid and I was hoping for some results and was very disappointed that I felt abosolutely no difference after taking this product. I did not try for a refund. It sounds like it worked for some people; maybe for you too. Just not for me.
1,not much difference with thyromine,"I've been taking this for a month now and to be honest, I can't tell a bit of difference. I was really hoping this was going to help."
1,Didn't work,"I tried this product for a month and got no results. I am glad it worked for some people, but I have been off of it for several days now and can't tell a difference in the way I felt on or off of it. I am still tired all the time, didn't lose any weight. I did get a few headaches, though. I am not for sure that it was due to thyromine, but that is the only thing I was doing different. None since I've stopped taking the supplement."
4,Sharing the Magic,"Mem Fox writes, ""The fire of literacy is created by the emotional sparks between a child, a book, and the person reading."" This quote reconfirms the power of literacy both in homes and at school. This inspiring book will convince you, if you haven't been convinced already, of the amazing experiences children will receive when exposed to being read to at an early age. Fox discusses the need for children to establish ""book language."" This language comes from adventures and exploration of books. The book shares idea of playing games, having a joyful attitude, and being entertained by books, which is an important thing for educators, parents, or any person involved in a child's life to put into practice-something we can all do! I recommend this book to anyone interested in how to support children with early literacy skills in an exciting and non-threatening way!"
2,A very irritating book,"I read aloud to my kids all the time. I probably spend 30-60 mins a day on average doing so. I agree that reading aloud to kids is very important. I still cannot recommend this book to anyone. I find it difficult to accept the opinions of someone who bases most of her theory on having taught her ONE child to read. Yes, that's correct, she only had one child and this child learnt to read almost by osmosis. She must have been very lucky and had an awful lot of time on her hands. If you want to read a whole book on how reading enormous amounts to children will seemingly teach them to read without phonics then this is the book for you, and you probably believed it anyway. If you want some practical advice backed up by evidence then I suggest Jim Trelease's book ""The Read Aloud Handbook"". I gave this book 2 stars, because I also think that reading aloud to children is fantastic and has many benefits."
2,Although I think reading aloud is wonderful,"I think this author got a little carried away. I found some of her examples to be down right insulting. She read aloud to a boy for 15 minutes...and suddently he started reading. Please.I am currently the mother of a boy in Kindergarten and a preschool girl. I have read to my son since he was 2 days old. Through hours of colic, I recited Dr. Seuss to calm us both. In his 5.5 years, I have barely missed a day reading. Although he loves to be read to, he is really struggling to learn to read on his own. And to imply, that if a parent had just read the right books, with the right tones...then it would be a piece of cake is setting up a lot of parents (myself included) for a lot of frustrationg.Learning to read for most kids is hard. I read the entire book looking for some aknowledgement of this fact and there is none.I love reading aloud to my kids, to their classes, to anyone who will listen but this book just goes too far."
4,Good stroller for the price,"I got this stroller for my 21 month old daughter for christmas.She just loves to push her baby doll in it and has to take her baby with her where ever she goes. It does look a little flimsey, but I thought we would try it and to my surprise it is holding up pretty well. She has evern tried to sit in and it is has not broken, only the seat has come undone. That is a easy problem to fix. It is a great for a first stroller for a smaller child."
4,interesting look at the life of Francis Bacon the artist,I purchased this on vhs back in the 80's and it was around $60 at the time and I still have it. I wanted a version to play on my dvd or blu-ray players. The transfer is not much of an improvement over the vhs but considering the source material this is understandable. Not much extras either. A good dvd to also own with this is Love is The Devil.
5,Really Jazz From Germany ??,"Yes, it's true. This explicit CD is from the german artist Till Bronner and it's a pearl. Really. You can listen to the album if it's summer or winter. It doesn't cares because this album is a ground solid work and the track four ""blue eyed soul"" is the perfect combination of Jazz and HipHop... please remember: many co-operations of HipHop musicans and Jazz artists are not so nice because often one part was stronger then the other but here Till Bronner and a japanense HipHop-DJ found the perfect ""together"". This album is a ""must""! And also it's a very good view on the european and specially the german Jazz Scene. Lay back and listen..."
5,Sketch and Scribe,My 6 year old son loves this book. I photocopy the pages and let him go. I homeschool and we use this book as filler while I am setting up for other lessons. I am always amazed at the creative pictures he comes up with. (What happens to our imaginations as we grow older). He asks for more pages every time.
4,Elizabeth Hurley as a schoolgirl......,"with a funky complexion, thick eyebrows, & thicker ankles! This your usual Inspector Morse mystery. He's grumpy, and always ready to have a good pint of Real Ale, and ready to have his sergeant pay for that pint. The real surprise here was seeing Hurley. She probably doesn't want this seen, but hey, a cygnet becomes a swan, right?"
5,Best Arabic Language Intro Book Ever,"Lessons are very clear and concise. Plenty of examples & exercises. I have been looking for an arabic learning course book for quite some time, and non thus far excel Mr Cowan's book in clearity & exciting... Learning through the lessons, I feel more and more at ease with the Arabic language and flame my interest to learn more. No stress in learning...But the book need to be revised as it was published in 1958... sooo long ago.In my opinion, it is the BEST book on introduction to learning the arabic language that I have come acrossed...Highly recommended..."
3,interesting information and worth the investment,"Length:: 0:56 MinsObservation training is very important and within a classroom environment it is even more important. With the recent violence within our schools and the fact that bullying has become commonplace, the need for teachers and administrators to observe student behavior has never been so critical. This book is good but leaves me with some questions. I do recommend it as worth your time and investment."
1,"Unbelievably bad!!! International film can't be this pathetic, can it?","These six shorts from around the world are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. I was disappointed. Much of the disk is no better than what I would expect from immature adolescents with movie-making tools, but some of it actually is depraved, is shallow, or celebrates pure ethnic ugliness (inside and out). I hope this doesn't sound jingoistic but it made me proud to be an American (none of the shorts are American). Are other countries' film industries that primitive? Avoid it if you can."
5,Great '60's TV music!,"Is it just me, or was the music, both theme and incidental, best on the '60's TV series? I think so... just listen to the CDs out there that contain original episodic music from shows such as (the original) Star Trek, or Mission Impossible, or Batman or, well, this one. If you enjoyed those shows and are a fan of good music, this CD is well worth your time and $$!"
2,Less than I expected,I was looking for pieces of information about how to build a CNC Machine. Definitely this book is not this case.
3,Good for the right audience,"So what is the audience? Primarily gay men who get off of stories of force and humiliation focused on male feet and shoes. This isn't a well written collection of short storie but more a collection of porn published and written by members of a a foot fetish organization. None of the pieces are horribly written, except the first one, but there is no real depth to the characters and plots because the point is to turn you on and help you get off quickly. So if feet, raunch, boots, and men turn you on, so might this."
5,Organizing Your Craft Space,"This is a good book for organizing several different types of crafts. It includes Scrapbooking, Quilting, Beading and other crafts. The book helps you recognize alternative sources for organizing besides the organizing products on the market."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I bought the books in hopes it would help me figure out better ways to organize all my craft hobbies - stamping, scrapbooking, painting, etc. The book wasn't helpful at all. Has a few good pictures but didn't really explain some of the things used. Wish author went into more detail."
3,Good book but.......,"This is a good book with beautiful pictures of craft spaces. I ordered in the hopes of getting ideas & inspiration for my craft space, but got none."
2,Pretty Pictures - No Real Information,"I was terribly disappointed with a book with such a beautiful cover, but the pretty pictures continued inside with no real organizing information."
5,Poetic novel/poignant life-story/struggle agst injustice,Story of a Guatemalan Q'anjob'al Maya living in Guatemala's highlands. This book not only tells of the Mayas' history of oppression and injustice but also gives an inspiring example of community organizing and self-determination. Very poetic writing style uses elements of Mayan literary forms. Includes rich cultural detail and beautiful descriptions of emotions and nature.
3,This book provided great cultural insight into Mayan life.,"This book provided great insight into the life of the Mayans, though some parts were somewhat anachronistic, it seemed. The information was good, and the intended statement of the author seems to be clearly made."
4,Great for Homeschoolers,"This book was our 3rd grader's homeschool reading assignment. He is a reluctant reader, so it took him a while to finish it. The vocabulary is slightly difficult for a 9 or 10 year old, but daily discussions about what your student has read helps keep the story interesting and motivates them to read further. HOMESCHOOLERS: READ MY OTHER REVIEWS!"
4,So so!!!,"I bought this CD, it took more days than the days that Amazon offers, the picture on the cover is awesome, original and cool...Track 1 - danceable, sticky, album versionTrack 2 - nice, to listen during trafficTrack 3 - bad mix, not danceable, boring, repetative, so so...!In general, if you r a Shakira fan buy it, and if not, just buy the normal album, the single is not worth it..."
3,Love Shakira,but wiht only 2 songs - whic of course is NOT made clear when you purchase - there is not much to review.
5,"Love this movie, non stop action until the end","This is a must see Horror flick, it keeps you twisting in your seat, see it or you will be missing a great movie."
4,Nice watch but with one flaw,I purchased this watch for my wife. It is a very pretty watch and seems well-made like Seikos typically are. The band has a spring-loaded latch which operates well. The date is extremely hard to read and I have 20/20 vision. A magnifier on the crystal would have been appropriate. The date is the only problem I really have with the watch. I do like the blue face.
5,This is Great!,"This is a great DVD set worth every cent.Kelly McCann/Jim Grover is not just the ""real deal"" as is often said, but a smart, well spoken and skilled instructor/teacher.I purchased this set along with ""Ultimate Krav Maga."" I watched this first, and in doing so I think it made the ""UKM"" set look even worse than it is.As a result of this DVD series I will be buying more of the McCann/Grover series.This is a VERY GOOD training aid."
3,Not really what I had hoped for.,"Fast shipment. Well packaged. I bought this based on the ""Building Your Library"" article in Shooting Times magazine. Nothing wrong with it. The material is practical and very well presented. But I'm a smaller and older guy - most of the techniques would not really work for me."
1,Duke is short-changing us,"The image quality seems OK (2002 was the best), the commentary is very good (Toby Moody and Julian Ryder), but there's very little racing!!!In 2003, Rossi won his third championship on a Honda. At the end of the season, he announced a switch to Yamaha for 2004. Few were expecting him to win from the outset, and expectations for the first race were enormous ... and we get 4 minutes of race coverage! Not just for this race, but pretty much the rest of the season, we get less than 5 minutes per race.On the 2001 DVD, each race was given 8 or 9 or even 13 minutes. The trend has grown worse each year, and the 2004 review hit a real low. It's pathetic that the VHS tapes from the 1990s contain almost twice as much racing as the DVDs of the 2000s.MotoGP fans should boycott Duke until this craziness stops."
2,Huge disappointment,"Following the wait for this to come out as well as Rossi's landmark season, this DVD was a huge let down. Barely any qualifying footage, no post-race interviews and some races seemed to be over almost as soon as they started. Previous seasons were much better produced and I hope this is a temporary blip....."
1,Everyone is right,"I couldn't have said it any better. Half the fun is the post race interviews, but we are getting short-changed with wam-bam-thank you ma'am race footage. I will start the Duke Video boycott."
5,A Tree Is A Plant,I like this book because it was like i would recommend this bookbecause it was very good
3,A Tree is a plantI,I Like this book because I leaned that apple trees look different in allseasons this was confusing because it talked about lots of thing i woudrecommend this book to a freind because it is good
2,A Tree Is a Plant,"I like this book because it is nonfiction , would recommend this book because it tells about trees,My favorite part of the book is when it tells us about the roots."
4,A Tree Is A Plant,I would recommend this book because it has a lot of imformation about trees. I think the tree they zoom in on is the apple tree. Read it and you will find a lot more imformation.
4,A Tree Is A Plant,I like this book because I like apples. My favorite part of the book is when the apples bloom. This book is not confusing because it had easywords. I woud recommend this book to a friend because its a realy greatbook.
1,Amazon 2 day shipping: yeah right,So I ordered this for my formal observation in student teaching. I ordered it on a Tuesday.... paid an extra 13 dollars for 2 days shipping and my book got there a week later.... a day after my formal observation. If you are going to advertise that it will be there within 2 days unless the weekend interferes maybe you should get the book to someone within 2 days.... I feel amazon owes my my shipping fees back.
5,A Tree is a Plant,I would recommend this book because I think it would teach kids something new and they could enjoy the good illistrations.I like this book because it tells the life of the tree in the most perfect way.
3,Love these jeans!,"I do love these Levi's - unfortunately I got them a size too small, so I've been trying to lose weight to fit into them. Not sure I can pull it off. I wonder if I can exchange them for the larger size?"
2,Feeds the masses,"This book should be in the photography section. A lot of the tattoos in this book weren't even that great and there was little substance and little information. I don't even know quite why they would take pictures of a couple of the tattoos I saw in there, let alone make a book with them, ( a few of them, that is ). The photography was very nicely done however. It would be a nice coffee table book that would entertain visitors. But for anyone who knows about tattoos and tattooing this book pretty much ...."
2,NOT WORTH A SECOND LOOK.,"When I spend $40 on a book, I should be compelled to pick it up more than once. Unfortunately that was not the case with this book. The photos were taken of average to below average subject matter, you can see more interesting tattoos in a $5 tattoo magazine."
2,You're better off with a tattoo magazine.,"This coffee table book is more suited to photography enthusiasts than tattoo enthusiasts. There are very few pictures of work that is worthy of a picture book. There's even less information than outstanding artwork. For $..., you'd be much better off getting a couple subscriptions to magazines, such as Skin & Ink and International Tattoo Art."
3,Not sure what to make of this book,"Well, there was some good pictures, but a lot of useless ones as well. Also, the was a few blank pages mixed in throughout. A decent book, for a cheaper price"

3,"All I can say is ""Wow.""","What a performance! Roy Orbison plays a Confederate spy on a secret mission with his very special guitar. Is it just me or does he look even worse without glasses? Anyway, look close to find Sam the Sham of Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs. I think this might be his only film!"
3,Had the CD for yonks and now finally have the DVD,"Years ago I came across a CD in a store. It was a soundtrack sung by Roy Orbison for a movie he starred in. Years later I finally got the DVD and saw the movie. Sure, Roy's acting fell far short of his great singing, but the story was refreshing for its time. The story was set in the final days of the American Civil War with Roy playing a womanising Confederate spy with a heart.My only disappointment is that not all of the soundtrack songs were included in the movie. But, hey, I now have both."
2,Roy Orbison's big mistake,"The mistake isn't this film, but the decision that led to it.In early 1965, Roy Orbison left Monument Records - where he had his biggest success - for MGM Records, partly so he could try his hand at movies. His recording career promptly skidded downhill (at least in the US), and this silly Western comedy was the only film he completed; he's adequate enough, but when he's not singing he seems bland and colorless. Still, if you're a big Roy Orbison fan, or a fan of this kind of movie, this tape is for you."
3,Great gift for a fan,"I purchased this for my husband who loves Roy Orbison. He searched high and low for the sound track for this movie and I ordered the movie on dvd as a surprise for him. Surprised he was and he immediately put it on the player to watch. Although I saw the movie in the late 60's, I cannot say I enjoyed it. Mr. Orbison was a singer and writer beyond compare and I wish he had been given a better role than this. But if you are a fan, get it. No one could sing like him and his song writing always touches the heart. I do think given better roles he could have become a decent actor too but who is to say? But if you are a fan, and love Roy, the dvd is for you!"
5,"Fair movie, Awesome Soundtrack","The only Western war comedy musical I can remember,the story line is weak, but the sound track is classicRoy Orbison. A must for the true Orbison Fan. I'm totallythrilled it's out in DVD."
3,We Forgive You Roy!!!,If there was a Hall of Fame for good guys in Rock 'N' Roll Roy Orbison would be in the first class. That doesn't excuse his involvement in this fair-to-middling programmer. Roy's thespian skills that are on display here run the gamut from A to...A. It doesn't really matter because the filmmakers manage to successfully camoflauge Roy's lack of acting ability. The story isn't much concerning a pair of Confederate spies(Orbison and Sammy Jackson) attempting to heist gold from the San Francisco Mint in the waning days of the Civil War. Selling point is Roy's singing. Note that I didn't say songs because they are rather pedestrian but Roy's heavenly pipes elevate them beyond the mundane. I would recommend this film to Orbison fans and to others describe it as a rather innocuous affair.
3,too big,I should have paid better attention to the size of this book. It has rather large pages which makes it difficult for a young toddler to hold. The book is well done and the pictures are clear but I think I may have enjoyed looking at if more than my daughter.
1,Worst Episode,"Convoluted plot, over-acting, poor sound, terrible cinematography, unbelievable love-interest for Morse. Despite being a huge fan of the series, I won't ever watch this one again."
3,"Mindless, but entertaining","This is book #2 in the ""Sookie"" stories, which I think are sometimes seen as romance, but could also fit the mystery genre. I've read book 1 and liked it and now this one. This is not literature, but for mindless entertainment, it is good (hence, 3 stars). It's written from Sookie's point of view--some people do not like that style, particularly since Harris has a habit to providing unnecessary detail (e.g., ""I brushed my teeth."" or details about Sookie styling her hair. We really do not care.) If you are even a moderately slow reader, it won't take you long to finish. A good weekend or vacation read or maybe something to pick up at the airport. But if you are looking for well-written material, this isn't it. I, however, am looking forward to the rest of the series, as I love the interaction between Sookie & Bill and am very curious to see what happens between her and Eric!"
1,Uggh - Can I Give Negative Stars?,"Can I give negative stars to this book? Seriously. It was so, so bad. I actually enjoyed Book 1, but this was just too much. Won't be finishing any more of this series (especially if they continue on in this vein). No plot, except sex, weird religions and junk fiction. I thought it was just plain stupid. Not recommended."
3,"It's not bad, but not as good as the first","Although the author shows the same talent for originality that she displayed in the first book in the series, the magic that infused that one is missing here somehow. It's competently written, but felt uninspired."
3,"Good, but not as good as the first two books","Charlaine Harris has a delightful off the cuff writing style that's easy to read. Sookie Stackhouse, the main character is a kookie mind reading bar waitress who's boyfriend is a vampire. They go on lots of adventures together. This book was good, but not as good as the first two of the series. You don't hear her voice in this book until the end when a Bill makes a discovery about his family. Oh, and there's a funny scene with the head vamp, Eric, where Sookie removes a bullet from his body with her teeth--it's quite funny. If you read the other two, this one's worth a look too. I wouldn't read it first though."
5,Awesome series.,I love the Sookie Stackhouse stories and will be sad to see it end. Thanks to Mrs. Harris for some excellent characters I will never forget.
2,Don't touch this,"If you expect to get from this book what you got from the TrueBlood series, you are up for a big disappointment. I am lacking words to describe how bad the book was. There was no depth, no anticipation, when reading this book I felt as if I was watching some horrible soap opera. Sookie: kept on arguing with Bill, breaking up with him and getting back together; every 5 pages she had the best sex of her life, every 4 pages she got beaten up and mentioned how strong she was, I guess to justify more beating; got aroused by at least 4 characters.After reading this book, somehow, I feel that I wont enjoy the show that much anymore."
2,no so much,"this book was not good compaired to the first book & esp the 4th.. it was boring but i did like her going to dallas, it didn't keep me on my toes like the first book but i kept reading bacause i am a HUGE fan of true blood i wanted to see what was going to happen"
5,Excellent,I LOVE the Sookie Stackhouse novels and this one was no exception! I can't put any of the books down!
3,Just another Sookie saga,"Still the same..... different location. I read the Sookie Stackhouse books because they are a little entertaining, short and quick read."
4,Not As Good As The First,"I just completed the second book of this series. It wasn't nearly as good as the first book, but it was still entertaining. The mystery aspect of this novel is just as good. I got sucked into the book as soon as she met the vampires in Dallas. The whole aspect of the Fellowship of The Sun is very interesting.The novel started to bother me when it began to dive into the taboo.. what in the world is a Maenad? The fact that the novel starts to address such areas as homosexuality, group sex parties, etc. really was perhaps on the extreme side. Charlaine may have gone a bit too far on this one. Hopefully the Taboo and orgies get tuned down in the next books because it distracts from the story and Sookie's character."
5,Nicole Eglinger's Reviews,"Another awesome book for Charlaine Harris. A must read. If you loved True Blood you will love these books much better and Thanks to Alan Ball for making this into a HBO Seris. Well written and very imaginive.Nicole EglingerDavie,Florida"
4,Country goes to town,"The best thing about this book, and the previous book 'Dead Until Dark' is the interesting twist about vampires living in a small town. The writing is refreshingly new and not at all tedious. Sookie Stackhouse and her vampire lover, Bill, go to Dallas to find a missing vampire. Harris does a great job of explaining Sookie's first plane flight, and first trip to the big city. Sookie also has a mystery/murder to solve in her small hometown. It's great to see a mystery in a small town where everyone knows each other, but none of the residents have a clue about what's really going on. I hope Ms. Harris has a new Sookie Stackhouse novel ready very soon."
3,More enjoyable than the first -- 3.8 stars,"Although I liked the first book, something about this one was smoother. I'm still not fond of first person, but it worked better here. The twists & turns of the plot heightened the suspense, although there were some too coincidental or too predictable moments. This one provided a number of interesting insights into Bill & his relationship with Sookie -- things that nicely set up future conflicts. Nicely done; fewer annoying and unimportant minor details to wade through, more action. Eric becomes ever more intriguing as well."
3,it is just ok,I thought I might like it but it just couldn't hold my interest for the entire lenght of the book
4,Living dead in Dallas. A Sookie Stackhouse novel.,It reads well. T was very interesting to read the book after watching the hbo series. The difference in the story is great. Very good.
4,Fun book!,"I've enjoyed all the Sookie Stackhouse books, this one is no different, humorous and sexy, these novels are all fun to read."
5,Good but different,I would recommend this before watching the series. Its quite different than the show but very good in its own way
3,Good not great.,"While the story line is addicting, the writing is questionable- author is repetitive and occasionally contradicts herself even on the same page. Despite these flaws, of the 8 books in this series, I would rank this book as among the better half. A better editor and the elimination of the background information/recap that she gives about certain characters every book (she needs to either assume the reader knows all the characters already or doesn't know any) would make the series stronger."
3,OK but not great,"Some very interesting ideas - but over all a ""romance novel"" book for women :) A great deal of detail about what the vampire does to please Sookie - very little about Sookie doing anything for him... Not a great read as a mystery - but romance novel lovers will like it."
4,Loved it!!,"Love all these books!! Very entertaining, fun, and easy reads. You got to have books like this in your collection where you can forget reality for a bit and dive into a world where fantasy is reality."
5,Living Dead in Dallas,"Great idea a human not so human dating a vampire whom she fights with a lot, is not whom I would have suspected to be the heroine but that's who she is, ohhh I forgot to mention that she says shes disabled but yeah she not she a telepath and a really good at that, she was loaned out(like a tool) the the Vampires in Dallas to see if she could find a missing vampire which she does, but at what cost to her, boy she sure takes a beating from the fellowship which is where the missing vampire. Poor Sookie when she get be she still needs to find out who really killed Lafayette and it's not just a who it's more than one who was involved in it. But the Maenad take a interest in it."
3,Better than first book,"Much better than the first book in the series, but still not kind of the book which would captured me and keep me thinking about characters.After disappointment I experienced with first book, I decided to give the series second chance and find out what would happen with main characters. Even though the beginning of the book was very boring, it run up to exciting reading afterwards.It was strictly a leisure reading. No need to think about it, just enjoying reading itself. Reading this book is excellent way to relax after really hard day in job or when studying for exams."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still a fun read","I agree with some of the previous reviewers ~ I don't think this one was nearly as good as the first, but it's still pretty darn good. It had me staying up later than I needed to just so I could read a little bit more. And when I was finished, I couldn't download #3 fast enough. I'm a big fan of the series, and if you've read the first book, you should definitely read this one."
4,Living Dead in Dallas,A great read. Charlaine Harris has done it again. I just love these southern vampire mysteries.
4,I'm in love with Sookie,"I liked the first Sookie Stackhouse book but I didn't love it. After Twilight I craved some vampire romance and ""Dead until Dark"" didn't deliver all that I hoped for. When it came to romance, neither did ""Living dead in Dallas"" but it was so thrilling. I really couldn't put it down.IMO, a good book is when the characters becomes alive and you feel for them. Sookie is such a great character and I'm in love with her. She is witty, brave and lovable. Bill however, he just comes across as boring. I get nothing out of him. I hope that will change in the next books, cause I can't stop reading about Sookie and her adventures."
5,Great books!,"Excellent books! They're a bit of a fast read, so once you're done, you'll be sad, but they're good enough to read again and again while waiting for the next book!"
2,No improvement from first book,"I was hoping that the second book in this series was an improvement, but for me it wasn't. Too repetitious and trite. I won't read more, just not enough to keep me interested."
2,Alternate reading,"It was interesting to read so many different takes on this book. Perhaps some of you would be willing to look at some of my realistic futuristic thriller novels such as Pluto 2550 or Adam 2552. Maybe you would love a modern political, men's adventure, romance, thriller unlike no other, which is my top selling novel, The Immortal. If you dare to see a close look at the paranormal or supernatural thrillers, you might enjoy Cast out of Paradise or Kevin and the Dead. An adventure in excitement waits for you. Incidentally, I am the author, Daniel Whittman. All of these novels and more are on amazon.com. [...]"
2,So-so,"Better than the first, but still nothing exceptional. At best, Harris seems to be a developing author in this book. At worst, she's just bad"
4,Better than the first!,"Really starting to love the characters in this series--Charlaine Harris has created an interesting world in the small town of Bon Temps--especially Sookie, Eric and Sam. I love all the trouble she gets into and her ninja readiness to take on whatever comes her way."
4,It's almost like 2 books in one,"In the second book of The Southern Vampire series, Sookie is summoned to Dallas to help locate a missing vampire. There she must investigate a vampire hating organization, The Fellowship of the Sun. Meanwhile, back in Sookie's hometown, one of her co-workers has been murdered and a cop has been framed.This actually feels like two books in one even though it's not a long book. The story in the beginning and the end of the book is almost completely separate from the middle. This doesn't really hurt the enjoyment of the book though. I found this book to be less enjoyable then the first because Sookie gets the stuffing beat out of her all the time. It gets annoying after a while. The best thing about this book are the bits of Bill's past and Eric's expanded role. All in all there's more action and less romance. Not quite as enjoyable as the first but still a great read."
3,Living Dead In Dallas.,"Living Dead in Dallas is part 2 of the Sookie Stackhouse series. Book 2 was about Sookie being sent to Dallas by Eric to assist the vampires in Dallas with locating a missing vampire who is apart of their nest. Sookie encounters dangers while in Dallas looking for the vampire. When Sookie returns home from Dallas, she soon finds a new adventure....finding out who killed the cook from Merlott's Bar. I didn't find the second novel as interesting as the first one; however, it was okay. I will continue to read the series since I have started it."
3,Good book... but annoyed,"The book is great... if you read the first Sookie Stackhouse then you know what to expect, but the most irritating part was better than halfway through my book there are 33 pages missing... yes missing! From page 199 thru 230 is gone. So I'm super annoyed at that fact, but Amazon shipped only 1 day late and the book is very interesting and keeps great pace."
3,"Good fast read, not nearly as good as #1.","So I just finished ""Living Dead in Dallas"" the 2nd in the Sookie Stackhouse series. I really liked the last 2 chapters because it felt really good to finish this book, simply because I wanted it to be over. About 3 or 4 chapters in I was lost as to what was happening, the story wasn't as easy to follow as #1. But there were a few pretty scary moments in this one, which gives me hope for the rest of the series. I still don't know what genre to put these novels in. It is definitely a fantasy/horror/paranormal/romance/comedy. Yeah, that sums it up. Now on to #3. (I really hope she eventually dumps Bill. I don't really like that guy...)"
4,Enjoyable,"An easy, enjoyable read. I would definitely read more in this series, although I wouldn't buy the books I'd be happy to borrow from the library. Light and fun, great for the beach."
4,Could Be Better,"Part of me really wants to like these novels. They are a refreshing mix of mystery and horror in the vein of the Anita Blake novels (back before Anita became obsessed with nothing but sex, sex, sex). I'm really drawn to the two main characters, Sookie and Bill. In Sookie we have a great heroine who is reluctant to be a heroine. In Bill we have an interesting vampire with a history that dates back to the Civil War. With this novel we finally get to learn a little more about Bill's family -- his human family -- and what happened to their descendants. What really irks me about these novels is the writing. At times it is very immature and annoying. Be that as it may, I've really enjoyed these novels and their Southern setting. If you're looking for a new take on the vampire/mystery genre, check out these novels."
4,Neck-Biting!,"After reading Dead Until dark, I honestly expected this book to be a bit better. I enjoyed it until the end, which confused me slightly. But while Sookie, Bill, and even the unpredictable Eric were in Dallas helping the local vampire nest, I found myself biting my bottom lip with anticipation to what would happen next. This book was interesting and full of mystery. I hope to be just as enthralled with the next installment in the Southern Vampire Mysteries."
4,Living Dead in Dallas,"In this second Sookie Stackhouse novel, we re-join Sookie and Bill right as one of Sookie's coworkers is brutally murdered. Before she even has time to investigate this, she is attacked by a beast and then summoned to use her telepathic powers to help the Dallas vampire nest....as if she doesn't have enough of her own problems!After Dead Until Dark, I wasn't sure what all the hype was about these books..sure it was entertaining, but not the best ever. The stories are short, Sookie is a bit annoying, and the southern charm can be a bit too thick, but after this one, I'm a convert! I loved it, the plot kept me up reading late and I felt I got to know Sookie a bit more and found myself relating to her more. My only complaint is that the books are still very short but quite pricey so I will probably continue getting from the library. Looking forward to Club Dead though!"
4,True Blood: Book Two!!!,"After reading the first book, I dived right in to the next book. It was a good and interesting read, but not as great as the original. I can't help but compare it to the series. The Maenad is hardly mentioned, the ending is different, Lafayette is dead in the first chapter, and a lot more. Months after Rene tried to kill her, Sookie is rushed off to Dallas with her Vampire boyfriend, Bill to help a fellow vampire find his brother, Farrell, who has been missing for days. Throughout the book, Sookie must deal with the Fellowship of the Sun Church, Godfrey, Callisto the Maenad and much more. If you love the True Blood series, you'll love LIVING DEAD IN DALLAS!!!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Bloodless boyfriend intrigue.The limitations of a small town (how many people can you kill and have one left?) means some city adventuring is in store here, due to the undead connections of her shag, and her own unique abilities.Somewhat risky when they are superstrong and can rip you to pieces, too.Basically the same quality as the first though, with the same sort of bad cover."
5,Gotta Love It,"These books are getting better and better. Just when you think nothing else is gonna happen to poor Sookie the book rocks your world, that girl is lucky she isn't dead by this point. I think its a good assumption that its because shes hangin with Vamps but hey love is blind right.. I love this series and will be watching True Blood trust me on that LOL... I have an new addiction and her name is SOOKIE STACKHOUSE!!"
3,"weak, but fun.","The second novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series is certainly much weaker than the first, lacking a solid and substantial plot, but instead containing one that meanders and fragments. Though the introduction of the Fellowship and the maenad (as a counterpoint) are refreshing, there are done in a flat and haphazard manner. Though Eric and Bill's complexity (straddling the world of vampire and human) grows, the other characters remain flat and drab. While the book is strong, in comparison to the second season of True Blood (which is based on this book) it is sadly lacking in drama, dynamic, style, complexity, plot, and character. The actors, writers, directors, composer, cinematographer somehow take a (granted, fun) trash novel and turn it into pure, engaging, magical joy. Harris' books are fun and help tide one over between seasons, and she deserves credit for her creation, but I hope no one is judging the show based on the books. Grade: C"
4,Reading with Tequila,"I'm a big fan of True Blood and I just can't help comparing Living Dead in Dallas to season 2 of the show. While I enjoyed the book, it was so very different from the show. Normally that would be okay, but the show was more entertaining than this particular book. I really wish I had read the book before the show began so that I wouldn't have had it in the back of my mind while reading."
4,Getting a bit better...,"The second book in the Sookie Stackhouse series is more exciting and adventurous than the first. The appearance of the maenad was interesting and not at all like the one depicted in the TV series with some minor exceptions. As usual, Sookie is spunky, hot-tempered, and a pretty average young woman with unusual gifts. I like her more now than I did in the first book when she seemed more needy and dependent."
2,Horrible....,"This book was so boring.... What happened??? I mean The first book was soo great! it had everything, mystery, romance and vampires. Here in the 2nd book, she introduces to werewolves. The plot of the book is so different from the series, so it does have some surprises."
5,My favorite so far!,"I loved this book! i think it was such an improvement from the first book. Sookie and Bill are great together, and I love seeing them interact. The love is so strong between them at times. Eric just needs to go away! This book had the perfect plot, great resolution and climax. I would recommend this to everyone!"
3,Quick fun read!,"This is one of the few things where I actually prefer the TV show over the book, but it's still a fun quick read that is great for summer reading."
5,"Light, funny, fast-paced, and entertaining","This second book in the series is even better than the first one ('Dead Until Dark'). And the first one was fantastic!The style this is written in is very different from any other books I've read. It's a mystery mixed with humor mixed with horror with a little bit of romance thrown in.The characters really come to life - even the dead ones. I love the main character, Sookie, and her boyfriend, Bill, but was also glad to see more of Eric, that rascal Viking vampire with the awesome physique and complete lack of morals.Buy this book - you'll be glad you did!"
5,"Good book, good seller","Thanks for the book. Trying to read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books, some from the library, others I am buying, and appreciated your quality and quick service."
5,A great mystery..amazingly fathomable though about Vampires :),"I own all the ""Sookie Stackhouse"" (""Trueblood"") books that have been published along with season one of the ""Trueblood"" HBO series that is based on the books. I'm a fan of these and I never expected to be so!!! I only read the books to keep abreast of what my granddaughter and daughter were reading..and got ""hooked""...I'm anxiously awaiting the next book and season two of the HBO, TV series also. Highly recommended if you love a mystery. :)"
4,Very Entertaining,"Much improved second book in the Stackhouse series. Fast paced with dark humor. Very entertaining brain junk food.Sookie has improved on her telepathy and is now a more valuable asset to the vampire community. With her new professional look, Sookie and her vampire Bill head to Texas to investigate a missing vamp. Slashed up by a new supernatural being, captured by a religious anti-vamp cult, badly beaten, ramed into by a truck, shot at by machine guns...etc this girl appears to have an unstoppable will. And a nieve attitude that can make you laugh!The best of the book is when Sookie returns from Dallas and she's faced with asking help from the vampire Eric whom is relentless in his efforts in is affections with Sookie."
3,Reading all Night in VA,"This is the second in the series and is the basis of the second season ofTrue Blood: The Complete Second Season (HBO Series). Though unlike the second season the book focuses mainly on the part about Dallas and very little on the maenad. I'll probably be in the minority, but I feel that that part could have been left out of the whole book entirely as it didn't add much to it at all.But the parts where Sookie is in Dallas are very good. I liked reading that part better than watching the show because I couldn't get into that part at all.I felt like I got to know Sookie, Bill and Eric a bit more than in the first book. I'll also say Harris had me laughing plenty of times in the book with her sharp wit, just like she did in the first."
1,Really tried to like it,"Fan of L.K. Hamilton but even as prolific as she is, I kept wanting something in the same genre to bide the time between her books...Happened to catch Sookie on HBO and waited throughout the entire season for something to spark. Never really was a fan of AP and hated the fake southern accent of most of the cast. Kudo's to Layfaette, Tara and Eric actors for making this watchable.Thought surely the directors had messed up yet another good author's work but after reading three books, it still has not managed to create any spark of interest. Perhaps it's because I can't get Anna's inane voice out of my mind? A disappointed fan of the genre.Recommendations: Laurell K Hamilton, Marjorie Liu, Christine Feehan, Kelley Armstrong, Patricia Briggs, Katie McAlister"
2,Living Dead in Dallas,"I have not read this book yet, but was surprised it was such a small paperback. I hope to like this book: ""Living Dead in Dallas"" so I cannot give it a fair rating."
4,Timely,"Due to the exceptional bad weather it was late but JUST the bad weather, perfect condition present was greatly loved."
2,jumped on the vampire bandwagon,"not so good- easy boring story. bought two of her books at the same time and have not purchased any more. Pretty much jumped on ""vampires"" being popular and used that to sell some cheap books."
3,"Great character development, average story","Good, but not as good as first one. Characters are still awesome, and they're developed just fine in this one. But the main story, if I'm sure which is the ""main"" story, is a little lame, as are the side story or two. Kind of a ""bridge"" book to take us from the first great one to something hopefully better after this one."
3,Slow But Few Great Parts,I found this book to be very slow up until the very end - Just push through and get to the end and it's great.
5,Just as Exciting as the First,"I couldn't wait to start the second book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, and unlike most sequels/series it was just as good as the first one. I was a little unconvinced about the Greek monster/god, finding that character a little too out there for the book, yet the author was able to tie her into the story in a convincing enough way at the end. I loved how the relationship between Sookie and Bill deepened and how Eric's passion for Sookie becomes obvious to everyone. I will take a little break from the series for a few weeks or so, but I'm looking forward to reading the third novel as it sits teasingly on my shelf."
5,Living Dead in Dallas,Vey very interesting. A great book over all. If you like anything Vamp this is a great book to pick up !
4,Another great vampire story,Love the sookie stackhouse stories. entertaining and a very easy read. i recommend these books to anyone who likes a good vampire story or anyone who likes mystery stories.
2,not great but will pass the time,"Sometimes you just want quick mindless reading and have a series so you can just keep ripping through the books without putting too much thought into what you'll read next. For that reason, I'll keep with this series!"
2,Ok sequel,"Ok sequel to Dead Until Dark, is almost two separate stories. The first and last portion of the book concern a murder in Bon Temps and the problems caused by a Maenad. Sandwiched in between is Sookie and Bill's visit to Dallas in search of a missing vampire, thought to have been kidnapped by the anti-vampire Fellowship of the Sun. I enjoyed the the Dallas story, but didn't find the other story very interesting; the introduction of the maenad as a plot device being pretty pointless. I also find the Eric/Sookie/Bill love triangle to be a little tiresome. The second season of 'True Blood' is much better, with more Jason (who is my favourite character on the show) and a bigger and much more menacing role for the maenad."
3,Book....dj,"This book was my least favorite so far. It's okay, but I like the setting in Louisiana better for some reason."
1,Bad buy,"Piece of junk. It started smoking shortly after plugging it in for charging, Teaches you never buy a cut-rate product. By a real Nikon battery. I gave it one star, because it wouldn't let me give it ""no"" stars."
2,super glue & EN-EL1,"The product, with no brand name, looked like what I used in my camera. After a shoot I went to remove the battery and could not get it to slide out. I ended up super glueing a piece of plastic to the end of the battery so I could pull it out of my camera. By the way camera is a Konica-Minolta A200."
4,All Charged Up,"Didn't know what to expect from a battery that costs .39 cents! You know what they say about ""if something sounds to good to be true"", but it works as good as the original. The shipping was 25 times more than the product, but what can I expect? .39 cent shipping? Good-bye (buy)."
1,"Product came defective, never worked!!!","The battery was defective, left it charging all night nothing!!! Their defect policy dictates that mail them the product at your own expense. For the price I paid for the battery I would pay the same amount to ship, and what is the guarantee I would receive a working battery. Although this is a small camera battery, if they do not have good quality than it must be luck of a draw to get a working product from them."
2,No big Deal,Leila Forouhar is not a great singer. This album is boring and tired!!! I don't recommend it to anyone except persian music fanatics who have to have all persian cds.
1,resistance free riding,I was very disappointed in this book by Richard Shrake. I have read his other articles in the free horse newspaper and they are very good and informative. In this book the only thing you get out of it is that you should breath on your horse. The entire book is about that.
3,Left wanting,"I couldn't wait to get ""Memoirs of Elise"" but was surprised at how small the book was at 5 1/2"" x 7 1/2"" and only 141 pages. It only took me a little over 60 minutes to finish it. I will be the first to say that what I read I loved. BUT, I wanted more substance and was left feeling a little cheated wondering why he didn't go a farther into her life. Just my opinion."
4,Good continued story.,"Gives me a sense of relief knowing Elise really did go on to have a fairly happy life, minus Mr. Collier, though no one else took his place in her heart. She still loved, lived and was a success."
3,Really Cheated,"I bought a signed copy of this book, and agree with the other reviewer. It was short and very shallow. In addition, when I decided to sell my copy, I was told that I can't, due to some kind of infringement on the rights of Richard Matheson. Buyers be careful, it's yours to keep!"
3,Many questions still unanswered,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment in that much of it is spent discussing William Robinson and his brother John. It's a small book, only 110 pages, and you can read it in an hour. Except for the fact that Elise bought a pig farm, there is little additional detailed information about her life."
3,Dancing with Horses: The Art of Body Language,"As an equestrian who seeks to continue to broaden my knowledge of the relationship between horse and human I found the content to be lovely to watch but not enough information was provided. I was anticipating more examples of how Mr Hempfling goes about his training. I do believe Mr Hempfling has something to offer the equine community, but it seems he is keeping a lot of the ""how to's"" to himself. Maybe there is more information in his follow up books and videos, but after viewing the Dancing with Horses video I am cautious about spending more money to find out."
1,Dancing With Horses,I really was disappointed by this book. It promises such great things but that's all it does. I got about 50 pages in and he was still talking about how great the things he was going to tell you are. So I thought hey I'll skip ahead and get to the good stuff...wrong....he nevers does. Or if he does it's about 1 sentence then he goes back to tellin you what he is going to talk about and how great it is.
1,great photos - dissapointing text,"When I look at this book on my shelf I wish I had my money back. I paid a lot more than the Amazon list price for it. The photos are beautiful but the text is sorely lacking. If you are looking for methods, you won't find it here. It only promises what you will find and never do, page after page- right to the end. I already have a wonderful relationship with my horses (at liberty) and I thought that I might learn about someone else's methods and possibly improve my own. It is more mystery and alure, no real how to info ever given. I guess something was lost in the translation."
4,"Great book, but...","This is an awesome book, but I had a hard time applying it. Maybe those with more experience can use it more. I don't think it's for beginners."
4,horse book,"When I first placed the order, I waited 3 weeks for it to arrive. It didn't. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent a new order. It arrived promptly and in the expected condition. I would buy from this seller again."
5,Great course on psychology and motivation,"This is a 7-cassette ""course"" on procrastination and motivation. It is really very good, and covers not only procrastination, but also many aspects of motivation and psychology. It is like a mini psychology course. I listen to it in my car. It is very good. The author's style is friendly and conversational. I highly recommend this."
5,Best Radio I have ever owned,"The Sony XDR-S3HD is the best clock radio/alarm clock I have ever owned. I am able to pick up 15 HD stations (IN the Louisville, KY area) with the included antenna. I am very impressed with the clarity. I also works quite well as an alarm clock. I has a nice design. The remote is a good feature well. The controls are very intuitive and easy to use. I highly recommend this product."
4,Very Nice and HD Radio,"I saw this radio while I was in a high end TV store. I could not believe the beauty of it. The wooden cabinet is really nice to look at and the unit is relatively compact. A big plus is the clock, which is also an alarm clock if you need one.I saw it again at Circuit City as they were closing and I purchased mine there. I wanted to try HD radio to read the song title/artist on the display.The sound is nice. You can crank up the bass a bit for a little more sound if you need it. The modern dance music has so much bass that you may not want to. I cranked up the treble just a little for a clearer sound that projected into the room a little better.I am using a taller style amplified Terk antenna which I purchased at Best Buy. It works for both AM and FM. My reception is good, although the enclosed antennas work fine too.This is not a reciever, as such, with massive sound, but if you need a beautiful, compact, HD radio that can fill a small room, then give the Sony a try."
2,Don't do it!!!,"Even at the price of $100 at the Sony outlet store, I'm returning it tomorrow. First of all, the power block is huge, heavy and emits a slight buzzing sound. Because I purchased it as a clock radio I know this noise would drive me nuts at night. There are many HD stations on the AM and FM band here in the S.F bay area. However, even with the external AM loop antenna attached I was only able to pull in 2-3 and the most powerful, KGO, a talk radio station registered no HD signal at all. Without the antenna, reception was poor at best. Sound quality was ok, but no big deal. Have no idea what Sony was thinking with this product."
3,I paid for new and received a floor model without instructions,"The radio was $25 less than list, plus free shipping. But what I received was a repackaged radio (with a noticeable ding on the top), none of the usual careful Sony packaging inside the box, all the separate parts rewrapped sloppily, AND NO INSTRUCTION BOOK nor any of the usual unpacking warnings and explanations.The radio seems fine and sounds fine. But I can't program it without the instructions. The radio was sold by Amazon but shipped from Target. I will keep it if Amazon, or Target, will furnish the instructions.I've ordered electronics, snow-blowers, vacuum cleaners, radios and TVs from Amazon (as well as a steady stream of books and CDs, new and used.) This is the first time I've ever been disappointed. jimdoyle56"
2,not to good,I bought this hd radio and it worked good at first about a week ago it started to good wild the clock won't stay set i set it and it does good for about a half the day and it has to be set again. The display is a nother thing it does what ever it want to it goes bright and than dark . I would tell people not to buy it not worth it money!!!!!!
1,do not buy this item,"this item is consantly freezing up. It resets itself. I have to continuely unplug the radio. this is a piece of junk. you only see refurbed items, no new items in stock anywhere. because they suck!"
2,poor instructions enclosed,I AM SURPRISED THAT A BIG COMPANY LIKE SONY SUPPLIES SUCH POOR OPERATING AND ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEIR PRODUCT. I HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT HOW ASSEMBLE THE AM ANTENNA.I WONDER IF SONY EVERY TEST THEIR PRODUCTS WITH FIRST TIME AVERAGE CUSTOMERS TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET THE SONY PRODUCT WORKING.
1,Sony XDR-S3HD HD Radio,"Well, ... I bought one of these SONY radios. The sound is really bad. It sounds like it is packed inside a cardboard box. Also, if you use it as an alarm clock, there is no snooze feature. You either get up ... or turn the radio off."
4,good overall,"Pro:1) works well, sounds great (I use an external amp, speakers and antenna)2) internal speakers are ok3) cabinet is ok (looks like wood without grain)Con:1) Has a clock and alarm, but is a few features short of a clock radio (snooze button, gradual volume increase, buzzer if music doesn't work)2) Takes a strong signal to get HD. Roof antenna recommended.3) display is way too bright. Plan on adding some film/gel if you like to sleep in the dark.4) a little bigger than I'd like."
4,excellent radio - good clock radio,"The radio part is excellent. The clock radio part has some problems. First there is no snooze button. Second there is only one preset for alarm time. Initially as set up, when the radio awakened me in the morning, the display did not show the current time. Later I found another display option, so this problem is cleared now. Also the buyer should realize that HD (hybrid digital) radio is not a standard yet, although there seem to be several to many in my local area."
2,two fatal flaws,"This radio works great under the right circumstances, but has two fatal flaws which have caused me to move it from the living room to the garage. The first is that it has no battery back up. Any electical outage or blip will loose all the stored channels, unless you plug it into a UPS meant to power computers.The second flaw is that it has no switch to turn HD on or off. If you listen to a station in a fringe area, the station will continually go between HD and regular. There is a 3 second time difference so this makes those stations unlistenable. Too bad, otherwise this would have been a great radio."
4,Not bad.,"This radio works as advertised. The remote control is a nice feature. The sound quality from the HD AM and FM channels is an obvious improvement over non-HD channels. The tiny speakers do not produce much bass but the quality is adequate for a small radio. Use of an antennae, included, is a must to receive a clear signal.It would be nice if it had a digital out for connection to an external receivers/amplifiers."
4,HD radios-not user friendly,"This is a good-sounding radio but lacks some very important user features. One would be a battery back-up. If the power goes off, you lose all your settings, which could be dozens of things you must set up. Because of this, I bought a UPS (battery back-up) just for my radio. The other thing is the lack of dual alarms. So now, I must use my old wind-up alarm clock, too. Otherwise, I have no complaints. This is the radio I would recommend to a friend buying a HD radio."
2,Difficult to set up,This radio is difficult to use. The directions are less than clear about how to inter presets and access features. Be aware that HD radio is very sensitive to antena placement (the signal is only 500 watts). This radio loses FM about twice an hour and has never played AM at all. Do not buy this product expecting plug and play.
2,Nice sound bad alarm,"The radio sounds great. I bought it to replace my bedside alarm clock but it is not good for that. It has no snooze button, it only has one alarm, not good for two people and you would think for the price of this radio that it would have a battery back up in case of powerage outage. If you don't care about the alarm clock it's fine."
1,Amazon honors return policy,"This radio, here in Folsom, a few miles from Sacramento CA, could pick up only one AM station! That station also has HD, which also was receivable. However, I could not even hear KFBK AM(1530 kHz, 50KW), the station I wanted to hear in HD. Other radios here get many stations, including KFBK. The radio did work fine on FM, but that wasn't what I wanted to receive.I called Amazon, they sent me a return label, UPS picked it up, and Amazon issued a refund to my credit card. As far as I am concerned, the radio is junk. But Amazon did the right thing, efficiently, and without complaint."
5,Great Introduction,"Trefethen's ""Spectral Methods in Matlab"" is the best introduction I've seen to spectral methods and I've recommended it to many students over the years. Trefethen has the uncanny ability to boil complicated ideas down to their essences and present them in a clear, logical progression."
1,I found this book to be a major disappointment.,"I read ""The Wall"" a very long time ago, and recently discovered and read ""White Lotus"" and was absolutely bowled over by both. I was thrilled, after two such wonderful books to find ""Antoinetta"" and anticipated another masterpiece!Unfortunately, I have to admit that a very rare thing happened for me....I couldn't make myself finish this book. I found the characters flat and unbelievable, the plot ridiculous and the whole thing a total bore! I grant you, this may not be a fair hearing (since I only finished about half the book) but since it isn't a very long novel, I didn't think that even if I had read to the end that there were enough pages left for the author to ""redeem"" the first boring half. Perhaps a glass of chardonnay, as another reviewer has suggested would have ""mellowed"" my feelings about this book, but I think not."
4,Good book!,"I thought it was a good book. Infact, Im going to get the next series in the book later today since I just finisihed the first one"
4,"utterly immersive, reality-based sci-fi","Put simply, this is a thouroughly satisfying read for anyone who wonders what mankind's first interplanetary foray might _actually_ look like. Robinson's mastery of technology speculation is showcased on nearly every page, but he does not fall into the trap of sacrificing character development for plot acceleration. The personalities and conflict among the ""First One Hundred"" explorers help draw you in rather than distract you from rendering the stark beauty of a planet you've never seen up close"
1,I agree 100% with eheidel's review!,"What's sad is that I actually DID try to read this book a second time, over a year after the initial attempt stalled after a couple of hundred pages. Once again, I thought it really good for some tens of pages and, once again, I became thoroughly bored with it and had to stop. It's finally time to sell all three books in this series."
4,Epic,"In honor of the Mars Rover Landing I decided to read this book. I think seeing the rover pictures really helped me understand the landscapes and visualize the descriptions from the author.In one word this book was ""Epic"". Long, complex and full of details. The first part of the book captured my attention. I loved hearing about the colonization of Mars and the first 100. I got a bit lost in the middle of the book when it focused on political intrigue and the varying options of how Mars should be settled and what the future should look like. It lost the wonder of the first section. However, the conclusion was fantastic. The planet wide war was fascinating and the final conclusion kept me on the edge of my seat. I want to see the ice dome of the hidden colony."
2,"Pretty boring, stupid characters","I thought this book was pretty boring. I got to page 132 and gave up. They had traveled to Mars, and yet I still felt like nothing had happened. Just because you try to make a story realistic doesn't mean you should make it boring. And why do sci-fi astronauts never have any self control? They always have to have sex on these long space voyages. None of them have any moral standards. I was hoping they would spring an air leak half way through the trip."
1,Red Mars forgets about mars,"Red Mars starts off well, then falls into a complete mess. The main problem with it is that it does not focus enough attention to the red planet. Far too much goes into the characters, whom have no quality in them to make them likeable. It is more of a soap opera that takes place on Mars than a story about colonizing the planet. We are stuck reading about who slept with who than what it was like living on another planet. I was expecting a man vs. mars kind of tale, instead it was more man vs. man. Red Mars should be renamed to The Real World on Mars"
2,"Good science, tired politics","After reading a long string of non-fiction works, I was in the mood for a good science fiction read. I thought Red Mars was it. I was wrong. The science was fascinating but at times highly implausible. The human dynamics at first seemed rich, even if the individual characters did not. However, as this novel sank into the wholly discredited swamp of Marxist ideology, I found myself surprised and ultimately angry that I had wasted so much time. Yet another ""communism's a fine philosophy but nobody's done it right yet"" plea, this time wrapped up in the garb of science fiction. Well, yes -- in fact and in philosophy, it was pure fiction"
1,store bought science,"Not too much happens here, I couldn't finish the book. Also I got the idea that the author didn't have a firm handle on the science & technology but had bits of it patched into the book from other sources. Not very believabl"
2,Too long,"This book was way too long, dry and boring. I really like space books but this isn't exactly great for first-time readers jumping into space novels."
3,Very Technical read,Very Technical read. Not a lot of dialog. Still a good entertaining book though. Would recommend it to my nerdier friends.
3,Fascinating beginning and then drags on and on and on and...,"The first 200 pages swept me away: How the first 100 get to Mars and the beginning of their new life. Later on it's all about politics, terraforming and endless, repetitive description of Mars geography. Some of the ideas (eg Space Elevator) are cool, some out of place (long livety drugs). I won't be reading GREEN MARS after this!"
2,Award winner?,"I found the book extremely slow. I skimmed whole chapters where characters seemed to wander aimlessly describing the landscape. This slowed down the pace of the book and made it unnecessarily long. Robinson is certainly no Muir, I had difficulty picturing the landscapes described. Some of the characters and their interactions are interesting, but just as you get into it, Robinson cuts to describing still more landscapes. Just as you begin to like some of the characters, they get killed off left and right. I'm reading the next book because I already bought it, but if I had read Red Mars first, I wouldn't have bothered."
2,Disappointing,Books becomes incredibly boring midway. Buy this book if you need an safe alternative to sleeping pills.
2,One bonus star for theoretical science...,"I read a lot of science fiction, and typically enjoy books that work in good hardcore science, be it real, theoretical, or fantastical. This book manages to come up with a few of each. There is a great deal devoted to the science of terraforming mars into human habitable environment, and the process of human surviving in the harsh enviroment that exists today. Honestly though, Robinson would have done better writing a non-fiction essay on Mars habitation than this poor effort at a fictional story.The characters and plot lines are blurry and disinteresting. Time takes decades long leaps, with little warning and it became confusing and tedious.I had to force myself to finish it, and there is little danger of my reading the next two books in the series, or anything else from Robinson for that matter."
1,"Juvenile, racist and filled with one dimensional characters.","I would give this book no stars if possible (even negative stars would be better.) You don't have to read more than 20 pages of this junk to identify Red Moon as ""it's-another-politically-correct-piece-of-garbage-agitprop-kind-of-book"" that infests the retail bookshelves with what passes for ""literature"" these days.The author clearly hates whites and arabs, and it would be interesting to know the ethnicity of the author. I think we can guess.Best to spend your hard-earned money on the Classics until the new Dark Age is over."
2,Some enjoyable moments. But not quite worth the time spent reading the entire book.,"Pros: Robinson creates vivid images of life on Mars. For the most part, the technical aspects added an incredible amount of realism to the story. Which makes for the best kind of science fiction. I especially enjoyed the chapters that made the space elevator come alive in the imagination as we may never get to see it elsewhere.Cons: His explorations into the sociology,sexuality, and psychology of his characters were often boring,always lengthy,and sometimes unexpectedly and disturbingly crass. (i.e. not for the kids to read)If that weren't bad enough,he also attacks Christianity of all types with a sledge hammer. Declaring it repeatedly as an archaic religion for a band of greedy idiots. All other types of faith are regarded as ""interesting"" and ""progressive"". Robinson could have introduced his ideas into the story without being so heavy handed and long winded. Unfortunately he did not."
2,is okish.... maybe...,"well... I read 150 pages. I would normally keep reading on, but... it wasnt good... or bad. And since I have like 30 unread books on my shelf, I decided to skip it. I was just not into it.... here is why.It is SF... barely. It is about a guy, that is very very ambitious.... who plays of stereotypes of different cultures to better himself... on Mars.The author loves to throw in random science sounding stuff... that has no bearing on anything plot wise. Was like, he had this idea about an ambitious guy, but wanted to write in based on mars, so he just added SF stuff to spice it up. I want more SF oriented stuff... but.... I didnt get it."
2,Good sci-fi decends into bad politics,"Red Mars started off just dandy, with a variety of characters (a bit too one-dimensional, but hey) struggling with how to best colonize Mars. No one was a 'good' guy or a 'bad' guy - just good hard sci-fi mixed with honest ideological differences.Halfway through the book, however, it all changed. All of a sudden, Trans-national corporations are launching nukes, after buying out the United Nations. Christian fundamentalists try to dominate the colonies. A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies, while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos, primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end. I'll only read the sequels because I want to read all the Hugo and Nebula award winners - not because I have any hope for the rest of the series."
2,Technical Guide To Mars Living,"A Scientific Fiction is supposed to be read as a fiction! This book is rich of all kinds of scientific details about immigration to Mars, unfortunately, it makes extremely boring reading. Sure, this book will give you a lot of knowledge about Mars, but why not just read it on Nature? A technicial manual is not a fiction for leisure reading."
4,"Jack of all trades, master of none","The chances are, you'll either love it or hate. Being me, I just didn't mind it (but then I've actually bothered to comment on it, so it must have had something). The book tries hard to master every single aspect of literature there is - from intrigue, politics, character studies... all the way to science fiction and beyond. What a shame that the plot is fairly uninspiring and ultimately unimaginative (the phrase ""ran out of steam"" might well apply), which also seems to sum up each aspect of the book as a whole. Worth reading, but by no means an epic."
5,NO WORDS....NO WORDS....CAN DESCRIBE THIS BOOK,"I don't know where to begin. Theres so much. I can say this. Red Mars is the BEST Sci-fi book ever written. It was written so believeably, and elegantly, and so beautifuly that you can't even begin to descirbe.Kim Stanley Robinson has created a masterpiece. The scale of Red Mars is breath-taking. For those of you who say he described the landscape to much, you've got a lot to learn about sci-fi. For me, it helped me feel the spirit of Mars, helped my to connect with the character's (Many that there where) feelings about the planet and about what they were doing to it. I can understand how Ann loved Mars in its pristine beauty.This is a book that opened my eyes to another planet thats just next door, and to the possibilities for the human race."
1,"Yawn, boring.","When I read a book, there should be characters that I can relate to and care about. The immaturity of the characters gave the book an 8th grade/soap-opera feel. There should be a plot that excites. Not with this book. It started out good with a murder and landing but it quickly descended into scientific minutae. I'm not that interested in Mars dust or lunar cycles. I gave up and didn't finish this book."
2,Tediously detailed,"I'm still trying to read this one. It's got just enough story that I want to find out what happens, but there's so much boring detail to drag through that it's taking forever. I try reading a paragraph, but then get distracted by a speck of dust on my desk that's tremendously more interesting than reading yet another two-page description of yet another crater. Which, boringly enough, is exactly like the last crater, except this one's a little bit bigger. Or maybe it's smaller. Or has a different mineral composition. I'm really not sure, as I'm learning to skip ahead as soon as anyone drives into or flies over a crater.If the science part of sci-fi appeals to you more than the fiction part (far, far more), this is a great book. But if you like the fiction aspect better, or even just want a balance, you're probably best just skipping this one."
1,I'm glad I only bought the first book.........,"I'll make this as short as possible...........like I wish the book would have been. This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be. I got halfway through, and quit. It was so boring. I wanted, (as always), a good story, not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet. I can't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work. He can, in no way, be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field."
4,More science than fiction - but still terrific!,"Robinson's novel is great, particularly if you're interested in how a colony on Mars might actually start. On the other hand, if you are not quite as excited about knowing the science in detail, you may want to consider reading something else. I was reminded a bit of Moby Dick in some spots: those chapters describing 19th centry whale processing technology in excruciating detail were never my favorites. You'll get a bit of that here, too. But Robinson usually stops short of the nauseating level of detail.The characters were interesting and multi-faceted. The shifting narrator perspectives were especially enjoyable.I'm looking forward to reading Green and Blue."
2,Red Mars: Not great for an award winner!,"I was very disappointed in this book. For an award winning book, I expected it to be tremendous. It was very slow reading and very light on real science fiction. I think it would be better for someone who liked soap operas and science fiction. Someone would really have to work on me to get me to try the sequels. I will grant that there was a tremendous amount of character development, but that isn't tops on my list for a sci-fi boo"
5,A Classic,"Robinson achieves a pitch perfect balance of real science and fiction in Red Mars. The story of the 100 colonists is gripping. From John Boone, the legend, Coyote, the mysterious stowaway and the computer-like Sax Russell, there are characters in this read that you will not forget. The Drama is first class and keeps you coming back for more in the following two books. The revolution that occurs is really well written. After reading this book you will not look into the nighttime sky the same ever again. Red Mars may very well be a novel that is prophetic in its depiction of the future. I also highly recomend some music to accompany the reading- for some good sugestions read the next review! Enjoy!"
5,Highly imaginative,"Robinson's prose may not always sparkle, his narrative may plod along from time to time, and his characters may lack a dimension or two. No matter. In the space of 600 pages, Robinson creates, in breathtaking detail, an entire world, and a believable world at that. For anyone who still harbord dreams of being an astronaut or stepping on the moon, Red Mars is a must read. I look forward to reading the companion volumes."
1,Kindle Edition == Rife with Typos!,"A good read I'm revisiting after 15 years as a way of learning to read comfortably on the iPhone Kindle client.The conversion is quite disappointing. Line breaks/word spacing is atrociously handled and ellipses become something like ""Blah blah blah. .."", but the real issue is that there are particularly bad typos left and right.""Precious"" instead of ""previous"", ""-"" instead of ""="" in equations.... I would have followed up purchased the sequel (Green Mars) in the Kindle edition had it not been for the dense stream of meaning-changing typos present in this freebie.I sincerely hope this isn't a sign of things to come for other print-to-kindle conversions!!!! Amazon -- this is a featured freebie to show off your platform with a famous-within-its-niche book... can you get it right?"
3,KSR is no Alistair Reynolds,"I read this one having just finished everything AR wrote and really digging the ""hardness"" of it, if that makes sense. This is ""hard"" sci fi in a way that is dry as hell and the characters are underdeveloped and pretty much soulless. It's nice and long, though, so it's got that going for it. If you're super into geology you'd probably dig it more than I did."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought the paperback years ago and burned through the first third of it, thinking how awesome it was. Once into the second third or so, it doesn't take long before the pace dies and you find yourself falling asleep trying to finish it. I set it down.Years later, I thought I'd give it another try only to find that I had given it away, so I picked it up on Kindle. This time I did make it to the end, but wow was it painful. The writing is excellent. The characters are realistic. The science is sound. It.just.moves.soooooo.sloooooooow."
2,A struggle to finish,"I loved the concept, an epic series of colonizing Mars - but the book rambles endlessly. I don't need to be taught pseudo-science on terraforming. Just tell me the basics and I'll willingly suspect my disbelief. I don't need pages of math & science - it doesn't add to the literary value.I had no interest in the other books in the series."
5,This epic novel is insanely good.,"Amazing, amazing book. The depth and breadth of the decades-long plot, the huge cast of vivid and distinctive characters, and the novel's hard science foundation combine make this the best book I have read in years. Many, many years."
3,"Over-rated, over-sold and not good for SF","I find it hard to countenance that such a best-seller as RM should be so sadly lacking in anything so mundane as a good story. It does the whole genre of SF a diservice if books such as this grab such a large portion of market share. RM does nothing to alleviate the charge commonly levelled at SF that it's a genre for geeks and technophiles with no interest in human realities or human emotions. Granted, KSR has done an incredible job at excavating the reality of Martian settlement; a pity only that he couldn't have done the same with an engaging story."
1,"Great idea, but characters are terrible and ruin it","I just finished reading Red Mars and was so disappointed. This book had so much potential going into it, but in short the characters suck. The main characters in Red Mars are all part of the first 100 people to colonize Mars. You don't get to meet all 100 of them (thank god), but out of the ones you do meet there is not one of them that is likeable. This lack of any characters to get attached to or even like a little makes reading Red Mars a painful experience. There are some good ideas about Mars, the technology to live there, and ways to terraform it all presented from characters that are just not enjoyable."
1,the theme of Terraforming Mars deserves a better author,"I ordered all three of these books,thinking they would be a treat. Alas, I fell asleep over Red Mars, but I finished that one, just because I hoped it would get better. But Green and Blue MArs were to much to endure, boring characters going through improbable adventures and getting immortal in the process; that is if they were not killed in the full scale war between the settlers of Mars and the bad guys from Earth that they author envisaged. Really, it was totally uninspired and to boring to endure!"
1,This was incredibly boring,I love science fiction and I was excited they offered a few different books for free for the Kindle. I was interested in finding some new authors to read...I will not be reading this one again.I didn't finish the entire book which is rare for me. I'm an avid reader and I can read quickly- this book was like quicksand. The deeper I got into the book the more I wanted out. I couldn't finish the book b/c it was so freaking boring. I've read a lot of science fiction and am tolerant of very descriptive passages but I kept on thinking this would of been better as a movie rather than a book and that is a first for me. The author gets so completely weighed down in his descriptions- images would of sufficed! Wtf...where was the editor on this one? I really dislike rating a book poorly b/c I realize that enjoying a book is largely subjective but I could not stand this one.
3,"Great idea, great descriptive skills; poor plot,characters.","I was impressed with Kim Stanley Robinson's knowledge of Mars but I felt he really did not have a handle on the characters and the plot. The focus on environment, i.e., the Red Planet, left the characters undeveloped, the plot meandering. Robinson could have used a good copy editor to tighten this work up. I think he has the same weakness as other hard science fiction writers, such as Arthur C. Clark, in that they are superb in describing the science and how things work but leave much to be desired in characterization and plotting. Because it was such hard going I do not have much of an urge to read the two other books in the triology"
3,Rather long and hard,"It feels like going to work every time I pick up the book. Too much detail, too much politics."
1,BORING!,"Being intrigued by human exploration of Mars and coupled with the fact that this book was a Nebula Award winner, I eagerly purchased ""Red Mars"" and the other two books in the series. Big mistake! Halfway through the book and bored to tears, I quit reading it - something I NEVER do. In fact, this book was so bad that I decided instead to paint my house.If you are looking for a good hard sci-fi book on Mars, try Ben Bova's ""Mars."" In the meantime, I will be trading in my Robinson books for some improvement reading - maybe a Mack Bolan book....."
1,Left wing propaganda,"The author spends 100's of pages trying to hide his left wing views, then half way through the second book in the trilogy he cuts loose with outright socialism and takes several nasty hacks at anyone who believes in freedom. His version of socialism of the future is so sponge brained I had to put the book down."
1,Not very good,"Similar to those made-for-TV movies on the Sci-Fi channel. Not very imaginative and at times, actually boring. Try the Hyperion series instead."
1,Walking through five miles of swamp has to be more fun.,"It was all I could do to muster the enthusiasm to read while engaged with this novel. Why? Very Technical. So much so it got into the way of the story. Disguised propaganda encased in a story? Yes. The idea of the story cloaked in this book kept me reading. If you must have the experience of pain reading this book, but do not want to read it, cut off a toe with a razor. You may feel the same after is all over."
5,Crazy Good Books,"There is only one other trilogy that I devoured with as much fervor and hated to see it end and that was the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. These books are crazy good, written in a style that hooks you immediately and makes you care for the characters. I'm now reading the newest Robinson trilogy, I've just finished the first one and it's just as crazy good."
2,Booorrinnnnngg!!,"I had heard so much about the trilogy, with so many Hugos and Nebulas and whatnot, and being a major SF fan, I bought all three books before taking #1 for a test drive. I managed to finish #1, but was very disappointed in the tedious storylines following too-blah characters. Every one is annoying, and the only partially interesting one croaks at the end of the first book. sigh... When I lost book #2 in a taxi with only 100 pages til the end, I didn't even bother to replace it..."
2,2 stars is kind of generous. Might should give it 1 1/2,"Don't believe the high praise many give this book. The characters are all unappealing and impossible to connect too, the events are frequently unrealistic, and the book drags terribly at times. It certainly isn't all bad. Sometimes it seems as if it's about to get positively interesting but it always manages to get back off track. The idea: the first colonist on Mars deal with idealogical conflicts about how to treat this new frontier could have made a compelling book. But in this case, it didn't."
2,Three Times and I am Out,"Bought the trilogy a number of years ago. Started to read it twice, the second getting 160 pages in. When I saw it on Kindle, decided to give it a determined go. If you are into watching grass grow, then this book is for you. There are a large number of so so reviews recently which I would guess are people who picked this up via Kindle for free. Pages upon pages of scientific detail and meanderings. Made it nearly half way this time, but when I found myself simply turning pages looking for the end to the current dissertation, I asked myself why was I trying to keep on going. The characters simply get overwhelmed bythe scientific discourse. I mean, what is the point in reading a book where you are turning pages to avoid reading. This is not to say that this book might appeal to those who are interested in what it might take to colonize Mars, but for me, I would rather read NASA articles."
5,Kim Stanley Robinson Does Mars - RED,"This whole series: RED, GREEN and BLUE, fully explores Mars like we wish we could, but can't afford.Character development as is usual with Kim Stanley Robinson is great as are the various scientific aspects of the books [you actually learn some actual science ].Lots of adventure and excitement throughout make it an enjoyable read from start to finish. I've read this series twice now, IT'S THAT GOOD."
2,Well done but not for me,"Red Mars is a little more hard sci-fi than I prefer. If you prefer science over story, then you will probably enjoy this book. I think KSR is a marvelous writer & his tale is a good and compelling one, it's just not my taste."
1,GEOGRAPHIC,"This was the first and last Robinson book I read. Too many geographical details- the characters were unsympathetic and the story line lacked creativity. I guess I should have read one of the other colored Mars first. However, I thank Robinson from sparing me from the desire to read any more of them- my time on Earth is limited. If I were you, your time on Mars should be limited, too. This was also the last science fiction genre that I read- it made me realize that it's not for me, and for that, I also thank the author."
2,Pathetic.,"I wanted to stop reading this book after I had read about 20 pages, but forced myself to read about 300 pages more of it, until I decided it really wasn't going anywhere. The writing is really dry and boring, the descriptions of martian terrain are very repetitive and needlessly detailed, the characters one dimensional. What a waste of time!"
4,Idealistic scientists settle Mars and make it like Earth.,"Red Mars is very strong on the inevitable political tensions that would occur in a colonization. The tension between the enviros and ""terraformers"" is quite vivid and the characters well drawn. I don't read much sci fi, but I'm encouraged to move to the next book in this trilogy. I'm recommending Red Mars to friends as a fascinating story."
4,"Creative, origional thinking, some what abstract.",Nice reading. A little slow in some places and some what lose in holding it all togeather but refreshing.
5,Excellent introduction to science fiction,"An excellent written piece of science fiction, paints a picture in your mid that enduring and thought provoking. May give a glimpse into the future history of the Human race...."
5,"incredible geographical, emotional, and physical detail","I have to admit that when I picked up the book that the content seemed to leave wide open what an interpretation of colonization would be like; in this I wasn't disappointed. Simply because Kim Stanley Robinson has given us a major insight on how the human condition as well geographic change can affect us as human beings.I marvel at how the author can take such an international cast and weave a story of love, hatred, isolation and geographic differences in such a way that is seems the author was there for the whole trip.I am definately looking forward to completing the other two books in the series. I will then of course expect to add my voice to those as well.Scott Olson"
2,Slow and pointless,"I am a die-hard science fiction fan and this trilogy is what I usually like -- plausible science, fully developed characters. However, the pace is not just slow, it barely moves at all, and the plot gets lost along the way. This is the third time I have tried to read it, and I still couldn't finish -- too boring. There are long, long monologs on the science, and tensions in relationships that keep you hoping for some fireworks that in many cases never materialize.These are the most boring personalities that I have seen in fiction in a long time. The story never really engages you. Spend your time reading something else."
4,Comment on the Kindle Edition,"I love this book and I've enjoyed my paperback for years. I was delighted by the giveaway of the free Kindle edition, but it's worth a note that the map at the front of the book is utterly illegible on the Kindle. This is totally fixable -- it just needs to be resized and reoriented in the proper aspect ratio. IMO the publisher should expend a small bit of effort to make sure that the ebook edition is just as readable and enjoyable as the print version."
2,"A long hard journey that's up and down, up and down, full of craters","The only reason that I did not enjoy this long read was: it's focus on the hardcore Sci-Fi reader. I'm not saying it's a bad book, just not for me. The author crams so much geology,theology, psychiatry,topography and much more in the book that it all becomes overwhelming. He seems to remind us throughout the entire read(which I couldn't wait to end)about the same terrain over and over, the color of the sky and the types of volcanoes,mountains,craters,cracks and more craters with the same explanation. To hardcore for me. A true fan of any book about the colonization of Mars, you will love it. I couldn't wait to leave the planet.For better books based on Mars, I would suggest Robert Heinlein's ""Red Planet""(see my review) or Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles""."
2,Promising...if it wasn't for the politics,"A very promising premise falls flat on its face, due to too much emphasis on the phsycology of the main characters. We see very little of the scientific and engineering problems associated with colonising a new planet. Instead, we are treated to pages full of personal vendettas, political infighting and finnaly ( of all things!) civil war. Sadly, this book has alot in it about politics, and very little about the colonisation of a new world. A shame really, considering the immense knowledge the author has on the subject."
2,Enjoyed the attention to detail but fell asleep from the action & the plot,"I'll make this short and to the point. I can appreciate the author's attention to the scientific and political details, however, the action and plot was a snoozer. I only read the first book of the series and do not plan on purchasing or reading any of the remaining volumes. I felt the author spent way too much time and pages giving environmental descriptions and character development and too few pages to plot and action. I found the reading laborious and dull. In addition, if I really wanted to know all of the scientific names of every crater, canyon and mountain on Mars, I would have taken Astronomy in college."
3,Slow but accurate,"Overall, this book is a fairly interesting look at what it might be like if humans colonized Mars, complete with political squabbles and human failings. The best aspect of Robinson's book is the incredible amount of realism he has introduced. It is as if he was actually part of the expedition working as the historian and personal chronicler. Some of the seemingly real events he describes include the multi-year sandstorms, technology use to increase atmospheric temperature and bio-domes. On the downside, the pacing is a bit slow at points and the descriptions of some of the land forms and climate gets tiresome for someone who does not get extremely excited by such details."
1,Slow and tedious,"With this novel, Kim Stanely Robinson starts the award winning Mars trilogy. As a geologist, I can appreciate the incredible amount of research that has been placed into this novel and the attention to detail is phenomenal. But, it was bit of a relief to get to the end."
2,"may have the science, but it misses everything else","This book is a classic example of what's wrong in science fiction. It's all science and no fiction. I felt quite let down after all the hype. The character development especially could use some work. In example: Maya Toitovna. She is as original as a Bond girl. A tough, ball beaking sexy Russian scientist?? The people are narrow and the plot is hackneyed to the point that the interesting subject of (terraforming) is rendered uninteresting. I really tried to enjoy this novel (and green and blue..) but was unable. If it helps you use the review: favorite authors/books include: Card (enders et al) Cherryh (cyteen, hellburner) n.lee wood (faraday's orphans) le guin (left hand darkness)and stephanson (snow crash) All of these authors have exellent charachters, innovative plot and include sometimes wildly speculative fiction. All in all, I hope you enjoy this series more than I."
4,Scientific Poetry,"Red Mars is like nothing I have read. It's a story of the first hundred people to colonize Mars. The plot is a bit predictable, but interesting nonetheless, and a sort of mystery develops early on in the book. Set in a world described in excruciating detail, I was awed by how scientifically accurate this book was, making it very believable. I'm normally not a fan of political struggles, but Kim Stanley Robinson has made the political struggles of the Red Planet worth reading about, and very intriguing. I would not call this a traditional sf work. This is beyond FICTION....it could easily be our future; a some-day history book."
4,A good book,"This is a good book, although certainly not the best I've ever read. It drags in parts, but you can tell that the author has really researched the topic. Also, I found it interesting that someone has actually considered the politics and economics of going to Mars -- this is something we will need to think about if we are going to send a mission to Mars some day -- are we going to destroy the environment of Mars like we've destroyed the environment of Earth?I'd recommend it if you are a science fiction fan, but if you don't usually read science fiction you might find it uninteresting."
2,"Interesting at times, but too slow and unbelievable.","This series had great potential, but had two major flaws; long rambling descriptions of terrain, and unrealistic expectations of science and people. After reading the first book, I thought that the second would be better (how much terrain could the author possibly write about?), but I was disappointed to find more of the same in the second book.Skip this series."
1,Red Mars = Huge disappointment!,"After all the wonderful reviews and a Nebula Award given to Red Mars I expected a lot. I fail to see the appeal of this novel. Robinson has little talent for character development leading to unbelieveable and boring characters. Out of 572 pages I would be surprised if the you could amass 25 pages of dialogue. How can you develop characters without having them interact with one another. The book is one long boring narative with spurts of minute scientific detail that add nothing to the story. I felt that Robinson was only trying to impress me with his research and depth of the scientific knowledge rather than tell me a story. Red Mars has the dubious honor of being the first science fiction novel that bore me to death. Want a good read about Mars? Read Ben Bova's ""Mars""."
2,Boring,"Wayyyy too much technical detail, cardboard-ish characters and no obvious plot. I get that this is part 1 of a trilogy - all the mo0re reason that it should get you hooked. Nope. Just phenomenally boring boring boring details. Never seems to get to the point. Probably because there isn't one. 2 stars because it isn't the worst book I ever read, just mostly bad."
3,"Complicated, but well-constructed","This novel moved quite slowly for me. I got a bit thrown off by all the different narrators at first, but then started to appreciate the different view points."
3,So slow,"A lot of description but not much action. Whenever something big and interesting happens it is described in a paragraph or alluded to. Detailed descriptions of the surrounding, thoughts and reflections on events are dragged on over pages. If you like fast paced sci fi' skip this one."
2,Not for me,Am a big SiFi fan. I just couldn't get into this one. The pacing is slow and uneven. The beginning is confusing and I couldn't get beyond it.
1,Robinson is not another Edger Rice Burroughs,"Not even close. I bought the series based on the Nebula and Hugo Awards. What a HUGE mistake....and I will never trust those particular award juries again. This guy does not have much to say, but says it repeatedly, exhaustively, and ad nauseum. The characters are exclusively two dimensional, all lacking passion and driven by inexplicable logic to actions that make little sense. The extensive descriptive narrative is mind numbing and filled with geological jargon. You spend most of the book wading through this blah blah blah, and when something finally does happen, it is disappointinly anti-climactic. I will never buy another piece of literature by this author."
1,A VERY STRONG DISSAPOINTMENT,"When the movie ""Mission to Mars"" camed up, and i started reading the Carl Sagan books, I decided to read this books beacuse they were recommended to me, but then i started reading them, and guess what?, IT'S AN INFINITE BOOK!, This book it's very, very, very, very, very, very very, very very, very, BAD!, it's the worse book i had ever red, beacuse all that they do in this book it's nothing but POLITICS!there is no page in the book that dosen't talk about politics!, It's a disaster, if you want to read a excelent book about Mars, read all the book of Carl Sagan, read ""The Mystery of Mars"" by Graham Hancock, read anything you want about Mars or even see ""Mission to MaRS"", BUT DON'T BUY ANY OF THIS BOOKS!, THEY ARE NOTHING BUT BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE VORTEX OF THE MOVIE ""MISSION TO MARS""."
5,Blown away,"I have almost nothing but good things to say about this entire series. This book kept me on the edge of my couch the entire time! I'm kind of nerdy, so all of the technical details really added to the richness of the picture for me. This shot straight to the top of my favorites.The ideas covered in this were also very mind-expanding. I do have to say, I wish there was more time given to any kind of gayness or a gay struggle in this. Women enjoyed great status, however. I liked that."
1,Mediocre & Juvenile,"...as are the many gushing and giddy, over-the-top reviews of this book and this series."
2,Boycott Publishers like this Who DISABLE speech-to-text,"If a publisher wishes to restrict their product (by DISABLING speech-to-text), I wish to restrict my purchases. BOYCOTT"
3,Slow ride to mars,"Some of my friends had read this (and its sequels) and it won a few awards, so I figured I'd give it a try. After all is said and done, I know a lot more random facts about Japanese and Arabic culture, the fundamentals of psychology, astrophysics, biology, and materials science; but I can't say I really enjoyed the book much.The trouble for me was that I look to science fiction as an escape from reality, not the written form of a documentary on the Discovery channel. If you're looking for lots of ""hard"" science, or enjoy fiction that's long on characters and short on action, then this book will suit you well. I just couldn't get excited reading about somebody wandering around in his rover, going from camp to camp and having philosophical discussions about the role of women in Bedouin culture.Things do start to pick up around 500 pages in, but in a book with slightly under 600 pages that's not quite soon enough for me."
1,forget about it,yeah forget about this cd. since christine flores lost her top notch voice and her very pretty black hair. the only good thing about this cd is that there is no skits.
1,No Beyonce,I really don't like this. She should quit trying too act like Beyonce. Beyonce is her own person.
3,Christina turned into Britney,"While the opening single ""Dip it low"" is quite nice, the other tracks are rather boring. Christina turned in some sort of soul-pop-Britney. Blonde hair, sexy image and empty songs. Why that ? She used to write such good songs - also for other artists. There is no need to sell oneself for a sexy image. Christina, you can do much better"
3,NICE POP ALBUM,"I thought that this would be an off the hook urban album, but most of it is weird pop (the songs are nice though.) I was finally excited, after being a CM fan since 2001. I loved ""AM 2 PM"" and I was dissapointed that she didn't recieve success in the US. Now she has a HOTTT single ""Dip It Low"" which is burning up the charts. The song doesn't really represent the album well. It is mostly pop, as I mentioned. Best songs on the album are: ""Highway,"" ""I'm Sorry,"" ""Someday One Day,"" ""Miss U Like Crazy"" and ""L.O.V.E"" As I said, the album is nice, but if you are expecting a headbanging R&B album, this is NOT the album for you."
5,Diz Cd,"Well well well Christina milian your rite It's About Time.... lol naw lemme stop i been a christina milian fan eva since she was on da disney channel....from then to da movie wit da kids...to american pie..to clueless..to charmed..i seen them all...cuz imma true Christina milian fan....i bought da Am to Pm cd it was hot...but da It's About Time Cd was hotter and i really like da song ""7 Days"" b-cuz it a party song and i was like whoaaaaaa diz song is tight...and i like ""Im Sorry""...i like da intro too i got it on my celly voicemail ...but besides all that DA CD IS EXCELLENT GO BUY IT IS ONE OF THE BEST CD.....SHE REALLY COULD SING betta than Ashanti and Brandy...im sorry Ashanti and brandy but CM sing betta....."
4,FINALLY!!!!!,"I've been waiting for an album from Christina since she did Get Away w/ Ja Rule. Now its finally here and i'm not disappointed. I loved the album from jump. She has the RnB sound w/ a pinch of Hip-Hop and a smidge of Pop. The one song that pops out at you and will turn u off is Peanut Butter and Jelly, but looks are deciving, that song is a crazy club banger, it should be her next single. Its a great all around album, and their is more meaning than you think behind some of these songs, like ""Highway"". GO COP THIS SH*T!!!!"
3,Stick to the dance tracks,"Christina Milian has 2 styles on her album It's About Time. One is her sexy, funky side. Upbeat dance tracks that will make you move. The other is sexy and boring. Her dance tracks are killer. First single Dip it Low is hot, sexy, and undeniably catcy. Second single Whatever You Want is even better. Its fun, and one of those tracks you always gotta dance too. Peanut Butter and Jelly, while a silly title, is still hot. However, the rest of the album is filler. Boring ballads about love. Christina Milian doesn't have the best of voices. Shes right there with JLO and Ashanti. Girls who can kind of sing, so when she tries to sing ballads, her voice is very thin and breathy and makes some of the songs unlistenable. It would help if they were at least good songs. I do like Christina Milian. She has some awesome dance tracks. She just needs to stick with those and forget those boring, droppy ballads."
3,Not a solid album.,"This album really deserves a 2. The only reason I gave it a 3 is the fact the ""Dip It Low"" is definately on fire. I am typically a big fan of this type of R&B/pop. I like all of her contemporaries: Mya, Ashanti, to name a few. But I am not feeling this album. Maybe the single made me expect more. I do wish her luck."
4,ITS ABOUT TIME,After her spotlight was stolen so few years ago Christina reinvents herself with a hot and solid effort ITS ABOUT TIME. Pack with slow jams and dance tracks this is a must have for the summer!!
5,dance i said!!!!,"first of all to tough_mf_from_mich, everybody has thier own type of music and the women you speak of are not selling thier bodies, especially kylie minogue who has been singing top hits since the early 80's. now the cd, christina rocks, to me she sounds like PAULA ABDUL in some songs, and if you all don't know paula is curently working on her 5th album, first album in 10 years. christinas songs are fun,sad,sexy & good. her cd is good, i was unsure if ii wanted it and then i told my self after seeing the video for dip it lo that i had to get this cd. also check out nick lachey's cd soulO, it is excelent, not real poppy, more of a rock sound with a few dance/rock songs. enjoy!!!"
4,Christina Milian,This is a good CD.I love it. Its the greatness of Christina Milian's voice. Joe Budden appears on 2 of the tracks & Fabulous on 1.Its a great CD & i recommend buying it!Peace up A-Town down!
5,EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS HOT,Let's get right to the point all the songs on this cd is hot.From the intro to the last song you will like every last song.She has some of the best slow jams I have ever heard.And her party tracks are true fire.Her beats for her song are great.Every last song has a hot beat.If you don't have this cd you should get it.This is a great cd a must have.
1,dedicated to Eric...she looks like a porn star....,"Pulllleeeease.....I guess these tarts come and go...Brittney sounds like Milli Vanilli....Hillary Fluff, etc....I'm from Cali too, but music is music. This ain't."
2,Its About Time to Stop,She sounds like a latino version of Britney Spears...all looks and no talent. Her high pitch vocals are obviously engineered and still she sounds like one of the Chipmunks.
1,sucks,this cd really really sucks. since this cd only has like two good songs. and why did christine flores have too dye her hair yellow for while she looked hotter with her black hair.
1,One good song. Datz it,"""Dip It Low"" is the only reasonably catchy song here. The rest is pure, unmitigated filler that can never even hope to meet up with today's standards of enjoyable pop music. Instead of making one hit and then slavishly slopping together an album, they should have maybe released the single and then waited a long time to put together an album so it would actually be consistently good."
1,Really disappointed....,"I was really hoping that Ms. Milian would treat her fans right after letting us down by not getting her first album released in the US. AM to PM was such a great song...and not getting the first album was a let down but liveable....and then when DIP IT LOW came out, I got so excited! A new album from Christina Milian that MIGHT get released here! But, then, to buy this CD and discover that DIP IT LOW is the only good song....what a waste of time in listening and money to get the privilege. Trust me, buy the new Celine Dion live set or Bond's CLASSIFIED instead. They're much better than this tripe."
2,about someone saying she was imitating j lo on this CD,"to me it sounds more like a desperate beyonce imitation, that didnt work."
5,Good album!!!,This girl is hot and all the songs she sings are hot! Go out and buy this album because it has good R&B beats. She deserves to be recognized!
5,Four old friends,This is not really a childrens' book. It's dialect retelling makes it hard to understand just as the original Uncle Remus tales did a few generations ago. It is actually the story of four elderly outcasts from society whose friendship saves them. Together they can take care of each other and find that life is still good.
5,Good saw,A very nice saw that arrived in perfect condition. I used the saw right out of the box and it did a fine job. Price is a bit high but quality is rarely cheap. I had cheaper saws that could never cut a straight line.
5,Best buy!,I highly recommend this saw! It more than lives up to it's name. It has more features than its competition for very close to the same cost. It also takes the abuse of a job site much better! The best features are the LED light and the extra long cord. If you want a jig saw that you will look for reasons to use...this is the one.
5,Excellent Jigsaw,"I have a lot of jig saw experience and this is the best jig saw I have ever owned. The blower works great, blowing sawdust out of the way. The orbital action is awesome, letting you adjust from very fine work to ripping fast through thick lumber easily. The selling point for me was the tooless shoe tilt and the fact that Milwaukee made it. You can't beat Milwaukee. Don't make the mistake I did and try to save a few bucks on a cheaper saw... you will end up replacing it down the road anyways. Also, buy some good blades for it. It only comes with two.(It also comes in a case, which is a must for me.)"
2,Not one of her best,"You can tell this is one of those 80s romances where the heroines were meek and moronic and spineless. Camille annoyed the heck out of me, she was wishy-washy and idiotic and at least the book wasn't a hardback because it left no mark when I threw in against the wall. Ms. Brown has done MUCH, MUCH better since this, but I suppose at the time it came out this was the norm, like some of the old Linda Howard books."
4,Like It,If you are a fan of rekindled/refound love then you will enjoy this. Sandra Brown is one of my favorite authors. She can bring a story together in a way that makes you not want to put it down.
3,"Sweet, but not my favorite","I'm just catching up with my reading of my favorite author. This is an older book that I picked up at Half Price Books on clearance for a dollar. This was about two star-crossed lovers who met at a Utah ski trip, only to meet up 2 years when the female character, Camille an Interior Decorator, was hired by the Zach's (male character) widowed father to renovate their antebellum mansion. The book mentioned some of the mansions that I've had the privilege to visit during to Natchez. Sandra Brown is my favorite writer and it just so happens that she's from my home state of Texas. This was not my favorite short book by the author, but it's entertaining just the same."
1,Dumbest story ever? Maybe!,"This story is beyond stupid. I'd like to slap every single character. If even one of them grew up and acted like an adult, none of this relentless angst would be necessary."
3,A bit dated,"Camille is hired to redecorate an aging antebellum mansion for a wealthy client who wants to leave it as a legacy to his son. She's unaware that Zack, the son is the man she had a torrid one night stand with a few years earlier while on vacation, and for some reason, his father is scheming to get them together.This is one of Sandra Brown's early novels and the melodramtic prose and unseemly actions on the part of the hero just make it really dated. But it is one of her better early novels, which unfortunately cannot stand the test of time. Suspense falls will not be impressed with this, but those looking for a little romantic getaway that don't really care about realism will find this charming."
4,Zeppelin Movie Review,This was a movie I had not seen since it came out in the early 70's. It was good to see it again. The seller was very prompt and I would buy again from them.
3,A tale of divided loyalties,"The setting is WWI Britain. A young, German-born, Scottish officer, played by Michael York, has a desk job with the ministry partly due to problems with vertigo. He is recruited to act as a spy and return to Germany to find out what he can about the new Zeppelin project.The premise sounded good, but many of the elements needed to make this into a great story were thrown in haphazardly. His lover seems to be more important than is told in the story. His connections to a well known, German scientist seems serendipitous. His vertigo and divided loyalties are touched on lightly then disregarded. By the time I felt the elements would be pulled together, the movie was over, leaving me mildly disappointed.Elke Sommers is very attractive, but I am not sure why she was in the movie. She had a speaking part, but I don't find that her role was necessary. My guess is that the producers wanted an attractive lady to put on the movie poster.I would not recommend seeing this movie."
5,Sultry Vocals,Bethany is a top rate artist. She takes you places with her voice and choice of songs. She captures the emotional components of historical folk music.
5,Great Planning Guide,"For those of us who travel to London to buy anitiques--or who daydream about doing that, this book is priceless. It offers so many good tips about where to shop for what, and it is written in an accessible, light-hearted style. What beautiful photographs accompany the text!"
3,Summer Hymns - 'Backward Masks' (Misra),"Didn't enjoy this most recent 2006 release as much as I did Summer Hymn's 'A Celebrity Arm Gesture' effort (see my review). Simply a bit too light-weight for me. However, some of the tracks here are well written, I thought - like the mellow ""Way You Walk"", the intricately played ""Pity And Envy"", ""Ice Age World"" and ""14 Inches Of Snow"". More devoted fans of this indie neo-psych band should get more out of this CD than I did. Line-up: Valerie Watson-vocals, Derek Almstead-guitar, Chris Riser-bass, harp, horn & sax, Scott Stapleton-piano and Phillip Brown-percussion."
1,A bad book.,"Some years ago, a friend of me, lent me, this book.I tried to read it.The subject of this book is, the ridiculous author's believes, about catholic power in USA and in all the world.This book is false, ridiculous, outdated, bogus and bigoted.Don't waste your time and money, reading this bigoted and trash-book."
3,Entertaining Enough,"This book is a quick and easy read (although there are sloughs of characters if you're not familiar with the mini-series). It gives good coverage of American History, though it may not be entirely accurate. It's close enough to help with your basic understanding, and perhaps think about American History from a more balanced point of view. As has already been mentioned, the editing in the book is less-than-perfect. I noticed a number of typos/errors during my casual reading."
3,Enjoyed the series; the book..not so much.,"I enjoyed the series, but the edition of the book I have is full of spelling errors and even some major historical ones. On page 177, for instance, it states ""Kansas was part of the territory ceded by Mexico a decade and a half earlier, and as the territory slipped closer to statehood, the delicate balance of power between free and slave states began to tip."" Kansas was part of the Lousiana Purchase in 1803 and was not ceded by Mexico. Sloppy research, sloppy proof reading, but a thrilling read anyway. It will probably be a better experience if you also watch the series."

1,Junk,"I received and returned this phone twice because not only the 1st one received , but even the 2nd one received did not function."
4,Magellan 760 review,The unit operates very well. It has done a good job recalculating a route if you have a better way to go. The only minuses are that they don't tell you how to use the cancel feature to get back to the beginning. They are very difficult to read in the sun light which is the most used mode. I had to design a sun shield to make it readable during the day. I don't know why they don't offer this type of accessory.
1,Magellan has unreliable products and terrible customer service,"We puchased the 760 model new two years ago - it had good reviews from a functionality perspective but what no one realized at the time was the shoddy quality on parts and design. The unit needed repair within the warranty period to replace the cradle where the power connection fits it. Now that it is out of warranty, the same inferior design keeps the Magellan from powering up or staying on. There are postings all over the web for this same issue. Magellan products are poorly designed from a durability perspective and the workmanship is poor. I would never buy their products again - waste of money and time in dealing with their non-existent customer service."
2,defective,I have had mine for 2 years. It has never completly failed but always seams on the edge of it. I have had all of the problems listed in the other post but not quit enough to trash it. It is VERY slow to lock onto a sat. it freezes up and turns itself off for no reason. Periodicaly it will route me off the interstate to secondary streets and back onto the same interstate. My next one will be Garmin without a doubt. At first I was always afraid someone would steal it but now I am hoping someone will. Read these post and read the glowing reviews for the Garmin nuvi and what a difference!
2,Would not buy from this company again.,"I've had this unit for over a year. I had to return it almost immediately for a minor repair which took several weeks, but once we started using it it was fantastic. It was easy to use, fairly reliable (occasionally difficult to get a signal), and cut down immensely on time and stress whenever I had to drive to a new place. However, 2 months ago the unit fell off my windshield and stopped powering up. I figured out that I needed to replace the cradle, but the part was conveniently out of stock when I tried to order a new one, and has been backordered everywhere ever since. I have read many other accounts of frustration about the backordered cradles (and the shoddy manufacturing and materials used in the first place). I'm still waiting to receive my new cradle, and haven't even heard anything about when they will be going out. Magellan has horrible customer service, and I will never buy another product from them again."
2,Way over priced,"For over a grand, this unit is way to expensive. The Garmin C330 and C340 are both hundreds less and much better units. The C340 even has real time traffic, a feature the Magellan units lack.Moreover, an internal battery is a must so you can use the unit outside of the car without a power cord. The Garmin units have it the Magellan units don't.Both companies use Navteq mapping so the maps are as bad or as good as each other. However, the Garmin unit has almost 6 million points of interest in the US while the Magellan unit claims 7 million units but I think that includes the locked up european maps preloaded onto the unit.Save yourself hundreds of dollars and buy a unit that works better, is easier to use, much smaller and has an internal battery."
3,Awesome when it works,"I love this thing when it works but it doesn't work most of the time. I don't know if I just have a bad one or what. Sometimes it will take 30 minutes to get it set up. Sometimes it just won't work no matter what. It continues to locate itself in the former town it was in. When it does work, it is right on the money. My sons won't even use it because its just too much of a hassle to get it to work. I would not tell anyone to buy this model. I think there are less expensive ones that work much better. As much as I paid for this, I will continue to try to use it as much as possible."
2,unsatisfied,The GPS came with no operation manual and the power supply cradle was defective. Lukily I still had the one from my former GPS that was stolen.
3,Maps and Map Updates,"The unit functions OK but the antenna is not sufficient. An external antenna does the job and I now get a good signal. The cost of the antenna about $20.00 to $24.00 if bought from anyone but Magellan.The maps are quite bad and the updates are expensive. However, they have come down a bit. Now about $60.00 and from what I understand, the installation is difficult and may result in a dead unit. Sending it for repair, is another cost which I do not know what that would cost. I can buy a new Garmin with a larger screen for about $120.00.Given this, I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
3,It's OK!,"I brought this navigator a few years back and it still works fine. Function wise, it is OK! My only complaint is the size. Why make it so clumsy? Otherwise, Magellan is a good brand to have."
4,Satisfied,"The RoadMate gets the job done. It isn't the sleekest or smallest GPS but it will get you from A to B, at a very affordable price. The only issue I have faced with the RoadMate so far, is the cost of map updates (around $50.00), but I haven't needed it yet."
1,Menus are worthless!,"How do you store a location? In the manual it says to look into this in the CD! How do you make a location a favorite? I can't! How do you power it if you need to walk with it? You can't!Its big, its powerful, its hard to use, the software for it needs to be changed ASAP! Each button is even more counterintuitive than the next!And... did not find the Holiday Inn in Orlando that's been there 15 years.The only good thing is the price, good for Magellan, bad for the rest of us!Oh yeah I like the reroute service they charge monthly for too! Like $ 1000 is not enough! We are idiots to be paying $ 1000 for this should be $ 400 by now!"
1,"2 magellans 2 times stupid,","A couple of years ago I bought magellan 700 i paid 1200 dollars for it. For that price I thought it was a lot better than it actually is.4 months ago it got broken: I treated it like gold but the touch screen became insensitive. Since the gps sucked I decided to buy magellan 760 because I assumed they improved it. No way!! the maps in several areas are inaccurate but what it makes me mad is that this time the stupid thing got broken in 2 months (I used it 10 times)!!: the screen light is out of order. I sent it to magellan and they wll make me wait almost 1 month to have it fixed.I bought 2 magellans, I am felling 2 times stupid."
4,Reliable GPS,"I owned this GPS for a number of years and it has been very reliable. In fact I think it has worked more accurately and reliably than newer GPS's that I have owned and used. The downside of this GPS now is that Magellan has discontinued any map updates, so you are pretty much stuck on the last map update before they discontinued the update."
5,My trip to my sister's house.,"3000 miles and back, only two times did the unit put me on the wrong road do to constuction. Within a mile the unit put me back on track. VERY VERY GOOD MACHINE.You may not hear of Magellan but I know this is a class A GPS unit..."
3,Magellan losing ground to competitors. TomTom is better,"Magellan, once the king of in-car navigation systems, has been resting on its laurels so long that it is being lapped by competitors such as TomTom and Garmin. The RoadMate series was once ground-breaking, but is now average at best. The Magellan suffers from poor windshield mounting hardware, sluggish touch-screen response, and poor audio quality (lots of background hiss). ?Also the design is getting old ? Magellan has had the same basic look for almost 7 years now. A mute button would also be a welcome addition, as there?s no easy way to turn off the voice prompts if you get a phone call or need to talk to someone else in the car.Strong points for this GPS are a great UI (it?s very easy to use), and bright display. I have posted a much more extensive review on my website: [...]"
1,It really sucks,"This GPS really sucks. This must be the worst GPS in the world. When I take I-35 in Austin, it keeps saying u-turn in some specific areas. Eventually, I found myself circling around in I-35. When I try to go to Houston, it keeps saying u-turn though I already take the right direction. So I had to turn it off. When I want to go somewhere by address, I can not type some specific address since it only takes up to 5000. But the address is like 7500. It is really hard to use this GPS since you will not find some street names. So that makes me really frustrated.You will really regret if you buy it."
1,broken out of box,Used item first time for ten miles and froze up less than half way on trip. Contacted Megellan and they led me thru the steps to clear and reset item. Set trip a second time and froze up out of drive way. No resolve yet.
3,i wish it could find my house!!!,"i have in the past had a road mate 700 that had no problem finding my home, but for some reason the data base on the new model gets all confused about where my house is ,when i am in my drive way it wants me to drive down the street and make a u turn and just keeps looping this, also i had bad info on where foxwoods casino was!!! it said you have arrived and i was in the middle of THE WOODS!!! about 3 miles away from where foxwoods really is, but other than a few glitch's it works fine"
3,A Decent Unit For The Price,Pros.Good voice guided directions. Huge database for poi. Ready to go right out of the box. Easy to use. I never read the directions.Cons.Accuracy varies from 10 feet to 200 feet. Map info need updated. Roadmate 760 could not find newer streets that have been around for 3 years.
1,Disposable NAV,"Works well for 3 months, then problems arose. Touch sensitive screen just broke when it became loose from its frame. Won't work completely afterwards. These roadmates are completely garbage that are assembled and made in Thailand. I'll never ever buy a magellan again. Their customer care doesnt care."
1,Frustrated and Disappointed,"I purchased the GPS unit for my husband as a Christmas gift. After 4 very time-consuming attempts, with telephone technical support, it was clear my unit was not operating properly and would not connect to the satellite system. I will definitely remember my poor experience with the product before making another electronic purchase via amazon.com."
4,wowowweewa,"this product , very nice, wowowweewa , in my country we use maps to look for farms, and there is also a road now under construction. this gps is very nice techmology. i talk later, jinquee"
1,No support!,I paid 300+ dollars for a NEW Magellan GPS less than a year and a half from boat Us ago and they have already declared it obsolete. If you expect any support DO NOT BUY Magellan.
2,Liked while it worked,"The first one I ordered would not turn on. The second one was great, while it worked. It helped me get to all the events during a school competition in another city. It tells you when to change lanes, when to turn and reads the street names. Magellan was recommended to me by my father who has had tried many of the various in car and add on GPS systems.After returning home, I did not use the system for several weeks. When I did, the GPS was not pinpointing my location on the correct street. I rebooted the unit, and it became stuck on the start-up screen and would not respond to anything- even the power off button."
3,"Good, But with exceptions","The RoadMate 760 works as expected except for a couple problems. You can't use a MAC to update the maps, only a Windows PC. Also, if you attach it to the windshield with the suction cup (as directed) on a bright, hot sunny day it will overheat and shut down until it cools off."
2,okay product,"did not like this product. takes time to calculate the position during start up. In today's world, it might be worthwhile investing products like Iphone instead of a navigator"
1,Never buy a Magellan product,I bought qty 2 of Magellan RoadMate 760 when they first came out thinking I am investing in a quality product and I was getting a really nice discount for purchasing 2 at a time. If only I waited for a few more months when Garmin or TomTom came out. This product is always taking us in the longer routes and wakes up @ or after the turn has passed. On top of that the company charges you a lot of money to update your software/maps. My 2 cents go with Garmin or TomTom. I just bought a Garmin for my brother.
1,Incredibly Poor Update Service!!,"I purchased a 760 in 2006, with the promise that updates would be available on a regular basis. Several times in 2007, the unit itself prompted me to go to magellangps.com for new updates, but the website said each time that the update woldn't be available until ""x"", X being a few months in the future.But yesterday, there WAS an update available. For $80 (well, I could live with that if it was a good update), but - a really, really HUGE but - it was NOT available by download, and the DVD they offered could ONLY BE USED ON A PC!!I was stunned, and called their customer support, which confirmed that I COULD NOT UPDATE THE UNIT ON AN APPLE COMPUTER!What a HUGE ripoff. I now have a $300 paperweight . . .never again!!"
2,Don't buy,"I bought this unit a little less than two years ago. At first, it worked fairly well but took quite a while to pick up a signal and find its location. After a while this problem worsened and now the unit doesn't work at all! Also, perhaps all GPS systems are like this, but it sometimes ""gets confused"" in urban areas and does not always give directions that someone who is familiar with the area would take. For example, I was driving locally and was pretty sure of the fastest route but wanted to double check. The GPS system gave me a route that would have taken me twice as long had I followed it. It turned a relatively simple, straight ride into a nightmare with lots of turns and a highway thrown in for good measure! I won't be buying a Megellan GPS again."
2,Works about 10% of the time,"I've owned this Roadmate for almost a year. It is constantly in ""thinking"" mode and never updates my position quickly enough (sometimes it takes up to 15 minutes) and I've only traveled 5 miles from my last destination! I'm about to throw it out since my husband just bought a Garmin Nuvi for his car and it is SO MUCH better. We traveled over 100 miles and it found us within 1 minute. Magellan needs a new product name - maybe Columbus instead!"
2,Bad unit,"I bought it when it came out first in late summer 2005. When it works, it is fine. If freezes often and sometimes will just refuse to ""see"" the satellites even in wide open areas. Maps were old and often would miss many addresses that were old and in urban areas. (But I suspect that might happen with any GPS unit).Upgrade was suggested to overcome these problems. DVDs arrived in time as promised. As son as I connected the unit to start the upgrade, the unit died! Tried different power cord, CLK adapter cord, different outlet... still dead. Am jumping the hoops of technical support for the last hour but I am not sure when I will get this back in order (if ever). Will update on the Customer Service experience when it is complete but I must admit I am dreading it already - 1 hr on the phone and nowhere closer to the solution..."
2,"Unit is good, support really bites","Had the unit now for 2 years, Dec '05. The unit works well. Only complaint is no updates on the maps until Dec '07. But I keyed in an extra digit during product registration, and that is what the unit uses to ""unlock"" the device to update the map. So far 3 phone calls in a week to the ""help"" line, and nothing as to helping me out. I may have paid the upgrade fee for nothing ! Advice- if you do not need support, buy Magellan. If you may need some help - keep looking. I know my next unit will not be Magellan."
1,Terrible customer service and no map update,Maps are out of date and still waiting for the promised update. Customer service outsourced to India is a joke and corporate headquarters doesn't answer emails. Don't buy a Magellan GPS
1,Don't buy this!!!!,"I own a contracting company and we purchased four of these units for our service vans. To date, after six months of use, three of the units no longer work. Customer service has been HORRIBLE. One unit was shipped back for repair and was returned in worse condition. I don't think I would mind the glitches with the units but the attitude of the customer service department has caused me to scrap these units and look for others. Good luck if you have a problem with yours and have to deal with these people."
1,Bad service support for Magellan RoadMate,"Do not trust Magellan Customer support, they do not have data access and do not care about Magellan reputation.I used Magellan RoadMate 700 for one day before smoke came out of the unit and it stopped working. Factory no longer has RoadMate 700 in stock for replacements, and technician promised me a new cradle within 5 days. I called after a week, 1st rep. said unit was not shipped and will be shipped immediately, I called 2nd time and another rep. said that unit was shipped 3 days ago and gave me a tracking number not for my package, I called 3rd time and another rep. said that they do not have part, that they will have it in a week and that it will take them another week to ship it to me.After 7 days of being a ""proud"" owner of Magellan 700 I shipped it back to the company that I bought it from and expecting a replacement for the entire unit now."
1,"In a word, UNRELIABLE!","this is the second 760 I've bought in one year. To be honest, I was never impressed with the functionality. Without the external antenna, it took me sometimes up to 30 minutes to get a signal. But what really angers me is that both units suddenly just stopped working and would not even power up. Zero stars!!!!"
5,It got me out of a jam.,"I purchased the RoadMate 760 portable after a very favorable experience with the Hertz Never Lost system in Oregon. I live in California and have used it to find businesses while on a camping vacation and in nearby cities. On our anniversary, we were able to use it to pull up phone numbers for a movie theater and a restaurant where we checked showtimes and made a reservation. So far, my best experience happened after a concert in the Sierra Nevadas. The crowd was very large and traffic was stalled. We hadn't moved for about 45 minutes. I picked shortest route, surprised that it could find where I was at about 5,000 feet in elevation. It gave me an alternate route. It was a washboard dirt road, but I got home well before the rest of the crowd. It's been very accurate and my technophobe wife feels comfortable using it. Being able to move it from car to car with two college-age children is also a big plus. Each plans to use it on their next ""Road Trip."""
1,Roadmate 760,"As far as the mounting system goes, the windshield mount looks and works as if it came out of a 25cent bubble gum machine. It rattles all the time and when it does not it is only because it has falling of the windshield, the staying power is all of about 15 mins. The actual Magellan is okay apart from the occasional two city off locator. If I sound sarcastic I am because I really disliked the product."
3,"Beware of the mass-market paperback, it's not what I loved","One of the shadowy, half-remembered books in the back of my mind is a big hardcover in a scratchy green cloth binding, a book called Thursday's Child by Noel Streatfeild. I despair of ever finding that book again, because this one, an out-of-print British paperback Amazon found for me after searching for YEARS, isn't the right story. It has the right characters, like the lovely Lavinia Beresford and the central Margaret Thursday, but I fear it has been abridged. With an axe. This is the kind of thing that makes me want to cry."
5,a true classic,I tried to read all of Noel Streatfeild's books when I was in school. This was my favorite followed by Dancing Shoes. I liked them both better than Ballet Shoes which seems to be her most famous. I could relate totally to Margaret's adventurous spirit. I loved the descriptions of fine food and clothes. And when Matron was run off---! I just loved it. There was so much to this story. Make sure you purchase the original full length book.
4,Everything you wanted to know..,"This book brings together material from many diverse sources and disciplines to produce a one stop review of the major issues facing IT educators. It is one of the only books that I have seen that combines discussions on pedagogy, teaching techniques, and curricula. The book has international appeal with examples from several countries. It provides ideas for educators ranging from how to set up a team project, to implmenting a distance education class. For the educator preparing to develop an IT curriculum the articles and comparisons of the various model curricula provide an excellent starting point. One of the best features of the book is the extensive references that are included with each article. These references which often go on for two or three pages are worth the price of the book for the person doing reasearch in any of the areas discussed."
4,Rich source for the IT teacher,"What I like about this book is its focus on learning. It offers practical and specific learning methods and approaches for those who teach IT. I especially like the highlighting of how the learning of teamwork, communications, and problem solving abilities can be integrated into an IT curriculum so these are learnt along with the IT skills.There is also much else on the challenges of teaching IT today that makes this book a rich source of guidance and material for the IT teacher."
4,"Good action, no brain needed :)","Stilish action, nice filmmaker. Cool down your mind and take some fun from shootings. 4 stars for action, -1 star for Dolby Prologic sound. :( Good-priced movie."
1,To much $ for me,"ok let me start by saying you need at least $200 to shell out if you want to use these cards. you need to buy 2 gameboy advance (sp if desiresd), super mario 3 for gameboy advance, an e-reader, a gameboy sp link cable and this pack of cards of corce. why would nintend make it such a hassle to buy all of this wen they could of easaly made all these features avalable on the game? They wont people to shell out all the money they can to make their game a bit better. If you have all these items id buy if if you dont id forget all about it. i was gonna buy it till i found out evry thing i needed. The hassle of haveing two gameboys on your lap swiping cards to wach some guy at nintendo play a level, or to cheat is just not worth it. If you wanna cheat do your self a favor and buy GameShark SP(on ebgames.com $20, not on amazon), or GameBoy Advance Action Replay($20) ."
2,If you like liturgy,"If you like liturgy, you will love this book. The author is deeply into liturgy and all its trappings. He goes into much depth on the history and theology of liturgy that is sometimes used in the Lutheran church.If liturgy makes you a little nervous, this book will scare you. The author goes a bit far in how he recommends things be done. Unfortunately, it seems that we sometimes we worship how we worship instead of God. Of course, this applies to all styles of liturgy.The upshot of all this is that your view of this book depends a great deal on who you are."
1,Disappointed,I was excited to get thid dvd but it played 10 minutes and thrn froze. The disc appears new but wont play.
5,Good stuff,"Through the films ""Ninja"" and the second and third ""Undisputed"" films-I've gotten to know and become a fan of Scott Adkins. I checked out ""Assasination Games"" more for Adkins than Van Damme but I gotta say, that despite his heyday being long over-I really enjoyed seeing the old guy in a new light with this film. Jean Claude plays a really different character than what we're used to here and makes an absolute pro job of it. The film itself is very competent and several levels above what we've come to expect from straight to DVD fare. The action is good and the story is really sharp and well written. As the movie goes along and you sort of start to see where it's heading- you can't help but enjoy the ride. Both Adkins and Van Damme's characters are very relatable and three dimensional though their motives are very different. The two really play well off of each other, and I'd love to see them reunite in a sequel. This is really a good action/suspense flick."
4,finally hes made a comeback,im a huge jcvd fan and ike most i am sad to say that the past 16 years have not been good to him. i have every movie hes made from when he started up until i say that russian prison movie he made in the 2000's but almost every movie hes made in past 12 years has sucked so i was really surprised by this movie there was no corny acting and the movie was pretty good jcvd did a little bit of his martial arts but given his age of course he used weapons now. anyway this movie was very good and you couldnt even tell it was lowe budget at all. anyway if he he keeps up movies like this he will be on his way to a comeback
4,Surprisingly Good,My husband and I watched this movie together. We were expecting the usual Van Damme movie: a bit cheesy with lots of action. There was lots of action but also a good plot and great character building for the type of movie. Hope Van Damme keeps up the good acting.
5,Fantasmo!,"Van Damme is back! Jean Claude Van Damme is back in action in Assassination Games!When one man, on a mission, to kill his target, is haulted, by another assassin.Two assassins join forces to kill the enemy.Jean Claude Van Damme is, Vincent Brazil in, Assassination games!Wilson"
2,wall lamp,"I really liked the look of this lamp, and especially that it has a dimmer switch which you usually do not find on a wall lamp. However, when it came to mounting on the wall, there is a back plate which you secure to the wall. However, the whole weight of the fixture is on the front plate which attaches to the wall plate with 2 screws. While the wall plate is secure, the front plate wobbles and the lamp is not steady. I had to return it because of this. It was a shame because the lamp really looked nice. There was not a problem with the return; refund was issued quickly."
3,Lampls Plus,"Ordered two lamps from Lamps Plus. Lammps are of generally high quality but one had a ""frozen"" switch which did not work. That lamp was promptly returned to Lamps Plus but getting a replacement is taking way too long."
1,Schank thinks he's OK; everyone else stinks,Schank has managed to write a poorly-disguised tribute to himself while bashing all others and saying absolutely nothing new.
3,I wonder where he found the title?,"Interesting title for the book..It seems I have seen it somewhere else before on the web,pertaining to parenting special needs kids...He seems like an author who has written other books,so I suppose one doesnt have to do with the other.This book isnt about the special needs kids,its just that the title caught my eye because I thought there was something about autistic children with that very same exact title"
2,Not even close to the edge of the page,"I was very disappointed in Shank's outlook on child raising--as a parent, Coloring Outside the Lines has huge connotations and yet the author is nowhere near the edge of the page. He obviously has a huge ego as the book revolves around him and not around his readers. Big disappointment."
5,Great Book!,"As an former educator, I have seen first hand the poor state the education system is in today. Children are bored with standard teaching methods and the teachers are bound by what they can do to both pass the shcoolboards test requirements and keep the children interested. Dr Schank in Coloring Outside the Lines gives parents examples and insight in how to explore new ways to spark interest and excite young minds. Interest in subjects that the children will remember long after the test is over. I reccomeed this book to any parent that wants their child to be a survivor in todays schoolsystem and in life!"
2,A little too far outside the lines,"While some of what Dr. Schank condemns about schools is valid, he is too ready to dismiss them as irrelevant to children's education. There are creative and committed teachers who do far more than teach ""test taking"", and his broad condemnation of schools does nothing to encourage their efforts on our children's behalf. He also dismisses literature as an ""unnecessary subject"" and Gardener's theory of multiple intelligences as a ""politically correct view of intelligence"", suggesting that reading and math are the only subjects worth learning. This narrow view of what constitutes education and expertise lessens his credibility as an educational ""expert""."
5,Great buy!,This set is great. All the DVDs were In excellent condition. We have two 5-year old boys and an 8-year old girl. Now that the turtles are coming back they were excited to see the movies that were out when we were kids. They have been played countless times since they arrived two weeks ago and the boys now have ninja fever!
4,TMNT,Its the 4 movies all in one. For the price and the nostalgic factor great buy. I have not watched the new one yet because I bought it to watch the ones I grew up watching.
3,Not bad for a sequal,While this movie is not as good as the first one it still is funny and has exciting moments. The Vanilla ice scene may date this movie but when you watch it now it just makes it more entertaining. It isn't the most intellectual movie but comeon it was made for children and we have to treat it as such
2,image quality,"I'm from Colombia, and i was looking forward to buy the 3 movies all at once; when i heard about this option i thought ii would be great. however image quality is poor like a vhs image.Ah, and the 4 movies comes in 2 disks, if you want to see for instance the second movie, you shall turn de disk backwards"
1,WHAT?!,"Uhhhh... This movie is ""bad""! I loved the first one and I used to love 2 but now that I'm over the age of 7.. what a horrible movie. Way too cartoonish. The first fight scene had a whole bunch of dumb jokes and after every time a turtle would hit a guy they would make a dumb coment like ""awesome"". Then the whole Vinilla Ice thing at the end... HORRIBLE. The way the beat the 2 bad guys mutants was by spraying a fire exsting. in their mouth which made the 2 mutants turn back into their regular selves. I mean how could the makers of the movie do this to the TMNT fans? If I met the makers of TMNT 2 I would slap them in the face! TMNT 3 was better then 2 but... WHY DID THEY GO BACK IN TIME TO JAPAN? STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! I hope someday there's a TMNT 4 that is like the original where it's darker and like the comic, now that would be amazing."
3,The secret of the ooze?,"The turtles return in this action but yet comic movie return. While the story picks up where our heroes were pretty much left off, like where they're staying at and what lays ahead for our favorite reptiles. Though the story focuses on the story on how the turtles came about to their present state and the foot trying their best to get their hands on the last canister of the stuff better known as 'the ooze'. Although the foot got the ooze and created two new mutants known as 'Tokka' and 'Rahza' to tackle their enemies. One of my complaints with the movie is that there's no Casey Jones in the movie, and it don't feel the same without that nut making an appearence in the movie, though the movie I felt that it was still good even with the flaws that the movie has. My other complaint is that Shredder didn't get a proper death but I can't go about changing that. As for any extras, there aren't that many extras to go with in this release. Overall I give this 3 stars out of 5."
3,The Version Made For The Children,"I remember when I first saw this movie when I was little and absolutely loved it. But when I saw it again recently I noticed some things the director changed in this movie. Unlike Ninja Turtles Part 1, this movie is much more light-hearted. Ralph (my favorite character in part 1) isn't the hothead like he was in the first movie and is at times a lot sillier. In fact, all the characters lightened up a bit. While this was definitely a good move for our younger viewers, overall it kinda ruined the individual characteristics of each turtle.The fight scenes are more comedy than action, and the script is mild at best. But overall, it's a great movie to watch with your little brother or cousin.Good movie, but it just can't match up to the first one."
2,Price was good but 1 disc for 4 movies? Can't access other 3 movies!,"Ok, so bought this for my sons bday. Great price at $9.99. Well it was too good to be true. One disc for 4 movies, really? Maybe I got a bad copy but I was upset."
4,Dated,"This movie has excellent action and costumes, but it still has that early 90's pop culture dated look. Fifteen years later, I finally realize how annoying it is when any one of the turtles uses the word ""Cowabunga.""The movie's plot is simple, and it doesn't have bad words and things like that, so it's a really good movie for kids. I really love the new mutants Tokka and Razar. Real dumb strong monsters always make the movie for me. Shredder's a good villian as well, seeking a horrible revenge on the turtles at all costs, and destroying himself inside and out in the process.It's a shame David Warner's role as the TGRI scientist is so forgettable. If you want to see him at his best, watch the Star Trek Next Generation episode entitled ""Chain of Command: Part 2."" He really shines in that."
4,A Nostalgic Must-Have,"I got this for my brother as a gift. He grew up with these movies (well, the first three), and so I couldn't pass up the chance to get them for him. We have them on VHS, but since times are changing, I figured it would be smart to get him something on a more modern media. Plus, at the price it was at, how could I pass up getting 4 movies? The movies come in one case and were in great condition."
4,great deal,"Four movies on one disc is always a great deal. And when it comes to the cult classics of TMNT, how could anyone pass this by? I was pleased that it also included the newer film, especially since usually only the originals are found together. For fans of TMNT, this is a must have."
5,Am I the only one who thought this was cool???,"Well, it wasn't like the first one, a different person played April, and there was no Casey Jones (*sniff*). You also have to suffer through Ninja Rap by Vanilla Ice (Go nin-ja Go nin-ja Go!) But you have to admit, it was still pretty cool. You get to find out how the TMNT's got their names, there's a fighting asian pizza delivery guy named Keno (who appears to be an awesome fighter on-screen), and a nice new hideout. There are also some mutant beasts for the Turtles to defeat. And there is more pizza than ever. Don't let Vanilla Ice scare you - see this movie!"
3,You get what you pay for....,"The video quality is quite low for a dvd. Considering the price of $10, I can not complain too much."
3,not cartoon,i didn't realize this wasn't the cartoon version so it is a little outdated so i don't know if it was interesting to our 3 year old nephew.
1,The secret of the what?,"Terrible movie. Cheesy predictable, makes the first one that I thought was ok look really good. Not worth your time or money"
1,turtle dvd,"my 8 year old grandaughter was watching when 1 of the turtles said ""damn"" she was shocked and said grandama this is an adult cartoon"
1,The 4 Film Favorites version is a SCAM,"Despite claiming to contain four widescreen copies of this film, the first movie is a full-screen copy, even though the printing on the DVD says that it is widescreen.Only films 2-4 are actually in widescreen.This company is so utterly inept that they didn't even test their pressing before shipping out thousands of copies of this disc. Do not buy this version."
5,Awesome!!!,"I was worried that these would be really compressed videos all mashed onto one disc. For the price, that made sense. I was really pleased to open the (thin) package and find 4 individual discs inside for each movie! Great shows!"
2,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles turns up shmaga.,"In short, this film wasn't very good. What it lacked in cinematography it couldn't make up for, even with its incredible acting and beautiful script. In addition, the special effects teams and choreographers must have been practicing, because neither of these two areas impressed me. I don't suggest seeing this film, but buying it might be fun."
5,TMNT MOVIES AWESOME!!,TMNT movies are awesome and they all work great!! You don't get like behind scenes ETC but all movies play and look awesome.
5,Big Fan of the TMNT's,I love these guys and was a fan from the beginning when they first came out in the mid-80's. I took my kids to their live concert when they were so popular. So cool. Now my grandson watches them and loves them as well.
5,Great Movie,This was the best TMNT movie ever! I loved the first one but this one is a thousand times better! My advice is by both the first and second!
4,Very nice lamp,This is a very nice lamp. It's nice and heavy- well-made. I'm very happy with it. I think it's even nicer in person than it is in photos.
1,Awful quality...Worse customer service,"This headboad is really hard to put together because the cam/lock system it uses doesn't keep pieces together properly. It falls apart just by looking at it. I had to reinforce it with brackets just about everywhere. I had to ask for a replacement, and after battling over the phone, finally got the piece one and a half months later (Racks & Stands said they'd forgotten about me, they ""fixed"" their mess with a 10% credit). The pieces are made from cheap particle board, which desintegrates when you are trying to fit the pieces together. It looks pretty from the distance, but not worth the trouble or the money. I would buy solid wood next time and never from Racks and Stands again."
4,Very good unit.,"I hate heat. This little fan appears well made and delivers a nice breeze. It's fairly quiet. I'd like a little more breeze, but this will do. I don't know about battery life yet, but I use rechargeables so it's really not an issue. The neck strap is wide and comfortable. I was surprised at how just a slight breeze can make heat more tolerable."
3,"Okay, but not great","Convenient to carry around, reasonably quiet, but not very good as a fan, especially when used on a desk. USB power system is finicky, and sometimes the fan runs weaker attached to a computer than running on batteries."
2,blows hot air !!,"If the air outside is hot, then the fan blows out hot air! Only if the air is cold will the fan blow cold air.Because the fan lies on your chest, the air is only blowing on your chin (which can be annoying) and the breeze is only coming out of five square shaped holes at the top of the machine. It's better than nothing and if you try it and dont like it, the Sharper Image has a 60 day return policy."
5,Cliff,I really love this tv series. It is fun to seat and enjoy hours of this comic love relationship with police detective background. I recommend this set.
1,bad dvd,"I bought this for my husband, I also bought a new DVD player, it does not play on it or my old DVD playee"
5,Good writing plus good acting = great tv,Mr Fillion fits his character so well he's not so much acting as he is having fun in front of a camera. The writing and acting of even the bit characters in this series is top notch. If you are a Firefly fan you might even catch a few references thrown in a few episodes.
5,Funniest show on TV,The Castle series is one worth watching for the dialouge and the fatastic acting. Many have tried and few have succeeded in making a cop show both criminally interesting and witty at the same time. I love Castle because it breaks the monotony of the procedural cop shows and their almost maniacal aversion to being even the least bit humorous or entertaining. And Stana Katic is a babe.
5,"CASTLE, The Complete Second Season","In CASTLE, Nathan Fillion displays his great versatility as an actor. His character, mystery writer, Richard Castle, has a puckish sense of humor, a knack for putting his foot in his mouth and is a caring and loving father to his daughter, Alexis. He has a very unique way of solving crimes, sometimes annoying and exasperating NYPD Detective, Kate Beckett, who he's supposed to be observing/assisting. They struggle to work together, but Kate soon finds out that Castle has a brilliant mind when it comes to crime solving and, in spite of his procedural ineptness, he really does help her more than he hinders her. The supporting cast nicely balances out the he/she interaction and sexual tension between Castle and Beckett. The plots are well thought out and written. I can see why this show continues to be one of the best on TV."
5,Great movie from Amazon,I was pleased with the speed in which I received this movie. All the disks played with out any problems. I would buy from this vendor any time knowing the movies will arrive as advertised.
5,castle: the complete second season,"my wife & myself just started watching the current castle series this past season so we were interested in seeing how it all began. we purchased season 1 thru amazon & enjoyed it so much we purchased season 2 which we're in the process of watching.we enjoy the plot of a writer shadowing a police detective for his books. the inter-action of richard castle & kate beckett is wonderful. castle's mother & teenage daughter lives with him giving some entertaining subplots. the program is light,entertaining & well scripted. the characters are well suited to the parts.would recommend highly."
4,castle,Good show with well balanced cast. Started watching upon recommendation of my children and enjoyed it thoroughly. Will watch subsequent seasons
2,show freezes,It's no fun to watch a show that freezes up. I had to forward ahead and skip a scene to finish the show.
1,so,"Probably the worst show I've ever watched. Is Castle a trans-sexual? Is he happy in the midst of 15 women who continually deprecate his manhood? Berate his intelligence? Snide his maturity?Yep, he's a camper. And a fine liberal fellow, indeed."
1,Not pleased.,I adore this show and I went to watch it and it was great UNTIL I got to the 3 disc and it won't work. The episodes skip and won't work. There aren't any scratches but it won't work... I'm just going to have to end up buying a new season. It sucks.
4,Nathan Fillion fans and mystery fans will both love it,"I started watching Castle because I'm a huge Nathan Fillon fan, but I've really enjoyed the series. I've fallen in love with the characters, which is a rare thing for me and TV shows. The episodes are fun. I appreciate the occasional veiled Firefly reference, too."
4,A Good Year for Castle,"Shipping from Amazon was fairly quick as usual even though I use the free shipping option when possible. They don't usually penalize you for using it. The second season is my favorite, though the third season started out strong. It had it's ups and downs including the final."
5,Castle sec. season,"Even an order from Germany worked fine: very fast, good packed.I think I do not have to give a comment on the DVD itself: I reallylike it!"
5,One of the best programs on TV!!!!!,"I started by watching a few episodes and realized I had missed a lot in the story base and then of course went to Amazon and searched to see if there were earlier years of the program. I was thrilled to find there were 4 years before and so I ordered them all and now am waiting anxiously for the season 5 to ship. If you like mystery, stories about writers and romance you will LOVE this series!"
4,just because of her.,I love the show and that is why I ordered it to catch up on what I have missed. But for me he is not the show she is!
3,recording bad,"I love Castle, but the recording of this particur DVD was very bad. It had wavy lines on almost every session. I sent it back, received another one that was also bad. I returned that one for a refund. I still do NOT have the second season."
5,THE BEST !!!!,This show is THE BEST TV SERIES any of the networks have produced in the last 20 years. The Characters are SUPER and interactions between ALL GREAT !!!!! The writers of this show are very talented and keep you guessing. FANTASTIC !!!!!
4,castle: The complete second series,"I thought this second series was as good as the first, my only comment is why has the lead put on so much weight between series."
2,damaged,"All of the discs were in perfect condition except for the third disc. The review didn't say anything about a disc being damaged, so I paid $25 for a damaged disc, and I was not too happy when I found out because I couldn't return it because I opened it"
3,funny mystery,"I have not seen the show or DVD. Person that received as gift said its awesome. Has mystery, but is funny also. Thought it was a little pricey."
4,Very Sci Fi!,"I just bought the 2nd season of ""Castle"". I've only seen 1 of 4 DVD's but it's very good for those who love Science Fiction and I do most of the time. I loved the first season.I'm also a big fan of Henry Potter, so I'm seeing these Sci-Fi films from all sorts of unique ways. I really like ""Castle's"". It's for young adults and on up in age, those who are into letting their minds see what is presented by the director and freeing themselves to enjoy the unusal. I'm able to enjoy most everything that's not real just because it isn't. I loved all the ""Star War's"" and a near realistic ""2001"" and ""2010"". Most people will enjoy these movies."
2,Lost Interest,"The first season was cool. During the second season, I realized I was losing interest, all the plots were the same. Sorry, but I guess others feel this was a really good series. And I do too, but simply lost interest in Season 2 and won't see the rest. I guess this is why it never went on like other series for 6-10 years."
5,Best TV show,I have been addicted to this show since it debuted and season 2 is fabulous! We learn more about Castle as well as Beckett and of course...Nikki Heat. Humor with wit and mystery....fabulous!
5,Castle TV Series,"We own both of the available DVD seasons of the Castle TV series and will continue to add this show to our in-home library as long as the writers keep it clean. Castle is the name of the show's lead character (Rick Castle) who is a writer of mystery novels and a single father of one very bright teenage daughter. Through a friendship with the mayor he is allowed to follow a group of detectives on `real' murder cases as research for his new books. The lead detective (a sassy, in-your-face single woman) is the character, ""Nicky Heat"" for his new series of books. There is a slight attraction between them (of course) which gets things heated up on occasion, but so far you have to `fill in the blanks' yourself (smart on the writer's part). Castle keeps the detectives on their toes with his off-the-wall comments and surprisingly accurate case solving abilities. A must see."
5,Loved it.,"Does a good job of continuing the story from the first season and it's evident that the Castle/Beckett relationship will be an ongoing series of missed moments and opportunities. If you liked Season 1, then Season 2 is for you."
5,Charming,"The characters are all very likable. There's the whole will they won't they dynamic between Becket and Castle. It's all quite formulaic, but fun. So who cares?"
3,Lucy - part one,"Only 3 stars, because it does not deal in depth with Lucille's later work. A lot has been made available out the I LOVE LUCY era, but little about the 60s-80s. I hope someone brings out the complete LUCY SHOW, HERE'S LUCY, LIFE WITH LUCY on DVD (or VHS) in uncut remastered prints. Please."
3,"A fun read, if a little dated","Blood Walk is a compilation of Lee Killough's two Garreth Mikaelian novels Blood Hunt and Bloodlinks. The writing is straight to the point, no frills, the characters interesting, and the action just strong enough to carry the whole thing along. Not a bad airplane read. The references to various 80's-related paraphernalia made it an interesting ride into nostalgia land, though were I the editor of this edition, I would probably have had the author try to update the technology just a little bit. If you're looking for a quick no-nonsense Laurell K. Hamilton read, this is a great book for you, and a great alternative to the Anita Blake books. If you're looking for something deeper and more prosaic, stick to Anne Rice or the other up-and-coming gothic authors."
2,"boo this, man","I love the roots, and have seen them live several times. I think this album was a departure from what they do best - great beats and strong lyrical content. The quality of the voices was what made it great hip-hop, and this cd seems flat. I think there were too many collaborations and not enough of the roots true style. My favorites are still Do You Want More? and Things Fall Apart... I'd say if you loved those you'll be disappointed by this."
1,Phrenology,"This is a pretty wack cd. Compared to their other albums, it lacks those real ""stand-out"" tracks. They are getting moved out of the industry from all those flossin mc's, and even more concious mainstream mc's like Nas. I think The Roots need to do some ""destroying and rebuilding""."
3,It's Alright...could have been better...,"It's an okay CD, I'm glad I bought it, I'm just dissapointed bc I know how much better it could have been. There are only 13 songs on the album, 3 of which aren't really songs. The Nelly Furtado track is useless, you wouldn't be able to tell Nelly was on it unless the Roots told us she was. I think ""The Seed 2.0"" and ""Thought at work"" rock, the rest are ho-hum. I'm not a big fan of the Jill Scott track, they could have picked a better song to feature her, like the song she did with them on the [two dollar] bill MTV joint.The Roots have always been a live act band, trying to capture their magic in a studio has always been tough. (buy the roots live album, it's their best I think)."
2,Its OK,My first Roots CD. I bought it because I heard they had alot of deep messages. I wasn't expecting to focus on all the cussing (despite the disclaimer). Seems like its just another Rap cd which focus' on the wrong words and distracts you from the message.
5,Amazing album...,This is an amazing album. Everybody should get it (even if you haven't heard anything about the Roots before). You won't be disappoinded. Get it!
1,The Death of Hip-Hop,"The essence of Hip-Hop music is no longer. Real Hip-Hop music is officially extinct! The official declaration of this tragedy is evident in the release of this dreadful album. The Roots have betrayed real Hip-Hop fans with this CD. The Roots was our last hope, but we've been hood-winked. I was so upset when I listened to this album, that I went to bed crying profusely. The next morning I set the CD in a pot of boiling water so that it would whelp, never to be played again. The appeal of Roots was in their live instruments, but on their latest CD- Phrenology, there are just the typical synthetic tracks created by keyboards, synthesizers, and other high-tech .... Despite my former allegiance to Roots, I cannot recommend this CD."
2,this aint the roots....,i dunno what the roots is trying to do but this aint what DO YOU WANT MORE!?!?! or Things Fall Apart did for me. This album is straigt up garbage. I just gave em two stars cuz i respect ther oots.I highly respect the Roots but come on...?uestlove...Black Thought...yall can do better...and what the hell is up with number 3????
2,Study of The Brain...,I used to like this Roots album when it first came out but now going back trying to listen to it...it has lost its flair quickly. VERY quickly. I don't know what it is though...maybe it's the demo esque feel of the songs. The only songs I'm still feelin is Sacrifice and break You Off. They either feel incomplete or they feel like they run on forever. Or maybe it's just too many rock influences for my taste. Or maybe the rhymes on this album are sorta lacking. Maybe the Roots ARE just going through the motions. Whatever it is though it's causing me to despise this album. Stick with the other Roots albums for enjoyment and only get this cd to complete a collection (The bonus DVD was also a nice addition). That's the honest Truth.
2,Inexpensive rack,"Considering the price I wasn't expecting much. It says it is adjustable into 7 positions. Mine would only adjust into 6, of which only 1/2 of them would be useful. The construction is fine for the size of the rack. By its size if won't do for a very large roast. The only problem I had was that the paint came off in places after only one use. I would look elsewhere if you want a rack to be used everyday, but for occasional use it will be fine."
1,Paint Just Flakes Off,"I used this rack for roasting a whole chicken - usually at 325 degrees, so the oven is not usually that hot. The first use seemed to be OK, but after the second through fourth use, the paint started to peel off when I washed it (always washed it by hand). Now it's pretty bad and most of the paint has come off of the base and on parts of the bars. I decided to buy one of the silver ones from Amazon, so hopefully, that one will last. I just threw this black one out and can't recommend the black ones at all."
1,It will be rusty before long,The size and function of this rack are great. The black finish started coming off after the first use even though it was used and cleaned pretty gently. I am concerned about getting black paint on my food and the prospect of it starting to rust very quickly.
1,Terrible.,If I could give it negative stars I would.I used this rack twice. Once for a beef roast and once for a chicken. The teflon coating is already coming off.**PS I contacted the company about the problem and they sent a replacement non-teflon rack the same day. Their customer service is outstanding
4,Great business transaction.,"Elmo had a litlle problem when we got him, but the seller took care of it right away. It was a great business transaction and can not say enough of how great the seller was. I will definitely do business with them again."
2,Not what you think,"After months of my friends son saying all he wanted for x-mas was a huge elmo doll. I seen this item claiming to be a ""large"" 25"" doll i agreed on spending the 60 something dollars and get it. When he opened it my friend had said it was small and looked sick. All they did was extend his legs a few inches and his belly strunk. Needless to say i was highly disappointed and had to dish out 30 something more dollars for one that was alot bigger and cheaper. So if you think that your getting your moneys worth on this doll forget it. I suggest the ""large elmo soft plush doll"" by fisher price."
4,good book and very modern,"what i liked most in this book are the unique mgt challenges section and the mgt wrap-up section, plus the nice graphics and colors of the book. however, the book is very easy to understand and too simple thus making me wonder if i am learning the essentials as much as the mis majors do."
5,book review,This book came to me in great condition and the sender sent it extremely fast. The sender was kind and considerate and ensured that I recieved the book. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,nice wrapper but where's the meat ?,I'm using this book as part of a first year information systems course and find that it's just full of useless buzzwords. I have no doubt that both Kenneth and Jane Laudon are very smart in their field (they both hold Phd's) but like most books written by academics it suffers from a largely academic analysis of the IT industry. It looks like they have little or no experience of the REAL world. It shows.
4,Very good introduction to Managing an Information System,"This text book is a good starting place for managers to learn about information systems and how to implement them into their own companies. I bought this book for a class on information systems, and not only did I find the book very thorough, but the web site gives the readers a chance to understand what they read by providing outlines and brief quizzes. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about computer based information systems, or wants to stay up to date on current business practices."
2,Essentials of Management Information Systems,"This book is not just expensive, it contains enough misdirection and inaccuracy to make it difficult going. Add to this the extremely busy style and excesive use of graphics, and statements such as (paraphrase) ""Look at the diagram at the beginning of each chapter for the answer to all your questions.....""These diagrams are almost incomprehensible and don't attempt to show a logical flow."
3,"Maybe useful, just not to me.",I was forced to purchase this for an undergraduate class I took. I skimmed through it and alot of the information that was taught out of the book was and has been irrelevant to alot of what I do today. I just didn't find it a worthwhile read.
2,"Big Title, small book","This is yet another random catalog of pictures of naked women. The authors make no point other than to identify the photographer. Some of these pictures are good, some are bad, some are boring, most are utterly unimportant silly testimonials to the authors' pedestrian taste.It is what you should expect from a title that equates naked with nude.I'd also repeat that the ""Editorial Review"" seems to be about a different book."
1,NEVER RECIEVED THIS!,I never received this and they have done nothing to compensate me or express any type of condolence. I am VERY VERY UPSET..
3,Decent Read,"Pretty Informative read, kind of dry at times in my opinion but has a lot of good info. Gives you a good rundown on the places, dates, and a quick summary of the battles that the armored divisions were a part of. Like I said a little dry but a good book to add to your collection for reference."
3,Italian armor in N. Africa -- Iron Hulls Iron Hearts,"Disappointing -- the author dwells at some length on the courage of the Italian soldiers (which he establishes), but fails to address effectively the serious organizational shortcoming which put them in some totally untenable situations. Too many iterations of the same thing -- Italian tanks meet British tanks/artillery, and are destroyed. Would have benefited from a little more discussion of the Italian Army's organization, officer-enlisted relations, food/clothing/shelter issues (all of which compromise combat effectiveness)."
4,"Excellent newspaper, poor delivery","The newsmagazine is excellent for those wishing to say abreast of the crime scene in France. The quality of the writing is superb.The problem is the delivery of the product- it comes via surface mail - I presume by ship - and is always 4-6 weeks late. Its arrival is erratic. The magazine, which is published every 2 weeks, sometimes doesn't arrive for 6-8 weeks, then 2 or 3 may arrive together. This erratic delivery is very annoying. We would be willing to pay extra for the (presumably more timely and regular) air delivery offered by the magazine, but this is not offered by amazon's magazine service."
3,"Off the beaten track, pleasant but not that memorable","Sheldon Kasner (Rob LaBelle) is a nebbishy loan officer for Hebrew Loans Bank who embezzles $2 million of mobster money. He heads for a small town and joins the local Chevrah Kadisha -- the society that prepares bodies for burial according to traditional Jewish rituals -- with the plan to acquire a body and use it to fake his own death in order to take the mob off his trail. But Sheldon is charmed by the elder gents who run the society and grudgingly let him join, which that leads to even more trouble. This pseudo-noir/caper film, written and directed by Nicholas Racz in 2002, is cleanly made and decently acted, and the plot twists are solid, if not particularly memorable."
5,Going Native,"Tom Harmer catches the 'Spirit' of writing as well as that of a White ""Going Native"". This book inspired me on a very deep level, I came out of dreaming and into a whole new world. He writes with a clear and concise voice with descriptions of the wilderness of the Okanogan people and the familiarity of 'the wild man of timber'. The sweatlodge experiences and conversations with the elder, Tommy Clayton, are deep philosophical explorations that lead us back to ourselves and we say, ""Aaaa"". I was listening Tom Harmer and I have heard what you said. This book sets well among those of Carlos Casteneda and describes the Indian Way magnificently. One of my favorite books! Read it."
3,Squeaky Soles,"I love these shoes, they look great, are super comfortable and I get a lot of compliments on them. Unfortunately I had the same problem as the previous reviewer- a pesky and embarrassing squeaky sound. I tried about 5 different pairs of socks,thinking that might be the source of the problem. Then I tried taking out the insoles - That did the trick. My guess is that the shoes being made of recycled plastic materials is the source of the sound. I bought a new pair of insoles and they are great. I would give them five stars if I hadn't had to invest in a 8 dollar pair of insoles for the 25 dollar shoes. But maybe that's why the were 25 dollars in the first place."
4,Wonderful for all ages,"As are most Albert Payson Terhune books, this one is wonderful for readers of all ages! Laugh, cry and grow with these wonderful Collie dogs."
4,A good addition to my collection of organizing books,"I wouldn't recommend this as your main, basic housekeeping manual. However, if you've struggled with these issues forever, like I have, it's great for a new perspective.The author has a useful list of questions for prompting you to see your hangups and roadblocks. Also, her system of working around a room in sections goes a bit further than Sandra Felton's ""Mt. Vernon method."" She actually has you paint and decorate each section as you go, not just declutter and clean. It's a stroke of genius that I wish I'd thought of myself. I've been procrastinating big time about some painting projects because I couldn't face having a whole room torn apart at once. This one's a keeper, for me."
5,Sticks and Stones,"If you like the 77s, you will love this CD, If you have no clue who the 77s are, you will love this CD. Great music 80 music with a positive message. MAD"
4,creates a dilemma,"I used to own this album on CD, but it was stolen from my car along with several other rare out of print albums (like Dr. Edward Daniel Taylor's Miracle Faith Telethon, and Preachers From Outer Space) along with my car stereo and a goodly chunk of the dashboard. This leaves me with a terrible dilemma: is it a sin to want to punch someone out for stealing your Christian albums? I'm thinking yes.Anyway, it's actually a great album. Great guitar work on songs like ""Don't, This Way"", and the best version of ""Do It For Love"" there is (and they've done several). ""Perfect Blues"" isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece, but it's a pretty good song, and fun to listen to. Some pretty good stuff. Even though I lost the album several years ago, sometimes when I see Orion in the night sky, the words ""Orion's belt is shining / The Big Dipper'supside-down"" go through my head -- ""Nowhere Else"" is a pretty darn good love song."
3,The transcendent power of love,"The childhood of many of us could be described as less than perfect. What we do with it is of the essence. Evangeline Anna Kurr-Goss has the courage to express her journey to adulthood and her own parenthood. She chronicles her childhood with all its ups and downs, recaling those who helped her along the way, and the lessons she learned from them.It's the honesty that's most affecting in this small book, the desire to see clearly, and love despite the face of reality."
5,Every person who chooses to do good should have a voice,This person strikes me as being honest and forthright. I believe she needs our support. Let's invest a little in the future of children. Let's buy the book..
2,Toshiba 26DF56 Widescreen ?,"Yep sure is a widescreen crt ! What they do not tell you is on wide screen you loose about 3/4"" top and bottom blacked out! Also remote can't be used in a dry house condition as it has to be reprogammed very often something to do with capicitors in remote! Was better off zooming my dvd player on my 27' JVC ! Picture is good on this model though !"
3,"Toshiba 26"" TV",The only thing I don't like is when changing channels it's takes to long for the picture to come up
3,Router stand,"It works as it should, I bolted a router table on top of it. The only issue the rubber feet keep falling off when I move the stand/table around. A minor nuisance."
4,Helpful historical analysis of a Mexican revolutionary.,"Articulate, specific summary of the actions of Ricardo Flores Magon and his brother during, before and after the Mexican Revolution. Also traces the activities of the PLM (Partido Liberal Mexico) and IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), my only criticism is the lack of actual writing by Magon, of which there are only really 10 pages, so you get a lot of history, but not a lot of justification for his and his organizations' actions during that time.Solidarity and revolution."
5,A must have!,"I couldn't tell at times whether I should laugh or cry, or both at the same time. Many of the stories were enchanting, endearing, all stories I would like to have written myself. L.M. Montgomery is a fantastic writer for all times."
4,Pretty Good!,"I adore the Anne of Green Gables Series and was looking for something else by LM Montgomery. I found this and the first Chronicles of Avonlea for my Kindle. I enjoyed reading these two, but missed ""Anne"" in the books. Anyway, yes, this is worth your time."
2,Typical L.M. Montgomery short stories,"I would recommend giving this volume a miss, if only to avoid reading the embarrassingly racist closing story, ""Tannis Of The Flats"", and being rudely reminded of an unsavory side that exists to some of our fondly idealized images of the past as filtered through the Anne series. Even without that, however, none of these tales are very good (though some of the light-hearted ones, like ""Aunt Cynthia's Persian Cat"" are kind of fun); the melodramatic ones are often downright wretched. And, as with the first CHRONICLES, Anne appears only briefly."
2,"Sweet, but disappointed end...",Most of the stories are more sweet short stories from Avonlea. But I was a little stunned by the last story and the racism in it. I think I was just shocked and saddened to encounter it in one a book of my favorite authors - and I think it says a lot about the attitude of many people of that time toward those who were not white.
1,the stories have aged poorly,"The Anne books were among my favorites growing up, and I thought it would be fun to re-read them. Boy, was I wrong! ""Aunt Cynthia's Persian Cat"" and ""The Materializing of Cecil"" were both cute, and ""The Brother who Failed"" had a nice end, but the morals of 1920 are more than a little disturbing now. In ""The Education of Betty"" a man marries his high school sweetheart's daughter, whom he helped raise from childhood, and in ""In Her Selfless Mood"" we are expected to sympathize with a woman who throws her life away on her no-account brother. And the less said of the **appallingly** racist ""Tannis of the Flats"" the better. The stories that are not embarrassingly outdated are sappy little romances. The Little House books retain their charm in a way Avonlea has not. I will not be sharing these chronicles with my children."
1,Poor quality that is not built to last,"We purchased two of these Danze towel racks, a matching towel ring and a toilet paper holder three years ago. They have not stood the test of time. One of the towel rack's arms just snapped off under the normal weight of a towel. The finish on the toilet paper holder has worn off. I regret purchasing Danze products and now I'm replacing them."
3,Mixed feelings,"I got this video as part of a workout routine I have created for myself. I love to dance. I appreciate the dance segments of this video, but I have realized it is more of a documentary. I have to make the most of it, since I spent my money. I like the dances and I am happy with it from that aspect."
1,Not what I was looking for,I wanted something where the girls teach you how to roll. This instruction was more for video dancers.
5,RE: It's all about dancing,"Dis DVD is wicked yo.... a bit short though but wat they do ave is good. wicked tunes and all the latest moves fi da dancehall..Arrived quick, packaging was a bit extreme, so it didnt fit through the letter box, had to collect from postal office.."
2,It's All About Dancing: Jamaican Dancehall Style,"If you're trying to learn the latest Jamaican dance moves, you may enjoy this video. I actually thought the video would show dancehall scenes, but it really did not, it was more like an instructional video, with armature dancers and lousy music."
2,"Good dancers, boring moves, can't understand the accent","I agree with ""Just Another Girl's"" 2/2007 reviewIt was hard to hear them, most of it was a documentary, though you can watch only the dance part. It takes place on a beach with a DJ, the titles block the feet & the dances were all boring to see though obviously easy to do. The moves are: ""part the crowd"", ""swing song"", ""nature dances"". ""step away"", ""air force one"", ""and one"", ""Santa Bounce, ""Badda Dance.""If you want more complicated dance moves & better teaching, try ""How Fi Dance Reggae"" it blows this one away.You can see clips of this on youtube & the other title as well."
3,Good but should have been better,"Overall the book was good but reading it 7 years after publication,I was somewhat disapointed. Would not have read if I would haverealized when it was written.The author needs to update the book and for me, analyze more ofthe American car companies, good and bad."
2,Too much opinion interjected amongst fact,"While there are some interesting stories about the various car companies, the author adds her own opinion in far too many situations. Her prediction of the automotive landscape in 2010 in particular displays a lack of understanding of the financial aspects of the industry. There are better books out there."
3,Not the best for research papers,"The End of Detroit looks like a great book with a lot of great information. As a source for a research paper, however, its layout isn't helpful. Cryptic chapter titles and a lack of sections or section headings mean that one must, in essence, read the entire book to obtain valuable contextual information.Bottom line - it's written more like a novel than a documentary. I don't have the time to appreciate that."
2,Disappointing,"Others have already noted the various factual errors and sweeping generalizations. The thing that really irked me about this book is that its title leads you to believe that most of the reading will be about the US car industry....in fact, you read chapter after chapter about imports, with references to how Detroit compares to the imports.One whole chapter on Camry, one whole chapter on Hyundai/BMW, one whole chapter on the ENTIRE history of Toyota & Honda, etc. gets pretty boring, as I really could do without a complete history lesson of the major import manufacturers. The book should have focused on what has been going on at the Big Three (decisions made, models produced, sales info, market trends, quality/reliability) and how consumer preferences have led to the imports' increased market share in the US......There was just too much emphasis on specific imports with too little relevant content as pertains to the title of the book."
4,"Cool book, needs an update","This was a really cool book that gives a good overview of how the Imports took over the Auto industry. The biggest issue is that the last update of the book was in Nov 2004 so there is almost 5 years that isnt covered. This should be revised asap since the book talks about this and that will happen by 2010, etc and it turned out to be fairly prophetic. Maybe just an update to the epilogue."
4,Good book for people who are interested but not experts,"This is a very good book for an overview of the state of the automotive business world. Note if you are a total gear head, work in one of these companies, etc.. this book will probably not be of interest to you as it doesn't ever go that deep.I especially enjoyed reading about Hyundai (the make of my own car), as well as BMW. Also enjoyable in the book is it's interesting descriptions of the automotive factories in the south (foreign makes). I've always thought the whole buy American notion was silly given that cars are made here anyways and this book only reaffirmed that believe for me."
4,Better than I expected,"I wasn't expected to much from this book but it was very balanced in what it had to say.It's all based on sound facts and figures the author has taken from the recent past as well as the not so recent 50's,60's,70's and 80's. The hardcore made-in-USA crowd may not want to read it or they'll refuse to acknowledge it,but it's very difficult not to come to the conclusion that the author hints at. The big three have talked the talk for too long while their products don't walk the walk.Serious car buyers are in many cases shunning Detroit products and it's getting worse, not better."
5,The Book I Was Waiting For,"I bought this book because I wondered why everybody I knew owned a Toyota or a Honda. I found it to be a very fast, very enjoyable read, perfect for a long plane trip. I particularly enjoyed the story of the Honda Odyssey minivan. And I also was interested to read aout the development of hybrid cars, since I'm thinking about buying one. This is actually less of a business book and more of a public policy or history book. People who are interested in the auto industry will enjoy it, but so will people who just what to know what happened to a very important industry. I'm also glad to see a woman writing about the car industry!"
2,"No ""End"" In Sight","Despite the sensationalistic title, I was hopeful that Ms. Maynard's book would be an insightful and balanced look at the American automobile industry. Sadly, her prejudices become obvious early on and prevent this book from being an objective study of the volatile subject. Ms. Maynard's blind infatuation with import car makers and her recital of every cliche about Detroit (""arrogant,"" etc.), along with a very subjective interpretation of statistics, make this a book that can only be recommended to someone who needs to assuage their guilt over buying that import mini-van or sedan. The ""end"" of Detroit? Just because Ms. Maynard writes it, doesn't make it so."
1,A RIP OFF OF A REAL BOOK,"This book is a wanna be ripp off of a great book called ""COMEBACK"". This woman has got to go back to high school Comp101 and learn to check her sources, or take up truck driving.Then she would be driving american wouldn't she?"
3,Thanks for the wake up call,"As a marketing executive for one of the big three, I couldn't help buying Maynard's book. As others have commented, Ms. Maynard's work does demonstrate her rather limited understanding of the automobile business in general and marketing in particular. She makes no attempt to conceal, her anti-domestic bias. Having said that, I agree with her main premise: U.S. auto firms are stuck in the ""boiling frog syndrome"". The facts speak for themselves and customers are voting with their dollars as Toyota and Honda quietly take our market one customer at a time. Hopefully, Maynard's book with all its warts will be a must read for all of us in Detroit and serve as a wake up call. Understanding the customer and establishing an emotional connection with him/her is what made Toyota and Honda brands strong. Hopefully we'll figure it out pretty soon."
4,Organised Chaos (bootleg),"This album is good, it's Waysted, enough said actually, but the sound quality sounds like its on the bootleg or sound board side of things, but still recommended if you're a fan."
4,Owned shortly but a proud owner,"I bought this hat to go to Thailand. It was working great - easy to pack, provides great sun protection and the inner sweatband sure can absorb a lot of sweat. Sadly, several days into my Thailand vacation, I forgot it in the cab and didn't realize it until it was too late. I was glad that I forgot to use the pocket on the flap to store cash though, otherwise I would've been out some money as well. Still, an awesome hat! The only thing that stops me from giving this product 5-stars was the fact that it didn't have some kind of chin strap, just in case I encounter some winds on my travels. Also, if there was a chin strap available, I would have just slung the hat onto my back and have it dangle from my neck instead of taking the hat off completely when not using it (I wouldn't have forgotten about my hat in the cab if this was the case !_!). Overall, great product still. I will probably buy this hat again when winter ends."
2,"First impression is good, but in the long run it's not a good product.","This review is for the Kroo case only, not including the other accessories. I bought this more than a year ago when I bought my Sansa player. At first I really liked it. It's as pictured, attractive, sturdy and seemed to be to doing a good job of protecting my Sansa. Then I flew somewhere and took it out of the case, to put it in my shirt pocket, and found that the cover had been scratching the front of my player from top to bottom. I had put it in the Kroo case when I received it, and left it there for about 2 months. In only two months it made my two month old MP3 player looking like something I must have had for years. I'd have been better off just tossing it in my purse like I do my cell phone, it's older than the Sansa and less scratched. In addition, the pink looked dingy fairly quickly. Look elsewhere for a case if you really want to protect your Sansa."
4,Dependable retailer,"Exactly as described. Quick delivery. Still haven't cracked it yet... I don't have anything more to say. Regardless, the review system wants more words. There aren't any more."
2,Not bad,I have not bought Hornes other books because I just find her pop image and style a bit twee .This one is more interesting and presents quite a few viewpoints so isnt bad for a quick read .Can entertain you if you want some pagan news bits but dont get it if you are seeking new ideas
3,good book for general interest,"I have never been a fan of Ms horne's books on witchcraft as frankly,I see them as non original pop culture marketing items.However,I enjoyed the scope of this compilation on paganisim and different exponents of the ideas as well"
2,A hodge podge of infomation,This book is okay if you like general info but I am afraid I like books on the craft to really stimulate me .I dont mind some of Ms hornes other books although her comments on satanism in her first book I personally dont agree with as I do not believe in looking his way at all .I found this to be alright if you are a beginner but not advanced and wont be buying it .
2,Colorforms don't stick,This is so cute! Lots of colorforms but right away after starting to play with they stopped sticking and were abandoned for a different toy. Waste of money.
5,A five stars class book,"Origin of humankind is a great book. It tells people about evolution of humankind from its very beginning approximately 2 millions years ago. It covers many aspect from anatomy, biology, social, psychology, etc. So, in my opinion this book is quite enlightening for layman such I am."
4,popover pan,"Very nice, doesn't stick, certainly a lot better than attempting popovers in a muffin pan. But I have another one with nice handles on it and slightly deeper compartments that I like a tad better."
4,Great Popovers,This pan is great. I make gluten free popovers/yorkshire puddings and they come up a treat. Much better than using a muffin pan. The Nordic Ware range is a wonderful product.
3,cool timely movie,"this is a film that hardly got any buzz, but if you get a moment it should be checked out. it speaks about Race and how it is reflected within Black folks in this film when it comes to Dollars&Cents. it makes you think, there is comedy involved, but at the heart of the matter is a Message to wake up&know your past in order to understand the present&lead to the future."
3,Shaking it over here boss!!!!,This movie was cool. it had its messages and has some good comedic moments.
3,Sectioned out,"Recruited to a top secret military organization after a botched rescue attempt in the Philipines, Major Vaugn finds himself coming to terms with life in general, and everything he thought he was fighting for is now called into question. There is much in fighting within his new group, and old members simply ""retired"".The action parts in this book are few, and far between, and you get the feeling half way through, that this is simply the beginning of a new military series on the war on terror.My suggestion: read instead; Mack Maloney's Strike Force series, much better books about the war on terror, and how it should be fought. Same Plot, much better books!"
5,"Interesting history, light in science","The book is basically made up of two parts: an historic overview of how time came to be measured the way it is (why there are 60 seconds in a minute, 12 months in a year, etc.); and a more esoteric discussion of the essence of time. The historic information was fascinating and was exactly what I had hoped for. I did not read this book hoping to get an in-depth scientific analysis of the dimension of Time (there are tons of other books out there to address that need) and thought the level at which that subject was covered was appropriate for this books intended audience."
1,Very sad.,"The parts of this book that deal with history are fairly interesting. Once the author starts detailing his ""theories"" of Time, Space and Infinity it becomes rather sad. Very much in the manner of those pathetic individuals who spent theirs lives trying to build a perpetual motion machine, prove the world is flat or turn base metal into gold.For anyone interested in mathematics, space and infinity I would recommend:One Two Three . . .Infinity, George GamowNumber Theory and its History, Oystein OreFeynman Lectures on Physics, Richard P. Feynman"
2,Credibility,"This is so obviously a book written by a non-scientist masquerading as a scientist. While a different viewpoint may be refreshing, I found his constant focussing on the personal details of astronomers and others (e.g. the references to Kepler as ""smelly"" - I have never heard this before) suggestive of a sneering agenda.While the book is, in parts, entertaining and informative, I cannot trust anyone who says ""speed and acceleration are the same thing"". This sort of tosh totally destroys the credibility of the author."
5,Daniell's on a Mission!,"Rosemary Daniell is on a mission, and part of her mission is to make sure that women in particular, but men as well fight and slay their ""demons/issues"" and get on with the life they were meant to have. Her dedication has led her to a 24-year love affair with Zona Rosa and to the brave souls who seek to break past their pasts, their fears, their excuses and live a full and authentic life. This book may claim to be ""about"" writing, but it's a lot more than a how-to book. The exorcises alone are worth the price. And by all means, if you can get to a Zona Rosa meeting--go! You're in for a treat."
2,black? should i send it back?,the black ink does not seems to want to work. i've been fighting with it for the past few days. i have yet to try the other colors. i have noticed the cartridges of the original brother black and this black look different. there is only one hole in this new black at the bottom. all the other colors match my original cartidges except for the black ink.
2,Not our favorite Dora DVD....,"My daughter has more Dora DVD's than I would care to admit. This one is not her favorite. As a matter of fact she never requests it. Come to think of it, it's not my favorite either.I much prefer Dora's Rhymes & Riddles or Map Adventures to this one...."
3,Love Dora but....,This DVD does not automatically go onto the next movie. I dont get it. Most parents only get these things to occupuy the lil ones while we are busy. But its only 23min and then I have to return to dvd player :(
4,QUICK TO FIX THE ISSUE,HAD A SLIGHT PROBLEM BUT WERE VERY QUICK TO FIX IT WOULD SHOP WITH THEM AGAIN
1,Don't be fooled by name,"As many others have said, the steering bar doesn't work properly and the bike is WAY too tippy - two things you do not want in a tricycle. We gave ours away after our older daughter outgrew (and never used) ours and are shopping for a different one for our younger girl. Stay away."
5,We love this bike!,"This is our daughter's first bike and she loves it! We really love the safety features like the seat belt and adult steering handle. My husband is 6'3"" and the steering handle comes up to a comfortable height for him to maneuver. We've had the bike for about 3 months and it seems to be holding up well. What a great investment!"
2,Steer & Stroll Trike is Big Mistake!,I purchased the Steer & Stroll Trike by Radio Flyer as a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter because I thought I was buying a good quality item for her. The steering mechanism was faulty and broke within a few days. The trike was returned to the store where the display Steer and Stroll Trike was faulty as well. The store refused to give a refund--just another trike. I wish I had never bought this!!!!!!!!!
2,wishing we had bought something else,"This tricycle was a lot of fun during the phase where we pushed my daughter around on it, but now that she is trying to pedal herself.....she tips over ALL the time. If she just leans over to look at something...it tips. Or if she turns the steering...it tips. She is sooo frustrated that she can't ride it. I didn't realize just how bad this trike was, until she hopped right on my nephew's bike and took off like a pro...never tipping over! All this time , it has been her trike and not her lack of control. It appears to us that there is a poor center of gravity based on the design of the bike. We are currently shopping for something else."
1,Parent steering not working from the start,"I bought this trike b/c it had the features of most higher end trikes. I should have read these reviews better b/c we had the same problems. No matter what we did to the cables, the steering for the parent would not work. The one time we got it to work, you had to have the handle way to the left to get it to turn the wheel both ways. I am glad that we figured this out before my son started even riding it b/c it is promptly going back to the store. You would think you would get more for 50 bucks. I am very disappointed in Radio Flyer and doubt I will ever buy from them again."
1,Garbage,"This broke after a few months of very light use. After being outside in the rain once, the front wheel/pedals were not functioning properly. No seatbelt, plastic tires. We were really disappointed but ended up getting a schwinn trike for our sons second birthday which was 100 times better."
2,Axel detaches from wheel,"I purchased this bike based on all the positive reviews. We assembled it without much difficulty but were surprised by how the axel fit over the wheel. It is plastic that you tighten with hands/wrench, but there is no part that overlays and actually seals the connection. Subsequently, after one ride, the axel began detaching from the wheel every 50 ft. Clearly, not optimal. We returned the bike, unfortunately."
2,Can wake the dead!,"This trike has a lot of great features. The freewheeling pedals, the parent steering, event the built in handle on the seat. One feature I could do without is that the things squeals so loud that it will give anyone a headache within 5 minutes. I tried everything I could think of to stop the earsplitting shrieking, but even an quart of oil couldn't help it. I might be able to fix it if I could take the wheels off, but they are attached in such a way that they can not be removed without breaking them. No nuts or bolts on these low cost items. We got it for our daughter for Christmass, but I think we are going to have to replace it with something else soon. Too bad, because other than the noise it is a good product for the price."
2,"Defective, Had to Return","We thought that this would be a great trike for your little one to learn on. Unfortunately after only two uses, the parent steering mechanism started to malfunction, leaving a lot of play (wiggle room) in the controls. The outcome of that was us having to swerve and weave all over the place to keep from going off of the curb. He almost tipped over quite a few times because it was like we were trying to dodge and weave cones or something! We contacted Amazon to return it, and they took it back despite it being a gift, and it being a week outside of the 30 day return policy. Great job Amazon for standing behind their products!"
4,Good bike for Toddler,"I got this bike for my son for his 2nd birthday. Despite the other reviews, we like the bike. We had it installed at the store for $10. and that was worth it. The parent steering works fine, even though it is a little loose. My son doesn't know how to pedal yet, but he likes to put his feet on the petals, which doesn't stop the wheel like a traditional tricycle would. My son also likes to push the bike himself with the handle. It is worth the money."
1,Radio Flyer Steer and Stroll Trike,"My son received this tricyle for his 1st birthday. It was difficult to put together and as excited as he was to ride it, we were only able to take it out a couple of times. The parent handle on the back was difficult to steer and after the first use it started to break, but the third time it was completely useless. Tips very easily. Expected a better product than this from Radio Flyer, especially for $50."
1,unsafe at any speed,This trike looked so cute in the store but has been a huge dissapointment. It started to rust only a few weeks after we bought it and more importantly it is very unstable. I would not be surprised if it eventually gets recalled. Do not buy!
1,"Assembly parts, nuts & bolt s won't fit.","Assembly parts, nuts & bolt s won't fit. my son was excited to get on this. However spend atleast couple fo hours trying to put this together most of the nuts & bolts were not aligning well. had to return"
1,Broken,"Like other reviewers have noted already, the pedals are broke and no longer turn the wheel. That's a lot of money for a bike that doesn't pedal."
3,Steer and Stroll Trike,This item was purchased as a gift for my son. I believe that the age range for this bike is a little too young. I put him on it right after he turned a year and he could barely hold on. There are no straps to secure your child in for safety. So I would only recommend this for an older child that is just learning how to rid a trike.May 3 or 4.
3,Too big,"It took us an hour to assemble the trikes and the job was challenging.My twin boys are 23 months old. They loved the Radio Flyer cars, but don't love these trikes.They get in them for about 10 minutes and then want to get out.I wish the trike was a little smaller so that my kids can comfortably reach the pedals.It is helpful that it has a handle, but trikes with handles should be adjustable for smaller kids to be able to pedal so that they get some exercise, otherwise it seems that we can't use the ""trike"" feature and it becomes the same as my other Radio Flyer car for the kids, except the car is a lot more fun. I was hoping they would be able to learn to bike in these.Overall the trikes are ok."
5,Big hit at the party,"We bought this trike for our 2 yr. old grandson. He really loves it! It makes him feel like a ""big"" boy. He's a little short yet to peddle, but it's a great introduction to doing it on his own. It's great on the one that is doing the training as there is no bending at your back. The little bell on it is a cute little added feature as well as the the little storage unit in the back. We bought one for our other grandson a year ago and he loves it as well. Big hit at the Birthday Party!"
3,Son Loves it,My son loves this tricycle. It is sturdy and rides smoothly. I had to apply WD40 one time to its tires to stop the squesking but that is nothing to complain about. We were unable to affix the parent handle bar so that feature hasnt been used. I would recommend it.
3,disapointed!,steering mechanism is faulty. It tips over very easily. Don't forget your protective gear when riding. The push bar is okay. I expected more from radio flyer.
2,One more thing,"I see the age range is up to 5 years old? Are they kidding me? What 5 year old would fit on this thing? My son is 3.5 and granted, is tall for his age-but still! I couldn't see any child older than 4 being able to use this!"
1,Perfect if you want to add more junk to our landfills,"Real owner here, not some PR rep for radio flyer and the truth as our family has experienced it with the ""new and improved"" model 53s is that they are un-usable. What a shame that we have to add to the landfill and now spend more money just so we can try and enjoy a stroll around the city with our toddlers. We have two for our two toddlers and both are so loud with constant ear-piercing squeaks that we've finally given up. So loud they are headache inducing and an embarrassment to be ""heard"" going down the streets with. Thanks Radio flyer for showing us just how little money gets you these days. Had we known such we would have spent more and actually gotten something we could use."
1,Jeers to Radio Flyer for putting their name on this trike!,"I can't begin to explain how frustrated and angry I am at Radio Flyer for putting out such a piece of junk with their name on it. The frame seems sturdy enough, but the plastic is flimsy; the plastic housing for the push bar broke the FIRST day of use. We were never rough with this trike, but after a few more weeks of use, the parent steering mechanism broke and it could only turn left or go straight. A couple months later, the plastic housing holding the fork/front wheel to the body of the trike broke, so the tricycle was basically in two pieces, and it happened while my daughter was riding it! This was not a cheap tricycle, but the quality is TERRIBLE. Too bad I didn't read the reviews from other consumers who had the same trouble first (and there are many). It's a shame that Radio Flyer decided to risk their previous wonderful reputation by selling this tricycle. I don't think I'll buy Radio Flyer again."
3,Needs improvement.,"We bought it and returned it.- The footrest is in the worst spot. My son didn't use it because it was soo far back.- The pedals spin in the backwards movement to allow parents to push it. But when a toddler rides it alone. The only way to stop is to drag feet.- The headtube has to be constantly tightened.- The plastic type wheels are loud on the concrete.- The Steering arm is very loose and hard to control.Good- It looks cool, and my son liked the bag in the back. Thats about it.We ended up getting the Huffy Canopy Trike, which we've had for a week and love! It's a LOT more durable too."
3,Cute but poor quality,"We bought this tricycle for my daughter when she was just short of a year old. The steering feature worked fine, aside from the incredibly loud squealing noise the tricycle started to make when pushed, after about 6 months of occasional use. Now, however, she is old enough to start riding it on her own - and the pedals don't work. The pedals move, but they don't engage the wheel, so that no matter how hard she pedals, the bike goes nowhere. What a disappointing piece of junk!An update: I'm upgrading my overall review somewhat, as the quality issue has been mitigated by some excellent customer service. I called Radio Flyer's customer service about the problem, and they are shipping me a new front wheel free of charge."
4,Not bad,"I bought this bike for my son's 2nd birthday and was concerned that since he is small he would not reach the pedals,he did, the seat has 3 adjustable positions so it will grow with him. My son loves it! The fact that he can rest his feet on the pedals without them moving while I push is great. I read the manufactures review comment and made sure to get this model because the previous model had steering issues, steering still is not effortless, there is a lot of play. I am able to steer and the handle bars move so it is teaching my son to steer. Quality seems good and assembly was nothing major. I have already recommended it to a friend."
1,Cheap Crap,"We have model #53 (supposedly improved) and WOW is it poorly made. The front wheel fell off while my son was riding it (no injuries -- but, seriously, ?????!). Even after ""fixing it"" the handle bars wiggle front to back more than 1cm. We consulted an experienced bike tech who admitted to having junked more than 1 of these for similar reasons. It's ridiculous how cheap this trike is. Shoddy crap. Nostalgia aside, I wish we'd bought a Kettler and saved the trouble..."
1,Tips over & poor quality!,"This tricycle is such a disappointment. It has broken or worn in several areas, for example despite repeated tightenings, the handle bars do not stay true and turn the wheel as they should. It also tips over WAY to easily- just asking for an injury. I would not recommend this to anybody."
1,Very disappointed in this trike,"We have been extremely disappointed with this trike. It was not cheap, but we thought it would grow with our boy thru the years. My biggest complaint is that it is very unsturdy. With the handle on it was bad enough, but once we took the handle off, I can't tell you how many times my son has tipped over.This product should be recalled before someone really gets hurt. It is in our trash."
3,"fun, until it broke","i believe it was the 5th use of this trike by my 2 year old when the steering handle broke. Its a metal bar stuck into a cheap plastic gearbox that cracked after minimimal use. Why did they not use metal? Good question, since you are steering a 10 pound trike with a 30lb kid on it. I exchanged it for another, but expect that one to break too, although she's only used it once. After that, i will buy a real tricycle made of metal instead thin cheap plastic parts. This trike was fun for her, and a good concept, however made out of cheap crap."
3,No Brakes,This bike was great until my son got big enough to ride it himself. It is not safe to have him ride it without me holding on because there is no way for him to brake. I can't risk him rolling into the road with this bike so I am currently looking for a new one :(
4,Fun for toddler,My son loves it and it's quite good for little boy to exercies. Plus parents can easily control the direction when toddlers having fun outside the home.
3,"After a ""test-drive"", we decided not to buy it","My 14 month old son recently had the opportunity to ""test-drive"" his 25-month old friend's Radio Flyer trike. Though it looks great and my son LOVED riding it (we pried him away from it after 1/2 of riding), we will definitely not buy it; the squeak was AWFUL! Though it's possible the squeak could be corrected with some WD40, the bike in question was less than two months old and is hardly ever used - it really shouldn't be squeaking like that. Further, though the bike looked great and there is no doubt my son would love it, it did not seem sturdy enough to stand up to him for long. Good idea, nice looking, but poorly crafted.p.s. if you do decide to buy it, spring for the long handle - I was happy to have it when I pushed my son around for 1/2 hour."
3,It's OK -- kind of flimsy but gets the job done,"This trike is OK. We had a problem putting it together and had to go to Home Depot to get a replacement bolt. (One of the bolts included with the trike wasn't long enough to put the nut on. Lesson learned: Don't try to put together a toy the night before Christmas -- no one's in Customer Service to help.) We've also had to go back to replace another bolt when that nut fell off. The tires are plastic or something similar, rather than durable, more quiet rubber tires. It tends to be noisy, so we have to get out the WD-40 and play ""find the squeaky part"" now and then."
2,"The co-pilot feature is good, but...","It's nice that the co-pilot feature allows us to steer the trike, but there are a couple of serious problems. First and foremost, this trike tips over every easily. Second, the wheels started squeaking after a few days. I contacted the customer service about the second problem, but they were not very helpful. I was told to ""lube"" it; so, I did, but the squeaking noise comes back in the matter of minutes. It's a pretty loud and annoying; so, it virtually makes it impossible for my son to ride the trike. I would not recommend this product to my friends."
2,Horrible Quality,"We were really excited about this purchase for our 18 mth old son. Unfortunately, the steering for the parent-attachment failed to work after only a few months. Even the nuts and bolts came undone while we had taken a stroll in the neighborhood. Now the pedals will turn but they don't actually move the wheels and the steering for the kids handlebars don't work either. It was a great idea, but a waste of money."
2,Grinding Freewheel,"We were happy with the trike overall despite the reviews that stated problems with the push bar. However we were disappointed to find an annoying problem with this trike: the front wheel made a loud grinding sound when we pushed our child on the trike. We contacted Radio Flyer and they generously sent us a replacement wheel, but sadly the replacement wheel did the same thing. We felt it best to return the trike and make another purchase."
2,"Good concept, very poor pre-assembly, and poor steering colu","I would NOT buy this product. I wish I read the reviews before going to Toys r Us. The steering column was an absolute nightmare. I had to disassemble it completely (including the pre-assembled parts) and re-align it by hand. In the end, the parent steering column functioned, but poorly."
1,Disappointed mom,"I purchased this bike for my daughter's second birthday and it ended up being a total disappointment. It seemed to have several fatal flaws: 1) putting it together was a drag, 2) the parent steering handle did not allow sufficient control to direct the bike and did not seem to reliably override any handle bar steering, 3) the wheel base seemed too narrow to provide a sturdy ride and my daughter tipped over two times when we took it out for the first spin, 3) to top it all off, one of the pedals kept popping off. Needless to say after 2 hours with it I returned it and purchased another bike."
2,fun but the bell poses a laceration hazard,"My son sliced his pinky finger open on the bell's metal edge, practically butterfly-ing the whole pad of his finger off. We ended up in the ER where they had to glue his finger back together (stitches wouldn't work because the cut was in the crease of his finger).If you buy this trike, consider removing the bell. When I ran my finger over the metal edge of the bell, it didn't seem that sharp to me, but little ones' skin is not so tough and it sliced through his finger like it was butter."
2,Liked it and then stopped liking it,"I read the other reviews about not being able to assemble it or parts not working correctly and I haven't had any of those problems. It has worked as advertised for our child so we have like it but now, we are disappointed. Our son has outbrown the need to have a parent steer it for him so we removed the parent steering to allow him to do on his own and guess what? It has no brakes. We live in a hilly neighborhood so there is only two ways to stop...hit something or put your feet down. He likes riding it but can only do so in our garage since our driveway is on a slope. So overall I would say that it is a good attempt but not to great of a product. I went to the store today and bought a different one that he can ride on walks with us in the neigborhood that has brakes....so this one was a waste of money."
1,NOT what I expected,"I really thought this was the perfect tricycle for my 3 year old. I was sorely mistake. The steering does not work one bit, which was disappointing because that was the main reason I bought it. It is top heavy and my daughter tipped several times thankfully I was standing right beside her and was able to catch her before she fell. Also, the pedaling sticks. I thought my daughter just didn't grasp the concept of pedaling. Then our neighbors daughter got on it and she had the same issues as my daughter. This is a little girl that avidly rides her tricycle on our street.Overall, I am very disappointed with the Radio Flyer product and wish I would have spent my $$ on something else."
1,Don't bother!,I thought that the name and weight of this bike would make it a great buy but my friends plastic tricyle is looking better and better. My two year old loves the bike with the exception that it falls over every time he tried to steer or climb on and the parent handle broke in half after only 1 week of use. It ruined the bike so we could not replace it. I trashed this one and bought the plastic bike like my friend did for $20 and wished I hadn't wasted the money!!
1,Surprisingly Low Quality,"Our son loved this trike when he first received it. After one year of fairly light use, almost everything on this trike has broken. The parent steering column completely broke down and can't steer, the bike squeaks and tips, and finally, the pedals stopped working (or only catch about 10% of the time). My husband tried to take the front wheel off to fix it, but it appears to be a single welded piece that does not come apart. Our son still insists on riding the bike, which usually ends up in frustration and tears when the pedals don't work. In fact, I'm online shopping for a new trike now! I strongly advise against buying this product."
1,Total Junk,"Grandma bought this for our toddler from a big box store. First problem was the poor construction of rear wheels. This trike is dangerous in my opinion because there is no way for the child to apply any braking mechanism (forget hills). The parent handle is now completely worthless since the steering bracket can no longer align with the front wheel. Cheap, made in China garbage! Boo Hiss."
3,Like it... but the SQUEAK!,"So, i read ALOT of reviews for this product and overall, definitely a high rater. I love the push bar for this. It's definitely easy to use and i'm not the shortest person. The basket in the back is great for carrying a bottle of water in the AZ heat. The kid loves it and I don't break my back helping him climb the hills.1. The bell does not stay upright so is pretty much unusableA - the biggest issue. The SQUEAK. I read the review and thought that of all the possible issues, I could live with that one. But I will say, about 1 month after using it, the bike sounds like it's 40 years old and rusted all around. It's LOUD. Extremely. To the point that it's hard to even want to take it out. I almost returned it.. and am still considering it.I would definitely recommend this trike for no other reason than it's a great learner bike and it's easy on your back, but it may be worth it to buy it at a concrete store that's easy to get to if the noise gets to you."
4,2 years and still going strong!,"I'm surprised at how many negative reviews this trike got! We bought it for my daughter when she was about 1.5, she's 3.5 now and still uses it from time to time, even though she has outgrown it (most 3.5 year olds would probably still be able to use it, my daughter is just very tall.) My neighbor is now using it for her 1.5 year old, and when my 9 month old is ready for it, she'll use it too! We loved it, it still looks great and the steering mechanism still works fine! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the annoying clicking noise it makes while you're pushing it. If the childs feet are on the pedals and they're not pedaling, it clicks! It's a safety feature so the childs feet don't get hurt by the turning pedals, and I understand it's great to be safe, but the noise was just annoying, I was very happy when my daughter started pedaling along with me pushing!Anyway, great product, great price and I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Garbage,I am very disappointed in Radio Flyer for manufacturing and selling such garbage. It is cheaply made and doesn't last long. The wheels are plastic and strip out on the inside making it impossible for my son to ride the trike. The plastic on the wheels wear away VERY fast. It is very easy to damage while assembling. So overall I would steer clear of this and any other trike that is made of plastic. We have had ours for 6 months now. My son is average weight and height and we probably use it a few times a week. Not durable at all.
1,Horrible Quality,"Started falling apart on the first use. The parent steering post became loose and slipping, finally came out of assembly. Child handle bars started getting loose then came out of the assembly and now the tires will not turn when the child pedals, they continue to slip. It's impossible to keep this product together no matter how tight you crank down on the bolts. Unless this item is super glued together it is not going to last beyond the first couple of uses."
4,So far very pleased,"My brother in law put this together for me. He claims it was relatively easy and hopefully he is not just sparing my feelings. My daughter was impressed with her new trike. I really like the adjustable seat feature as she is still a little short for the pedals. We are still working with her on being able to keep on it with feet on the pedals. The push handle is a must have for me and steers easily and nicely, I'm so glad I chose a trike with this feature. This is a new purchase so I can't speak for durability but I hope it will continue to be a great toy for years to come."
3,Fragile Push & steering mechanism,"The push & steering mechanism broke within an hour of use. I've contacted radio flyer customer service, they are backed ordered on this replacement part. It seems to be a common problem. I wish the front wheel was switchable from free-wheeling coaster hub to a normal fixed hub. The coaster hub is great for pushing a child, but bad for normal riding. A child cannot control speed or even stop, which is bad if you live on or near a hill."
2,Breaks easily,The steering handle of this bike broke by about the 4th or 5th use - which was the main attraction of buying this model. The handle bars kept coming loose so my son was steering sideways. Also tips over pretty easily - not good for 3 year olds who want to zoom around. We junked this bike after about 2 months and are using a sturdier plastic 3 wheeler that rides closer to the ground.
1,I am so disappointed with this tricycle!,"I am very disappointed w/this tricycle! The whole ""radio flyer"" brand made me think it would be great and it's not. The steering does not work, the parental handle bar is a joke- you can hardly help your child while they're riding because the bike will tip. My daughter can't reach the back foot rests and ends up dragging her feet on the road. It's now sitting in our garage while I shop for another one. This bike is not at all recommended!"
1,DO NOT GET THIS TRIKE,When we opened the box a part was broken. We called radio flyer and they said they were redesigning the part and we would get it in 3 weeks. We got the part and then the hub cap came off. We called radio flyer again and they sent three replacements. Hmmm... THEN we finally got out and the steering wouldn't stay straight. IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!! I rated it educational because I have learned a little about putting a bike together. Something I didn't know before.
4,Best first wheels for toddler!,"We ordered this tricycle for our son for his 2nd birthday a couple months ago. It is great for going on walks. The push bar is comfortable and easy to grip (though not ergonomically designed), which makes pushing a snap. Plus the bar allows you steer from behind at a normal standing stature, so there's no bending over to grasp the seat and the handle bars. My 6' husband does find the bar a hair shy of being at the minimum comfort level, so anyone over 6' may not find it as comfortable to push as a shorter person (you might still have to bend over). The construction is sturdy and durable, the wheels can go 'off-roading' at the park or on gravel.All in all a very good buy for the money! My son loves it. The bell and basket in back are also a huge hit with him. The only drawback, if it can be considered a drawback, is that you can't adjust the pedals to turn or not to turn as the trike is moving (they always turn)."
1,Horrible!,"We bought this for our daughter when she turned 2; it was very difficult for her to ride and the steering was impossible. She's now 3 and we decided to re-introduce it to her and let her ride without the parental sterring - still impossible. The bike tilts continuously and it's very difficult for her to paddle. To solve my curiosity, I took her to a toy store and had her try another trike to see if it was a paddling issue with her. The problems did not exist on the ""other brand"". This was a total waste of money. I'm going to see if I can exchange since it was only used in our basement. BUYERS BEWARE - DO NOT BUY!!!!! This really puts a damper on the Radio flyer image - I purchased based on their reputation. Based on this, I will never buy a Radio Flyier anything!"
3,difficult to stear,my neighbors purchased this trike. i have used it when watching their daughter. it is very difficult to stear by the handle and it wobbles moreso than other trikes that i have. my recommendation. keep looking....
1,UNSAFE,"The bottom line is this...the Steer & Stroll Trike has no BRAKES! I bought this trike due to the fact I like the free-flowing pedals. From an adult point-of-view, I thought it was nice to have a feature that would allow you to coast while riding the trike. The one thing that I failed to grasp..your child cannot stop unless they drag their feet. Think about it, your child is coasting down the sidewalk or driveway and something appears to block his or hers path..what do they do? As adults, we know how to coast and brake. but can your child, at 3-4yrs know what to do? Do you want to find out? Bottomline..this trike does not have brakes."
2,Worst Trike Ever,I bought this toy in May of 2002 for my daughter's 2nd birthday.The first one had to be returned for a faulty steering mechanism. The emblem on the nice little tote bag that comes with it wore off the 2nd day. The trike tips over constantly. We have called the company numerous times to get new locking clips for the handlebars because they keep turning without turning the wheel. It is a freewheeling trike which means it will pedal forward but if the child tries to pedal backward the pedals go but not the bike. This makes it VERY hard for young kids to learn to pedal. 7 other 2 year olds have tried to ride her bike and cannot. My daughter has no problem riding any other trike; but she cannot ride this one. Radio Flyer has been TERRIBLE about standing behind their product.
3,Disappointment and Regret,"I originally purchased this tricycle for my son because I was impressed with the features, had confidence in the Radio Flyer name, and liked the price. Oh, how I wish I had checked out these reviews first! Putting it together was extremely frustrating, as the steering cable came attached incorrectly. Finally, after its assembly, we gave it a spin. I am not happy with the steering handle; it has too much leeway and seems loose. Also,the bike does tip over too easily. The more we use this trike, the more regretful I am about spending our money on it. I wish I had done more research first, and chosen something else. A word to the wise: Don't buy just on name alone. If the price is right, then the product is probably inferior."
1,Doesn't teach child to ride,The trike is poor quality and the front wheel functions to allow the trike to coast. Which prevents the petals from turning when the trike is in motion. This feature has confused my child and even though we have owned this trike since she was 18 months old she still doesn't know how to petal and she is 3 now. It prevents your child from learning how to alternate legs because they don't have to. I would NOT reccomend this to another parent because of this feature. Also the coasting front wheel means THE CHILD HAS NO WAY TO BRAKE AND SLOW DOWN when on their own. This is a problem if your child encounters a small hill (or in our case steep driveway).
3,Pushing handle issues,"I got this as a christmas present for my son. Overall he loves the bike, but the removable pushing handle does not fit in real tight and there is alot of play in it. This makes it dificult to controle and hard to steer..."
5,Broken out of the box,"We picked this one up because of the Radio Flyer name and because it seemed to have many of the features we were after. We had not done any research prior to stopping at several stores and letting our little one try some out. We were pretty excited about this one until we got home and open the box. Immediately it was clear that part of the bike was broken (the portion that attaches the wheels to the frame contains a plastic part) as pieces fell out of the box. Searching for reviews I discovered that the majority of the radio flyer trikes should be avoided. Read other reviews on this site for more information.We decided to try the Kettrike/Kettler trikes. They have a great reputation and are made to last. Unfortunately they are more expensive than other trikes. If you think you are going to put your child on a bike before they hit 3 years, perhaps you should go with something cheaper and save your money for a nice bike."
1,The steering broke,"Bought this tricycle for my 16 month old and within two months, the steering broke. I guess you get what you pay for and I am going to look at Kettler."
2,No Good Radio Flyer Bike,"I brought my one year old daugther this bike for her birthday and that was in September. Now that it's the summmer and she finally get to ride it, it don't even work. I can't even control the front wheel like I'm suppose to be able to the wheel goes a total opposite direction. Also I can't push her being that she don't know how to pedal the bike yet because she to short and to little I would end up twisting her ankle. I think this was a total waste of my money."
4,My daughter loves her trike,"First off let me say, we got this as a gift from her grandparents, who put it together before they gave it to her so I have no idea how difficult or easy the assembly was. The parental steering while a good idea in theory is very difficult to manuever and takes some getting used to. There is no such thing as a quick turn with the bar. The good thing about this trike is that with the way the pedals work it has been easy for my daughter to learn how to propel herself forward. She can rock her feet back and forth and it actually moves forward. This is a good thing for now, but I'm hoping it doesn't keep her from learning how to really pedal!"
3,Junk,Do not buy this danagerous bike. My son is 3 and every time he turns the bike it tips over. He has gotten many band-aids thanks to this bike. Complete waste of money.
4,SCI FI MASTER,"Who am I to rate the masters of my youth? For me the problem with older science fiction, is that the the basic concepts have been reworked so often they no longer seem as fresh as they did forty years ago."
5,Outstanding -- one of my all-time favorites!,"The genius of this novel is that Anderson has written a taut suspenseful drama which draws the reader into it -- into the lives of the characters, their fantastic situation, their struggles, triumphs, and will to persevere. This all wrapped in a very exciting, compelling story of the first attempt at interstellar travel, and amazingly, without ""warp"" drives, or such SF devices. The story was told with a hard-science base of known, modern-day physics, and was as good a SF story as I've ever read. Truly excellent!"
3,Hard SF,"If you like your SF hard and technical, Tau Zero is worth taking a look at. The main premise of the plot is based around relativity. The faster the ship goes, the 'slower' time becomes for the ship and its crew. With the result that the crew can travel immense distances in, what is for them, a few years time; and literally watch the universe age.This is an intriguing premise, but the book, short as is, reads slow. Characterization is not well done. The crew seems to come apart psychologically too fast. After all they knew when they started they wouldn't see Earth again, and would be journeying for at least five years. I just don't believe a handpicked crew, would panic and despair in a few years, even if the universe around them had aged hundreds of millions of years.And Sweden ruling the world?"
4,Incommensurable Journey,A great story taking you to the limit of Science Fiction and making you wonder what universe is and what our place in it is. Either the relativity theory as we know it today is an indefectible truth and the human race is stuck in its galaxy branch or there is a silver bullet to take it down and TZ becomes a simple poetic novel of damned human beings.
2,Mixes dreary soap opera with a technical book.,"Poul Anderson has written some of my favorite & least favorite stories. It has some good points, but not enough & at times it sounded like a science textbook. Also the idea of Sweden ruling the world was fairly laughable. I mean no disrespect to Sweden, since being the predominate nation has a fair amount of drawbacks that you're lucky to miss out on."
1,Possibly the most overrated science fiction book I have ever read.,"A mean tough alpha-male dude takes over in a crisis, beats up anyone who disagrees with him, solves every single technical problem by sheer force of inspiration, bangs all the hot women, and becomes king. In between are long stretches of people sitting around being depressed. And a surprising number of science mistakes for a supposed masterpiece of hard SF. NOT a classic."
3,Good but not great.,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. This book does get tedious at times, but not enough for me to give up on it. I am a true fan of ""Hard Sci Fi"" and, in that respect, the author delivers. The characters seem a bit stiff, more like melodrama with the heavy, the long suffering woman, the ineffective leader and a group of people who need a lot of nurse maiding. But, like I said, if you love stories about starship travel, the ending will blow your mind."
1,Beware,"If you order the hat that is pictured, you will not receive it. I ordered this hat because it says ""BigTen"" on the side. The hat I received said ""Big"" on the side. The seller says the hat pictured is no longer available. So, why is the picture still being used to sell hats that are not available?"
2,Biology mess,"This biology book is a written fairly well, but it could be better if more thought and organization were put into it! The only problem with it are the review questions and other questions at the end of the chapters. They are poorly written and when you're looking for the answers, they're not really in the section that it was intended for. Instead, the answers are in previous sections or chapters before!! It's a complete nightmare trying to answer them! How do they expect a student to learn from and focus on a section in which you have to stop thinking about it in order to review previous chapters or sections? Be consistent and organized please!!!!"
4,"great, fun, and upbeat workout","this tape is definitely a fun, inspired workout. i love the instructor and the mtv dancers. they show you the steps b4 they do them and break them down. i love this workout. it is intense if you want it to be or a light one when you choose it to be. buy it! you will see the results after a couple of weeks."
2,Not really grooving,"I bought this video hoping and expecting it to be as challenging and good as the other volumes only to be disappointed. The workout is good, but I wish the instructor would have paid a little bit more attention to the workout than to Eric Neis. It got a little bit irritating after a while...I'd suggest the other videos before buying this one"
2,Doesn't burn the fat,"I've seen plenty of workout videos and this one doesn't make you sweat. They spend too much time teaching the steps and flirting with Eric that there isn't much room for cardio. You would think by the name of the video that you would burn fat, but I just didn't feel it. If you are just beginning to work out, maybe it would be alright. However, the steps might be a little too hard for beginners, so you can't win either way. You could probably use this tape on one of your light exercise days when you just want to have fun."
2,"This is not an exercise video, but a narcissitic dance revue","I bought several of this series of tapes looking for something different for an areobic workout. I have always been good dancer, and am in fairly good shape. The moves that they try to teach you are just steps off of something you would need years of professinal training to achieve. They might actually be able to teach some of the routine a little better if they actually spent more time on videoing them doing the steps and a little less time on thier close ups. The stupid ""hey just do the moves and stop lookin' at the chicks"" comments were really tiresome! All in all this and all the other videos in this series were just plain ole tired and very frustrating. If your looking for a work out go for a walk, you'll get more out of it."
2,Good for beginners,"This was the first exercise tape that I ever bought. The dance routine is broken down so that it is easy to learn and it is definitely fun to do. Although this tape got me excited about starting to exercise, I would not recommend this tape to most people. This tape failed to get my heart rate up and I really didn't see any results from doing it 3-5 times per week."
5,This is so much fun! I love it!,"This is an excellent workout for those in the beginning/intermediate levels. If you are advanced, this may not be enough for you. This video has one of the best instructors I've seen in a long time, and you will have so much fun dancing with the group! You will stay motivated and full of energy. Keep in mind that you need some coordination and dance ability to do this, however no special flexibility or anything like that. Eric actually keeps his mouth shut for most of this video, which is nice. This video is so much fun don't miss it!"
4,Fun workout that keeps you moving,"I've had this tape for a while, but I really started getting into it recently. Its summer and kind of boring and I wanted to do something fun and constructive. So I started doing this video almost everyday recently. I dont' like exercise, even, but it's really fun for me because I like to dance. After just a couple days, i was a little firmer. I'm still having fun doing it."
2,Difficult working with Kohler.,"I JUST this past few days received the MISSING parts that have kept the trim and valve from being installed!!! After 3 phone calls to Kohler, I finally received the missing parts and will try again to have them installed. I hope the parts sent are correct."
5,Incredible Tale of High Adventure!,"Matt Cruse is a low ranking sailor on board the Aurora, with dreams to one day pilot the vessel himself. He is not the only person with such goals, for a band of pirates under the leadership of Szpirglas, seek its riches for themselves. Matt is rocketed into a grand quest when he meets up with the pirate crew, a rich tomboy named Kate, and a dying sailor on a hot air balloon.Airborn is a sonic speed adventure from the first page to the last. In the style of Stevenson's Treasure Island, Oppel tells a story of pirates, mysterious creatures, and treasure with a unique twist. All of this is contained not in a tale of the seas, but in the skies above them. Bursting at the seams with action, romance, and mystery, Airborn is a book that shows one what happens when dreams take wing."
4,Beautiful book!,"A must read, should become classic. Beautiful writing, string plotting, complicated, compelling characters and rich themes. I was surprised I hadn't heard of it. Bravo!"
5,soars above the rest!!!!!!!!,"When I bought this book I was expecting it to be kinda boring....WOW was I wrong!!!!! this is simply one of the best fiction books ive ever read.The stary centers around Matt cruse, a cabin boy on board the airship the AURORA....he soon meets a girl named kate who tells Matt of wonderful flying creatures that her grandfather saw......and I cant say anymore without spoiling the plot...just read itp.s Kenneth oppel, are you reading this? SEQUEL NOW!!!!!!"
4,Very Good Juvenile Novel,"This is an imaginative and well constructed juvenile novel. It is set in a parallel world with somewhat different physics and history. Much of the action takes place on a giant airship, a standard mode of long distance travel in this world line, in a somewhat Victorian society. This world is developed well and its features shown unobtrusively through the action of the story.The well constructed plot is a coming of age story with 2 strong protagonists, one male and one female. Several aspects of the plot mirror the underlying themes of overcoming fear and limitations. The quality of writing is solid."
4,Fast paced but too coincidental,"Oppel kept the pace of this Treasure Islandish tale moving quickly, especially the second half. There were a lot of action scenes that will appeal to 10 to 13-year-olds. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought the strength of this novel was the first 50 to 100 pages as Oppel laid the groundwork and the history of the airships. The second half, though not predicatable, was so coincidental. So many dangerous situations for Matt seemed to resolve themselves so easily, too easily really for the author of the fantastic and unpredictable Silverwing series. Enjoy this read, but don't expect a classic."
3,Just OK,"This is a fun book for a 7th - 8th grader, but it takes a long time to get moving. The story of adventure and intrigue and fantasy is fun. The mix of fantasy and science-fiction is creative. The back story takes forever to come to light and the number and manner of coincidences is just overwhelming. The hero was always going to be a hero and everything was always going to be OK in the end. A little more tension would have been OK with me, and the various relationships could have been fleshed out more in order to create more compelling drama. To quote a certain television talent judge, ""It was just OK for me."""
5,Airborn,"As the cabin boy of the airship Aurora, Matt Cruse is completely at home in the air. On lookout one night, he spies a balloon in trouble. The crew of the Aurora brings in the balloon and the pilot tells Matt of large flying winged mammals. Matt thinks that the old man might have lost his mind and puts the strange story out of his mind. One year later, the man's granddaughter, Kate DeVries boards the ship, bringing her grandfather's journal along in an effort to see the mysterious animals he wrote about. Matt and Kate become close friends but Matt still doesn't quite believe the story. When pirates board the Aurora, Matt must do all he can to try and save his ship and his new friend Kate.This is a great read, imaginative and suspenseful. Kenneth Oppel brings to life the workings of the airship, Matt's love of the air, and Kate's attempts to prove her grandfather right. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to read the next two in the series. Highly recommended, even for adults."
4,"Good adventure story, worth reading","I got this book for my 11 and 13 year old daughters so that they could read something that was beyond the scope and subject matter of the so called YA books that are so prevalent these days. My 11 year old was pleasantly surprised that she enjoyed the book and the 13 year old will be reading it soon. It is a good adventure story that both boys and girls might like, the only thing is that I thought there were some instances at the end when Matt, the cabin boy, does pull off some incredible stunts to save the ship, but then hey, that's how heroes are born."
5,AIRBORN,"dear readersThis is an awesome book. The first few pages are pretty boring and confusing but when you get into the middle of the book, the book gets extremely exciting.Its about an airship crashing into an island that has strange creatures. The airship crashed after being hijacked by air pirates. Now two children have to save their airship from the pirates and also take informations about the strange creatures. The end is.......for you to find out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,same stuff as in first book,"This book had many of the recipes that were in her first book, Roughing it Easy. Of the new recipes that we tried, most were edible, albeit difficult for camping."
2,ITS OKAY!,I have three of her books and find the best one to be the backyard book and this one is good for the teaching and to get kids into of the cooking but some of them are a little hard for some if you don't bring all that you need to cook and she does repeet her shelf like she is looking for ideas or new food. In all I say its not bad for getting a dead line done.
1,A Big Joke,"This book contains nothing but hobo meals and other worthless recipes. If you expect to ever leave the backyard, you had best buy a better book."
4,~Perry Ellis ~360 Black~,"It smells pretty good to me, when defining the smell... it has a smell of rose petals, amber, musk, vanilla, and a touch of sandalwood to me.The smell last long, lingers in a pleasant way, I suggest to not over-spray, it's a bit strong on the initial spray but wears into your skin very well, leaving a pleasant smell.*I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like a too sweet scent but likes the side of sophistication in their choices of scent; this is a great choice for you or just anyone who likes choices, like I do, even though I am partial to sweet fragrances.:)"
5,Fun Fun Fun!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this item for my grandnices and nephews 1 to 12 years old. It was a great project for all of them.Ball #11127 Disney Funsicle Kit
4,Great jig for the price,"I just completed my first set of drawers using this jig. The results were clean, tight joints with a really solid feel. The hardest part is getting the jig setup for use with your stock. The included directions do not make this easy; the descriptions are not well worded and the photos are blurry. After reading the instructions several times I was able to setup the jig and create nice joints on the first try.The quality of the product also seems solid (not industrial but good). I think some of the quality issues in previous reviews may have been fixed by MLCS. If you are a do-it-yourselfer like me this will probably be the ideal solution."
2,"Product OK, instructions terrible","It's pretty well made, but the instructions are very bad. The basics can be worked out, but the words and pictures don't mix very well. I gave up trying for certain jobs because of that. Looks like a very bad translation of basic facts. Never again !"
1,Nothing is correct,"Very disappointed. The only pro of this product is the price. I am not a woodworking beginner, but after tried several times, this jig is:* very difficult to use* difficult to setup* the guys who wrote the manual need to be fired.In summary, low quality at a low price."
1,Blues Review,"Don't buy this CD unless you're trying to complete a collection of Albert Collins recordings. The tracks sound like they were recorded by someone sitting in the audience with a portable cassette recorder. I don't believe you can consider this CD remastered. Big thumbs down for this CD. Try ""Live in Japan"" instead, that's an outstanding CD."
3,Northern Classics Outdoor Tree Bench,"Cedar wood was very nice, BUT one of the wood slats was drilled incorrectly. I redrilled it myself. Had trouble fitting all parts of the seat together. Also I replaced the hardware for the BACK with stronger brackets. In all I would have to give this 6 out of 10, for the extra work, time and money I had to put in."
4,Good Value for Sturdy plastic speaker mounts,"I'd give them 5 stars if they were metal - even if the price was higher -- or if the elbow joint had 'teeth' instead of being a pure pressure joint.Either way, after a few days of usage, they have held up my Martin Logan MLT-2 speaker set using the keyhole mount. Of note, The little white spacer is not used per instructions, because the polymer keyhole is very 'thick' and so the spacer is unnecessary.Otherwise, these are a reasonable value, I will update in a few months to report back on how these hold up."
2,An overview at best,"It should be made clear to any potential buyer that this book is composed primarily of EXCERPTS from the various texts, not the complete works. While Barnstone is a talented translator in his own right, the translations in this book are not his. Rather, they are culled from various sources, many in the public domain, such as the R.H. Charles editions of the Pseudepigrapha. While these translations are passable, they are often not based in the latest scholarship.If you are looking for a Readers' Digest Condensed Apocrypha, this book might be worth it, but for serious study, your money would be better spent on the Charlesworth Pseudepigrapha, the Schneemelcher/Wilson New Testament Apocrypha, the Garcia Martinez Dead Seas Scrolls, and the Robinson Nag Hammadi."
3,Great Book for a Great Price,This book is great for Christians wanting to understand Biblical times and Biblical backgrounds.
2,To many qquestions,"I put it in the throw out pile. there are better sources for info in the bible. try the RED LEtter version of the bible, it shows words spoken by JESUS directly. its better info"
5,For the Serious A Must Read,"Although Barnstone's interest is Poetry, this is an invaluable source for the searching ""theologian"". I would recommend it to Bible College Student, Seminary Students, and those who wish to learn more about their Bible.Barnstone shows how writing practices affected our Modern Bibles, no matter which Version, it is a real eye-opener to see Literature that would easily resemble Sacred Scripture, every serious Bible student, Clergy or Lay, should own a copy."
4,Good overview of scripture not in the bible,This book gave me a real insight into alternative scripture. The only thing I didn't like was I felt some of the texts were to short even for excerpts. But it does give you a taste for reading more about it
5,Grateful this is in print!,"I would recommend this book to any one who is a lover of philosophy, religion and ideas! Grateful it is in print!"
4,GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE,"I recently purchased a set of these. At first I thought they were average but after about 10 days of constantly listen to music they actually started to sound better. I've only used them on my computer so I get to play with the EQ to adjust them to the different types of music I listen to. They perform well no matter what I play. They put out a decent amount of bass and the overall SQ gets about an 8 on my scale. The only complaint I have is that there is a little rattling in the right headphone. I think the majority of it came from the battery (AAA) located inside the headphone itself. I got rid of most of the rattle by insulating the battery housing. I know its jerry-rigged, but what can you do? The noise cancelling feature works perfect for me. It blocks out the AC unit and fan located right next to my desk and also my co-workers(when the music is playing), which is also a plus!!"
3,Good Noise Canceling Headphones,These headphones work great if there is no other source of radio frequency in the vicinity of cable that connects the head phones with the device (e.g. no problem in an airplane but in a car with cell phones the static can be annoying).
2,Panasonic RPHC300,The RPHC300 is not what I expected. I would describe their performance as only Ok. The most irritating feature is they appear to allow all high frequency noise pass through leaving you with a constant hissing in your ears. I initially thought that this was typical performance of noise canceling headphones. Until I had the opportunity to do my own head to head compairison of the RPHC300 to the Bose Quiet Comfort on an international flight. The Bose are worth the extra money! No hissing with the Bose.
2,More noise muffling than cancelling,"Pros: Comfortable, well made, nice case, folds flatCons: Does not really do much noise cancelling.Wanted these for airplane trips. I found that they muffled noise rather than cancelled them and then only lower frequency noises at that. You have to turn on the switch for them to work but there is no big difference in them with the switch on or off. Plus you get slight hissing with the switch on.I didn't really expect them to shut out all noise but was dissapointed in the level of noise that still leaked through. Haven't had the chance to compare with other headphones.As for sound quality for music, they seem fine but that is not why I bought them."
1,The only thing it cancels is your patience.,"I used my unit three times, and after that it started having a clicking sound in the left speaker. Changing batteries proved futile. It was only five months old, yet it was already out of warranty (just 90 days). The ""customer service"" center stringed me along with a variety of operators and excuses, and finally said it couldn't provide service or support. Basically, I was left out in the cold. Buyer beware."
2,Random Noise,"I have had these headphones for a few years now. I also do a lot of traveling for my company (ie flying). About a half year ago the headphones started emiting small pops and hisses (all of which are pretty much covered over by music). I contacted Panasonic help center and they referred me to an ""authorized dealer"". A search from their website shows the nearest ""authorized dealer"" is a measly 1200+ miles from my location. I followed through email about location and they never replied. I will not purchase another Panasonic product again."
1,Don't work for airplane noise,"I purchased a pair of Panasonic RPHC300 headphones for use in air travel. I have used Sennheiser PXC 250's, JVX HANC 100's and inexpensive noise cancelling headphones from Maxell. These are clearly the worst of the bunch at reducing the noise in a commercial jet. I was hoping that the closed design would improve the ability of these headphones to reduce cabin noise on a jet aircraft. Instead they failed to reduce the noise in the lower range and did a mediocre job in reducing the mid-range noise. I am very disappointed and I am returning these headphones."
3,annoying buzz,"I just got a Macbook, my RPHC300 headphones buzz when plugged into it. I don't find the white noise annoying at all, but this new buzz is intolerable. I called Panasonic about this, and entired into their byzantine quagmire phone hell; people asking the same questions then transfering me to someone else.. getting cut off... Panasonic customer service is the WORST!The battery is a real pain, having to remember to turn it off.. Also, noise cancelling headphone are mainly effective at blocking low level constant noise (engines)... Don't expect steallar performance if you want to block loud, irregular noises.Update: the buzzing was due to using a 2 prong instead of 3 prong plug for my Macbook. My fault!"
4,A Fair Price,"These headphones are about right for the price. I am comparing them to the Bose, of course, which is considered the gold standard. I think the Panasonic are of equal or better quality craftsmanship, which is good for the price. The Bose headset falls apart far too easily for the $300. This is a good alternative. But you will definitely hear the difference between this set and the Bose.The noise cancellation is not quite as good as the Bose headsets. An additional problem is the feedback or howling sound you can get if the cords are looped around touching each other. Interestingly, I was able to pick up a local FM station on the these headsets without plugging them into anything. I e-mailed the station about this problem and it seems to have cleared up. I am not sure if this is the fault of the headset or the station bleeding all over the spectrum."
3,good for airplane and car rides but not much else,"Amazon's description doesn't mention these are only made to cancel out low frequency noise such as airplane and car noise, and it doesn't mention the mid-hi hiss noise that they add when they are turned on (and they must be turned on to work at all).Sure they cost half as much as those Bose, but when I tried my friend's Bose, they cut out most out side noise and didn't add any of their own. I wouldn't mind using these Panasonics just for plane travel, but I would never want to use them for just 'at home listening' because of that hiss.I saw some AKG headphones with NC for about the same price as these but I haven't tried them (they might be worth a look, AKG is a serious pro audio company)."
2,Disturbing hiss - does not come close to Bose,"I had fair hopes for this product after reading reviews that claimed it to be a ""worthy competitor"" to the Bose's.No Way! That review which Amazon highlights - is totally misleading.There is a distinctive hiss which is not quite apparent in an airplane but very disturbing in a slightly quieter environment. However, that hiss does fatigue your ears after a while.When travelling Japan to SFO - my co-passenger had a pair of QC2's - we exchanged our units for a while! You can't even compare the NC performance of the two - let alone the sound quality. The Bose is way superior in every way - even comfort level.My RPHC300 pair is headed to ebay.Save your money - go for the other options out there!Probably the first panasonic product to dissapoint me this bad.Incidentally - a leading consumer magazine gave this a rather low rating confirming my experience. Amazon reviews can't always be trusted it seems."
3,This is not a noise canceling headphone,If you are looking for a noise canceling headphone this is nowhere near it. I wont reduce any sound except for low frequency; really low frequency.
1,Shoddy workmanship + 90 day warranty = a waste of money,"I received these as a christmas gift, and a few months later the left headphone detached from the headband. I called Panasonic, and was informed that the warranty is only 90 days, and that I would need to pay for its repair or replacement by mailing it to Texas. They didn't know how much it would cost to fix, and told me to call the same 800 number I had just called. Terrible. Spend the extra money to get the Bose. I wish I did."
1,piece of crap,"noise cancelling NOT AT ALL. suspect this one was defective because the noise cancelling didn't make a lick of difference in any environment. i returned them. have listened to the bose, they are wonderful. this was not."
3,Good price,"This headphone does canceled some of the noise. I know all of the noise canceling headphones will not canceled 100% of the surrounding noise, and I did't expect too much on this headphone. This headphone only canceled about 10-20% of the surrounding noise, and it just not what I expected. I returned this head phone the next day."
5,Work great,"They have my portable planer work like new. Highly recommend reading your manual, the blades fit fine, but I did not read the book and spent a lot of time locating the correct height and I would not have if I read the book."
4,Good,I bought this for my 2.5 year old daughter. She likes the story (she was Princess Jasmine for Halloween and her baby brother was Rajah) and is trying to read it. The pictures are clear and colorful. The words are simple. It's the right length. Good buy
4,"Easy instal, no ongoing issues","Easy to instal, works well, no issues in using it over the last one to two months.I use it with a DVD player linked via this box to the audio input of a good quality amp/dac (Bel Canto) and it works well and the sound quality does not seem to be adversely affected by adding this box into the set up.I have not had to reset it at all since I have had it."
3,Adapter,Did not work for what I intended it for. Had to purchase a different set of cables to get what I wanted .
4,Good,"Good product. I've been using for two year, with good results in videogames and satellite tv receiver. No losses on sound quality and volume."
5,Audio Converter,"Works well, simple and straight forward design. Be sure of your need (optical to coax) or (coas to optical). These converters work only on way-do not accidentally order the wrong converter."
5,"Worked for my Tivo HD, no hassles","My amp has 1 optical and 3 coaxial digital audio connections. Both my playstation 3 and Tivo HD are optical only. With this convertor I can have both components hooked up at the same time with no problems, it just works and I still get the dolby digital 5.1 from the Tivo. I can discern no difference between connecting the tivo directly to the amp via optical, or to this convertor and then to coaxial on the amp. I have my tivo and this unit on a timer that turns it off 12+ hours a day to save energy, and this device doesn't mind losing power each day."
2,Constantly needs to be reset,"Overall this item works as expected, but requires to be reset (i.e. cycle the power) once every 24-48 hours.I will be replacing it with another model."
1,Does not work,"Hooked it up, heard the sound, but also a ton of static. Tried multiple variations of hook up. None worked."
1,I was disspointed bigtime,"I got this to make me Wireless TV headphones work with my new TV.It got here and only had one output jack, so it is not stereo.I hooked it up and the sound quality was really bad.I don't recommend this one"
2,Cables to Go,"It did not split the sound into two channels, so that it would not be in stero. It also had a humming noise, so I returned my product."
1,Didn't work for my application,I bought the unit to convert the optical sound output on my HD TV to analog so I could connect to my stereo receiver. I found out it will not convert HD TV optical outputs because they are 5.1 surround. They should make it clear to not use with HD TV.
3,"Works, but with one problem.","This works well most of the time, but I often have to reset it by un-pluging to get the sound to work. I have not had it cut out while watching a program, but often there is no sound until it is reset."
1,Good when it works.,"It only works about 10% of the time,then only when I unplug and restart everything. It's hard to tell if the product is defective. It should be pretty straightforward."
1,It's true what they say.,"This product is no good.I often read the one star reviews just to see what type of complaints there are about a product. It is a bummer when someone else's complaint is your complaint.I installed this product, excited... then I hear the crackle of blown speakers. Only the speakers aren't blown.I do not recommend this product. Shame on this product. Getting my hopes up."
2,Good.....for a short time,"This converter did work as designed for 6 weeks, then just died! I was a little hesitant on buying it because of the several bad reviews, but I thought I might be one of the lucky ones who got a good one. NOT!! It did have decent sound quality and was cheap, looks like they have some quality control issues to work on. I'm probably now going to buy a Gefen, but they also have mixed reviews.....Seems like someone needs to build a good converter that will last"
5,Excellent converter!,I installed this little box 5 months ago and haven't given it a moment's thought since. It works flawlessly. I've never had to power cycle it. It just works. I highly recommend it.
5,optical to Coaxial converter,I used this for the purpose stated and it worked as expected. No problems and easy application for converting from optical to coaxial
5,Works as promised,"Small, easy to plug, very light. Just plug it in and it is working. It does not heat up. There is no delay in the sound either. So it is just what I needed to plug the eee Box to my amp that only has coax digital input. Great product works as advertised."
4,so far so good,"I don't use the device it's connected to much, but so far none of the dropouts others are complaining about. Will update if I hear it.Would be cooler if it were dual."
1,"Does not work like expected, for me anyways...",Terrible sound quality. It just makes hissing noises when i go through my xbox 360 menus. Pretty upsetting because I was pumped to play some Halo3 in surround sound
1,Horrible,This is by far the worst electronic product I have ever bought. It cuts out after ten minutes of playing. Everyday I have to walk over to the stereo and unplug the device and plug it back in so it will work. You get what you pay for. Do not buy this product.
5,It just works,"If you need an optical to coax cable converter, this is the device for you.It's a very simple device to install, and it just works. It does output Dolby digital 5.1, and I have never hadA bitrate problem with the device. If you need one of these devices you should press the buy button and uwill be happy with your purchase."
5,"Works great for 360, PS2 and Cable box",I got mine months ago when I realized my new Yamaha receiver did not have a optic input. This converted signal sounds great when playing Xbox 360 (Battlefield 2:Modern combat has awesome surround effects!). Also no problems with my FiOS Standard TV box and my surround sound from my custom PC. Sometimes I rarely unplug it.All 3 sources are though a Fiber Optic splitter and it sound great!
5,optical to coax converter,It item works perfectly. There is no interference with the sound signal and the quality of the sound is just perfect. Great fix for having only one optical jack in receiver.
4,Does What It Says,"The Cables to Go 40019 Optical to Coaxial Digital Audio Converter does exactly what it says it should and translates a 16-bit S/PDIF Optical Digital Audio signal to a coaxial transmision of the same value and does it at a reasonable price. it would be nice if it went in either direction but then it would undoubtedly cost more. Although the construction is a bit flimsy in the molded plastic, if treated carefully it should last a decent enough time, but if you are planning on taking it on the road I woudn't give it much of a lifespan."
3,Toslink to coax converter,"works fine when sending a signal to a digital reciever.But for some reason when I send the signal from the main reciever to another digital reciver(that powers spekers in another part of the house)It cuts out,which is something that my old Radio Shack converter(No Longer available) did not do."
5,Deprogramming from cults,"This book helps expose the evils of many so-called ""religious"" groups that use brain-washing tactics to deceive their followers into becoming fanatics. The book is an excellent exposé of the tactics used, as well as basic insight into the true, and dangerous nature of many cults. In an era of religious tolerance for everything, it seems, except Christianity, books like this are invaluable in pointing out that not all religions are so ""holy""."
1,didn't even break a sweat,I am a huge tae bo fan and I got this workout DVD thinking it would be good on the mornings that I didn't have a lot of time to devote to a workout. It was a huge disappointment. I felt like I was standing around waiting for Billy Blanks to do the next move and he never really did a good workout. I ended up fast-forwarding through the just waiting around parts and only really ended up working out for about 12 minutes. This was definately a waste of time.
4,I LOVE TAE BO,There is truly a full body workout. I ususally do the 60 min one but some days I just don't feel like this. This is a nice short alternative.
4,speech help for kids,I found much of the booklet to be helpful in my planning for teaching a middle school speech class this fall.
2,A readily available reference on the US space suit,"Unlike Lloyd Mallan's ""Suiting Up For Space"", this book is currently in print.It has plenty of photos of Apollo, and Shuttle suits. It also has plenty of photos on aborted space suit projects of the 1960's and 70's. However the quality of the text does not match the richness of the photos. The text is rather topical and seems to deal with the spaceflights themselves rather than the development of the space suit worn on the mission. It tries awfully hard to be the space equivalent of C. G. Sweeting's definitive works on USAAF flying gear and clothing:""Combat Flying Clothing""and ""Combat Flying Equipment"". ""Outfitting the Astronaut"" seems only to wet the reader's apppetite for more meatier narrative on the development of the space suit. I did find the chapter on suit preservation at NASM though."
3,A must have for the serious collector/researcher or enthusiast,"It was worth the $19.95 plus tax that I paid for it. As a collector offlight and survival gear, I found this book very interesting about thedevelopment of the space suit. However, there are no color photos, lackof photos on the 1980s blue space suits and SR-71 types, very littleinformation on survival gear and other gear besides suits. A nice book,but could be better. Check out my other reviews for flight gear relatedbooks."
2,To Me Not Worth The Price,Was disappointed...Though very informative not many pictures of actual flight worn spacesuits. Would have been great to see pictures of museum displays and some color photos would have been a nice addition.Hardly any photos of actual astronauts.
2,Buyer BEWARE!!! The sound is beyond awful!,"I don't know how this company (The Jazz Factory) sleeps at night! Great performances by an awesome quintet, but of course, that is not why I've panned this one. The plain and simple truth is that this recording is awful! People can rip on Rudy Van G. all they wish, but he and the gang at Blue Note have never released anything even remotely as poor as this. The sound quality of this CD is so terrible it's not even worth having as a collector's item.Please trust me on this one and don't make the same mistake I did! Save your hard earned dough. There are tons of great recordings out there from Miles, Coltrane, and the gang... put this one at the very bottom of the list."
1,Awful audio,"As a rule I never grant less than 4 stars to Miles Davis music, usually all five. He is the genuine Master! This album, however, is an unfortunate exception. Not for the quality of music played. It is the technical side of the recording that is the problem. The sound quality is as if someone recorded the set using a portable dictaphone hidden deep in the pocket. There virtually isn't any sound there, no trumpet, no sax, just barely present piano. Big disappointment and complete waste of money."
4,Saunders Bow Tip Protector -,"I own two of these,one for each of my recurves.This works great.It is difficult to get on at first so be patient.If you have a take down remove your bottom limb to install.I highly reccomend this as it offers great protection for a good price"
4,Cool!,"I bought this watch for the Ms. Mom of me. For Christmas.The diamonds are small but it's Seiko with lots of realistic gold toned stainless steele and sparkling little diamonds around the face.She was thrilled.List price: $350, I paid $94. Her appreciation for a nice gift: Priceless.At this price - don't think twice."
3,Manicure set review,"Not top notch but not bad, the tweezers won't grip, the scissors are a bit flimsy but sharp, and the latch on the case slips open, otherwise o.k."
4,...life after the internet bubble...,"There are not many books dealing with virtual organisations and e-business after the internet bubble did burst! Did most writers models collapsed with the stock market? This book certainly shows that modern ICT is still an important issue leading, if applied in a coherent strategy, to a competitive advantage. It proves that the virtual organisation is an organisational form of the 21st century. This book is a must for people who are interested in strategy."
4,It Was GREAT!!,This book was great. I loved it. It always made me want to keep reading. I recommend this book to everyone.
3,Sniper,"Book ReviewSniper is another intense novel by Theodore Taylor. [This is his] another suspenseful masterpiece that is sure to be enjoyed by readers.Sniper tells a story of a young fifteen year old, Benjamin Jepson, who's in charge of his family's lion preserve in Los Coyotes, California. Everything seems fine until utter chaos breaks out. In the middle of the night, a sniper lurks around waiting to kill. This event leads Ben on an epic adventure to a surprising twist at the end.This creative contains colorful language and only has minor flaws. For one, at times the story seems to drag on and on, without many details or sensory images. However, this novel is still a great choice for all of you young detectives out there. (...) Get off your chair and buy it today! You won't be sorry."
2,Utterly disappointing,"I read ""Sniper"" a few years back, and I must say that it was terribly disappointing. By the time I had finished reading the book, it seemed as if I haden't been reading it for very long... not because it was engrossing or interesting, but because it was devoid of real content. Young adults would be advised to read ""The Cay"" and skip ""Sniper""."
1,Lamo-Braino,"I was unfortunate enough to have to read this book for a school book report. I would have rather taken a zero, but it would have brought my grade down and gotten me off of the honner roll. (I get a huge party if I make it 3rd trimester). How ever the book should not be rated at youg audult, it should be somewhere in the childrens section; due to it's childish plot and easy reading. The only way I would reccomend this book is if you are locked in a cell and your starving, so this very badly written book can take your mind off of your throbbing stomach. Thedore Taylor, I'm very disapointed!"
5,A Wonderful Book,"It seems that books on beaded flowers either have great photographs and mediocre or worse instructions or good instructions and poor aesthetic values. This book combines glorious and inspirational pictures with incredibly clear and well-designed instructions. The author is obviously a meticulous and accomplished artist. She is also a wonderful communicator and teacher. If you can only buy one book on French beaded flowers, this is the one you want. If you already have books on this art, buy this one and renew and increase your enthusiasm for making these beautiful blooms!"
1,NOT for raw beginner!,"Page 16: ""In order to create a majority of the flowers, using the French technique, it is necessary to first master the technique for 'Creating the Framework' upon which the leaves or petals will be made."" Thereafter follows only two cryptic paragraphs of text and one small (2"" x 2"") low contrast and unlabeled photo about this absolutely essential procedure. Page 16 says at the top ""No experience necessary"" plus I READ pages 1 to 15 carefully, have 40 years of many and varied crafting experience and a college degree. But I swear I cannot figure this page out for love or money. And I don't understand why it's so bad, because all the other instructional pages seem to have numerous, good quality, high contrast photos demonstrating every itty bitty step. Not that I can try them out to see if they are any good, since I can't get past page 16."
2,Travel Back,"This purchase was the end of a long search (30 odd years)for this Album. I brought it only for one track, Vampire. The rest is mainly rubbish but I consider the Album worth every penny I paid as it was one of the prize Albums I lost when it was stolen back in the 70s. As a retired skinhead of that era, I am rebuilding all my collection and this Album was 2nd to last to complete. All I need now is Swanlake Reggae by The Cats and Im done.This Album is well worth buying if you already know the Album but otherwise youll be very dissapointed. Daybo"
2,No names.,"This book contains only a description of the different forms of personal wealth in France, like real estate (urban and rural) or financial wealth.It doesn't give names. It neither constitutes an investigation of existing financial structures (holdings, investment banks, controlling shareholdings ...)Too theoretical."
4,Flip on ESPN and pass me a beer,"Like the author, I found myself engaged to a die-hard hockey fan. This book is a great place to start for the newly-initiated hockey girlfriend. It's a quick read, the author's racy innuendos give it a Girls' Night Out tone that's a lot more inviting and easier to relate to than other intro books. The stats and trivia are great, but will need to be updated eventually. Nice to see coverage of women's hockey, too.PS - the bit about defensemen on page 19 is totally true ;).Also recommended:* Without Fear: Hockey's 50 Greatest Goaltenders* Hockey's Best Shots: The Greatest NHL Photography of the Century"
2,"Not ""good"" but I found it entertaining","I actually got a kick out of this movie. I just watched it yesterday on Sci Fi. I had never seen nor even heard of it before but there wasn't much else on, so I decided to give it a try. I think I may have missed a little of the beginning but I got to see most of it. It's not a ""good"" movie by any means but I found it more engaging and entertaining than a lot of other movies that Sci Fi shows. For some reason I found Simon Bossell's character especially appealing and I liked that he didn't seem to take his role too seriously, though he wasn't exactly hamming it up.I really enjoyed Charles Tatum's description of this movie, found below. It's definitely accurate, but I wouldn't call it an ""awful awful movie."" I've seen much worse. It's by no means Oscar-worthy but if you enjoy slightly goofy sci fi movies that don't offer much explanation, this is a decent choice."
2,Aberration,"To put things in perspective - this isn't, I believe, a movie that is meant to be taken very seriously. It plays out in semi-humorous form in somewhat the same manner as Leprechaun.That said, Charles Tatum's review was more fun to read than the movie itself was to watch!"
4,Pretty near perfect.,"I bought this about a month ago and wear it all the time. I love how big and intimidating it is. However, when I first got it I saw the inside of the semi-hollow wolf head had tiny metal slivers sticking off the edges, so I filed them off. After that, no problems. I do have to emphasize this ring is BIG. I'm tall and have long fingers. Even so, the wolf head covers most of my finger in between my knuckles (I wear it on my middle fingers). So if you have tiny hands, be forwarned. It's definitely a statement piece, and the only things that could be improved are the snout of the wolf (a little too skinny and flat, but not bad enough to have returned the ring) and the metal slivers I mentioned. If these two things were fixed, the price would be very fitting. As it is, I think it could be a bit cheaper. I still love it, though."
3,Pewter men's wolf rinbg,"This ring is heavy and mine needed some additional filing to remove burrs on the inside of the ring. The detailing could be better and the muzzle is too broad, but was worth the price I paid. I wouldn't classify this as a ""werewolf"" - more a classic ""wolf"" or even ""dog"" design. The ring arrived promptly as promised."
2,work 2 days only,"i have tried two of these batteries but they work two days each, and after that it stopped."
2,buttons are low quailty,"well i bought one because my current wireless was breaking. the first one i got, you had to press L2 extremely hard for it to register. i RMAed it and amazon promptly sent me another one. the second one didnt have such a serious issue as the first but a few buttons (namely top on the dpad, select button and triangle) had to be pressed harder then i would like for it to register. still deciding on whether to return the second for a refund"
2,Not good,"I didn't order the controller online, however I ended up buying it for only $10.00 since it was on sale. I'm glad I didn't pay much for it. It lasted for only about 2 months of gameplay when the X button jammed. Since I have 6 other controllers I could use, I took off the back to this and found out that the pad for the right shape buttons was slightly cut, causing the button to jam while your furiously trying to skip scenes or using it to fight. Because of this minor issue, the controller didn't work and since most of the games relied on the X button, it was pretty much done for. During play it was fine till the button jammed, then it was pretty much useless, you can get better controllers than this and cheaper, believe me. So don't buy it and find something else."
5,The thirty year mystery,"Nancy Drew has a new case and saves Todd Harrington from a gunshot! Todd's father was killed and whoever killed him, doesn't want Nancy to solve this case. Hanna and Mayor Abbot have secrets, too. Nancy reveals them. To find out more about the many secrets in River Heights, read this incredible book! It's very suspenseful and I couldn't put it down."
1,didn't work,the print said that it would work with my Kodak camera - but the battery does not fit so it is useless
5,Great Product,My old charger was iffy as to the contacts connecting so i replaced it with this charger and it works beautifully and it charges real fast.
4,Nikon MH-62 Review,"We tried ordering another compatible battery charger from another web site. The price gave you more for your money, but when we got the product it didn't work. We went ahead and ordered this one, which is what actually came with the camera, and it worked perfectly. I'm glad Amazon had it available."
3,Good unit with one minor problem,"Good product - however - for long term storage the battery should be DISCHARGED ! I would hope the unit would AUTOMATICALLY take care of that necessity, charging the battery when one wanted to use it, perhaps overnight the night before intended use."
1,not the right item,The item I received didn't match what I ordered and then the wrong one was mailed to me again. I gave up and went to radio shack for a universal charger.
3,Wrong size,This did come quick and it looks like the one I needed but it wasnt. It was too big for my battery. Be careful that you know the size you need before you order.
5,Great charger..,"Lost my coolpix charger, glad I found this one. Perfect fit for my camera batteries. It arrived on time, great condition. I'm very happy with it."
5,Just what I needed,"These filters are awesome. Easy to clean, and outlasts any cheap paper filters. Very happy with my purchase. It matched right up with my previous modification on my 1996 Mazda B2200."
3,Nice but small,Nice jacket but runs very small. Ordered L instead of normal M and but had to return as was way too small for a jacket. Did not reorder as though XL would be too small also. A jacket needs to be baggy! If you normally buy anything more than S you might want to stay away from this otherwise great jacket.
5,Initial Thoughts,"So far, so good - I have used this for the last 4 days and have tried 3 of the 4 forms of charging - USB, A/C, D/C - all of which have worked just fine (on a Moto-Q).The small size and modularity of the device is awesome - just what I was hoping for. I love it when technology works as advertised. The only other thing I could hope for is longetivity out of the device - will post back if there are any issues in the future."
2,Contradiction is a word Malachy knows not!,"First of all, as a recovering Irish Catholic alcoholic I must congradulate Malachy on his fine job of describing what it's like to be intoxicated. Thank you Malachy, for without your help I would never have known! Idiot! Contradiction is indeed a word not in Malachy's volcabulary, for he spends a fair amount of time bashing capitalism while at the same time attempts to make a PROFIT off of ""Angela's Ashes."" Frank should slap his brother up side the head for the embarrassment he has imposed upon Frank's reputation. Malachy, you are no Frank, just a pathetic self-centered drunk. Instead of writing why don't you go visit your friend Ronald Reagan. You are no friend to the proletariat."
3,"Frank he is not, but he writes an interesting tale.","Malachy McCourt may be capitalizing on his brother Frank's fame from Pulitzer Prize winner Angela's Ashes, but he still writes a hilarious yet moving story. His drunken tales of his early days in New York City - and actually throughout the globe - will keep you laughing and wondering how anyone can write with such an amusing play on words. I found the ending of the story to be demoralizing and desperate. When his father finally reappears and hasn't changed a bit, I think Malachy realizes how much he is his father's son and what a lousy father he himself has been. I hope there is a sequel to let us know how things turned out for Malachy and his two children."
1,Too little too late,"I admit it, I wouldn't have bought this book had it not been for ""Angela's Ashes"" Several pages in I realized it wasn't anything close. It's a story about a drunk who's life stories teach us nothing. Page after page of disgusting behavior you would think he would be embarrased to tell. The last two pages were so moving, yet when I closed the book it reminded me of Malachy's relationship with his father, too little too late."
1,No humor here!,"I'm sorry that I wasted my money on Malachy's book. Unfortunately, the author did not inherit any family talent for story telling.His stories of habitual drinking, raw language usage and continual celebrity name dropping over and over again made for an extremely boring read."
4,Good Read,"Malachy is not Frank, and thus has a very different style. I have recommended this book to others. Worth the read."
1,A tedious story written by a horrible man,"I, like many others here, wanted to read this book due to my appreciation of Angela's Ashes. It is a great disappointment. It tells the stories of a drunken ne'er do well and how he injures just about everyone around him, wife, mother, children, brothers. I kept waiting for the part where he sees his wrongful ways and corrects all and makes all well. He never does. Its a story of how alcohol and laziness can ruin a life."
5,Recommended for anyone with an opinion of world politics,"Excellent history of the 1930s leading up to WWII. Recommended for for those who are interested in the parallels between the 1930s and current world affairs. This book is written at a high reading level, but I enjoyed looking up/learning new words (mostly British terms) as I read it."
5,I couldn't put the book away!,"Dark Valley is a truly marvelous piece of work. Its great bloc of almost 900 pages is brilliantly connected and the chapters almost are read by themselves. It's really amazing the way which Brendon carries the narrative, inserting in it colourful descriptions, smells, all the environment that surrounds the ""actors"": Hitler, Stalin, Franco, Mussolini, Hirohito, King George, Churchill... they come alive to your room and you feel that you really got to know them. Moreover, the author gives us a clean historic narrative, without romantic nor ideological views. If there were eleven stars, this book would have rated 11cheers!"
5,Extraordinary,"This book provides a multi-faceted history (i.e., social, economic, military, political, diplomatic) of the major powers (and their relations with the minor powers) for the period between the world wars. Very well researched from primarily sources and very well written. From reading it one understands how this period came to be as a result of WWI and how it ended up leading to WWII."
3,Some information useful to black powder gunsmiths,"There are some good pictures of gun smiths in this book, performing various techniques. Also a pretty good history of gun smiths, if that sort of thing interests you. The guns they show are flint lock.The black smithing, horse shoeing and iron making are pretty slim. How to make a horse shoe, cow bell, and stove poker are about it. They discuss how they rebuilt the iron furnace, but not how to use it.I would recommend this book only to black powder gunsmiths, or those interested in rifle history."
