3,Stuff,"At the very start Anton is listening to a Rancid song (on a walkman), and Sublime is playing when he first goes to his friends basement, and again at the end...... this cd would be better if those songs were on there (the rancid song was ""Bloodclot"")."
3,Whats with this album?,"It has some good songs, but most of the good ones aren't even on it. For example...when Anton finds Molly's lyrics book (David Garza..""Core"") and when Anton smokes nutmeg and oregeno (Rob Halford with Two) Just two examples"
3,Whats the name?,Hey if u could tell me the name of the song that is on after anton smokes the nutmeg and oregano it would really help me out. If you know please email me at SlimShady096@usa.net Thanx ~mark
3,answer to missing song,"In response to the question about what song is playing while Anton and Molly are on the bed, it is Vanessa Daou- How do you feel."
2,Leaves a garlic taste in your mouth,"I got this Garlicin with the intention of helping me lower and control my high blood pressure. When I take these pills, the taste of the garlic rises from my stomach up to my mouth after about 30-45 minutes. I can almost taste the garlic. This side effect doesn't last long, though.Also, I had to stop taking it for a couple of days, because it gave me a terrible stomachache. Sometimes I had to sit down and rest until the pain subsided. Some days it made my stomach hurt and some days it didn't. As I type this, I have 4 more left and will finish them. I will not be purchasing this product again. I will try another brand. I know this product has helped a lot of people, but unfortunately it did not agree with me. Perhaps, it reacts differently with me."
2,Moods,"Unfortunately this is a budget cd. AQ was way average. Can someone tell me how to get a better quality CD on moods? Neil's ""Long fellow serenade"" album AQ was fantastic. Would prefer that AQ to be on moods.When u listen to Neil's songs thru yr earphone, it's suppose to transport u to another planet, if u're still on earth after listening, then u better go get another better quality cd."
4,It brang me pleasure,"Yeah, I know, there's no such word as ""brang."" I was so impressed with this record, way back in 1971 or whenever, I mentally glossed over that fact when Neil crooned it so dramatically in ""Play Me.""I was an adolescent, particularly susceptible to clever weavings of word and tune; and this record seduced me, took me heart and soul, as only a hormone-drenched fifteen-year old can be taken.On the sunset side of fifty, I find myself still deeply moved by the music, the emotion Neil infused into each phrase, the angst of the whole enterprise.And that rates four stars, don'tcha think?"
5,This thing is really cool,"Hey im Brandon, I just wanted to say that this is a really cool buy and even better its real cheap. I bought this for my 12 string and it works great it takes a little bit to keep it still I put a little bit of masking tape under it and it did the trick, just to keep it from sliding. 1 is for tune and the other is for volume and theres a little bit of static but so little that its hard to tell... only when ur not playing at all can you here it just a bit..."
3,good for the price,it is ok you have to turn amp up pretty loud because it doesnt pick up the sound very well so I wouldnt recommend it if you are gonna be playing more than 1 guitar off the same amp but otherwise its great.
4,it works,"looks exactly like it does in the picturesit works pretty good with my ampthe only thing that i dont like about it, is when u accidently touch the pickup, you can hear the scratching soundsand it doesn't tell you what the two knobs are for, my guess is one is volume and the other one is tone"
4,review,"it has awesome sound quality, but you just have to adjust it because it wiggles a little bit I just put a piece of cork in the hook to stop the rattling"
2,Stethoscope,"I ordered a black stethoscope and was sent navy blue. Doesn't match the rest of my equipment, but I don't have time to exchange. Works okay for the price."
1,disappointed,"The picture of the costume makes it look adorable, but when I opened the package, I was disappointed. It looked very cheap. I could have done a better job making one."
4,Kelsys Floating lounger,"My purchase arrived on time in new condition. So far no problems, just used for the first time last week. So far holding up."
4,makes me fall asleep,"This chair is so comfortable I fall asleep in the pool. Really nicely made, thinking about buying another on efor my husband."
2,Lasted one day,"I was very excited to use my floating lounger at the island resort. After floating on the Lazy River Pool, it started losing air. It would not reinflate. Sadly, it was a loss. It was a great float the short time I used it. My husband & I saw 2 other trashed floats like the one I purchased (same style). There was no way to get to the interior of the float to assess the problem or repair it."
1,Not durable,"THese products are not durable, after one use the nylon fabric ripped in multiple places. The user was a 125 pound girl."
1,Floating lounger,The lounger did not hold up well at all After only 2 days it began to come apart where the inner mesh is stitched to the outer floatation area. I would not recomend this item for use by average size adults. Not made to last :-(
2,"Unfortunately, not made to last, and not designed for small person","This was to replace a similar pool lounger we had for two years that had finally worn out. When I opened the Kelsyus, I liked the spring construction, and it seemed similar enough to the one we had. However, when I tried it out in our pool with a good book, I found that the dimensions were not comfortable for resting my arms; it was too wide, but may fit a taller person just fine (I am 5'2""). After using the float for shorter than two weeks (only used gently, no children, pets or rough-housing) we could see that the fabric around the seat seam had begun to tear. We therefore returned this item and are looking to find something more durable."
3,Its Okay,My first impression of the item after opening the box was not good. I think for the money it is a bit overpriced. And I can see longevity will be a problem with this item. The mesh that a person sits in does not appear it will last very long. The thing has already ripped (though my wife thinks she can sew it and fix it) after only having it a month and probably only using it less than a dozen times.
3,Mom from California,"The design is VERY COMFORTABLE however after 2 days in the lake, the seems between the foot float and rest of lounger started to tear. Lounger still works but not sure how many more seasons we will get out of it."
1,Don't bother,Good looking float however no durability. We purchased one of these less than a month ago an the seams have all busted out. Returning for a refund.
1,Not worth the $s. Same item at Walmart for $14.98,"When I purchased this item I believed it was going to be of better quality than a similar I item I purchased from Walmart last year for only $14.98, that item was being sold under the name ""Swimways"". Imagine my surprise when I received my new float from ""Kelsyus"" and it was the same exact item just with ""Kelsyus"" Painted on the side. But then I discovered that the tag attached to the float says ""Swimways"" I realized I had been a sucker. They just painted on a new name on a cheap product and pawned it of on me. Save your self over $30.00 and shop around. This is a great float and very comfortable but in no way worth what they are trying to sell it for."
3,"Not for big people, and cheaper at Target","My wife really enjoys this float, however it's not ideal for sunning while in the pool since it can only be used sitting up. For me, being a big guy, it's not an ideal float. At 6'+ it's difficult to sit in, and the cup holder is virtually useless since my size pushes the middle well under water. The most disappointing thing was that after purchase, and waiting for delivery I found the exact same floats at Target for a few bucks less, and with out the wait. The nylon casing isn't very durable, but the bladders inside seem to hold up well. All in all, not a bad product, but not as unique or cheap as they make it seem on the Amazon site."
2,Kelsyus Floating Lounger,Returned the first one ... it ripped at the front left seem. Received another one and it did the same thing ... While it is still usable the quality of the material and workmanship is lacking....
5,Easy to use,Love this!!! It is the easiest floatie I've ever gotten on...there is no hiking up the leg to get on it - balance is not needed... I'll probably get more of this for next summer...
4,floatie,"I love the floatie, but it does have a slow leak somewhere. Maybe the plug is leaking. Need to contact the company, but thanks for the quick response on sending it"
5,We love these loungers,"We purchased two of these loungers for our pool, with the intention that only adults would use them. The kids love them as well, and these loungers have tolerated a lot of hard use. We were a little concerned about the quality based on some previous reviews, but our experience has been great. These loungers are ultra comfortable and are well worth the money."
2,Disappointed,"Although this float is great as far as comfort, this company has a long way to go to perfect the construction. The lighweight nylon fabric is far too easy to tear. Within a couple weeks of use the seat portion was tearing away from the sides, and this was with NO rough use at all. I'd bought Swimways rafts in the past and was disappointed for the same reason and had hoped that there had been some improvement in this design. Unfortunately there wasn't."
1,Very disappointed with Kelsyus and Amazon.com,"I purchased 2 of these floating loungers in early May 2011 as part of a birthday present. We live in St. Louis and not able to use them until recently due to weather. One of the floating loungers leaks air. I went on line to try to exchange, but kept running into the a return expiration date of June 13, 2011. It is now June 18, 2011. I paid $51.09 per lounger. I'm deeply disappointed and will not be returning to Amazon."
1,SHIPPING COST!,"I was going to buy 2 of these, but they wanted over $20 just to ship them! That's almost the cost of one float! Ridiculous."
2,Loved it until it broke.,It is very comfortable and was great until it ripped on the foot portion after 3 uses. They should be more durable. Return window is too short. In my climate we do not get to use the pool much - not recommended unless they improve this product.
2,I loved it...until it deflated.,I loved this float. I used in my pool for about a month then it split at the seam (hole in flotation part) and it took on water. I tried to fix it.....but it did not work. I would try another hoping that the same thing wouldn't happen. But for now I am very disappointed. I guess what do you expect for made in China.
2,No match for Florida sun,"The Kelsyus Floating Lounger looked awesome so I was really excited when they came. Unfortunatly they didn't last long in the florida sun, I could handle the dark blue fading but the mesh that creates the seat and surronds the pillow pretty much crumbles after a few months."
2,Only one of two ordered was as expected.,"One of the two I received did not have a good seal, so after attempting to fill it a few times and still noticing that it did not hold all the air, and before even putting it into the pool, I decided to package it up and exchange for another. Only problem was, the product went from $39.95 each on July 6th, to $51.99 each on July 12th, and could not be sent back for an even exchange. If it had come from Amazon itself, that would have been possible, but not when coming from an outside seller. I will definitely think twice before ordering something from an outside seller that may increase its price within a couple days, and not allow an even exchange for a defective product."
2,Love This Float But Failed to Hold Up,"Within two months of purchase, it developed a hole in the netting that quickly grew. Up till then, it was our favorite pool lounger. We have a salt water pool so I don't think pool chemicals contributed to the wear.This is the second Kelsyus pool product we have had that failed in a very short time. Wish they'd use stronger materials."
5,Great Floating!,"I purchased two floating loungers, they were so easy to air up and ready to use in no time. We tied up on lake LBJ in Central Texas and thoroughly enjoyed the comfort of these floatees. I would recommend them to anyone that likes to sit up comfortably and have conversations while floating. Plus, they were easy to deflate and pack away for the next trip!"
5,Kelsyus Floating Lounger,Love it! Ordered 1 & have since ordered 2 more. I bought the flat ones when they 1st came out but never could get it back into the bag again. They must've fine-tuned their construction because this one actually does easily collapse & fold back down into bag (read the easy instructions). Inflates/deflates quickly. So Nice to actually be able to float on the water & sit up now! Cup holder is a great plus too. Highly Recommend this!!!
5,LOVE this float !,"I was looking for a float for our pool, one where I could just lay back, and relax, while listening to our music from our outside patio speakers. Read many reviews, and decided on this one. This float is EVERYTHING that I expected, and better. I can just sit in it, head back, with the stereo on in the back ground, and relax for an HOUR in it. Love it, definitely recommend it. I'm 5' 10"", 230 lbs, and it is so comfortable."
4,great pool lounger,This float is very comfortable. We recently purchased an above ground pool so I bought 2 of these floats. We love them! Only problem is the material between the seat and the foot rest has already ripped. This does not effect the function of the float but was a little disappointed that we had only used these 2 days before they ripped. Only adults used these floats and no rough use so they should have held up.
2,BAD STITCHING,RAFT IS COMFORTABLE BUT STITCHES RIPPED OUT THE FIRST WEEK. WE THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE MORE MONEY THEY WOULD MAKE IT FOR THE SEASON.
5,Best pool float,"This is the same as some that Swimways makes (same company). For the money they cost, they are super-comfortable. I fall asleep in these all the time. They are the only ones I would get."
4,Great pool float,"This is the perfect float to transport. It folds up nice but when opened, it's spacious and comfortable. Looks exactly like the picture in real life. Love the hole at the bottom - great for hanging on and snorkeling. Arrived in record time."
3,Floating Lounger,Very comfortable and easy to get in and out of. Material is a little thin may not hold up for as long as I would like it too!
2,Would not buy,These chairs did not last. One season and the material where the footrest tore on both sides. I do not think they were made well.
5,The best pool float ever,"Over the 20 years of pool ownership, I have tried many many floatation devices (chairs, mats, etc). This is by far the best ever. Incredibly easy to get into, extremely comfortable, and terrific. After buying one, I quickly ordered a second. Next spring I will order two more. This is a great product!!!"
3,read this if you use chlorine in your pool,"We've owned 4 of these. They're the most comfortable float out of a half dozen different kinds we've tried. But, here's the problem. The seat is a wafer thin water permeable material that disintegrated after just two seasons in our chlorinated pool. If you use chlorine, and don't mind replacing the float after one or two seasons, I highly recommend it. We've switched our pool sanitation to a Clearwater ionizer which doesn't harm anything except algae and bacteria so we're counting on getting many years out of our Kelsyus floats, but chlorine really does a job on them."
4,Never go to a resort without it...,I bought this to try out. I learned on my last resort trip these are great at the pool to just relax in large open pools. I am 300lbs and about 6 feet and it works for me. The limit it says is 250 but it fit me fine. Mind you the cup holer sank in a bit but it holds well. It's also so easy to blow up. Only the bag part and foot rest need inflation. There is a metal wiring that holds it all together. Also it has a nice carrying back that flattens out for travel. I highly recommend this for anyone going to a resort with a pool or lazy river. I'm going to buy another one for my g/f so we both have one
3,Good,"Chair itself is very comfortable and nice but, my second time use lounger's extended part stitches came a part and I was very disappointed. That is why I gave 3 stars.Thank you."
4,great pool lounger!,Great buy for our pool! Very comfy float to lounge in but the cup holders are too small! They are exactly the size of a can/bottle so they don't accommodate a coozie or cup with a lid and straw. Make the cupholders bigger and it's 5 stars all the way!
2,RED-EARED SLIDER,THE BOOK HAD A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. THE BOOK LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN THROUGH A FIRE. OR A CRIME SEAN AS IT HAD A LOT OF BLACK STUFF ALL OVER IT.
5,MISSY SHOULD BE AN AMERICAN IDOL CONTENDER,"I can identify very strongly with Missy's dream of someday performing on Broadway. The support and encouragement her friends and parents give her in pursuing this dream is intoxicating. While she's popular and admired by everyone that knows her, she doesn't let this go to her head in any way, preferring instead to focus on the needs of her friends and helping others whenever she is able. Not only does she possess the talent to be an American Idol, she has all the positive attributes we would like to see in such a person."
5,MISSY HAS STAR QUALITY,"Reading this book gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling about the importance of friendship and the way it can often guide our lives in the right direction. The members of her club, FOCUS TIMES TEN, seem to feed off each other in a positive way, bringing out the best in each other with their support for each other. The completion of character development in Book 1 seems to set the stage for a very promising book series with endless possibilities. I will look forward to the release of Book 2."
3,lego soccer watch,"i felt it was very flimsy and breakable, hard to put links together especially for children. 5 seconds out of the box and one link was broken."
4,smaller,"Ordered for christmas gift. not sure how well it will work unil it is given. the only down fall i see with it so far is, it is much smaller than i thought it would be. picture makes it seems larger."
4,watch,"Gift for relative, didn't see it but received thank you note from them that thanked me for the gift, they liked it!"
4,cute for young kids!,I purchased two of these for my niece and nephew for Christmas. They both seemed to like them. I think they would be great for any lego lover child!!!
3,FOR MY NEPHEW,I PICKED THIS OUT 4 MY NEPHEW 11 YRS OLD WHEN I GOT IT THE BOX -BOLDLY PRINTED ON IT -FOR AGES 6 AND UP -WELL HE TOOK IT GRACEFULLY-[11YEAR OLDS DO NOT -DO NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT SAYS 6 YEAR OLD-]AND ALSO THANKED ME - I WISH IT WAS IN THE AD OR A PIC OF THE BOX
3,Cheaply Made,The legos are cheap plastic. It's cute but not good quality. It would have been better if the legos were more like rubber.
4,Great first watch - LEGO Kids' 4193356 Soccer Watch,"This LEGO watch comes with plenty of color bands (blue, yellow, red, green among others) to reproduce your kid's favorite team - it's not only black and white.At this time, however, black and white are sufficient.The wrist strap extension process took a total of about 10' since we did not have previous experience with a LEGO watch - an infinity, of course, when a kid wants to use it _immediately_. It is straightforward, though.Bonus: a LEGO character!Our godson will be learning the time the good ol' fashion way.Any LEGO watch, at this price point and for the intended use, is highly recommended. You can always ""pass on your *a-hem* Patek Philippe"" later in life... ;-)"
5,Just great,Our son loves the soccer design. It is very functional. Many kids watches have a good design but are hard to read. Not this one! And it is surprisingly sturdy and easy to adjust! AAA+
3,Cheaply Made,"I bought this for my 7-year-old nephew since he recently started playing soccer. He absolutely loved it, however, the very next day, the clasp became loose and since he's 7 and is into sports, it constantly falls off. It will only be a matter of time before he loses it. While the design and idea of the watch is nice, the quality is pretty crappy."
3,Fun watch but lacks function for kids,"The watch is really fun, my son loved it when he opened it as a gift. The issue is that it's very easy to come apart so it keeps coming off or he loses pieces when he takes it off."
2,soccer watch but more of a toy,"I would not recommend this watch if you want a ""real"" watch. It is cheaply made and more of a toy than a watch. It falls apart easily. I bought this for my 5 year grandson as his first watch and probably should have gotten something that would stay together."
1,Disappointed,The product was a gift for my son. It didn't work correctly; the timing device had a malfunction. We felt the product wouldn't last too long on active 7 year old. It was very novel idea but it wouldn't be functional for long with all unclasping and wear. We were disappointed in the quality.
4,Undependable company,I will be leary of products with no image from now on.. Product never received even after follow-up. Am working on the credit to my account.
3,Wish this little crock was available with a cover!,"Agree with another reviewer, a set would be nice AND covers to allow slaw, cukes in sour cream, fresh tomato slices etc. to marinate in the fridge with service in the pretty crock container."
1,"Tony Todd, womens prison, zombies...what's not to like?","Well, you'd think this had the makings of a cult classic ala ""Manos"" or ""Plan 9""...they've even advertised martial arts. How can you go wrong with all these elements? Oh yeah, don't write any type of script, get the worst actors you can possibly find (even Tony's horrible in this) and shoot the whole mess on video. This movie is so awful it can't even be enjoyed in that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" way.""Shadow: Dead Riot"" is, hand's down, the worst movie I've seen in a decade. Stay very far away from this. I'd give it a zero rating if allowed."
1,Completely redundant.,"One would think that Fangoria editor Michael Gingold would have seen enough crappy horror movies to know when he was contributing to the problem, but Shadow: Dead Riot stands as testament to the opposite. It's a good thing that a healthy fraction of the horror fan population seems to relish any movie with bare breasts, gore, and heavy metal tunes, because those are the only people who will give this picture's investors a return on their money.Skip this flick and go with one of the half-dozen GOOD zombie movies released in the last ten years: 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, something else besides this."
2,Women in Prison & Zombies,"This movie is OK. If you like the women in prison exploxiation movies then if kind of your cup of tea. If your a zombie lover might go wrong. You can sum up this movie with chicks in jail,that know some martial arts and Tony Todd the master of rising the dead. There are some good gore effects. There one scene is worht the watch. I would say red box. But its definitely not worth buying. Even Tony Todd couldn't say this film."
5,fabulous gadget,"If you love the taste of fresh cream, this is a must have gadget! Easy to use and impressive to those who have never seen one before. Fun!"
5,no charger with product,"Hi, We are happy with our whipper, but it does NOT come with a charger.The description on amazon says that a charger is included, but there are none in the box. The box just comes with the whipper. You will have to buy chargers separately to the Whipper."
1,Terrible,"The text seems like it was dictated into a word-processor, shuffled a little and printed with no editing and no research.Portions of text are repeated exactly in different sections of the book. The tables and diagrams are reprinted from random product literature and have no relation to the text. The entire content relevant to home heating installation and maintenance could be compressed into a pamphlet.Perhaps the team responsible for this book learned from the same school as those who prepared Saddam's perplexing weapons reports.This is the worst textbook I have ever seen, and a waste of time."
1,John Fedchock sux,"This guy doodles everything all the time, sounds like Bill Watrous on a bad day. Even Watrous has a great smooth ballad non-doodle style and phenomenal range. I met this guy a few times in person and he has this greater than everyone attitude...not very becoming of a true jazz musician. Nothing new here, he does not push any envelopes for me, better off with Conrad Herwig for some real playing."
1,Never should have been released,One of the most boring big bands I have ever listened to.The arrangements were made for a high school band.The trombone is the only good thing about the album.
4,Better than steel racks,I give this one four stars mainly because the attachment hardware could have been better thought out. The fact that this is a universal basket accounts for the large indentations to allow for the riser on some racks. I would have liked the extra space. But overall this is by far a better choice than a metal basket. Nothing pokes through to damage your machine. I'd buy it again.
4,very cool Album,"this was the first album that introduced me to the Crusaders&I was hooked there after. the title track is still a Banger""Street Life"" with then unknown Randy Crawford on the Hook. Wilton Felder on the Sax,Stix Hooper on the Drums holding it down&at the center of it all is the Genius Playing of Joe Sample on Keyboards.Rodeo Drive&Carnival of the Night&Hustler were my cuts. dug the arrangements,instrumentation&overall feel of this album."
3,Enjoyable and somewhat engaging,"3 1/2An accessible, mildly challenging brief serving of Jazz fusion with some early 80's street funk vibed in for good measure. Although the results still too often feel contrived in an easy-listening-with-edge sort of way, there are still far too many noteworthy elements going on within the interplay to ignore it as a jazz-funk relic."
1,Amazon's taking advantage!!!,"Man, I cannot believe that I can't get the ENTIRE song, 'Streetlife' (11:18) unless I buy the damn album! All I can get is the 'radio' edit? That's trifling. I don't want the album. This is exactly the point of the mp3 format, so that one doesn't HAVE to buy an entire album to get the song they want. DAMN!!!"
5,The BEST Barbara Cartland Novel ... without a doubt!,"I've been a BC fan ever since I was a teenager! But it was not till very recently that I discovered that most of the out-of-print Bantam publications were sold at AMAZON through the market place sellers. I have therefore spent a long time ordering those titles that were missing from my old collection. It's been great! This particular novel is by far my #1 ... I could not put it down for a single minute! the build up of the inevitable ""love"" between both characters was subtle, gradual and totally credible ... so much so, that the romantic-turned-cynic -which is me- totally bought and appreciated the predictable ending with a sigh of pleasure!(Unlike the case in so many of the other titles by the same author where I found myself thinking ... ""WHATttt""?!!! or ""Mehh ... Yeah right""!)Definitely worth reading, having and re-reading when in a cozy, romantic mood!ENJOY!!!!"
1,Horrible,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Maybe if your into rape fantasy it might be your kind if thing. If I didn't pay for it, I would not have finished the movie."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. Definitely not worth it. Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk, Stunk,"
1,Better pass on this one,"I purchased all of the Steppenwolf albums as they were released and found their first two or three albums to be excellent. This one, sporting silly gatefold graphics, embarrasing lyrics, and uninspired musicianship, was the only one that I sold to the local used record shop a few years ago. 'Nuff said"
2,LAME... FOR YOUNGER VIEWERS ONLY,"I AGREE WITH ALL THE REVIEWS OF 1,2, OR 3 STARS. THIS IS LITERALLY JUST GLIMPSES OF NUDE CELEBRITIES; MOST OF WHICH WERE "" BEFORE THEY WERE ANYBODY "" AND SOME NOT NUDE AT ALL. FARRAH FAWCETT- THE FIRST ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE FEATURED DOESNT GET NUDE. AND CANDY SAMPLES, WHO TO MY KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY EVER A PORN STAR. WHO HASNT SEEN HER NUDE? COMPLETE JOKE. IN FAIRNESS- THERE WAS A WINNER OR TWO. SALLY STRUTHERS WHILE SHE WAS STILL THIN COMES TO MIND. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER HAVE SEEN THE MOVIES FROM WHICH THESE CLIPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. AT THE END OF THE DAY- YOU HAFTA DECIDE HOW MUCH YOU WANNA PAY FOR A COLLECTION OF BRIEF GLIMPSES.... AND $19 TO ME IS TOO MUCH. AS WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING ON AMAZON- THE PRICE EVENTUALLY FALLS. WAIT TILL IT DROPS BELOW $10 OR SO AND THEN TAKE A LOOK."
2,same old story,"If you saw any of the movies these clips are from don't waste your money on this video.They make no sense outside of the context of the film and considered next to todays standards (or lack thereof) the ""titallating"" factor is almost non-existent.Apparently our memories become romantically foggy as the years go by and we attribute more to these ""Saucy Revues"" than there really was.My advice is to let your memories remain just that - memories - and don't try to conjure up the past and expect the same results...as a great writer once wrote -""You can't go home again""."
3,deja-vu,"A view from the past, of actresses known for other roles, where some should have stayed sexy in our imaginations."
5,Wolf cards,"I ordered these cards for my daughter, who absolutely loves wolves. They arrived in time for Christmas, and have been used extensively for the last month. They're still holding up in a house full of children, well worth my coulple dollars."
5,You may have to listen to this a couple times..,"When I first listened to this, I was disappointed, but after listening to it a couple times I really started to like it. Rotting Pinata remains their best CD but this comes in a close 2nd. You should get both CDs! But I wouldnt suggest Wax Ecstatic.. big let down, especially after such a great first album. Polyanna and 1000 Times are the best songs on this CD. I'm still disappointed with All American World and Radio Prayer Line, but the other songs make up for it."
3,Beautiful hopelessness indeed,"It was...hmm, brutal. And angry. Beautifully written and profoundly depressing. And it exposed the immense power held by petty officials and their corruption and greed and insecurities. It exposed the horrifying lot of women whatever class they were born into. Worth reading.All well and good, but an entire village void of anyone who can actually ask a rational question or grasp why things are the way they are much less struggle against that? A whole village full of people who cannot see beyond their plows? Not one person even vaguely awake and self-aware? It reminded me of Chekhov's stories of peasants...it reminded me of the dominant paradigm of poor people as stupid and ignorant, which ultimately leads to the idea that poverty is their fault.Were it true, change would be impossible."
3,'We are God's slaves when it's time to say our prayers. But we are the Mayor's slaves all the time',"The god in the title is not a deity but the mayor of a small village where, assisted by his henchmen, he governs with total corruption - forcing young girls to work for him, abusing them and ditching them once pregnant and even committing murder or framing the innocent to remove unwanted people.One family in particular suffers at his hands...Saadawi does a good job at evoking rural life - the heat, the unceasing farm work and also the superstitious beliefs of the people. I was surprised to discover towards the end that it's actually set comparatively recently , just after the Suez/Sinai conflict - it feels as if it's much further back in time.The author tells us this is based on a story she heard in her youth.Quite interesting and well written although the 'angry defiance' that is mentioned in every description of Zakeya became a little repetitive!"
5,Best of the Best,Barry Bonds is one of the best hitters in the game. His records are a testament to that. A great book on a great man and player. There are more goals and records out there to break and he's the man to do it!
3,Not the Best,"This is a nice pot but chips easily. The overall quality is not the best. Defects can be seen on the pot if you look closely, especially on the handles. The pot cooks food well and is a great size when making food for a party. If you plan on buying this pot, be very careful when using it and when cleaning it. It will chip very easily. I only use a wooden spoon when cooking with mine. You should also inspect the pot when you first receive it to make sure you get a pot without defects."
5,a music fan,"The legendary music that accompanies Robin Hood certainly deserves much praise, as composer Michael Kamen created themes that forever exist in our hearts. The films main theme, probably one of the most recognizable in history, remarkably captures much of the adventure-based film's spirit, not to mention the various other themes in Maid Marian, Little John and his Band in the Forrest, and the Abduction and the Final Battle at the Gallows, where Kamen's true abilities are demonstrated. The perfect blend of romance and action is artfully shown in this score, which will certainly remain rather prized for its innovative new instrumentation and orchestration-the basis for much modern film music."
5,Unique--Relaxing!,"With the Celtic-style Classical Music Soundtrack renditions capped off with Bryan Adam's Theme Song, it's a keeper. Also, there was a new song called 'Wild Times' (pretty sure of the name). . . very good song."
4,"Very good, but heavy.",I love Time Atac clips. They are my 2nd pair. This one is a bit heavy but for my home stationary bike they work well. My other MTB has carbon fiver clips and they are great and lighter. 4 starts for being heavy and a bit pricey.
3,Rival Deep Fryer,This is over rated. Not very large capacity. I would spend my money on something larger. However this is great for just a small fryer
3,not bad but..,beautiful picture.. but the size is wicked misleading. It does not include how there are 2-3 inches of white surrounding the photo (much smaller than the 24x32)
3,A Disappointment,"While Macy's writing was exceptional, I found the actual story to be disappointing and redundant. Macy is no doubt a writer who knows New York and its upper classes, however the story failed to capture my soul."
3,a-macy-ing debut!,Stick with this book and you'll be richly rewarded. There are parts of it that seemed to drag on but this Caitlin Macy shows signs of being a superb writer. Two of her characters - George Lenhart and Kate Goodenow are engrossing. The scenes dealing with George's roomate's girlfriend towards the end of the book are worthy of Hitchcock. I recommend this book.
3,The Fundamentals of Melodrama,"The first 200 pages were very well-written: great characterization (particularly of Harry--he was extremely well done) and a very engaging story, albeit a little shallow. The last 100 pages, however, deteriorate into melodramatic twists and turns that simply don't fit the tone of the rest of the book. It was as if Macy said, ""Well, I've drawn this great world, now what shall I do with it? Ho hum, anything should be fine."" I think she has a lot of promise, though, and I look forward to reading other things in the future that she writes."
2,stick with the original,"This book attempted an ambitious feat - to transport ""The Great Gatsby"" to the present day, but the author's reach was higher than her grasp. The characters behaved more like thirtysomethings - and yes, I do know people of the same class in real life, and they definitely do not behave like these characters. Anyway, the characters were for the most part, tissue thin, dull, and/or unlikeable, especially the woman for whom we were supposed to believe most of the males had been carrying a torch for since prep school. Yet, other reviewers have raved over this book, and its ""fine writing"" so maybe it's worth a shot."
2,Disappointing,"Macy is clearly a talented writer, but I couldn't for the life of me understand the motivations of most of the characters. The character of Kate is completely unappealing, and I couldn't understand why men were drawn to her. I would have been much more interested if we could have gotten into her head. I grew up around people like this, and I still couldn't muster up any interest in the characters. A big disappointment."
4,Terrific Read,"I found ""The Fundamentals of Play"" to be a wonderfully exciting book. I had heard tremendous praise and good word about this new novel and had great hopes in reading it. I was very pleased with all aspects of it. I found the characters relatable and interesting, the plot thoughtful and easy to follow, but still interesting and fun to read. The friendships and life experience of the cast of characters keeps this book moving and never dull. I see great promise in Caitlin Macy's work and look forward to more from her in the future."
4,Forget Big Brother -- this is the real stuff,"Fundamentals of Play is a fascinating glimpse of a particular slice of our culture that I didn't know much about, and the bonus is, it's told in flowing prose. Reading it on July 4th got me to thinking about the wonderful variety of people and worlds existing and flourishing in this great country.I also just read a first novel giving a similarly fascinating glimpse of young people living an entirely different but no less fascinating lifestyle here on the West Coast: ""Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf"" by Asher Brauner, and I recommend both these books for your summer reading pleasure."
2,Well written but boring!,I usually enjoy reading a young writers first novel. I found The Fundamentals of Play to be well written but not at all interesting. I could have put the book down half way and never wondered how it turned out. I also believe the Ms. Macy should have had her characters attend Yale not Dartmouth since Yale was her Alma Mater. Her Dartmouth background material was superficial....example no one would leave Dartmouth at the end of the term in a cab. My advice would be to skip this book.
1,The latest bright young thing...,"Much like Melissa Bank's ""Girls Guide to Hunting & Fishing,"" this book simply proves how out of touch the publishing industry has become. Like some other reviewers, I found the dialogue silly and contrived, the characters unbelievable, and the first 50 pages a bore. Granted, I don't know much the lives of the New York super-rich, but how many people do? Seems like rather a limited market. (Of course, I don't know anything about the lives of the British super-rich either, but Richard Mason's ""The Drowning People"" was well-written enough that it didn't matter.) I actually laughed out loud when Cara announced that she was pregnant. Welcome to Plot Convenience Playhouse! Who didn't see this one coming? Personally, I've got to wonder what Macy's MFA classmates--the ones who aren't selling--are writing."
3,"If You Liked ""The Great Gatsby"" Then Read This Book","I tell all my friends who did not read, ""The Great Gatsby,"" to read this book. This is Gatsby set in New York modern day times. I hope that Ms. Macy tips her hat to Fitzgerald while touring or giving interviews.That said, I enjoyed this book. I like the idea of taking an old story and setting it in modern day times (i.e. Jane Smiley's, ""A Thousand Acres,"" or Helen Fielding's, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"", and David James Duncan's, ""The Brothers K"").This is not a happy tale and like, ""The Great Gatsby,"" it is one I think of often."
2,As mediocre as its characters,"Macy is definitely talented at writing narrative, and I look forward to future efforts from her, but this novel left me with all of the emotional and intellectual reaction that I would have from reading a pamphlet in a dentist's office describing a toothbrush. I'd liken The Fundamentals of Play to a written exercise most us probably had in high school - writing a piece in the style of another author, and people rightly compare this work to Fitzgerald and some others. I don't much have a problem with that conceptually, although a unique style is more interesting if it's good, but Macy's characters and themes are uniformly vague and not engaging to the reader. This novel had potential to be better than it is, but the story and its characters needed more dimension."
3,"If You Liked ""The Great Gatsby"" Then Read This Book","I tell all my friends who did not read, ""The Great Gatsby,"" to read this book. This is Gatsby set in New York modern day times. I hope that Ms. Macy tips her hat to Fitzgerald while touring or giving interviews for, ""Fundamentals of Play.""That said, I enjoyed this book. I like the idea of taking an old story and setting it in modern day times (i.e. Jane Smiley's, ""A Thousand Acres,"" or Helen Fielding's, ""Bridget Jones's Diary, and David James Duncan's, ""The Brothers K"").This is not a happy tale and like, ""The Great Gatsby,"" it will leave an impression."
2,Mediocrity Reigns,"Despite the drubbing Ms. Macy recieved from the NYT Book Review, I felt compelled to give this book about the self-absorbed, fading clan of ""wasps"" (that Fitzgerald so lyrically captured decades ago) a chance. Ms. Macy's problem is not as one reviewer puts it her subject matter, but her inability to convey the characters in an interesting way. In literature or in pulp the greatest crime is to bore the reader. Ms. Macy bores to excess. In making vapidity a theme of her characters, she has not invested any ""colorful"" characters to counterbalance. This is the kind of novel that bored wealthy house wives in Connecticut can say they read, but in actuality they will not have gotten past page 10..."
1,a disappointment,I forced myself through the first 75 pages and gave up in disgust. The dialogue doesn't give the reader enough to go on. I found myself continually trying to fill in the blanks. It took too much effort to read this book. The reviews were misleading.
5,Don Chance knows his Derivatives!,"I am just about done with my MBA, and I have to say this is must-have book for the shelf. I read it cover to cover and now I find myself going to it for quick reference. It is really comprehensive and very thorough. The language is not the usual dense ""academese,"" and I am most thankful to have--set forth in three short essays toward the end of the book--the differences in option pricing theory. This is the best overview on option pricing I've read yet."
5,"Fun, lively, upbeat","Nobody makes records like this anymore, and too bad. It's a lot of fun to listen to and sing along with."
5,Buy this disc!!,"Louis Jordan is the king of jump and this set is outstanding. This disc collects most of his greatest sides from the 40's. If you are interested in or jumping on the new swing bandwagon, buy this disc to see where this all started. Of course after listening to Mr. Jordan, you'll see that the current crop of swing bands pale to his greatness."
5,A great light for your child.,"My toddler loves this light. It's a wonderful nightlight and ""calming"" device for a toddler who isn't sure she wants to go to sleep. A variety of changing colors to keep her occupied as she gets sleepy. It shuts itself off after a few minutes so it doesn't run down the batteries. Seems durable, too. If something were to happen to mine I'd replace it immediately--I can't live without it."
3,a reasonal battery,"this might be a good replaced battery. it fit quite well with my camera and does not require long time recharged. However, i am not so much happy because it's life is not long. I can only able to take around 100 pictures with it. I wish if it's life would be longer."
2,What you see is NOT what you get,"I ordered the Canon Bp-511a and I got some cheap brand Bp-511. When I wrote to the company to tell them that the description they posted was not what they sent me, they said that it should still be compatable with my camera. But if I paid for a Canon battery and a Bp-511a then thats what I expect to get, not a cheap compatible verson of it. If you dont care getting the cheap version of what your ordering then go ahead, but dont expect to get what is actually listed."
3,Tourist Mariachi,"Among the fine styles of mariachi music available, this one features ""mellow"" vocals and ""classic"" pieces like ""Guadalajar"", Celito Lindo and so on. Every performance is workmanlike but they all seem ""familiar"". For ""ultimate"" mariachi please look elsewhere: ""The Best Of"" Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitan, Aguilas de Tijuana, Mariachi Cobre or, for up-to-date mariachi music, Banda El Recodo (""Mas Fuerte que Nunca""). Each of these suggestions delivers high-energy mariachi music that repays listening by any Anglo (me) who is ""open"" to an unfamiliar style. I play these suggestions over and over and revisit them periodically."
3,A Mix of several albums,"Engelbert is one of our finest vocalist and this Cd is a compliation of cuts from different albums repackaged and re-titled. The classic Release Me and There Goes My Everything are on here with a mix of Misty Blue and This is My Song. I love ""My World"" because of the range he uses on it and his version of There's a kind of Hush is nice but overall this is a fair mix of some of Engelberts work. A few throwaways are included but that's how they sell CD's when they repackage and re-title them."
5,Great overview,"I was looking for a quick overview of Mexican history in my university's library and found this book. It was exactly what I was looking for. The book is concise, well-written, and interesting. It especially cleared up my misunderstanding about the progression from Independence to Reform to Revolution. I just wish it had more information on contemporary Mexico. The book was copywrited in 1997 so it's almost 10 years old. I would have liked more information on the scandals with Salinas and on the Zapatista rebellion."
4,"I Love Good Plots, Hooray For The Good Old Days","I think I would find a new name for my company ""Sinister Cinema"" does not tell the story for your pictures. They were great, old, rewarding, but not in great shape. I enjoyed them because of the great plots, but they are too expensive for their quality. Try to make better copies and relax a little on the price, or include more movies."
2,waxman faucet,faucet will not fit on flat surface needs a large gasket to mount on sink-- water flows is slow
2,I am still looking for answers!,"I did see the author on CBN and decided to by the interview based on what he had to say. The interviewee called it ""an easy read"". Not true! When I bought the book, I began with my usual skimming and found a wide range of content but nothing that grabbed me or seemed to strike a chord for a middle class American like myself.I enjoyed his prose and the title of the book spells great intent, but I never found what I was looking for....quite a bit of globetrotting...Regretfully, I returned the book. I'll give the author another try in the future."
4,Call to Arms for Truth in American Culture,"Os Guiness, a top quality sociologist, is uniquely gifted at explaining difficult cultural factors in a manner that the general public can grasp. This book is not a comprehensive refutation of postmodern and modern epistemological systems. Rather, it is a critique of our cultural values and practices as a result of the modern and (especially) the postmodern theories of truth. Many of the examples he uses are easy to remember and embody the point he is trying to make (I will never look at Jay Leno the same - you will know what I mean if you read the book). It is not a difficult read, and the case is plainly made for Truth."
3,Delightful!,"I read this book a while ago. The characters were interesting, although towards the end, more could have been done about the hero's experiences. I liked the twist at the end."
1,B.I.C America DV62si,I have 4 DV62si speakers in my suround system. They are the best I have ever had. They sound better then my Old bose life style system by far. Clear with good base. They make my old time rock and roll music come alive. And movies as well. 100 percent happy so far. I have had then for about 3 months so far. And they look great also. Best of all was the price. A steal at about $110.oo a pair. Forgot the 5 stars sorry
5,PAUL LIVES STILL,"THIS ONES FOR THE FANS OF BAD COMPANY/FREE, PAUL WAS THE GUITAR PLAYER IN (FREE) THE BAND THAT WAS TO MORPH INTO (BAD COMPANY) AFTER PAUL'S UNTIMELY AND TRAGIC DEATH, MICK RALPHS FROM (MOTT THE HOOPLE)JOINED BOZ BURRELL, SIMON KIRKE AND PAUL RODGERS WHO WERE BOTH IN FREE WITH PAUL KOSSOFF, TO FORM BAD CO.(BACK STREET CRAWLER) HAS BEEN RE-ISSUED WITH A NEW LOOK GIVING PAUL HIS PROP'S IN TITLE AND COVER. IT SOUNDS GREAT. SIMON KIRKE, PAUL RODGERS, ALAN WHITE. 1973 ROCK OLGA QUIT !WAIT ! WHAT IS THAT ? WAIT WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?... STOP ! HEY ! OUCH !"
4,Some good ideas but missing.....,"As a relative beginner in the world of meditation I found some interesting techniques in this book. However, it lacked specific examples or instructions as to how to impliment the techniques. The book also has a pretty useless section discussing colors and what they say about you. Overall though for the price I think this is a decent book to complement other materials and personal instruction."
3,California's Kit Homes,Opened up something I had never heard about. Interesting piece that helps fill in an important part of the story of kit homes.
1,Buy something else!,"I have installed 2 of these and both have the same bad performance issues. I have to reboot them several times a day because the device loses its connection between it's own wireless interface and it's own wired interface. If your computer connects via the wireless, you will loose access to anything past the device. You can not even ping the device's own IP address. If yoiu reboot it, then it works for a while. I did a little more research and found out that this is a common problem. I am now trying to return them."
2,Picture is not for this item,"The picture shows 2 converted outputs, plus one at input voltage. The delivered item is very different in appearance and has only 1 output."
5,Great Bakeware!!!,This is some of the best bakeware. Never had any problems. When I use them I always put them on a baking sheet. This should prevent the random cracking a couple of other reviewers experienced.
1,CRACK,"This baking dish works very well until it cracks. I see other reviewers had the same problem. Mine lasted two years. For the price, that is not very long."
1,Surprisingly disappointed,"I've used my square stoneware pan maybe 10 times and didn't have any problems. But today my dish just cracked right down the middle while in the oven at 400 degrees, just like the other 1-star reviewer experienced. I did not see this coming. I'm disappointed, but at least I found it at TJ Maxx for $12."
1,Arrived Broken Twice!,"I ordered this item and it arrived broken. I sent it back for a return, and the new one arrived broken again. Amazon needs to do a much better job with the packaging. Especially something as heavy and fragile as this stoneware. It caused more of a headache than what it was worth. I am very dissapointed."
1,Cracked,"I'll start by saying that I own a number of Le Creuset pans and stoneware dishes. I received this particular baking dish as a holiday gift from the in-laws, and as I was washing it after its inaugural casserole I noticed a hairline crack running the entire length of the thing. I called Le Creuset the next morning, explained the situation, and they readily exchanged it for a new one. Unfortunately the replacement developed the same side-to-side crack after I used it last night for the first time!I'm going to talk with my MIL this afternoon to see if she's Okay with simply getting a refund from the manufacturer. This isn't the first Le Creuset stoneware item I've had develop cracks after a one or two uses, and I'm coming to the conclusion that they need to work on their stoneware manufacturing techniques."
1,"Cracked, twice","I ordered this product in June, used it once, and it cracked. I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Today, after 3 uses, the replacement cracked... A huge ""POP POP"" from a 375 degree oven. I pulled it out and yep, it was cracked all the way thru, straight down the middle. I will not use Le Creuset stoneware again."
2,Cracked all the way through in under 6 uses,"I am a huge fan of Le Creuset's cast iron collection, and I was very excited to receive a stoneware 1/4 quart rectangular baking dish by Le Creuset as a gift. However, this dish cracked all the way through within 6 uses, though I take very good care of it both when it is in use and when it is shelved. Based on my experience I would not buy nor recommend Le Creauset stoneware."
1,It Explodes In The Oven!,"Williams-Sonoma is picking up the two last casualties tomorrow. The Le Creuset stonewware is ""oven-safe"". I think not! Thebakeware explodes in the oven leaving you with shards of clay and your special casserole in the bottom of your ovenLe Creuset Stoneware 14""Oval Baking Dish - Cobalt Blue. I was raised on Le Creuset in the 1970s and 1980s. The iron cookware is amazing. I still have many of Mom's 30-year old pieces. The stoneware is dangerous and without quality control. No less than three different sizes have exploded in the oven after 2 to 3 uses. This is a very dangerous product! Buyer beware."
1,Cracked after 1st use,"Don't know what more to say.....Used it for the first time for a stuffed flank steak recipe, 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Pulled it out, and cracked in half. Disappointed."
1,Broken!,"Recently purchased the Le Creuset Stoneware 12 1/2-by-9 1/2 inch Rectangular Baking Dish for my 23 year old daughter for Christmas. As soon as it arrived in the mail, it was in a million pieces! The only protective shipping material used was a sheet of thin plastic and a box! I'm sure the product itself is okay, however we never got a chance to use it! Don't buy online."
5,Great Product,"I absolutely love this Dish. What I find the most appealing, besides the fact that it looks really nice, is that it is incredibly easy to clean. The food and stains will come right off with almost no effort. I definitely recommend it."
1,Incorrect Measurements,"Not As Described. Ordered after searching for a high sided baking dish. Web site claims ""Product Dimensions: 13 x 10.2 x 4 inches"" Actual Dimensions 13 X 10.2 X 2.5 inches. Huge difference. If you are looking for a high sided baking dish this is not the one."
1,Thailand Junk,Don't buy Le Cresuset stoneware it is Thailand junk. Used ours about six times until it cracked for no reason. From what I see Le Creuset does not stand behind their crap product. Le Creuset is laughing all the way to the bank on this caper.
1,It broke the first time I used it!,"I received this as a wedding gift, and was excited to use it to broil salmon. Unfortunately, it broke into three pieces in the oven the first time I used it. I recommend NOT purchasing this baking dish."
1,Bait and Switch,"Originally recommended by Chez Pim, this Le Creuset baking dish was described as being 4 inches high on Amazon. The dish I received and returned and then received and returned a second time was only 2.5 inches tall (actually the second dish was improperly packed and arrived broken).Amazon did not try to replace the dish that I ordered, but continued to substitute the shorter baking dish. It seemed that Customer Service did not understand the difference between the 2 products.Ultimately I purchased an oval baking dish from Le Creuset through Amazon."
2,Missing several songs from the movie...,"Several songs are missing. Aero Smith, Main Theme, and the song when Ace discovers Einhorn is Finkle."
2,Vocabulary AND Politics,"In my work teaching ESL, I have had the opportunity to use this book (it is available at the center where I teach). The vocabulary is OK, but beware using the book if your students are from countries in which ""democratic"" values are not universally shared. The written examples take for granted that the learners share the redistributionist ethic of England, where the book is published.This otherwise praiseworthy book is marred by the failure of the author(s) to take into account that not everyone grew up in -- or shares the values of -- England."
3,"Very good book, a shame the CD","The book is very useful, but the CD doesn't work.Thinking of a problem with my copy, I tried replacing it with amazon (very quick!) but the new one has the same problem, the system to protect it, doesn't allow it to run.Anyway I keep the book and I am going to try contact McGraw & Hill to see if they have any solution!"
5,"Swing it, Shelby!","If you came late to Shelby, and you're looking for more of the harsh, changeable, sublime stuff you found on ""I am Shelby Lynne,"" you owe it to yourself to check out Shelby in an earlier incarnation. I have them all, but this is my favorite. It's also nothing like her most recent work. This CD features a full-on swing orchestra with steel guitars and fiddles, and Shelby's great big alto booming out over impeccable instrumentation. Get it while you can, because if you love her voice, you'll never hear it featured more beautifully than in these arrangements."
2,Very boring - Professors view about marriage.,"The author bombards the reader with non-stop analytical data for common aspects like personalities. People can be emished or distant and in the middle is differential which is having emished and distant personalities... really.. is that what in the middle means. Then they do graphs that if you couldn't already figure out what they meant after 10 - 15 pages on one subject then you should just give up. Another thing that the author does that is upsetting is that they try and sound super sophisticated by using words that I have never heard of all the time. Literally I have to have dictionary.com up in order to follow along. If this wasn’t for a college class, I would never have purchased this book."
1,BAD THEOLOGY,The authors support replacing scripture with inclusive language. They ARE NOT MAINSTREAM they are LEFTIST! I went through this book with a fine tooth comb for school it is bad! I would only recommend it to someone who wants a bad example of scholarship for a reference.
2,Ridiculous,"No one needs a cookbook to explain that they can go to a delicatessen and pick up a few things for dinner instead of ordering out for pizza. It's a wonder that any publisher ever conceived of, much less published this book.Even before Whole Foods and Fresh Direct made it possible to serve elegant dinners without much cooking, this book was useless to all except those individuals useless in the kitchen.And half the book seems wasted on instructions like ""assemble all the ingredients before you start cooking."" Um, duh.Nevertheless, I give this book two stars for its including several complete assorted menus. Sometimes, concocting new ideas of what to serve together in one meal is the hardest part."
2,J. Buckley,The book was in very good shape but I do feel completely ripped off from this purchase. Apparently this book comes with a companion CD as illustrated in the book and this purchase did not come with one. Yet they still wanted to charge me full price for this book. I thought I would help other retailers by buying my textbooks outside of the university bookstore and saving myself some money. From this experience I think I am going to stick with the university bookstore for my textbooks.
1,Not written for the real world...,"The advice in this book sounds very nice and gentle and compassionate but the problem is that it works only on children who are obedient and fairly submissive by nature. Lots of kids figure out the game after a while. What if your child refuses to stay in ""time out""? What happens when you have taken away all the privileges? (and little kids just don't have that many). What about older kids who just laugh at this kind of approach?You'd better go buy another book because Dr. Brazelton doesn't address real discipline problems."
4,Discipline is Teaching,"This book has a lot of good information. It has helped me to redefine what discipline is. As it says in the Introduction, ""Discipline is Teaching""This is the theme that runs through the book, and it is mentioned many times, but the book does not come out and hit you with it. I had to extract this most important general lesson through a lot of contemplation while reading.Many times throughout the book, I crossed out the word ""Discipline"" and wrote ""lesson"" or ""teaching"" and it makes much more sense that way.What are the lessons? We are teaching children a system of fair rules and the positive and negative consequences for following them or not. This leads to self-control, self-regulation. Self-discipline is the goal of discipline.This book challenges us:""To raise a morally developing, emotionally competent child will ultimately be more rewarding than simply an obedient one."""
3,Not really impressed,"This should be called a brochure and not a book. It is very light, basic and not too helpful. I love Brazelton but this isn't one of my favorites by him."
5,not happy,well the truth for me is it was not leaking at all my porblem was that only one came and it saaid a case of ten so i will have to go and buy some from the store which suks cuz i wasted 40 something for 10 and only got one i hope to get my money back
2,Cute model,"The fuselage on this model went together with just a little effort to line up the body parts. There arent any pin/hole to asist with alignment so it was a matter of slide and hold and pray it stays aligned. Got a lot of glue on my fingers. The motor, motor mounting frame and upper and lower cowlings were another story. The alignment was terrible and after mounting the engine, the cowlings didn't fit properly. Just about all the engine parts were slide and stick. The upper engine cowling is supposed to be unglued to display the engine. The alignment was so bad I filed away some of the cowling and glued it in place. The assembly instructions were lousy. The best I can say was that the parts identification was great. Drawings with lines pointing to where parts mate were useless for the most part. One final Oh, oh.. the registration number (on the decals) belongs to a Beechcraft (seriously)!In all due fairness, this is a small model and it's size alone prohibits a lot of assembly detail."
4,Pretty Good,"This is one of the better videos I've seen on Escrima. Griffins nails down the basics very well, especially blocks and counters. The practice drills will be useful no matter what level of training your at. Although Griffins is a member of the ""Dog Brothers"", I found his teaching method to be better than the series you can buy straight from DBMA"
2,Not as advertised!,"At the time I ordered the Expressions from Stiffel Empire Bronze Collection, Set of 3 - the product description stated:Floor Lamp: Requires one 3-way 150 watt light bulb Table lamps: Each require one 3-way 150 watt light bulb.What I got was 2 table lamps and 1 floor lamp that each take a 3-way 100 watt light bulb. If you want to use these as reading lamps, as I did, you might want to look elsewhere!"
4,"Cookbook, the best",I think that MAurice Moore Betty should be commemorated for such a great book. It has every recipe that you can find and it has a school to go with it. If you love to cook than get this book. Kids love it too
5,A must read!,This book is must reading for every red blooded Italian-American! It hits home with truth and wittiness that will make you laugh til' you cry. To read Fante is to love him.
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT,"I read this book in a matter of hours and John Fante has quickly become one of my favorites!!!! He is funny, he is crude, he is awesome. It is the story of a disfunctional family coming to terms with their disfunctionality. The father is a drunk. The mother is devoted. The children hate both of them. A great story!"

4,Beyond Cornucopia Kids,"The content of the book is excellent. The author gives practical and easy to follow instructions to parents on how to raise responsible children and avoid ""spoiling"" them. Very appropriate for the times when children want name-brands and expect expensive items to be given to them. Baldwin covers the reasons parents fall into this trap and gives seven ""hidden"" secrets of how to get out of this parenting trap. The format is easy to read, almost in outline form. Chapters 1 and 2 are the skeleton of the information and the rest of the chapters are an elaboration. I would recommend the first two chapters for every parent in America!"
1,watch,"This was supposed to be a new watch. It came in a dirty, used container. The clasp broke within a week. Complete junk."
5,Excellent,"I passed my CLEP Spanish exam because of this book. It's thorough, well organized and effective. The practice exams were very close to the real thing.The book also includes audio CD's which are essential to preparing for the listening portion of the exam. I would not take a CLEP test without this guide."
2,Clep Spanish is missing CD # 2,"I was excited to recieve the Clep Spanish book, once I opened it and saw the back of the book were two cd's should be, only one cd came with the book. I was jipped from the price that I paid for the book when it claimed it came with two cd's (cd 1 and cd 2. unhappy buyer).CLEP Spanish W/ Audio CDs (Rea)- The Best Test Prep for the CLEP Exam [CLEP SPANISH W/AUDIO CDS (REA)]"
2,not very good,This book does a poor job of explaining the use of spanish grammar. I was disappointed.
1,Never received it!!!,"I'm sure the item is fine, but I have yet to receive it and it's been over a month. Very disappointed."
4,Good source for study. Very close to the real tests.,"I tested for the 12 credit exam and passed with a very high score (had to in order to get the 12 credits).The material was very close to the actual test. Some of the pronunciation quizzes had a harsh accent, but it wasn't a problem to understand the conversations. It was very useful to practice with the preparation tests that came in the CDs."
3,Fair But Full of Errors,"I got this book as a study guide to use along side personal lessons I was taking to prepare for the test. Both my professor and I found numerous mistakes in the grammer in both the written and spoken parts of the test, as well as several mistakes in the prep areas. Also, the person who wrote this book is clearly not a native spanish speaker, for in many places they use idioms that are very american, and its clear that their english grammer peeks on more than one occasion.None the less, the book wasn't entirely usless, it did help. I wouldn't call it the BEST review for the test, but it atleast does provide some clue as to what the test will be like.If you can find another book for the same price that comes with audio, get it instead."
1,Missing CDs,"I just got the book in the mail, and the audio CD's are missing. So that is a bummer. Un bummero. I'm not sure if that's the correct translation, because I don't have the CD's."
4,A must for CLEP Spanish takers,"If you are planning on taking the Spanish CLEP, then you definitely need to purchase this book. I used it as my main text studying for the CLEP. I will say the sections could be organized better. Sometimes I felt the content was random. Nevertheless, the practice tests make it invaluable. I just took my CLEP test today and passed! My official score on the real test was an average of my score on the practice tests from this book. I didn't even complete the whole book either. I maybe studied half the book and just focused on expanding my vocabulary once I had the basics down.I also highly recommend a verb book, such as Barrons 501 Spanish verbs. I also studied out of this book to get a strong verb base and study the conjugation of the most common verbs.Together these resources are a recipe for success!"
1,Don't do business with Bargaincell!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
1,"I AGREE, THE WORST MAYBE....","I am a Reba fan but this release should have been kept in the vaults. What a disappointment. I thought the CD would have grown on me after a while but I can't get past the title cut. I have listened to the other songs but they are so loud and foppish that I have to turn the stereo off!! Oh, the pain, the pain of this one!"
1,I'M IN AGREEMENT,"Am I glad I am not the only one who sees this CD for the travesty that it is. I only like ""Rumor Has It"" the title track. The rest of it can go to the recycle bin and be deleted forever!!"
1,OUCH!!!,"The title track, ""Rumor Has It"" is as good as any of Reba's early traditional stuff. It is truly a good listen in every way. But the rest of it.....OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best of all time!!,"Reba does an excellent job on this album. My favorite, of course, is Bobbie Gentry's Fancy. Reba does an excellent job of portraying ""Fancy."" Like all of her albums, Reba has songs on here that will both rip your heart out and then make you smile with wonderful memories. Many people do not like her music of the 90s because it isn't ""country"" enough. If you are a true Reba McEntire fan, you will appreciate whatever she sings. She has a unique style that no one has been able to imitate thus far. The Rumor Has It album is a MUST for any Reba fan. She has and continues to do very well with her God-given talents. Thanks for blessing us with those gifts Reba McEntire!"
2,TYPICAL POP STUFF EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST TWO SONGS,"If you like pop music you'll like this. It isn't for me though. I like the first two songs on here but beyond that, ya'll can have the rest of them."
1,I HATE TO DO THIS BUT,"I have to give Reba only one star for this album. ""Rumor Has It"" is a good song, good as any she's ever done. But the rest of it is something I just can't listen to. The worst song on here, I think is ""That's All She Wrote"" but they're all really bad except for ""Now You Tell Me"" which is good. I hate ""You Lie"". Maybe a little bit better production would have helped this. They tried to make it sound too much like pop music and Reba is country through and through. But the tunes to the songs are what I can't take. The words are o.k."
1,ONE OF THE WORST CDS REBA HAS EVER PUT OUT!!,"I am a Reba fan but I love her old stuff. This CD has only three notable songs on it. The title track (an excellent tune), You Lie (also very, very fine) and ""I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain"" (great)! The rest is just filler. Whatever possessed her to record some of the ""ugliest"" songs ever written is beyond me. ""Waitin For the Deal to Go Down"" is horrible. ""Fancy"" is wretched beyond belief.....""This Picture"" and the rest are just about as low as one can get. I look for a good catchy melody when I hear a song and a song with a good hook. There is nothing, absolutely nothing redeeming about this CD other than the three songs I noted. It is possible that this is the worst that Reba has ever put out!! I hate this CD!!"
1,"I AGREE, THE MAIN REASON FOR THE BUBBLEGUM BOOM!!","Reba did set a trend. She has always been a trend setter. She took ""traditional"" country back to its roots, then abandoned it for malarky like this. Indeed, I agree, she set the trend for the bubblegum country boom. Only one of the songs on here is any good and that is the title track. You can have the Paula Abdul, Britney Spears, Pat Benatar songs like ""You Lie"" and that God awful ""Fancy""...one of the worst songs in the history of musicdom. This CD is for Reba devotees only and it is on sale at Amazon used sellers for nickels and dimes because thats all its worth."
1,A DISASTER,"I loved Reba's Traditional Country. When she ventured out of her league to 'do what sells' each album became worse...with the exception of the outstanding ""For My Broken Heart"". This album's only redeeming song is the title track.When I bought this album I never dreamed it would be one of the last by her that I would by. This CD is strictly for Reba fans who love her no matter how mediocre the material she puts out.A horrible disappointment for me who loves 'traditional' Reba.What a waste of MY money!!"
1,OH MAN HOW I HATE THIS FLUFF!!!,"The first song ""Climb that Mountain High"" is o.k. It promised to be a good traditional CD. The next cut ""Rumor Has It"", the title track was even better and I thought...oh boy...she's come back!! Then I heard the rest of it and got madder and madder as each song got worse and worse!!! And when I heard her do ""Fancy""....I almost threw the CD in the garbage!! I can't understand why anyone would record such an ugly song!!"
1,FANCY RUINED THIS CD FOR ME,"Not that the rest of it is much better. I really never like ""You Lie""...its too pop sounding for me and just another excuse for Reba to overdo things the way she likes to do sometimes. The best songs are those in which she doesn't resort to vocal pyrotechnics. Sadly, this CD is lacking in those kind of songs. This is one of my least favorite CDs and I have to go with the majority of reviewers on this one. I know many who stopped listening to Reba after she recorded this one. But it didn't hurt her in the least because she has a huge fan base."
1,I Gave Up On Reba After This,"The first two tracks held promise. Then it fell apart. And when I heard ""Fancy"" I said...""that's it. No more. I'm never buying another Reba CD"". Well never say never as the saying goes and I recently came across a bunch of her CDs at a yard sale for a quarter a piece and I bought them. I should have left them alone."
1,REBA HIT BOTTOM WITH THIS ONE,"Anyone who would record an atrocity like ""Fancy"" and ruin an entire album by including this song on it deserves zero stars. I did not like this one bit. As a matter of fact, not even the title song ""Rumor Has It"" appealed to me. Look for better Reba albums somewhere else because she hit the bottom with this one."
1,ANOTHER BAD ONE FROM REBA,"Sometimes she does good, sometimes bad. But it seems that most of the albums Reba put out during the nineties are in the latter category. This one has to be one of the worst sampling of tunes I've ever heard. I guess I just got too used to Reba doing traditional country music that I was so disappointed when she started doing all this jiffy pop nonsense! I loathe this CD!!"
5,One of Reba's Finest Works,"This album is one of the best albums I have of Reba's (I own all of them). From the fast pace ""Climb that Mountain High"" to the heart wrencing ""Fallin Out of Love"", this album is an emotional roller coaster ride! My favorite tracks have to be ""Fancy"" and ""You Remeber Me"" as they have such a strong message in them. Buy the album and see for yourself you won't be disappointed!"
1,"OH, I WOULD SAY IT WAS HER WORST!!!","Reba went wild with her oversinging on this one and the results were the worst she's ever done. I can't imagine anything being so bad. A lot of her later albums at least contained material that made up for her ""caterwauling multi-phrasing of notes"" but the material here is so bad (mostly wordy songs with bad melodies) that I guess she just had to overcompensate by extending her notes!!"
1,I TOTAL AGREE...QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST OF REBA!,"O.K., maybe saying its the worst of Reba is carrying it a little too far. THe title track is reminiscent of her ""traditional"" phase which I prefer to the ""awful"" music she has been making since. This CD fails on all counts!"
1,STRICTLY FOR MCENTIRE FANS,"Given that this is one of my least favorite Reba albums all I will say is that it is strictly for her die-hard fans who will buy anything...even bad stuff like this. Reba sounds like a cat in pain on most of the songs on here. An example is on ""Waiting for the Deal to Go Down"".....on down...she sings daaaawwuuunnnn until it drags on to infinity. Really bad."
1,ITS NOT HER WORST BUT IT IS PRETTY BAD,"The one redeeming song on here, actually two, are the title track and the beautiful ballad ""Now You Tell Me"". The rest of this CD is for die-hard Reba fans only. To call this one a masterpiece???????? Come on now you've got to be kidding?????"
1,TOP FIVE OF HER WORST,"I don't know which of Reba's albums has the distinction of being her worst but ""Rumor Has It"" surely has to be in the top five. The CD is loud, overproduced and the vocals are so full of Reba's ""curlicued"" notes that they are a distraction and mar the songs most of which are below her standard. This is a wasted effort and I can't understand the five star ratings she has received for this because in my opinion, it is one of her worst offerings."
5,"No rumor, it's true, it's a great cd!","Reba McEntire's 1990 album RUMOR HAS IT is a nice collection of songs. It opens with the inspiring uptempo song ""Climb That Mountain High"". The title track is one of her best ballads, she sings it so well with so much emotion. She kills ""You Lie"", which also stands as one of her best ballads. Of course there is also the breakthrough single, her version of ""Fancy"", a song about a young girl who is put into prostitution to keep the family from poverty. ""Fallin Out of Love"" is a pleasant ballad, and same goes for ""You Remember Me"". There's some nice uptempo songs here like ""Waiting For The Deal To Go Down"", ""This Picture"", and ""Now You Tell Me"". This is a great CD overall, she didn't disapoint at all."
4,I think this is a good album,"I disliked two songs on this album. The rest were really good. ""This Picture"" ""Climb that mountain high"" ""You Lie"" ""Rumor Has it"" I liked almost every track except the last one."
1,I thought this book was boring.,It was about a boy and his family. The last chapter was good but you have to read the whole story to get to the last chapter. It's not worth it. I do not recomend it.
5,best book for ketogenic diets,a must read for persons suffering with epilepsy. follow the diets and results are great. every one should not expect the same results. always consult with doctor before starting this diet.
4,regarding seizures,brings to the forefront a non-pharmacuetical treatment option for seizures that also does not promise a cure for everyone. It states the facts and lets the reader decide which direction to take.
2,Pretty complex,"It is so technical, and I was looking really for a very-low-carb diet book! It is just a lot more than I was looking for."
2,wrong book.,It had nothing to with diets for cancer. I sent it back. because I was looking for a diet for my wife who has cancer.
2,Disapointed,This book was of no help to me. Not what I was looking for. Not quite as represented by a show on TV. So this will be donated to my local library. I'm sure it could be of help to others.
5,excelent,"This book don't exist here in my country. I really want to know if some editorial (publishing house) import this book about epilepsy diet, but in spanish. A friend of mine got 4 children, the two men got epilepsy. She go to USA every year for different kind of treatments, but the ketogenic diet is really new for us. Please try to help me. Sincerily, Claudia Cortez"
5,The Ketogenic Diet: A Treatment for Children and Others with Epilepsy,"I bought this book for my daughter who has a child with epilepsy. It was very imformative and helpful. Reading the case histories and the mistakes that were inadvertently made, diet-wise, helped us lookout for the same pitfalls. I would highly recommend this book."
2,For managers NOT developers,"This book spends less than 70 pages talking about ARX, most of it is dedicated to the history of programming. If your a developer get the Programming ARX book, and get a membership to the AutoCAD's developer network."
5,3 in 1,So versatile. Very well made will last a long time. Made with high grade silicone & easy to clean. Can be used with or with out the vibe. Can also be used with the suction cup from Tantus. That makes it 3 in 1. The ridges create a very nice sensation in the clit area. The vibe is low to med. I liked it so much I thought I would try some of the other ones from Tantus. Recommend the G-spot one as well for variety. I got this one as a gift with the suction cup. One of the best gifts ever.
2,Initial D,I thought this was the complete Initial D series but it's not. Was very disappointed. I ended up buying the Funimations Initial D S.A.V.E complete series for the same price.
4,Initial D Boxed Set - Limited Edition (Vols. 1-5),Initial D is uber coolbeans even if the animation really sucksI whole drafting experience on screen is like you are thereit kicks ass man! I really love the extras as well!
2,Doesn't stay closed,"Initially I was impressed with the watch...seemed a good deal for the low price...watch looks nice...works fine...the compass seems to work fine. However, after opening the watch to look at the compass a few times over a few days...the latch that holds the watch closed gets a bit loose. So I find myself having to re-close the watch on a regular basis if I move my arms a bit too much.So I guess you get what you pay for..."
2,Avalon watch,"Avalon Mens All Terrain Rugged Hiker Series Watch with Compass*I added this to my growing watch collection, the price was right, it looked attractive.First, I had to add glue shut the ever swinging base that exposes the inaccurate compass.It is still attractive, I wear it about one day per week, but that diminishing and it's slidingdown my favorites list."
2,"Not spray, it is squirt","I was looking for a sunblock spray and found this product. It turned out to be a squirt, not a misty spray like you find in other products. After it squirts on, you have to rub it in to the skin. If you are a golfer like me, this is not a good product."
3,"isn't really a ""spray"", but has good protection","I've seen other spray sunblocks that actually spray on, but you really can't use this as a spray on sunblock... The sunblock is just the standard white lotion and it just comes out in a white spatter that you have to rub on."
4,An Auspicous Beginning,"Why dig this record?? Well, if you're into Bowie, into Idol (Check the ""Thin White Duke""-ish baritone vocals...) , and have a sweet tooth for slightly over-produced non-metal 80's hard rock , this cd's for you. Most of us know Charlie plays lead guitar for Bob Dylan now..what most people don't know is when he signed to MCA for this album in the mid-80's he was paid the most ever for an ""unknown"" (millions) and he was only 17. Sexton became a victim of what mainly the critics attacked him with...he was a ""HYPE"". But listen to this record today and you'll know....the talent is considerable....the songs are for real, and the soul is THERE. Dylan was already a fan before the record was released (Check out ""Biograph"" liner notes). Too bad the critics /cynics put the lights out on this one before Charlie got the chance he deserved....A+++++"
3,it depends on you,"If you're a fan of all that Sexton had done before this,(and after): virtuoso sideman guitar in his own high-energy version of a rootsy style, this cd will sound like different person. Fans of British pop-rock might like it, but I'm of the first persuasion, and I'm guessing that so is Sexton, as he abandoned this persona shortly afterwards."
5,YOUR FAMILY WILL LOVE THIS!,This is the best dishwashing soap out there. I've shown this product to many of my friends - and they love it too! Dawn was not kidding about the direct foaming action. This soap got three week baked on cookie dough off a pan. Forget the long wait time for soaking items with this soap. This soap kicks grease in the butt! Way to go Dawn!
4,"MICHEL DEVILLE, OPUS 15","***1/2 1974. Directed by Michel Deville. A petty bank clerk (Trintignant), is turned into a social climber under the guidance of a Machiavellian writer (Cassel). I really enjoyed this tale about a modern Rastignac who uses women to achieve power and wealth. Michel Deville is certainly a director worth your attention who deserves to be rediscovered while he's still working and alive."
4,Way Cool Pop w. some Indie Rock bite,"I agree with the Amazon review-- a very nice album, & a step forward from the first IMO. The songs are deceptively simple-- really a lot of thought & some clever internal rhyming go on, & pretty good mix of sounds, though she might've fleshed out the accompaniment just a bit. Anyway though clever, infectiously interesting pop with folk & rock elements."
5,Why should you read our rating review?,"...simple: when selecting books to be given the honor of""EDITOR'S CHOICE"" ..., wedo a little research.First, we selected several typical questions from theGoLive mailing list. Then we chose the key words fromthe readers' questions, and looked them up in the indexto the book.Now we judge the book on how quickly we get the answerto the question, how many pages it took us to get a solutionthat would solve the readers' questions, and how clearlywe could institute the directions in the actual GoLiveprogram, on a real web site.Deborah's book got ALL TEN QUESTIONS within 2 pages,and all implementations were in place within minutes.The other top 5 GoLive books took at least 3 pages ofstudy to get to the solutions, and, believe it or not, 2 ofthe books could not answer the questions at all!We give GoLive Bible by Deborah Shadovitz top ratings, and the Editor's Choice Award for December, 2001 in the Designers Bookshelf."
2,Poor,"Usually Bible software books are pretty complete and extremely informative. However, they dropped the ball on this one. Golive Bible is as helpful as the manual that comes with the software. They both are poorly written with incomplete steps to solve or do things with Golive. When I often found myself using both."
5,"TK421, why aren't you at your post?","The Vintage Original Trilogy Collection (VOTC) Stroomtrooper is outstanding! Without a doubt there is no fair comparison to any other Stormtrooper figure done, except the ""super poseable"" clonetrooper from 2003.The VOTC Stormtrooper is the second best figure in the entire vintage series, second only to Boba Fett which is even more impressive! The mold for the VOTC Stormtrooper is perfect, and the articulation can only be compared to 12"" action figures. It's a true work of art and represents the definitive Stormtrooper action figure!I highly recommend the entire 12 VOTC action figures, especially for collectors, but the Stormtrooper is one of the best figures in this outstanding series! Many reviewers question the value of these figures compared to ""basic"" figures. They are definitely worth the price and are bound to be classics! An absolute must for any Star Wars collection!"
3,"Cool, but slightly discolored.","The figure is very cool and poseable. It can be moved in many more positions than the Luke Skywalker Stormtrooper I have. However, the torso is noticeably discolored. It has a yellow tint that can actually be seen in the customer image by Sandy. Sad to say it could have been perfect..."
1,Buyer beware: shipping snafus ahead...,"This series is a great way for non-die-hard collectors to get something close to the origninal packaging. It sure would be nice to be able to buy this... After ordering this item from amazon, Toys R Us failed to deliver it to me. What makes this interesting is that this ""undeliverable"" mail was so undeliverable that it didn't even bother to spawn any of those ""1ST/2ND/3RD DELIVERY ATTEMPT NOTICES."" Now, like any other TRU action figure, it has gone OOP.A great figure, from what I have seen of it. It sure would have been nice to have been able to order it..."
2,Stopped working for me-,"After 6 months of use, it stopped working for me. I thought maybe they changed the ingrediants but not sure. Very disappointed because it gave me great IBS relief. Not sure what to do now."
4,This really works!,"I noticed a difference in my IBS symptoms within a week after starting this product. I take 1 pill each day, and 1 more later in the day if needed. I find that I do best taking it before dinner, as that meal is most likely to bother me."
1,Unfortunately Not For Me,"Digestive Advantage just didn't seem to have any impact on me. It certainly didn't make anything worse, and I assume the probiotics in contains must have done some good, but it just wasn't the IBS solution I had hoped for.However, if you're a fellow IBS sufferer and desperate for a solution, give it a shot! (I'm seeing plenty of good reviews out there-- it must just depend on the person)"
5,Great Stuff!,"This product has totally changed my husband's life. He could barely eat anything at all without having IBS symptoms. Now after using this product for 6 months, he can eat almost anything with very little problem."
5,RELIEF AT LAST!,"I read about this in Dr. Gott's column. I have tried everything else, so I decided what the heck, I might as well try this too. The change has been amazing! No more pain, bloating, constipation...it's all gone. I occasionally will still have minor trouble, but I've found that just taking a second dose that day takes care of the problem. My mother also had these problems and has had the same success.If you suffer from IBS do yourself a huge favor and try this today!!"
5,Adult probiotic,"This product was recommended by my Gastroenterologist and I've been buying it at a local drugstore for nearly a year. I was surfing Amazon and found that they were offering it at an excellent price. I have nothing negative to say, infact, thanks to Amazon, I've been saving a lot of money for the same product. Thanks"
2,Did not work for me,I took these pills every day for 2 months and did not notice any difference. I don't doubt that this works for some people but unfortunately it did not work for me
4,Wonderful Product,"This product really works. Granted, it's not the perfect fix to IBS, it does work to take the major cramping and bloating away. I use this as a secondary product, the first being a prescription from my doctor. I take it once a day with my other medicine and it seems to work for most of the day. It states you can take it up to twice a day and sometimes I do, but for the most part, I use it once a day!"
4,Picks up where the others left off...,"-Good stuff: fills in the gap left over after the usuals (tums, gas-x simethicone, pepcid-ac, zantac, citrucel, etc)... My UC/IC/IBD (Ulcerative Colitis, Ischemic Colitis, Irritable Bowel Disease, +lower-gut-spasms, etc) were initially controlled by ""the usuals"" quite nicely for a good number of years, but then I started getting very painful bloating/gas breakthrough, and none of the ""usuals"" were helping. This stuff seems to do the trick (but since it takes a while to work, hard to tell for sure), as I almost never have any gut problems anymore, no matter what I eat (super-spicy!), drink (beer+mixed) or do. Highly recommend."
5,I.B.S.,"This product has helped me the best! I've tried other over the counter, and this by far has worked at keeping my I.B.S. under control. What ever you do don't run out!!!"
4,works,Hard to believe but this actually seems to work. Only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I have only been on it a week so I am not sure about its long term effectiveness.
3,Caution: NOT Gluten-Free,"Unfortunately, I took one of these capsules and THEN saw the ""Contains wheat and soy"" warning on the label. I have celiac disease, so I just did myself more harm than good by taking this. I'm sure it's a fine product for those of you who can eat wheat and soy, but the gluten- and soy-sensitive should proceed with more caution than I did."
1,Does not work,"Tried this product for a month now and no improvement for IBS. Very disappointed, as I was hoping something out there would work for me. I guess I will go onto to the next product that claims a miracle!"
4,works for me,i have irritable bowel syndrome. These pills work to moderate the extremes of constipation and loose stools if you take them every day. Buying them in 96 count capsules is both more economical and efficient.
5,ibs help at last,"has helped my IBS more than any other thing, have tried prescription drugs and other OTC aids to no avail, this seems to help better than anything. i never realized it was carbs i couldn't digest."
5,Great for Ulcerative Colitis/IBS,"For the last few months, I have had mostly nightly bloating due to my Ulcerative Colitis and perhaps IBS as well. Sometimes the bloating would be very intense and painful. Now that I've been on this medication for about three weeks, I hardly get any bloating at all which is the main reason I tried this product. I believe it took a little over a week to start working. I can't recommend this highly enough. I honestly don't know why my gastroenterologist didn't mention this... Don't think I can live comfortably without this anymore."
2,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this product with very high hopes given all the positive reviews, but unfortunately it did absolutely nothing to help my IBS-D. I took 2 capsules a day for a month and a half and saw no changes whatsoever. I've moved on to other things that are helping me quite a bit better. I know the majority of the reviews on this product are positive, so if you struggle with digestive problems, chances are very good that you will see results. Just thought I'd comment to let people know that this isn't a miracle drug for everyone. Hope it works out for you. Sucks to be in the minority on this, I'd like to have had it work for me :-P"
1,I wish I could get my money back,"I was very optimistic when I first got the product, however, it doesn't work for me, and as many people pointed out, the new formula is actually making their symptoms even worse.I've been taking this product for more than a month, and sometimes my diarrea got even worse.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
2,Different,"I have used Digestive Advantage IBS for years. Buying it at the local stores & I love it!!!!! So, I was so happy to find it at Amazon cheap & w/ free S&H if you picked the auto ship method. When I received my order I knew the pills looked different than the pills I had been purchasing from the store. I just figured they had the new pills, I had seen on the box. I have been taking these pills for over a month & I noticed my symptoms have returned. On 03/09/08 I decided to buy some from the local store & compare the ingredients & they are different. So on 03/10/08 I canceled my auto ship."
2,Not Impressed,"I switched from another brand of probiotic to Digestive Advantage, and I noticed an increase in my IBS symptoms within a few days. I increased my dose of Digestive Advantage to 2 pills per day, and I still had increased IBS complications. I'm not impressed in the least, and unfortunately, I won't even finish the box I purchased. Maybe this brand works well for others, but it did not work for me. I've had better luck with Activia yogurt and Align probiotics."
5,satisfied with product,I was very satisfied with the product and also with the other products offered on the web site. Thank you.
2,did nothing for me,"My problem was mainly diarrhea, without warning, occasional stomach upset.My mother had similar system. I self-diagnosed as IBS and tried this product, to no effect whatsoever. To be fair, I've figured out that I'm wheat/glutenintolerant, and going gluten-free and taking digestive enzymes and probiotichave resolved the problem almost completely."
4,Good product,This product seems to help relieve some of my son's painful IBS symptoms. He doesn't have the horrible stomach pains that he was having.
4,"Worth re-ordering, and I plan to..","I have been taking many steps to relieve my IBS, which I understand is relatively mild compared to others. Since I started taking this once a day, along with acidophulis and watching my eating habits, I have seen a big improvement. If you are feeling bad, it's worth a try."
5,No more anxiety and stress!,If you are reading these reviews -you are fed up and looking for an answer. This stuff works great! I have been taking this for aboout 3 months and it has changed my outlook! It has almost completely stopped my episodes. The very few I do have are completely managable. I can eat and drink anything I want. The best thing is that I no longer have the stress and anxiety that IBS caused. I now can attend an event and not have to leave in the middle. When I go out I don't have to worry about where the restrooms are. I don't worry about what I've eaten- I have my life back!!! Try this what do you have to loose?
5,Excellent product,"After taking this products for 3-4 weeks, my condition improved. (I also took calcrate plus). I do believe this product improved the functions of my intestines."
4,"works well, better if you also use their lactose intolerence pill","this is a good product, I did not have good results with prescription medication for ibs, this works better, is less expensive and no prescription is needed, I added the lactose intolerance pills after getting a free sample in the mail and the combination keeps me almost symptom free (my symptoms were moderate to severe)"
4,Digestive Advantage IBS,"I was very happy to learn about this product from a column in our local paper. A number of people had wrote and asked about it, so I thought it was worth trying. I am happy to say that it has helped with a lot of my symptoms, I am not completely symptom free, but it has helped with the frequency of my attacks, and I will definitely continue taking it, it is worth the money for anyone who is bothered with IBS."
5,IBS pills,"I've suffered with IBS on and off for over 10 years and nothing helped this condition,either prescription or OTC, until I began using Digestive Advantage, I believe this is an excellent product!!"
1,sorry i bot it at least i get a refund...,this did not work for every1 i suggest having low expectations because if they are high then you will b disappointed. i say give it a go anyway cuz who knows it has helped alot of peeps but as for me NOTHING i think i am allergic 2 the surclose that they INSIST on putting in this product O well tho. peace and GOOD LUCK! :}
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I have tried lots of things for my IBS and these did not work for me at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I did get zelnorm from my doctor and I LOVE it. The first day you get diarrhea but after that they work great!
3,IBS Capsules,I didn't see any difference. You can save your money because you can probably find a better capsule at Whole Foods.
3,"Didn't help with bloating, however company issued refund.","I purchased this product based upon all the favorable reviews. I took it twice daily for 10 days, and did not have any improvement in bloating symptoms. I returned the unused portion to the company and was issued a full refund for the purchase price, minus $5.65 for shipping."
4,Tones down the urge to go so much.,"I'm giving this four stars instead of five, because it has not helped me completely. It does help the frequency and the terrible cramping that I had. I do like that it does NOT interfere with my prescription meds that I have to take everyday, so that's a plus."
4,Advantage IBS,I've been taking this since the last of June and have had very few problems with IBS. Seems like a winner to me!
5,Great Stuff,"I have been taking this product for a little over a year and have been 95% symptom free. After a trip to the emergency room, numerous trips to my doctor, and several perscriptions, I did a internet search and found Digestive Advantage for IBS. I would not normally endorse any type of supplement, but this stuff really works for me.It even allows me to go back to drinking coffee, (in moderation), something I had to give up before.I would urge anyone who's been diagnosed with IBS, to please give this a try."
2,Didn't help my wife.,I got these for my wife because she has bowel problems. All I can say is that they didn't help her. Maybe they work for some people and not for others.
5,Digestive Advantage - good product,"I am very price oriented, and I checked out Amazon.com, to compare the price with what I was paying at the drug stores and food markets.Amazon.com was cheaper. Next I checked the shipping fees because I wouldn't be saving too much if I had to pay them but again Amazon had no shipping fees on this product.Amazon.com gets a 10 for service and cheaper prices."
1,"Did NOT work for me!!! If it seems too good to be true, it probably is!!","Bought this product because I read all the reviews, and I was hopeful that it would improve things for me. I have had severe IBS-D for 5 years now following a cholecystectomy, and I have not seen ANY improvement after having taken this for almost 2 months. I also took 2 capsules a day since it said some people might do better with 2 instead of 1. I will finish the box, but will not be trying this again. I did not expect it to do miracles, but after 50 days, I expect to see some changes. Nothing. I still get strong cramps 3-5 times daily and have to run to the bathroom. I have tried the herbal remedies, the pro-biotic remedies, fiber, and the doctor approved medicines (amitriptyline, hyoscyamine, dicyclomine, and many more) and nothing has worked for me. Hopefully it'll work for you, but no go here!! (Be happy you have a gallbladder too)"
2,Digestive Advantage,I have been using Digestive Advantage for several years with excellent results and highly recommend it.
5,Muy buen producto,"Es un producto recomendable, ayuda a la flatulencia, a evacuaciones normales y sin dolor, de una a dos diarias, en mi caso tomé una dos diarias hasta que se acabó una caja y luego seguí con una diaria."
2,Wrong type sent,"Ordered Digestive Advantage IBS and received Digestive Advantage Intensive Bowel Support.Digestive Advantage IBS - Irritable Bowel System, Capsules, 96-Count"
3,ibs help,this product may help somewhat; I keep taking it wondering whether it helps. I am loath to quit because it may be helping a bit.
3,ok but not fantastic,"I tried this because of all the great ratings on amazon. However, I took it once a day for 3 weeks and didn't notice much difference. Then I took it twice a day for 3 weeks and still didn't notice much of a difference. Align worked better for me."
4,Worked for me.,I was an IBS prospect and nothing could make me well again. Even the prescription remedies couldn't help. My doctor finally said to try a probiotic and see if that would help. I use other Schiff products and have found them to be top of the line. I ordered the Digestive Advantage and I have not had any diarrhea problems since I began to use it.
3,NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY,"I received my red bag with some black markings on the outside and after two months of use, the fabric has torn around the grommets. Not a very good quality bag."
3,It's a Good one,"I bought this bag in the olive color, not offered now. I was very happy with the bag. It is very very roomy, carries my stuff beautifully. I'm used to name bags and I definitely see the difference here with the details. But for this price, it was very nice."
1,"Poor service, I would not recommend this seller",I made an order almost four weeks ago. I never received the items or an email pertaining to the status of my order. I called them five times and left messages which included my order number and a phone number that I can be reached. I never received a return call. I also sent them two emails and never received a response. I finally called Amazon and was advised that they cancelled my order. Amazon was unable to determine why. They are not a company that I would consider doing business with.
3,Should have more magnetic closure clips on top. Too loose.,"This is a pretty purse, and big, but if it falls over, things will fall out because there is only one magnetic snap on top. It needs more closure.The inside is very roomy, and well made. I just found it too bulky for me, and needs at least 2 or 3 more magnets to close it, so things don't fall out."
1,So disappointing,"The bag came in a very nice linen protecting bag, and was very well packaged. It arrived quickly too, so I was so excited opening the box! But the bag... It is a little smaller than it shows in the photographs, you can not get your arm through the handles if you are wearing a serious coat. The stitching is awful, and it is lined with a very shiny powder blue artificial satin. The stitching and the lining are really impossible to overcome, at least for me."
1,"Misleading, Bad Quality","I was looking for a large purse to use when I go out for interviews and go on professional outings. The photos displayed for this bag make it look larger than it actually is and the quality of the bag is terrible. After shopping around more I found a bigger, better quality and more professional looking bag for $20. DO NOT buy this item..."
4,great red bag,I bought this bag for my daughter at college. She loves it - says it makes her feel sophisticated!
2,Never Enough,"Through his main character, Devlin, Hefferman shows that mixing the ambitions of the rich with the mind set of the mob can cause mayhem and even murder. It becomes more dangerous when these worlds overlap into the political arena; no one is beyond corruption.Even the powerful and rich never seem to have ""enough"" and will do anything to attain ""more"". Their inflated egos give the strength and incentive to do anything even murder so that their hungry egos are feed. An entertaining read."
5,Excellent Tripod,"Not only is this tripod very sturdy, but it is perfect for shooting video. I bought this model because it has what is called a fluid head. There is no fluid in the head, of course, but it pans as if it were turning through a fluid - very smooth. You can move the camera up, down, left, or right and not get any quick stops or starts. It really is very smooth. It is not a light tripod, but it will hold a heavy camera securely. It does not have a crank to elevate the center support, but that is not necessary. The three handles allow you to set the camera in just the right position - left-right, up-down, and swiveling. It's the best tripod I've ever had."
4,Informative and timely DVD presentation,"The information on this DVD is well presented by the author. I found it to be very thought provoking and entirely relevent to the world-wide threats to freedom loving nations. I would have rated it five stars if more graphic and/or pictorial information had been included for illustration purposes. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to become more aware of the very real threats to our western civilization, which are seldom,if ever, presented in the news media."
1,They're all EVIL -- THEY JUST HATE OUR FREEDOM,"If the title of my review speaks to you, you'll love this simpistic DVD, which explains the world in terms of good and evil, ""them"" and ""us."" Kind of scary to watch, actually -- because I fear that many people feel this way, including the pugnaciously anti-intellectual currently camped out in the White House.The problem with worldviews such as this one is that they incite more of the very violence and tragically misguided outcomes they purport to oppose. Woe unto all of us if we don't wake up, and soon, to the truth behind the lies.If you're looking for information that enlightens, empowers, and makes you think, I urge you to consider the following books: ""The Great Turning,"" by David Korten; ""The Powers That Be,"" by Walter Wink; ""The Great Work,"" by Thomas Berry; ""The Chalice and the Blade,"" by Riane Eisler, ""Nonviolent Communications,"" by Marshall Rosenberg, and ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"" by John Perkins."
3,hinge placement,When installing these Hinges . the company that drilled the 1 3/8 hole drilled them 3/16 from edge of door. this causes the door to stick out from the cabinet frame approx the same or more. the hinge has no adjustment for this.
4,Do the job.,I am replacing our kitchen cabinet doors. These hinges are working well. They can be adjusted in and out. You have to put the screw in the center to move up and down but still works well.
4,And once again he succeeds!,"I purchased Deadly Game by X-Raided, not knowing what to expect. X-Raided is my favorite rapper, and I have all but two of his CDs. I was astounded when I read the back cover of the CD, where it says that this CD was made FROM THE HOLE(solitary confinement). Now that is just crazy. No matter what they do to him, X-Raided continues to put out great albums, and if you're considering buy this one, make sure you do. The quality is pretty bad...like the bonus track that turns out to be an exact duplicate of another song on there. Most of the songs are remixes of his old ones, theres some new ones too, including Deadly Game, which garuntees to be an underground hit. There are also clips of news casts and interviews. SUPPORT X-RAIDED! BUY THIS CD!"
4,Ignore the cheesy title!,"This Black Lace novel has an actual plot, with characters you care about. The main female character is pretty selfish, but even she grows on you. She and her boyfriend steal money from someone you DON'T want to mess with. The storyline follows their adventures as they try to escape the long reach of his influence. Plenty of spicy action along the way. If you enjoyed ""Searching for Venus"", ""A Secret Place"" or ""Dramatic Affairs"", you'll like this book."
1,Horrible quality of c.d.'s DO NOT BUY,"So I wrote a few data disks and was pretty happy with them. I went to but them into a c.d. casing that I wanted to hold in place with some simply scotch tape. The c.d. accidentally snagged on the tape and the entire film coating came off as easy as if the wind just blew it.I later touched it with my fingers and even more of it came off on the padding of my thumb. THAT is how horrible the film was attached to the back of the c.d.For those who don't know, all of the data you write onto the disk is written on that film (on the other side of which is situated in a sudo-impressive font the company's logo). It in itself is so flimsy and thin that I feel like if you were to write with a powerful enough sharpie, it would eat it right through.On the bright side, the completely worthless piece of see-through plastic I am now left with is of the highest possible quality as it would not waiver under the mighty scotch tape's tyrannical hand.Here's proof![...][...]"
1,phillips cdr 100 pk,"mad at myself for buying the cheapest cd's. my computer won't use them, my cd recorder won't use them, very bummed out.don't know if i got a bad batch, but lost the reciept and now i'm stuck with a 100 pk of garbage. thumbs down =0("
3,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"The price is right, but the discs scratch very easily. They do work, but don't buy if you plan on using the disc for a long time to come..."
1,Avoid This Seller,"The CD spindle was put in a cinder block sized box with minimal airbag protection. Result: spindle broke, leaving a box of free CDs scratching against each other among 3-4 deflated plastic bags. No waya to talk to person. On line, replacement not allowed. I returned the box and am awaiting refund now, but presumably will lose free shipping on the rest of my order (which I ordered only to bring the total up to $25."
1,Damaged product,"Order 4 spindles. When they arrived two where busted and CDs where strewn all over the box, scratched beyond uses. Lost a full spindle of CDs. Pissed."
5,works fine,"Sent my mom some cd's, took the advice of another reviewer and did not write on discs, just in the center, then labeled sleeves. Haven't had one issue, and my moms technological level would have encountered any issues if there ever was one. No knock on her, just an example of our elderly and their refusal to grasp anything new. These cd's are great and without any flaws or issues. I would buy again and again if I needed to."
4,Does the job.,"As with any dvd bundles, there are always around 15 defective discs. My opinion is that one should never pay more than $20 or $21 for a bundle of 100s."
4,CD Blanks,"Good product for the money. Worked on my Mac and PC. Wish the they provided sleeves. A good by anyway, Product shipped in a timely manner"
1,"Beware, the recordable layer flakes off!","Half-way through a spindle, I discovered that blanks that I had already recorded were becoming worthless. The recordable layer, which is stamped on top, was bubbling up and just flaking off. You can see right through the plastic disk! This hasn't happened to me in many thousands of CDRs bearing other brands, and is a genuine disaster if the disk contains your only copy of key data. Twice I called Philips tech support and they showed no real interest. They ignored my suggestion to take the batch code imprinted on the disk plastic. Bad disks, bad company."
5,Alot of Disc's for a little mula,"Well, the packaging looks good....its been about 2 months since I bought the disc's, and still haven't used any.So its unfair to post a negative review, without giving the product a good run thru....so I have to trust theadvertised information, and say its a good product."
2,you get what you pay for,"I haven't had a problem with the actual disks, but they tend to arrive with the spindles and packaging broken, and often I'll find loose disks in the box. Did I say broken? try crushed, in pieces, and sometimes even missing the entire bottom of the spindle. But heck, you want a cheap price, go for it."
1,TERRIBLE,I have thrown away at least 1/2 of these CD's after they failed mid-burn!!! They are absolutely terrible. Most of them do not burn at all. Do not waste your money or your time with these.
5,camera review,I enjoy taking pictures with this digital camera. I also recorded videos that I downloaded on the computer. It would make a great gift for a family member.
5,GOOD PICTURES,"My afterschool teacher has one of these and she has affirmed me that it takes good pictures. I saw tem too. THe zoom really works. For this price, it is ver good."
2,You get what you pay for,I have had this camera for about two years. To turn on the camera there is a rotating knob on top. After about a year this began to stick and is very hard to turn now. I have played with the settings but taking pictures that require flash pretty much turns everyone in the photo ten shades paler than they actually are.This is the kind of camera you give to a teenager as their first camera. Definetely not something to invest in if this is a camera for the family.Not sure why it got such amazing reviews for its subpar quality.
1,WANNA PAINT YOUR TOILET BOWL?,"I've tried a few different similar products and with this one in particular the only difference I noticed was having the runs on days I used this...and when I say ""runs"" I really mean gas-powered, high velocity, uncontrollable, SQUIRTS"
5,"Surprisingly good, if you split in half","Ive gained 20 lbs of muscle using this product in roughly a year which is great because I'm a hard gainer and 20 lbs is alot! I just split the dose (2 packed scoops) and mixed half water half milk as the 16 oz of liquid the box calls for (8oz each). The result is a leaner drink than you can actually drink with ease after working out and not feel ""weighed down"" while still consuming roughly 600 calories, 30 or so grams of protein and the vitamins that are in this to aid muscle building."
2,"Don't buy this stuff, buy Protein instead!","I bought this product hoping that i would gain more weight and mass and get bigger and stronger, but it didn't quite work like i'd hoped, and actually it tasted quite aweful, it is too sweet and it doesn't blend very well, it tastes like chocolate goo...pretty gross and hard to swallow....I bought this product, along with Jacked to build endurance, and i would highly recommend Jacked, it gives you a lot of energy and endurance, but this product only makes you feel nauseous, like you just ate four big macks lol..."
4,The brighter side,"The strings stretch and detune a bit but it gets better with time. It takes longer for silicon strings to settle in than regular bass strings. The strings are a bit fragile. I'm told it helps to remove the string tension between sessions, particularly on the D and G.On the other hand: it weighs so little, it's so small and it has so little tension in the strings that it causes musch less trouble with my carpal tunnel wrist and extends my rehearsal time. And it sounds nice. My tenor sax trio prefers the upright, but ranks the Ashbory tone above either my fretless or fretted Fender jazz.When I first received my Ashbory I was ready to send it back. Now I like it."
2,Great Look; Disappointing Performance,"I have been wanting this little bass for a long time, and finally decided to purchase it, even though I had never had an opportunity to test one. Worse decision ever. For me, the bass is virtually unplayable. It's not so much that the strings are too close together for my playing style, but it's the fact that the strings do not stay in tune. Because this is a fretless bass, adjustments can be made relatively quickly, but when you play ""positions"" like I do, and the position does not remain in tune over very short time spans, the frustration level rises exponentially. Not recommended for any serious bassists."
2,Vizsla Calendar,"It's OK but the dogs do tend to be more the American 'type' rather than showing dogs from the UK, Australia, Europe etc. Only to be expected when the calendar is produced in the US."
5,Excellent purchase,"I wanted to echo the glowing reviews of the bouncer. Our daughter has actually slept most nights in the bouncer with a blanket folded into the leg holes to seal them up (probably not recommended by the company but worked great for us). If she would fuss a little at night, the gentle bouncing seemed to soothe her back to sleep.Now that she is almost 2 months, she happily sits up in the bouncer and watches us eat dinner and do chores.I had a hard time spending this much money on baby equipment but we've really received our money's worth."
5,love it,"This sitter really does grow with your child, it is very durable, and user friendly. It's worth the $."
4,Sturdy Product,Very well made seat....it is designed so that even the littlest baby can sit in it. My 8 week old is just learning to hit the colorful bears. It also fits perfectly within my home as it just looks better than many of the others. My only complaint is the expense.
3,A Little Larger than What I Wanted,"So far the BabyBjorn Baby Sitter has been great. My little one will sit in it and bounce away contentedly as long as he is feed and changed. The only complaints I have is that is not as easy to change from one position to another as I would like and it is advertised as being small enough to fold up and travel with. While it folds down nicely for travel, I was looking for something a little smaller and more compact for greater ease of being able to carry the baby and the sitter in somewhere on my own."
4,newmom0608,"We ordered this after trying out a friend's. Our little boy loves it, and I love how easy it is to store. We have so many baby things all over the house, it's nice to have one that folds up and can go anywhere so easily. I also like that it's not at all complicated - there aren't a ton of toys hanging over his face, and it's simple to use. Quality is great too. Would def. recommend!!"
4,Just as described,"Got this a few weeks ago for my then 4 week old. Had previously bought and returned an Eddie Bauer seat - which was terrible. All others seem to just lay back to far. My little one wants to sit up when not sleeping. The different positions in this are great and I know she'll be able to use this seat for awhile. Worth the extra $ in my opinion. Like the basic idea. Music, etc seems too stimulating for little ones. She just sits and takes in her surroundings."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"I tried this bouncer at a friends house and knew my baby was happy in it so I bought one. I didn't realize how happy he'd be though! And as a bonus, there's a cool twirly toy attachment that comes with it. I was thrilled when my 3 month old intuitively reached out to touch the toy...hand eye coordination...check! You won't be disappointed with this bouncer, especially at a time when other baby seats are being recalled. You will feel confident that your child is safe and happy."
3,good condition,"Our baby had to adjust to it... at first he didn't really like it. Now he can sleep in it, but we do have to rock him in it before he sleeps if he is not sleeping yet. His body does not naturally rock it back and forth (up and down). We are hoping that as he gets older (he is now just about 2 months) that he'll grow more used to it and rock it more. It is not a total waste though, he does sleep in it alot, mostly in the daytime. However, it's kind of bad because he gets so used to it he has a harder time sleeping in his bassinet. Hopefully the money that we paid will equal out if we keep using it. However, the bad thing is the playthings (those little teddy bears). We took them off and haven't put them on since, and now I can't figure out how to put it back on and have it stay. He did not like those teddy bears though."
5,"Practical, Useful, Stylish, Compact - No Batteries Needed!",I wish I would have bought this sooner and saved myself some money! My 4 month old baby loves to play with the little bears on this for at least 10 minutes (a long time in newborn land) which gives me a chance to take a shower - hurrah! Much prettier and more stylish than any of the other bouncers and swings out there which I tried. None were successful in entertaining my baby. This collapses flat and is made from very comfy stretch cotton. Best part is the baby does all the rocking - No batteries needed!I see that BabyBjorn has come out with a nearly identical product for twice the price - hmmm...don't fall for it! Get this one!!
2,A Romance Junkie,"Cesar was a big blockhead and I only warmed up to him in the last chapter. Bianca was not so bad, her dad was a very rich man who wanted nothing to do with her or her mother. Her mother had turned into a whore and a drunk because of her husbands rejection. Cesar was a playboy who didn't want to get married...ever. So Bianca was enjoying some good sex and kept Cesar completely out of her life. The man didn't even know where she lived. When she dumped him he had to hired a private detective to find her. It would have been a great story but there was just no romance. It was a bore. Even the ending sucked, I gave this book two stars because I actually finished it. It took me three nights to read because I kept falling asleep. I can't recommend this book at all."
5,Faith-based,"This is a book chock full of ""true-to-life"" basic information, ""real"" take-away's and ""easy"" to do lists all backed up by ""directly-related"" scripture readings. The Happy Husband's Handbook discusses how two individuals can blend two lives into one--the art of having a happy marriage. It is a short, to the point and easy to read book that talks about the two important C's--commitment and communication. It is a book that couples will want to refer to on a regular basis. And once you read this book, your relationships will never be the same! Sly Fleming has created ""unique companion"" book for couples in a devoted and committed relationship."
1,Feel cheated,"I have no problem with the product, except that I don't know how to use it, because amazon ommitted including the user's instructions, which means I don't know how to use it. I have repeatedly tried to get in touch with amazon, but they simply have failed to even acknowledge my complaint. Not very customer-friendly, I'd say."
1,a poor introduction,"If I can save anyone the pain of using this book I would like to do it. This was used for my undergraduate course in mathematical statistics (the first statistics course for me). Fortunately, I had an excellent professor, and was able to learn the material from him and from other texts. Rice is extraordinarily difficult to understand. There are many examples of poor English with ambiguous sentences, algebraic errors, failure to emphasize or sometimes even to explain or define essential concepts, and obtuse end-of-chapter problems. In order to learn the material, I made use of several other textbooks, including Hogg & Craig and Bain & Englehart. Both of these books, in fact EVERY one of the ten or so books I used, was far better than Rice."
2,If you have a choice choose a different book,"I bought and used this book for a probability class and for preparation for the Society of Actuaries (SOA) exam course 1. I had never had a probability or statistics class and this book did a very poor job of helping me to understand the topics. I had to resort to using other books not required for the class in order to understand anything. I did not pass the the SOA exam and I blame that, in part, on this stupid book. I also had about 50 class mates, all of which had just as much disgust for the book as I did. Not disgust for the class but for the book."
1,My experience with the gates of hell,"To be quite frank, I dispised this book with a passion. This book embodies all that is evil under one cover. And that cover is not even pretty to look at. Suffice to say, I do not like this book at all. I would rather be dragged over a bed of scalding hot mono-molecular tipped nails. Do not buy this book. Do not even consider buying this book. This book is just plain terrible. Do not even take this course, for you shall surely fail. The only pictures you will see are those descibed by double integrals. I do not like double integrals. Especially when they are related to the worst subject known to mankind, in the worst book ever know to mankind. I shall be burning this book very shorty. Please do not buy this book, unless you want to burn it with me. Yes, you can say I really really disliked this book. Yeah."
4,Good introductory text on data analysis,Rice's book is a classic and good introductory text on data analysis. You should look elsewhere for a more rigorous treatment of mathematical statistics. Most of the proofs are left out and the focus seems to be on practice. There are lots of examples using real data but I thought at times that the examples tended to overwhelm the reader.
1,poorly written and difficult to understand,"The chapters are poorly written and difficult to read. The book does a good job of taking simple concepts and making them practically incomprehensible. Many of the examples refer to and build on previous examples, so if you get lost on one example it becomes even more difficult to understand anything that comes after it. And on top of all this, the problems at the end of the chapter often seem to have little to do with the material that is ""covered"" in that chapter. Overall, a bad book that made my prob/stats class much more painful than it should have been."
1,Using this for an intro stats/prob course right now,"The class has just started, and I'm very worried about how I'm going to do this quarter. It took a lot of extra effort in order to understand the examples, and many of the ways he writes the problems and examples aren't explained anywhere. Without having taken some logic math classes before, I wouldn't have been able to understand even the first chapter."
5,Very good statistical book,"Very good for the beginner. Very explicit, lots of examples, with odd problems answered. Sometimes it doesn't demonstrate some theorems, but it gives a rather well explanation of its applications."
1,Return of Black Death - The best book to ensure confusion,"I have been using this book as the ""foundation"" of my statistics studies for two semesters - as a result, I have encountered great difficult in comprehending the subject. This is one of the most student-unfriendly books I have ever encountered. Its ""examples"" are unclear, vaigue, and confusing. It is because of books like this that Statistics Study Guides are published.Amazon.com does not offer a ""0 Star"" value for its rating system. Infact, and infinitely long ""negative star"" rating would be more representitive of this book's rating.Stat Professors, hear our prayers: please do not use this book.Stat Students using this book: You might want to consider purchasing a Study-guide type of book, because I assure you that most of you will *not* find this book enjoyable, helpful, or useful."
2,Complex and Vague,"The book covers very complex concepts (includes some very difficult applications), whereas lacked the explanations of some very basic concepts (how to use statistical tables etc.) The book is definitely not for beginners (prob. theory and statistics). The disk that was included did not work; probaby requires some special software. Good aspect of the book was that it included lots of exercises. Recommended for someone that has already studies statistic for at least a semester. Beginners; forget it!"
2,Inadequate introduction to mathematical statistics,"As a graduate student in statistics, I learned to hate this textbook. The text is filled with plenty of formulas, but lacks plain English explanations and illustrations. Many of the subjects, such as the treatment of functions of jointly distributed random variables (Z = X + Y, Z = X/Y, etc.) in Chapter 3, are completely inadequate. I needed more diagrams so that I could wrap my mind around these concepts and understand them at an intuitive, geometric level. I also failed to understand the importance of Sufficiency and the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound in Chapter 8. These subjects seemed to lack any real-world applications and are just math games as far as I'm concerned.Avoid this book like the plague if you're a beginner in statistics. It'll turn you off to the subject!"
1,Bought out of compulsion,"I had to buy this book just because my teacher used it as required text. The book is pretty mediocre, clearly not worth $135. You can get much better understanding of statistics using books by Schaums series. The book does have decent examples, but is very overpriced- I do not believe it should cost more than $20."
1,"Overall, very poor intro for stat beginngers","Although I do not believe that this book is the TRUE embodyment of evil like the other reviewer, I believe that this book is not at all a good introduction to Satistics for a beginner. The examples are poor and the text is at times incomprehensible. I hope that someone, someday creates a stat book that will combat the boring stat professors and write a decent book for students to read.Btw: If this book didn't cost so much it would be the first book of my college career that I would have burned and enjoyed"
2,Leaves much to be desired,"While the text may suffice for a grad student of stats or data analysis, it lacks key concept explination, logical proofs, and especilly well worked examples. Undergrads whose course requires this text should be advised not to miss a single lecture session, as learning straight from the book is a hopeless endevour to say the least. It also would help if a solutions manual were made available, as the problems are quite difficult. The majority of my present stats class at UWO agrees that this book should be avoided at all costs."
1,Simply one of the worst textbooks in statistics,"This book is the worst math / statistics textbook that I have ever encountered. The explanation for most concepts is either inadequate or incomprehensible. The worst fact is that Rice has a tendency to introduce new variables in examples and proofs without ever defining the variables. Rice's notation also differs from standard statistical notation for many topics. Overall, there are really very little redeeming features about this book except nice tables and several good problems. I strongly do not recommend purchasing this book, as it makes a worthless reference."
1,Was this book written in English?,"I have a finance degree, a math degree, and an M.B.A. The only reason that I mention this is because in obtaining these degrees, I have had to read alot of books.Up to this point, there hasn't been a book, if I took enough time reading it, that I couldn't understand. I have given up with this book!"
2,Not Recommended,"The book is badly written. Very Very bad design. Although it is full of content and not you could find loads of information abouttheorytical and practical statistics, the language is often confusing and important data are given in the middle of redundant paragraphs. I wish the book had sections with key information and the examples where better explained.A person with limited math-stats background will be lost."
3,Modest Beginnings,"This volume of writing offers the careful reader glimpses of Anais Nin before she reinvented herself. Or does it? One can never be sure with Nin.The girl who became Anais Nin, scandalous diarist, was clearly highly articulate, and determined to live a life of Art and Passion, even when her mother was making her do housework as a teenager in their modest rental house in Queens. It provides a gentle introduction to her life and times, and a fascinating contrast to searing works such as _Incest_, taken from diary material written some twenty or so years later. One also gets some interesting views of early-twentieth century New York City.The book, taken in the context of Nin's later work, offers evidence that we become what we most want to be. Dreamer, beware!"
5,Outstanding CD!!!!,"This CD contains all of the greatest hits of Desert Rose, however, my only regrets are the song ""Running."" This would be a complete set if this song was included.I notice that you can purchase the compact disc ""Running"", but the compact disc is out of print and that makes the price a little steep. Oh well, you get what you pay for and this band in my opinion is worth it."
5,Country Rock At It's Best,"For the life of me, I can't understand why this group isn't being played by country radio. They are a spring of refreshing water in the current morass of Nashville pop. If you have loved Poco or the early Eagles, you'll become a fan of the Desert Rose Band. Buy this and every other Chris Hillman CD. You won't be sorry."
5,You gotta own this one,"If you like progressive country you gotta get this. Every song here is a hit so it's difficult to select a favorite. ""One Step Forward (Two Steps Back)"", ""Hello Trouble"", and ""He's Back and I'm Blue"" were top hits in the 80's. The virtuoso guitar playing in ""Price I Pay"" with Emmylou Harris is guaranteed to energize. If you already own any Desert Rose, you'll want to add this to your collection. If you are new to the band's music this is the best place to start."
5,Hare Krishna book of Vegetarian Cooking,"The book arrived quickly, the recipes are excellent, many Indian Dahl (lentil) recipes are tasty and nutritious. Finding recipes that are complementary to complete the protein for a vegetarian is helpful."
3,The way it was,"Soko Moringa Roshi's autobiography offers a vivid glimpse of the rigors of traditional Japanese monastic training in a previous generation. It also offers a rather romanticized view of how practice works: after years of struggle and privation, the young monk achieves a great satori and lives happily ever after. Valuable as a historical document (and an often entertaining yarn) it won't offer much help to anyone trying to figure out how to practice today in their daily life."
2,Great in theory but modules constantly burn out,"Love this system. Love what it does. You can easily turn off any and all lights in your home, as well as appliances. You can impress your friends with various dimming and scene set ups all from the touch of a button on a remote. However, the sylvania brand modules only last a few months in my experience. I've had to return at least 20 of these things. I buy a few, they bust after a few months, I return them for new ones, and the same thing happens after a few months. Finally I just got sick of it. I'm going to try the instamatic brand..."
2,Disappointed,"First of all, I would like to say that I am quite disappointed to what they did with the anime.The anime does not do justice for the manga (which is excellent, btw)a. much of the story is skipped over and discardedb. even if the manga was not read, the ending will seem rushedHowever, if you decide to just watch the anime, it is a pretty good one; but, if you want something better, read the manga. It is only 80 something chapters. I'm sure you can find some scanlation site in the internet and read it there.Anime after/without reading manga: 2/3.5 starsManga: 4.5 stars"
1,"sv-ap10, frustrating","i bought one of these photo printers when i was overseas in dubai, probably one of the only places to get it i guess. while the printer makes wonderful photographs, i could not get the television option to work, so i have to use my laptop, no big deal. the real problem is finding replacement cartridges. not sure if i ever will! would recommend a kodak or something easier to find here in the states."
4,Cute!,This was a really sweet book that I purchased to help my child when dropping him off at school. Very cute message and my son liked it.
5,"Cute and Helpful (Wish there was a ""Daddy"" Version!)","I got this book to prepare my toddler for going to preschool/mother's morning out. He loves it. The pictures are cute and the words are simple. The only thing I wish was that there was a ""dad"" version of this book, since it's not just Mommy's that miss their children and love them ""all day long."""
5,A Wonderful Book to Own,I accidentally picked this book out for my son (I liked the picture on the front). My son is almost one but my husband and I have read this book to him numerous times. He really enjoys the story and he smiles when he sees Little Owen.I love the story and illustration. It reminds me of the stories I've read when I was growing up. A must have for anyone's nursury collection!
3,Good for kids starting preschool,This book is very appropriate for young children starting preschool. I wish I had read this to my daughter before she started school. I actually searched for this kind of book because she was having a bit of trouble adapting to the change. She likes this book except that the characters are pigs. I think she would have like real people instead. We purchased another book on going to nursery school with real people and she seems to prefer that one more.
5,Helped My Son So Much,"I was looking for a book to read to my 3-year-old son to help him adjust to attending all day nursery school twice a week. Based on other customer reviews, I chose this one. This is just a sweet book where mommy is reminding her little one Owen that even though they are apart, while he is doing all his school activities - whether it be making a new friend or making a mistake - she is thinking about him and loving him throughout the day. The book ends with mommy picking up her child from school, and reading together at night. Now at our bedtime reading, my son says ""I want to read about Owen"". Also, I've used the book for other issues such as sleeping alone (""See? Owen sleeps in his bed all by himself."") - it has really helped! I highly recommend this book!"
5,What a great discovery!,"I discovered this book by accident and it has literally become a staple of evening reading with my 2 1/2 year old. It's so great to watch a child grasp the concept that just because a parent is away from them during the day, doesn't mean they don't still love them. My daughter says ""I Love and miss you all day long, Mommy"" almost every day when I leave for work. I have given this book to all of my working mom friends, too! A must have!"
4,Wonderful book for my two year old....,My daughter suffers from separation anxiety and I purchased this book as a last resort and I am so glad I did. My daughter has related very well to the storyline and she loves the illustrations. Its a great match for her and myself and I definately recommend it.
1,not what it says,I ordered the doll because it said it will swim when put in water. When I recieved the doll it was just a barbie. It is not the swimming mermaid.
1,NOT THE SWIMMING MERMAID,"I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon! After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water. IT IS NOT!!!! Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress. Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed. Beware of this seller! I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description. Believe me - it was there before."
1,Daughter will be sad come Christmas,Like others I was mislead by the false description given. I waited to open the box til the 21st so that my daughter would not see it. I didn't realize til I took it out the packaging that it had legs and not a tail! Now I have had to go to ebay and it's doubtful that it will be here by Christmas. Very disappointed in Amazon.
1,"Sorry, don't be a sucker","I just wanted to say, I hope that no one finds there self given there daughter a gift that was suppose to be the best gift ever..I had to work so I had a friend track down what was suppose to be the swimming mermaid..to both our surprise Amazon had it..(right)...Have you ever seen the sadness in a lil ones eyes when they think they have something and it turns out to be all wrong, well if you have not, then I hope that you never do...This was my first time dealing with Amazon and at this time it may be my last...As of today, this same doll is still showing as if it is the swimming mermaid when in fact it is just a regular doll..buyer beware..."
5,haunting,"this book shook me up for so long, then i read ""deep end of the ocean"" and was so disappointed in that being the oprah pick, and a disturbing and moving book like ""stolen child"" got overlooked. ""deep end"" i couldn't wait to get through it, it was awful. ""stolen child"" was so tense and disturbing, a great read. one i think about years later."
4,Franco's heavy bag training,"I ordered this video as an aid to my training regiment. It was informative as well as motivating. As with any training aid, it is only as good as the person using it. If you expect to be a better puncher just because you watched a video, you will be disappointed. If you follow the instruction and incorporate it in our workout, you will see results!"
3,Not color as pictured,"This is a beautifully carved, heavy pendant. The only problem I have with it is that the color is very pale. It is not the lush coral color shown in the photo.I did contact the manufacturer but received no reply. I did tell them I like the pendant and will not be returning it but just that I am disappointed with its color."
5,These Two Books are Different!,"I wanted to clarify what the reviewer above says about this book and ""Smart Power"". This book (The Renewable Energy Handbook) is geared more towards off-grid applications whereas Smart Power is for on-grid folks. Not surprisingly, there is some overlap between the two books but their focus is different, especially since The Renewable Energy Handbook has been revised and updated and is almost twice the size."
1,be careful here,"Not all h700s are the same. Some say they have a range for 33 feet, others 30 feet. I'm not sure why, but I own two. One I purchased at a retail Cingular store for about $80. It says it's good for 33 feet; the sound quality, both receiving and listening, is very good and I would give it, overall, four stars. But I saw an h700 here for $40 -- same model pictured above -- and bought it as a backup. It's very disappointing and I plan to return it. The sound quality is poor and the battery dies in an hour. I suspect it's defective. It matters to me not whether it has a range of 30 to 33 feet -- on both models, once you are about 15 feet from the cell phone, there's static. But I suspect that while the models are the same, the one that's good for 33 feet may be newer and improved. So keep that in mind in checking these out."
3,Good product,Good bluetooth however when i got it you could tell it wasnt new it was refurnish!!!!But it works fine
2,Poor Quality,The quality was poor. I was able to use it for three weeks before it seperated and came apart. It was poorly put together. I would not purchase again.
2,Poor sound,"I'm using it with a Sony Ericsson phone. The reception is so bad in a car, I only use it when I have to. And lately I've opted just use the phone sans headset, because of the quality. On more than one occasion, the person I'm calling says ""Are you in a cave?"".About 3 months after using this headset, the top volume button fell off after I dropped it on the ground.Works fine if there's very little outside noise, like in my quiet home."
4,"works great, however mic picks up a lot of background noise too.","Gave this as a gift to my son who is on the road a lot. It arrived in a timely manner. He had an easy time synchronizing it to his phone, finds it easy to use, gets good reception. Only negative comment is that the microphone picks up a lot of background noise in certain situations, which can be annoying to person receiving call. Because he has a hearing deficiency in one ear, I was concerned about how this would work for him, but my son loves it!"
1,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this product. It may be defective, but I can't hold a conversation with the earpiece. Everyone that I have a conversation with are complaining about the reception. This product works well in the house, but while I am driving it is USELESS. The purpose for the purchase was so that I would be able to talk on the phone via the earpiece while commuting to and from work. This product hasn't been beneficial and I get frustrated and turn off the device. Money wasted!!!!!"
4,This is seriously a so so product.,Okay the only problem I have with this phone is it does not get good range you have to keep it on the same side as the phone and where your device is. It has absoulutely no range.
3,defective,"I ordered my H700 right here on Amazon, from Amazon themselves. I just received it two days ago (1-11-2007) and I'm planning on contacting Motorola for a replacement today. The specific problem that it had right out of the box is that the button to sense whether the mic boom is open or closed is REAL sensitive. I can't even slightly touch my earpiece without it turning off and on repeatedly. Sometimes it even turns off and on just with it sitting on my ear and I'm not touching it. I owned an HS850 that I never had this problem with. I'm hoping that my particular H700 is just a lemon and I'm going to contact Motorola today to get a replacement. If it wasn't for this problem I think it would be the best earpiece to own, and if the replacement works properly I'll be real happy. More later."
5,Works Great!,"I bought this for my Motorola KRZR K1m. Works great from the start. Everyone one I have talked to has said I sound more clearer (aside from some background noise) than I did before I bought this headset. This headset uses a mini-USB charger, one is included, but I don't use it since my phone uses the same charger.I use this headset mainly in the car, but I have been told if I have the radio on they can hear bits and pieces of the audio, and they can hear the car engine at times when I accelerate. Other than that, background noises aren't as bad a on a normal cell phone, but with my cell phone, this headset picks up more background noises.The range on this headset is pretty good, I sat the phone on the other side of the house, and walked to the furthest corner (which is well over 30-33 feet), and I could still hear everything (keeping in mind this was a 100% charge), and they could hear me. As I got further away, it started to break up slightly."
2,bluetooth,"it was what i ordered however i thought i was ordering the other model, everyone says the sound on it is muffled, the place i ordered it from was great no complaints about them."
1,Seems like a fake ...,I have an other motorola bluetooth headset whic work so much better than this one. The sound qulaity is poor .. the packaging looks authentic ...but the unit does not seem real Motorola to me.
2,love and hate it,"When I first got this I was amazed at how well it fit, had a little bit of crackling. Now I know the ear piece has a lot of crackling. People can hear me well and I forget I even have it on my ear, but I can't even walk 5 feet from the phone and people say that I am fading and their voice is crackling. I wanted so bad for this to be the right bluetooth. I have a Samsung A900 phone and I have tryed the Samsung WEP200 that I like but everyone says I sound to far away, I also have tryed Sony Ericson that I almot through out the car window it is so bad. So now it is back to the best bluetooth for my phone and my ear. I wear glasses so it is hard."
4,Know What You're Doing,"If you have to write in C, then yes, it is still worth reading a good, short book about C even if it was written in 1989. It can get a bit boring to read the details of selected problems and solutions in C cover-to-cover, but it's only 100 pages. An experienced C programmer will probably know many of these answers, and can skim over what's not new. But if you hit even one pitfall which is new to you, or which you have not made the effort to avoid, then the book was worth it. The bonus is the last chapter, ""Advice"". It's only a few pages, and is followed by answers to exercises. But I think it has more meaning if you do leave it until the end of your reading.(One caveat: Since Koenig was writing before long variable names were common, his examples do not serve as best practice for modern variable-naming in an IDE with auto-complete.)"
4,"Old, but useful","Most traps and tricks are well known, but it's always good programming practice to rememeber them.So reading this book (also for experienced programmers) is suggested to best keep in mind the basis of development of well-working software."
2,What A Disappointment,"I ordered this book recently. It turned out to be a complete disappointment because of the following reasons:(1) the book is thin and does not justify the high price(2) It does not cover many of the traps and pitfalls of C languageBased on the expensive price tag, I would not recommend this book. Instead, I would highly recommend the other book called ""Expert C Programming""."
4,Burst of Laughter,"It's not very often we read something that makes us burst out loud laughing, but it sure is great when we do! And I literally guffawed more than a few times while reading Joel Fried's hysterical collection of humorous ruminations. The very short reflections appropriately described as ""bursts"" are just that: little explosions from a mind that clearly sees the funny side of life, even in its most mundane moments. Fried writes about everyday situations and makes us realize just how ridiculous such familiar scenarios truly are. You can't help but laugh when reading Bursts."
4,Self-deprecating humor,"Joel Fried does not spare anybody, least of all himself, which is why you'll forgive the occasiional, well-aimed, sarcasm. It is exhilarating reading for the general public."
2,I was deeply disappointed by this book...,"I have generally had excellent luck in ordering books based on Amazon's recommendation system. This is the first to really 'miss the mark' for me.I had enjoyed both Sarah Durant's ""In the Company of a Courtesan"" and ""The Birth of Venus"", as well as ""The Illuminator"" by Brenda Vantrese. While this book was set during the same period as the three previous books, it lacked the captivating qualities they all embodied.In addition, while I realize that the Renaissance was a troubled time, full of strife and prejudice, ""The Rare and Curious Gift"" was far too mean spirited. I really couldn't identify with the 'good' characters, and the reading itself was plodding and depressing.It is my hope that other readers will pick one of the other books I've mentioned, and really enjoy the time period more fully !"
2,Beautiful but distasteful,"One of the previous reviewers, Luan Gaines, has written a wonderful description of all that this book contains and I feel that I couldn't possibly add more to that, but I just couldn't like this book. The graphic descriptions of dismemberment, the flaying of the entire skin of a previously buried corpse, and details of other gory moments are just too much for any kind of enjoyment...I read to be entertained and uplifted, not to be sickened. So, despite the undoubted authenticity of the doings of those times, I just don't care to read about them."
5,Enchanting tale,This is an enchanting tale (in more ways than one) beautifully written. Mr Burke's narrative will keep you enthralled. You feel the terror of Timmy Quinn as each hair raising discovery unfolds. As Timmy loses his childhood innocence you carry the burden of revelation with him. I cannot say more than this was a well deserved winner of the Bram Stoker Award. Anyone who enjoys horror stories a la Stephen King will be riveted by this novella.Without doubt 5 big fat *s
1,Turtle stew,someone compared this book to Stephen King? Kidding? So not impressed with this book! Character development is lacking...story line way too fanciful.
3,lost me at the end,"This book started out with great expectations of summer vacation. Very exciting and suspenseful in the middle. The end left me with the question ""What just happened"""
3,"Not Bad, But Predictable","I always have issues with books I figure out the ending to before I'm 1/3 of the way through. This was one of those books. I knew who,what, why and even the reason by the time the Turtle Boy was introduced.However, wifey did not so maybe that doesn't apply to everyone.If you're good at figuring things out, you'll see it coming. If not, it would be enjoyable book. I went middle of the road."
5,The Turtle Boy - Thrilling in a horrible way.,"Summer starts off pretty normal for Timmy and Pete. After Timmy and Pete see the ghost of Daryl at the pond they are told they cannot hang out together anymore or go back to the pond. Pete's father sends him off to summer camp and Timmy is left to fill his summer days alone. When Pete's father finds Timmy at the pond everything starts to unravel. What secrets are revealed to Timmy? And did Pete really go off to summer camp?This story reminded me a lot of Stephen King's ""The Body.""I will definitely be reading more from Kealan Patrick Burke.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.The Turtle Boy (The Timmy Quinn Series (Book One))"
4,the turtle boy,I liked the book. It was a differrent type of book than I have read.The book kept me interested in it.
4,Well Written,"Very well written, unique subject matter. Holds your attention very well. Just keep in mind it is an ongoing series, I am on the 3rd book now. The story is very different which I like. The characters are interesting and realistic. The 1st book as usual seems to be the most entertaining."
3,A bit strange,The book The Turtle Boy starts off quite normal and becomes a bit strange when he can see and communicate with the dead.
3,Better for teens,"Quick and easy to read, but geared for a younger set. Seemed almost too short. I prefer something more indepth."
4,Really liked this book!,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end, and I couldn't put it down! Crazy twists and turns. VERY GOOD READ!!!!"
3,Turtle Boy a great read for adolescents.,"I found this to be a story that young adults would find intriguing, along the lines of a good r.l. Stein story."
2,Not a good pick,"What started out as a decent story dragged into an unbelievable and predictable tale. The characters were bland, and I found myself skimming just to get to the end."
2,not what i was expecting,"Ok, this book was not what I was expecting. My mom and I read it at the same time, and both agree that it could have been writen better and the end was very disappointing."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I had to leave the story early,for me it just seemed to drag.I won't say don't read it but it didn't hold my interest"
3,Not a bad book,"Although a very different type of story, I did enjoy reading it. The subject got a little strange but still it was interesting to read."
2,"Good writing, goofy ending.","This is an interesting little story, written much better than the usual free e-book (as I am beginning to discover), but it ends abruptly after finally becoming tiresomely cryptic. I'd rather have not read it,thus avoiding that plunge off the cliff of the story. I don't care for the tease or the lead-on, and the extra ""preview"" chapters of the author's other books do not interest me for that reason. The dude can write, so why doesn't he? It's like trying to be a good chess player without knowing how to checkmate."
3,OK,This is not a book I would read again but I didn't mind it the first time around. It is saved somewhere in my cloud though.
2,Ghost story or something else?,I didn't like this story - I was focused on the abuse part of a child and had a hard time getting past that scenario. Knew there was more and I realized that BUT...Visions and dead people and bodies.. Not for me....
4,Scary Stuff,"Masterfully written (he's quite a writer) and adroitly constructed for suspense, the book is disturbing as well. I'm not accustomed to reading such grapic tales of violence and horror, made the more terrible pitting the innocence of an eleven year old boy against the dark side of death."
5,Awesome!,"I read recently a review in which the reviewer compared THE TURTLE BOY favorably to such classics as Stephen King's ""The Body"" (from DIFFERENT SEASONS--filmed as STAND BY ME) and Robert R. McCammon's BOYS LIFE. After reading this novella, I have to agree. At turns heartwarming, terrifying and funny, this creepy little story will get under your skin and stay there. It may also serve to remind you of your youth and when you first realized magic can end.Highly recommended."
1,I guess this is a series,"Typically, when an author embarks on a series, there is some kind of gratification at the end of the story that makes us feel as if our journey into the unknown has some kind of reward. That is most certainly not the case at the end of The Turtle Boy. This story ends at its climax in an apparent attempt at getting the reader to go pick up the next installment. This type of commercialism is exactly the reason why I do not watch TV.Don't get me wrong. I like trilogies. But a successful trilogy leaves the reader with a sense of triumph at the end of the first story. It leaves the reader looking forward to picking up the next story even if the only reason is to hear more about the characters.This story had none of that. It left me feeling kind of ripped off. This was an epilogue....not a stand-alone piece of reading. And the worst part is, I'm pretty certain I know what the ""mystery"" surrounding the story is all about."
4,Absolutely addictive story,"This is an absolutely addictive story of childhood and abuse. The way it unwraps will remind you of a Ray Bradbury story. The words paint memories of summertime during childhood while sucking the reader into past and present murders.I got so attached to the main character that I can't wait to read the next Timmy Quinn book. Did you like ""The 6th Sense""? If the answer is 'yes', then you will certainly want to read this story."
3,Has potential..,"I bought this book because it was free. It took me back to my childhood where I.spent many summers roaming through the woods and waters. I was somewhat disappointed with the ending. I felt that it ended abruptly leaving many unanswered questions, which makes way for a second. Quick read."
1,Not my idea of a good story,Unbelievable is a good word. So brutal and far fetched I kept waiting for it to get real. It never did and it was scary..... I don't necessarily like those kind and I didn't much care for this one. Coming back to life..? NOT
2,Hard to figure this one out,I was impressed with the ominous air from the beginning of this book. Even though it should have been a fun summer for Timmy & and his friend Pete it definately didn't turn out that way. I enjoyed the developing feeling of dread that built with each chapter but I ended up very confused by the end of the story.
3,Long time before take off,"It is a well written book but it takes a few chapters before getting into it. From my perspective, not my type of reading."
3,Decent Novella,"The Turtle Boy is a novella which held my interest throughout. The story begins with Timmy and Pete beginning to enjoy summer vacation. They meet up with a scary boy at a local pond. They are not supposed to play there, but of course that is part of the attraction. After a few twists and turns, some horror, secrets, violence and eerie magic, the ending unfolds. It does leave the reader with the feeling of an unfinished story. (Thus you would want to purchase the next of the series?) I liked the book but not well enough to buy the series."
3,It is ok,"It started out ok, but was too short and ended abruptly. I felt as if I had been sorted a book. Glad i didn't pay for it."
3,The turtle Boy,Was an interesting story with suspence and drama. The events of the story are pulled together in the dramatic ending.
2,None,"I thought this book was lacking. Although there were some cool and suspenseful aspects to it, the end left a lot to be desired. I didn't feel that the writing was very strong, and there were some plot components that were generic."
1,Depressing,"I thought this dark and depressing, and predictable. I was not happy when I was done reading it.Stupid book.don't waste your time."
1,Ness,"This book was just plain terrible! At first I thought it might be interesting; thinking it would be about boys going on an adventure and finding somthing unexpected. I have no idea why this book is getting five stars..There is no ending to the book, and it lacks a lot of explanation. Just don't waste your time..really! I have read many books off the free list, and have finished even the ones I thought were not the best. Wish I would have stopped reading this one."
2,The Turtle Boy,"Seldom have I actually put a book down before completing it, but this was one that I forced myself through 3 or 4 chapters before crying""Uncle"". I will not be buying any more of this author's books!"
5,Loved it,"I thought this book was awesome! I had a hard time putting it down. Timmy's visits to the the pond, where children are not allowed to play brings on an interesting chain of events leading to the discovery of a crime that happened years ago. A little creepy and dark, but held my interest. I love the details he gave and the feelings it brought on. Great read."
5,AMAZING,this book was amazing good for pre teens and adults alike!!!!! if your looking for a good series this is a good one to start.....
4,stay with it,"This story, to me, started off slow but I am glad I stuck with it. By the time it took off, it literally took off! This story took me into a journey that held my attention and captivated me with its vividness and mystery. It was a fairly quick read which surprised me too. And although there was a conclusion to this book you can find more adventures of Timmy in novellas already written."
5,Interesting!,I found this story very well written and interesting! Fast moving and descriptive. It held my attention-which is pretty short- and kept me interested in the story. I will be reading more from this series!
2,good short read,If you need something to read but be finished rather quickly this book is for you. Loved the story. Cant wait to start on the other books. The characters stick with you leaving you wanting more.
3,the middle got a bit mushy,the story was strong until about the middle I really liked the introspective tone and originality to that point. I lost interest after that
3,Potential,"It showed potential. The story of 2 boys summer adventure turns to horror and mystery. The plot twists turns as truth is revealed unfortunately, it was in the last few pages, and not well done. I was left very sorry Id stayed up until 1am to finish it..."
1,disturbing,The turtle boy was very disturbing. I do not recommend reading this book. Just sayin... it is free for a reason.
3,Didn't love it,Story was to dark sounding for me not sure where it was going but didn't read it to find out
1,not my,Turtle Boy is not the kind of book I like to read...very graphic and it seemed a little frightening to me....
4,Creepy read,"The Turtle Boy is unlike any other book I have read. It's told through Timmy's point of view, an 11 year old boy, with some simple insights that capture things that adults would have trouble articulating. It also has a creepy element that sneaks up on you rather than terrorizing you. It reminded me of a few movies, and I won't tell you which ones for fear of spoiling anything, but it is done in an innovative way that keeps it from seeming formulaic. This kind of fantastic suspense is not my normal kind of book, but this story is so well done and so unusual that you should try it."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this book! I loved that the writing was very descriptive. I guess my only complaints are that the rich character presentation we saw in the beginning of the story sort of petered out at the end, and that, after Turtle Boy got his revenge on Pete's dad, the book basically skipped the aftermath involving Timmy. We just know that the world found out he saw dead people. We never heard Timmy's perspective on the whirlwind following the incident at the pond. I felt sort of cheated, and I felt that it shortened the book, which could have been longer and more detailed in the end. Other than those things, I really enjoyed the read, and am looking forward to reading the next installment in the Timmy Quinn Series."
2,lost me at the end,Would have been good if the author had not finished the story so abruptly. Then they advertise the next book but you're stilll looking to see what happens from the last one.
4,the turtle boy,i enjoyed the turtle boy by kealan patrick nice pace read just enough guessing and decent ending. i look forward to reading more in the timothy quinn series.
2,Not one of my favorites for sure.,This book did nothing for me. I found it boring and almost annoying at the attention given to mundane things and no attention to more important details. I know this is a series.. but I won't be venturing out for the next ones.
2,The Turtle Boy,"I guess I am just not into strange situations that seem to have insidious little monsters coming out of the water. The plot was not bad, but I really did not enjoy the book."
2,Murder mystery,It's got a good story line. I would recommend it to anyone interested in murder mysteries. It could use more detail though.
4,Dark!,"Enjoyed the quick read...more or less engrossing tale. However the story takes a little while to develop, does not seem to have a clear focus until three-quarts of novel. Ended on a very dark and sinister note with somewhat haunting aftertaste!"
2,Not good enough to get book 2,This started out very well but midway it just became weird. I didn't like the ending at all and for a short story I thought it should have had more impact start to finish.
4,Started out to be very well written but the ending was hurried,"I was loving the first half of this story I felt the author hurried the ending and in some places it became very confusing in spots. In the beginning the author gave a very good story developing the characters and setting the scene up and then it became rushed, my sister read it and loved it."
2,Horror seen through a child,"Quick read. Can be long in scene description.Teen level read with graphic language, suggested for high school not junior high"
2,Just good enough to keep me reading.....,I liked the book but the author used way too many adjectives. Almost like the author was being too dramatic at times . That is the only complaint about the book that I have. Other than that it was a great story and I'm ready to start reading the next
2,Confusing,This was a strange and confusing short book to me. The book was just starting to get interesting and then it ended abruptly. I am glad I got this for free to try it out. I probably would not purchase and read any additional stories about Timmy Quinn after reading this one.
3,depressing,It was ok....then it got hard to follow. I found the story line depressing. Much like 6th sense....talking to the dead not what I like.
2,Didn't get it....,I understand being left with questions after reading a thriller like this... but I'm just confused. Was a quick read.
3,Good presentation but lack of any 1.8T info,"Very well written stuff, especially for non-experts. The forced induction chapter very well covered, but outdated. It is a pitty this book does not give any in-depth info for the famous VW/Audi 1.8T engine. The only reference is on page 22 where the legend says that the new 1.8T may be the wave of the future (although it is released since 1997) BUT mistakenly the photo shows the V5 engine instead of the 1.8T. Very unfortunate to refer to an engine just announced, and not mentioning the state-of-the-art 1,8T being in production since 97... Any way someone may fing a lot of usefull information in this book, although primarily adressed to American owners."
3,Water Cooled Performance Handbook,"This is a good book for general information, but many of the pictures are outdated, and the author fails to incorporate discussions of the newer technology. There are a few new photos, and a limited amount of focus on the newer cars on this ""Revised"" version."
4,Terrific for entry level,"This book covers small modifications to sweeten your VeeDub ride. I consider it entry-level, but a good start on your way to be the number one fast of the furious. Bwah ha ha ha!"
1,Quicksand 314SS Painted Surfaces Sanding Block,This quicksand was too rough. I actually gouged the wood. I had one that left a nice finish and got into the crevices of the furniture being sanded.
4,Hynninen and Helsinki Orchestra,"Not sure how important the solo parts are in the vocals. but you can't do better than Hynninen. The work is long and I usually only have time for the third movement.Berglund is fine, I rate the work itself at 4 stars. It is the young Sibelius and still stuck in the romantic era and a bit too Tchaikovskian for me. On the other hand, if you know Finnish, this is an outstanding piece of drama from the Kalevala. If it were not in Finnish I probably would lose intrest half way thru. (which happens with all the ones in Swedish!)I finally got to playing each of the parts followed by the Vänskä recording of the same. I slightly prefer this one. The vocal parts I am not a good judge of as far as performance."
4,Excellent introduction to the intial psychiatric interview,Fundamentals introduces diagnositic interviewing in a simple and straightforward manner. The chapter on the mental status exam is one that I return to many times. It alone makes the book worthwhile. The psychodynamic and characterological aspects are not to the level of other older texts (i.e MacKinnon and Michels). Overall this book has been very useful to me as a psychiatry resident. It is as important to have at the desk as Kaplan and Sadock's textbook.
3,Not Minicraft,"I ordered and was confirmed to receive a Minicraft 1/200 model. I did receive 1/200 Hughes H4, but it was not a Minicraft model. Anyway, I built it and it turned out fine."
3,"Good reference book, lacks part numbers","If you are working on an older snowblower, this book covers the basics for repairs and adjustments. This book has great illustrations with each part identified by name, but it lacks the corresponding part numbers for the parts. A list of brands and models covered in the description would also be a plus. It doesn't cover the Gilson 835 that I bought it for, but it does have the Gilson 55012 (new model of the same machine), which helps, but there are a few differences that were made in the parts used. It still a good reference book on older machines, but part numbers would have made it a 5 star rating instead of 3."
4,OUTDATED...time for an UPDATE!,"Great manual, however, it is now outdated. This book only covers snowthrowers up to 1990. That's over 20 years ago!! It's time for a 4th Edition to cover snowthrowers built over the last 20 years."
4,Good reference book if you are handy,"I think it is a good reference book. It has a lots of pictures with detail description. But you need be handy and have a good knowledge of small engine repairs. Also have some good tools will make your repair job much easier. I used this book mainly for my Honda snowblowers (HS55, and HS70). I used it to change the belts and how to adjust the belts tension. I think it is well worth $20."
4,"If you love the 2001 Patriots, read this book!","I agree with both Michael Pearsall's 5-star review and C Baker's 3-star review. Like Pearsall, ""I loved this book."" Like C Baker, however, I too believe ""It does a poor job of building drama and excitement.""If you're a Patriots fan, you will definitely enjoy this book for its many revealing stories about your (and my) favorite team. But the book doesn't quite tell the team's miraculous story (which is so incredible that Hollywood would have rejected a script based on it as unbelievable) in a way that draws in readers who are not already fans of Belichick's Patriots."
5,One Amazing album!,"B. B. King / Great Moments with B. B. King: The title don't lie, this CD is FILLED with great moments with B. B. during 1965 to 1967. This is just TOO GOOD to pass up.Five Stars"
3,"Interesting premise, mediocre novel.","Alison Anderson's ""Hidden Latitudes"" does have a interesting premise, that Amelia Earhart survived and lived on a small island in the Kiribati islands, and she has been marooned for so long that she no longer wishes to leave. A unhappy married couple stops at the island to repair their boat, and they soon discover that they are not alone, but they are afraid and annoyed by their ""visitor"". They argue and we find ourselves uninterested in them. Ending is kind of muddled"
5,Hidden Lattitudes are a fabulous read!,"In the hugeness of the Pacific ocean, the sky & an unnamedisland, a hushed and musing voice speaks to us of 40 years ofsolitude, of watching & waiting for a white sail to hove to on the horizon, enter the lagoon & come into the calm reaches of the island. A couple with a stale marriage are on board & marooned while they repair their vessel, the watcher remembers. Deeply magical, fascinating & thoughtful. Lovely stuff!..."
4,Fascinating novel when the focus is on Earhart,"There are two stories told here -- that of Amelia Earhart and her experiences being stranged on a deserted island after crashing her airplane with her navigator, and that of a young married couple nearly shipwrecked on that same island but unaware of her presence there.When the story focuses on Earhart, it's fascinating and heart breaking, the story of a woman left to survive for 40 years on her memories and ingenuity. When the story shifts to the couple, it's far too soap opera-ish. Frankly, you never grow to know or like this whiney couple enough to care much about their problems.Still, the author is a skilled wordsmith and although leisurely paced, the novel has enough evocative descriptions that the story will stay with me a long time."
5,Another great offering from MR.HALL,"In the vain of the best of white electric BLUES, HALL plays some blistering guitar and writes some of the best blues tunes of recent times.Besides the wicked sense of humour that flows through most of these songs, he also knows how to tell a story while creating some excellent electric blues. I dare you to find something quite as funny as MY BABY'S A PIG or a story as harrowing as THE GHOST OF JAMES BELL on any other BLUES cd. I have about a 1000 and HALL's cd's ranck with the best of them.I hope he get's the recognition he deserves. Both his CD's are must haves for BLUES fans."
3,"Definitely worth reading, original, creative writing","From renovwed publisher, City Lights books, comes a collection of stories taken from the journal Top Stories, compiled by Anne Turyn. Some of the most original writers of the 80's amd 90's are represented here, from Gary Indiana to Donna Wyszomierski. Readers should be forewarned that some of these selection are excerpts rather than the full stories, and for that reason I do feel compelled to give this one only 3 stars but writers or readers looking for examples of some of the most innovative and original writing out there should have a look at this one."
2,Not the best favor book,"Albeit, the book layout and format is easy to understand, however, the type of favors in this book are for first time crafters, who need to know the basics. There is a materials list and detailed instructions, however, I did not find much inspiration nor ""flair"" from many the favors in this book. Now if you really looking for unique favors, try Favors (leisure Arts #3390) paperback."
2,humorous but redundant,This book is written from the point of view of someone who doesn't like cats. It's amusing but not laugh-out-loud funny.
4,Good lanyard,Good lanyard for USB (thumb) drives. Has a convenient quick disconnect feature.The shipping charge on this item is high.
3,"nice lanyard, but...",Nice little lanyard. I bought several as I use different mp3 players for each music or podcast type. One of the lanyards came with a string too short to loop back over the plastic clip. This made it a real pita to use.It's the little things that make a difference.
3,leaky pump,"I love the dragonfly bathroom set, the bamboo and ceramic contrast looks great and very organic. However, unfortunately the pump on this soap dispensor spontaneously leaks liquid soap onto the counter top. I'm willing to deal with it, since it looks so great!"
1,"Unless you want it just for looks, do not buy","It leaks constantly, that is if you can get one that comes unbroken. I've went thru 4 and was told by the company they were taking them off the market. Obviously not."
4,It looks wonderful on the Kitchen table,"We use this to serve ice water at meals. It is so beautiful. It holds a full 2 qts. Not much else to say about it. It is a water pitcher after all. It is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table. We have two, one for each end of the table."
5,I ADORE it!,"I absolutely LOVE this pitcher! It is a bit on the heavy side when it gets full, but it's very sturdy, doesn't chip if you bump it on the edge of the sink, and the mouth is very wide, so it's easy to get your hand in to clean it. In the photo the handle looks a little insubstantial, but it is really very sturdy and strong, I'm never afraid of it breaking. I have the cobalt blue, and like the other reviewers say, photos just don't do the color justice. It's darker on the bottom and fades toward the top."
5,Holds more than water!,"This is a beautiful and decorative addition to any kitchen. It makes a great flower vase! See the customer photo. Suggested by Le Creuset Outlet, Vacaville, CA."
4,We are happy with this purchase,"The pitcher retains the beverage temperature well. BAsed on th eonline image, we thought the colour would be a graded blue, to only discoevr the pitcher was a solid blue from top to bottom.We love the bright vibrant colour and find that it adds to our table at any meal!"
3,accent piece to display on high shelf,"This was purchased to be an accent piece to display on high shelf. Because of the grainy opacity in the body, it would not be suitable for use as a pitcher or for close-up inspection."
4,Beautiful,Loved the product but unfortunately it wasn't securely packaged and it was broken when it was opened. I did it though.
5,A definate buy for anyone wanting to learn remoting,"I was very impressed with this book, it gives a solid foundation to flash remoting, it doesn't matter if you use CF , J2EE, or .net it is all covered nicely.I am very happy that it is not just a do this then this then this and you get this, but it goes into the why you did that to get that, not many books I have do that.It even includes 3 of the most sought after applications involving online presence, the message board the email client as well as teh ecommerce solution.This book is a '+' if you are wanting to get into flash remoting then this is the difinitive guide."
1,Not this desperate,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers were thinking.The coldfusion examples were horrible and full of errors.In the recordSet section we are told. ""Instead of setting up a database and returning records we'll create a recordset and pretend it came from a database"" so the actual returning of a recordset doesn't happen. There are not many books on remoting yet, I'd wait for a good one and use the Flash remoting tutorials on macromedia's site."
2,It would have been just what I needed if....,"any of the examples worked!! I was so relieved to find the book when I scanned its index in the book before buying in the store.When I attempted to apply ANY of the examples; as others have mentioned, some examples were missing from the downloads for the book, and when I spent lengthy time typing the actionscript, checking and double checking, none of the examples worked 100% like they said they would.It was very frustrating to have read a chapter, apply the examples, and flip the page to read something to the effect of ""Well, that's it!. After what we have just covered, Flash and Coldfusion integration doesn't get much harder than that"".I really wish the authors would have taken the time to ensure the examples, both printed and on their website actually worked before publishing the book!"
1,Unbelievable,This was very disappointing. I don't know why Joey Lott even bothered as a lot of whats in this book DOESN'T WORK! A total waste of time and money.
3,Only So-So,"Lasted less than a year before I had to replace them due to rust. Light weight enough that they kept jumping off the rod when sliding the curtain back and forth. They are cute and I love dragonflies, but these are cheap and you get what you pay for."
3,Loved the product but not the quality,Love the hooks. They are so cute and match my bathroom exactly. But the quality is lacking. The hooks fell off two of the dragonflys. Another one fell onto a bath run and broke.
3,Served the purpose,One hook as already broke by just dropping on a tile floor. I would not recommend these hooks for everyday use
1,Don't order through Beall's,I ordered this from an Amazon Marketplace seller called Beall's which is a department store in Florida. They said that it was in stock. When I never recieved notice that it had shipped I contacted them and they were not friendly nor were they apologetic when telling me that they canceled the order because the item was unavailable. I had not received any notice that Beall's had canceled the order.
5,very satisfied,flowers came the day I've requested. Very-very fresh as just picked. My mother was happy.
3,"Nice flowers, HORRIBLE customer service!!","I bought these for my sister for her birthday. I'm told the flowers were lovely and arrived fresh-looking. That being said, I selected a delivery date when ordering, then got notification five days early that they were being prepared to ship. I contacted customer service for the flower market three times asking for verification that they would not ship until my order date. I got no response. It wasn't until I stated I was leaving somewhat negative feedback that they responded, and had no explanation for the shipping issue."
3,A helpful Guide,"Easy to read, seems to offer somewhat valuable information on art history. Very specifically focused on college art history students, although it would probably work fine for many high school courses. I purchased it for a class and considering the price, it seems worth it."
2,Outrageously expensive,"Outrageously expensive price for a book of only 180 pages.I made the mistake of not checking how long the book was.There isn't anything particularly special about this book. I don't really understand why it costs so much, it comes from Prentice Hall-so maybe you are paying for the glossy paper and pictures. I don't know.One could learn more from Wikipedia articles at no price at all!"
1,Do not buy this TV,"I bought the TV about an year back. I am deeply dissatisfied with its performance.For the last few months, the TV would just hang - neither the remote nor the TV controls would work. I had to pull the plug on the TV to restart it. This kept happening every 3 days.Today, the remote control buttons for the channel change stopped working. I have to keep going to the TV controls to change the channels. This is very frustrating.I recommend that you do not buy this TV - if you do, atleast get the two year home service warranty so that you can get it fixed if the problem shows up within a reasonable time."
3,Too Much Admiration,"The author was one of a coterie of Western journalists and Old China Hands who covered China in the 1920s and '30s. Although they were of many political colors, they all came to admire the Communist Chinese for their military abilities, organizational skill, fair dealings with the peasants, and the fact that they, unlike the Kuomintang, were genuinely willing to fight againse the Japanese. This admiration was merited, but Agnes goes overboard. A Communist true believer, she writes an adulatory book about the noble heroes of the Chinese Revolution, and thereby robs them of their individuality. They are all brave and intelligent and dedicated and honorable and decidedly boring. I'm no Red-hater, but you're better off with Edgar Snow, or even Anna Louise Strong, an equally-devoted Travelling Commie who knew how to draw an interesting character."
1,Guess I got the wrong one too!!,"I am also one of the unlucky ones who got a bad drill bit. Ordered from kingofgamesdvds and got the bad black bit. I contacted the company who swiftly returned my money and even sent me another bit. Needless to say the new bit worked for one game and then stripped out.This may be a good bit from another distributor (Maybe should've tried JJGames like others suggested), but it didn't work out very well for me. Good luck!!"
2,Not worth it.,"This is one I should have listened to the reviews on. Maybe it's a gamble, I don't know. People have said they got the stainless one and it worked amazing, well I got the black one. First off it barely fits in the hole for the screw, and when you twist it shaves plastic off the game cartridge inside the screw hole. It looks like it's stripping out but so far is working, I've only opened two cartridges so far with this thing and it looks like junk in the end of it. II'm afraid to open more cartridges in case it strips out and I can't get them put back together. Going to look for something else."
2,Disappointing result. Is this a mistake?,"I ordered a new 3.8mm game security bit for $7...and I received a used, scratched, slightly rusty, nearly stripped item. After 1 use, half of the driver head had been worn down. Considering what it looks like, it performs admirably. Seems like the steel construction of this item focused on strengthening the shaft of the bit, rather than toughening the driver head. It does it's job for now, but I don't know how much longer it will last.Every other review for this product is positive...is my result a mistake? This item looks used...Edit: I have contacted the merchant, and they offered to send me another bit. I will edit this review later."
5,:),My poor distraught fiancee has been tearing his hair out because his Pokemon games won't save anymore. This has helped us so much!
1,It just plain sucks,I bought it to replace an old battery in a copy of metroid 2. When it came the bit was in an unopened bag. I looked at the bit and it was stripped. Save your $ do not buy.
3,double check,"if you're getting this for a n64, it only works on the screws for the ram and games. It will not open the console. I was surprised, but not disappointed."
5,Great Tool,I bought this to fix my nintendo Nes games and found that I can use it to fix my GameBoy games as well. Wish the batteries were just as cheap.
2,Gets the job done...,"I read the previous reviews about the bit being made hastily and not centered, etc. My product (from Classic Game Source) arrived in similar condition - the imprint in the bit is definitely off-center, and a couple of the ""teeth"" are even non-existent. However, I still got the screw off my GameBoy games by hand with the bit... so I can't be 100% displeased..."
5,Cleaned up 20 games last weekend,"This thing does exactly what it's supposed to do. It allowed me to take apart all my NES games and resurface the contacts, using a fiberglass scratch pen. It's made of steel, so it seems pretty reliable."
3,"Bit Don't Fit, You Must Acquit","Doesn't fit Virtual Boy security screwsBought this to crack open my Nintendo Virtual Boy for some repair work ... Problem is it doesn't fit as specified in the description. Notified seller of this erro, hopefully it will be resolved."
4,HJRodrigo,"It works. The fit was a little loose on some screws, but applying more downward force as I unscrew solved that problem."
3,Returned this,Not what I was looking for. Print too small to be useful for young people I was getting them for. Would rather spend more and get a nicer copy of the scriptures - and so I returned it and got something else!
1,Offensive and uncivilised,"Call me a prude. I expected constructive descriptions about the founding and growth of a landmark virtual community. The vulgarity and coarsenes of this book, both in language and treatment of topic matter, is gratuitous and offensive. Are virtual communities this uncivilised? I should think not.One star is too many."
1,Couldn't be farther from the truth,"This book clearly distinguishes between the concept of a virtual community in Stacy Horn's mind, and the true experience of being a member of one of the premier virtual communities. Unfortunately, only the former is really covered in Cyberville--to get a remote understanding of the latter, you would need to look elsewhere."
1,Orange Guard stains!,"For heaven's sake, don't spray it on a wall unless the wall is painted with gloss paint. With flat paint, Orange Guard leaves a stain!"
1,Slippery Film and Bad Smell....BEWARE!,"Ok...I purchased this to kill the spiders in my house because I thought it would be effective and safe for use around my kids. Waited wayyyyyy toooooo long for the package to arrive. When it finally came, I sprayed doorways and windows and thresholds. Now my entire house, inside and out, smells horrible, has a opaque film in the areas sprayed (slippery on floors and porches), and the spiders are just as alive and happy as ever. This stuff does NOT work on spiders. Now I have to clean everywhere I sprayed, investing tons of time, and I still have spiders...argh!!!!!! Aslso, does not seem to work on any other bug I've sprayed...even point blank. Just makes them smell bad.....very bad!"
3,Not working the way it should,"I've used this product several times, and it works as far killing bugs sooner rather than later, but it doesn't seem to work for preventing them from entering your household. I've used it both inside and outside the house. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. However it does smell pretty good."
3,Awesome God,This book makes you realize that you can never be disappointed with God. As people we sin and hurt each other and there is much pain on earth but disappointed with God Never. He loved us enough to die for us.
3,No Longer Dissappointed!,"No longer dissappointed with God, all I need to know is that God is still God and His ways are definitely not our ways Thank the Lord! Because if it was up to foolish me I'd have taken away cancer from someone I love and given it to someone else for very selfish reasons. This book has many good points but frankly it's wasn't that helpful to me. I read it but I could put it down... a lot."
2,I didn't like this book very much,"I had high hopes for this book but it disappointed me! It was too wordy and hard to understand and I came away feeling like I had learned nothing and had no answers. I didn't like the way he ""humanized"" God."
5,Appointment with God,"I have to confess that there was a time in my life that I was too proud to even pick up a book with this title. I was on a ""happy pill"" and just would not admit to such ""blasphemous weakness"". I was wrong. Philip Yancey has put words to questions I can not even utter and guided me to answer them using God's revelation in Scriptures. This book has challenged and changed the way I see things, and you do not even have to be disappointed with God to appreciate it."
5,Honest and insightful,"No book is going to deal with the problem of pain more eloquently than the book of Job. Yancey's book, however, complements Job nicely. People find Yancey's writings helpful because he is candid, articulate, well read, and as much as anything, practical, preferring to tackle our real disappointments and doubts rather than glossing them over with a coat of theological chutzpah. Like many titles, this book grew out of Yancey's real life encounters, in this case a graduate student who showed up in his Chicago apartment one day in a simmering rage against God. Yancey's book explores and suggests explanations to help us find our way in life, even when we don't understand. Strongly recommended."
4,very good,"I have to say I am fascinated and love the way philip yancey is willing to look at all the questions that they dont like to talk about at church. I personally enjoyed reading this book, I think in the end he was saying God is probably dissapointed in his relationship with us and maybe its not God that is unfair but life itself. I think the truth is none us know for sure, cuz were not God and he hasnt spoken to any of us about it. lol. So I think knowing that there will never be a book that completely satisfies our questions for God, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to his thoughts and ideas."
5,Disappontment with God,"It was as expected. It is a very interesting book, and it is obvious that the author has put a lot of thought and given insight"
3,"Easy, informative for the average reader.","Fits better with the traditional christian view of God as all powerful creator. Brings together thoughts from diverse sources in a storytelling and dialogue style. Contains insights. Early chapters too elementary and folksy for my preferences. Gets better and digs deeper in later chapters. Would like to know more about the bare bones structure of his premise in the early parts and then see the flesh, shape and form added as the chapters progress."
2,Disappointed,"Even though I am a Christian, as many, the more I study I still keep coming back to the same question: Why?I have read many books on the topic. I had heard about Yancey's books so I gave it a try. Unfortunately just as many booksbefore I was disappointed. Yancey is just giving his own twist on the whole idea but does not come up with any decent answers.don't waist your time and money."
1,STILL ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT !!!,"AS SOMEONE ALSO LOOKING FOR RENEWED FAITH I CHOOSE THIS BOOK AND FOUND THE SAME RESULT ""NOTHING"" LIKE ALL BOOKS THEY DO NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WE ARE HAVING.THE BOTTOM LINE COMES ON PAGE 257 CHAPTER 27 WHEN RICHARD SAIDS SPEAKING ON JOB, BUTS THERES ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEENS JOBS STORY AND MINE.FOR ALL HIS TROUBLES,JOB FINALLY DID RECEIVE A WORD FROM GOD.HE HEARD AN ACTUAL VOICE OUT OF THE WHIRLWIND.BUT FOR ME,GOD STAYED SILENT.AND I GUESS THATS WHY JOB CHOSE TO BELIEVE AND I CHOSE NOT TO.THIS BOOK OR ANY BOOK OR HUMAN CAN GIVE US THAT,ITS A PERSONAL THING WE EACH MUST KNOW AND EXPERIENCE !!!!!"
3,A Good Book,"I like the book. Unfortunately, Yancey makes a number of statements that I would describe as Arminian. From my point of view, a slightly more Calvinistic attitude yields more satisfying answers in that God has a purpose in everything. Still, I agree with Yancey's overall conclusions regarding the heavenly significance of the problems here on earth, and he expresses himself well on this score, so I do like the book and can recommend it as offering some good insights."
1,"Right questions, no answers","This book asks the right questions, but fails to provide the answers. There's nothing of much meaning at all here."
5,Excellent read,"I highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are going through some hard times and are questioning God's plans and interferences.I loved every minute of reading it, it's not an easy read, but worth it definitely."
3,Not my favorite by Yancey,This book started out great but descended into a silly explanation of pitying God instead of feeling disappointed in Him. I must admit I didn't finish it because of the direction it took.
4,Disapointment with GOD,"A good book but the scripture is at the end of the chapter,which the author is aware and did this on purpose,otherwise a good book for answers that people need when tradgey happens."
5,Long for Harmony No More!,"Longing for the Harmonies: That's what physicists do. This book, in fact, pretty much sums up what physics is, at heart, about: a search for connection and clarity, a series of variations on themes, the interplay of tension and release, mystery and discovery--the universe's own fugue. Frank Wilczek-who recently won the Nobel prize for puzzling out how quarks glom together-and Betsy Wilczek-writer, blogger, math whiz--have composed an entrancing work that captures both the substance and process of understanding."
5,Great storage,Loved this CD storage. I have enough room for another and I plan to get it. Good product.
3,Don't believe the hype,"Contrary to all the other reviews you see here, I found this product hard to use. The sleeves flop all over the place and it is hard to put CDs in this case. Trust me -- a Cd binder is much easier to use.On the plus side, it seems well made."
5,Great product!,Well made and serves the purpose effectively. I use it to organize my DVD collection and like the fact that I can add additional disks wherever I need so I can maintain my alphabetical organization for easy finding.
5,At Last - ALL The Little King Cartoons In One Place!,"A complete collection of the Van Beuren Studios' ""Little King"" cartoons has long been on my video ""want"" list. Well, Thunderbean has delivered the goods IN SPADES! Not only do we have all of the Van Beuren L.K. titles, but we have two ""Sentinel Louie"" precursor cartoons plus the Fleischer Studios' one and only L.K. appearance with Betty Boop.Thunderbean has assembled this collection by searching out the best-looking and best-sounding prints from a world-wide network of archives and collectors. It's AMAZING that a collection assembled with this level of care and effort could be had at such a reasonable price!If you love vintage cartoon rarities, do not fail to seek out this collection."
3,Not impressed,I am not impressed with the quality of this product for the price (It looks somewhat cheap).
3,"Nicely written, but not quote-worthy","It is clear that author Simon Ramo has much experience in attending meetings, and through that experience, he is able to impart some excellent advice. For example, he relates a story of how he, as a young professional, nearly blew it by aggressively speaking his mind in a meeting attended by older, more established team members.On the negative side, the book containd little independent data, poll results, or quotes that might have lent authority to the author's own views. (I doubt that I will be quoting parts of this book to co-workers.) Also, the last two chapters, on government meetings and corporate ethics, seemed to drift badly off-topic. Still, overall, a good book."
4,WOW!,"A delightful collection of poetry from the talented writers working at Georgia's excellent site, LadyBugBooks.com An auspicious start in the multi-media format. Look forward to a Vol.3"
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I bought this 1G card thinking I could take short videos with my digital camera, got the H version thinking it would store the video faster than the current M versions that I have. The few videos that I have tried to get with this H card have not turned out well at all, I can't get the sound and the video to synch, the sound is lagging behind the video, which it doesn't do with the 512Mb M card that I have."
5,1GB Xd picture card Type H,I am very pleased with my purchase of the picture card. It is excellent! And i even got it for the lowest price that i could find on amazon.com compared to other merchants. The picture card holds about 100 pictures and that is perfect for me.
1,Shipped the wrong product,"I was shipped the wrong product, when I informed them, they were out of stock. Make sure to check and see if they sent you the wrong product. What was in my box was an SD card"
4,xD high speed,"Haven't use the m version, but í think if H type is high speed never buy the m type for your digital camara. I like the panoramic photos that are availeble with the olympus brand xD."
5,NICE CARD,"I use this card in my Fuji F31FD. Nice card. Faster than M type cards (noticeably faster in downloading photos to your computer, not significantly faster in camera).Recommended."
5,Great card!,"This is a great addition to my Olympus digital camera. Picture quality is excellent. Doesn't slow my camera down and no more worries about filling my memory. I can save over 800 pictures so if I don't have time to download, it will still last my whole vacation or event."
2,Had to return,"The card was not formatted correctly so I ended up returning it. I am sure it was just a factory defect, and in general this card works fine."
5,Great Deal !,Can't say a single bad thing about the memory. Its been flawless so far and the price was fantastic. Buy it without regrets.
5,1GB Xd Picture Card Type H,I bought this for my granddaughter to use in the digital camera that I had given her for Christmas. She was very happy to get this picture card.
1,Can't return if opened,I purchased an Olympus camera which broke after one weeks use and can't return the accessories purchased with the camera because they were opened.Duh. You have to open them to use them! So I have accessories and no camera.
1,isn't compatible,"Not only did olympus have to create it's own proprietary memory card, they made different versions not compatible with each other.I can't use this with my C5050. What moron decided not to make this backwards compatible!"
2,Description says SanDisk - received Fujifilm,"OK, most people probably don't care what brand of card they get, but I do. As of this writing this product is listed as a Sandisk card, which is what I wanted, but I received a Fujifilm card.To their credit, Digital Media Source promptly refunded me the difference in price between the two items ($12.00)."
4,"Nice, but wears the batteries out quicker","CAPACITY: It's nice to not have to swap cards out as often on our (now-way-out-dated 2 y.o. 5mp) camera. It does hold a lot of pictures, even at the finest settings.POWER HOG: But it seems to make the camera work harder ... thus wearing the batteries out sooner. (Gotta switch to rechargables.)ISSUES: Also, oddly enough, when we started using this card, the camera now freezes up occasionally. Either as it's sending the lens out, thus unable to focus until the camera is turned off and back on again (if you can), or it just plain freezes all processes. It takes a minute before we can power it off, sometimes only by dis-/reconnecting the batteries."
5,Absolutely outstanding music,I first heard Mr. Jones's music in the soundtrack to The General's Daughter. It was haunting and unforgettable. A couple of months ago I learned that he had expanded upon and released a CD of his modern adaptation of field and folk music recorded in the 30's and 40's and ordered it immediately. It gets under your skin and won't let you go--but not in the way that brain worms from commercials can do! I will keep a lookout for any further work done by this unique and wonderful artist.
4,Great Product !,Worked well for our needs. My wife wanted something to store our Christmas ornaments in & cut me loose to find it on the internet. I of course dialed into Amazon & orded 2 of these boxes & they work perfect for needs.
2,Disappointing,"This was just an ordinary plastic bin box with cardboard inserts. Not a special size, shape, or quality. I could have bought the same thing at WalMart for half the price."
4,great boxes,I know these might not be the cheapest but I love them. There is a lot of flexibility on each layer so it will hold allot of different size ornaments. Would buy these again.
3,Russian Karlson is more fun,"When I was a child , KArlson was my favorite book, by far and when I saw a DVD with Karlson cartoon, I bought it on a spot.But after watching it for 5 min, I realized that the Russian Karlson was by far, much better, even though it was a lot shorter.Swedish Karlson lacks the humor, it just simple follow the book, and on the 15 min it became boring"
5,Deeply inspired insights by a profound visionary of our time,Sri Chinmoy's collection of writings in Beyond Within exploresthe personal quest for enlightment. There are insightsand ideas for the uninitiated to the advanced seeker.A must for anyone seeking to better one's life.
4,Love this,I was looking for a stuffed toy that would look like penguin. the features of penguin is really good in this toy. The size is amazing for its price. I m sure everyone would love it. It will definitely make a good birthday gift even for little ones.
5,Great Penguin Toy,My family loves this penguin toy so much! It is really adorable! The size is big enough so that it can be your sleep-toy. It can stand well on the floor. Amazing!
5,Awesome,This penguin has a very expensive look to it. Quality is excellent from the softness to the stitching and the price is very affordable.
5,Great!,"My younger daughter (age 15) bought a penguin at the Baltimore Aquarium last year. When her older sister (age 23) saw it, she wanted one, because she's always been a penguin lover. We looked and looked locally at Christmas and for her birthday in Feb and then easily found one that sounded good (this one) on Amazon. When it arrived, it was IDENTICAL to the one that we bought for $10 more in Baltimore, so even with shipping it still cost $5 less. It's a wonderful product, too...larger and more lifelike than the usual plush penguins you see in stores."
1,Melissa and Doug Penguin Plush,"My daughter likes this stuffed animal because of its size, but it is not durable and is literally coming apart at the seams. She keeps it mainly to look at and it looks in perfect condition, but I just noticed two holes in the seams and I would expect more to come soon. I think Melissa and Doug's quality is slipping a bit and this is not the first time I have heard of this happening. I contacted customer service, but they said there is nothing they can do and judging by the pictures I sent them ""the holes should be able to be stitched up myself"". I expected more from Melissa and Doug. I would not recommend this product unless you plan on fixing this toy yourself."
5,good gift,i gave this to my girl that loves stuffed animels ever siece she got it she has sleeped holding it good buy big toy for lil money good buy
3,just decoration,arrived in timely manner good product just being used as decoration in a gender neutral baby room until we find out the sex good product though nothing wrong with it
4,GREAT,"my daughter who is 14 loves this penguin!! she collects them and she has been wanting a taller one. I have looked and the prices were too much, this one was priced right and she loves it!!!!"
5,Fast Service for a cool Penguin,"My soon to be 7 year old son loves Penguins and this toy/stuffed animal has been perfect for him, he carries it with him to bed and when he wakes up in the morning and really enjoys it. Highly recommended for Penguin lovers!!!"
5,Perfect,"I bought this for my girlfriend due to her love of penguins and stuffed animals. This bad boy arrived fast and it truly is lifesize and while not as cuddly as the real deal is quite cuddly indeed. It's firm, but soft. Stands up on it's own. Highly recommend."
5,Cute penguin,"I bought this for a holiday life size decoration for under the Christmas tree and it's really cute. Its very large as the picture indicates. I don't see any choking hazards about this. It's not heavy at all and is filled with polyester not pellets. It is great if you are looking for a larger than penguin size plush animal, or wish to decorate for the holidays with a penguin motif."
2,Cute but poor quality,I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas and I was very excited when I first opened it. It's very large and realistic and I thought my son would love it. He did! The only problem is that right when he opened it I noticed there is a huge hole where the white material and black material are sewn together. The material is poor quality and so is the stitching. I think maybe Melissa and Doug should stick with their wooden toys rather than plush animals. I don't know how to explain to my son that we'll have to send the penguin back to Santa to have him fix it and send it back :( I am not much for sewing but I'm going to try. This is a cute penguin but not sure it's going to hold up too long since its falling apart after opening.
5,The Perfect Penguin,"This Penguin is pretty tall, big, and soft. In other words it's a perfect penguin. I bought two as presents for x-mas and neither disappointed. At this price, I'd say don't hesitate to pick this one up."
4,Very nice quality and realistic,"This is a very cool bird. And big. This definitely adds to the cool factor. I have a kid just in love with penguins so we were very pleased to find that this is made with great quality fur, stuffed enough to maintain original shape, but still snuggly."
4,Amazed,This stuffed penguin was a great surprise. It was nice and large that my daughter could wrap her arms around it and pick it up like a small child. The colors are very vibrant and made with fairly decent material. Quality is fantastic. I recomend this to everyone.
5,Big hit,This was a big hit birthday gift for my grand daughter. She loves Penguinitta.Its a very large stuffed friend for a 7 year old. Brilliant colors and Amazon has a great selection of other stuffed penguins including babies that I can give for valentine's day and any other special events.I have not seen it in person but in three very clear photos I would have to say I was impressed.
4,Perfect phone for the Princess in your life,"My daughter could not have been more pleased to receive this princess phone for her birthday! It is quite large and does not fit on a nightstand very well, so be prepared to have some space available. It also goes through batteries pretty quickly, but that could be because my princess loves to play the Demo in which the 4 princesses swirl around the tower to classic Disney music and talk to you."
5,An quality product at a low price.,"I purchased this product years ago, and it has lasted through several moves....unprotected. Yet, it keeps on tickin'. The channels are easy to receive and on-screen images are clearly defined. A GREAT gift."
2,"Sticky, smelly, slight color","I really wanted it to work. I put the gel on my legs and waited and waited and waited for it to dry. It never felt completely dry and after 45 minutes, I gave up and had to wash the sticky, smelly mess off. I did get a little color, but not enough to warrant regular use. Will keep looking for a better product."
1,where's the Tan??,"This product doesn't work at all! Of course it can claim that you don't have to wait before dressing because it gives you absolutely NO TAN, and of course it wont streak because it gives you NO TAN! I am not even trying to get an obvious tan, I just want a little naural glow to my legs,I had been using this for the past 5 days now but it doesn't give me any change! I can't believe I paid $35 (Canadian $) for this. This is nothing but a moisturizer. Girls, save your money."
3,Not what I expected.,"Given its price & good reviews I expected a lot more. It's stinky but that fades. I expected a deeper, richer color. It does what it claims & isn't orangey (bonus) but the color is very faint even used every other day. I get the same &/or better results from Loreal Sublime Bronze albeit that tends to be on the orange side. Maybe it's my skin tone..... Worth a try, though."
3,"Streak-free, but barely there.","The tanning gel does apply smoothly and does not leave streaks. However, it doesn't provide much color if you apply it as instructed. And if you apply it every day, it'll be really expensive. Bottom line, not worth the price if you want more than a light touch of color."
3,Decent Self Tanner,"This tanning gel does not deliver much color, but it does have a pleasant odor, smoothes on easily, and doesn't clog my pores. I wish it did a better job of delivering a noticeable ""tan"", but otherwise I think it's a decent product."
2,"Feels sticky, too expensive","I tried this product after reading many great reviews. Unfortunately I find this product to be too sticky after application. It takes a good hour or more for the stickiness to go away. Also, it produces a very light shade and takes several uses before enough color shows up which in turn makes it rather expensive.I would not buy this again since there are so many other self-tanners out there to try."
2,Where is the tan?,"I am now on my third coat, I have yet to see a change in color. True I am fair but I suspected to see something that looked like a tan. Not worth the money."
1,"From texture, to smell, to sticky feel, to no color - got to be the worst one yet...","Honestly.. giving one star feels too much for this product: The acetone smell, was beyond overpowering! Can not tell you anything about the color or the streaks - because if was nearly impossible to get any tan... after applying it for a good week, every night in a row! So after putting up with uncomfortable stickiness, the awful smell - it was very disappointing to see no change in color! Very disappointed about everything in this product - would never ever buy it again.BTW, I've tried them all - top shelf (Dior, Channel, Clinique, etc.,) and have not had any luck until accidentally stumbled across Bare Escentuals Faux Tan. Smell, instant color, overall very happy to finally have that real-looking gorgeous tan! Read up on it! (Highly recommend getting a tan application body buffing brush as well, since it gives an instant tan to the palms of your hands, that is nearly impossible to get rid off...)Good luck!"
2,Disappointed,I tried this and was not too happy with the result. Too pricy for the product. I've tried other products and are far better than this. It didnt really make me tan at all and I am pale white.It felt really uncomfortable when I slept in it also. It didn't smell awful but I will never buy this product again.Definitely wouldn't recommend it!
5,it works,I have tried many of the over the counterself tanners. This is the best I've usedby far. I wish it lasted longer than a fewdays. If you plan well you can keepthe tan going rather easily!
2,"Not bad, but awkward.","This isn't a ""bad"" autobiographical cookbook, but I wouldn't recommend it or purchase it for a gift for a friend. It's an awkward size to thumb through and read and although it's nicely photographed, the content kind of leaves you hanging. Not enough recipes/content to justify cost. Having gone to culinary school in New Orleans, the recipes are right on. So if you're looking for authenticity, this book will do."
4,"Yo, This is good",Enjoyed the unique spin to Cajun food in NYC. Love the recipes for Seasoning. I love a new way to prepare seafoods.
5,scary enough to be real!,"Books that would appear on the surface to be about a Nazi murderer would not usually interest me. However, the premise that AIDS and HIV might be in some way related to the work of the murderer Mengele caught my attention and so I decided to read the book. I was not disappointed. From start to finish, Weinberg convincingly weaves a scientific narrative with an intense trail of deceit and danger. And just when you think the trail has come to an end and you think you finally have it all figured out, the author throws you a curve ball that leaves you wanting more and looking for answers. ..."
2,Should have shown a photo of unopened box,"The purchase process was timely and efficient, but I guess I didn't read this carefully enough; I thought it was an assembled HO scale accessory. It wasn't. It was intended as a gift, and ended up as such, but to a different recipient."
5,I never heard of a ramekin.,"I bought a bunch of LeCreuset and these came as a gift. I suppose you use these for a fancy dessert, I don't know. What I do know is these are very well made and I am going to make jell-o and pudding in them and invite Bill Cosby over."
5,This Book Is Even Creepier Than The Movie!.,"I read this novelization of Halloween, I got it from a used book store and it was one of the best movie tie-in books I ever read and just as good as the movie it's based on. Yes that's right, the movie came first and than the book when it's usually the other way around. This book goes into a lot more detail about Michael Myers and why he is the way he is and does the things he does which kind of makes this book even scarier than the movie and I highly recommend thus book to fans of the Halloween movies! Very creepy!"
5,Simply Classic,When reading Richards work or watching Carpenters classic - you still find that the bogeyman will never be forgotten.
3,Halloween a novel,"The book was pricy, Pages was yellow and the cover fell off in a week but the book was what I was looking for."
2,Tediously Predictable,"The first half is amusing. But like Annette Benning in ""Being Julia"" Maggie Gyllenhall arrogantly chews up the scenery competing against a woman obviously more desirable than herself. I suspect she's also jealous of her famous brother's ease with leading roles while she struggles to elevate supporting roles. She's trying way too hard in the courtroom scene and has zero romantic chemistry with this doctor."
3,"Take it easy gals, don't get hysterical-just get a vibrator!","Humorous look at the history of play toys for women. I thought it was cute, better than just okay. Considering getting a toy of my very own!"
4,Could have been better,"For what they showed, it was a cute movie. All good acting. I feel it could have been a lot better with additional scenes. I could think of about 15 I would have added, but that's because I know something about the business"
3,Weirdly funny!,"Loved Maggie, Felicity and Hugh. Especially liked when they sent a vibrator to Queen Victoria. Great look at Victorian England."
4,"Serious subject, well done with some lightness","I was worried about how this subject would work as a romantic comedy. I think it was charming and interesting. Subject matter is disturbing, but it was a good way to bring about the information to those that were unaware."
4,Hysteria,"It is a feel good movie, no pun intended, ladies. I very much liked this movie although I would have liked to have seen more story about the relationship between the handsome doctor and Maggie's character. I feel like we didn't get to see the budding relationship and it was just thrown on us to be accepted as love."
4,Hysteria,I had previously seen this movie and enjoyed the humor. I decided to purchase it at Amazon for a BD gift. However I was disappointed in the delivery time. Although it was being sent from NJ to NH it took 2 weeks to arrive. It was also 3 days late from the estimated delivery date. My previous purchases from Amazon were received in less than the estimated time and I was very pleased with those items.
1,Bored with the characters,"I really didn't enjoy the characters in the movie. I found myself being bored, but I finished it only because I had rented the movie."
5,Absolutely Entertaining and Educational!,"Hysteria provides a comical explanation of Medical, Mental Health, Sexuality and Invention! I am an adult sexuality educator that shares the story of the evalution of sexual aids on a regular basis! I found this movie to be extremely entertaining as well as educational, with a bit of a love story mixed in. I would suggest that all women to watch this film. If you loved the movie and would like to learn more and have a great Night-In of fun with your girlfriends, visit my website: [...] to schedule a party with me or another Consultant in your area!"
2,Trailer was funnier than the film,"Really no story, just one long kinda smutty joke that loses its punch early on. Would not re-watch nor recommend to a friend."
4,Victorian Ladies,"The movie does very well in showing how women, especially upperclass women, were viewed by men. Women were put into a box where they were expected to perform their housewifely duties, childcare, put up with sex and overbearing husbands and be profoundly happy. If they rebelled they were called hysterical and mentally unbalanced due to their ""overactiveuterus."" In this movie a couple of doctors made a great living out ofa very controversial cure. I found the movie hilarious and the actors did a good tongue-in-cheek performance.Buy it - it shows how far we have come and will give you a few laughts if you are not too shocked."
5,Hysteria,"A real hoot, great comedy movie, tells of how the ""vibrator developed"" or as a line in the movie goes, you are going to need a bigger appointment book."
5,Cute and Charming film!,"I was weary of this film when I read the description, but decided to give it a try. It is an adorable, well made, classy film, especially considering the subject matter. It was very interesting and kept my attention, and the story was great."
5,Very well done,"This treats an important part of medical history with tact and humor.""Hysteria"" was a diagnosis to women with any variety of complaints - ""hyster"" being he root word for hysterectomy explains the connection.Treatment consisted of massage to relieve tensions and the women all seemed to feel so much better after the treatments and found they need to return often for more treatments.This movie explains the development of the personal vibrator."
5,"History made fun, and it's true.","The viewing of this story brought together for me certain individual facts and events that had come to my atteniton over several decades. It was fun to view, and the subject is handled with both discression and humor. A happy purchase."
3,Cute Movie,"Funny and insightful look into the past. Surprisingly, I learned a lot about the history of ""women's"" health and the origin of dildos."
5,Entertaining!,"I enjoyed this DVD's storyline. Funny and sweet, yet the subject matter, the invention of the modern vibrator, is based on fact. Always wondered about swooning, fainting couches, and why women were treated and imprisoned for many maladies that were solved ingeniously. The movie can be watched even with young kids in the room, as it is not racy in any way. My husband thought it funny, and passing it on to my grown daughter, and later to my friends, all enjoyed its humor and history! Check out Wikpedia or history books to learn more about the history, but buy it and and I bet you will have a good laugh!"
4,Leaves You Spinning...Pun Definitely Intended.,"This is quite the eye opener (although at times you will try and wish you could shut them). A perfect husband and wife date night film--close the doors--don't let the kids near and do have alcohol close by. Husband's jaw was in the dropped down position most of night, followed by unhinged laughter. We both enjoyed the historical viewpoint and I found myself entirely humbled to be living in this day and age. You'll be amazed at how far science has progressed within 100 years. Leave it to the Brits to determine vibrators are for medicinal purposes--I'm sure it's still on national healthcare! On a serious note, the film delivers what it needs, in the perfect time frame, with the perfect characters and approaches an array of hormonal imbalances with whit and entertaining humor for both genders...which is always the best medicine! All in all ""Jolly Molly Good""."
3,Cute and funny,This movie was very cute. If you are looking for something light and fun to watch pick this one. Maggie is wonderful as a passionate powerful woman in that time era.
4,Great little film,"Wonderful performances - lovely little history lesson -- very funny & charming. Maggie G gives a stellar performance (I think one of her best, actually) as does Hugh and the rest of the cast. Very well done. Definitely worth watching."
4,Great girl's night IN movie,"My friends and I all enjoyed this movie very much...of course we are in the ""middle-aged"" target population this movie is all about...we found it to be very funny. All th eactors do a great job."
4,An amusing tale about personal massagers,This is a funny look at the invention of the electric sex toy. The examination of the social issues of the time that necessitate its invention are also interesting to watch.
4,"For lovers of the ""Hans Zimmer Music""","For those who enjoyed the wonderful orchestral pieces from ""True Romance"", I suggest you take a listen to ""Carl Orff Schulwerk Vol.1/Musica Poetic"". This is much better. The music on the True Romance cd, as good as it is, is merely a rip off."
3,Just Okay,"I thought I would know more songs on this cd but I knew about 2, I ordered it for one in particular and just hoped I would like the rest but not so much, it's okay but I wish I could have just found the one song on itunes and bought it there instead of buying this whole cd but apparently the one song I was looking for by this specific artist is not so common and this was the only place I could find it and I really searched for the download."
4,A Satisfying Biography,"Dorothy Dandrige's friends hated this book and I can't understand why. Earl Mills, knew her as well, if not better, than anyone else and his book does a fine job in telling the reader why DD was so tragic. The humiliations, the anger, the stupidity that she had to put up with from Hollywood and America are all spelled out without going into hundreds of pages. The story of DD's ghastly marriages and her retarded daughter were quite moving. This book is respectful of DDs memory and is clearly written by a man who loved her and was able to see the real woman behind the star. Frankly, I enjoyed this far more than I did the huge minutiae laden book by Donald Bogle."
4,A must read for all of us who want more of Dorothy Dandridge,"I want to thank Earl Mills for writing this heartwarming book, Dorothy Dandridge. After watching the HBO special starring Halle Berry, I wanted to read more about the life of Dorothy Dandridge. I was so impressed with her, it moved me in ways inexplicable to others! I recommend this book to all. The book even goes in detail about the making of the HBO Movie. Halle Berry and Brent Spiner (who portrayed the author) comment on their experiences as well. You will not be disappointed."
5,A little girl lost -- one of Hollywoods brightest stars,"I highly recommend this book because it written by someone who cared for Dorothy deeply. He was there during most of the events surrounding her stardom and can give an account of these events. It is much like Marilyn Monroe's tragic life, except Dorothy had so much talent and had to deal with all of the discrimination. I think anyone interested in learning about her life and rise to stardom would enjoy this book."
2,Haphazard,"I thought the book was poorly organized and had factual errors. Okay, I'll give the guy a break because he's not a pro writer. Its haphazard arrangement is confusing, and he seems to have had only one source, the subject. He believed anything she said without checking it out with anyone else. The coda of the paperback edition, which has details about the movie, is written in an extremely annoying, fawning style with lots of out-of-place, phony enthusiasm. I'm surprised the movie turned out so good, being made from this book. The only good part is if you're a fan of one of the movie's stars, as I am, it has quotes from some of them."
4,Excellent Info,"This book offers the much needed assurance that as counselors, we are not alone in our work. Try as we might, we are falible as are all human beings. The recognition that even some of the biggest names in psychotherapy have had ""bad"" sessions, allows for others to feel more comfortable in their own work."
3,We all make mistakes,"A series of short chapters where master therapists share their goofs, this book can offer some relief to ""real life"" therapists. Predictably, a main theme of the book was it's not about the mistakes, but about what you can learn from them.I felt that this book did not match up to the captivating and enthralling content and style of other three similar books by Kottler and Carlson. Perhaps the reason for the dryer nature of this book was (as Kottler and Carlson also pointed out) that it was difficult for the therapists interviewed to speak candidly about their perceived therapeutic failures. As a result, the therapists in these stories seemed to be much more detached and expert-like than in the other books where they seemed human, genuine, and real. But, I suppose this shows that even therapists struggle with self-acceptance when confronting personal issues. (Perhaps that's the real message of this book!) :)"
2,Too much of a good thing,"When I first received this case, I was pretty impressed by it - thick, solid. But that turned out to be a problem.The plastic is so thick, that it prevents you from properly using the click wheel. Whenever I tried to press the Play button, the case forced by finger to end up pressing the center button. I kept having to try to wedge my fingernail down to get the Play button to activate.While this problem alone was enough for me to abandon this case, there are also two other more minor irritants: (1) the opening for the Hold button is so small, it's almost impossible to access it and (2) the case is a bit slippery.I used this for two weeks to make sure my evaluation was appropriate - and then gave up on the case. A few small design changes would have been a vast improvement - like beveling the area around the click wheel. That's what the Speck SeeThru-Lucid case does - and that's the one I've gone with."
4,Almost perfect,"So when I received a red nano for my birthday, I immediately set out to find a case that would protect it. I already had a clear case in mind when I stumbled on this case for a good price. The case itsalmost perfect, protecting my iPod in a case that is suprisingly easy to open and close and easy to use. The touchpad is not phased at all under the thin plastic covering, providing protection without hindering performance. The carabiner is quite handy, but there is always the option to take it off, so it is not permanently attached. Now for the cons: the hold switch is almost impossible to access, speakers and other accessories (not including the standard iPod headphones) do not fit in the jack perfectly and sometimes fall out, and I cannot put my iPod in my dock with the case on, because the case does not allow the port to insert all the way into the bottom of the iPod. Overall, it's worth getting to protect the ipod when not docked, just beware of minor inconvieniences."
2,not so good,"case was ok for protection but couldn't plug in accesories into bottom port while the case was on, like monster radio listening device."
4,"Great, but....","sometimes the back cover comes off, if i'm not careful (b/c I have it on my keychain)."
5,iPod nano clear protective case,This acrylic case is great. I have had my iPod nano for about two months. There is not one scratch on it thanks to this case.
3,Good case only with Apple ear buds!,The case is fine with Apple ear buds. None of the head phones or external speaker jacks that I've tried to use will fit through the hole so you need to remove it from the case to install them. The hole can possibly be drilled larger but I will instead return the case and opt for one that works properly for my situation.
4,On Time,"Product came right on time, have yet to use it because I thought I lost my ipod! Was exactly what I thought it would be. Thanks"
1,"Protects well, but not useful","It fits well and protects well, but I cannot access the ""lock"" sliding tab on the top with the case on. If you don't use the orange sliding lock tab, this case is perfect for your Nano. Otherwise, I ended up discarding it. I travel with the iPod and leave it LOCKED in my computer bag, and my finger cannot slide the LOCK tab once the case is on. Also, it will not fit into an iHome device with the case installed. The earbuds and USB cable fit OK. It will fit in an iHome of you use the MP3 cable attached. The iPod cannot fit deep enough into an iHome to play when this cover is attached."
3,Doesn't fit the IPod nano 2G,The case is OK but it does not fit my IPod nano 2G - the opening for the wheel is in the wrong place. The seller was very responsive and credited my account.
5,Good Case,"Great case for the money, clip is cheap get a new one from Wal mart. Other then that good product."
4,Belkin iPod nano clear case,"This case absolutely fit the bill providing protection for my iPod. I can access the menu wheel and while I chose not to use the carabiner, I can see how folks would find that part very useful for clipping to a backpack or belt loop, etc. My only complaint about this item is that because of how the iPod fits in it, I cannot plug it into any charging device that is mounted, for example the iHome series products. The USB cable that comes with the iPod will definitely work with this case, so if that's how you charge yours, then you will never have a problem with this case; however, if you use any after-market charger, cradle, or anything like that, you'll have to take the iPod out of the case to charge your iPod which is inconvenient."
5,NICE looking and EASY to use clear cover!!!,"I needed a new ipod cover and sadly I had only about 2 types of covers to choose from due to my older ipod. Luckily I found this, and purchased it. When it arrived in a timely manner, it was easy to adjust to my ipod.I love it and the clip that comes with it is VERY handy especially for workouts!!"
4,Good sturdy case !,"I believe I have the 2nd gen ipod nano so I ordered a case. Got the case and it looks sturdy but unfortunately, it seems I ordered the incorrect case. I am hoping to order the correct case this time and expecting the same durability as I have seen with my initial order. I got the case in great condition and the time frame in ordering was not an issue with me considering I used the regular day shipping.Thanks seller."
5,5 STARS!!! PERFECT,"i seen the reviews of this and was skeptical about purchasing this and i did to try it out and it worked great it protects my screen, and protects the controls Perfect case everyone that has a negative review has no clue this is a 5 star product i highly recommend it! looks perfect on my ipod!!!"
4,Good Secure Case,"This case is a basic case that will show off your nano's color. I found my 2nd gen nano to fit snuggly in the case. The click wheel is covered but still responds nicely. The areas of the dock connector, earphone jack, and hold button are exposed (which I think is a positive since you don't have to take your nano out of the case to use the dock connector). I have not found the earphone jack to come loose. Most earphone plugs should plug in as the hole for the earplug is large enough for most earphones. The only negative is the clip. To use it, you have to use a small plastic tab with a loop that has a metal ring on it (which the clip attaches to). If you don't want the clip and want a flush top, you have to take off the clip, take off the metal ring, open the case, remove the plastic tab/ring, replace it with a small plastic tab without a loop (that can be easily lost), and then replace your nano in the case. Other than this small annoyance, Belkin made an excellent case."
4,nice product,"The clear case is absolutely wonderful in the sense that it covers the click wheel of my nano. I would give this product 5 stars but, there is one thing that you should consider. The ipod kind of rattles in the case and the case isn't exactly a perfect fit."
2,PIECE OF S**t !,THE BELT CLIP IS LOSE AFTER HAVING IT FOR 1 MONTH CAN NOT ATTACH TO PANTS HAVE TO HOLD IT IN MY HANDS.
3,interesting song mix,"Not a great soundtrack, but a very pleasing one overall. I'd give it a 3.5 if given the option. The Dwight Yoakam tracks on here are of course wonderful; nothing rare or ones that you haven't heard before, but a good fit in the context of this soundtrack. The rest of the mix is a mixture of styles ranging from Ralph Stanley doing good old bluegrass, to rockier stuff by Tommy Conwell and the Young Rumblers, and the Meatpuppets and their distinctive brand of psyche-folk. The tracks by Lonesome Strangers and Jim Lauderdale are also very good. A very short album, but the songs are all well done."
1,Not good!!!!,"At first I tought it was good, but when I used for the second time, the black surface on the top started coming out, and the raclettes was very difficult to clean and the food got stuck and didn't come out at all. I would not recommend."
1,Not impressed....,"I have used my raclette for a total of 3 times - the first time I used it, there were tiny chunks of 'teflon' missing afterward, now, it's almost half gone. I have not been harsh with it. Last night I used it for the 4th time but flipped it over to the smooth side (never used). This side is also now missing pieces of black teflon so I can no longer use this item. I love raclette cooking, but this is obviously not a good plate for the top of this raclette.I will say, that the heat is good on this raclette, and the little dishes below are still good. However, it is all unusable now."
4,CD,THE CD WAS FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW WHO IS 94 YEARS YOUNG. THIS WAS HER FAVORIT.SINGERIN HER TIME. GAVE HER AN EARLY XMAS GIFT. SHE IS WEARING IT OUT.
2,Could Have Been Better!,"I have been a Dick Haymes fan for a few years now and when I got this CD, I expected these 12 songs would be the original recordings. Instead, I get these trashy 1950s re-recordings and believe me, he sounds pretty worn out and lifeless. Haymes was probably at his best when he was singing with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Probably the ONLY good song on this CD is ""Love Walked In."" And just as a formality, this CD features the original LP or ""Come Rain Or Come Shine"" and he sounds pretty lifeless on that to."
2,This CD Blows,"I have been a Dick Haymes fan for a few years now (since I was 10) and when I got this CD, I expected these 12 songs would be the original recordings. Instead, I get these trashy 1950s re-recordings and believe me, he sounds pretty worn out and lifeless. Haymes was probably at his best when he was singing with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey and throughout most of the 1940s. Probably the ONLY good song on this CD is ""Love Walked In."" And just as a side note, this CD features the original LP of ""Come Rain Or Come Shine."" Does he sound lifeless on this? Yes. Badly.And so I wont be accused of plagiarism, this is the same person who wrote the March 26, 2005 paragraph. I am 15 now. I live in Milford, New Hampshire."
5,Andre Rieu: A Celebration of Music 3 DVD set,"All I can say about Andre Rieu is this. Anytime you receive a new CD or DVD that he puts out for the public, they are in for a glorious and beautiful time of musical perfection. His music is one of the primary things we do in our home to relax and we enjoy his rendition of some of the world's finest and most beautiful music. One of the very best, ever."
1,Not what I expected,"These DVDs don't work even on my Mac notebook, bad quality. One of the DVD worked, with a low resolution. All in all, I always love Andre Rieu music."
5,Beautiful Music,This three DVD set is exactly as described and it contains three beautiful shows. The Homecoming Show is the best of all.
5,Andre Rieu Concerts,Outstanding entertainment in this 3 DVD set. As always Andre and his symphony provide great family viewing everyone can enjoy.
3,Content dragged down the rating,"Tammy Wynette's voice is at its best on this album. However, I felt like she was carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders by having to sing so many songs about problem marriages, domestic inequalities and keeping the kids from knowing too much. Some of it became cliche - for our time especially, but even for its time., the themes were a little sappy. I was disappointed in this album. Granted, there are some really good songs here, but she deserves to sing only the best songs."
5,Tammy Wynette,"The way Country ought to be! She tells it like it is. A remarkable and talented lady! ""Country"" music today comes nowhere close to the quality of Tammy's era."
1,A disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book. But it fails at every turn.The author's arrogance and naivete shines through too clearly, obscuring an otherwise good idea. Perhaps the subject matter could have worked in the hands of a more mature and seasoned author. As it is, this is the work of someone very, very young who lacks the necessary wisdom.Too bad. A disappointment."
4,Good Listening,"I listened as I drove in the car. I thought I had figured out ""who-dun-it"" several times. Because I like mysteries, I enjoy Clark's books. This one is in an interesting setting with some special characters to get acquainted with and a puzzle to the end."
2,Going Downhill,"First, I have to say that Mary Higgins Clark was my favorite author for years. Her early books were excellent. However, her last few books have become more and more disappointing. Her plot lines are just too predictable. The suspense just isn't there anymore, and instead of being engrossed in the mystery, I find I don't really care ""whodunnit."" Nighttime Is My Time is just another example of why M.H.C.'s latest efforts remind me of that sit-com you used to love, but it just went one season too long. Eventually, the writers just run out of fresh ideas. But I will still always have a soft spot for Mary Higgins Clark. She has written many more really great mysteries than disappointing ones."
2,Nighttime May Be My Time...But it's definitely NOT my book!,"I became a MHC fan immediately after reading Where Are The Children? and thoroughly looked forward to each new book she wrote. However, I began to notice that with her last 3 - 4 books, the plots were becoming weak, the dialogue repetitious, and the mysteries, luke warm.With Nighttime is My Time, I began skipping full pages, just to get through the chapter; that's how tedious the writing was. Also, by the time I found out who the 'Owl' was, I really didn't care, because there was no real rhyme or reason supporting the villain.When I get to the point where I'm checking the story to see if there are any 'fancy' vocabulary words that I may not know, I realize the book no longer holds my attention. This was the case of Nighttime is My Time. I think I'll begin waiting for MHC books to come out in paperback!"
2,"Poor writing, formulaic, insults reader's intelligence","This was my first MH Clark book. I read a lot and enjoy most genres, including suspense. There are so many excellent writers today that I can't imagine reading another of hers. I imagine this as the kind of novel an artificial-intelligence computer program could generate when fed a standard formula. Dialogue was stiff, wordy and unnatural; even the teenagers speak careful, precise sentences. The story and characters were highly contrived, implausible and irritating. There's no attempt at thoughtful pacing: page after page spent on dull events while the most climatic events, including the ending, get a few sentences. There's so much better out there, folks; break out of the rut of buying the same hack author over and over and give a new writer, and yourself, a chance."
2,BORING,"Instead of 370 pages, this book could have been written in 200 or less. It just went on and on until I thought I couldn't stand it anymore. Even the sentence structure was odd at times so I found myself re-reading because it just didn't make any sense. I get very resentful when I spend hours reading a book and realize, when I finish, that I have wasted precious time. Don't bother with this one. MHC, retire!"
3,Too long,"This was a pretty good book but not as good as her others. Main character, Jean, was a little stiff, Jake was annoying and Sam a little dense, but all of the suspects made the book interesting. Also, the book was tooooooo long, it should have been no more than 340 pages, too many details that were not necessary."
2,Long-winded Tale,It was disappointed with Mary Higgins Clark latest novel Nightime Is My Time. This was the cast of too many characters and not enough plot. By the time I finished reading it. i didn't care about who the killer was or anything else. Hopefully the next will be better.
2,Not Her Best,"I read this book, and was very disappointed. It definately was not one of her best. Some parts were very well written, but overall it wasn't enjoyable."
2,Not what you expect from MHC,"I think people are giving this book a negative rating, not because it's a bad suspense story, but because it's not a Mary Higgins Clark suspense novel. MHC stories are about the heroine taking an active role in her own destiny. This story was not about Jean triumphing with the help of the hero, the standard fare of an MHC novel, but rather it was more about Jake solving the crime or even more about the villian. I am a Mary Higgins Clark fan and I was let down. I wanted an MHC story and I didn't get it."
4,You better read this if you have a HS renunion coming up!!!!,This was a pretty good storoy. There's a lot of characters in the beginning of this story and right away you can narrow it down to about 1 out of the 5 guys. I wanted it to be a little more suspenseful in that case. It does keep you guessing. I thought it was someone else all along. It was a pretty good story if you like murder mysteries and I liked the idea of the reunion setting!
4,Keeps you guessing,I thought this was a marvelous read. I didnt guess who the murderer was until the very end. I love that!Mary Higgins Clark has shown she is still one of the top mystery writers with this book.
3,Filling Time,"A reunion at Stonecroft Academy should have been a happy and joyous time. But for the honorees it has become a nightmare.One is killed before the reunion.One is abducted and thouhgt to be dead, another is tormented by faxes that have to do with the past. All the male honorees are suspects. A murder twenty years ago enter twines with what is going on . Two new murders take place during the reunion. A student currently from Stonecroft is a great help to the detectives. When the owl is revealed you'll never have guessed who it was.Mary Higgins Clark has to many suspects. Hard to keep tract of them. She does keep you guessing.If you want something to fill your time with pick it up."
2,CONFUSING AND A BIT BORING!!!!!,"Before reviewing this book, I read what others had to say and I concur with many of them. Book was much too long and confusing. Too many characters.I had great difficulty trying to remember who did what to who, etc. Very littlerelevance throughout the book to what happened at the end. Think perhapsMs Clark is trying to write too many books and with the length of this one,one could assume she is selling her books by the pound. Almost felt herniece was writing the book as it was certainly not up to her standards."
2,I miss her old writing style,"Mary Higgins Clark sure doesn't write them like she used to. I remember how suspenseful her first works were and truly miss that. One major problem that I find with this book, and has been the case for the last few, is that she has too many suspects and they are all someone the main character knows. I like the anononymity she once gave her ""bad guys"". I never felt any suspense in this story, but I kept reading so I could find out which of the many suspicious characters was ""the Owl"". The overall feel of this book has been the same in the last 3-4 books she has written. They definitly are not page-turners and don't have me wishing I could sit and read more of the book. I have always been a Mary Higgins Clark fan and I guess I will continue to read her books, although they are not my top choice anymore. I keep hoping the next one will be where she finds her stride again."
2,"Boring, but readable","I started the book a month ago, it is a bit hard to finish. I found it boring and hard to pick up and read.I read a Cry in The Night last month and it was a first for me of M.H.Clark, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. So this book is a bit of a disappointment, I'm halfway through, so I hope the ending gets better."
3,"Not her best, but still my favorite author","Having read all of MHC's books, it is difficult to write a so-so review. Overall the book was good, but not as good as her previous novels. I often got the male reunion characters confused and had to re-read the book jacket to keep them straight. This doesn't change the fact that she is still my favorite author and I will continue to read all her future books."
1,Where was the editor?????,"This book has finally brought Mary Higgins Clark to the lowest point of her career.The author that held us all in suspense with ""Where are the children"" has resorted to the use of superfluous language to fill a book that wouldn't be accepted by Harlequin Romances.As an example. A 29 word sentence to describe flicking on a light switch? That's not including the sentence that proceeded it, that had the character flick on the light switch.This book was a waste of money. Now I intend to stop wasting my time. Four days to read 165 pages. Once I would stay up all night to finish a M H C novel. This one is just too tiresome.Mrs. Larry Crommett"
2,Nighttime is My Time,"This book is a letdown for fans of Mary Higgins Clark. There are too many characters, each is underdeveloped. There are five or six possibilities for 'the Owl'; I had a hard time telling them apart. The main character is dull and hard to care about. Hopefully the author will be back to her normal good form with the next book."
3,Not Her Best Work,"I did not feel that this book was at all close to Mary Higgins Clark's best. There were too many possible candidates for The Owl, and none of them were very well drawn. I also found his motivation to be implausible for the havoc he wreaked and the number of lives he claimed. I must admit to liking some of the peripheral characters, particularly Sam, but I didn't really care for Laura or even Jean all that much. I realize the event in Jean's past was traumatic, but in 20 years she should have been able to come to grips with it better. Perhaps the next book will have characters I can relate to better. I hope so."
5,Nighttime is my time,From the moment I started this book I couldn't put it down! I read it straight through and really liked it. I would definetly reccomend it to others.
3,Not Her Best Work,"I like the book okay, but I was disappointed in the fact that it was a MHC book and I didn't like it more.There were too many red herrings and not enough things to point to the killer. When you find out who it is, you want to think ""DUH! I should've known that!"" This only left you thinking ""Oh, it was him."" It could have ended up being any of them and I wouldn't have been surprised.Still though, it's MHC, so it's definitely worth the read."
4,Finally! A Book with a Plot!,"If you read the reviews I have written on John Grisham's and James Patterson's latest novels, you can understand why I was thrilled to pick up a mystery novel that has a plot! I have started rejecting books by any well-known author. Publishers force them to crank out several books a year. The end result are books that have the texture of cotton candy.""Nighttime is My Time"" is not Clark's best work, but I will take it any day over the trash other authors have been spewing. The book has enough red herrings to keep you guessing. It is a quick, easy read, as well.On the other hand, I would have liked to have seen a few more pages. There are so many characters/suspects that you need more time with each one than she provided. They needed fleshing out.It is a good beach or bubble bath book. Not all books have to be the end all of novels. If you need to relax and mentally get away for awhile, this book will do well."
4,VERY INTERESTING,"I LOVE THIS BOOK, TRUE THAT IT HAVE ALOT OF CHARACTERS BUT UNTIL THE ENDING YOU DONT KNOW WHO IS THE KILLER."
3,Interesting read - not so thrilling end,"It was a good read. Kept me guessing till the end about the killer. There were so many characters and anyone could have been the killer. I felt there were still a few loose ends to be tied. How did the killer really know about Lily? How was he friends with her family? Anyways, I enjoyed the book."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately this was my first MHC book and after hearing how much everyone enjoys her writing I was seriously disappointed. I think that the basic story was a good one and without the red herrings, flowed well, but the constant jumps into the mind of the killer followed by a chapter obviously connecting one of the four men at the reunion to something that was reveal in the previous chapter was extremely frustrating. I felt like I was trying to play a child's guessing game in the middle of reading a story about the effects of childhood suffering and bullying. Less obvious clues given more discreetly and without blatantly trying to connect them to a suspect would make for a much more interesting read and a more enjoyable ending. I also wish that the male characters would have had a bit more diversity rather than being the same recycled character in a new package."
3,Not wonderful but good,"I enjoyed this book although I agree with some of the other reviewers that it was not one of her best. I didn't find the charchters confusing as a lot of people stated although they were all very similiar in that they had unhappy upbringings. I also felt as if I knew who ""The Owl"" was all along. A couple of times I thought perhaps it was another charchter but in the end I was right and it was disappointing. With a better ending though I would have given it 4 stars."
2,Weak effort,This book seems highly contrived and not up to the usual standards that i would expect from one of my favorites.I am glad that i checked it out from the library and did not purchase this book. The way you are continuously supplied with reasons for EVERY man in the book to be the killer makes me feel manipulated. I will not be adding this to my collection!
3,Nightime is a Good Time,"There were some amazing characters in this book, but they weren't the main characters -- Jake, the highschool reporter; Sam, the cop; Alice, the first victim's mother and the old guy at the store. The honorees lacked flavor pretty much, but the plot was pretty good. I enjoyed the book immensely. Had the killer been someone other than who it was, made the difference in a 3-star rating and a 4-star rating. I was a bit let down by a romance that should have developed and didn't. This will make my favorite MHC list, but it won't be at the top."
3,Nothing really special about this book,"I've read a few MHC books and I think I can safely say that this definitely isn't her best - but it's not bad, either.I didn't find the characters confusing, though it did take me several chapters to remember who was who as, like many other reviewers, I found them to be carbon copies of each other. I would have liked to see a little more variety in who they were.The story flowed fairly well. My only complaint (and this is small, but it drove me mad after awhile) was that a lot of narrative sentances were started out by the character's name being said - I don't know if anyone else noticed this.The ending dragged - I found myself skimming several pages near the end.It was an okay read, over all. You keep reading simply because you want to find out who the killer is."
3,Light entertainment.,"The characters are not well-developed and the plot is somewhat predictable, but it was entertaining and took me to the end to see whether my guess as to who was The Owl was correct - it was. But it's a fun, light read."
2,"""WHO"" In The World Wrote This???","I cannot believe this book was written by Mary Higgins Clark. Where is her fabulous writing?? Certainly not in this book. If it wasn't for Jake, the high school reporter I wouldn't have bothered to finish it. There was no depth to any of the characters and alot of white space. Sorry I wasted my money on this hardback."
1,"After finishing this book,","I promptly tossed it into the rubbish. Poor dialogue, unyielding descriptions of usless information and lazy editing make this one of the worst books I have ever read."
1,Not Up to Her Usual High Standard,"I'm a huge Mary Higgins Clark fan, however, this book is not close to her usual high standard. If she hadn't been listed as author, I would have thought her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark had written it. There are many fake clues about the possible killers. They were annoying; rather than keeping me in suspense, I almost didn't finish her book. I hope Clark has not ""jumped the shark""."
1,The real mystery is ... who is the author of this book??,"Mary Higgins Clark is a gifted and talented author. As a long time fan of her writing, one has certain expectations of her work. This book screams ""undeveloped writer"" leading one to question, ""Who is the real author?"" Did Mary Higgins Clark really write this book or has someone ""Snagged"" a free ride on her reputation. Loyalty is a fine quality but to deceive her fans is not. It would appear that the only mystery is ... have her fans been duped?"
3,A Decent Biography,"Saroyan's life is very interesting, and very American, because it went up and down. He had three plays on Broadway at once and then had crumbling relationships. ""The Daring Young Man ..."" and ""The Human Comedy"" are two towering achievements, but some of his other work was not as strong. This biography covers his complete life as well as anything published."
1,A Misleading Title.,"I was expecting something with more of a spiritual theme - like the classic ""Angels in the Outfield"" - so needless to say, I was disappointed."
5,A fabulous campfest,"Travel back in time to the 1970's and find out what made Farrah Fawcett truly famous. Big hair and flares are everywhere in this wonderful show. I have been a Charlie's Angels fan for years and this is the first time I've know of their videos being available. Don't miss 'Angels Under Covers'. Amazon, give us more"
4,Great insights!,"I am halfway through this book and am already amazed at the great stories and information given by the various producers. Who knew that Brian Wilson was such a genius? The advice about preamps from Phil Ramone, the observation about care in locking machines from Elliot Scheiner and the approach Humberto Gatica takes with Celine's vocals are all invaluable. I heartily recommend this book and its sequal."
5,Very interesting book!,"If you're interested in how modern music is made and recorded, this book gives a great deal of insight into the process. With individual interviews, and roundtable discussions, with the top producers in the music world, it provides great information on procedures."
4,Great minds that influenced the world of recording.,This is a great book for hearing the people that have brought you the music that moves you. The timeless stuff. Talk about the creative process but also the business of music. Which is truly the bridge between creativity and commerce. A great read for those thinking about a career in the music business at the creative level. But also for tjhose who just love music and wan to know a little more about the technical creative side.
4,Good point of reference,"It's always interesting to read what others have to say about the art of audio engineering and production. While I had hoped there would be a few more moments of ""oh yeah, I need to try that"", it's really quite reassuring to read that I am using the same tools, techniques, and tricks as these folks - who just incidentally have countless hits among them.What I find most interesting about the folks interviewed for this book is that they do it for the love of the art, not the money or the fame or anything else. It's all about the music. And at the end of the day, perhaps that's the main reason why they've achieved their level of success."
4,"""BIG LEAGUE CHATS""","Definitely this book will guide you through numerous interviews with some of the big names in production, from the producer/arranger to the producer/engineer to the producer/musician. You'll get an idea of how this monsters of the industry work and some of them will reveal some of their techniques. There is no secret formula in this book that will allow you hit success after been read, but it will definitely give you an average idea of how things can be achived.""Behind the glass"" will make you travel from the 60's to the 90's, with artists like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Alanis Morisette, David Bowie and lots more. Some of the technical stuff could be a none-sense for beginners, on the other hand there is a lot of good tips for the home studio musician. This is a book to have on your bookshelves it will make worth your money."
2,Not Bad...,"I would not say that this is the best book to buy for the aspiring project studio owner. While there are some neat stories, etc, the interviews don't give you much other than the ""GO do it your own way, your ears are always right, when we recorded x-famous person, blah, blah, blah, "".. I found the Mix Engineers handbook was more practical. I have read a few of the recording and mixing books available, and while this was a fun read, it was the least practical. If you are looking for production/recording tips get studiobuddy and then buy the recording and mix engineers handbooks."
5,"If you want the true reality of who we are, read this book!","In short, I was raised catholic, and always wondered why the stories in the bible were so twisted. You know that it (the bible) was changed, don't you? Read Genesis again and AGAIN, further more read this book. ""Let US make man in OUR image, and OUR likeness"" hmmm, who were ""US"", sure, sure...the holy trinity, believe what you want, or you can just go burn someone at the stake for being a heathen, lol. Lies, Lies, and Lies! ""God"" is one such lie, not the being, the word! Its ""ELOHIM"" not ""GOD"", B'NAI ELOHIM to be precise. Try this too, read about the ""Nephilim"" in Genesis, and you will be scratchin your head. Ask a Rabbi to translate them for you, then get your copy of ""Divine Encounters"" It will change your life.

2,Difficult,"Mr Sitchin's books provide an alternative world-view that is difficult at times to accept. The 12th Planet and the Lost Realms in my opinion are the best of the lot. This book is a real reach and I had extreme difficulty accepting its premise that angels are emissaries from another physical world. Perhaps if the premise were supported by scientific findings rather than strictly and purely biblical and ancients stories I'd be moved to look more seriously into the thesis. However I think Sitchin could use more work on this book to convince the average reader that angels are aliens from another planet.Sorry Mr Sitchin , I hope the Cosmis Code is more convincing than this and I trust the work is in keeping with the first and fourth books of your Earth Chronicles - a thoroughly delightful and entertaining series of books."
3,Partial Theories...,"Great book with partial theories...only if he would continue to explain everything up to modern times. I don't understand how some people's intelligents were insulted, seems to me the same person who never read any of these books by Zecharia Sitchin keeps putting them down.Anyhow, read this book and any other book from Mr.Sitchin for good theories."
2,%80 truth %20 fiction,"sitchen is a freemason with a money maker. . this book he starts with information from many known sources and then finishes by taking a sharp left into fiction to establish all the other fictions the nibaru anunaki thing is all made up .He is a good author and provides a good read but he leave it to be assumed it is all fact , just not so"
3,Not on a par with Sitchin's earlier works,"Generally an interesting book although not as illuminating as Sitchin's previous works. The entire book is tainted somewhat by Sitchin's conclusions as to the identity of Yahweh. Sitchin clearly allows his own religious beliefs to influence his conclusion in that regard. There is a complete lack of historical evidence to support Sitchin on this issue and despite his statement (p. 374) that his conclusion is ""quite logical on reflection"", it is in fact totally lacking in logic. Those who are truly interested in a thoughtful analysis of Yahweh's identity should direct themselves to Alan Alford's ""Gods of the New Millenium""."
4,Divine Encounters,"Another great book by Zachariah Sitchen,This one has a lot of previous material but I have read all eight books of his Earth chronicles and they are all very mind boggling."
3,Good salty taste,"These have always been my favorite saltines. As the name implies, they have a good, SALTY taste. The amount of salt seems to have been gradually reduced from the levels it used to have many years ago. I would prefer a bit more salt myself - but cannot find a better alternative."
2,"Good price, small packages are perfect but stale","Good price, perfect size small packages, but the first box, 2nd box, 3rd box all were stale. A first for an Amazon food product. It's happened with others selling on Amazon but never a product FROM AMAZON. Bummer"
5,Very happy!,"In updating my 30 yr-old kitchen, this strainer is one of many recently purchased. This strainer was purchased specifically due it's cylinder shape as I wanted it to fit my 4-cup-glass-gravy-separator. It fits that need and then some. Sometimes particles get stuck within the fine mesh, however the fine mesh is why this strainer works so well. Recently, I over cooked the bacon in which I needed to reuse the bacon grease. This strainer gave me usable bacon grease. I recommend it in any size."
5,Perfect Product,"This is the best strainer I have found and the price is right! It is great for those bigger straining jobs between the ""tea strainer"" size and a colander. Highly recommended."
2,"Get the ""cassette pack with phrase book"" instead","This phrasebook doesn't use pinyin or accents. This means no Chinese will understand you no matter how well you follow the book's pronunciation system. Mandarin relies on pronunciation more than anything else. If you enjoy the Berlitz series, then get the cassette+phrasebook pack instead (ISBN 2-8315-6270-8), so you'll hear basic Mandarin spoken. However, I've heard other audiocassettes packs are better."
1,NO TONES,I was looking at this book in a bookstore and it dosen't use tones or pinyin.Don't buy this book.You will not be understood if you don't speak Mandarin with tones.
2,not really for a beginner,"This book is ok, but not really for a beginner, I think that if you really want to learn how to read and write chinese I have seen many other books that are much better on the market, but this book is like a quick refrence book, not really a book to teach yourself anything. I did learn a few words, but very limited to what I can say from reading this book. I have been told I am also not pronouncing the words correctly, I learned the words from the phonetic words next to the chinese words in this book. Like I said great refrence, but not a serious way to teach yourself chinese"
1,There are better phrasebooks,"No matter what level of learning you are at, this is not the book for you. The three major flaws are:1) there are no tones - without tones, they aren't words2) Pinyin is not used - they use their own system which is useless to anyone learning Chinese3) the sentences are too long and complexA good point is that the English-Mandarin glossary includes page numbers. However, there is not a Mandarin-English glossary.I recommend Lonely Planet's Mandarin Phrasebook with Two-Way Dictionary if you want a nice little travel phrasebook."
1,"Leaks propane, difficult to light",The heater works fine once it has been lit. Lighting it with the built-in sparker is very iffy. Most of the time it will NOT light. I had to drill a hole through the cage in order to get a manual sparker in close enough to light it. It always smells of propane. The leak is internal and inaccessible by a user.
4,No Easy Days is right!,"This movie has some incredible footage! It includes cold catapult launches, landing gear failures, failed go arounds, bad landings and deck crashes. It gives you a great appreciation for the safety mindedness, and risk management needed on a carrier deck. The footage of this video is a testament to the progress that safety and design improvements have made over the years.This DVD contains some footage that is grainy or blurry simply because of the age of the film or the quality of the deck camera's of that era. Overall this is a very interesting video that even reviews the accident aboard the Forrestal (the worst Carrier accident in history)."
5,It's over too quickly.,"Rare footage of carrier mishaps spanning 60+ years. Because it's only 44 minutes long, I just wish there was more of it."
5,"Wonderful classic, great for the whole family!","I really enjoyed this DVD. It includes a one hour special episode from the Loretta Young Show called the Road to Lourdes, plus three half hour episodes about a hospital nurse nun called Sister Ann. The Sister Ann episodes were especially my favorite! This is a beautiful dvd you'll want to see over and over again. No profanity, no nudity, no immorality. They don't make them like this anymore unfortunately. Get it while you can!!"
1,Don't order,"I'm sure the dvd is great. But we just ordered our 3rd dvd, and none of them have worked. The first was ordered for a Christmas gift, so it was ordered early and we could not return. The second was returned, and now the third has to be returned.If you want the dvd, I'd strongly suggest ordering from another supplier."
3,"A Triumph, yet a Shame","If you love Loretta, you'll adore this role as it was the apex of her TV show run, I think. It's the closest to a one-woman show that she did. Unfortunately, Mr. Lewis, her son, decided not to have the film restored. This can only be for money reasons which is strange as she must have left them all very comfy. I assume they are Republicans who feel no responsibility to the preservation of the past and that is why. The other video/dvd packages he's offered are similar in quality--bad, grainy deteriorated film in need of restoration shot out of the production cannon. Why Miss Young never oversaw their release in her lifetime is strange unless it was for vanity reasons. I know she sued somebody way back for showing the reruns with her dated walkons intact. I think she may have won and they had to extract them. I still am a fan, but hope someday, somebody who cares will fix these poor films before they disintegrate."
5,EXCELLENT - BUT not a beginners book,"I just finished reading this book and plan to keep it around for reference. Considering it is only 595 pages, which is small for any programming book these days, it covers a lot of ground yet explains it all very well. I would not recommend this book to beginners but I would recommend it to anyone/everyone that has either worked with Access 97 for awhile or read a ""real beginners book"" (Such as ACCESS 97 Macro and VBA Handbook) first. Well done guys! I have read numerous books on Access 97 and VBA and this is by far one of the best."
2,You better be an expert in VB if you want to understand this,"On the back of the book is a diagram showing each book in the Wrox series written to build your 'Visual Basic career'. Each book represents a logical next step as you move from beginner to intermediate to advanced. According to the diagram, this book is supposed to be the very first book a wanna-be programmer should read. You've got to be kidding me. This book is much more complicated than the next level book, Peter Wright's beginning Visual Basic, yet that book is ranked ahead of this one. The programs are well explained, but even these explanations make it difficult to understand what is truly going on because they expect you to have a pretty advanced knowledge of VB in the first place. If you're a good VB programmer, buy this book. If not, get Peter Wright's book first, then go back to this one."
2,This is not a book for beginners - beware!,"Upon completing the first two chapters, you'll find yourself eager to rip through the rest of the book. Upon reaching chapter 3, you'll come to a screaching halt. If you haven't done any programming in the past, prepare yourself for a frustrating experience, tediously plowing through this book."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"It seemed they assumed more than the beginner knows. Their explanations on why the code works did not provide a clear enough explanation for me to understand what is going on and left gaps that I am still stuggling to fill. Also: it would have been nice to better explain how you decide what variables are required and how you decide the syntax of the commands. All in all, the books starts out ok but then leaves the beginner in the dust as it continues. I would recommend the Step by Step book over this one."
4,Excellent intro to Access 97 programming,"If you are familiar with MS Access 97, but are not a VBA programmer, then this may be the book for you.After reading this book you will be able to create full blown applications by using the Visual Basic programming language (VBA) and using MS Access as the database to handle your data.You will not be a guru, but you can move on to more advanced materials when you encounter the need for them.I have used this book as a reference many times, and so have my co-workers.Wrox continues to crank out some of the best training books on the market. Way to go!"
4,Very good for beginners,Although a bit confusing at times I found this book to be very helpful in the VBA language
4,This book was a User to Programmer launchpad,Very good instruction for someone trying to cross the bridge between user and developer. Code examples are challenging. Some sections are project-specific and not contributive to learning programming.
2,Definitely NOT for beginners!,"This book is good, but it's definitely NOT for beginners. I was very disappointed and frustrated. No way would a beginner be able to grasp 10% of what they present. Oh well. The advanced programmers out there will love it."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"These are the WORST stretchers I've ever used!Masterpiece is a good brand, usually, however I think these are knock offs or the defective ones they throw away.they arent cut evenly- and they dont fit into other masterpiece stretchers.I always stretch my paintings, and 80% of the time I used masterpiece stretchers from Hobby Lobby, I bought these because they were cheaper....I guess poor quality comes with lesser price :("
5,Excellent second oven,"Bought this to replace an over range second oven, entire unit had to go.First week did several old favorites including a banana cake, most even cooking cake I have done. Turned down temp 25 to 325 and kept time at 30m. Next time I will reduce time a little as well.Pros: even cooking, glass doors, cool touch glass door, plenty of room, broiler, 110v, timer or infinite control, nice controls, well packaged.Cons: hot top surface, exhaust straight out back, no interior lightBe sure to clean interior carefully before burn in procedure, we found styrofoam behind the metal surface covering the fan.Would recommend, hopefully will not need to buy again.Peter"
3,not really happy,the fan is so strong it makes everything that raises above the pan lean the way the fan is blowing..no control for fan speed...make muffins they all look like they have a nose on them
5,Nice,Very nice strainer that's hard to find in stores. I use mine to clean my jewelry. It's very good quality.
1,Not fine mesh,"I did not try this product. I took one look at it when it arrived and sent it back because it is not a very fine mesh strainer. I was hoping it would be, but the holes are bigger than on a standard single mesh strainer I already have. If you don't need a very fine strainer then it might work for you. I was planning to use it for tea but could see immediately it would not work to catch very small particles, which was the entire reason I bought it."
2,Was ok,I didn't like the strainer for the purpose I intended it for (to strain formula into milk bottles) but otherwise I think it's a strong mesh strainer.
4,great,"The book got to me really fast and it was in really good condition. I didn't realize that it is actually 2 books in one. If I need to take another history class, I already have the book! The pricing was really good, too."
4,Consice and packed with information,Much better than the full version. Well written. Deserves to have a hard cover to reduce wear.
4,Just Ok,"I found certain chapters very well written and in depth, but if you read through the whole book you find that alot of paragraphs and chapters have contradicting information or tones that make it too obvious it was written by many writers. But you should get this book instead of the newer edition because the chapters are almost exactley the same except for new pictures."
3,Did the job,"It did the job it was supposed to, Halloween costume for trick or treating. Buttons were very cheap and would open on their own. I would think for $30 they could have some better buttons or snaps on it. You have to read the reviews to get the right size to fit your child because some of these run really small and some big.I was able to let my kids use them as play suits and got more use out of them after Halloween.If you live in a warmer place when Halloween happens this would do fine, or if they are out of costumes at the store and you don't have time to make one I would say buy this suit. If you have time try to find another costume or make one yourself."
2,Just a bad book,"The beginning of the book is interesting and a good story, but when appear Larry Lucas and he just wanted to die because the life is to hard for him is really pathetic, he wanted to do everything good for his family and the only thing he did was very wrong."
1,Author is a FRAUD!,"Author claims to be a POW, but is not... no military service whatsoever, is a complete and total poser. Do not support this type of behavior.[...]"
5,Works well!,Perfect little ladder. It has come in handy many a times. I highly recommend this ladder especially for a small apartment.
2,Tricam Step Stool,It Works for me around the house but it is not the same as the other stool we already have.
3,Serves the purpose,"We needed the item to reach the top shelves of newly installed cabinets. It certainly meets that need, plus unfolds and refolds easily. It is a little disconcerting that the the metal steps deflect slightly under the weight of the user. They probably deflect no more than 1/8 inch as they deflect from convex to concave when you step upon them. However, the first few times it happens makes you a little uneasy(and, no, I'm not exceeding load recommendations since I weigh 135 lbs.) Otherwise, it fills a need at a competitive price."
5,Love it!,"I've had this product for a few months now and I love it. Changing light bulbs and getting to the top shelf of my cabinets are no problem. Very light, easy to open and fold (no catching your fingers in anything), very sturdy. Totally worth the price."
3,Step stool with handle,This is a great folding ladder as it takes very little storage space. I was hoping the handle was higher as when I am up high and starting to fall I'd like to grab something higher than my knees. I know they used to make them but haven't found another one yet. It is a great little step ladder.
3,tricam two step stool,This stool is ideal for reaching areas out of reach. I am very happy with my purchase
3,WWE will ruin this DVD too,"Yes it sounds like an awesome event live, but WWe will ruin it like they did with the first one. The over editing just kills the whole atmosphere. Like no ECW chants, no references to ECW, no entrance music, the cmommentary was dubbed twice in the first hope its not in this one and you know all the great shooting on WWe will be cut out. Basically everything a ECW fan wants to see wont be there because Vince and his lawyers will be waiting."
4,A sexy read,Sexy and fun. A erotic story about revenge and a woman coming into her own. I like the writing style and recommend this book.
2,boring,"this was a boring read about a manipultive and rather unimaginative heroine...dull, tame sex and nothing much going for it.... pass, I'm afraid"
5,Review of SIGNATURE MURDER,"MS. SHOCK,I enjoyed your book very much and I hope you are considering writing another.Great Mystery.Keep up the good work.Winnifred"
1,Yikes.,Storyline: OKDialogue: err...OKActing: POORDirecting: POOREditing: POORCinematography: POORAudio: OKMusic score: OKI agree with the general ideas of the film. Education is good. Crime is bad. Family is good.
2,"Bashment ""The Fork in the Road",The description was wrong when comparing this movie to Shottas. It was not good.
4,I loved it!,"I do not know why when I read the reviews from this cd, I see so many complaints!! I really liked the songs, and besides, this was one of my favorites CDs 14 years ago. I have been a Tiffany fan since she started her career, and I personally believed that she changed and got mature with this experiment. I definitely reccomend this album."
1,horrible,"I loved Tiffany when I was a preteen. I thought, and still think, she has an incredible voice and sweet, upbeat personality. However, when I heard this album way back in 1991, I couldn't help but laugh. It is horrible!!!! The sound was outdated even back then. She seemed to just try too hard. She whined and growled. Her attempt to promote herself through the song ""Tiff's Back"" was so pathetic. The only good song, in my opinion, is ""Here in my Heart"".I think it is sad that she apparantly thought posing for Playboy and doing disgustiong dance moves would increase her record sales. She and other former pop stars like Debbie Gibson and New Kids on the Block really just needed to update their sound. Trashy lyrics and looks obviously did nothing for their careers. Too bad they didn't just rely on their talent and creativity as well as hire better arrangers and producers."
5,Great Sleeveless Shirts,"These sleeveless ""sport shirts"" are really sleeveless polo shirts and they are wonderful. I first purchased the red one, then I bought the pink, blue, black, and white shirts, I love 'em that much. Great tight fit, the spandex and cotton blend really help that. I also love the 6-button placket and wide, smooth collar, very sexy and feminine. The nice stiching on the armholes plus a noticeable shoulder and side yoke make this shirt one of my favorites. I can't wait to wear it in the warmer weather next year. Even though I am a guy, I love wearing tight sleeveless polo shirts, especially these. I had an unfortunate incident where a woman thought I looked ridiculous and smashed a banana cream pie right in my face, but the stains washed right out of the blue sleeveless polo shirt (like the model) and I continue to wear it with pride."
2,Disastrous Acoustics!,"You'll wish you could have been there when they recorded these sessions.... Not so much because of the potent troupe of swing-era greats that formed Ray Noble's American orchestra (all my favorites: Glen Miller, Will Bradley, Claude Thornhill and Charlie Spivak) or the music they produced, but because YOU COULD HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD IT! It literally sounds as if the session took place in a long, narrow room outfitted with one microphone. The disastrous acoustics frustrate what was probably an all-time great performance. Of all the Big Band CDs I bought, this one had the greatest promise, but it was a promise unfulfilled. Still, the sidemen and the tunes deserve at least a two-star rating. What I wouldn't give for clear recordings of even half the 19 tracks!"
2,THE album for white people to pretend they're black to,"This album is comprised solely of dull, typical Motown hits. What happened to ""Smoke on the Water"" by Deep Purple? I could have sworn Murphy was playing that song while she and Jim were tokin' up on the good stuff during the 'Very Special' Murphy-Goes-to-Chemo episode.This is THE album for white people to pretend they're black to. I think Hillary Clinton put this album on for inspiration before giving that speech to the group in San Francisco where she made that 'plantation' comment on Martin Luther King Day. And during the Q&A; session afterwards, I believe she played Tupac's magnum opus: Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.."
5,fantastic,"The book and CD are fantastic, especially at such a modest price. The CD worked for me without any hassle at all (I have a fairly recent Win98 SE installation, with nothing fancy.) The 60 minutes of mpeg on the CD are worth the price, alone. Reading Glen's mission report was really fascinating -- I've never seen that before. I'd have expected something a lot more formal and stilted, but he's always been a nice straight guy."
1,Leaks all of the liquid...save your money,"I have bought more than one of these hoping I had just gotten a bad one, but they all leak all of the dishwashing liquid. Big mess. What a waste of money. Save yours and don't buy this until they redesign it."
1,6.35 plus whatever 2 containers of dish soap runs.,Leaks all over the place. No matter what direction you store it in. Every ounce of soap you've put in there will be on the counter when you get home.
3,Button fell off,I was coming on here to see if anyone else had the same problem with the button. Mine won't stay on. I guess I'll have to try Super Glue. I was hoping this wand would last me a long time but it fell off the first month I used it.
1,Scotch-Brite Dishwand waste of money,"Yesterday, I made the mistake of buying a Scotch-Brite Dishwand since I could not find replacement heads for my favorite OXO dishwand. I filled it with liquid Joy and TIGHTENED the cap. In 1 hour, the Joy leaked out all over my sink counter even though I was not using the wand at the time.This product should be taken off the market immediately. Not only does the consumer lose the cost of leaking dishwasher liquid, but also money paid for a worthless product.(I noticed other complaints about the button falling off, etc.)"
1,NO !!!,Not much more to add to the other reviews. This wand leaks ALL over the place. It's the button that is the problem. Do NOT waste your money on this.
3,Happy and disapointed!,"I bought this 2-pkg from Amazon last year. The 1st container was Great! A little goes a Long way, too! By the time I tried to use the 2nd container, it was either spoiled, dried up, or past the due date! I have never figured it out! By then, it was too late to send back the product to amazon. So, Use it fast!!!!!!!! Or, share with friends so this won't happen to you! :)"
2,fast lanes bowling,"Game is not what I expected. I am still disappointed with it, but I am getting to use the product to a degree. There is no help files of any kind, so any questions I have with the options menu and others go unanswered."
3,"Fun, kinda.","this game is pretty fun. the physics are awesome, very realistic. the modes are good, golf is really fun. the tournaments are hard unless the cpu has a bad game, since its hard to get above 200 in this game. i think my highest score was 236. avg in this game is 170. its alittle hard since the accuracy and power meters go so fast."
1,Haven't seen it,"I would love to give this product a good review or any review. But I still haven't received it. I originally ordered it in March of this year, it was automatically cancelled because I didn't respond to a back order notice, so I reordered it in May and keep getting notices that it's on back order again. It was supposed to be a birthday gift for my granddaughter in April. NOW, I'm hoping to give it for Christmas. The product may be good but the supplier isn't!"
5,Totally amazing,I was a skeptic at first and did not believe this product would work but my blood pressure has been lowered and now I am a believer.
5,Works well,Item works as described. If you know about herbs you understand Hawthorn is used for and its benefits. I have used hawthorn for many years and this is different and is very good for the heart.
5,Perfect Cheap Flutes!,These champagne flutes are perfect for buying in bulk for New Year's Eve parties. They are sturdy and hold up well. You can't beat the price!
5,Fills a specific need perfectly,"It is almost impossible to find a stand-alone CD player these days (you get stuck with a multiple-disc player or a DVD/CD combo player). The TEAC PHE300mkIII CD Player doesn't have a bunch of silly features that you will never use. It just plays CDs (MP3/CD-R/CD-RW). The unit is a great compact size and has an aluminum housing (not cheap plastic) and a beautiful brushed black aluminum front plate. The unit has the heft of a quality audio component. I have two of them and use them for mixing music. They are super easy to cue up and play instantly when you hit play. I didn't even have to read the instructions. If you are looking for a simple CD player to hook into your system and you don't want to invest months reading the owner's manual, you will love this quality player."
3,"Worked for 1 1/2 months, then stopped working","I was quite happy with this product until one day, I put a CD in and it wouldn't read it. I tried a number of different CDs and the same thing happened. So now I get to try to return it to Amazon and hope for the best. I don't recommend this product."
3,maxsteel 12 shelf review,I'm disappointed in the lack of sturdiness of the rods that compose the shelves. When storing cd's purchasing a couple more shelves would be helpful. dvd's work out fine for number of shelves supplied.
3,Easy to put together,"The DVD/VHS/CD rack is very easy to put together and is durable once set up. My only disappointment in the product is that it is difficult to align the shelves so each one can be used. For example, my bottom shelf is full of VHS tapes, and the next two are full of DVD's. The second to the top shelf is too small to get CD's standing up on so I have to lay them sideways. Then the very top shelf is used for DVD's. Even if the bottom shelf was used for DVD's, it's almost like the package has one two many shelves or needs an extra 3"" for a cd shelf so it's not wasted.Anyways, it works well if you use the shelves exactly as it is pictured (2-3 shelves for DVD's including the top shelf) and two for cd's. Otherwise, if you want one more shelf for DVD's, forget it."
3,need to modify to fit 150 DVD's,works but you need to modify the bottom to make every shelf the same size to fit 4 shelves with DVDs
1,Atlantic maxsteel 3020 tier media rack,Thie unit was a very poor constructed. The floor pads would not stay connected to the post. The post would not stay connected together. The steel post could be bent without any problem. The post should have been made with better steel. )verl all this unit was a waist of money I paid for the. I paided for 4 units. Was a waist of my money.
1,Worth about $10,"Don't expect this to be sturdy; don't expect all the pieces to fit right; don't expect it to actually hold the advertised number of dvds ... with all this in mind, you'll be happy with your purchase, as long as you forget how much you paid.I did get it together, and if you don't bump it, the dvds stay on; but you should have more than minimal skills on making things fit when:1. screws are not tapped properly (no I didn't cross thread the assembly)2. shelf stops tend to shimmy off the insets3. shelf stops are at different levels on each legAnyway, if I'd paid 1/3 as much, I'd have expected the quality I got."
1,"It might be good, but I'll never know","It was just the right size for what I needed, but when it was delivered, one of the corner posts, which are shipped in two pieces per leg, wouldn't assemble because where they screw together there was no interior thread, so it was impossible to get the thing assembled. I'm still miffed that I had to pony up 16 dollars' shipping for a defective product, but at least I got my refund."
4,A sturdy and well finished little shelf,"I have owned a few of these over the years. Finish has not rusted, which is a surprise in this hot wet climate. The shelves are easy to snap together and adjust. A small rubber or plastic mallet is better than your fists of course to tap shelves into place where you place the plastic clips on uprights. Marking black rods with white china marker is not a bad idea too.The bases of shelves have wide round platforms which can be screwed in to the bottom of uprights for adjustments, a necessityto level them.....I am using this product for CDs and DVDs but I think it could hold small books as well.....each shelf has a backstop lip to keep stuff from falling off the back...well designed shelves...Two of the shelves in this order had some wire distortion at ends. One call to company got me quick no hassle replacements by fast carrier. well packed at that. I have to give Atlantic a high mark for this product and a hats off for customer service."
3,"Easy assembly, but only 4 shelves","Very easy to assemble, and it's pretty sturdy even without anchor straps installed. My complaint is that there's a significant design flaw. It is advertised as a DVD rack with 5 shelves, and there are only 4 if you're putting only DVD's on it. The 5th shelf is completely useless, even CD's won't fit. If it really had a 5th shelf, I could have fit all of my DVD's on it. As it is, I now have 20 DVD's still sitting in the floor next to it. Decent rack, just too much money for only 4 shelves."
2,I paid 76 dollars for this?,"Pleasant to the eye, pretty sturdy construction, small, but only uses 4 out of 5 shelves if you want to use it for DVDs! I like the rack, but think it is overpriced! With shipping, it was way too much money for what it is!"
4,Exactly as advertised,"I purchased this to be used in a limited storage environment. I am currently using it to store my XBOX, games and other electronic devices and it works well. The shelves are adjustable and you can move them up or down toa ccomidate the items you are storing. This shelves best feture is also its downfall. Since it is small and light weight it is versitile but this also makes it unstable. Putting sensitive items on the top shelf make them subject to being tipped over and falling. The item does come with wall anchors to prevent the wobble and tipping but in my situation I cannot make holes in the walls. Hope this was helpful."
5,"SNAP TO ASSEMBLE, LOOK GREAT","These units are a snap to assemble, look great, and hold a lot of DVDs and CDs. We had teetering columns of DVDs and CDs stacked in rows on two waist-high wire shelf units about a yard wide by 18 inches deep. Completely inappropriate--looked like h*ll and when we removed a DVD the whole stack threatened to topple. My partner was skeptical that two of these could hold all those DVDs, but they did and two rows of one shelf are still empty. They hug the wall and freed up a couple yards of floor space. Customer service from Atlantic is top-notch as well. One of the female supports arrived with no threads inside, but Atlantic had a replacement to us within days."
4,Well Worth It!,We hung ours on the wall in the theater room to get all of the movies off the floor. We had the perfect out-of-the-way wall for it; and we couldn't be more pleased. It took very little time to install the rack and takes care of the clutter.
4,"Functional, but they shouldn't sell it with 8 shelves","With the way I have it set up 7 shelves just fit:4 shelves for DVDs1 shelf for blu-rays1 shelf for CDsAnd another shelf at the very topIf you only use it for DVDs, you won't be able to use more than 6 shelves.The 7 shelves fit my collections of discs perfectly, but I would have preferred it they didn't include an extra shelf that almost no one will be able use and dropped the price by a few bucks. Thankfully due to the reviews here and my own measurements I already knew that I wouldn't be able to fit all 8 shelves before I bought it.The other issue I have with this rack are the clips that hold the shelves in place. When I opened the box, five of them were completely broken, and when they're on the poles on the rack they don't snap closed all the way, so they don't look as secure as they should. Though so far they've held up."
1,"Unstable, poor quality metalwork and shelves have too big a gap","Bought two of these to hold about 1500 CDs. I had to attach them to the wall with additional brackets besides the cloth strips that come with the rack. The reviews did mention that the shelves were unstable, so I can't say I was surprised, I knew what I was buying wasn't very good, but the quality of construction, in addition to the lack of stability, earns this product a one star rating from me. In several instances, the metal bar welded on each shelf along the back to prevent CDs from sliding through was too long and was bent accordingly. The shelves themselves need another metal bar to keep CDs from slipping down to the lower shelf or not slide in the shelf all the way. In all, I would say this is poor quality, even for Chinese made junk."
2,Not worth the asking price.,"This item should sell for at least half of what they are selling it for.Some of the shelves were bent, the wire parts on some shelves were not attached (Welded at the ends).The adjustable feet were crooked and not even square. I tried to straighten them by hand but they started to make a""Cracking"" noise so I quit.When I got it all assembled I spent over 30 minutes trying to get everything straight and square and it still looks terrible.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was easy to assemble."
3,This is easy to assemble but a little to flexible for my taste.,"Amazon, as usual, shipped my product quickly and I received it on the date promised. I know I would have to assemble this but the set up process wasn't too taxing and I had it ready for use in about 45 minutes.I transfered my movies from a small book rack and after some tweaking with the shelves I quickly filled the rack.It comes with a strap and wall anchor to stabilize the rack but this only keeps the rack from falling away from the wall. The rack, however, has a noticible tendency to sway side-to-side. My rack sits on a laminate floor so I can't tell if the sway would be more pronounced on a carpeted surface.My rack is roughly 50% full. Perhaps once it is full it sway less or more. I don't have any small children wandering around my house but if I did I would be more concerned over the stability of the rack. But then if you have small children you would be better off getting an enclose media rack."
2,Big dissapointment,"It was not really what I was expecting, the paint color, the construction, the bent wires on the back (that are supposed to keep the cd's and dvd's from falling over to the other side...) they all combined to say ""shabby"" instead of ""industrial"". Will change it over very soon."
3,So so,"It works but it could have been made so much better for not much more effort. You put your clamps where you want them set but when you slide the racks down into them the clamps slide down and dont stay in place, thus making the dvds not fit until you slide them back up. Also very hard to keep all four side equal height when the clamps are sliding up and down....kinda hard to explain but once you start puting this thing together youll see what i mean. Aso note that if you do use this for dvds only it only has room for 7 tiers, not eight."
4,"Excellent value, sharp design","Bought this for my son's room, wanting something to both hold his current music and movie collection, and to allow for future growth. This definitely does both. When all 8 shelves are installed, DVDs do not fit on all shelves. To use it for DVDs on all shelves, you'd end up with a leftover shelf. When I assembled the unit exactly as pictured on the front, however, all 8 shelves fit, leaving the lower 2 and top 2 for DVDs. Assembly was simple - exactly like the larger shelves made of this same material. Very happy with this purchase."
4,DVD storage,"This metal DVD rack is well made and reasonably easy to assemble. Once it's together, it's very sturdy. The shelves can be set to handle almost any size of viewing or listening media, and brackets are also included. For extra stability, there are disc feet and fastening straps to anchor it to a wall. The only problem I had with the assembly were the plastic brackets that set the height of the shelves. Even with a rubber maul, it was hard to get the shelves in place. The struggle is worth it- these are an extremely good value and I'd recommend buying more than one because they can be hard to find (I have 6). Plain, simple, and do what they're supposed to do. What more can you ask for?!!"
4,Need better feet...,"Wish the feet are bigger, more like square shape instead of round to givethe rack more stability. Otherwise , a nice looking rack."
2,Piece of junk,Cons: Flimsy. I am amazed at how poorly the legs are attached to this rack. The slightest pressure will cause the leg stands to pop off and they have no threads to secure them back on.Pros: Holds a lot of DVDs
4,Great CD Storage,"My CD collection had outgrown my old, smaller CD tower, so I ordered this one. I had it assembled in 20 minutes, going mostly by the photo on the box and common sense because the enclosed directions weren't very clearly written (as another reviewer said). If you set this tower up on carpeting, you will probably have to use the wall anchors. Probably not so much on a bare floor.Overall, I'm happy with this tower. It's sturdy and attractive."
3,M1 - DP Rider,"If you look at my reviews, you see that I am a huge Dead Prez fan. I totally respect their dedication to the upliftment of black people and to the art of real hip-hop. I enjoy listening to their views on society (even if I don't agree 100%), and have always looked forward to anything they put out. But this one's Ok. It's certainly not the best, but average compared to what I would expect. I wold say I like half the album compared to most songs on all the other albums. Not that this is a bad album, but it's just alright."
3,Decent start,"This is album is pretty good. I think I expected a little more from it though. It has some thought provoking songs as well as some decent beats. I think Stic and m1 need each other on the songs though. They compliment each other and when they try to make songs without each other, there is an element missing. But this effort is 100 percent better than the likes of nelly, ying yang twins and others of there calibur."
1,Puts the Dead back in Dead Prez,"This is typical political hip hop. Rants, slander, and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories. All accompanied by weak beats, bad lyrics, and terrible performances by M(oron)-1. This political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped. Save your money and buy Ghostface's new album. This will be surely headed to my list of the year's worst albums. Big Big Big Big Thumbs down."
4,Works really well despite its small size.,"Bought this for my new Giottos Lava tripod (LOVE it by the way), in an attempt to save some weight. It only weighs about 1 pound and is rock solid. Considering the size, I was rather impressed. I am coming off of a high end Manfrotto with a 2"" ball and while there is definitely a difference in performance (that head cost nearly $200 more than the Giottos after all), the weight difference more than compensated.Unfortunately I will likely get rid of this head, even though I just bought it last week. There are no problems at all but I find the controls to be backwards, by my preference that is. I keep adjusting the tension when I want to release the head. I do not consider this to be a design issue, just a matter of my personal preferences."
4,"Angry, honest, compelling","Chris Eyre's second feature, ""Skins,"" takes a hard, unswerving look at the harsh conditions on the Pine Ridge reservation of South Dakota, not far from Mount Rushmore. Eric Schweig is outstanding as Rudy Yellow Lodge, a world-weary tribal cop who's embarrassed by the antics of his alcoholic brother, Mogie (Graham Greene, who carries the film's pain in his character.)The lighting is sometimes too dark, and the pace is plodding at times, with too many loose ends in the plot. Still, it's a unique view and a real eye-opener for those whose perception of the Lakota culture comes from ""Dances With Wolves."""
3,Skin on Skins,"I saw Skins last night as part of the Bozeman Film Festival. My wife had read the book and really enjoyed it, so I picked up the book and read it also. The movie was pretty true to the book except for a couple key characters missing. Overall I thought the movies was entertaining except for the low budget they spent on the production. You could definitely tell it was an indie film. Another thing that bothered me was when the characters were explaining the Massacre at Wounded Knee to a boy how upset they got. If you did'nt know better, you would of thought it happened yesterday. Most Lakota's I know, including myself, don't walk around with a intense anger for something that happened over a hundred years ago. Although I think we should never forget what happened. The best part of the movie for me was the end. I won't give that away, let's just say is something every Lakota would love to do."
4,Skins,"I liked the movie, but of course I am a Graham Greene fan. Good story, had read the book and movie was close."
2,Another book from Wrox....,"....that has a great title but inadequate content. The book was translated from French, so I'm willing to forgive the writing, but the content just isn't there. I'm starting to see a pattern here: Wrox books have great titles and eye-catching covers, but are pretty worthless inside.The first 3 chapters cover UML, but you have to know alot already to understand what the author is talking about. Still, I picked up some tidbits for my efforts. Chapter 4 reads as though it was pulled from some other book: it has nothing to do with UML at all. Rather, it introduces the author's own replacement for the waterfall model. Chapter 5 (the last chapter) is a case study that doesn't pull together enough of what was glossed over in the first 3 chapters to be valuable.Buy the UML user's guide by Booch, it is much better."
4,"Compact, well-written handbook and reference","This is a well-written book, the writing style is very compact. However, this book is not for first time OO designers. It presupposes a solid grounding in OOAD as well as at least OMT and Booch. For me, it has been a very useful reference book, but not one I would reccomend *learning* UML from"
2,Written in an Instant,"This book has very little meat about UML. It spends most of its pages talking about process. If you want information on the UML notation, look elsewhere.This is one of the two books I've ever returned. Bill Inmon's pathetic book on client/server being the first."
4,pretty good book,"i liked this book a lot as it gives solid examples ..i have read few books on uml before i like this one the best and it is pretty much ""instant"" if you want to grab the past experience of software industry in two days :)"
4,Best book on UML I've seen,"This book has many unique aspects to it. I especially like the descriptions of objects and classes in terms of mathematical sets. The appendixes in the back that map UML to C++, Java, VB, CORBA IDL, and SQL are invaluable. The chapter on software project process is the best treatment of the subject I've seen since Brooks' Mythical Man Month."
4,Best guide from the proper way to use UML,"Of the half-dozen UML books currently available at the local tech book store, Instant UML is clearly the most useful. Muller does the best job of capturing UML concepts without lapsing into diagrams or notation from other methodologies. By comparison to the other books, Instant UML seems to be in the closest agreement with the UML specs available at the Rational site. Best of all, the book is well organized and rigorous. Occasionally Muller is brief to the point of being cryptic, so peeking in Eriksson or Douglass can help. (Instant UML may have suffered in translation to English.) However, when I'm trying to get a grip on the proper way to use a UML notation or diagram, I check Muller first."
3,Finally! A book that is not for dummies!,"Sorry, dummies! I have spent a fortune buying books that are supposed to be ""advanced"" only to find out that the first 13 chapters are for le'idiot. Give the rest of us a chance, ok? I am really tired of shelling out $50 so I can read a few paragraphs of new, meaningful, intelligent information. If you are a newbie, I suggest you read the the Dr. Sues version of the book. (you might fenegle a way to borrow it from your teen-ager)."
1,Author overviews UML in jargonish abstractions,"If you're just now learning object-oriented concepts, then Instant UML will almost certainly befuddle you as the French author tries to cram too many concepts into his abstraction-filled sentences.If you already have a very strong familiarity with OOP, but want to learn UML notation, you might find the UML treatment useful. But why bother? Just get another book that doesn't spend the first half teaching you what you already know: OOP.In my quest to learn UML, I bought five books: 1) Instant UML, 2) UML Distilled, 3) Applying Use Cases, and 4) Building Web Applications with UML and 5) The Rational Unified Process. I've read them all.Instant UML is, by far, the most unrewarding of the group: I spent too much time unraveling his words and not enough time grasping the new-to-me concepts of object-oriented programming.I agree with the reviewer from Warsaw, but can't help but think that even experienced OOPers appreciate clearer sentence structure."
1,Save your money!,"This book went into the garbage can 10 minutes after perusal. The projects are very simple but fit into no decor of any home I have ever been in. The coffee table in particular, looks like something found in the 1950's, without the ""retro"" appeal. In fact IMHO even the pictures of the projects found in this book would have very limited appeal to anyone."
1,Not in my house!,This is rediculous. There is no way someone would put these projects inside of a home! C'mon.... exposed plywood?!? Not in my house!
2,.Disappointing,"There have been some very good documentaries of Bernstein rehearsing but this is not one of them. This was filmed just a few months before he died. He was obviously not well and pushing himself beyond his capabilities at that time. He is rehearing a Schumann symphony with a youth orchestra and obsesses over every little detail. Frankly, its painful to watch. I wonder if the kids really learned anything. He gives a self-serving talk at the start saying he is committed to education but I felt his speech was disingenuous. This film is not even close to representing what he was in the music world."
5,Take Time to Read this One!,"Hurry up and wait! The theme for our world. Everyone seems to be so intensely busy. Never enough time for the real things we want to do.This book will help. It won't be cure-all. But it is great start.God wants His children to have rest, rest for our bodies, souls and minds. Rest from anxiety, etc., so at the heart is our rest in Christ.From this, Kimmel proceeds to apply it to relationships, work, children, suffering, forgiveness, etc.Fun read, but so relevant and applicable."
5,Excellent book!,"This book is a must for families that are doing too much. We pass this on to others as we know too many families that are not living simple lives. This book is a must for all families in this day and age, especially if they have school age children."
5,jme@lamansion.com.mx,"I wish to know more about termal waters in mexico and hotel service inside, localization, rates."
3,"Sort of a biopic -- a month or so in the ""life of"" sort of thing","The program runs less than one hour. The color is good; the images clear; the sound adequate. This appears to be a European TV program giving some background about Christine Schafer. It is more ""feel good"" than informational. It provides some information about her background and formative years. It gives hints at her artistic focus. It provides snippets of her at performance, rehearsal, etc. I came away knowing a bit more about Ms Schafer. The DVD would have been better had it been longer with longer seqments of her performing. If you want to hear and see Ms Schafer in performance this is not the DVD to buy. If you want to learn more about the performer this DVD may help."
5,Great Bottle - Great Price,"This product was just what I was hoping for. Nice big bottle, easy to fill wide neck, and nothing but refreshing water inside (after I fill it!) I have absolutely no complaints. I purchased two bottles and have no scratches or dents on either, no bad taste or smell. These bottles are a great deal!"
3,excellent product,"THis bottle is a great product, now leaching stuff from the palstic easy to clean, the mouth is plenty large enough to fit ice cubes into the bottle. I just thought that the threads would have coarser. It takes a few more turns than I would like, and I'm kind of bummed that they don't offer a neopreme cover for it. Other then that, it's great."
1,WATER SMELLS AND TASTE LIKE METAL,"i don't think the after taste from this bottle can be a heathely thing.after trying many cleaning methods the taste and smell of metal was still present, i through mine in the trash after 2 uses,"
3,"Good, but...","This is a nice product. Unfotunately though the cap came apart the first time I screwed it on. It was easy enough to fix, but didn't exactly inspire confidence. No problems since. I'll order another."
3,"ITS OK , BUT IT HAS ITS DEFECTS","THE STAINLESS STEEL PART IS GOOD.THE STRAP ON THE OTHER HAND HAS SOME PROBLEM WITH THE WORK MEN SHIP. IT TORE OFF IN TWO TO THREE DAYS OF USE. NEED TO MAKE IT BETTER !THE STRAP,WELCROW SECTHION"
2,too much metallic taste,I have the small colored new wave enviro bottle and was expecting the same quality in their 40 oz. It wasnt. My smaller one has no metal taste and this one has way too much in comparison. I can tell the steel is thinner in this bottle as well. Not happy with my purchase. I wonder if it's even food grade stainless.
3,Outside smells like metal,This only deserves a 3-star because the outside smells like metal. Treated the inside with vinegar solution as recommended for metalic taste. Wished there was a way to treat the outside too.
3,Decent Water Bottle,"This water bottle does the job. Nothing fancy. Seems to dent fairly easy when dropped. Don't put the top in the washing machine. If you do, water gets inside the top (as the top is hollow inside). It's hard to get the water out. I'm assuming if you don't get the water out it will build up mold pretty quick. So, other than the water in the top and the dents, this bottle does what it is suppose to do."
1,wasted $20,"I bought this at a local store, and after washing it out a few times (it had a horrible plastic smell inside), I filled it up with water, and twisted the cap on...and the plastic part of the cap broke off. I tried to put it back together, which worked until I screwed the cap back on again and broke once more. This is a cheap product, I'll just stick with klean kanteen instead. my family has owned several kk's for years without any problems."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this item with high expectations. I'm a big guy, and I drink lots of fluids during the day. I bought this in hopes of replacing my habit of drinking big soft drinks with water.For two weeks, this worked well. Then, lo and behold, one of the bottles sprung a leak around the cap. Thinking the cap was the offending part, I purchased a new one. After receiving it, I tried again and the water leaked WORSE!On closer inspection, it seems that the metal opening itself had bent, and the cap was no longer able to seat properly, ensuring a good seal. So, now, unless I plan on keeping the bottle absolutely upright for the entire day, the bottle is worthless.I cannot recommend this for purchase to anyone. As a matter of fact, I'd rather have spent my money on a different brand."
1,stay away! badly designed cap makes bottle useless,"Do yourself a fiscal favor and stay away. After approximately 2 months of regular use (not dropped, mishandled, ect)the cap has completely detached and the bottle is now useless. I never even used the loop on top to hold the bottle. It just came apart during normal usage.The cap has 3 pieces to it: the plastic loop, an o-ring seal, and a steel threaded plug. All three pieces have detached from each other with the threaded plug stuck in the bottle.I bought this specifically to save money, and now I have to drop more money for a replacement. The bottle should be designed right the first time."
5,Definitely the best,Perfect water bottle.Construction and quality is the best compared to others comming on the market now.The 40 oz is also perfect in that the cap portion entering the water bottle is also stainless steel and not plastic.Although some stainless steel water bottles have plastic friendly caps; you don't run the risk of ever stripping the cap by the threads if you use it alot. Something that will last for years to come.
2,Poor Quality Control,"These canteens appear to be Kleen Kanteen QC failures. I bought three - one actually leaked and had to be returned, another had cosmetic defects.Having said that, when they work they're great! I really like the stainless lined cap - it aligns perfectly with the purpose of the bottle - to avoid leachates from plastic."
4,Great Water Bottle!,"This is a really nice water bottle - wide mouth, easy to get ice in it. Many out there that dont have the wide mouth.Wish it would be double walled and insulated, wiith ice in it, it sweats a lot."
3,It is OK,Bottle is OK overall nothing exclusive. one thing that I do not like is CAP is also steel that makes scratchy sound but may be it is to avoide plastic or rubber.Delivery was quick and no issues with it.
3,Too Bad...it tasted like metal....,"I had really high hopes for this bottle, but unfortunately, even after cleaning with vinegar many times using a soft brush, it still tasted metallic when I drank out of it. I love the construction, size, and handleability. I also love the loop top. Maybe some others will have better luck than I did."
4,Nice water bottle,"This water bottle doesn't really have a metallic taste, it holds at least 40 ounces of water, and it keeps the water fairly cool when stored at room temperature. It came with a stainless steel cap, which I wasn't expecting, but I definitely prefer. I haven't had any problems with leaking. The things I don't like so much about this item - the bottle does dent fairly easily (especially if thrown on the floor by an angry 2 year old!). The loop on the cap is small, one of my fingers fits very snugly through it, and when it is full, it is awkward to carry it with only one finger, as it is quite heavy. The bottle does sweat a lot if ice is put in with the water. I have had a couple of days when the water smelled bad, even after washing with baking soda or vinegar, but most days there is no smell. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, and would be likely to buy one again."
1,Steel Water Bottle,"This product I must say was one the first online product purchase in my life where I was not satisfied. I passed up the Klean Kanteen brand and chose the New Wave instead because of price. When the bottle arrived, there was some kind of crusty material on the inside that appeared to be a manufacturing flaw of corrosion (yes, stainless steel can ""rust""). I recieved a replacement in the mail and it had the same problem, so I kept the first one, sanded the interior with 320 grit wet/dry paper and steel wool and sent the second back. The manufacturer e-mailed me and said ""contact the seller"". Never again."
3,Great Bottle...BUT...,"This bottle is light-weight, taste-free, has a good seal, etc., but it DENTS pretty easily. So far, I've gotten about 5 dents, one pretty severe, without ever noticing I even dropped the bottle while in my duffle bag, daypack, etc.I've checked out the Kleen Kanteen, and it's much tougher and apparently has thicker steel walls."
1,Metallic taste and odor!,"I'm surprised that other reviewers find this product acceptable. The bottles left a terrible metallic taste and odor in the water. Even after multiple washings with soap as well as vinegar, the bad taste and odor were there. I even tried putting bottled water in them...just to see if it was my city's tap water that was leaving the metallic taste. It didn't matter. They were unusable and I returned them. Try Klean Kanteens--they are a little more expensive but better quality and, best of all, don't taint the taste of your water!"
1,useless,"Pros: it is a large size, and has large mouth.Cons:The stopper holds fluid, and does not separate to remove it; which will eventually lead to mold growth.The bottle flavors the contents.I purchased this bottle because of the large size, and with hopes of replacing some of my plastic bottles. However, this was rendered useless after one use due to the water retention."
4,Great bottle,"I have two 32 Oz SS bottles from costco and I love them. However when I wanted more they didn't have them any more. So I turned to amazon and found this one slight larger. I find it a bit larger than I wanted, it's just a bit large to hold onto and does not fit in my car's cup holder. But that was not the main reason I got this, it's to carry in my PC bag and last all day."
4,It Works,"This was one of the cheaper bottles in the biggest of sizes. I purchased two. One had a slight leak. I sent it back and it was immediately replaced by one that did not leak. Great customer service. I have experienced slight leakage upon opening the container when the pressure inside is greater than outside (i.e. I let mine rest in my hot car). I guess that just means that the container is air tight. If you want an inexpensive, larger, not-plastic container, this one will do the trick. If you expect to carry this around full of water, it might be a little too big to do so without having it in a backpack."
2,Its a bottle,The lid makes an ear-piercing sound when you screw it on and it is very easy not to have it on tight enough so that it will not leak and yet it looks closed. I wouldn't recommend this.
5,Stainless Bottle,At last my search for a stainless bottle that holds enough water to last through a tennis match is over. Great bottle.
2,Thrid try to post review,This is my third try to post review. First two attempts I tried to give 1 star because it leaked. Somehow those two posts just disappeared. Now let me try post a 2 stars comment see if it will show up.The review: The cap leaked. Item returned.
2,Leaks,"Pros:1. Um.. holds water.2. It is stainless steel, so no more plastic bottles.Cons:1. It leaks from day one, even when fully tightened.2. After a week I was unable fully thighten the cap because the stainless steel stopper is not securely attached to the outer black top cap. It will tighten about halfway then ""freewheel"".Smaller issues.3. The bottle I received has a completely different font, much smaller and style than the one presented on Amazon.4. The graphics and font has almost completely rubbed off.Conclusion:There are probably better choices."
1,Broken lid and bad taste,"The lid doesn't close tightly because there are only two threads. Also, the bottle has a oil or chemical smell that won't go away."
5,Best that I could find,"This is the best bottle that I could anywhere. All metal touching the water with only a small possibility of it touching the silicon seal. Does not get the mold smell very quickly for some reason, which is an obvious plus.I really wish that a company would make bottles larger than 40 ounces. I have to take three of these to work each day, or pack a gallon glass bottle which can get pretty heavy. I know that this is a bit much for most people, but I know that there would be a decent market for 64oz bottles."
2,Pseudo Stainless Steel,"Sadly, I lost my first New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water 40oz Bottle I purchased through Amazon a few years back. This New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water 40oz Bottle, same AISN/ISBN (item number), is vastly different. It's made with some bastardized (brushed steel??) version of the heavy duty stainless steel I had come to love. The plastic cap it cam with was a poor fit and the bottle leaked. I ordered a steel cap to go with it, but there was leaking as well. Perhaps a lemon?? The carrying harness it came with was cool, but I'm not sure I would have used it. Could be handy for the hiker. This replacement fell short of my expectations."
3,it's big,I chose this bottle because I wanted something big enough to not be drained in 30 minutes. If I got a 16 & 20 oz bottle I'd be refilling it all of the time. this bottle certainly solved that problem. My only complaint is that the cap/cork can't be set down without contaminating the part that goes back in the bottle. I've put a lanyard on it so it either hangs around my neck (I hope my shirt's clean;-) or I can hang it somewhere where it won't get contaminated while I'm drinking. The bottle is very simple & straightforward & it holds plenty of water.
4,Throw Out Those Plastic Water Bottles!!!,"This is the third New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water Bottle I've purchased to replace the excessive plastic ones I've accumulated over the years.I really like the 40-ounce size and have come to depend on the durability of stainless. It is easily cleaned with baking soda and although some reviewers have detected a ""metal"" taste, I don't find this to be an issue.Although not a problem with the two previous bottles, the cap on this one did leak. Upon closer inspection, the seal displayed a manufacturing defect. It was easily remedied with a new seal I took from a different cap.If you're looking to dump those plastic bottles, I would recommend looking at this product."
1,prepare for a freak show,"As a middle school social studies teacher, I bought this program because I have been impressed with the quality of previous Globe Trekker films. I was planning on showing this to my class as a way of relating what daily life is like in India. Instead, I was greeted in all 4 geographic regions with a myriad of freak shows. It seems as if the producers were not interested in exploring the real everyday India but instead focused only on the most bizarre. If I didn't know better I would assume that India was a land where rat worship is common, narcotics can be found everywhere, and the men are just waiting to grope the unsuspecting western tourist. If you are into this, then the video is great but if you want a look at reality then this video is not worth the price paid in S&H."
4,An excellent choice for a bilingual approach,"Spanish-English Contrasts is an excellent choice for teaching basic Spanish linguistics with the use of English linguistics as a basis. It is written in English which may make it inappropriate for some upper level Spanish classes/programs. It is easy to read and understand. It is very expansive and covers a lot of information in almost 400 pages. Some of it is less detailed that I would have liked, but it is good for use in a class where you want to cover all the bases in one semester or so. There are a lot of additions to this second edition. Overall, it is useful."
3,my son and husband like it,my husband played it all the way through. it is funny when you have to complete being on the train. if your not fast you get knocked out by the tunnels.
1,WORST VIDEOGAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED,my aunt got me this game and im 14 yrs old. After about 2 months i had nothing to do so i played it. I amazed to see that it was as bad as i thought it would be. You kicked soccer balls at jack in the boxes. If you are buying this game for someone...make sure they are under 6 yrs old
2,Poor sound spoiled it for me,"There is no bass to boost, and the treble indicates why, according to the amusing notes, the string players were called ""the mice"" (a likely allusion to Disney's ""Cinderella."") Please start your Kenton collection anywhere but here."
2,OK But Not Worth The Money,I purchased this preamp about 6 months ago. It is true that it makes your instrument warm and fat. If you are happy with this one feature then buty it. But this pretty much only occurs in low gain position. In high gain there are lots of tube whistling noises etc. So what I am trying to say is this is a rookie design and it should be left to the pros. Not worth the money because it is poorly designed. Inputs and outputs were mislabled and just bad workmanship. Don't let this company BS you. Buy from a proven company with lots of reviews. Sorry for negative review but I just don't want anyone else to get burned.
2,Easily The Outfield's worst,"This cd has only 4 good songs on it and the others are definitely throw aways.You probably heard ""For You"" - the cd's hit song and by far the best on it. Other good songs include ""Unrespectable"" and ""One Night in Heaven"". ""Take it all"" the second single was only so so (don't confuse with ""Winning it all"" off Rock-Eye).The cd is more moody than the other Outfield cd's. It's kind of a depressing cd for them. Look at the Cd cover that tells it all.The Outfield I like is much more upbeat. This cd is the Outfield trying to sound like the psychedelic Beatles (song titled ""John lennon for example). It didn't cut it in my mind.Keep in mind most people writing these reviews are Outfield fans. I like them too but am not a fanatic, but if you expect anything like ""Play Deep"" pass in this one. Try either ""Bangin"" or ""Voice of Babylon"" (recommended). I can't recommend this cd unless you are looking to complete your Outfield collection."
2,Clunky,"I just received my three-step stool by TriCam today. I was disappointed at the narrow steps (12 - inches), the sharp edges, the wobbliness, and the bit of rust showing just above the rubber cap of the legs. Within five minutes of opening the package, my seven year old had gotten scraped on his leg as he came down the steps(I was standing right next to him making sure he didn't fall). The steps are also almost underneath each other. With this ladder, you get what you pay for, and less."
1,The low down and the narrow steps,"Although it has three steps it reaches a lower level than the typical two step ladder I wanted to replace. In addition, stepping on the treads results in bumping your shin bone on the step above -- a brruising experience. Poorly designed."
4,Good enough for this price,Cheaper than the junky one a nearby harware store sells and definitely better than that junky one. It holds my boyfriend and my weight together (270lb) so I guess it's stong enough. I'm satisfied.
2,Definitely NOT the best step stool I've owned!,"When I first started using this, I bruised my shins a lot because the steps are too close to each other!!! Uuuuuuugh! It took a while to get used to. Definitely not as good as my old step stool and is harder to open and close."
4,Very skinny,"The Skinny Mini step stool is indeed very skinny. Very sturdy and the right heighth, a step higher than most step stools. Is a little heavier than most. Well worth the price. The only downfall I find was the size of the individual steps when it was set up. Because of the ""skinny"" the treds of the steps are a little small when it is opened because of the step above it taking up some of the access to the lower step. But overall a very flat, sturdy step stool."
4,One of the first books proposing a sound and complete theory,A good through book on environmental ethics. Taylor has outlined his anthropocentric view of environmental ethics. He has been complete and thorough in discussing quite a few key issues and in answering possible problems with his theory. A good all-encompassing theory that is much needed in environmental philosophy.
4,This Is A Good One!!!!,"I bought this on cassette when it first came out. The original art work was a lot nicer. But, I suppose it's what's inside that really counts. This disk is short, but has some great songs. The title track, Mr. Chow, and Ricochet are the standouts on this CD...but, their isn't a bad track on it. This recording is actually better than most of their later ones. This is a good one!!!"
3,Great idea but SMALL.,"Great concept but the dog must be VERY small, I have kittens and it is about the right size for ONE of them."
3,My cat doesn't really care for it.,"We have a very anxious cat and I've tried just about everything to try to soothe his anxiety, treats, plugins, sprays and now this calming mat. Unfortunately, my cat doesn't really care for it. I'm not sure if it's the smell or what. I think it's a great idea in theory and for ten bucks, it's not like it's too big of a loss if your cat doesn't care for it. Besides, you can always donate it to your local shelter for kittens and such."
2,Very very small!,My kitty is small and it is way too tiny for her to lay on! It might be a good concept but I don't know why it's soooo tiny...
1,Not worth it,"Our cats took one look at this and never even went near it. They like us for warmth, not mats. Also, the heating in the microwave doesn't work. Don't buy it."
4,Works!,"Got this before the holidays.Works great! Keeps the food warm. and looks great to be used on your table unlike some of the other ones which look cheap!Wish I had ordered some of the heat candles since it was hard to find those locally in stores. Was easy to put together. Used it, hand washed and put it back in storage. A good sturdy product."
4,Sweetly romantic,"Steven is a lawyer, and Kate is the interior decorator he hired to decorate their house. Sparks fly immediately, and they clash almost nonstop on the house and everything else. Steven is a man who thought he never wanted to stay at home, but Kate soon changed his mind! I thought this was a very sweet story, where both characters are strongly willed but likeable, and even when they fought, you can sense the love between them. I highly recommend this book."
3,Crawlin,Ever here the song Crawlin? If Coop wrote songs like this all the time he'd be more popular then Justin Timberlake lol. One heck of a tune ! Unfortunatly Coop usually dosn't deliver.Pass unless you have extra money.
1,Generic Heavy Metal,"This is heavy metal at it's worst. Alice Cooper has been associated with some brilliant recordings in the past but this is just terrible. Just look at the song titles if you don't believe me. ""Teenage Frankenstein"" , ""Thrill My Gorilla"", and ""He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask)"" are all songs as rotten as their titles indicate. There is a reason this CD retails so low."
1,Garbage,"I lost all respect for Vince after he split with the original band in the mid-seventies;and that group was originally known collectively as Alice Cooper. Constrictor was one of many attempts to update/revive his career. In this case it's attempt is to be a marketable 80's metal guy. All it accomplishes is making him a ludicrous charicature of his former self, complete with slick studio musicians like bassist Kip Winger, same guy from the glitzy,phony 80's pop metal band.Vince was an integral part of that great early 70's Detroit proto punk/metal scene,along with The Stooges and MC5, and it's a shame he has chosen this route. If he hadn't gone so Hollywood back in 1975, he would still have the same respect that Iggy gets. Here's a tip;order 'Love It To Death','Killer','Billion Dollar Babies', and seek out the out of print gems 'Pretties For You', and 'Easy Action'; then forget it, it's all the Cooper you'll ever need."
2,The Return of Shock Rock,"Legendary shock rocker Alice Cooper returned from a hiatus to make an album attempting to relive his horror induced style hey day. Unfortunately, the album is mediocre with kinda cheesy lyrics and not very scary. The album does have some good points such as the excellent Crawlin but all in all, Cooper has some much better albums to ""shock"" you with."
2,Constrictor,"I haven't had a chance to listen several times to this CD.... However, having heard it twice, I would say that it is far from being in the same class as From The Inside (which I classify as a masterpiece), The eyes Of Alice Cooper or Welcome To My Nightmare... Not the most creative CD from Alice.....Constrictor"
4,Good record,"I bought this to replace an ages old cassette. It is not his very best, but not the very worst either. There are some good songs on it. If you are a true fan, you must have it for the collection."
2,He's Back,"but is it worth it? The album has a few good songs,like Life & Death of Party and He's Back, but songs like Give it Up and Trick Bag really blow. It is definatly listenable but nothing compared to older stuff(Killer,B$B,and WTMN). If your a fan of the old stuff stay away, but if you have an open mind(like me),go for it."
3,It's not that great,"Ok, I love Alice, first, but this album is not that great. In fact, it's downright annoying. There are no truely catchey lines and it is over all rather unpolished. With so many great ALice Cooper albums (Trash, Billion Dollar Babies, Nightmare, Temptation, Hell, School's Out, Stoopid, etc.), why buy this?"
1,There's a reason this album is cheap.,"I worst Alice Cooper album I've heard. It personifies cheezy '80s music. Teenage Frankstein is the only decent track, and even its not that good. Constrictor is the low point of AC's monumental career."
2,I'd pass on this one except for one track,"""Constricter"" is Alice Cooper's comeback album, and thus can be forgiven for a lot of it's flaws. It is filled with mostly forgetable 80s rock songs. ""Crawlin'"" sounds like a poor man's Kiss; ""Thrill my Gorilla"" could have been a Weird Al song. All in all it's lame watered-down Coop.The only song on here that rises above mediocore is ""He's Back"". The song has a wicked synth and menacing vocal delivery, and is the closest this album comes to the old malevolent Alice character's music. The album is worth owning for this song alone, everything else is fluff in the overall body of Alice Cooper's work.1 star for ""He's Back""1 star for everything else on the album.2 stars"
4,From the darkest dungeon,"If you like Alice Cooper and you love the 80's dont ask, just buy this album. The price of this album is incredibly generous, and it's not because it's bad. It's pretty damn good. The album starts off with the sound of a thunderstorm, bring on the Coop. Before he asked the ladies to feed his frankenstien Alice sung about a teenage outcast (cant we all relate) who is so conscience about his puberty struck body that he sees himself as a ""teenage frankenstein"". ""Thrill my Gorilla"" is about mans cavelike behavior when we get in the mood. ""The world needs guts"" is a tough in your face gotta-deal-with-it song. It all comes to an end with ""He's back"" a song about Jason from Fiday the 13th preying on young couples in love. Purchase the album, turn it up and allow your 3rd eye to be filled with modern gothic images that only Alice could provide."
4,A great 80's rock album,"I was surprised when I read the customer reviews of Constrictor and noticed that many has rated it so low because I think it's a very good album. My favourite track is ""He's Back"" but Crawlin' is another good one. In fact Constrictor doesn't contain any bad tracks. The lyrics are cool and well written."
3,Alice's Start To A Comeback,"In 1986, Alice was slowly starting to make a comeback. He needed an album to initiate the comeback and came out with ""Constrictor"". He wrote some great hits on this album such as the anthem ""Teenage Frankenstein"" with loud thunderous drum beats in the beginning with loud heavy metal guitar licks. Also ""Give It Up"" was a good, solid song with decent lyircs and a good chorus. The cool and trashy song, ""Trick Bag"" is a real plus 1! Good guitar solos, solid drum beats and great lyrics The song ""Crawlin"" is a addition to ""Trick Bag"". A little similar in sound. If you like ""Trick Bag"" you'll like ""Crawlin"". A good anthem also is ""The Great American Success Story"". The title basically says what it's about. Enough said. Buy this album to see where Alice's comeback started."
5,So interesting and informative!,I loved this book! It is one of my all time favorite reference books. It has opened up my understanding of the scriptures in a whole new and deeper way.
5,Excellent - jumpstarts a lifetime of spiritual journaling.,"My copy of this book is dog-eared and worn, highlighted in pink and feathered with little yellow stickies. I recommend it as one of the best introductory journal writing books around. The format is unique. On the left hand page there are quotes, poems and insights. On the right hand page is the actual book, which combines literary, spiritual and psychological insights. I've been journaling for almost 10 years now and I still go back to this book for more inspiration."
4,Decent Deal,"I thought that this multi-media stand was a bit pricey; however, it did have a lot to offer...sleek design, not bulky at all, holds everything (cd, video, dvd, whatever), fits in with most contemporary decor. I now have two of them!"
3,Not enough bang for your Buck,"This thing is over-priced for it's size. It was fairly easy to put together, but i put storage units together for a living so that's not saying much. Your better off getting a Sauder. They last longer and hold more for there price."
4,Interesting Stories,This is a book of short stories by an English Barrister. Interesting vignettes of a time when debtors could go to prison and thieves were hung.
1,It's hydrogenated and is best avoided,"In principle I like lard. It's rich in mono-unsaturated fat, and the dangers of saturated fat have been greatly overstated and over-hyped -- it may not in fact be harmful at all. This comes in a neat, tidy package and doesn't need refrigeration, but the problem is that it's been hydrogenated in order to have a nice, firm, even consistency, and hydrogenation can't help but add some trans-fats -- something nobody should be eating at all (barring a few found naturally in fat from ruminant animals, which are very different in structure from those found in hydrogenated fats, and seem to be beneficial to eat).I suspect that the levels of trans-fats here aren't way high -- the hydrogenation is probably just enough to make a firm, consistent product -- but I'd rather avoid them entirely."
1,So boring I feel asleep,"Bad, stilted, wooden acting.A slow, reaching, desperate script.A pointless plot with lots of leaps in logic and flow.Bad bad bad acting.This obviously was one of those straight-to-video mistakes.The plot is quite shallow and simplistic: Find the magic box the bad guys worship and stop their evil world domination. Woo!"
2,"interesting, but forgettable","This movie is about an ancient relic, which Terence Stamp (The Limey, Bliss) wants to destroy but a secret soceity that is secret wants it for there own purposes. Stamp gets killed passing the info onto his son. His son accompanyed by a woman go on the run in search for it, but meanwhile tracking behind are the society lead by a nicely looking Udo Kier (Blade, End Of Days). It is a little bit hard to follow at times and I didnt know what was going on but it was a pretty interesting, but not the greatest. It seems Kier has a knack for playing badguys because he's so darn good at it and Stamp is just totally wasnt. James D'arcy also stars. ""you breathe in and I breathe out"" hmm pretty fascinating scene that was."
4,The Apocalypse and the Birth of Anti-Christ.,"This movie provided me with much food for thought and meditation on the Apocalypse and the coming birth of Antichrist. The idea behind the movie is that Christ's blood traces which are left on the nails used to crucify him have been hidden in a secret box. By unlatching the nails from the box, a secret society hopes to clone Christ to create the devil's child, the Antichrist. Unfortunately, the movie proliferates the feminist myth which arose as a heresy in the Middle Ages and is expounded in the book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ that Jesus Christ had a child by Mary Magdalene. Such counter-church myths are really largely responsible for the breakup of Christendom and the decline of traditional Christianity. The Apocalypse is being heralded in by the Priory of Sion, not by the Catholic Church - Christ's true Church - which has stood fast in its resolute opposition to the growing force of secret societies."
2,Mixed blessings,"Any movie that looks at the end times through the lens of Christianity (even as badly focused as this one) deserves at least a look.It does help to know a little about the Knights Templar/Masonic order to follow the story line, but only a little. The movie has a lot of faults scripturally yes, but the whole...""I can't tell you now...but decode the disk and you will understand"" plot was really the lamest part of the movie.For folks who have their own theories or conjectures about end time events... the conception of a new christ by a Wiccan priestess on top of a Star of David floor mosaic, is probably not one of the more popular ones.The chick did have a nice bum though.There was something about the movie though that did raise some interesting points. The struggle for power using Christ as a tool rings true for nearly 2000 years."
4,Something really different - an intelligent movie!,"Nice to see something different - intelligent, thought provoking and multilayered, stitching together 2000 years of history, myth and magic in the thriller/horror genres. Alchemy, religion, secret societies, astrology, sacred geometry, ancient relics mixed with murder, ritual and mayhem (burning, barbecued and flayed bodies abound)- it's a heady brew and you need to keep your wits about you to take in all the detail, but its worth it - then look through the 1 hour of explanatory extras/documentaries on the DVD to find out just how much you missed and watch it all over again. A great historical/mystical/spiritual puzzle with loads of special effects. Recommended if you want more than the standard Hollywood fare. Also a must for Udo Kier fans."
1,Corrie had the blood of children on her hands,"t is time to stop sanctifying Rachel Corrie. Rachel Corrie came to Israel to help Arab terorists murder Israeli women and children.She died trying to prevent an Israeli bulldozer destroying an Arab weapons depot. Corrie entered a war , as an accomplice to terror and mass murder, and her own records show her as a hate-filled fanatic.Think of the innocent Jewish children targeted by terrorists , with the willing help of Rachel Corrie. Corrie was no more innocent than an SS officer killed during World War II. In fact her aims where the same as the Nazis-to kill innocent Jews!The author also praises the pro-terror International Solidarity Movement , which Corrie belonged to. The ISM openly supports the murder of Jewish women and children in Israel.Also bizarre is to call a hate-filled instigator of terror who aided and abetted mass murder, like Corrie,a 'peace activist'-an Orwellian doublespeak oxymoron if ever there was one."
4,they work okay,"I dropped one and the handle shattered in the first week. On the same note however, they are cheap and who wants to pay a lot for a rod of steel?"
5,The best Christmas gift I ever got!,"I received this book as a gift from an employee for Christmas this year. It arrived two days before the holiday and I'd finished it by Christmas night. I had a really hard time putting it down. I find myself wondering if the two writers still converse, if they've ever met in real life, and if they plan to do more together. It was like eavesdropping with permission, or having a terrific dinner conversation with two old friends. I loved the book and love the fact that the money from its purchase went to charity."
2,Hard to enjoy the trail if you can't find the trailhead.,"This book has one great failing: the directions to the trailheads don't include distances. Believe it or not, once you're off the main highway, it is perfectly easy to drive right by the tertiary road that leads to the trailhead.An example is found on page 264, which is the hike to Blue Lake: ""Turn right and follow Highway 14 to the Wind River Road. Proceed up the Wind River to Road 65, the Panther Creek turnoff.""If the authors had told us how many miles it was to Road 65, and whether that's a left or a right turn, we might have had a hike that day instead of a very nice day trip by car through the foothills around Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Adams. Never did find Road 65."
3,NOT a comedy!!,"Gibson's perfomance is great, as is the directing. The rest of the cast are okay, but this movie is a drama and very, very depressing. Though there are some amusing moments, it not a comedy."
1,stupid,I cannot believe Mel Gibson was in such a dumb movie. I didn't even finish this movie because it was so absurd.
3,It was alright. Not really worth a second viewing but not horrible.,"Refreshingly original but with a few dry spots and borders on overly preachy, this film is well done but lacks a grip on the audience. Mel Gibson performs amazingly in a role of duel personalities, himself and a beaver puppet. He plays this role so well that the Beaver becomes it's own character and truly seems to take a life of it's own. A well done note on people who have to deal with depression and how some cope differently than others and of course more extreme than others. It's a decent film and was good the first time around but I don't believe I'd have a desire to watch it again. It's definitely a good one to pick up from the library or to redbox."
3,movie,i got the beaver because i like judy foster and jennifer lawrence.the beaver movie was alright.it was a bit boring.
2,Loved it and then hated it,"I was given this movie as a gift and didn't expect to like it because I'm not fond of Mel Gibson (though, I really like Jodie Foster). Much to my surprise, it was different, interesting, funny, and I loved the Beaver. Then Mel and the Beaver went to war and the movie was ruined for me. I ended feeling sad that such a great idea turned so sour."
4,The Beaver.......And Mel Gibson,"This movie was way better than I had anticipated well written, directed ( Jody Foster ) and acted with the plot being a little offbeat at times, I don't care about Mel's off camera problems and he does have issues but give me Mel the actor/director and usually you will be intertained Mel does not disappoint here and Jody Foster shows she can put a film together fine job. 4 stars I will always tell it as I see it.SCOTT M"
2,11 minutes of this film was all I could take.,"This movie started out slow and never gave me one reason to continue watching so after eleven minutes I turned it off. While I know it's not a comedy or action movie, I would have appreciated the respect of the producers to at least give me a nibble of something interesting in the first few minutes."
5,YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ALONE,"The theme of being alone, a common place item in Jodie Foster films, becomes over powering in this production. Walter Black (Mel Gibson) is married to Jodie, has two sons and is the CEO of a toy company. For some reason that is really never explained, he is extremely depressed and can't shake it no matter what he does. At a critical moment with his neck tied to a shower curtain rod (guess how that works out) Walter is able to come out of his depression with the aid of a beaver puppet, he uses to project himself with a British accent.At first it is cute and the family takes him back, but then it becomes old and creepy. Meanwhile Walter's son (Anton Yelchin) has his own issues. He is helping Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) write her valedictorian speech (she is also blond and a cheerleader) as she has issues too. This all-star cast turns the film into an insightful and original comedy-drama.F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity."
3,diaipointed in the movie,"the plot of this movie was very silly and even though it had good acting, I really could not get into the movie."
4,Good study of depression and related conflicts,"Gibson and Foster do an excellent job of portraying a couple who deal with the husband's severe depression, which eventually becomes delusional and even psychotic after he starts using a beaver hand puppet to communicate with family and colleagues. In the meantime, his younger son wants his dad around and his older son is dealing with problems of his own with no help from his preoccupied parents.An original and unpredictable story of mental illness, love, and family. No, it's not gooey!"
4,Points For Effort,"The story really tried to suggest a way for a broken family to begin healing, even if it didn't quite go all the way. The puppet is a device for the dad to reinvent himself and become something the family always needed but couldn't get. The supporting characters were not given quite enough to do other than react. The message, however, is good. Change and a shifting of priorities is always possible."
4,surprising and thought provoking,"Jodie Foster went out on a limb with this film, both with the subject matter and who she chose as her main actor. The results can be a little uneven in spots but two things are clear: first, Mel Gibson gives a magnificent performance. In case we had never noticed it before in his shallow action films and even more shallow romantic comedies, this man is an actor, seriously; second, especially with the end of the film it goes to a very provocative, completely refreshing and more than a little politically incorrect place in asking the big questions about life. The ending makes up for a lot of the unevenness in the middle. Good work."
3,An Okay Movie,"this movie was okay. it was kinda boring but the acting was great, even though the acting was awesome that dose not make a good story. Mel Gibson did an excellent job. and jodie foster was excellent to. it was directed very well. but the story was boring. i like drama but this was slow. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you don't see it"
1,Dont Bother Unless You are high and need somthing to kill time,"Dullest movie I have seen to date. If you need something to run in the background but not watch, it would be ok, but as a movie, it is a joke."
2,Perches not the right size,"Got my perches today, and I was very disappointed in that they are actually 20 3/4"" in length, not 20 1/2"" as they were sold on the website. Do you people know how to MEASURE?????I am keeping them simply because I needed them - but they do bend out the cage bars.Last word, if a product is sold as 20 1/2 "" long, that is what they should be - I won't order from them again."
2,Oh Sheila!,If you remember the song Oh Sheila you will remember this group. They were nearly a one hit wonder despite having some other class and soulful jams.
2,Can You Ride PRINCE anymore?,Can You Ride PRINCE ANYMORE? these songs SOund Like Prince Outtakes and for the most par forgettable.Long Time Coming was my cut back in 86 but it hasn't aged well.Love You Down helped Influence Keith Sweat's style.but they were All On Prince on this Disc.this is More of a Prince Tribute Album than a Ready For The World Album?
4,RFTW were tight,These cats were taught on their instruments ! Too bad no one tries to learn guitar playing anymore ! The playing was on point and Melvin was singing in his whiney style that only he could pull off ! I miss bands like these !
5,Long Time Coming,"I absolutely love RFTW and I always will. This CD is one of my all time favorites. The songs on this cd takes me back to highschool days. The lyrics are phenom and so is the group. There hasn't been a band like them ever. I wish they decide again to grace the world with their presence. Great musicians, vocalist, great band, and without a doubt great music! RFTW will always rock because their music is timeless."
1,1.5 stars..... bomb squad couldnt save it.....,"son of bazerk was one of several albums that rode on the heels of public enemy's enormous popularity (see last asiatic disciples and those awful terminator x albums), and had great promise with the bomb squad on production... son of bazerk even mimics the style of public enemy, with bazerk trying to sound like chuck d, and his sidekick trying to play a supportive flavor flav role... unfortunately, neither one has the rhyming ability or flow to keep up with the respective members of p.e.i picked it up after hearing the single ""change the style"", and i was pretty disappointed overall... change the style is a decent single that mixes several types of music in an interesting way, but overall this album just didnt cut it...."
2,Rate it D,Extremely wordy and boring. Several others were much more enjoyable. Hopefully others won't contain so much unnecessary verbiage and a little more plot.
4,the vicious vet,"I got hooked on Agatha Raisen on her first book about her quiche!This is the second one! I love Agatha, she is so human! Her stories are so capturing that I can't wait to see what happens next!To tell the the truth I am addicted to Agatha!I have read all in the series, and have pre-ordered the newest through Amazon!Indeed, I am addicted to Agatha Raisen!jean"
3,A good story developing the series.,"This book is the second in the series. It's a lot of fun and a good, fairly solid story. Agatha continues to be an unlikable, totally ego-centered character, and yet there's something human about her that makes me laugh. She would never be my best friend, but she's fun to watch. If she were a real person, I'd avoid her. Who could blame James for avoiding her, too? But I love the little village of Carsely and the thatched roof cottages. It's becoming a nice place to visit."
1,"A shriveled ""Raisin""","Like Miss Marple? Hercule? Even, Sherlock Holmes? Then--don't waste your time on Agatha Raisin. I checked out this ""adventure"" and one other on tape, and will return them both after enduring only this one. Agatha tackles the murder only because doing so aids her singleminded pursuit of her eligible neighbor--with lusting glances at any other male over 8 and under 80 with a pulse. In the process she rightly alienates anyone in the Cotswolds with any taste, manners, morals or good sense. She is an insult to the detective tradition. Better to re-read ""Father Brown."""
3,Not quite up to par with the rest of agatha raisin mysteries,"Not quite up to par with rest of agatha raisin mysteries, however still provides reader-addicts a good fix."
1,Disappointing introduction to sleuthing series,"Just finished reading this, my first Agatha Raisin mystery. It was proceeded by reading my first Caroline Graham, creator of DCI Barnaby. What a dichotomy of writing styles--the first simplistic and lazy (Agatha ""snapped"" or ""snarled"" throughout the text), the second rich in pyschological insight of its multi-shaded characters.The quick read left me with the disquieting thought that I could have written the novel myself, never a satisfactory conclusion to turning the final page."
3,Agatha investigates again,"This is the second book in the series about Agatha Raisin, who has worked all her life in Public Relations, and retired early to live in a picturesque country village. In this episode, an attractive local vet, very popular with the ladies, dies suddenly, apparently of an accident. Agatha is convinced that it's murder. She manages to get her neighbour, James Lacey (on whom she has a crush)interested, and together they investigate. It turns out that some of the ladies the vet charmed had a grudge against him, and one of them dies suddenly in suspicious circumstances, giving strength to Agatha's murder theory.This is quite an amusing series. Agatha is an entertaining chracter, though I would prefer it if she was a bit more independent. I find her frantic, blatant pursuit of James Lacey a bit pathetic, I would prefer it if she was more independent. I can't imagine Miss Marple pursuing her neighbour so desperately."
3,A Repeat of the First,"Well, I have to say that while I enjoyed this book to an extent, I was really quite disappointed. After reading the first in the series, ""AR and the Quiche of Death,"" I thought I had found a new series to replace the series that I could no longer find (author passed away or quit writing).There are at least two major plot points in this book that are retreads of the first one: the murder victim is a womanizer (exactly the same as the victim in ""Quiche"") and Agatha threatens to sell her cottage and return to London (also exactly the same).I was also disappointed in the characterization of James Lacey, Agatha's next door neighbor. Sometimes he comes across as intelligent & witty and on the very next page, he is a bumbling fool, making unbelievable mistakes.I will definitely pick up the third in the series, but if it does not return to the form of the first book, it will be the last of the Agatha Raisin books I will read."
5,Agatha Raisin,I just love this crazy woman! She's one of my favorite characters. Always an enjoyable read!
4,Predictable but charming,"This is a charming ""cozy"" mystery, if predictable. The caracters are fun and the best part is the the author's discription of the English village. Good summer reading."
2,should not have been released,"Sorry, this does no justice to a giant like Buddy Rich.Inferior sound quality (putting it mildly), sounds like it were recorded on a portable tape player. Worse off, ITS RECORDED AT A SLOWER SPEED! This is proved by the fact all of the charts are heard in a lower key--I've heard them dozens of times live and hundreds of times recorded.It is criminal to publish recordings that make Buddy Rich sound slower than he actually played.Its a shame because two great charts, WIND MACHINE and JUST IN TIME are included here. Tragic."
1,"Poorly made, broke after two months use","I was excited to order a stainless steel product that claimed to press either large garlic cloves or several ""standard"" size cloves and all for a fairly reasonable price.From the first couple times I used it, it felt ""iffy"" when I'd try to press more than 2 standard cloves at a time. It just didn't feel like a substantial tool. Today, when pressing one normal clove, the handle snapped right off at a solder point. It was very evident then that this is a poorly constructed press not capable of handling the normal stress of pressing one clove.This garlic press is poor quality and not worth the money."
1,Horrbile craftsmanship,Just received this item yesterday and was excited to use it for the first time. I washed it with soap and water after unpackaging it.I placed 2 cloves of garlic and when I squeezed the handles to press the garlic the bottom handle broke.Seems the solder used to attach the handle gave out and snapped. Was highly disappointed that this happened.Do not purchase this garlic press. I will be spending a little more money for a higher quality press this time around.
2,Don't buy it,"This item is poorly designed allowing you to over compress it bending the upper handle.Also after 6 or so uses, the spot welds fall apart so the metal disk that pushes on the garlic needs rewelded. :("
4,Good Large Sized Garlic Press,"I've used many garlic presses over the years and this one has stood the test of time. Pros - this large press does press several cloves of garlic at one time and it truly is dishwasher safe (no rust after years of dishwashing cycles). Cons - I have small hands and find the handles are not as ergonomic or comfortable as some other presses. Overall, this is a good press for large garlic pressing jobs. I have found it's a good value for the cost. I've had mine about 12 years now and it's as good as new. I know a lot of people like the plastic thingy that gets garlic out of the holes, but a quick rinse just after use has been working just fine."
2,Not self-cleaning -- a big time-waster,"If you're going to use a garlic press, it should be self-cleaning. Otherwise, you're going to spend forever cleaning out the garlic residue from the crushing compartment. That's the case with this RSVP press. Even putting it in the dishwasher doesn't solve the problem. I got tired of handcleaning it so much that it was easier to just crush garlic by hand. I eventually threw it out and bought an Oxo self-cleaning press. I'm happy now."
4,I gave it a 4 due to the great photos,"It is otherwise a 3. I agree with a lot of Linden's comments about this book, but it really could have used a strong editor to cut out some of the extraneous info (some of it reads like college guys bragging about how much they drank at last weekend's party) and use that space for more info on the discoveries in China. This would be a great gift for people who have an interest in other cultures and some interest in natural history but who don't like typical science books."
5,Unearthing the Dragon,Unearthing the Dragon by Mark Norell is a delightfully fascinating and compelling read about Norell's experiences with Chinese culture as he travelled about the country studying its vertebrate fossils. There is especially good information and photos of his experiences including China's amazing feathered dinosaurs. This book is highly recommended for dinosaur affecionados both young and old who also would like to visit China through an admiring visitor's eyes.Long term dino fans will remember Norell as one of the principals who discovered oviraptors sitting on their nests of eggs.
1,Does not appear to be a Tiffen brand ring,"I bought this step up ring from this seller as it was listed as a Tiffen brand ring. What I received was a generic ring I could have purchased for 1/3 the price. I have several Tiffen rings and they all say ""Tiffen"" on them. This one has a different finish and only has the filter ring sizes printed on it. It appears to work but I have had mixed luck with cheap rings in the past so buy Tiffen rings which are always good. Please be aware that you will probably get a generic ring if you buy from this seller and that you can likely buy the same thing cheaper, elsewhere."
2,Don't be naive,"I agree with another review on here that Thumbelina looks anorexic... I liked the story and the artwork was beautiful. But Thumbelina was a victim in various cases of seemingly dark perverted males seeking after her. She is portrayed as just a beautiful object instead of a person. I was hoping that she would find her way back to her mother in the end or her mother would find her. It would have been nice if Thumbelina could have flown to her mother with her new fairy man or something. Good book, good story just not my taste. I would want my daughter reading more about woman who overcome obstacles and have a will and drive to succeed in situations not landing where ever the wind blows you and being naive and available to abuse. It's good to be respectful but not that passive and naive."
1,Not impressed,"This story was a favorite of mine as a child. My parents gave it to my son (almost 3). Unfortunately, it was not what we were looking for, as there are not enough illustrations for the text. My favorite parts of the story don't even have an illustration! Very disappointed."
3,No Full Workout,"The video is a demonstration of various exercises. If you want a workout that you can follow along -- then you need to constantly hit the pause button, do your reps, then hit play to go to the next exercise. The exercises are very good, but I wanted a workout that I could mindlessly follow along. It is annoying to hit pause and try to figure out how many reps to do. It would have been easy for the producers of this video to give various follow-along workouts. Maybe next time."
4,My poker obsessed friend loved it.,"I don't know much about poker, but my friend does and he has so many poker books, but not this one. It is a cool diary for poker players and he uses his and loves it. It shows him how much money he loses LOL. It makes a great gift."
3,At least a foot wasted in each cartridge!,"I have had issues with this product in the past. It's a manufacturing defect - nothing to do with Amazon. Got a good price, so am not totally dissatisfied, but it is likely that you will lose at least a foot of the laminate/magnet (along with the photos or items you are running through it) because the laminate gets askew at the beginning of the roll which leaves several large crinkles across your photos. I have been making photo magnets for several years and it's just been within this past year that this problem has arisen. Too bad... it's a really great product. Too costly to afford wasting a foot or more with every cartridge. Don't begin your cartridge with precious items!"
4,Great addition.,This is a great addition to the main product. My only wish is that it was longer than 10 feet. There is a lot of waste as well. Tips on how to minimize this would be great.
2,"Big fan, but....","John Totleben is one of my hands down favorite under-rated comic book artists, just awesome, god-like in talent and precision....but this book is not. It's just a dumping of scribbles and old things from pre-Swamp Thing sketchbooks. He more or less admits in the intro that asking him to do the book is kind of a lame idea, his sketchbooks are just working areas, not a sacred mine for unseen nuggets of his work that are comparable to his already-published stuff. Also, the book is really, really short. I'm glad the publisher realizes and is promoting Totleben's importance, but I'd recommend to fans, etc that they go read his published works again and skip this. It would be great for the man if tomorrow could arrive today and save what's left of his vision, I think all comic fans should pray for this; he's really that good IMO...."
1,Oh My God... What a rip off..................,Do not buy this..... I have spent the last 2 hours trying to get it to work....... instuctions are useless... and so are the trouble shooting Ideas.....I choose this over the Melee.... I am sorry I did... I am sending it back right now...
2,save us,"While better than her last 2 books--more rooted in objectivity, perception--here too Graham is so mannered that she cariacatures herself relentlessly; she is, at this stage in her labored career, pure cartoon. One is reminded of Gardner's Faults of the Soul, & cannot help wonder if these poems are the ultimate Frankenstein wrought by the factory poetry system of the MFA: a poetry of preciousness, of hyper-articulated stylistic/typographical *ticks* employed in the hopes of masking a shortfall of intellectual courage & spiritual discovery. If looking to have the top of your head taken off, turn to Hillman or Carson, Brock-Broido or Bidart. The most radical thing Graham could do at this point in her life's arc would be to embrace a decade or so of silence, to not publish every self-reflexive utterance. The other worthy task, one senses,would be to abandon all the stylistic bric-a-brac & hiccuping in favor of language itself, to *dare* to be direct, centered in image, lyric in intent."
5,Limits,"Jorie Graham's poems often situate the reader at a limit--a physical limit, where land and water co-mingle; or a spiritual limit; or a moral limit, where undecidability finally yields. It seems that the great lushness and beauty of ""Never"" springs, strangely enough, from Graham's capacity to enforce on herself a long and difficult engagement with various forms of extinction; it's as if, on the very verge of being silenced ""forever,"" a voice were permitted one chance to sing the song that might make amends--that might restore what is about to be gone. If there were such a song, I think it might sound like the poems in ""Never""--by turns mournful, self-doubting, defiant, exhilarated, propulsive. Graham's work will always require, and reward, the alert participation of readers, but it is also a poetry that, in its exactness and its reach, has always made me feel that I am being guided into a place beyond my *own* limits. I am grateful to her for doing this service for me and other readers."
1,Uh-oh.,"This is unreadable. Go find someting else. Quickly. Notice how the people who review this book are directly polarized - they love it or hate it. If you love Graham's stuff, go for it, you won't be disappointed. But if you're not a Graham fan stay away. If you're looking to read her for the first time, try Swarm, it's cleaner and more accessible."
2,oh dear,"Bless her heart; Graham here relies upon the same tired mannerisms-become-painful-tics to veneer a sheer lack of substance. It's a very dead dog she's kicking. While other writers write dizzying circles around her, Graham does neither herself nor contemporary letters any service in _Never_; one wonders that there is no one around her to suggest discernment (publish less; edit more). Skip _Never_; pray that, as she enters the late stages of her career, she will find a return to the stunning originality of _The End of Beauty_ & _Materialism. Perhaps her legacy will end up being that of a great teacher, rather than writer, outshined by those she taught? If searching for the art form at its heights, read Brenda Hillman, Anne Carson, or a dazzling clutch of younger poets who're doing such service to poetry: Volkman, Shaughnessy, Szporluck."
1,After 911,"After 9/11 this book, this poet, is obsolete. Or ""Never"" mirrors the worst aspects of American culture-- a slovenly, self interested, ridiculously precious sense of being. It is embarrassing to read, frankly. Give me Kinnell, Merwin, Bishop. Poets with heart and compassion, poets who are alive in their poems. ""Never"" is deadening."
3,Can You Please Finish an Idea?,"I have been a fan of Mrs. Graham's poems for only a short time since my daughter brought The Dream of The Unified Field Home with her from a course. No one can say that this poet is not an original! But in this book I feel her concentration veering away from the most interesting aspects of the poems. That's about all I can say about them at this point. I will have to write back. She is certainly a difficult one, but that is no reason to abandon the book. It has real gems this one!"
2,"Not the best, not the worst, just so so. True 4x6 are much better.","First off it took a very long time to receive these, very slow shipping! Then when I finally got them I was disappointed in the actual size of the speakers. In the photos they appear to almost go to the edges but in reality they just don't. I placed these in the front doors of my car and didn't get much sound at all out of them. They are just so so speakers. After a couple days I removed them and replaced them with true 4x6 speakers and I'm getting much more sound now. Not happy with these, but I like really good sounding speakers. Might be OK for someone not wanting much volume and litterally no bass. I would not buy these again."
3,"Sounds clear, no Bass tho.","Has perfect clear sound, tiny, and has little to no bass. But for under 20 dollars it was a perfect replacement."
4,Decent debut cassette,"Belinda is thirty-seven minutes and eight seconds long and was released on June 3, 1986. Belinda reached #13 on the Billboard 200 Album charts and went Gold. The cassette released three singles from it and only two hit the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. If you are looking for the Go-Go sound in this cassette, it is not there. This is truly Belinda Carlisle doing her own music. So some of the songs don't have that pop beat to it. Still this is a great cassette to listen to. Belinda gets a B+.Side OneMad About You#3 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#29 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary#21 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play#19 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles SalesI Need A DisguiseSine You've GoneI Feel the Magic#82 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesI Never Wanted A Rich ManSide TwoBand of Gold#26 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play#38 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles SalesGotta Get To YouFrom the HeartShort In the DarkStuff and Nonsense"
3,Loved it,"After a whole lot of looking around, I finally found this CD and got it last year. The ""new"" songs that I liked were ""Band of Gold"" ""I Need a Disguise"" and ""Stuff and Nonsense"". I gave it three stars because I (at the moment) can't remember the other songs, but I like it a lot more than you think."
5,Conn 120-s Helleberg,"This mouthpiece was great. It was definitely an improvement over the cheap Bachs that my high school made us use. I could tell a difference in my tone immediately, and after using this mouthpiece I could never go back."
3,HoHum Northern Experience,"While I think that most Pilot films are well organized, fun to watch and quite informative, this one is a bit off the mark. Hostess is entertaining not only to viewers but also to a group of guys with whom she hangs and is renamed ""Sangria"". Time to let go of the bullfighting to entice people to Spain. Too much wasted footage. What happened to Bilbao, the hub of the Basque Country? Perhaps this documentary is outdated and precedes the Guggenheim Museum. Funny zigzag across the north and I wonder why they bothered to include Madrid when there is barely a glimpse of this incredible city. Very unenticing and very disappointing. Ruta de Santiago is a bit redeeming for the documentary. Overall the visual appeal is okay but if I were checking out Northern Spain for travel, I'd still be wondering about a logical itinerary what else tourists can do besides drink alot and check out bullfights."
5,Interesting...,"I know nothing about Spain, but this video makes me want to go! Shipa Mehta travels all over Northern Spain, eating tapas and talking with the locals. She visits a monastery and some bigger cities. Some of the artwork in Madrid and Barcelona is shown. A Barcelonan festival is captured. Northern Spain reminds me of France."
5,Far Side Of Crazy,"Great rock song on a great Album. I've got the ultra rare Australian CD (With the pink disc) and the USA CD as well (Blue disc). Both are worth a fortune.'The best song is the single 'Far Side Of Crazy', which hit the top 20 here in Australia back in 1986. The song is still played by FM rock stations, especially Brisbane's Triple M FM104."
4,The Tears of My Soul,"As you read this book you are constantly aware of the ease with which a human can be programmed or brainwashed into thinking, acting and pretending they areworking for a greater cause, even to the point of murder for the betterment of their country and family. I was amazed at the training that goes into programming a spy and at times the amazing omissions that were not used. Read this to better understand the hatred that some countries employ to understand why they are capable of heinous crimes. Pray for the people in North Korea to see the truth."
2,Greatly disappointed,For a number of years I have wondered about Hyun Hee Kim and her path to redemption. I wanted to know about how she got born again. That aspect is only glossed over in the book almost completely sanitized making it of no value for me.
5,Riveting and Enlightening,I've lent this book out to a lot of people. Virtually every one of them said they could hardly put it down. It really lets you know what it's like in north Korea and the extent of the brain washing. One could easily read this over a weekend.
5,Talking to Myself:...,This book is an outstanding book on care giving. It is a must read for all caregivers. It is a very emotional book with funny vignettes. It helps take the edge off some of the more negative feelings caregivers express. It also has a wealth of information for caregivers to get help. It shows you how you can reverse the process of Alzheimer's Disease by treating the patient with lots on tender loving care. A well-written and most enjoyable book to read.
2,Saw the cop before the detector went off.,"It stopped working within two weeks. Turns out, the fuse had blown on the cord. I waited over a year before I put it in my next car. It picked up a cop going the other direction on the freeway between AZ and CA fairly well... but I saw the photo radar van about a block and a half away and had already slowed before the detector picked it up. It was on highway mode in the city, and it never went above one bar while picking up the van. Not the greatest detector out there."
1,returned it toi factory,"I purchased a Cobra radar detector, the 3 times it went off i was aprox 1 block from the cop, the reason i purchased this model was it was said to have a 2 to 3 mile range, NOTSo i called the Cobra manufact. and they told me to return it to them, cost of shipping UPS was $15.00It has not been returned yet, but it was new and in sealed box, but not what i expected. Had I bought it from Radio Shack or Best Buy i could have returned it for another one"
4,Nice,These are pretty and they go well with my bronze shower rod. Nothing super special about them. They seem sturdy.
3,expected better,"I purchased these recently. They came promptly, within a few days which was nice. I thought they were going to be a little better quality than they were. While getting them on she shower curtain rod the paint chipped a good bit revealing a much brighter gold so they don't look as polished as I would have liked. Probably wouldn't purchase more, I'd spend a little more to get a little better."
3,Bend easliy,"These are metal, hard to work with over metal curtain rods and bend a bit to easily making me wonder if they will bend back to normal., If you have to remove these too often, I would suggest plastic or something else that won&#699;t scratch your brushed bronze shower rod. But, they look nice...just okay."
5,shower curtain rings,I have bought this product twice for use in both my updated baths and would buy again. They work well and go well with the bronze curved shower rod.
4,I wish I bought these earlier,"These make my life so much easier. The curtain rings I had before, wouldn't slide easily. They would also open up and fall down after a year of use. These work great, and hold up!"
5,Loved it!,"I really liked the curtain hooks. I wasn't even looking for the curtain hooks when I saw them, glad I found them. They haven't scratched the bronze rod. I went with a all white bathroom with bronze fixtures and plumbing. Looks great!"
4,Unfairly overlooked,"This is one of Coltrane's several unfairly overlooked albums. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this album is that each song evokes a totally different emotion, from the harsh, near-atonal ""India"" to the more playful ""Up 'Gainst the Wall"" to the furious title track to the hymnal ""After the Rain"". I'll confess that ""India"" (which, like the title track, was recorded at the Village Vanguard) isn't much of a song outside of Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet, but other than that, this is a near-flawless set. I find ""After the Rain"" to be moving; Coltrane's literally nonstop (he solos for just about all of its fifteen-minute length), frenetic soloing on the title song, a song based on the Miles Davis classic ""So What"", is breathtaking; and ""Up 'Gainst the Wall"" reveals an unfairly overlooked side of Coltrane: the lighthearted one (also expressed on ""Syeeda's Song Flute"")."
5,"Saffron Robes, A Photo Essay","Recently, I have taken a keen interest to know more about the wayother people in Asia live their lives; particularly the way theypractice their religions. I was able to read this book, Saffron Robes,and it gave me insight into how one becomes a monk, and the journeythat goes with it. Also, it gave me a glimpse of different places Iwould definitely like to see for myself after seeing all thegreat pictures that are inside the book."
4,Great for kids,This is a great book and well written with the right type of font and size to keep interest of reader. Informatin and in terms that children of today can relate to.
4,Sensitivity,Sensitivity is rated 5 stars and is one of the best songs ever made. It is a classic that will not go out of style. The other songs bring the overall rating down to 4 stars.
5,Takes me back every time @}->---,"I love Rizz and I still go back and listen to this on a regular basis. Stone Cold Gentleman, Do What I Gotta Do and Sensitivity are the most amazing cuts. This guy is so smooth and talented - this is my type of r'n b. I think he's as good a solo artist as he was with NE. I can't wait to get his new cd. Go buy this if you don't already have it. It will blow you away."
2,Only A Few Songs Really Hit,"Ralph Tresvant's debut album had the distinct challenge of matching or surpassing the success of Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill and Bell Biv DeVoe's post-NE projects. After years of duty as the group's lead singer, Ralph's time was now to breakthrough.Unfortunately, the album doesn't do much to help. Aside from the classic #1 hit ""Sensitivity"", plus the moderate hits ""Do What I Gotta Do"" and ""Stone Cold Gentleman"", the remaining material just doesn't cut it for Ralph.Ralph Tresvant was supposed to have the biggest solo success from New Edition. His silky vocals on the group's 1988 album ""Heart Break"" was proof of how much potential he had and with this album sort of lost.Safe to say, Ralph was the only NE member to have better success with the group versus without."
1,one hit wonder,this album had two good songs at the most. ralph was good with new edition. it's apparently obvious that he can't stand alone. bobby should have been the lead for new edition. then we may never have seen this terrible album. ralph isn't that good of a singer. this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group doesn't mean you are the best. ralph is miles behind bobby.
3,Could have been better! Average CD,"""Rated R"" - C""Sensitivity"" - A""She's My Love Thang"" - A""Stone Cold Gentleman"" - A""Do What I Gotta Do"" - B""Love Hurts"" - D""Girl I Can't Control It - F""Love Takes Time"" - C""Public Figure"" - C""Last Night"" - C""I Love You"" - C""Alright Now"" - A"
4,Great CD from a talented young artist.,I first heard this CD back in 2000. I haven't heard it since and wanted to purchase it for my CD collection. I'm glad I did.
4,Sometimes good games take a little time to be appreciated...,...and this is one of them. Many times in our instant gratification society people don't want to wait. If you are one of those people then I do not recommend Capitalism 2 but if you are one of those that is willing to put in the effort and explore the depth of the game then Capitalism 2 is recommended. Capitalism 2 is one of those games that many will dismiss after a couple of plays because the depth will not reveal itself immediately. 1503 AD(and others in the series) and Patrician 3 are like that also(both also wonderful games that do not reveal their depth until they are played for a while). Capitalism 2 is one of the better tycoon type games.
5,Amazing,"I loved this game, when i played the demo sometime back but forgot the name of the game, so once i found it i immediatly bought it...The game has a very good stock market, it has training missions(called the entraprenuers campaign) which each most of the things(buttons) to use and is very helpful.Strategies, like when to enter which market and what to research will depend on missions and personal choice.It is a very addictive game and when i sit down to play it it takes me abt 2-3 hours each time, time flies without knowing it...One huge plus about this game is it's low price (10bucks) and it works on Windows Vista as well (so future proof).I am just sad that there is no Capitalism 3..."
4,Adicting Game,"it takes a while to learn, otherwise it's way fun. It's very adicting once you get into it."
1,Dolores Dice?,"I move to america in 2008. This no teach me to be success. Donde esta the teacho for el mexicano? My english es bad, malo. Blacko de Friday had me deal to buy for less monies. I still work in cocina to wash dish. I open box, there is book and small round object to put in ""PC."" Wife read me book (she from LA) a few days after graciasgiving whn church over Sunday. Any help would be thanked. Ma unemploy monies a waste. Please to help. Hope make business for good navidad. Jose"
4,Fun and serious at the time!,"Great game, it develops very smoothly and it shows very well how's the deal in bussiness, in a simple way, but it does. sometimes you may get stuck in it but in overall, is quite easy to play with. Very instructional, interesting, relatively addictive. Highly recomended for people of those who are looking for some kind of a crash course in the bussiness world but in a fun way, without loosing real money. A+"
2,Don't buy,"This is a bad game. It is boring, tedious, and sometimes crashes.If you want a building game you are far better off getting a tychon game because this plays just like it except it has 1/10th the excitement.This game gets a definite SELL rating..."
1,Terrible game,This game was a waste of money. It kept freezing up so I couldn't play for very long. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone!
2,Not in depth at all,"This is not what is it cracked up to be. The first mission is you have to get a $90 Million net profit in a year from opening local grocery stores. That should be enough to let you know this is bogus. Furthermore, you have to achieve said $90 Million by selling 4 items in each store that have a mark up of 50 cents. So if selling 180 million loaves of bread in a year sound fun, then buy this game. Sim City 4 makes way more sense as a business simulator than this piece of junk."
5,A must for a Nanci Griffith fan!,This is by far one of my favorites of Nanci's work. I adore her voice and love the sweetness and feeling as she delivers.
4,Very good,I've used this pot a couple of times since I've bought it for both cheese and chocolate fondues. Overall I'm very pleased. The food is cooked quickly and the clean up time is very fast and easy. The magnet holding the heating cord is genius. When it gets too hot simply remove the cord.I can think of only two negatives. The cord is very short making it difficult to use. I find the best way to use it for company is to heat the fondue and then carry the pot. Also I'm not sure the heating control is calibrated correctly. The warm setting produces violent bubbles in the fondue. I'm afraid to see what 500 degrees will do.
1,Worthless for fondue,Might make a good deep fryer but this thing is no good for fondue. I followed the directions that came with the unit to make fondue. I turned it on and it started boiling. I could not control the heat at all. On the lowest setting it started boiling the ingredients and then burnt the fondue. I would not recommend this to anyone for making fondue..
2,design flaw,The plug unit is held on by a magnet type accessory. the unit it too heave and it does not hold.
1,West Bend Fondu Pot,"This product was awful. The temperature control was so inaccurate that ""warm"" turned out to be""boil"" and the electric connector would not stay attached to the pot."
1,This book is useless,"This phrase book does not have written cantonese. They just use the mandarin. Cantonese is an oral language, so some words are not written(in mandarin). Cantonese people have developed some extra characters aside from mandarin. If you know a little cantonese it makes it frustrating because cantonese will read it and it sounds different from the phonetics they give you to say. Cantonese is a tonal language, but they have no tones in the book. Stay away from this book. The lonely planet book is much better."
4,Sasha Lord does it again!,This is the second book by Sasha Lord that I have read and I have to say one of my favorites now! This book was really good! Get it if you haven't already!
3,It was just OK....,"I typically enjoy Ms. Bryant's books, but I did not enjoy this one as much as I thought I would. There was something missing."
2,Ripped off,"It doesnt have any functions I use on a daily basis. It has OLD NEC code...why? Why would I want to calculate something that isnt allowed any more? I havent used this even for power factor, which is more difficult to calculate than on my $12 Texas Instruments TI30X calculator...cosine angle theta = pF 4 keystrokes on my TI"
3,Not as user friendly as it should be,"This is a niche tool that is rather expensive and could use a lot of improvement. It does do what is needed, but it will lead you to wrong results if you are not careful in how you enter the data. This is especially true for grounding conductor size, power factor and conduit size. Calculated industries is sticking to an out-dated format just to make their product backward compatible and sell upgrades to their older units. It needs a better display, buttons just below the display that change function with notes in the display for the function, multiple input lines in the display. This has all been done by other companies like HP and Ti. If you use it a lot and know its problems, it can be a time saver. If you use it occasionally it can be a lot faster to use a plain calculator or a spreadsheet and look up what you need in the NEC."
4,".....Don't have much mathematic, but is a good product.",The calculator is great for the electrical purposes. It have everything that an electrical contractor may need. However it is not good to do complex mathematical calculations because of the lack of mathemathcal functions. I believe it could be a better product if the manufacturer adds some more math funcions on it.
3,Low on storyline and unresolved story elements,"In it's attempt to imitate real life the Partridge Family was often weak on plot. Also, it's really raw looking (the early 70's and all). I hope we never go back to this way of life again (like we were in the real 70's). Being part of society is better than dropping out of it."
4,it was the most popular TV-Show in our Family,"I' d like to order the whole TV-Serie ""The Patridge Family"" in english. I have any on tape but only translated in german. Is that possible to order?"
3,Nice Book . . .,"This book has many interesting sites and good information. As a ""health nut,"" I purchase many Internet health oriented books. One of my favorites is 300 Incredible Things for Health, Fitness, and Diet on the Internet. Both of these books will assist in becoming an informed consumer."
5,HEY TONIGHT THROW THIS ON,"Always ahead of their time, it would be great if the Lords of the New Church found their time now. The CD combines the raw and the polished Lords. It just gets better with age."
3,Hypochrist!,"As much as I like Stiv Bators and the Dead Boys, I may have to listen to this more than once to really say ""I LOVE THIS ALBUM"". Not to speak ill of the dead (no pun), but to sing about selling out while making music that sounds like you're sellling out is a bit hypocritical. When Stiv gets to show his twisted humor (""Like a Virgin""), the album is good, but when he tries to put on the persona of a glam star, he fails. I'm just saying, if you get this, be prepared to grit your teeth (at least for the first 11 songs--oh his covers are good)."
2,Only for those intensly interested,"I had read "" Into The Wild "" ( a comperable story ) , and followed-up by ordering this book . There wasn't a whole books worth of the Everette story , So I started skiiipping pages just to read the historical information the author had gathered . Maybe 80 % of the book is letters that Everett had written . Which is OK , if you rellish the thoughts of a 20 year old ( I don't ) . His pensiveness & his artistic ability did not & do not interest me . So , bor my intersts , I should have stopped after reading "" Into the Wild "" . that books has a chapter on Everett Ruess , and a chapter of a few other charcters but focusses on a 20 year old that starved to death in the Alaskan wilderness 10 or 15 years ago . i wish it had included a chapter about that cinimatographer who got eaten by the bears he was making a movie of ( also central Alaska ) , but it didn't ."
2,Tree Huggers Unite,"In a word - boring. In two? Boring and dull. Not particularily interesting, not particularily insightful. Blah, blah, blah - it never seems to end. My friend's mother must have been high on crack to recommend this to me. Several hours of my life I'll never get back. I'm a bright guy, PhD, well read, enjoy camping and the outdoors - not as shallow as this review might suggest - but honestly, this book [stink]."
5,"80s beats sound, oh so sweet!","This album is not for the faint of hearted. If you have heard of Oingo Boingo and want to check them out I suggest Best-O-Boingo for a better over view of the band. However, if you are a fan, and you want to hear Danny Elfman's insanely creative style mixed in with an electronic 80's sound, then this is the way to go. Good examples of this are Where do all my friends go and pain, and the original version of we close our eyes is a masterpiece of the synthesiser. Two thumbs up for good family fun!"
2,Boingo's Worst - Still Worth A Listen,"If you are just getting to know Oingo Boingo, don't start with this album. It was a mid 80's attempt at a more commercial sound. Danny and Company had always used strong instrumental and unusual percussive sounds, including a heavy influence from their horns section. Boingo drew heavily from Danny's life experiences travelling in Africa and performing in Avant Garde street theater, this album, betrayed those roots and went for a synth-pop sound and does not represent the fantastic music that Oingo Boingo is known for.There are some things worth listening to on this album, but they would all have been better if they had been performed with less synthesizer, more guitar and horns, and lots of drums.If you are just cutting your teeth on Boingo, but want something that may not be as well known, try ""Good For Your Soul"" It has a great collection of songs that are unknown except to fans. ""Sweat"" for example has to be one of the top 10 Boingo Songs Ever."
5,Tasty Treats for Dogs,My local store had these for a while and my dogs loved them. It was great to find some more using Amazon. I'm not sure if the company is still making these because they seem to be getting harder to find. They're good and crunchy (is there a happier sound on earth?)
1,Three Little Pigs DVD,"This was definitely a disappointment -and, a problem.My three year old son said all he wanted for Christmas was a video of his favorite story -the Three Little Pigs --I went on Amazon and ordered the only one listed.The video is not good for kids to watch --the wolf is constantly calling everyone a ""moron"" ""stupid"" and ""idiot"" words we don't want our kids to use, obviously.We have to find a way to hide this video and look for another one."
5,great aloe vera,My mother in law has GI problems. This Aloe Vera is so soothing and helpful to her. In fact I need to order some more! I order it over and over.
2,REALLY sweet,I found this product to be waaaaay to sweet. I've had two bottles of it for weeks and I'm still not fisnished with it. I find I must mix it with another aloe product to cut the sweetness.
2,Yucky taste!,"I usually use George's Aloe Vera, which tastes and looks like water. I tried Nature's Way, because it said that it was not bitter tasting. But it was just not palatable for me. If I was using it in a protein shake, it would probably have been fine."
4,Probably not in stock,"The book is an excellent purchase, but don't even think of purchasing it here because it probably won't be in stock. At least this is my experience."
1,DANGER BEWARE OF THIS EVIL,Before you trust this man his group and this book do your research. This a cult!!!! Beware of deception.
5,A must for those interested in amateur boat design,"After restoring two sailboats, I think I am ready to design and build one. John Teale's book has been extremely helpful in providing me with the confidence to undertake this task. It is easy to follow and clear to understand. It would have been nice to have some examples on aspects like developable surfaces (in chine designs), or more background on the calculations to better understand where they come from. The book, however, flows through the design process with no difficulty."
3,Not for the beginner,"Teale ""presumes,"" ""assumes,"" and ""estimates"" through much of the basic material, and refers to charts and graphs without a hint of where the data in those charts and graphs came from or how the charts were developed. Perhaps I'm below average in comprehensive skills, but I finished the book thinking the only people that can understand this book didn't need it in the first place. If you're starting from scratch as I am, it may frustruate you."
2,How To design A Boat,This book I am sure is a very educational book although I find it very diffucult to understand. I am a first time boat builder in need of knowledge in design as well as the fundementels of the mathmatics associated with building. Very diffucult to follow
4,If You Wondered How This Explains It,"If you ever considered designing your own boat, this book will have you well on your way. If you follow the design exercises your understanding will be complete. I bought this book to understand design so that I could better comprehend boat plans, which I now can thanks to John Teale."
1,"pretty, but thats all",i found this item very hard to hold and scrub at the same time. had to get rid of it after several uncomfortable holdings.
1,NOT comedy at all,"I downloaded a free video on demand, it claims to be comedy.however, upon viewing it contains vulgar, very NOT comedy content.from the Comedy.com ""make a hot girl laugh"" series, ""lost in translation""I have tried to remove it from my list, but I keep getting the dialog ""Could not delete season. This season could not be deleted at this time. Please try again later.""This dialog has been the result for the past several days at every attempt to remove it.I also notice that the entire ""season"" is now free; this should be properly labeled: WARNING material content suitable for immature adults only. ""Hate mongering comedy hack""the people at Comedy.com that are producing this trash are as guilty as the idiots ""performing"" Mark Ellis is nearly as demented as the hate-monger Julius Sharpe.there is nothing at all funny with the contentnot to mention that these are not comedians, but wanna be hacks.inappropriately using / misusing stereo-types is a ""hate crime"" as far as I know."
1,Not much to look forward to.,"After first 5 minutes, there are not much interesting to watch. Good thing it is free when I got it, but can I return this anyway?"
2,You go to be kidding,Make a hot girl laugh is just another way to look at some not so hot girls.The guys jokes were not funny either.
3,slightly corny,"this video is slightly corny, all though slightly funny. I wouldn't pay to watch it but the hot girl almost makes it worth watching. I give it three stars generously."
