2,Universe gone wrong,"The last review I wrote was after Vector Prime, I'm sure you can see where this is going. I want to know what has happend to this universe that I used to love to escape to? What were they thinking in Star by Star by killing off Anakin? I was under the impression from an earlier book, That Anakin and Tahiri had some pre-determind future together. I thought they had a purpouse? Has everyone forgot about this? Anyway, back to this book. I think it was poorly written with major loss of the characters pesonalities. They have turned this universe up-side-down. Hardly anyone is who they were or acts like they used to be or who they were made up to be. I want to be reading about this universe til I'm old and gray. STOP KILLING OFF ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS!!"
2,Cunningham could have done better!,"I haven't fully finished reading this book (skip part of the Vong sections.) What I have read so far, sucks. I mean parts of the story dont even make sense. I didnt like Anakin's funeral, he definitely deserved more. How does Jaina go ""bad"" and then ""good"" in one book? Luke and Mara are barely mentioned. I really didn't like it, thats my opinion. Go out, get the book and then form your own opinion. But no matter what you have to admit it made no sense and I really expected more."
3,"Nice characters, bad action","This is a fairly good book, but leaves much to be desired. The action is not very well done, but I thought the characters made up slightly. I really liked how this focuses on Jaina, who was underused and kept in the background in other books. I would also like to point out that though the Jaina and Jag thing is always talked about, there's something going on between Jaina and Kyp that is NOT just master/apprentice. In future books this may be untrue, but in this one there is definitely an interest between them."
3,"Good story idea, some disappointments....","The plot was well developed and created a lot of room to really exploit the emotions of the reader, unfortunately those opportunities were more often then not left unexploited. It was a fun story but compared to authors like Stackpole it was a little hard to read. The basic flow of the book was just a bit bumpy sometimes leaving the reader unclear about the authors intended direction/meaning.. It was not a bad book by any means, I enjoyed it, but felt it could have really scored big with Jania and the trickster idea, it just didn't follow through... Joe Roy"
1,Waste of Time,"After looking forward to the next segment of this series, I was extremly disappointed with this book. The writing and story line left much to be desired, the book before this was wonderful, full of action and left you really wanting more. Unfourtnatly I wasted six dollars and the time it took me to read it."
3,Fair but not great,"A competent but not great addition to the NJO sequence. Cunningham toys with several interesting ideas/plot elements--Jaina Solo flirting with the Dark Side; Kyp Durron looking for new purpose and method; some intriguing interpretations and explications of Vong technology and culture; Hapan court politics--but she doens't quite tie it all together into a great story. The plotting is severely episodic (Cunningham makes frequent jump-cuts between sequences without any justifying explications); character motivations are weak; and the development of the central theme--Jaina's moral slippage--is underdone (the sequence involving the Hapan genetic engineer is obviously significant--so why does Cunningham shy away from telling what happens?). Not an embarrassment like Vector Prime, but definitely not a great read like Star by Star or Onslaught."
2,"Dark Journey, a wasted opportunity.","As a long time reader of the Staw Wars epic, I was pleased to see a book offering insight into Jaina Solo, as she has been the least explored of the Solo children. Sadly I feel this episode fell short of that goal and did little to advance the overall NJO storyline. And Most objectionable to me was the continuing decimation of the pivotial charaters of the Skywalker-Solo family. Leaving Jacen's fate in limbo at least leaves some slim hope of his survival. Of Jaina's swing toward the dark side I think it offered few new insights into her true personality. The explaination that grief, or extremity often cause good people to do bad things is getting a bit thin. The writing felt awkward at times, and as I've observed in other SW books whose authors are new to the Star Wars Saga, their grasp of the charaters and storyline seem tenuous at best. This book left me hoping the Next author and book are better.. MUCH better."
2,I'm glad Cunningham only wrote one book.....,"My first two thoughts upon finishing this book were: ""That's it???"" and ""I'm glad this author only wrote one book and not a trilogy, I don't think I could stand 2 more of these."" Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about this book... This book was hyped as a Jaina-goes-to-the-dark-side book, and it is sort of, but all she really does is take Kyp's view and expand it a little. She doesn't turn into Darth Vader or anything. Just goes on the offensive. And by the end of the book she sees what she has done and comes back to Luke's POV. Oh, yeah, the reason I didn't give it a 1 rating is that you get to see more about Jagged Fel and the Chiss. Kind of cool in those parts. Otherwise, not worth the $$$."
1,What a piece of junk! . . .,"She may not look like much kid, but . . . well . . . she REALLY doesn't have it where it counts either. Let me start off by saying that ""Dark Journey"" is easily the worst Star Wars book ever writen. I thought Troy Denning's recent offering was bad, but this book makes ""Star by Star"" look like ""War and Peace."" From the very beginning the reader is thrust into the frustrating, stale actions of Jaina Solo and her band of Jedi rejects trying desperately to escape from a Yuuzhan Vong Worldship that they had absolutely no business being on. This little escape lasts no less than half of the book, until the team finally finds their way to the Hapes Cluster. From there on out, Jaina and her friends perform strange unexplained acts that are only mildly impressive, while Hapan politics take the front seat of this unimaginative plot line. Hey! Shouldn't someone be worrying about the Vong taking over the galaxy! Oh well, maybe they'll just go away or something.[...]"
2,Not the worst ever but bottom 20% for sure,"Other than developing Jaina's character quite nicely (Kyp's too), the book was shallow. The plot developed slooooowwwwwwly, the coolest scenes were brushed over.For example, at the end the story climaxes with a great battle, commanded by Jag Fel himself. Cool. Only we never even learn what happens. No play-by-play, no strategy commentary, no command decisions by the kid,.... NOTHING.No offence, but women authors write boring Star Wars books. Too much emotional crap, not enough story.Bring back Stackpole and Alston, plEASE"
4,"Useful, discrete and practical hanger","This is a great idea someone had! I like the way the product looks, and it handles quite well 4 towels behind the door. The only issue I had, is that the main bar is 1"" wide. So it didn't fit the space between the wall and the door (actually, I installed it to see how bad it was, and I basically couldn't close the door). So I had to buy a curve curtain wall mountain, and installed it a few inches away. Now it works beautifully!"
5,great Dvd amazing what he can do with clay,Mark Alfrey is a legend plane and simple . he has done some great things with clay and worked on a bunch of movies and tv shows . in ths dvd he shows how to sculpt 3 different head while still useing the same piece of clay for each one . it is amazeing how he does it . the dvd comes in Pal and region 1 codeing so both parties around the pond can use it . I hope he does more dvds cause I can't wait to get the rest of them .
4,caddy,convenient store / use for cartons....eventually the scre for the handle pulls through the wall of the carton but fixed it with a wide flat washer
2,Quick Release Mount for Camera Tripod,"I matched up the model # info, but the unit wasn't a close fit. The solution they sent me was too small.I had to shim the key block to make it hold.PianoGate"
1,An Inferior Set of Headphones,As the old adage goes you get what you pay for. As a double insult I bought these at another site for two dollars more. The sound quality is totaly flat. Don't bother. Possibly a child might like these. But why instigate low quality expectations?
5,Love this salt,If you've ever tried this natural salt from France you know it's the best every-day salt around. I buy regularly and enjoy the best flavor when salt is needed for meals.
3,package sucks,"The salt is find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your salt is all over the floor."
5,Yugoslav pop band,"Viva Brown is actually the American release of Yugoslav band Eva Braun who changed their name in order to avoid unpleasant comparisons with the infamous female. They were found in Becej, Yugoslavia and ... This release is consisted of theis Yugoslav songs translated and sung in English. Thay play pure pop with influences by The Beatles, Beach Boys and The Byrds of the classics or The Wannadies, The Merrymakers and Teenage Fanclub of the new ones. Their quality is proved by the involvement in the International Pop Overthrow Festival a couple of years ago. Buy this one and dig up their other records."
2,It seemed to be more about the writing OF the book than the writing IN the book.,"I got about halfway through this book before realizing that I was just trying to get back some of my time investment. I hoped that it would become spellbinding and hilarious any second. I kept hoping and hoping, until my next requested library book became available and I realized that it was more appealing than the book (this one) that I had already started.The author really did seem to be just listing all the ways he got around writing a book about these nearly extinct deer. I don't know if he did this to stretch the book by a few hundred pages, but I found it dull. Too bad, too, because his tone was enjoyable to read."
5,Perfect.,"I picked this book up on the bargain rack of my local bookstore. I don't like to pass up a chance for a low-priced hardcover, and am I ever glad I didn't.Everyone will tell you this book is about deer. Not just any deer. Rare deer. But it's about so much more than that. Whether you see it as fact or fiction, or 'mostly true', the book is captivating. While seemingly hare-brained and madcap in its construction, the text flows together in a surreal way. Twigger penned the words perfectly, and it's a book not only for deer-lovers, but for writers, too.Because much of the book is about writing another book and finding book stores and raiding libraries and the like, anyone who loves books should also love it. I suppose I must have gotten lucky, liking both books and deer, with a slight bent for villains like the Major.It's hard to do the text justice. You'll just have to go read it yourself, I suppose."
1,too much autobiography,An unoriginal attempt of authoring a novel based on fractured accounts through the masculine line of the Twigger family tree. The book reminds me of a Simon Winchester styled writer who is too preoccupied with glorify his own accomplishments. I have read three Twigger books and so far they are lacking in story but not autobiography.
5,My new bible,The epitome of cult classic. Perfect picture of being thirteen with no condescension whatsoever. An absolute marvel. A true shame that Chris Fuhrman died so early.
4,Ah - to be so innocently naughty,"Hope the title of the review isn't too dorky, but I was impressed by (1) how well the book conveyed the innocence of young boys as well as (2) their talent for trouble. Adolescent Calvin perhaps.The terror and rebellion of Catholic school is brought back vividly.The wonder and amazement of discovering the opposite sex, when one is young, is is portraid incredibly. Again, this innocence / non-innocence.Not profound but engrossing and enjoyable."
4,well written and engaging,"It is difficult not to give this book a 5, as the author does a terrific job of bringing the freshness of experience and volatility of youth out with vivid characters, unpredictable plot and poetic turns of phrase. It's a clever spin on the coming of age novel, but doesn't have the resonance of a more heavyweight work. Overall a funny and poignant story, made more so by the unfortunate loss of the author."
5,Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys,"I have repeatedly read The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys over the past five years. It has been swapped from family member to family member and from friend to friend. The ability the book has to appeal to such a wide audience, and continually gain a person's interest (even after reading it several times before) amazes me. This charming coming of age novel speaks to the experiences and innocent emotions each of us encounters during the akward age of adolescence. Chris Fuhrman captures the true essence of growing up, and tells his story in a way that will captivate each of his readers"
3,I regret to write such a bad review,"I recently saw the movie then decided to read the book. Honestly, I think the movie was much more well done. I don't want to reveal anything about the book - but I do want to say that Fuhrman's writing is a little too brief. He also doesn't seem to have a grasp on some of the characters. The movie portrays their lives much more clearly. I'll stop here - but please SEE THE MOVIE - and avoid the book."
5,Brilliant,"This is an excellent, practical book. Very concise and to the point. The layout is super, the diagrams superb and has nice examples of CT and MRI scans."
2,not reliable,"At the first two days the product worked just fine (misty and quiet). After the second refilling the humidifier started to make noises (a motor like sound the first 10 minutes and heavy drops sound all the time). - So I had to return it.Secondly, to refill the tank you have to remove it and turn it upside down - Water always get spilled on my carpet during that process."
2,It's great...when it works,"I ordered and received this cute little number in January of this year. In March it started making a horrible, high-pitched grinding noise...like something had come loose inside of it. I have not yet contacted the manufacturer to see if it can be fixed. However, my son sleeps so much better when it is working and I hate the nights when the gosh darn thing refuses to work like it should. Based upon my experience thus far, I would not recommend this make/model to anyone else."
3,was good for the first 2 days until it broke...,I am hoping it was just a lemon.Worked great the first 2 days and stop using the water after that.My son has become accustomed to the soft hum it puts off at night.Need to try and get a replacement from the manufacturer.
1,"Cute, quiet, and WORTHLESS.","I wonder if any of the positive reviews for these ultrasonic humidifiers were done people who actually measured the humidity?I have three hygrometers in my house. I first set this up in the living room (over 2' off the floor as instructed). I ran it 24 hours, and neither they hygrometer directly over it nor the one across the room registered any increase in humidity.Well, I thought, the living room is kind of big... although you'd think at least the hygrometer only 3 feet from it would have gone up... so I put it in my 10x10 bedroom. 24 hours later the humidity had gone up a couple of percentage points - still only 25%. Then I put the hygrometer on the floor. Well, THAT registered a nice comfortable 50% humidity.At least my cats can enjoy it. I bought it at Target. I wonder how they are about returns on internet orders."
4,Alright!,"Just finished the book last night. I very much enjoyed reading it. The book was very interesting and kept my attention very well, I didn't put it down. Packed full of letters, diary entires, and maps, I was marching right along with the Third Virginia. Right on Mr. Cecere.Josh"
4,well written; just too short,"I bought this because I have an ancestor, Charles Lenox, who was a private in the 3rd VA during this period. He was wounded in the August-Sept period of 1777, and I wanted to get information about the regiment. I think, though I am not a historian, the book was well-written and did a good job of weaving John Chilton's diary into the narrative. The only thing I wish is that the book covered the entire war for the 3rd VA."
4,Very cute,"Any adult who's ever been some little kid's jungle gym will know exactly what this book is about. It's a small child's narration of what it takes to climb all the way to the top of Daddy. Fieffer inks the child in his familiar, engaging style, and renders Daddy as a grey monolith of charcoal drawing. (Mommy, of course, gets her own page at the end.)I have a niece who's an especially active sort, so she came ot mind immmediately when I saw this. The Daddy may not thank me, though, since the niece is likely to take this as an instruction manual.//wiredweirdPS: Is this really Feiffer, the angry young man of the 1950s and 60s? If so, it looks like he's evolved a doting grandfather. I guess half-a-hundred years will do that to a guy."
3,The Daddy Mountain Review,"I enjyed the story in this book however I did not feel the wording was the best. I don't know very many children that are able to read the word catastrophe in a book where the rest of the words are much easier to figure out. Beyond that, the story may have been more appealing to an adult that enjoys children more than to children which this book is supposed to be written for. The book had great pictures that would provide picture support and overall it was a decent book. It would not be highly reccomended by me."
5,2 year old loves it,"My two year old girl loves this book, and asks for it often. When we get to the word ""catastrophe"", she likes to yell it out loud (though it sounds more like 'atastrophe'!). The first time we read it, she set off to climb both the daddy mountain and mommy mountain."
2,Strange. Not written for children.,"This book reads strangely the whole way through, and the weird bold font matches. The text does not seem like what a child would say. Two mentions of the mommy or daddy getting ""mad"" are unnecessary. Last page has mommy about to faint because girl on daddy's shoulders--hello?? Has this author ever had children?"
4,Good History Yarn,Hard to believe what went on in rural America in the 20th Century. My father was a country doctor and made many a house call to the Shelton family with me bouncing along as his shield so he would not be mistaken for a Shelton. This book is throughly researched and organized to be a good page turner.
3,The Book,"Jumps around too much,not very well written. I feel I paid too much for this book. :0( Keepsake., I guess."
4,Great children's book,"Not many people know that Tolkien has written a book for children. I found it at a used bookstore a couple months ago, and it is fabulous. On a par with Curious George, Dr. Seuss, and the Berenstain Bears, I loved it! It's the perfect introduction for a youngster into the land of J.R.R. Tolkien."
4,Back Cover Description,"2000 A. D. - 2037 A. D. The biological time bomb has exploded and a brand new breed of human has taken shape...The Clones...There were five of them. Each a carbon copy of each other and of their father, the famous astrophysicist Paul Swenson. There were very few of these specially bred children at the beginning of the 21st century. And the Swenson clones became the target of much hostility and abuse. But they had been cloned for a purpose. And their creators were determined that they survive. This is their story, their dreams, their loves, their terrors and the strange destiny that kept them bound as one."
4,"Finally, a case that works!","I have had my Sam8500 for a while and could never find a case that works for me. This case gives me easy access to the phone and adds a little bulk to talk with handset on my shoulder (while looking for my hands free). The swivel clip is great for clipping to my purse strap so I don't have to dig. You have to love the quick release button for quick answering. The only drawbacks I see are; you have to take it all the way out of the case to charge the phone, so the earpiece hood gets streatched out of shape. Also the indicator light for incomming calls is covered by the case so in loud areas you could miss calls, if the phone is not pressed to your body on vibrate. But all in all, FINALLY, a case that works."
4,gang starr the gods,theyre the geniouses of this rap game guru and premier this is more of a bootleg album but still caines!! buy it!!
1,?This is a learning toy?,"Where is the skill or learning in this? What a let down. Not much more to it than screwing the cover on and then cranking and cranking, and cranking, and then when your arm is exhausted crank some more...ok turn on the radio...it plays for 30 seconds...then it is time to crank again and crank, and crank and crank and crank, and play for about 30 seconds. If this toy is to teach a child to be discouraged by electronics...then job accomplished!"
4,Only for Older Children!,"Contrary to some of the previous reviews and the materials from the company, the American Academy of Pediatricians and many, many highway safety organization recommend that children remain in a harnessed carseat until at least 4 years old AND 40 pounds. That is also the law in many states. Children younger/smaller than that are not nearly as safe in a booster as they would be in a harnessed car seat. And, in answer to an earlier review, all carseats and boosters expire - the length of time they last varies from 5 to 8 years. After that date, the plastic starts to break down and the seat is no longer safe.That being said, the Compass is a great option for school age children and the folding option makes it especially convenient."
5,I Go Pogo,"The Pogo Sunday Parade is an excellent book. Even though it's 58 years old, it's still quite relevant. My favorite character is Albert the Alligator, especially when he winds up with an octopus on his head. Walt Kelly was a genius. I heartily recommend this book to anyone, especially a diehard Pogo fan such as myself."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Storm Riders is a wonderful movie. Ground-breaking for a HK movie. However, A Man Called Hero is one of the worst movies I have seen. Yeah, great special effects, some of the fight scenes were amazing. However, if you are not familiar with the comic book series, you will be lost.The story jumps around, NO Character development, essentially, a piece of crap made to try and show off Centro's CGI capabilities. Big Deal.Don't believe the hype about ""Oh...from the makers of The Storm Riders....Oh...a modern retelling of the Blood Sword saga""...crap I tell you, Everyone gave it four or five stars just because of the special effects...sigh."
1,You call this a movie?,"This is one of the worst movies ever made.Pro: Good fighting scene.Con: A completely [...bad] plot and unrealistic acting that just makes you go ['huh?'], after watchin the movie for 10 minutes I ended up fast forwarding to the fighting scenes and wanting it to end as quickly as possible.I was expecting something along the lines of storm rider since it is by the same director, but you cant even compare the two movie.Leave this one on the shelf."
2,"Nice try, but a disappointing failure","As ""cute"" as Nicholas Tse and Ekin Cheng might be, even their ""pretty"" faces couldn't save this film. ""A Man Called Hero"" (the prequel to top-grossing movie in HK cinematic history, ""Storm Riders"") was a disappointment. After watching the first half, one can't even bring himself/herself to justice by finishing the second half. Although the movie does have potential with a nice love story, an attempt of flashbacks and kung-fu completely ruined the movie. Don't get ""A Man Called Hero."" Instead, get ""The Storm Riders."" - Priscilla"
4,not on dvd,the movie is excellent. my problem was that you have it only on vhs. i don`t want another vhs copy. when and if it comes out on dvd i will be the first to snap this up.
3,Should actually get 2 1/2 stars,"I've been a fan of the Blood Sword books by Tony Wong since they made their way to the U.S., but this movie left much to be desired. If u didnt read the comics like my friend that watched the movie with me, you'll probably have a few questions that will need to be answered after watching it. The special effects are also pretty substandard compared to other movies that have been made recently in its genre. Rent it instead of buying."
4,Awesome! Matrix my ass! =),"A Man Called Hero was the bomb of CGI movies! Well it would've got 5 stars except The Stormriders (same crew who made this movie) took it away! My friends all shrugged me off when I said this is one of the movies that would refrain you from watching The Matrix. Man, they didn't even see this movie yet! SFX is great except for some fake looking parts at the ending, story is sad and I guess was meant that way. Ekin Cheng is my favorite HK movie hero along with Nicholas Tse (Ekin's son in th movie)! Plus the finale battle is intensely climatic (man those guys save the best fight for the last). I love CGI battles and this is one of the best, second only to The Stormriders! Check it out!"
3,"Just ""Good"" samurai flick","I think it's all been said before. The fight scenes are hot but the story is slow. I maybe wrong, but you kind of tell that New York China Town isn't NYC and it might be a movie set, kind of like all outside scenes on Seinfeld. But, nonetheless, if you need to crave your sweettooth for another samurai movie, watch it.Rent-YesBuy-Maybe"
1,Ewwww that smell...,"this stinks...Buy Flying Daggers, [just plain] HERO, or buy Fong Sai Yuk at an online retailer..."
3,Make sure you DO NOT get the world media verison.,"Now the film itself as far as I could tell was a good story that was all fantasy but real emotions. I really liked it but canot say that I appreciate the version that i recieved from a seller on amazon:(The world media version is cut by at least 15 minutes and most of this musta been action cause I didn't see shlt. I heard the movie was bloody, nop, didn't get that. Which proves, you need to see the full 119 minute version of this. Also kungfucinema saisd the pictrue quality was great, world media version SUCKS!!!!!!!!!So please people, DO NTO BUY THE WORLD MEDIA VERSION OF THIS. I am sure it is a good film, but thought it was average after one viewing and may watch it again but I was irate upon finding out I got a cut version and will for sure sell this at the local used store the first chance i get."
3,MET FAN,"THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT I GOT!I HAVE BEEN WEARING MY METS JACKET SINCE,UNTIL I NOTICED A RIP IN THE RIGHT SLEEVE.NOW MY JACKET IS IN MY CLOSET WAITING FOR A REPAIR.PLEASE HELP!I WANT BE A PROUD FAN AGAIN."
2,Yuck,"I guess there's a benefit to all this pared-down Sondheim stuff, but I just really don't think this can come close to shaking at stick at the English National Opera cast. And I'm sorry, but B.D. Wong's voice is just too Charlie Brown. Buy the original London cast if you don't know the show; it is so much better.Pacific Overtures (1987 English National Opera Cast)"
3,Interesting But Stick To The Original,"Although Sondheims delightful score has been pared down a bit, this is still a nice recording of the show, but I prefer the fullscale OBC version in all it's grand magnificence. Not my favorite Sondheim, but still compelling and interesting, and a must have for any SS collection."
3,Mixed at best,"I give this recording as many as 3 stars only for the vocals. But I find this pared-down, watered-down orchestration almost unlistenable. I feel as though I'd walked in on a vocal rehearsal! This gorgeous score deserves better: a full symphonic orchestra (the same can be said of Passion, a Little Night Music, and Sweeney Todd, whose music was similarly tortured and constricted in the 2005 minimalist Broadway revival). The musical impact of so many of the songs here is lost, most particularly with the superb Someone in a Tree, which comes off very flat compared to its performance in the 1976 original Broadway cast album; I really miss the full string section there. Get the 1976 recording instead, or, for something equally as off-beat as this infinitesimally-orchestrated production, get the 1987 English National Opera recording, currently available from Amazon Marketplace, with a full opera orchestra and trained voices - or get them both. This recording pales in comparison."
4,Nice recording and great for a collection,"No great advances, here, but just a good, competent recording of the show, which provides a good ""bookend"" to the original recording. Some extra music and dialog as well, a nice bonus to further flesh out the show. Not a necessity if you already own the original, but a nice addition."
2,Merely ok,"I love B.D. Wong, so I picked up this cd. For the most part, I found the music neither intersting or memorable."
2,Sad Sondheim,"Sometimes composers have great ideas. Sometimes they aren't really that great. This is one of those times. The Sondheim name might make you think of Company, Into the Woods, Sweeny Todd, but this should not be thought of in the same way. The singers are bad. The lyrics are bad. The thought that this is a great CD is wrong. Maybe seeing the show would make listening to it differently, but that's not what I'm reviewing. I have enjoyed much of Sondheim and was eager to enjoy this, but found myself embarrassed at how awful it was. I forced myself to finish it, but it wasn't worth it. Don't make the mistake of buying this CD unless you are a collector. Sorry Sondheim, but this is sad. Favorite Song: ""Pretty Lady"" (but the singers are awful!)"
3,A comprehension history of the game of golf,I bought this book to help in my search on the beginnings of the game of golf. The book was well written and the photos were appreciated as well.
5,Their 3 first CDs in one package,"This box set consists of their first three CDs: ""Cafe Tacuba"", the mind-blowing ""Re"", and the inventive covers album ""Avalancha de Exitos"". These are all classics; I don't think I have very much to add to their reviews here in Amazon. This box set is a great buy."
3,Capy,This light does what it says it will do but for the money the Chauvet 400G is a much better light. I have both and the DF FS-1000 really burns HOT and the light is not as white as the 400G.
1,skeptic,"I thought as for my mother because she suffers from arthritis. It didn't work maybe because her arthritis is too advanced, she had her knee operated and now feels much better. I guess in some cases its a little too late..."
5,Good CD,"The greatest strength of this CD is the sheer variety of material - from the hip-hop resembling ""Revolution"" to John Coltrane's ""Alabama."" This is a very solid CD with an excellent sampling. Highly recommended."
2,Kids Liked It Until It Conked Out,"I would urge you not to buy this, especially through the mail. It is a cute-enough toy, though it goes thru batteries and the screen display is pretty unimpressive (it's not a digital screen, just a brief loop going around in the machine). My two year old and four year old enjoyed it. HOWEVER, the screen started cutting out then stopped working altogether after just a few weeks. I took it back to Toys R Us for a refund. Glad I didn't have to ship it back thru the mail. Shipping it back would've been a real pain and expensive after it had been put together, and because it's so bulky."
1,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with the screen machine. I paid over $[...] and I thought it was very expensive for what you get. There is only one road to drive on, no other programs, paper road that sticks. For the money you would think that they could have had a computer screen and different programs. It is very loud. I goes up to 59lbs, my son is only 40lbs and he can't keep his feet on the pedals since the handles hit his knees."
5,He's Right - No Doubt About It!!!,"You either love him or hate him. With Sir Charles there is no gray in between - it's either black or white. This book is a comfortable easy read (one night, maybe two.) It's like having a long conversation with an old friend. You don't have to agree with everything he says. You don't have to like everything he says. But in the end he's still someone you're glad to have the time to talk with."
1,"I thought this was going to be funny, but I doubt it.","I guess I should have investigated this book a little more before buying it. I thought it was going to be about Charles' life in the NBA. He is so funny, but in this book, it is only his political and racial opinions and I am not interested in that. I was very disappointed."
2,He's Had Better Magazine Articles,"I bought this book at first sight as Charles Barkley is one of my favorite athletes, and one of the best sources of entertaining and memorable quotes/observations in the past 15 years. Sadly, this book was a big disappointment. One wouldn't expect deep thought analysis or high journalism with this book, but instead entertaining commentary and observations that is Charles' trademark to compensate. While the former holds true, the latter is missing. What the reader is ultimately left with is a book that could have been written by any athelete, and you wouldn't be able to differentiate the voice as belonging to Charles. The special quality that makes Charles interesting and unique simply is not present in the book. It pains me to say this as one of his biggest fans, but this book simply isn't the same Charles."
3,"Same Charles, Different Format","With the help of sportswriter Michael Wilbon, Charles Barkley is able to put together a book that rambles throughhis thoughts and opinions on just about everything. But for a man like Charles Barkley, that works out just fine.Never known for pulling punches, Barkley speaks on everything from growing up poor to life now rich, raisingkids, taking responsibility for one's actions, and of course politics in America. It pretty much what you would expectfrom a personality like Charles Barkley. A good, but not spectacular book."
2,Not as mind blowing as Barkley thinks it is.,"Chuck figures he's blown the lid off by stating the obvious about racism, poverty, politics.He hasn't. At best, he's shown he paid attention to the world surrounding him. It doesn't make him special. And it doesn't make his book any kind of epiphany.Barkley spends the opening chapter bemoaning reporters of the sproting genre who just didn't care about his worldviews. The reason, painfully obvious, is that they didn't care about his worldviews. His aren't the original theories he figures they are -- they've been around for, oh, 50 damn years -- though they may be original for the 21st Century athlete.Barkley's better off striking a posture and leaving it that."
1,Don't waste your time,"I could not even get through the first chapter, Charles is not as good as he thinkes he was. I would read bootlegger's boy by Berry Switzer famous coach of the oklahoma sooners if I were looking for a good book to read."
4,Not a history of 'One Hour Martinizing'....,"A superbly edited work of staggering genius. The only way to top the enjoyment I derived from reading this book is to turn it into an animated spectacular utilizing the voices of the cast of ""Seinfeld.""Move over Eldridge Cleaver and H. Rap Brown. Sir Charles is now in charge. Also, the cover photograph makes an excellent head-on-a-stick for those inclined to tackle a craft project of moderate difficulty. Instructions are included on the inside of the back jacket cover. With Trick or Treat season upon us, why not use your crafty Barkley head for your next ""Ugliest Man in America"" cocktail party."
2,I'm positive. You are definitely wrong all the time,"I never read this book and would not take advice from a player who has never won an NBA championship and plays golf like Corky from ""Life Goes On"". He has always had a big mouth but as it turns out now he has nothing left to back it up with. At least he got a show where he has a reason to have a big mouth. I'll give him credit for that."
4,keep talking,"the thing about the book that stands out the most, is that charles barkley took out time to "" write a book "" on some things that were important; not only to him, but to the average person that relates and understands those concerns. how many pro sports figures even care to do something like this???"
3,Some gems amid the rambling . . .,"I found this book to be interesting, but somewhat repetitive. On several occasions, Barkley repeats points brought up in previous chapters. His premise for the book is to bring up subjects of a socially sensitive nature, and in that he succeeds, although not consistently enough. I found the book to read like a long ramble. There are many good points and thought-provoking statements made, but you have to sift through the ramble to find them. The book is an easy read (big print, big margins) and can be knocked off in one evening."
3,You get what you pay for,"We bought this to install hard wood flooring that could not be installed using a floor nailer. It worked moderately well, but is definitely not a heavy duty machine."
3,Not for 8260,"The three stars has nothing to do with the quality of the case. Amazon.com offers this as compatible for the 8260 - do not buy this for your 8260, it doesn't fit!!"
3,3.5 stars,"I bought this for my Nokia 8200 series phone - the phone looks exactly like the one pictured above. As far as some of the comments on the fit, when the case is new it is very snug and hard to snap close, but does stretch a little over time where it gets easier to close. That is one of the things I like about the case - it doesnt add any real thickness to the phone but still protects it and looks good. I have dropped it at least 10 times on hard surfaces with no damage. I know other people that have dropped the same phone without a case and the display cracks easily. My only disappointment and why I give it 3.5 is the clip - it has fallen off my belt several times without a whole lot of force. The clip is strong, but it will move on your belt when getting in and out of the car fairly easily or brushing it with something. The phone is so light you wont even know its missing. I actually lost the phone this way, but amazingly enough someone left me a voice mail and returned it."
3,it's okay,"I just opened my DVD and used it to workout. Beginners of course!The workout is good, it made my heart beat go up but there were a lot of areas that can be improved.1) The actors never (until the very end) encourage the viewers to work out. I think if they added `you can do it', `don't give up' during the cardio sessions it would help.2) The actors assume everyone out there knows how to do squats. Typically when you buy work out DVDs it talks about posture. How to stand, knees bent, squat like you are trying to sit on a chair, check your posture, there was none of that.3) The actors did not count, that is 1, 2, 3, 10... 4 more to go.4) If you love bollywood music, it has the option to play that. This is a plus.5) In the beginning the DVD focused on the actors face but really... I think focusing on how she is working out would have been a better option.Over all 3.5! If all the above points were included then a 4.5!"
5,"Annoying music, awesome moves","The only downer on this video, is the soundtrack ""Love Yourself"" playing over and over for 25 minutes. However, I still gave it 5 stars because there is an option to change the music to Bollywood soundtracks which is much better in my opinion. I was really surprised by this video. It really works! I use 5 pound weights so it makes my workout a challenge (for me anyways). I do it with my friends sometimes or on my own. I like that I don't need a lot of equipment in order to do this video. I think that a real challenge would be to do the beginners video and the advanced in one workout. That would be hard! The fact that its cardio, weight lifting and circuit training in only 25 min makes it an A+ because it takes care of everything and will give you results."
5,Great workout video,"It is a very good workout video. It has 2 levels, one for beginners and one for advanced. Each workout is is like a circuit training. The timer on the screen is a great feature. Narration is apt. You can listen to Bollywood music while working out which I am not sure is very synchronized with the workout."
2,Not for beginners,I bought this book to learn ASP after reading all the positive ratings. This little book starts with the examples and then give you only hints here and there. If you have no knowledge of ASP beforehand you simply get lost in no time. This may be a good book for experienced webdesigners or tutors to use as a tool. For beginners it is not on.
2,Examples OK but CODE is an embarrassment,"I have been out of coding for a few years, so picked this book up to teach myself ASP. Did it teach it to me? Yes. But considering that he has been teaching for as long as he claims the coding standards are _shocking_. Any programmer with half an ability knows that the bad old day of few comments and zero indentation are a thing of the past. I found following the code near to impossible, I have not seen code this badly formatted and written in twenty years since I first started coding. Robert B Mellor should be embarrassed, I am for him!"
4,Great Start Up Book,"I just started to learn ASP. I have programming experience so it was relatively easy for me. This book has great, easy, PRACTICLE examples for what you would use in a real-life application! It delivers that reasonably well. In addition, explanation of ASP basics done very well. On the other hand, I wish the code examples could have been formatted better for easier reading; for example, perhaps the keywords could have been in a different color, and use of indentation inside loops, and If..Then..Else statements, would make for easier reading. Overall, great book, great price!"
3,"Not bad, not great",This book did a good job preparing you for what happens before and during the surgery as well as while in the hospital afterwards. But it didn't really say as much about the recovery period at home. Plus our recovery period at home lasted way longer then it did for the girl in the book. The book was also lengthy so it was hard to keep the attention of my four year old at times.
5,Great book for preschoolers,"I bought this book for my 3.5 year old. It covered all the details, including getting a bracelet, changing pj's, watching TV, doctors with masks, a very sore throat, how important it is to drink a lot, etc. She was thoroughly relaxed. We also had a Goodbye Tonsils party at her school, complete with a cake, like in the book. My daughter loved it, and it helped her say goodbye to her friends for a week. I was pretty impressed."
5,Very Good Story,I searched high and low for books dealing with tonsilectomies and ear tubes and was shocked to find out that the selection was so limited. This book was quite the find however and my daughter really enjoyed it. I think she identified with the young author and the tone of the book. It really did a great job preparing her for her surgery and she even looked forward to it. I would highly recommend this book for any child facing a tonsilectomy.
2,Did Not Work,Tried everything humanly possible to get this thing to work with no success. Followed all instructions perfectly and went online to download alternate instructions for my specific GM model which still did not help.
2,Not quite what I was hoping for,"Does serve as a reasonable data backup disk, but sometimes produces errors when copying files. I cannot use it as a startup disk.Later - I am just experiencing too many disk problems with the product. I cannot recommend it at all.Revised summary: Totally worthless."
1,Disappointed! Wouldn't buy again.,This worked great for about 3 days. Then it sporadically wouldn't be recognized. I had to keep reformatting it. Now it would be totally wothless other than I salvaged a little frustration by mounting the hard drive internally in the computer and that works well. I think the problems are with the enclosure.
1,A totally unreliable product,"The rate for this product should be -10. I bought this external hard drive in 2004, saved a couple of files, and used it sporadically (I have other hard drives... different brand though). After 1 and a half year the product started failing (bad sectors), and after 2 years I got more bad sectors. I can't even format the disk. The warranty of this product is 1 year, and the only advice of their customer service is to buy a new one. They told me that to repair the product would cost more than buying a new one. Now it's a piece of junk in my room."
3,a bit unstable,Been using it for about two years now. It is an ok product for its price. Not too good.The drive was unstable and use to give hardware failure a lot of times. Then once it completely crashed. I have to send it to Fantom for a replacement. I for the replacement in about 4 weeks and all my data was lost (as expected). They don't recover your data and if you want to do so you have to send it to a data-recovery company and pay for it.The replacement part is with me for more than an year. I keep it as a backup of another external hard drive and do not keep it connected all the time.
3,Not a bad compliation of Hits,"This is the closest to a Greatest Hits album that Ambrosia will ever get - after all, they only put out around four albums total! One thing I really missed was the sequencing of the original Ambrosia album, but the music is great!"
4,Magical Mystery Is Missing!,"It's a mystery why Magical Mystery Tour is missing. Ambrosia did a cover of this great Beatles tune in 1977 for the soundtrack of ""All This And World War II."" The song made it to #39 on the U.S. Billboard Top 100. This great cover of Magical Mystery Tour, which featured also the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, should have been included in this anthology as should a few other tunes, most notably the great song ""Make Us All Aware"" from their first, self-titled LP. I suggest you get not only this excellent compact disc, but also their first LP, now remastered on compact disc and their CD ""One Eighty."" Great music. Great band."
4,Awesome,"After twenty years, a woman who I knew in high school and I met again. We drank some wine and listened to this CD.I don't need to say anymore"
3,Ambrosia on the side,"Ambrosia at the local deli is popular; whipped cream, coconut, pineapple, half a cherry, a treat.Ambrosia at the local Top 40 is much the same, a big seller, filled w/marshmallow vocals, easy as puddin' guitars, and achin' cherry popped songs that melt the gal next to ya.Ambrosia at its best was Bread with memorable hits as, ""Biggest Part of Me"", ""You're The Only Woman"". ""Nice Nice Nice"" (with lyrics by Kurt Vonnegut !), while apparently in a good relationship, and late '70's hits of ""Holdin' On to Yesterday"", and ""How Much I Feel"", all yearning pretty while uhmm not so much.This is a fine example of 1970's pop song writing and performance. It also may make some tear up. That would not be an allergic reaction, but a heartfelt reminiscence of a side salad of mixed fruit and bittersweet memories."
3,"Good for hits, the rest...so-so","Their hits are great tunes. I bought the disc for those. I do listen to the cd occasionally, but I don't care for the non-hits very much. The group is very competent, musically but it just doesn't do much for me."
5,"AWESOME, the best band EVER!","Why Ambrosia does not get air play is beyond me, they need to bring alot of the bands from the 70's and 80's back to show our kids what true music is. PERIOD!Also does anyone know who to get lyrics to Ambrosia songs?I've tried Lyrics.com and other web pages, no luck.Any help would be greatly appreciated.THANKS!"
4,Close to the original....,"An excellent compilation of songs from an overlooked band from the seventies....Sky is Falling is an fantastic representation of what this group of four individuals is capable of producing even late into the 90's. However, my favorite album still has to be Ambrosia...the original recording. Produced by Alan Parsons fresh from his work on Floyds Dark Side of the Moon, Emotions run high on the best piece of work ever put on vinyl...Drink of Water. Hope for the best to get this recording re- released. Check out Ambrosia's web site if you would like, or drop me a line at MagicFen@aol.com."
4,More hits than misses.,"Sometimes it sounds like two bands are on this album--are they a bombastic art-rock quartet like Queen, or laid-back Doobie Brothers-circa-""Minute by Minute"" wannabes? Knowing only their hits, I was pleasantly surprised by album rockers like ""Nice, Nice, Very Nice,"" ""Life Beyond L.A.,"" and ""Time Waits For No One."" But their nineties material, while super-polished, was bland and disappointing--you know you're in trouble when a song (""I Just Can't Let Go"") starts off with a quasi-soulful ""hoooo"" a la Michael Bolton. As for some of their better-known tracks, ""How Much I Feel"" grabs you with its lyrical poignancy and cinematic way of building to a climax. ""Biggest Part of Me,"" despite having that classic electric-piano sound and characteristically jazzy chords, crosses the fine line between romantic and corny and must have prompted cries of ""sellout!"" from some fans. Bottom line: even if you only know their hits you will like most of these songs."
4,Good solid Disc,"Ambrosia are a solid Band.I Grew up digging their music.Biggest Part Of Me is a Great song.also I dug Time Waits for no one,I Just Can't Let Go with James Ingram&Michael Mccdonald& of course How Much I Feel.alot of folks can Relate to that song.this is a Good solid disc."
5,Timeless music from the best rock band ever,"For those of you who truly appreciate music with incredible harmonies and lyrics that touch your heart and soul, then look no further, this CD is a must-have for your collection! Of course, you'll love ""How Much I Feel"" and ""You're The Only Woman""(who doesn't?),which showcase David Pack's unbelievable voice!!! There's no other male singer who even comes close to his musical range and emotional power. Also, check out the hauntingly beautiful ""Heart to Heart"" and the classic ""Cowboy Star."" This CD is a refreshing welcome to all the garbage that is supposed to be ""music"" on the radio these days. Great music from the 70's - 90's.....simply timeless."
5,Ambrosia is a great soft rock group,I absolutely love the song Holding on to Yesterday!! It is a beautiful song.
5,A glimpse into a hidden world,"Beautifully written and thoroughly researched. Snow Flower and Lily are characters that will linger in your mind. Often their love for each other, which they kept alive with their nu shu secret writings, was what sustained them through their difficult and painful lives. It is an invaluable window into the lives of Chinese women in the 19th century."
5,Beautiful,This book was just a beautiful story. The imagery of the chinese wedding customs of the time and the horrific descriptions of foot binding were amazing. The connection between the main characters and their need for love in a world in which women were considered worthless was powerful.This is a must read!
5,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,A wonderful look into the history of the binding of the women's feet in China. Very insightful and full of descriptive passages. I was at once intrigued and absorbed into the culture of this period.
3,Good read - but a little overdone,"This novel does present insight on 19th century China with foot binding and the customs of Chinese marriages at the time. It was an interesting read in that aspect. However, the story line between the 2 female characters was a little overdrawn and exaggerated, the author never gets you really into the story and you don't have develop much feeling for Snow Flower and what she is going through. If you want a book that is a little less 'dry' I would recommend Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress."
5,Great book!,"This was a book club pick for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I loved learning about the lifestyle and traditions of China in the 1800-1900's. It is a sad, touching, beautifally written story."
3,Difficult to stay with but worth hanging in there,"I enjoyed this book overall, but it was a little difficult to stay with at times. It's not that long, but it felt like it took me forever to read. It's definitely worth reading to gain some insight into Chinese culture."
4,Loved,"I really loved this book.However, probably not 100% accurate.I LOVE to know that my historical fiction is accurate (perhaps to I can delude myself into thinking I am learning something while indulging in my fiction addiction ;o)Regardless, the story was both engaging and interesting and I think researched and an attempt was made at accuracy."
1,A failed attempt,"I have a habit of finishing a book I start. However, this was one of the very few books I stopped reading in the middle. I am not Chinese and I can not claim I know a lot about China and its history. But even with that small amount of knowledge I could feel that an author has absolutely no understanding of Chinese culture. Lisa Lee used her European mentality to explain to a reader mentality of an Asian person which gave a very distorted view of the East. I admire Lisa Lee's attempt on getting to know Chinese culture, on effort she put on collecting the information. She really tried. But she failed. She failed as a writer and as a historian."
3,disappointed,The topic was intesting but the story fell short. Characters were weak and timing of events in the story was irratic. I really thought this would be better based on the reviews. Readable but not recommended. Read the back cover and you will save yourself some time.
2,Misery personified,"This book gives a lot of descriptive information on life in China in the early 19th century, but there just was no joy in the book for me at all. Women had miserable lives and were powerless to do anything about it. The book was very well written, but I just was not in a place in my life where I needed or wanted to read this book--it was a book club selection. I mean no criticism to the author who did an excellent job--I just did not like the subject matter."
3,"interesting, engrossing...but something is missing",I really enjoyed this book...however when the book ended I really felt like something was missing and quickly forgot about the book....however I can say that was really the only criticism...I felt like the pace moved quickly and the plot and character development was very interesting. I felt for the girls when they went through all the major events in life together and it made me sad when the ending finally came...as I felt like something still needed to happen...
5,Enjoyable and Enriching,"I brought this book with me to read last Easter, when I went on a week's holiday with my daughters. I bought the book, but had no expectation before I opened it to read.It is s story told in first person, of the friendship that binds two Chinese women. The book is filled with information on chinese culture of the time, something that should appeal to readers curious about this, like myself. This information is part of the story, so you learn as you get immersed into the main character's life story.I did not put the book down until I reached that last page, and I was sorry when the story finally ended - so sorry that I had to read the first page again.I loved it!"
4,good book!,"A very good book; helped me to get some knowledge about nu shui,a language I knew nothing about. I am looking forward to exploring more by Lisa See."
5,Walk A Mile,"This book is wonderful in showing what it is like to to be female in another time and culture.As a novel it has twists and turns that capitvate and enthrall you. The hoy and sadness is tangible. You simply cannot put this book down. It is not all sweetness and light and is far from happy as you follow the women, there life and relationships.Without a doubt I recommend this book."
4,Women's fate,"Interesting, stimulating. While playing in 19th century China, much can be learned from it today. Easy to read. Exciting."
5,"A beautiful book, easy read, hard-to-put-down, great for discussions","This book was beautifully written! The story drew me into it and I was emotionally invested in each character. It is an easy read and I found myself glued to it, even reading it at red lights as I drove. The humor is amazing. The themes are beautiful but haunting as well. Foot-binding is one of the major themes in the book. The author somehow is able to straight forwardly describe the foot-binding with such beauty yet also demonstrating the horrors of it as well.I read this for a book club and it brought up many thought-provoking discussions in our group. The discussions about food in the book also inspired us to bring Asian-inspired dishes as we talked about the characters an themes in the book. I highly recommend this novel. Though some of the adult themes are not too explicit, I would say that this novel would not be appropriate for those under 16 (at least)."
2,pim,"Along and convoluted story, waffles on a bit too much for me.I found I had to read the book in small slabs to get through it."
2,Disappointing,I was hoping this book would be like an Amy Tan book. I had a hard time getting through it though. I was disappointed. It's not that good.
4,A very Appealing and Fascinating Story,"I thought this novel gave a very fascinating description of the Chinese culture, the role of women; their hardships, companionship and struggle to survive. As the story moved along I also got a real education into the barbaric practice of foot binding. I shutter even as I type that word. Overall, I got the feeling I was sitting in a history class and the author was the professor lecturing on China's past. I never felt I was reading a novel because the author never flushed out the main characters and the plot was weak. However the subject matter was so interesting that I still enjoyed the novel. It's an interesting story and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"China is an interesting country and one that Americans don't know much about other than that it is on the other side of the world and we like chinese food. This book gives you an inside view of family life in China and the role of women in the 18th and 19th century. It doesn't make judgements of what was right or wrong, but lets the reader see the situation and decide for himself."
3,the end is disappointing,"While the book is very good, and the historical context is very interesting, I found that the 'misunderstanding' to which the blurb alludes is not as tragic as the rest of the book suggests it will be. The climax is not as exciting as it could have been."
3,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,This book would not be a first choice for me. It was purchased for a book group to which I belong. I have mixed feelings about this book. The cultural differences were both interesting and disturbing - difficulty reading the foot binding process particularly. There were similar reactions from the members of the book group.
4,If only.....,"This was a wonderfully written tale of love and friendship and devotion. I kind of wished it had been longer! That was the only draw-back. When I finished it, it left me wanting more. I sifted through the end of the book trying to read more of the author's notes or club questions just to dig a little bit more out of it.I bawled my eyes out at the end. The book also made me research more on bounded feet online and about nu shu.It's a quick entertaining and enlightening read."
4,How a sworn sisterhood changed the fate of two women in 19th century China,"I'll start by saying that this is not the type of book I normally read. However, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a great work of fiction that depicts what women's lives were like in China during the 19th century. The narrative is about two women who become laotong (lifelong sworn sisters) at a young age. The book follows the women's relationship as well as their living and family situations from their youths through their elder years. This book touched me and really demonstrates the power of female bonds and how they can be even more influential than the relationship between spouses. This book makes you appreciate how many opportunities women have in the 21st century that we take for granted and how our place in society is vastly different today. Snowflower and the Secret Fan is beautifully written and I plan on reading more of the author's novels."
4,Well written and vivid with details,"This book was well written. The story was very vivid, with lots of detail. I could visualize the places and things described very easily. The story was pretty fast paced as well. The story is multifaceted and has a lot of different things to mull over, more that I've covered in this short review. I felt for these two girls turned women, but in the end all of what they endured was a direct result of the world they lived in. Sad and unfortunately, but it is what it is.Check out my full review here: [...]"
5,Loved it!,I loved this book. Couldn't put it down and even though it was during a work week I finished it in 5 days.
4,Great Story,"I can't comment on whether or not this book is 100% accurate as far as Chinese history and culture goes, but it was a wonderful story. I don't want to give too much away, but just want to say that I loved it. The love that these women had for one another really touched me. It made me wish that I had a laotong. I cried during the final chapters, and that is how I know it was a good read. It is not often I cry while reading books, but I could see the scenes happening before me, and hear music in my head (that I hope to hear when I see the movie in a few weeks!), and all of it made me weep. The story was exquisite."
4,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,Beautiful story showing the importance of friendship between women; especially in a culture that insists upon these friendships being further down the list of priorities.
3,sdon,"The sadness throughout this book resonated with me as a mother, a daughter, a friend. However, I found it difficult to relate to the character Lily. Her arrogance in her good fortune made her cold, and she lacked empathy to those she loved the most. From the age of 80, she looked back on her life with regret, but with some sense of justification for her behaviour, buried deep in traditions and superstitions. This book is a compelling read about how women struglle, not only in this time and setting, but in today's modern world. However, the author drops some moments of compassion also for the men in the story, and the sorrows they too bear."
5,Captivating,I can honestly say that this is the first book that made me sob uncontrollably in the end. The tale is heart wrenching yet beautifully written.
3,"It's okay, for a soap opera","HIGHLY recommended by a reader friend--I found it interesting at first, an easy read. But as time passed...it devolved (maybe always was?) into a telenovela...a soap opera. Got bored, but of course felt guilty. Why hadn't I loved. Dumped the other book of her's I had. Not for every one."
3,fair quality,The book is in fair quality. The pages cutting are not good though. But it's still good for this price.
4,Fun read,This book was a breeze thru read. It is captivating and haunting. It makes you hungry for more. A door into a hidden lifestyle we have yet to touch. Thanks Lisa for a great book. Just like her to present an indepth study into a culture that is very secretative. Loved it.
1,Waited and waited for it to get better....it didn't,"Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews. Perhaps I was spoiled by ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""The Good Earth"", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring. Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice! Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it!"
1,Tedious read,After buying into the hype I bought this book. Needless to say I wished I had borrowed it from the library so that I could return it with haste and not be out of pocket $11. I read the book and found the writing slow and plodding and tedious. The writer was not at all skillful at creating page turning imagery. I continued reading in the false hope that the book and the character development would get better.Down to the last page it did not. The book was a disappointment for me and blah.
3,I liked it but didn't love it!,"Overall I have to say I liked this book. It certainly held my interest and I looked forward to my reading time with it. The era was interesting and the author truly knew her material to produce a good workof historical fiction. My complaint about the book is that it left me a tad dry. I felt Lisa See only glazed the surface with the story and even with the characters. I would have loved more exploration on Lily's part about how she went from suffering the agony of foot binding and blaming her mother's need to gain social status through the process to binding her own daughters' and granddaughter's feet. I also didn't get enough of the sense of the rift between Snow Flower and Lily. I also was left wondering about the women's responses to the men in their lives and the treatment of them....not enough explanation about Snow Flower's eldest son either.So...I'd probably recommend this book but for me, I needed MORE from it."
4,Memorable!,"I loved this book, it is set in China of a hundred years ago or so and gives a vivid and compelling portrayal of a woman of a certain class growing uo in China during that time. I wont re hash the plot in this review others have done that very well. The poignancy of this story stayed with me for a long time .The description of the foot binding process was so detailed and graphic that my feet actually ached for days, that chapter is not for the squeamish."
5,Wow! A wonderfully rich story- my highest recommendation.,"I looked at some of the other reviews before writing this. I saw that there were 2 or so out of the 20 or so total that I looked at which were negative. I can't believe anyone wouldn't find this book to be incredible. I know we all have different tastes and all but please- it is just one of those amazing stories that anyone could relate to- life, love, the bonds of friendship, struggles, and family. Lisa See tells this story in a way that unfolds like her fan in the story. She is a highly skilled writer who lets the words melt in our mouth as we savor what we read. This is truly a beautiful story."
5,Snow Flower Secret Fan,"As an Asian American and having lived in China for four years and Asia for a total of twelve, most books on Chinese culture sadly don't teach me much anymore. This book, however, is the product of intensive research and I was pleased to learn more about bound feet, nu shu (women's writing) the old traditions of marrying out and more about the Taiping Rebellion. It is also extrememly well-written and engaging, a rare book that kept me up until 2am reading!"
4,Inside Chinese Women's hearts,"This is a beautiful novel yet harsh as it opens our eyes on women's fait in China in the early century. You can smell the smells, you can see the colors, you can hear theirs whispers etc.. once you've read the book, you look back and see the power of friendship over the power of status. A very nice read."
2,Very Heavy-Handed,"It was a very, very heavy-handed story/writing style. Rather than showing us through the story, the author chose to use a very heavy writing with melodramatic languages to make her point. While I have no doubt that life in those times was very hard for the women in society, we don't need such over-the-top emotionalism to understand that. Give your readers some credit!"
4,Cute Book,Lisa See makes the book real with so much of the Chinese culture. In Snow Flower and the Secret Fan we follow two little girls on their journey to adulthood. The lessons that are learned about friendship and responsibility will help us to look at life in a whole new light. READ THIS BOOK!
5,sister friend,"This story about a remarkable friendship between two girls was very powerful and loving. I think if we are lucky, we too can have a ""laotong"" or as I would call them, ""soul sisters"". I have recommended this book to all my friends and will suggest it for my two book clubs. Too bad that women no longer have a secret written language! I look forward to more of this type of reading."
4,"Beautiful, sad story","A definite education into the lives of Chinese women who experienced foot binding. I found See's descriptions to be vivid and sometimes too much to bear. The primary story of the two women and their love/jealousy relationship is the core of the novel, albeit entwined in their relationships with their mothers.I recommend it for anyone who wishes to learn more about what Chinese women have suffered at the hands of their mothers, while reading about the trials of a young friendship."
3,What a plot twist...,I've seen so many great reviews on this book and decided to read it. I was a bit disappointed and had expected more. I loved Shanghai Girls and thought this book would be a book I couldn't put down. It has a very slow start to it but then I guess it's necessary to build up to event. I enjoyed the book but wished the beginning wasn't so slow...overall 7 outta 10 score wise (if I can put a book down continuously then it didn't truly capture my interest and I wasn't able to do that w/this book until nearing the end).
2,Left Cold,"I found ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan `to be lacking in human emotions. There were many areas in the story that I wanted more compassion from Lilly. She was cold even during the most emotional times in her life. I finished reading this book last night. I will take the advice of some of the other reviewers and move on to Pearl Buck's novels that are set in Ancient China."
5,Tender and Heart-Wrenching - A Lovely Story!,"A tender, heart-wrenching story of the love between two friends in 19th century China. Ms. See shares a wealth of information about the lifestyle of Chinese women in a style that is easy to read and engrossing. The reader truly cares about these women - their pain and joys and strengths and weaknesses.The story is a study of contrasts and the ending will have the reader contemplating how they wish to reflect on their own life. Such a lovely story, but a caution: if you cry easily, be certain you have tissues handy!"
4,Unforgetable Story,"Lisa See's Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a wonderful story that offers an opportunity to learn about a different culture. In rural 19th century China women's friendships lasted a lifetime. Husband and wife were usually not friends. Women created their own society and there were rules to obey. Lily, the narrator of the book, looks back on her 80 years. She tells of the foot binding and how difficult it was and how it changed a girl's life. Lily and Snow Flower become lifelong sworn friends at an early age, but their paths differ and and it causes both some heartbreak."
3,Comparison to Pearl S. Buck seems inevitible,"Unlike many other reviewers, I really had to struggle to stay interested in this book. I did recieve an excellent lesson on Chinese culture, especially the barbaric practice of footbinding; but felt I was waiting for something to happen with these characters. I felt that the author was simply reporting on a series of facts and there was very little story development. Also, If found it interesting that practically none of the male characters were referred to by name. Is this Ms. See's sly way of getting a dig in at the male-dominated Chinese society of old? Talk about reverse sexism! A much more entertaining alternative for readers who were left wanting more, is Imperial Woman by Pearl S. Buck."
2,May be I was expecting something different...,"I had very high expectations from this book but unfortunately I was very disappointed. The story is narrated by the main character in the novel after she becomes an older woman. This poses difficulties for the author of the book to allow the narrator of the story to empathize with the readers. Thus, the reader often finds the narrator and the other characters distant and unemotional. On the other hand the readers are presented very detailed information about how it would feel to have to go through foot binding. The author also provides information about nu shu, the secret written language of Chinese women."
2,~just a gal,I felt the author was not able to capture the delicate restraint inherent to chinese culture. I did not really enjoy this book.
1,Unimpressed,"I have to agree almost verbatim with Tatjana Kazan's review (second from top). Based on the book jacket's premise, which prompted my purchase, I expected a lot more than See was able to deliver. The historical aspects of the novel were interesting enough to keep me reading, but the plot was loosely woven and the characters uninspiring. Many times it seemed the author had simply taken an emotionally challenging episode from her own life and written a story around it. The syntax was at times so distracting and poorly executed that I actually reread sentences to make sure they hadn't been misprinted. It all made for a very distracting read; I honestly don't understand how this book merits so many positive reviews. This is my first experience with Lisa See's work, and it will be my last."
5,Book Review,I really enjoyed this book. It was a great example of historical fiction by being entertaining as well as educational. I learned a lot about Chinese history and the lives of Chinese women that I hadn't previously known. The characters are well developed and the plot keeps you reading. I recommend this book.
4,Great Historical Novel,"I love historical novels where I learn about another culture and time. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan was heart wrenching. It's a wonderful story of female friendship, betrayal and how one navigates in a restrictive cultural system. My book group loved it."
1,HUGE disappointment!!!,"After reading other reviews I was very excited to choose this as the first book for our book club this year. My first sign that something was wrong was when the author contradicted herself 3 pages into the novel. It just went down hill from there. The contradictions continued and the characters were one dimensional and not thought out. The story line kept me reading the book but not the poetry I was promised. This is a don't bother book.Perhaps Amy Tan's excellent book, ""The Kitchen God's Wife"" ruined me for cheap knock off's."
5,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"I couldn't wait to read this book every night. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is one the the most beautifully written books I have ever read. When I read the last sentence, closed it for the last time, I was saddened. I wanted the story to continue so I could continue having a part of Lily's life. Lisa See transported me to China everyday for about 8 days. I will never forget the story."
3,"good story, but hard to read.","This was a selection of our book club, and not my usually type of book. The story was really good and I enjoyed it, but it was difficult to read. I am not sure if it was all the foreign names or the way it was written (or a combination), but I ended up borrowing an audio book of this and enjoyed it much more and finished the book that way, instead of in print."
3,snow flower and the secret fan,I'm always looking for new authors. I like the way Lisa See writes and I am fasinated with the Far East.
4,A bond between two girls,"My dear friend moved away a few weeks ago and emailed me to suggest that I read this book with her. Every few days we compared thoughts and feelings about the book via text or email. As I read, I was moved by the strength and bond that the Chinese girls shared, their shared suffering and the challenges that everyday life brought. Every few chapters I felt I needed to let it simmer a bit so that I could adequately process the story and the message the author wished to convey. How unfortunate to be born female during this time period. It was sad but there is definitely a clear message in the book that is rewarding and fulfilling.Snow Flower and the Secret Fan: A Novel"
4,Fantastic Read,"This is a compelling story of the strength of women, friendship and love. It was so easy to get engrossed in this story and then I did not want to put it down. One of the best I have read this year."
4,Recommended,"After reading this novel, I am already looking into other stories by this author. She is quite talented and the rhythm of the story seems to echo the time period about which she writes. There is obviously a lot of underlying historical research, as well as first hand knowledge of landscapes and structures, but the author's skill does not let the story suffer by overkill in relaying excessive details. Instead, I find this story exceptional at depicting human frailties and faults. Interesting twists keep the pages turning, and leaves the reader thoughtful as to how everyone can become victims of their own pride and misplaced values. This book was recommended to me by my own best friend (laotong) of over 25 years and I would suggest it to other ""sames"" to share and enjoy!"
5,Really good book!,This book takes you to another world and makes you want to stay there. One of my favorites. Perfect for anyone who likes books that take place in another country and those who like to get a glimpse into lives unlike their own.
3,Snow Flower and The Secret Fan,A well written and horribly sad story about the suffering of chinese women. I could not put it down. But I was so depressed during and after reading it that I will never read another Lisa See novel of fiction.
4,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"This is not like your typical Asian book about women in the Chinese culture. The character depht and the easy way of wrinting makes this book an different kind of ""page-turner"". Any woman can relate to the different kinds of love described: filial, motherly, spouse and friendship. Even when reading about a culture that remote from the Western Modern world, Lisa See makes it easy to relate to the women in the book and makes one draw parallels to your own life.Good reading also for a Book Club as it enables a smooth discussion and triggers some passionate views."
4,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"I thought this book was very informative as to the life and habits of the Chinese around the turn of the 20th century. Relationships have changed little since that time, people are always misunderstanding situations. It was beautifully described and written."
4,good purchase,this book came on a recommendation and it was a good book and i'm glad that the price was cheap
5,"So beautifully written, it brought tears to my eyes","Amazing; bravo! A must read for anyone who has any interest in love, compassion and friendship. Truly astounding."
5,Beautiful story!,"Not to be redundant with all the other positive reviews, but simply put, this was a beautiful story of two women -- raised together as ""same sisters"" and the tale of their trials, tribulations, joy and happy moments as they go through life in mid 1800s China. The historical information about the culture, customs (especially the details about foot binding), language, etc were wonderfully woven throughout the book. You will think about this book and these two fictional woman long after you have turned the last page. Highly recommend!"
3,An Okay Read,"The first book I read by Lisa See was Peony in Love. I truly loved that book. I bouth this one in hopes that it too would captivate me like Peony in Love did, but no such luck. I was bit bored half way through the book... It wasn't a bad read, but it just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,Not much of an original,"Too many repetitions, not enough of an original plot line, not very interesting"
3,Not a page turner,"Interesting to learn about women in China in the 19th century and the whole foot binding tradition, but if I weren't trying to finish it for a book club, I don't know whether I would have kept at it. I didn't find either of the leading female characters very compelling."
2,Boring,"Reading this book was like watching paint dry. I don't think it's well written and the characters aren't compelling enough to even want to continue. A better alternative would be ""Memoirs of a Geisha."""
2,Would have been great - w/o lesbian scenes,I'm sorry that yet again an author feels compelled to include sexual intimacy alongside emotional intimacy. Actually denigrates the millions of close female friendships with healthy boundaries. So sad.
5,awesome book,"This is an awesome book. I just recently read ""The little Chinese Seamstress"" and this reminded me of how I was apprehensive to read that book, and was so impressed with the book that I had to pass it on and rave about how great it was. I also learned so much about Chinese culture and history from reading this book."
5,"Wonderful, you won't want to put it down","This is a fabulous book of the culture, traditions and life for Chinese women and how a friendship was able to endure through life's triumphs and tragedies."
4,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,I could not put this book down. I loved the way the author made me understand the reason for each tradition in the book including foot binding.
4,Strength and Love,"I loved this book. It is a well written story about friendship, set in rural China in the nineteenth century. Lily is now in her eighties and is narrating the story of her life. She is paired with her laotong or ""old same"", Snow Flowers, who is to be her lifelong friend. The bond of love between them is more heartfelt and stronger than any of their other relationships. Their bliss, their pain and their heartbreak is at the heart of the novel.It was also interesting to read about the foot binding which took place then. While it seems so bizarre and foreign to us I cannot help compare it with the strange things we now do, as women, to beautify ourselves, i.e. botox, collagen injections, etc. It all seems to involve some type of pain to ourselves.I loved how this book took us to another place and time. A truly beautiful story that will surely move you long after you finish the last page."
3,Pearl Buck-like,"The story style is much like ""Peony"" by Pearl Buck, although there is no morality associated. There is nothing highly enlightening in terms of Chinese family structural history. It may be of interest to those who are interested in examining cultural factors that inhibit active feminism."
4,Very Enlightening,"I found the story to be sad, but very interesting at the same time. As I read the story I found myself wanting to learn more about what Chinese women went through during those years. It is very intersting."
5,Misunderstandings,A great story...Full of suprisesThis book even had me looking up on the internet to see what binded feet really looked like. It was that interesting. The story of the friendship between Lily and Snow Flower was moving.I totally fell for the sisterhood part and felt so terrible about doubting Snow flowers love for Lily. I admit I cried. The ending was redeeming. Many turns and suprises....
5,Wonderful learning experinece,This book opened my eyes to an entire new world and one I have trouble comprehending could ever have existed. It is well written and there were moments I had to put the book down just to absorb the depth of the story. I loved the book!
5,Book Club favorite,Questions were not a problem as we compared the cultural differences and yet similarities to today's family life. Questions at end of book were a bonus. All agreed that it was probably our best choice for the year.Illinois Book Club
4,Enjoyable book,"Rich in detail and exquisitely crafted, this is an excellent book which I highly recommend, though some parts are rather graphic (footbinding) and are not for the weak of heart. I can honestly say that I am glad that I didn't have to go through the footbinding process! I felt so bad for the younger sister, and though I understand the reasoning behind this in ancient China, it still horrifies me that these parents would do that to their daughters knowing the risks associated with footbinding, especially Mom and her own mangled feet.Some people complained about the nu-shu writing, and while I am not a scholar of China and therefore cannot say if it was accurate or not, this book is good as a novel, and does teach you a few things about Chinese society and how things were back then for women."
3,"Interesting, but a little slow",Very interesting to get a glimpse of Chinese life in the 1800s - footbinding and family customs. A little slow at times with a good ending.
5,Hugh Jackman,They're making this into a movie. Whose character does Hugh Jackman play?I thought the story was about two Chinese women in China. Is there a white man in the book too?
2,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"Lisa See has a good story here with lots of cultural information, especially in the area of foot-binding. Her writing, though, has much to be desired. She lacks the eloquence that other writers in this genre have mastered. The audio book version of this book is very annoying as it displays an over abundance of insincere sounding drama in the narrator's deliverance."
2,All that research shows--far too much,"It's obvious the author did a lot of research & used it as the shaky framework on which to build a very flimsy plot. It's poorly written as well; the foreshadowing couldn't be clumsier, the descriptions are cliche-ridden, the characters are mostly stick figures, & the character development is non-existent--Lily's change of heart at the end is the exception that proves the rule. My book group's opinions were split, but we did have a very good discussion about women's roles in different cultures & how culture--including our own--controls people's lives. If it weren't for that, I'd have given the book one star."
1,tortured abroad,"yet I as lad I had to read this blokey book for english class for english 28 at first like anyone else excited to read it to know all the fuss but within the minute I started to read the book I fell asleeep nearly on every chapter the only part I found interesting was the nu shu languang and footbing facts otherwise its a not a virile book rather more feminine talking about shoes,marriage,arrangement,and other boring issues only girls can relate to ovearall the most boring book to suck up a four page essay on."
5,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,Excellent book. Learned so much about the culture and felt all the emotions of the characters. Will look for more of her writings.
3,Flimsy characters float in and out without explanation,"This was a good book, but I don't think I'll crack it open again. The story didn't captivate me and I was pretty disappointing by abrupt changes that left you wondering ""why?""Characters were very two dimensional and death and loss were treated as though they were a shrug of the shoulders.Wish I could have loved it, but I didn't."
5,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,This is one of those books I hated to see come to an end. The story moved right along from beginning to end. Characters were strong and storyline very clear. This author ranks right alongside of Amy Tan!
4,An engrossing book,"I appreciated that this book kept my attention the whole way through. I also liked the commentary, which gave a little more insight into the author's creative process, at the end of this book. I think the writing style and voice of the narrator are consistent with one that would come from an Asian culture."
2,Was expecting more,"I bought this book on a whim without reading any reviews and found it disappointing. I'm really surprised about the rave reviews here. I kept reading hoping that the story would get better, but I found it to be pretty predictable and didn't get much closure at the end. I also felt that the narrative was super simplistic. At one point, I thought to myself ""Wait, is this for adults or was this written for middle school aged students?"". I felt like I kept reading over and over again ""I want Snow Flower to love me"", ""Being a daughter is hard"", ""The life of a woman is sad"", etc. No real depth or imagery, just a lot of dry repetitive narrative. Maybe I just don't like or appreciate this author's style, but I would not recommend this book."
5,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,An excellent story of friendship and forgiveness. It also includes the most graphic description of Chinese foot-binding that I have ever read.
2,Boring,"Didn't much care for this book. Found it boring and tedious. Other than the chapter of foot binding, this one put me to sleep. I know I'm in the minority, because all the women at work loved it. Oh well..."
2,I hated it,"I wanted to like this book. It seemed like I would like this book, but I didn't like it at all. I put it down halfway through and didn't even finish it. I wasn't crazy about it early on, but then when something awful happened to one of the 2 main characters and I DIDN'T CARE, I knew I was finished with this book.Although I did find fascinating the whole foot-binding tradition and how Chinese women lived then, I was very disappointed in the story."
4,Accurate perspective?,"I read these types of books looking to learn how things were at a different time and place than what I know. To that point, I think it was a great book.I know this isn't a true story, but it reads like it could be and I enjoy that. However, there were a few times that I felt she ""slipped up"" and didn't give an accurate account of how someone from that time period might describe things. For example, at one point she tells how she walked through the door into a house and how people didn't knock on doors. Well if no one knocks on doors, why bring it up? She's comparing something that she shouldn't know about. There were several other times the author would do this and it would unfortunately remind me that this is being told by someone who did not live this experience, so that ruined it for me a lot of times. Otherwise, I enjoyed the story."
5,Opened my eyes,This book was narrated by a fictional 80+ chinese woman who told a sad story about her lifelong female companion and the secret writings of nu shu on a fan. It is beautifully written and I couldn't put it down. Give me more of Lisa See!
5,One of my favorite authors,Had to get this book. I ready all of Lisa See's books and this one is the last to add to my collection. Can't wait to read this one.
3,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan: A novel,"All during the first half of the book I wondered just where it was going. Then in the second half of the book I became more interested in it. I guess I felt that it was too repetative in the beginning. When finished, I had a better feeling for the book."
3,Entertaining,I quite enjoyed reading this novel. I was surprised knowinig about the terribly hard life Chinese women led in those times . It is written with sensibility
4,A Literary Soap Opera,"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a very engrossing story about two women growing up in rural China during the days of the emperors. I'm not sure how factual the descriptions of Chinese culture in this book are, but even if there is only some truth to them, they made me glad that I didn't grow up as a peasant in imperial China.The story moves along quickly for most of the book, following the lives of two women from age seven all the way to the point in time that their grandchildren are nearing adulthood.(Spoiler Alert) The plot of this book reminded me a bit of a ""Lifetime"" movie or a soap opera in that everything from drug addiction to physical abuse and exile to a refugee camp plagued these women. There's nothing that didn't happen to these gals over the courseLike a soap opera, this book hooked me and didn't let go. I wish that it had ended differently, maybe in a less melodramatic way, but the ending fit the trajectory of the story."
5,Snow Flower/Secret Fan,"This helps explains the complicated Chinese cultural. Iwas impressed at the close bonding of the women in thestory, and appalled at the harsh restrictions imposedupon them--foot binding being only one of them."
3,"worth reading, yet falls flat","I had just finished reading The Red Tent and was hungry for another book dealing with historical fiction from a woman's perspective, preferably with women being isolated from men. This book does have that element but lacks much of the depth that Diamant's book provides. To See's credit, the book does stay with you, but it loses its intesity after the laotong girls enter womanhood. The women become two unlikeable characters, highly depressing and even in conflict, very little actually occurs. I wish I could be more specific, but I don't want to give anything away. There were just simply places where the book fell flat, but it is a nice light read. Don't expect much peace after reading, though."
5,One of my favorites,"This book is defintely on my list as a favorite. It was a great story and I never wanted it to end. It was so rich in culture and I learned alot about chinese culture. Give this book a try, you will not be sorry!"
3,Almost 4 stars,"Almost 4 stars for the exceptional period detail and amount of historical research done by Ms. See in preparation for writing about women's lives in China several hundred years ago. Would have been a five-star novel had the story included narration from the other ""old-same"" friend Snow Flower. I found myself constantly wondering what Snow Flower was thinking and her interpretation of the events shaping their lives. A more in-depth exploration of the physical relationship between the women (briefly hinted) and how that shaped their connection would also have strengthened the novel, and explained Lily's actions at the close of the book. Unfortunately both characters were rather two-dimensional."
4,Snow Flower blossoms!,"We read this novel as a book group selection. Though it has several painful moments, both in the story line and in the descripton of women's lives in China during that time, it was a big hit with the group. We had one of the most animated discussions ever."
4,Good historical outlook; strong women book,"Great for women of all ages to read. Would be a good book for a mother/daughter book club. It has a feel of "" Red Tent"". You get an insight of women, their customs, in another time and a different culture.It is nicely written. An easy and interesting read.Would recommend it."
1,A Horrible Explanation of C,"This was the required text for my Intro to C course at my university. Let me just say, if you already know C you will understand this stuff, but if you want to learn C for the first time, GOOD LUCK! It took me forever to learn how to use a structure, and have been scared for life with pointers. Good thing I found other books on C that took the time to explain just what the point of each example was and why I was doing it. GOOD LUCK IF YOU GET THIS BOOK, YOU WILL NEED IT!"
1,The very worst C book ever,"This book is nearly useless to anyone trying to learn C. All 16 students in my C class were unanimous in our dislike of this book. It may be OK if you already are trained in programming C, but it was confusing and caused the sales of other books to go up as we searched for a good manual on C."
2,Not worth it!,"I was required to get this book for a programming class I am taking and all it did was make me more confused.If you are going to buy a book buy ""The C progamming Language"" by Kernighan and Ritchie - it's a better book to learn from and more concise, straight to the point.It will actually teach you C in under 200 pages, which this book fails to do with twice as many pages."
4,digital timer,"This timer works very well. The good feature is when the timer goes off it counts up therefore you know how much time has lapsed since timer went off. Easy to set,easy to read. Wish timer beeped louder. Nice looking."
3,"good functionality, weak design","This has just the features I wanted in a kitchen timer, including digit buttons, but it has three major flaws:* The buttons are extremely small. There's plenty of room on this unit for larger buttons, but for no good reason they made tiny buttons that are hard to press.* The beep is extremely shrill, with no adjustment possible.* The screen is surprisingly poor contrast/poor quality LCD, and it's easy for the digits to get lost in the glare.This said, it does keep time, the magnet is adequately strong, and I'm glad they at least tried to have digit buttons."
2,alarm NOT loud,I needed a timer with a loud alarm. This wasn't it! The buttons were a little awkward to use also. Not an improvement over my very old one. Returned it and will try something else.
3,Functions well. Just don't drop it.,"I'd prefer that the product was slightly larger, but it works well enough. I did drop it by accident once and had to replace a cracked piezo speaker.The alarm is adequately loud and high-pitched.The magnetic material on the back is not strong enough to fasten it securely against magnetic surfaces."
2,Great timer. . . . as long as it lasts,Loved it for 9 months; now it's stopped working. Expected more for the price! Now I'll be seeing how their warranty is.
2,Oversized display not so oversized.,"The display on this timer was no larger then the display on a timer I had purchased for $9. The buttons are smaller then on other timers I've looked at, and at$19.99 it definitely isn't worth the price."
4,great alarm except for tiny buttons,"Once you've used a digital timer with direct entry you'll never want to go back to a model where you push and hold buttons while the time advances. This model has a feature many competitors don't; if you count down a time period you can bring the starting count back and do it again. This is very handy when you're doing a repetitive task like flipping a steak on the grill every few minutes.I'd give this model 5 stars if it had bigger buttons. Competitors like the Westbend get much better sized buttons into a smaller body. But the Westbend doesn't have the repeat time feature, so if you want that then this is the model to get, otherwise get the Westbend."
3,Setting up timer,It is very hard to set the time on this timer. I am very handy with things and i can read directions very well. I have not been able to set this timer correctly There is no need to have military time on a kitchen timer. Otherwise this product looks OK
1,wasted money,"I made the mistake of purchasing a series of 7 DVDs of Winkelman's katas. I have seen these katas performed better by yellow and orange belts. These disks are a total waste of money if you are looking for something to really show you proper form. they are fine as a refresher to remind you of the proper order of techniques, but nothing more than that. To see a supposed master walk through a kata rather than display proper form is shameful. Seiuchin kata performed without bent knees, some stance changes pivoted around a stationary leg instead of stepping through, Naihanchi kata walked through with back turned to attacker at times... too many mistakes to even list.my qualification? ni-kyu, many years of doing these katas with a 7th dan who insists on perfection."
5,Brilliant Book,This book is a great reference for any ichthyologists or anyone who loves fishes and art. It contains a lot of information and citations for each species.
1,Poor Product,"I did buy this product 'used' however, the description of it was that it was in perfect condition and almost like new. When I received the book, it had writing in it, the cover was bent and the colors were even faded out. The pages were bent was well. The book looked obviously old. I understand that I did purchase a used item; however, the seller falsified the description."
2,Not Age Appropriate,"There are some good stories in this collection, but I agree with the other reviewer who found it too dark and gruesome. We picked this up for next to nothing at a thrift store so I didn't look at it too carefully initially, but when I finally thumbed through all the pages, it was clear from the illustrations alone that the theme tended toward weird creatures. What was even more disturbing was that there wasn't always a moral to correct the bad behavior, as in the story of the pet bear who ate an entire family. It was just morbid, albeit in a silly kind of way."
1,Horrible and scary,"This is a horrible children's book. It has stories about cutting off a dogs head and other scary animals. Our four year old son was really upset by these stories. (I think we only read three of them) He asked us to throw the ""scary book"" away so the trash men would take it !!!!!"
3,Sort of good,"The case looks cool. The belt clip works great, small and functional. Padding is allright. But the material breaks easy, cracks and starts scratching your face from the first day. This is not a soft sided case! I liked the version with the neoprene better (although they seem to not make it with this belt clip anymore - too bad), but this looks nicer."
5,The great protector,This is my everyday protection for my cell phone. It offers great protection for it because I throw my phone in my purse along with all the other things women tend to carry. There's not a scratch anywhere. Plus it provides extra padding in the event you drop your phone.
5,Georgia Singer/Songwriter Creates Awe-Inspiring Album,"Those who are astute enough to have perked up at the songwriting gems offered by David Barbe's previous bands (Sugar, Buzz Hungry, Mercyland, and Burger Chief) are now being rewarded for being good listeners by the release of his new, brilliant CD. Here is a consummate songcrafter and arranger with ten of his best new songs which were, as rumor has it, produced over the course of three years.The approaches and styles of the songs are varied and only a broad category such as ""rock"" really fits. Here is balance and patience and rare, rare talent. How about those traits as attention-grabbers in today's music world? Not as easy as yelling/whining or pouting/stripping, but most of those ""performers"" out there who borrow their antics from angry toddlers don't have a ""Comet of the Season"" to their credit.File it under ""rock"" or ""alternative country"" or whatever, but do file an order for it. Music that will sound just as good 30 years from now."
1,Mediocrity...every day,"Oh my...what a waste of talent we have here. This could have been an emotional, compelling drama about the strains a family undergoes with life changes (sexuality, growing older, the decline and loss of an adult parent), instead it's just curiously colorless and blah. If this had been a well-done movie, instead of a mediocre melodrama, it would have had rises and falls of angst, heartbreak and would have posed serious questions about morality and love. But EVERYDAY simply coasted along, flatlining when it should have held our interest, and, in the end, I felt like, ""so what?""This is 93 minutes of my life I wish I could get back."
2,Depressing and disjointed,"As a big fan of Helen Hunt, I had high hopes for this movie. The general plot - a typical modern-day family juggling the pressures and challenges of everyday life, while adding a cranky grandfather riddled with health problems to the mix - also sounded promising. But overall, the movie was just plain depressing, and certainly didn't qualify as having any ""comedy,"" as the DVD jacket claimed. Despite being family members under one roof, everyone from the spouses to the two teen sons seemed to be living separate lives that didn't connect with one another at all, which is often true to life; but in a movie, their stories should intertwine somehow, and they really just didn't. Ultimately, I made it about 40 minutes into the movie and turned it off; I just didn't see a point to wasting my time for another hour."
1,phony,"I was expecting to get a regular U.S. Navy hat as is worn by our valiant sailors and that is what the advertising suggested. Instead, I got a cheap peace of junk that is useless. If you are looking for the real thing you are wasting your time with this hat, not to mention your money."
4,A serviceable costume prop,This year I dressed up as Shipwreck (from GI Joe) from Halloween and this sailor's cap did the trick perfectly and the sizing information made sure the hat fit my larger than average head.
3,Warning to other parents:,"There are 28 songs on this particular CD. While most of them are really cute and funny, like the peanut song, there are a few of them that seem totally inappropriate for younger kids, particularly the one about the yellow cat. That one is all about trying to (unsuccessfully) get rid of the cat. It's a very long song, but the two parts that shocked me the most were the boy trying to drown the cat who ended up drowning himself instead, and the farmer who tried to shoot the cat (with explosives involved) - they found the man in pieces. Seriously?On another note, the enhanced CD is supposed to have lyrics available as printable PDF files, but mine had only audio files on it. I ended up having to type out all the lyrics but that was probably just an error on this particular CD.That being said, I am planning on buying the whole set and editing out the inappropriate songs, as the rest are worth it for the giggles they get."
1,The Infinite Monkeys.,"This music is possibly the worst example of a British attempt at being American I have ever heard. Surely this can only be the result of an infinite amount of monkeys with instruments but unfortunately there are faces behind this racket. At first glance they do look like monkeys but then that's the Brits for you. No seriously I'm not just being nasty but, please, don't waste your money on this mix of poor Nirvana meets Guns 'n' Roses played badly."
2,"Slim, but function and style aren't great","The Ion's slim case allows me to fit my phone in a small storage place in my dashboard where other cases are just too bulky. But the case's good looks are marred by a tacky metal BodyGlove logo (smaller than a dime, but thicker) stuck to the side. It makes an unwanted fashion statement, and the metal logo scratches anything painted it comes in contact with. I carefully pried the logo off and the two small holes it leaves are an improvement over the original look.I also think the belt clip positions the phone too high, which makes it uncomfortable to wear when sitting.If you need a slim case, this may be the best choice, but the cheesy logo and the bad clip position makes this a disappointing purchase."
5,Excellent Article,"David Nicholson is one of the nation's leading authorities on combining media with effective classroom instructional strategies. His clever and witty delivery combined with his theoretical knowledge of this important topic with assist classroom teachers with the integration of media into their classroom repertoire. As an educator, I highly recommend that you read Nicholson's article."
1,Too Wordy,"In our graduate level course, we were forced to use this terrible book. The committee, for some reason, approved this book even if the professors dislike it. The book problems are very wordy and the book does not contain all the information to complete the problem. After much outcry of my classmates, our professor decided to drop the book. We now use our professor's notes and problems.Please choose another graduate level textbook."
2,Too many print omissions,"The book has too many printing omissions. For example, 'thermodynamics' reads 'the mod nam s' at many places and so on."
1,Not suitable for engineering students.,"This book was required for my MSME applied thermodynamics course. I was very disappointed by the layout, style of writing and even the content of this book! As an example, chapter 1 deals with the First Law of thermodynamics. It takes 45 pages to state 1 equation...the rest being useless information such as Poincarré's lesson at the University of Paris.Every single student in class with me wished they had not bought this book. I would recommend for engineering students, ""Fundamentals of engineering Thermodynamics"" by Moran and Shapiro"
4,Arizona petticoats,"I have just discovered this book, at a time when I am considering a holiday in the south west of North America. It is so interesting to find out something of the history and character of a region, beforehand. I greatly enjoyed these very readable and well researched short biographies of Arizona women. Their diverse circumstances and achievements are fascinating. The old photos are great, too. Arizona must be quite a place. Thank you, Ms Brown."
1,Less than half the amount!!,"I was more than disappointed to say the least to discover that I only received 59 caps instead of 120 caps, I most definitely won't be purchasing this from Amazon again."
3,"Nice boot, toes run narrow.","Nice work boot, toes are more narrow then most big name steel toed boots though, be ready to size up. Seller was good with return policy but it gets expensive to ship them back and forth to find the correct size."
3,Seen to be good boots,"I needed off the clock work boots for doing stuff around the house. I wear size 11.5EEEE shoes and boots usually. Had a very hard time finding that in a safety toe good looking boot for everyday use under $250. The way I understand shoes E is normal. EE is wide, EEE is extra wide, and EEEE is extra extra wide. In the past I have worn a 12EEE to get that fourth E in width and been fine. With these boots my toes are a bit crammed, especially the 2 smallest on each foot. I am not sure I would were these all day every day, but they are a great boot otherwise so I am wearing them for a few hours at a time for now."
5,Great boots.,"I've purchased this boots for a construction job in Alabama. from the first day, it was very comfortable and cool. I'd very much recommend this boots it you are working in a hot environment."
1,they fall apart fast!,"I bought a pair of these wolverine boots in july of 2012. By november they had completely fallen apart. Since they were the most comfortable steel toed boot I had ever owned, and I'm required to wear steel toes at work, I ordered an identical pair in mid november 2012. That was a huge mistake. It is Jan 24, 2013 and the new pair is starting to rip apart. Granted I wear them 45 to 50 hours a week, but a pair of steel toe boots should last longer than a few monthes. Although the comfort is amazing, if you're looking for any sort of durability, don't order these."
2,Not good,Thay started falling apart after 2 months. I'm not happy with the boots nnn nnn nnn n vv vv vv
5,Great boots,"I purchased these boots to replace my previous pair of Wolverine Steel-Toed hikers. Like my prior pair, these are light-weight and quite comfortable. I work in the oil field and these boots are constantly exposed to water, mud, and chemicals and my first pair lasted 3 years, compared to the other name brand boots I bought to replace them that last less than a year. Well made and resist pretty much everything I put them through. I would highly recommend these boot to anyone that works where steel-toed boots are required, but are comfortable enough to wear for everyday."
5,Story about a time of prejudice and how people change.,Reginald's father is the manager of a baseball team in the Negro league. Reginald would rather play his violin than anything else. His dad signs him up to be a bat boy. Reginald plays his violin for the team which starts them on a winning streak. Shows insight into world of music impact and Negro ball players.
2,Good but...,"If your collection needs some virtuoso elevator music that soothes nerves, this is a worthy CD. BUT almost everything on it is the mono version of the recording...all of which were re-recorded later in Stereo. I don't recall reading that this was a mono recording before purchase and since the stereo versions exist, e.g. the 2 stars.Mantovani is Mantovani. Reviewing the CD as music is pointless since the arrangements are a known quantity. But stars are about a recording that is mono and ought to be stereo."
2,Just Three Old Albums,"The ""Box Set"" is just basically three old albums of Alejandro Sanz: ""Viviendo de Prisa"", ""3"" and ""Más"".So if you already have them do not bother with this ""Box set"" because it offers nothing new."
4,Sip with Moe,"This CD is definitely off the chain, it's everything I have come to expect from the Houston rap scene and then some. I highly recommend your purchasing this album, especially if you are into laid back party tracks that let you cut loose without feeling all sugarcoated. This is the real deal, Houston at it's finest. If you have this, I also suggest Lil' Flip, Botany Boys, HAWK, and Lil' Keke's CDs too!"
5,Excellent!,"I have been doing yoga in my home for 4 years. I have many yoga DVDs, books, and CDs. I have DVDs which teach the Iyengar style of yoga as well as one of Iyengar's books. My sister purchased this DVD and shared it with me. I was not expecting anything great. However, I was VERY PLEASED. This DVD is the BEST one I have seen for teaching Iyengar style yoga in a systematic and easily understood manner! I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to understand proper alignment and form for the basic yoga asanas as well as how to most effectively use props. It is especially beneficial for those who do not have access to a certified Iyengar Yoga teacher."
2,Too Heavy,"I purchased this snow boot for my 4 year old daughter. It is a nice looking boot, my daughter loved it. It also keep warm with the insulation. However, she is having hard time to walk even on a flat surface. I noticed the boot is to heavy."
2,Sound quality sucks,"It performs as advertised except for the sound quality. You would think, with today's technology, they could produce a better sounding machine."
4,best one yet,this is the best answering machine i have owned yet. i love how it announces callers so i don't have to jump up to check the caller id anymore.
2,Andy from Chicago,"I've had this unit for about two years. I worked fairly well for about 15 months. Now it has degraded to a worthless piece of plastic. As noted in another review here, the sound quality is very poor (AT&T should be embarrassed). I guess this is a production quality problem as not everyone seems to have this issue and mine was fine until it suddenly stopped working properly. Also, the unit records every hangup even with no message, which can make listening to the messages a bit tedious."
1,This is just horrible,"I bought this machine only 2 months and the recorded voice become totally messed up, but the annoncement still working. I cannot believe such a bad product bearing the AT&T; name on it.The price make me feel not worth to call them, but I still want other people know my story."
4,AT&T 1738 review,The AT&T 1738 works as advertised. It is a good low-cost answering machine. We have no problems with voice quality.
2,Bad sound quality,"I liked the simplicity of the unit and was what I was looking for, BUT the sound quality is so horrible I hate it. This goes for both incoming and outgoing messages. And the more I re-recorded my outgoing message in order to ""get it right"" the worse the message sounded.It is way too pricey for what you get.Can't anyone make a decent, simple answering machine?I cannot find one anywhere."
1,Garbage,"1) TERRIBLE sound quality.2) After time entry, it lists ""Tuesday, four twenty six, twenty ten"" - - that's it - nothing else available - useless for date stamp.3) A call to tech support reveals no support available because the unit was manufactured sometime in the middle ages.4) Avoid this one - it's not Amazon's fault, but it's a ripoff even at such a bargain price."
5,AT&T 1738 digital answering machine,"Does a good job and functions flawlessly . If this one lasts as well as the previous one , it'll out live me ."
2,AT&T digital answering machine,"I purchased two AT&T; portable phones which are great so far. But this answering machine is not a simple machine to set up. It also lacked the 2 connections in the back I need to connect the machine, so it didn't work. However, setting the clock, options is a real pain.I will return the item and use my old 16 year old GE 90s answering machine that does the job just as well."
1,bad machine,i have never recevived a order that was bad would not work i will never order from these people again. i threw it in the thrashe.e can . i have been ordering from amazon for a long time never run into a seller like this one never order from them.elizabeth phillips
1,Through with AT&T after many years,"We've had an AT&T machine in our offices for many years. After having been through three 1738's we are switching brands. When accessing remotely, we do not get messages that are there on the machine when returning to the office. Extremely unreliable and counterintuitive compared to excellent past AT&T units. What's going on, AT&T?"
5,Hard to find at local stores,"A simple ""stand alone"" telephone answering machine is hard to find. I called a few box stores and was told ""we do not carry such a product anymore."" Our business telephone system has an answering feature, but I do not want to use the business system. The ATT1738 is simple to install and set up. Great product at a friendly price."
1,Sound quality went to crap,"I bought one of these and within a year, you couldn't tell what anyone was saying as half the words were garbled. The outgoing message still worked fine, so I kept it and used it as an announcement to call my cell. If I'd needed it to take messages, it would have gone in the trash"
2,"garbled incoming messages, broke after 2 years","The quality of the outgoing message was good, but the incoming messages had poor quality. I often had to listen to messages several times. Messages coming from cell phones were usually impossible to decipher. The extra background noise added to the already poor sound quality just turned the messages to complete garble. Today, after two years, it just stopped answering. I turned it off, to see if I could reset it. It would not turn back on again. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. The lights came back on, but I don't know whether it is going to accept messages again.The buttons and settings were easy to use, so this was a plus."
5,at&t digital answering machine,I have found this is an excellent little answering machine.The setup was a snap and the default voice for answering is pleasent and seems to encourage callers to leave messages and with 40 minutes of space they seem to wanna leave a whole lot. I found this to be a great value at the price.
5,AT&T Answer Machine,"The machine works just fine. The sound quality is very good and the volume can be set high enough so calls can be screened from another room.The written instructions for setting the time and day and other features are confusing. Instruction #2 should say ""Press and hold SETUP until the system announces the feature you want to set, then release."""
5,A COMBO!,"it got a lot of features with godd quality. very Clear Voice/ Great sound. I mean it is so darn easy to set up.even I could do it. when you press a botton it prompts and directs you on how to manipulate a feature.the instructional manual is a plus! Remote access & prompts date,time,yr ,phone number. this one is a keeper."
2,Needs voice quality improvements,"Overall the AT&T; 1738 answering machine has good functional qualities. However, the prompt voice is a little insulting in that it talks to you like you have never touched a piece of electronics in your life and will never understand the technology.As for the voice quality, I was going to replace my 15+ year old Code-A-Phone tape-based machine with my new AT&T; machine until I heard the announce voice quality from the new device. It sounded as if you were trying to talk through a pillow! Needless to say, my old Code-A-Phone machine will be seeing a lot more service until I can find a solid-state machine with voice quality worthy of my use.For some reason, the transition from the earlier Lucent machines (I also have a Lucent A560 with excellent voice quality) to the more recent AT&T; machines has caused a degadation in the voice quality. It probably has something to do with profits."
4,STOP! Try this first,"I was very disappointed with this product initially because the incoming AND outgoing sound was so poor. It was basically useless. While searching for a different answering machine, I read a review by someone who thought of placing a DSL filter on the same phone line as the answering machine. I tried this and the machine works very well. The sound is good. This is a good value for someone who only need one mailbox."
4,"Really good plot, almost like a mystery","This is one of the best Star Trek Original Series episodes ever. Kirk is put on trial for an action that could have caused a big mistake on the Enterprise. I haven't seen this show in a long time, so I don't remember what the accident was. However, the admiral that puts Kirk on trial doesn't believe it was accidental, and they go aboard the ship for the answer. Then it gets really frightening, and it's too much to say. But I can say that you shouldn't miss this one, because like every reviewer says, it's one of the best. Enjoy!!!"
3,Good book for newbies and people looking for direction,"I bought this book for my brother who is a new webmaster. I read it before giving it to him and though I didn't get any enlightenment from it (I have been promoting websites for several years), it has become a very useful guide for my brother. If you are just starting a website and need an easy and direct list of things to do to promote your website, this is a good starting book. If you however own multiple sites and are looking for new ideas, this book is not for you."
3,Not for everyone,"As an overview for the true novice, this book is full of good, basic, up-to-date ideas. However, this book is defintely not for every business with an online presence - and doesn't say that. The author never clearly states that by using the term ""small business"" throughout the book, she's actually referring specifically to e-tailers and those providing services to consumers. Most of the tips and suggestions would not be useful or practical if you're a consultant or use the web to promote other business-to-business types of products and services. For that, I'm disappointed."
5,Skinz Novel,"Kool...should be a movie...by Robert Rodriguez....if he has the balls for it....""Bad Bitch Films""...On You Tube....if you dare...PG rated....wow....Peta should love it...and the rest of the civilized world...BOO.."
5,WOW,"SkinzAnimals have been hunted andkilled for thousands of years.They were part of God's food chain and kept everyone alive.For the last 100 years, furs have become charmingly fashionable,and now, animals are skinned,for just their furs.Their bloody remains, their bodies, left to rot.Now it's their turn, to repay mankind........and they're pissed!!This Novel will send you over the Edge of Reality.Nothing Like it AnyWhere!!!"
2,Pass If You're Looking for Another Incarnation of New Order,"Ok, so I'm a big New Order fan and have all of their later catalog, as well as members' various side projects (Revenge, Electronic, Monaco), all of which I enjoy and have a pretty consistent sound and quality across the collection. Then, in the interest of completing my collection, I order this title. Granted, taste is subjective, but if you are buying this thinking you are adding to your collection of New Order/New Order-esque titles, you will probably be disappointed. My primary beef with it is that neither the overall quality of songwriting nor the quality of Gillian's vocal work is up to the standards of the New Order catalog, or the other side project albums. Specifically, the songs are mostly lacking in melody and depth of structure, and the vocals are thin. Then again, I'm not sure any female vocalist would ""fit"" the expectation of a New Order sound. I would pass if that is your expectation for this disc."
3,"Half good pop music, half mediocre filler","This album has some very good songs; the melodic synthesizers on the wonderful ""Selfish"" are irresistably catchy, and ""Tasty Fish"" and ""Movin' On"" are also quite good. Gilbert and Morris only had half an album's worth of songs though; there's a lot of filler late in the CD, pointless instrumental tracks that hardly pass as songs. If you listen til the end, at least you'll be rewarded with ""Loved it"", which is a pretty good piece of filler. New Order/Electronic/Monaco fans should get it, at least for the good stuff. It has an unusual combination of all synthesizers except for real drums. Worth it if you can find it used."
3,Not New Order- and that's okay...,"Reading some other reviews on here, ""if there was only Peter Hook's bass or Sumner's singing"" ...Well then, it would be a New Order album at that point. ???? The Other Two is exactly what you get. Different, yes. A good thing? For several songs yes, but there's a lot of filler here folks. Buying this in '93, I played the first two songs over and over, and then fast forwarded to 'Innocence' (to skip the filler). Buy it used for a few bucks, it's more than worth it."
2,DUO FALLS SHORT OF NEW ORDER.,"This CD starts off so strong with ""Tasty Fish"", ""The Greatest Thing"", and ""Selfish"" you think at first why were these two ever with New Order, until the 4th song ""Movin' On"" appears, than the 5th song, the 6th song, etc., goes way down hill from there, and you know why this duo hasn't made a new album since this debut effort, because they put all there eggs in 3 songs. The CD is worth the 3 songs if you get it at a EP price, otherwise if you have to pay full price for this puppy, forget it."
2,Insipid,"Where are the beats? It's mostly grooves & mellow house. I feel it's boring and content-less. There are 2 songs I like- Via Nova & Mundo Unio- but they aren't really strong compared to other ""latino"" music I have."
4,Looks great but not all of it.,Every inch of this thing is really awesome. However when they say battle worn they aren't kidding. There will be dings in the wood and paint imperfections. Also the strips of metal at the top and bottom are very low quality and are held in by thumb tacks. There is also a chance the metal wont even be the right size and bow out away from the wood thus pushing out some of the thumb tacks. Its nothing like the provided picture. but you can simple pull all the tacks out and replace the two bits of metal with better quality on your own time then it looks perfect.
4,great decor,"This shield is noce as a decoration it seems sturdy with the exception of the faux metal trim which is thumb tacked to the rest of the shield. i woudn't recomend using it in Larp. strictly for decorations, but it does look real."
1,Broke on first use....,just junk.... poor craftmanship...Complete and utter piece of junk... cheap parts used and dont hold together.. well at all... not worth the effort
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,THIS FELL APART RIGHT OUT OF THE PACKAGE AND DOESN'T WORK AT ALL..I WANTED SOMETHING I COULD USE MYSELF TO SHARPEN MY KITCHEN KNIFE AND IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY!!
1,not worth your money,This thing is a terrible buy do not spend your money on it it falls a part instantly and do not sharpen anything
2,economy back-up winch handle,"This winch handle was inexpensive, but it is very difficult to remove from both of my Lewmar 16 self-tailing winches. No matter what you do with the locking mechanism, it just doesn't seem to release."
3,This is not the original album Ekseption 5!,"This is only a hit compilation, not the original album ""Ekseption 5"" as I expected. The true title is ""Ekseption the 5th""! I hope there will be the true Album ""Ekseption 5"" in the future!"
4,Does seem to be working,"We have a very bad mouse problem in all our cars. Nothing has worked. They love nesting under the hood and in the glove box, which I find terribly gross. Finally, we seem to be mouse free. I use Mouse Away weekly and have found no new droppings under the hood or anywhere inside the car. I put a couple of drops under the hood, a cotton ball with a few drops in the glove box, another cotton ball under the seat and one more in the truck. Smells great."
1,Mouse Away Concentrate,"Absolutely useless! Cleaned all drawers w/soap, rinsed & dried thoroughly, then saturated drawers & crevices w/this & let dry. Smelled very good & odor stays for months, but mice also attracted by the odor - a few days later drawers were loaded w/mice droppings & some thin plastic bags & paper were shredded to bits. If anyone WANTS to attract mice to come in their house, this will certainly do it!"
3,mouse away concentrate,written on the bottle it states 60% peppermint and 40% spearmint oil. I think it is dilluted as when buying the oils seperately and mixing them it is a more potent mixture.
2,Don't work,"I used it, I saw the mouse ran right over it just it was not there. I put some more concentrate on it , still did'nt work."
3,Mice packed up and left.,I think this stuff really works. Put it in and around a couple collector cars and when I returned to check on it there were little footprints leading away from the garage. The Watch Cat looked as though she hadn't eaten in a few days. Pretty potent but not unpleasant aroma.Now I need to find a similar product to keep the rats away from my favorite pub!
4,Part of my ammo...,"...in my war on varmints, a long running battle that I'll never win but... These, along with the mouse away solids packs are an easy way to place scent bags around the house and vehicles. We all cannot just pick-and-choose or wars, so we must fight them any way we can..."
1,"Drove us away, but not the mouse!","I ordered the blocks and also the oil. Put blocks and oil everywhere and the smell of it was so strong our eyes were watering! We could hardly take it the first night, but the mouse had no problem. He came out and pooped all over just like the night before:) Now i'm just wondering how long it will take the smell to die down in the house."
3,"Works well, smells good, but need to spray often","This product has nice but strong smell. Seems to be effective while providing nice odor. However, need to apply often."
3,Mouse Away Concentrate,It probably worked. I not linger have a need for this product and it was a long time ago that I used it.
1,Doesn't work.,I bought this for our basement and the mice don't seem to be bothered with it at all. It smells nice and is nontoxic so that is why I wanted to try it.
2,"I love the smell, but apparently the mice do too.",I didn't find it to repel mice. I put it down in places where I had seen droppings and a few days later the droppings appeared again.
2,Smells Great but Questionable that It Works,"Ordered this in a last ditch effort to keep mice away from my kitchen instead of trapping/killing them. The first night I put this out (used on original Mouse Away solid packs) I caught a mouse in a snap trap right next to it. So, it didn't repel. Continued catching mice for the next 4 nights-probably the same family? Since then, I've left the Solid Mouse Away packs out and haven't seen a mouse. Perhaps it's repelling new families of mice? We've gone all out though using a terribly smelly garlic spray outside of our home, glue traps in the garage and crawl space plus snap traps in the kitchen above the garage. I'm continuing to keep the Mouse Away around b/c I feel it smells good and is safer than anything else I could use with kids around. May be worth it depending on what you're trying to repel. But if you're looking for a sure-fire ... this isn't it."
3,Seems to work?,"Hey at least it smells good. I got it because of bats living in the garage, I also got an ultrasonic thing that's supposed to chase them away at the same time, there's no bats in there now but I'm not sure whether it was this stuff, the ultrasonic thing or the combo that did the trick."
3,Bochepus Box Set CD's,"The item is an excellent collection of Hank Williams Jr's songs. However, the particular set I purchased came missing one of the 3 CD's to the set. I would have liked to know this prior to the purchase. So, I paid for what I believed to be the complete set of 3 CD's & I only got 2 of them with a note inside the package that 1 of the CD's was missing."
1,Mediocre product and poor support,"This product does not work well with mice through a serial adapter. I attempted to contact their tech support by e-mail for a possible resolution to this issue, but have not recieved a response at all. This product comes with a PS/2 to serial adapter, but it is not until you read the user manual (ftp://ftp.linksys.com/pdf/kvm.pdf) that you find that mice which switch between PS/2 and Serial emulation are not supported.This is the second LinkSys switch I purchased and the second I had problems with. The first, a PS/2 only model, I couldn't use with my laptop because it only had one PS/2 port. LinkSys advertises this product as a solution for laptop users, however I feel the ad is erroneous given the product doesn't work well with serial emulation, and most laptops can only support a single PS/2 device, which you must use for the keyboard."
3,Defective KVM cable...,"I would have given this item a 5 but I received a defective KVM cable. After purchasing another KVM cable from a local computer store and attaching it to the switch box, the system is performing well as expected. I like the easy feature of switching PCs by a simple keyboard touch. Not to mention, I purchased the item on sale... If you have 1 AT model PC and PS/2 PC, the Linksys KVM100SK ProConnect is the way to go."
5,faultless,"nice little box. performed faultlessly the four or five years it was connected to my two ugly beige boxes. switched between windows and linux without failure. unobtrusive. what more could you ask?epilogue: got rid of the two ugly beige boxes and retired this gadget, but still give it full points."
1,BEWARE! Fragile plastic pieces inside powerhead!,"Gun worked fine until a plastic sleeve cracked inside the powerhead. (I ran the gun at 70psi, this was not due to an over pressure situation) I called Stanley Bostich and they said that ONLY o-ring and bumper kits are available for order. The warranty for this tool is only 90 days. What I have is an ugly doorstop. Who warrants pneumatic tools for 90 days when other companies warrant for 2, 3, 5 and 7 years. I'm very frustrated with this experience and will no longer be a buyer of Stanley tools."
4,Good Little Gun,"I bought this as a back-up nailer because Amazon had it priced so cheap. It's lightweight, and fires and sets finish nails perfectly well. It's not as heavy duty as others, and I wouldn't think this gun would last very long in job-site conditions, but for a woodworking shop that needs a light duty gun, it's perfect."
4,Great Nailer!,These guys from Stanley Bostitch are great...a fully featured nailer for under $120....I couldn't be happier. Amazon has the best deals.
1,Defective Product,I had a Stanley brad nailer that quit working so I ordered a new one. This nailer did not work right out of the box. Think twice beforebuying this product.
4,Great overview,This is a great book that covers all of the basics about using non kiln fired glass paints. A must read book for the hobbiest and a good place to start fot those serious about adding color to their clear glass art.
1,Historical done lightly,Seemed to lack much depth.....found myself skipping ahead. Not up to usual standards. Regretfully suspect I would not recommend this.
2,The Magnificent Rogue,"I assure all of you that I am the biggest fan of Iris Johansen. Ive read most of her books and her Wind Dancer Series is my ultimate favourite. But this book was so.. disapointing. It fell flat throughout. It didnt have a moment of sizzle in it. The historical intrigue involving Elizabeth seemed like it was put in as an afterthought. Comparitively, Storm Winds was such a deep and profound book. Johansen seems to have her swings. I really hope my next book from her would be better."
5,I was almost sad when I finished this!,"This book profoundly touched me with its colorful, 3-dimensional characters, patient character and plot development, and of course the love story. I often read books where I find plot holes and ridiculous dialogue scattered throughout. But there was none of that here, and I truly found myself wanting to know these people and watch the story go on and on! Its pretty crazy when words on a page can stir the imagination to that degree, but this book is the best one I can recall having read in many years. And the chemistry between the hero and heroine was incredible!"
5,MAGNIFICENT ROGUE,I LOVE THIS AUTHOR AND READ EVERYTHING SHE WRITES. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD BOOK. i WILL PURCHASE HER NEXT BOOK SHE PUTS OUT AND ALL THAT FOLLOWS.
5,cant go wrong,"icouldnt find a better price anywhere. it took about 10 minutes to change both of them. they work flawlessely every time,i couldnt be any happier with my purchase. a great product at a great price."
5,Just as good as the original...,"I tried the strut from Stabilus first because it is more readily available over the internet, but it didn't last a week on my Jeep Cherokee. That item's ball & socket joint is pretty weak and it gave out. The Strong Arm is really more secure and works a lot better than the Stabilus. If you can find the Strong Arm (it was difficult to find), it is a much better product."
1,Not right size,"Was not even close to the right size for my 2000 Grand Cherokee.. Maybe need more description when ordering. Shipping speed was good, unfortunately didn't help solve the problem."
5,Great lift supports.,Bought these lift supports to replace the OEM lift supports on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee. The old lift supports would not keep the rear hatch up during cold weather. Installation was very easy. Open the hatch and have someone hold it up while you work. Remove the bottom of the lift support (ball) first by using a small screwdriver to remove the clip holding it on. Unscrew the top of the lift support (two screws) and remove. Put the new lift support on in reverse order. Top first then the bottom. Repeat on the other side. So far these lift supports work perfectly and I had forgotten what it was like to have working lift supports.
4,Gets the Job Done,"I drive a 2000 Cherokee Sport and years of wear and tear have taken their toll on my rear hatch struts. The original struts no longer supported the door so I went looking for cheap replacements.That is what this product is, a solid, inexpensive replacement. I decided to give these a try and they arrived much quicker than I anticipated. They were easy to install and they work great. My only issue with them is that they tend to force the door open a little quickly, something the original struts never did, even when new. But I shouldn't complain, it's a great replacement and you can't beat the price. I would recommend these to anyone."
5,Great and easy Product,"The lift gates worked perfectly and were easy to install but you need another person to assist you since the lift gate is heavy. And important advise: don't ask your wife to help, that's the only mistake I made in this whole process. A big plus, choose the free shipping Amazon offers, I received my product within five days.Overall, very happy with my purchase!!"
1,VERY disappointed,"I'm an accomplished quilter and belong to a bag of the month class consisting of 18 people. We have made 7 bags from this book and all but 1 have major problems with the directions, i.e. wrong measurements, etc. The quilt shop owner contacted the author who blamed the publisher. I would not recommend this book nor will I ever buy another book from this author."
3,I love purses,This is not a book for beginners. The instructions are for experienced quilters or sewers. I love all the ideas and I am going to try to make each bag. I bought this book without reading the reviews or else I might have had second thoughts on purchasing this book.
5,Excellent to home in on perfection,"Creating a perfect pilsner can be the most fustrating undertaking in home brewing. To acheive crisp, clean, properly hopped pilsner lager, a guide is needed. This book is that guide. It will teach you the history of the style, and give recipes for some of the most famous beers from Europe. My favorite is Pilsner Urquell. Be forewarned though, it does not teach decoction mashing, which is the traditional way to mash in your grain for Pilsner. Only NEW BREWING LAGER BEER will guide you through the triple or double decoction mash required to hit the bulleye on great pilsner taste. This book is a great addition for your collection though, and will greatly aid you in the developement of great Pilsner lager. Don't forget to use the softest water you can get your hands on!"
4,A great resource for the Beginning All Grain Brewer,"This is one of my favorite of the classic Beer Styles Series. It is one of the shortest and Most concise, Miller doesn't go into a lot of history and obsecure style disscussion here, nor does he get too technical. What he does do is present the basics, and he does it all in a non-threating, easy to read style. This is a great resource for Pilsner Fans"
1,Worked for about 10 minutes :(,"I purchased this for my 10 yr old son. I was surprised at how, well, cheap it appeared. We took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first, then it worked for about 10 minutes, then it never worked again and we had to return it. Amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly. We ended up buying the DGX 5.1 MP from a local store i it's place. It has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth. Not a professional photography instrument, but a pretty decent unit for him."
5,Gadget of the future,"I went through the effort of writing a lengthy review on this camera, but apparently this site can't ensure the comments get posted, or won't bother to post it. It's a great camera -- way better than the previous models which are quite good. I give the camera 5 stars, and this site 3 stars. Doubt I will bother writing a review again. -- annoyed"
4,Terrific Value-Excellent Qualiy Photos,"This little digital camera, video/audio recorder, MP3 player is a compact, lightweight piece of equipment to take on trips or any type of traveling. It's value makes it expendable should you lose it;it get stolen or damaged in transit. I was amazed at the quality of the voice recording I took while on a tour bus in Jamaica of the tour guide telling a joke. The only thing I miss on this Aiptek model is the extra video recording light that was on an earlier version."
5,GREAT!,"Excellent product for the price. Pictures are not that good, but you can't ask more for this price."
1,Okay digital camera.... poor digital camcorder,"Intially I was excited the day I received this, however that soon faded. I tested only the digital camera and the camcorder. The camcorder function remained grainy no matter what I tried to correct it... this grain was disfiguring to the subject I was recording. It picks up light poorly aswell and the flash just didn't work. Distorted color.... The camera photos turned out nice... but once again without a flash it was hardly worth what I paid. Microphone also barely picked up sound. Difficult to handle, even with my small hands it was a challenge. I'm in the process of returning mine."
4,Great little gadget,"If you're a gadget person, you'll love this. If you're looking to film the next ""Titanic"", don't buy it. It's great fun, easy to use but it is not an $800 camcorder. I suggest rechargeable batteries though, it goes through the regular pretty quick -- especially if you play with it as much as I do. The video can be dark indoors so turn on the lights!!"
2,"Great Camera, Poor Construction","I purchased 3 of these for christmas presents for the 3 teenagers in my home. The cameras were very well received. The kids LOVED them and recorded and took photos of everything under the sun! They had a B-L-A-S-T with these! However, before a year was up, the door that holds the batteries in the camera broke on every single one of them (I purchased 3 -- that's over $300 down the tubes), even on the ""mild child"". Too bad the construction wasn't better :o/"
4,Not Bad... You can work around the biggest drawbacks.,"I too bought this $88 camera at Target, and have been mostly pleased. Outdoor movies look great, indoor flash stuff is fine. Indoor movies are pretty dark, but I found you can fix that by 1-turning on all the lights in the room and 2-pointing the cam at the light source for a few seconds to set the white balance. That seems to work most of the time.A pretty good first movie cam, though you can find much cheaper versions ($59, even a pen-sized movie cam for $15 at aiptek.com) that might do much the same thing."
3,ok... camera you get what you pay for...,"I'm a kid, i wanted a digital camera 4ever but i had to save up the money i saw the aiptek 3500 which i wanted so i bought that it worked great! then the dv 4500 came out so i returned the 3500 and got the 4500 the worst mistake ive ever made. the dv 4500. worked for about three months then the lens broke off i taped it up then it worked 4 about another 2 weeks . then out of the blue the power button broke you can stick a pencil in the spot of the hole if you want to get it to work.then the battery cover broke off... it does not work the sales people dont help you at all.. i would not RECOMEND getting this cameraa kid ..."
1,don't buy yet -- USB problems,As of this date (June 2004) the Windows XP USB drivers (updated version 1.1 from the Aiptek web site) for this camera seem troublesome. The Aiptek web site does not offer useful troubleshooting for this relatively new model as of yet. Do not buy this newly released camera at this point.
1,No bargain at any price,"I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were ""acceptable,"" at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain."
3,It was OK I suspected better....,This camera is pretty good. The M PEG 4 files are false!! It's in only AVI. Theyre lying. Which means the movies are low. The camera taking pictures were impressive. My thing that sucks the most is that the LCD is poor. When it is dark outside or their is low lighting you can see crap. SO how can you tell if the camera is in the right aim?!!? I mean it doesnt make sense. THe software that comes with it SUCKS!!! I prefer Windows Movie Maker 2.1 And plus if you want to record movies and resave from editing software make sure you get a IEEE345 CORD it connects the DV to the computer. I think the pictures are awesome but the filiming sucks so far. But Iv'e made prety good movies with it so far. I suggest getting a camera for those adults. Teenagers like me will love it. And I do. Only downside is the LCD screen and the frames......
2,Not worth it.,"I was really dissatisfied with the DV4500. It's really only a 2mp camera, even with that, pictures came out grainy and distorted. Mp3 playback was lousy- mine only played back out of one side. The flash never worked properly, pictures were always too bright, and it ate up batteries like nothing. And rechargables didn't have enough juice to fire the flash more than once. To top it all off, the screen stopped working within 90 days of purchase, and is currently in for repair. It was ridiculous, but mine was an early unit. Nonetheless, I would not buy this again."
4,Where's my 4 megapixel camera?,"I ordered this camera from this site and it does everything I expected it to do except I found out that this camera is only a 3.1 megapixel camera even though it says 4 on the box and instructions. In the digital camera mode you only have the options of 1, 2, and 3.1 megapixels. I'm still pretty mad at how Aiptek lied, but I'm getting over it. So if anyone can get their DV4500 to take a picture in 2300x1800(4mp)instead of 2000x1500(3.1mp)please say it in your review. Besides that problem this is a great camera and will be alot of fun, but get some rechargeable batteries first."
3,"lots of features, below average quality",<br />I returned the Aiptek camera after 3 weeks. This camera does loaded with a lot of features but none of them works well. <br />Camera: outdoor photos ok but indoor photo is too dark even with the flash. <br />Camcorder: MPEG4 movie is disappointing even at 640x480. Indoor movie is too dark. <br />MP3 player: you cannot FF to the next song while playing. You have to stop and then FF. Very annoying.<br />Audio recorder: works fine.<br />Webcam: Same problem as camera/camcorder mode. Too dark. The lens of this camera is too small.<br />
1,Extremely poor quality,"This is the worst camera I have ever used. I wasn't expecting much at all, but I got nothing. The first thing you should do after purchasing this product is to test the ""voice recorder."" I like to call it the ""noise producer."" You cannot understand the playback for the recording you just made. You hear mumbling against static. Try out the flash when taking a photo. It has to charge first; that's just like a one time use camera.<br /><br />When you're satisfied with those two features, the next one for testing is the video camera. Wait. It has a video camera? I couldn't tell. I thought the video it was producing was something called the ""blur effect."" Everything captured by the video recorder was unintelligible.<br /><br />Please do not spend money on this. It's not even worthy as a kid's toy. Buy them a VideoNow or a Barbie cam."
5,Aiptek DV4500,"I currently own an Aiptek DV2 that records in .AVI format and still photos at up to 2.0mp. This new camera records to MPEG-4 and stills at 4.0mp. I find the overall camera to be great, with great photos. However, I don't much care for the software that comes with it, I would recomend a good full version of Pinnacle Studio 8 that can work with .ASF/.WMV files."
3,Had to buy for school,It was like any other school book required. Book itself was in good shape. I wouldn't have bought it for leisure reading though.
4,Exact,This book which I purchased was in the exact condition that was mentioned. It is in great condition to use for my class being that it is not a brand new book. I am satisfied and I am using it effectively in my class! :-)
2,Informative,"Informative, but very longwinded. He's managed to make an interesting subject very difficult to follow. Seems very conscious not to influence the readers judgement in any way, but the affect of this is ruined by the limited number of european sources available to him.Its hard to follow the plot when you've not been allowed to get to know any of the characters."
2,Cumbersome,"I expected to be able to just set a phone in the cradle in order to charge it.You have to plug the cable that sticks out of the cradle in the phone's port to do that.The USB and charging cables are permanently attached to the base which makes this weird looking thing take much more space on a desk than it should, with the cables being constantly in your way."
2,Lacks depth and Specificity,I found very little that added to my existing knowledge of quindeciles. Far too much canned text and too many examples of famous people's charts without enough insightful information. Nothing about house placements and very little about how the quindecile expresses through a given planet in a given sign....left to use standard astrology for sign and house placements giving just a surface knowledge to apply when interpreting the planetary aspect. The quindecile planet and sign combinations I have in my chart were barely mentioned...disappointed.
1,Excess baggage,"Miss Reeve's book is written well enough--at the knee of mentor and Svengali, Noel Tyl. However, in astrological terms and usage, the information here is next to useless, and something of a joke in the astrological community. The book attempts to raise a minor aspect into the majors, and it simply won't wash. It's a puff piece for Tyl in a way, and really, astrological students would be so much better off reading the works of John Frawley and other cutting edge astrologers. Kudos to Reeves for getting the piece published (by Tyl's publisher) but it's best used as a coaster or doorstop."
1,Real bad first experience,"I chose this camera as a reward for 25 years with my company. ARGH, I've all kinds of trouble with the battery and power indicator. The first batteries lasted about 5 shots. The ones that came with the camera lasted longer. About the 3rd shot with the original batteries the camera battery light was flashing red. I flipped the battery door open ripped the batteries out, put them back in and it said 2/3 strength again. Last night I had 2/3 of a battery, tried to take a shot and it just died. The screen went black, the lense was still extended and that was it. I've gone through about 4 sets of batteries in 45 shots. I used to shoot with an SLR and know what I'm doing but I can't seem to get a clear picture even holding extremely steady. This was my first digital and I'm looking to replace it soon. I've already spent $100 on a SD card and AC adapter for this thing too.Picture quality - YUK.Battery life - a joke."
1,"Whatever You Do, Avoid This Steaming Pile Of Poo","I just recieved this camera less than 24 hours ago and it has already bit the dust. After the batteries slowly died this morning, I replaced them and took a picture. About 5 seconds later the LCD display went black and the camera turned off. After several attempts at reviving it, I pronounced it dead and was looking forward to returning it for a better quality camera. I am hoping to get my money back and buy a Panasonic Lumix Digital Camera since it seems to take great pictures and was given great reviews. As soon as the Minolta camera died I came to Amazon.com to look up reviews and I laughed as I saw the 1 star ratings and horror stories of other customers. At least im not alone. Whatever you do, do not buy this digital camera."
4,mountainredneck,"This camera was purchased for my wife to have with her all the time. She is a basic novice, and she has gotten very good pictures with this little piece of technology. She uses it as intended, and does'nt expect miracles. It has all of the functions that she needs, fits her hand to a tee, and drives me nuts printing pic's. For your spouse or children who want to enjoy digital photography and have fun doing it, this is a good way to go."
3,Needs lithium batteries,"I deleted my earlier review of this camera where I gave it a 1 star because it won't power on whenever I changed the batteries. After changing to lithium batteries, it was OK. The camera itself is not bad. It's easy to use (except in low light) and prints out beautiful pictures. It's just very picky with batteries. Since this camera is no longer being produced, you are on your own if you have problems."
2,Try Something Else,"This overall, is not a really great camera. You can probably find a better value for your money elsewhere. I just wanted something to take out to the bars and get pictures with my friends, and it was always a hassle getting it to actually take the picture. No matter what setting (night was the worst), you need to hold the button down for 2-5 seconds before it flashes. Everyone would end up breaking their smile by the time it took. Also, not it's fault, but I didn't realize it took AA batteries; it wasn't a Lithium Ion battery. If the camera was NOT EVEN ON, it would drain the batteries. It would literally drain the batteries within a day if they were in the camera, no matter if it was on or off. I did a workaround by placing one battery in the wrong way. As you can imagine, going to the bars and constantly flipping one battery was not my ideal camera."
5,Great little camera!,"I can't believe there are so many negative reviews about this camera. I've had mine for three years, and I love it."
1,Not Today's World,"The Business Policy Game is copyrighted 1995 and contains a computer disk for the simulated game that is still in DOS. It is totally out of date. It teaches students to run a company in a business world that no longer exists. It offers no opportunity for innovation, entrepreneurship or e-commerce. This game may have been useful for students in 1995 but it is no longer a simulation of the world that faces us in 2002.Dona McDermottAssistant ProfessorMBA Candidate"
4,"Started slow, but finished well","'Enigma' is a story of intrigue that takes place at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. There are two main storylines: cracking the enigma code before a shipping convoy is destroyed, and discovering the motives and intentions of the mysterious Claire Romilly.Both these storylines revolve around the main character, Tom Jericho, a cryptanalyst working on breaking the german naval enigma code.'Enigma' starts off very slowly, and after 90 pages, I was about to put the book down and move on. However, Harris really starts getting to the heart of the action about this time, and the book really takes off. Perhaps he could have condensed the first 90 pages and made this book five stars, but taken as a whole 'Enigma' is quite entertaining.If you enjoy books about wartime codebreaking, you will definitely want to read this book. If you read and enjoy 'Enigma', you should check out Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptonomicon.'"
4,Another good one from Harris,"Once again, Robert Harris's skilful blending of fiction and history has produced another page-turner. ""Enigma"" is a powerful thriller, packed with suspense and plot-twists. It's also a very vibrant portrait of war-time Britain, with the black-out, food rationing and all those stiff upper lips. The characters are believable and the whole book pays a wonderful tribute to all those unknown men and women who helped win the war."
3,Don't expect another FATHERLAND,"After all the hype about this book I was a tad disappointed. It's not bad, but definitely doesn't compare to his first book. So if you haven't read Fatherland, wait with this."
3,Don't expect another FATHERLAND,"After all the hype about this book I was a tad disappointed. It's not bad, but definitely doesn't compare to his first book. So if you haven't read Fatherland, read that."
4,Well written but a bit slow,"This book was a nice easy read. It was very well written but rather slow in parts and the ending was rather disappointing. It didn't have the depth of characters or the exciting back drop of Fatherland, also by Harris. But all in all worth the time."
5,Extremely Enjoyable Read!,Don't let the technical aspects of cryptology throw you off. This is an extremely interesting yarn! Throws a great deal of light on what had been a obscure subject. The ending is totally unexpected. Enjoy!
4,"Intriguing, intreseting - I could not leave it...","I think this is a most interesting subject, and Harris really covers it very well, using a well built story with great attraction power. I could not leave the book all night, until I finished it!!!"
4,Good plot weaving different facts into one story,"You're never quite certain who are the good guys and bad guys in this yarn. Or rather, with many twists and loyalty tensions, your assumptions will be challenged."
4,Excellent writing,A great book that gives a good insight into the cryptographers life at Bletchley Park and the pressures they faced both proffessional and personal
3,War Codes,Robert Harris has written a detailed history of the decoding of the enigma machine and how it's secrets came to be exposed. In the novel he works in a romance that is itself an enigma.
5,Excellent,"Great book. The haunting atmosphere reminds me of the true master of British suspense, John Le Carre. And this is high praise, indeed.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"
5,A different Spy novel,"Some years ago I read a spy novel where the main characters needed to escape from Nazi Germany with some info on the bad guys they'd stolen. It was very entertaining, but for me kind of silly because I'd just read a book on the British codebreakers, and I knew the information had gotten to the Allies by much more mundane means. Robert Harris turns all of this on it's head and even makes it suspenseful. Enigma is the story, in novel form, of the British codebreaking effort that won WW2, to a large extent anyway, for the Western Allies. Interwoven into the plot is a hunt for a German spy among the codebreakers, and while that story is interesting (and the solution and motive bring out another story less often told) the main focus is a novel version of David Kahn's Seizing the Enigma, with all the suspense of the codebreakers grappling with the Kriegsmarine's codes as the convoys approach the U-boats... It's a very good book."
2,Didn't Hold My Attention,"After reading Imperium, which was an awesome work by Harris, I decided to try Enigma. It just didn't hold my attention. It is a historical novel and gives good information about the war, but I found myself dragging through the read, wishing I was done, so I could move on to something better."
1,Enigma - It's puzzling why anyone thinks it's worth reading,"'Enigma totally gripped me' says the line by The Sunday Times on the front cover of Robert Harris's extremely dull book.All I can say is that it most certainly did NOT 'grip me' - in fact I persevered with it up to over half way through, waiting for something to actually 'grip me'.It just droned on and on and on introducing one tired character after another and I couldn't get interested in the supposed central character, Tom Jericho who was as dull as everyone else.It is pretty awful to get that far into a book and then decide that it is so boring that you have to put it down. I have read 'Archangel' by Robert Harris which I thought was terrific, which was why I decided to buy 'Enigma' but I am afraid it was a dreadful disappointment and I'd particularly like to take issue with that anonymous Sunday Times reviewer who was so 'totally gripped' by it."
2,Too enigmatic,"The beginning of this book is good. It's a bleak time in England, WWII, Germany winning the war and they needed desperately somebody to decode Nazi cryptic messages.Jericho is summoned to help the decoders. Then suddenly there is no difference between Jericho's present and his troubled past.Characters appear suddenly and there's no way to tell if the characters are part of the story or if they belong to Jericho's constant recollection of memories.Maybe I expected something like ""A Beautiful Mind"" (although Russell Crow is not sickly looking at all, in the movie he has some mental issues). Or somebody exceedingly eccentric, finding patterns everywhere: Fibonacci numbers, Penrose tiles, Pascal triangles, and other mathematical phenomena. (There is one mathematical fact mentioned, related to pi.) I wanted to be mesmerized by inscrutable logic and the power of deduction.I gave up after page123."
1,"The real story is fascinating, this is contrived and dull","The true story of the enigma and ultra codes in WWII is fascinating, but in trying to cook up a conventional thriller out of this material Harris creates a slow and thoroughly unconvincing mess. The 'spy' elements of the story are daft and the climax almost embarrassing. If you're taken with this period, read some of the excellent and entertaining histories around."
5,A chilly drizzle of a mystery,"For two nights you have been awake with a cold rain outside and your spouse has not come home since yesterday. You might know how our ""hero"" feels, divided by 9. If the cops are knocking on your door and you think you did it, but you have to finish your presentation or your ad firm is in the toilet, you might know how our ""hero"" feels. Certainly a ""can't put it downer"""
3,Interesting insight into WW2 cryptography,"The story is set around a maverick character who works at the Bletchley cryptography centre during the 2nd world war. It's part history, part mystery. The story had me captivated for most of the book, but had a fairly tame ending"
4,4 1/2 Stars - Fun Album!,"If I ever get to New Orleans, I hope this band is playing! I'd go see them in a heartbeat. Album is fun and easy to groove to. Cajun Party Blues."
5,Great Live CD!!!,"Big Al and the Heavyweights have an energetic and inspiring live show. I just saw them at the Docksider in Erie, PA. and picked up a CD from Big Al. You're going to love the blues harp pieces!"
3,Whose Best Of?,"Modern English are certainly deserving of a decent Best Of, but this one featuring songs from their 4AD years is just one big question mark. The darker, harsher debut MESH AND LACE gets far too much coverage here and their best two albums -- AFTER THE SNOW and RICOCHET DAYS -- are weakly represented. For starters, why on earth someone would omit ""Someone's Calling"" and ""Hands Across the Sea"" is absolutely beyond me -- two of their quintessential songs. I almost get the impression that this one was compiled by a fan of their earlier ""goth"" sound who almost begrudgingly (and smugly?) includes the smash ""I Melt With You"", sandwiched inappropriately between MESH AND LACE material.It would be nice to see material from STOP START (""Ink and Paper"" was a great song) and possibly even PILLOW LIPS included in a truly comprehensive compilation, because this one widely misses the mark by purporting to be a ""Best Of""."
4,This is what Modern English was all about!,"Modern English have always been much more than just ""I Melt With You"". In fact I would put several of these songs on this disc up against it. Will people who simply know them through Valley Girl be put off by the darker more experimental songs like ""Gathering Dust"" or ""Sixteen Days""? Quite possibly, but then they'd really be missing the point of what Modern English were trying to get across. I agree songs like ""Someone's Calling"" or ""Hands Across the Sea"" should have been included, but overall I think this compilation really represents what Modern English were about, and really gets at the sound they were trying to convey. It's also a bonus that they didn't include material from any of the albums after Ricochet Days. The lineup had changed and they lost their direction, though having just seen them live, they seem to be back on track and the new material played was quite good, albeit with only 2 original members."
3,80's new wave,"I like collecting greatest hits/best of cds from bands. This one is okay. I would have chosen different titles in place of others, but that is just my personal taste."
3,Expecting a much bigger truck!,"My son (who is 4) loves to come to Amazon and look at the trucks and tell me which ones to add to his birthday/Christmas lists. This truck was on his birthday list and his aunt bought it for him. My son, his aunt, and myself were all shocked that a $30 truck (from Amazon) was so small! We were expecting a truck at least a good 8"" or 9"" long by 5"" or 6"" high-- very disappointing. Granted, we need to make a habit of reading dimensions, but this is the first time we have run into anything like this with Amazon."
5,Great Garage Door Opener,"I bought this garage door opener to replace a broken Genie H2000C 1/2 HP opener that was present when I purchased my house. The chamberlain 3/4 hp opener came with all necessary parts for an easy replacement of my existing garage door opener.Being someone who is technically and mechanically savvy, I was not worried about installing the opener. The instructions were clear and concise and the install went off without a hitch. I would put the difficulty of installing this unit at a 2/5, which means that I think just about anyone who has a simple understanding of how to use hand tools could accomplish this task.It's been installed for about 3-4 weeks now and I haven't had a single issue so far. It is a very quiet unit compared to the one in our other garage door."
4,Garage door opener,I have an eight foot garage door and ordered and extention also. Everything is working fine as I needed it to in order to get my tractor into the garage. I like the features of this opener like the lights coming on when I come into the garage. The only downside is I had to get extra parts to manufacture the brackets for the opener.
4,"Solid product, good design, good instructions","The product was complete, well packaged, and included comprehensive instructions. It easily opens our relatively heavy door."
5,"Great Unit, Straightforward instructions",Ordered with free shipping and received unit within 3 days. Great instructions and relatively easy installation but I was replacing and existing unit with most of the bracing and wiring in place and I am a fairly competent handyman. It took me about 4 hours including running the wires for the safety sensors. Very quiet operation and looks like a great unit.
5,Great Product,"I purchased this garage door opener @ May 2010 and I was extremelly satisfied with it. It was a little hard to put it together by myself , so I had my brother inlaw help me out since he did his and it became very easy, I definately recomend this product for the $ I paid."
4,Not the quietest opener you can find,"I got it installed professionally and it does the job. I bought a 3/4 hp because I have a double door. The installer told me I didn't need 3/4 hp and could have gone with 1/2 hp with the light doors I had. So, if you have basic light, thin garage doors, go for the 1/2 hp and save a few bucks.It comes with 2 remotes and a keypad, which is handy if you have two cars. The plastic on the sides that cover the lamps are good quality. I say this because my garage light stayed on for 4 hours one day when I forgot to shut the door on my way out. As I pulled in, I was concerned that the plastic would have melted, but it showed no wear at all.I am using 60W lamps instead of the max 100W allowed and one on either side, it is bright enough for my garage.I am only docking one star because it is noisier than I thought it would be. Again, that could be because of my expectations based on the reviews I read and not the product itself."
4,chamberlain door opener,The insallation was not as easy as it could have been. once installed it works very good. I wood give it 4 stars
4,Great Product,Received within an acceptable time frame. Installed by a handyman - took longer than he expected from his experience with installing openers. I am pleased with the quality and the quietness of the unit. Would highly recommend this product.
5,"Not hard to install, quiet and powerful","My Brother and I replaced my old, lousy Genie with the Chamberlain. We did it in about two hours and the Chamberlain has been working flawlessly for about three months now....."
2,60 seconds to install? No way!,"Now I admit it, I am in no way a handyman. All I did to install this thing was attach the rail to the motor. After that major in pain in the neck, I decided to pay someone to install it. It took this professional handyman four or five hours to install. There were pieces missing. The motor was meant for the beams to run in one direction and mine run in the other direction, which required even more parts. However, once you finally get this baby installed, it is very quiet. Unfortunately, that doesn't help too much since I have a loud aluminum garage door."
3,Incompatible Remotes!!,"Installation no problem, works fine, replaced a 10 year old model with stripped gears. BUT, the new opener and remotes are not compatible with existing remotes for my other Chamberlain garage door opener (about 5 years old) and the overhead console remote in my Yukon. Very annoying. Of course, I can buy a converter to adapt the old to the new, but then I will need additional openers also, and still wont work with Yukon remote! Seems like a bit of a racket, unless it was some government intervention in frequency use or something! I notice other door opener companies do not seem to have changed frequency."
5,Just a few tricks installing this,It's a great product and get the 3/4 HP model. Took a little effort to install. There are a few tricks installing this.1. Need more and stronger mounting brackets. I had to buy a few from Home Depot and cut them to fit.2. Need more lag screws to go with the brackets.3. Had to buy an automatic Garage Door Closer from Amazon (Xceltronix)4. Use levels and triangle to make sure things are level and plumb. Wish I had a laser level.
3,Chamberlain PD752D 3/4HP Heavy Duty Chain Drive Garage Door Opener,"I just installed the second opener......the first one worked for a short time while I was adjusting the limits then quit working. I thought it had overheated per the troubleshooting guide but after going through all the possiblities, I concluded that the electronic board must have went bad. When the second opener arrived only a few days after I contacted Amazon (excellent response from them), I installed it with no issues and it's working fine.I had to give the product three out of five stars due to the issue with the first one. Had it not been for that, it would be at least four out of five stars.As for Amazon's sense of urgency in shipping me a second unit, I give them five out five stars......great service.-Brad from Michigan"
5,Ricks,This is got to be the most quiet opener. I had a SEARS Craftsman 3/4 screw drive lasted 5-years this was the loudest opener I have ever owned. The Chamberlain is so quiet you only here the door rollers and this is a 8 x 16 Insulated door.
4,Quite Smooth Operatioan,We replaced our old garage door opener with the Chamberlain 752D. Only reason I downgraded this to 4 stars is that the instructins contain a few minor errors. I calldc Chamberlain and they were a tremendous help. It took 5 hours to install. I consider myself to have above average mechanical skills and tools since I am a former mechanic with a major airline. I read the instructions before starting the install. Th 752D at least 50% quieter than our previous garage door opener. The wall switch has an IR sensor that illuminates the opener light when it senses body heat walking by it. Great when we enter the garage at night since the light automatically turns on. Another bonus is that the opener light is also activated when the garage door is open and somebody walks in the garage. This is a great safety feature so you can see where you are walking and not walking around a dark garage. I strongly recommend this opener.
2,Choose a DIFFERENT product.,"Missing Keypad, the installation was a NIGHTMARE, brackets were missing and didn't fit correctly, the unit itself does function well, just the hardware and such as well as instructions are incorrect. (there is no gray wire) anyway........ worst garage door we have ever installed."
5,Mtv Unplugged,"Para los que nos gusta la musica medio latina, medio gitana y medio pop, alejandro llena todas las espectativas y con este disco nos da a sus fans que lo hemos querido tanto tiempo, nuevas versiones que nos llenan de emoción al oirlas, comprelo que no se arrepiente y seguro las oira y reoira todas una y otra vez."
1,Alejandro Sanz,"I love his voice, but there is only one song in the whole cd that I liked. I should had purchase the single"
5,Las Palabras Del Alma,"It is a lovely task and a real irony (for me) writing a review for cd that i ve owned around 8-9 years. Well, to be more exact the one that I own now is a continuation of at least one other one that i gave away.In any case, my journey with this cd started in Peru in 2002 (feels so long ago) with the 2nd song ""Y Solo Se Ocurre Amarte"" that i heard and saw live on the TV. Since then this song became like my banner for the subsequent stay in Iquitos and I guess for the whole of that little epoch in my life. There just something about that song that keeps holding me - i think its the freedom of flight. Yeh, Alejandro flew on this one. The other ones are really good too..""Que aprendio mi curazoooon"", remember that one? The cd is capped by a flamenco song in a more traditional manner and the singer leaves us with that, sort of pondering the line of emotional transformation, is there really such line? Considering the soul of this album, a question rather irrelevant."
5,lo mejor,"Soy fan de Alejandro Sanz desde SIEMPRE, Este CD es excelente. Las nuevas canciones son tan bellas. Pero lo unico que no me gusto de este CD es que tiene 2 canciones que le cambio la letra, y cuando algo es perfecto no hay razon porque cambiarlo.La Fan Numero Uno de Alejandro SanzAnthoanett D. Sanz"
3,Its not bad............,"My only critism with Alejandro is that he has too many words and it all seems too busy. This of course make singing along with it rather challenging!!! (joking!!)I, like everybody, have all his records and I must say live, he does a very good job. This is a cool album with some great sounds, but his songs just fall short for me. Just not catchy enough, or just too something, that doesnt take him to that extra level - in my opinion anyway. I know there will be one or two who will disagree with me. But hey, its a great album and great sounds all round. Enjoy."
3,"Just OK, no representa el talento y el sonido de Sanz","Aprendiz is a great song, the rest seems a bit repetitive. No es su mejor trabajo, prefiero su sonido normal. No esta mal, pero en mi opinion no es un disco que vas a escuchar con mucha frecuencia. Todas las canciones empiezan a parecer iguales despues de cinco o seis. Compre sus otros discos y deje este proyecto ""unplugged."" Enchufela, Alejandro, y seria posible devolverme mis quince dolares?"
5,A Superb Live Album,"I became an Alejandro Sanz fan earlier this year after hearing him sing with Destiny's Child on the Grammy Awards broadcast in February and I have been hooked ever since. This album is totally beautiful- musically as well as lyrically (eventhough my understanding of Spanish is limited). The most moving track on this album however is ""Y Solo Se Me Ocurre Amarte"" (And the Only Thing I Could Do Was Love You)- a tribute to his newborn daughter. Sanz is someone I wish the English-speaking world was more familiar with. He has so much to offer with his music. I am almost upset that I hadn't heard of him before. I recommend this album to anyone starting out in the ""Sanz Experience"". I look forward to more of his albums in the future."
3,what's with the background singers?,"I bought this cd on a reccommendation from someone else, and I found that I really do like Alejandro's voice and manner of singing and lyricism...it's all chill like and kinda bordering on intellectual. But what the he-- is up with those background singers??? they make me freakin laugh they are so cheesy! if he just got rid of those background singers, alejandro sanz would rock. so basically, this is a cool album, with some great songs on it...but be prepared for some cheesiness you are gonna have to ignore to enjoy it."
5,Fathers and Sons in Rural India,"Written in 1934, The House of Kanooru is a powerful and universal story of family life and conflict in rural India. This book is a translation from its original language (Kannada) and has a genuine Indian (as opposed to Anglo-Indian) sensibility. The House of Kanooru explores the relationships between city and country, spirituality and superstition, men and women, masters and workers, and most importantly fathers and sons. Although many Kannada words (for food, birds,and religous rituals) are left untranslated, context almost always gives a general sense of meaning. The Kannada names of the many characters can be slightly confusing, but again context almost always supplies the key. This is a masterful book and is well worth the challenges it may present. There is also a brief introduction by Girish Karnad, who has made a well-received film version of the book (entitled Kanooru Heggadithi)."
2,Family Reunion,"I purchased this movie for my mom,cause she's a Bette Davis fan. She said, that she was disappointed because the movie was boring."
1,Save your $5...it's not worth it.,"I bought this as a cheap solution for a spare computer. The PC would not recognize the card and the drivers that came with it were useless. If you're just looking for a basic sound card, spend another $10 and get a name-brand card and save yourself the hassle with this one."
1,Was not compatible.,"This sound card (specifically the microphone portion) was not compatible with my computer. Downloaded the newest drivers for Windows 7 64-Bit and it crashed (BSOD) ever time it tried to initialize the microphone. RTM. My advice, spring for something a little nicer. The sound portion did work fine, so if that's all you need..."
4,Works well with Windows 7,"Automatically installed drivers with Windows 7 Ultimate x86. Much louder then my onboard audio. The best thing about this card is it wont disable my onboard audio, so I always have two options for audio/microphone. There is some audio hissing/static due to it being a cheap internal soundcard but you can't really complain at this price.NOTE: Throw away the CD that comes with it, don't even place it near your computer. If your OS doesn't automatically install the driver for you Go to the Sabrent website,click on drivers, scroll down to soundcards, then click the first option, choose your OS,use 7zip or winrar to extract it, double click the setup.exe, install driver, reboot, done."
3,Not So Compatible....,"This sound card was tedious to install on XP and Doesnt work on Windows Vista, go to a local shop and find one of these things in the bins for $2."
2,YOU MUST HAVE AN INTEL PROCESSOR TO USE THIS CARD!,"I bought this card, and Windows wouldn't recognize it at all. Then I realized that this card is only compatible with Intel Processors with ""MMX Instruction Set"". Beware! I have an Athlon, and it wouldn't work."
1,Did'nt work for me,No matter how I configured my sound this card sounded the same that is no legible sound
1,Uh.....not so good,I went hunting for a CHEAP 5.1 Surround Sound PCI Card for an XP Pro machine we have a work.I got exactly that... a CHEAP card...that doesn't even work...causes hardware malfunctions consistently (blue screens of death...eh!).It's only saving grace is: it fit in the trash can REALLY WELL.
1,Bad product; Poor Sabrent Customer Service,"I bought this from Tiger Direct specifically for an old Windows ME PC. It won't install automatically or with software from the CD or Sabrent's website. And Sabrent seemed to respond to only about every other email complaint.The soundcard doesn't come with the instructions indicated on Sabrent's website and Sabrent's suggestions when it did respond to emails were unhelpful.If you look at many other comments on this and on Tiger Direct's website, you will see many others also have problems with this product. It's not worth the trouble.An old soundcard which my father scavenged from a trash bin installed immediately and works just fine."
1,Be Sure to Read the Reviews,"I should have focused on the reviews. Came without instructions. Claims to be Vista compatible. Won't install on my Vista machine with an AMD Athlon processor. Now I read about the many problems, including strong possibility that it requires an Intel processor. No drivers available on Sabrent site. A waste of time and money."
3,Should have said so before buying,This card may be fine but it will not work if you have an AMD processor.
1,Returning this card,"Forgot to read reviews before buying this sound card. When I got this card, I installed it in my PCI slot and my video card in PCI express 16x got toasted. Losing HDMI connection to the big TV, I continued to try out this card with a 19 inch LCD monitor. But as soon as I hooked it up with my new Logitech X-540 5.1 surround card system, more problem came. The color code on this card is all messed up. Other 5.1 has green being front, black being rear and orange being sub/center. But this card doesn't follow the standard color code. It also has confusing labels as SPK1, LINE, MIC, SPK2, SPK3 starting from the game port. Sound comes out from center speaker no matter I plug the rear wire in SPK2 or SPK3. No manual comes with the package. What can I do? I AM RETURNING THIS CARD."
5,Do not be deceived by the photograph,Do not go by the website picture alone. This product has two spaces and the photograph is only showing one. Shop and compare against other sound cards before buying this product.
2,not worth it,does not have the driver needed for its operation. no support from the manufacturer and nothing on the net either
2,No win 8 drivers yet,There aren't any windows 8 drivers for this device yet. So it doesn't really work with windows 8. I contacted Sabrent and they said it wasn't their problem.
2,Meh,"It's just too old now. DVDs don't use this sound formatting anymore. Get something enabled for Dolby 7.1 or higher, that's my recommendation."
5,Nice Sound Card,"This card was easy to install (Windows XP, 32 bit) and has great tone quality when played through even high-end stereo PC Speakers. (Don't know if it would suffice for a full 5.1 digital sound system). The sound managing software is easy to use and allows you to customize the back plugins as you plug a 3.5mm jack into each of them. There is also an elaborate equalizer function and a lot of digital sound enhancements you can utilize. I am not using it for line in or microphone recording, so I don't know how it would function there, but for playback with any set of PC speakers and sub woofer, it's nice. For the price, it's a great sound card."
1,No go on 64 bit,"I should have listened to most of the other reviews. This card is garbage. Spent almost 2 hours trying to get it installed, and in the end, I still have ""No Audio output Device installed."""
5,Sabrent SBT-SP6C 6-Channel 5.1 Surround Sound 3D PCI Sound Card,"A very inexpensive sound card. Works great. If you want a better one, spend more money. This is a good card for the price. Had no problem downloading the driver for it. Did not use the CD that came with it. Would definitely buy another one like this. Only problem was the packaging in came in. Manufacture's Box was good but box was put in a plain brown envelope in the mail. One side of the box was crushed (got lucky and it Did not affect the sound card inside the box). Using a padded envelope would be a much better shipping option. For the money, it deserves a 5 star rating."
3,I haven't listened to it yet but,I thought it was only a myth that artists wore black turtle necks. Unless your saying...
4,Good Starting Point in Critical Discussion,"Actually stumbled across this book and read it on the plane in one sitting. I think the authors' insights and analysis proved rather accurate on the fate of the US housing market and potentially the broader US economy. I view this book as a great starting point for people looking to take a more pragmatic look at investments and investment opportunities. It's important that we protect ourselves in both rising and falling markets as I believe we are on the top of the downward slope. The authors tend to repeat themselves, I believe to drive home their point, so for more astute readers this may get a little tedious but well worth the read. Diversify my friends and protect yourselves as the US government, British Government etc... will not, they have their own interest at heart."
4,Practical roadmap to analytical success,"This book offers a Practical roadmap to analytical success for the novice of financial studies. It fills the (very) large gap between the sophisticated academic literature and the software tools (Excel, SPSS, Eviews) students need to use once they venture to explore financial data. The book guides the user in an informative and straigthforward manner to get results from the software. Concepts and statistical output are explained (but not too extensively) on the way. This leaves ample room for lecturers to enrich the book's tutorials with their own material.A minor criticism is that the book deals with most subjects rather briefly. Surely, this is to prevent ending up with a 1.000 page book. But on the other hand, I recommend that the author should write similar titles in the same manner but more dedicated to particular subjects, e.g. financial time series."
3,Good Read,"The Rachel Gold series has gone digital. And the entire series is available on Kindle for only $5 each!This is the debut novel about a female lawyer in Chicago. The mystery in the first half was pleasantly puzzling. The second half of the book required more than the usual suspension of disbelief, and the climax was all too predictable. But the heroine is very likeable, and the author's characterizations and dialogue in general were enjoyable.Although the Chicago setting was well defined, it didn't really make as strong an impact as some authors manage regionally, in say NYC or LA. However, you do feel you had an insider's view of a big city law firm. Given that this was written in the profligate 1980's, I couldn't help but wonder if the atmosphere would be the same in this era.I had a good time and am looking forward to the second in the series, Death Benefits."
2,Uttermost 24 inch mirror,"I would have loved it if it had not arrived shattered 2 times! I have seen this elsewhere and really loved it! Would have loved it in my home, however, ordered it twice and both times arrived shattered. I did not want to try it again!"
5,Superb introduction to a great mind.,"Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) was one of the great thinkers of the twentieth century. She was equally at home in philosophy, political theory, and history, and blended all three disciplines in her pursuit of integrity in political thought and action. This fine book is perhaps the single best place to begin to get to know her thought and work. The introduction is first-rate -- clear, accessible, yet intellectually rigorous, respectful of Arendt while critical. The choices of readings -- both complete and self-contained essays and extracts from larger books such as ORIGINS OF TOTALITARIANISM, EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM, and ON REVOLUTION -- are excellent. The annotations don't get in the way and are of much aid to the reader. The bibliography of works by and about Arendt is excellent. All in all, this is a superb addition to the VIKING PORTABLE series."
5,BRILLIANT!,"Please read all the other reviews because I am not going to get into details as they have. Talk about a book for it's time or a time for this book. Arendt is brilliant. I wish I could have been privileged to have spent 14 minutes and 37 seconds with her. It would have been a most enlightening experience. Between the way she writes and the way she thinks, this is must reading for anyone who is having a difficult time trying understand what is going on NOW! It would be fascinating to be able to bring her back. Even more fascinating about her was the fact that here was a Jewess, writing about the Nazis and Totalitarianism, who had a clandestine affair with Heidegger! This is one complex lady with a mind and writing ability that is well worth your investment in time reading. In a word... WOW!"
5,Best digital camera in it's price range!,"My husband and I have been looking for a solid digital camera for months. We found the HP 912 and both agreed that it was the best available. It has some weight to it so it doesn't feel like a toy. The operation of the camera is very simple and straight forward. The pictures are outstanding. We have tested in the sunlight, dark and with/without the flash. I would reccomend this camera to anyone who has ever used a SLR camera. It feels about the same and operates about the same. This was a great invention by HP and Pentex and would commend them on the job they have done."
5,servando y florentino rocks,I LOVE SERVANDO Y FLORENTINO ! II HAVE ALL THERE CD'S AND EVERYTIME I HEAR THEM THEY BRING A HPPY TEAR TO MY EYE!
2,from the drummer of the band,"i cant really say much about this album. proper grounds was Mavrics (madona's lable) first group signed. i was in the band, played club dates with them and recorded two songs on the album (i was the drummer) the album really didnt do too welldue to the lack of catchy hooks or mindbending grooves. but i had fun, rehersals, shows, and hanging out was a blast. the guys were mad cool. i dont think the band is still together."
2,Works Well Until It Falls Apart!,"I bought this case about 6 months ago for my Nokia 8260. I have been pleased with this case in that it did protect the phone from several drops and fit the phone well. All the holes were in the right places, etc. My complaint stems from the facts that after about 4 months, the spring clip that holds the phone to your belt began to loose its ability to keep the phone secure. It fell off the belt several times while seated. The chief complaint is that the material that hides the actual spring metal of the clip has started to unravel at the seam and has left the metal exposed. This is due to the wear of placing the phone on your belt."
5,Way 2 Fonky!!,"This cd is off da hook!!! Over the years i've had the pleasure of listening to zapp & roger, but have never owned any of their music. I just bought this cd 2 days ago, and I can't get it out of my head. This is what they call ""real music"". It is a shame that they are no longer with us today. This is the type of music I want to pass on to my kids. I would list the tracks I like but there are to many(not so sure about the remixes). If you like funk, and you dont have this cd, please get a check up from the neck up."
5,Roger was the man !,"This CD is vital to any funk/R&B collection. There are so many groundbreaking songs on this collection that it's impossible to pick my favorite. ""I wanna be your man"", ""Do it Roger"", and ""Doo wah Ditty"" are my personal faves. ""More Bounce"" is a classic. I still remember the first time I heard that, and the way Roger used that vocoder.This one will get the whole neighborhood out."
5,We Will Remember This Legend,This is a great cd. The master of the vocoder shows his skills! To bad he had to go! But his music will live on forever! I would advise you to buy this cd believe me you won't feel disapointed! R.I.P.Roger TroutmanWe Will Remember You Forever!
3,Full length album versions would have made this 5 stars!,"This collection had the potential to be a great CD, but the editing ruined the pleasure one would get with an album like this. If you're a die-hard fan-you will find some enjoyment from this CD."
4,Doing It,"Who can argue, when Zapp & Roger pioneered a style and sound, that any combination of their greatest hits wouldn't be above average? Many have imitated, but only fell short of the originality from these songs with a sense of timelessness. Hence, ""Computer Love"", long before the internet and or even the computer being more than an oversized calculator, this song was pure ingenious and futuristic. All The Greatest Hits contain 17 tracks, one of which is a medley of songs. Though some may sound similar, contain the same formula and the same swing that made these chart toppers."
5,DO IT ROGER DO IT!!!!!,"THIS IS AN OUT OF SIGHT CD. NO,ONE CAN TOUCH THIS MAN WHEN IT CAME TO FUNK. HE WAS REFERRED TO AS ""THE PRINCE OF FUNK"". HE WAS VERY FUNKY. HE HAD INCREDIBLE TALENT. I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG ON HERE I LOVE THIS CD. THIS CD WOULD HAVE YOU DANCING. I LIKE THIS CD IT IS WONDERFUL AND IT CONTAINS ALL OF MY FAVORITE HITS BY HIM. IF YOU ENJOYED ROGER BACK IN THE DAY THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY ENJOY THIS CD!!!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ZAPP AND ROGER FAN."
3,"Comfortable headphones with good sound. Brittle plastic, though.","I bought these headphones a while back as a replacement for an older set. They are surprisingly comfortable, not to heavy and don't get the ears hot after prolonged use. The sound quality is good, about what you would expect from an inexpensive set of headphones. The plastic used is somewhat brittle. In the climate I live in, it can get very cold, which certainly doesn't help. I recently had the left band above the headphone as I was taking them off on a particularly cold day, so I'm looking for a replacement now. I would still recommend them. They're a good product for the price."
3,Comfort was the reason,This was a gift. They sound good but the comfort was the reason the purchase was made. They are really comfortable for hours of use.
2,"Okay I guess for the money, I'm returning mine","Very very flat sounding. Even messing with the EQ in Winamp for 5 minutes I can't get them to sound ""clean/clear"".I'm promptly returning them, oh well.-editOMG!!! The Sennheiser EH-150 came in today that were going to replace the Labetcs. The EH-150 totally OWN compared to these Labtecs!!!! Amazon, please remove the Labtec Elite 835 from your line up, they are very, very, very, very, sub-par!"
5,great buy,This item along with the booda box has helped keep cat litter off all my floors and the smell of it has gone with it!
1,Waste of money,This did absolutely nothing for catching litter. The plastic is smooth so the litter just slides right off and then gets all over the floor. At least this was fairly cheap so I didn't lose too much money on this one.
1,No less litter on my floor...,"Although this mat looks nice, unfortunately, it doesn't do a good job of trapping the litter. I think it needs smaller tracks to catch the litter. Since the tracks are so large, the litter just gets stuck on my kitty's feet the next time he walks on it and he carries it onto the floor. I guess I will have to keep looking!"
4,Singing with my granddaughter,I bought this for my 2 year granddaughter who loves music and loves to sing. She can put the CDs into the player and sing the various songs.
1,"Most annoying CD, EVER!","Seriously, THE most annoying, agrivating and mind-numbing children's Christmas album, EVER. My 4 year old loves it, but I absolutely can not stand the lame sounding voices they sing in... on top of the cutsie sounding music. SO disgusting. Worse than nails on a chalkboard. Pray to GOD that your kids don't like this CD If you receive it as a gift. If you value your sanity, by all means avoid this CD like the plague!"
5,LOVE IT,DKJFA KDJF AKDJ AKDJF A F AFJA ASDKJF AK AF ADFJ AKDJF ADKJF ADKF ADKJFAKDJF A FAJF A FKAJF AF
1,It was not new!,"This cd arrived and was not shrink wrapped, the case was broken and it is obviously used. Poor advertisement. I could've bought a ""used"" one for 3 less dollars!"
4,Great Christmas CD for kids,My 18 month old loves this CD. I read some reviews that complained about the annoying voices but it's a CD for kids so what do you expect? The voices do not bother me and my daughter loves it. I bought her several other little people CD's for Christmas and I think she will like those too.
2,Hated it!,"I wanted all these women to die, from the beginning. I love Laymon, but all the flashback/backstory annoyed the hell out of me! I couldnt care less what happened to them by the end of it. I loved the hillbilly overlook hotel, and the ""ghost story"" to scare everyone there, but that was about it, everything else was useless fluff."
1,Trash !!!!!!,Read Come Out Tonight.. or Beast House or The Midnight Tour by the same author !! This book was like The Hills Have Eyes.. or Wrong Turn 2 !!! Absolutely Horrible !!!!!!!!!!!
1,Booooring,"Didn't think Laymon was able to write a slow paced, boring book until I read Blood Games. Nothing happens for the longest time, and I ended up skipping most of the flashbacks. Don't waste your times with this one, when Laymon's written so many fun, creepy, and fast paced novels such as Island, Bite, and In the Dark."
1,Yuck!,"While reading this I realized that Blood Games holds the dubious distinction of being the worst book I have ever read. Forget for a moment that it is not scary and is in fact BORING-Laymon wrote this book as if from the point of view of a hormonal 13 year- old boy in the 1950s who wants to be a writer when he grows up but doesn't know yet that he has no talent! These grown women (college graduates) do and say things I've never seen or heard any other woman do. They talk like men (or perhaps 13 year old boys) and use language I haven't heard in atleast 25 years. I was bored to tears by all the talk about their bare body parts (no-these were not sexual situations.) No, women do not frequently hang out naked together for no reason, No, we do not walk naked in the woods because it's TOO HOT to wear a tank top, No, I did not finish this book and No I will not try another Laymon."
2,Save your money - check this out at the library!,"This book is not worth your money; I wish I hadn't paid full price. I was expecting some fun, some chills, some scares and it really only gave me goosebumps thinking of the fact that I paid for this when I could have gotten something better to read for the price I paid.Don't get me wrong it had some scary moments but was overall it was a flop. Much of it was boring - especially the flashbacks which went on for chapters. The ending felt forced and rushed.And oh man did the women in the book run around naked a lot. C'mon even when you are being pursued by a madman you cover up! I don't want to speak ill of the dead (I read that Richard Laymon has died) but this just seemed like a weird fantasy playing out for him - all the naked and lesbian-suggestive moments.Save your money."
3,Laymon's Weakest Book,"Richard Laymon has delivered us the masterful ""In the Dark"" and ""Island"", but unfortunately ""Blood Games"" is no masterpiece. Too many flashbacks interrupted the pace and tension of the story. Many of the characters engage in actions that go against their characteristics and seem quite unbelievable. This is not a book to start if you want a good introduction to Laymon. It's mildly enjoyable, but give his other work a try because he's still one of the top 10 horror writers of the last two decades."
1,Literary Garbage,"I'll never understand the accolades that some readers give this writer. There is a simple formula at work here and through the rest of Laymon's novels: combine a ludicrous premise, sprinkled with gratutitous violence and sex. Forget about character development, solid story-telling, or convincing dialogue. Laymon is more concerned with pandering to a readership that finds literary exploitation-trash to be a work of literary merit.It's this type of so-called horror fiction that gives the genre a bad name."
4,Good but not great,"I have read about 10 of Richard Laymon's books and I have liked them all. This is also an entertaining story. Richard has a knack for combining suspense, horror, funny dialogue and sexual overtones that keep you turning pages. I have actually come to enjoy his books more than Stephen Kings'. The two best books Laymon has written is ""The Traveling Vampire Show"" and ""Island"". Since his death I am slowly working my way through all of his novels savoring each of them. If you enjoyed this novel I also recommend David Morrel's novel ""Creepers"". They have similar story lines. For now Richard Laymon is still my favorite Horror writer."
2,Skip This!,"This was a REAL letdown!How often do we have to read that the women's clothes were wet? Of COURSE they are when you get out of the water!And pages go on and on and on with them swimming and you THINK something will happen...and NOTHING happens.And those boring flashbacks -- skip them, they add NOTHING -- and why do the women wisecrack throughout the ordeal.Ugh!"
4,interesting video,Even tho they warn of abundant nudity. Only the very pretty lite skin black woman at beginning if fully nude. The white female thats pregnant is nude from waist up. And the guy is inside a plywood form. But still interesting work
3,Don`t expect a head with snakes,"Poor picture quality on both with only fair stories, but what can you expect from a dollar store? Medusa has a misleading title (nothing like the Greek Myth). More of a crime drama. Fer de Lance reminds one of Snakes on a Plane and Snakes on a Train, except this is snakes on a submarine and not nearly as exciting. However I think this movie was the first to come up with the idea of snakes in a close space"
2,I should have read to reviews,"I,m upset I have had the product one day and my volume doesnt work.. I had no Idea that I would not be able to see my daughter at night.. Plus you pay more here than if you go straight to aiptek web site... I cant return it to a store I have to pay to put back in the mail..."
2,SLIP ON SHOES,"HAVE A PAIR OF THE MESH ONES,, LOVE THEM,, THEY CAN BREATH A LITTLE,, BUT THESE LEATHER ONES DONT BREATH AT ALL, MY FOOT GETS SO HOT AND SWEATS. I WANTED IT SO I COULD JUST WIPE THEM OFF.. BUT NOT WORTH IT.. RATHER JUST THROUGH MY OTHER PAIR IN THE WASH WHEN THEY GET DIRTY. AND COST WAY TO MUCH!!!!"
3,Fairly Good,Fairly good soundLong wiresSometimes painful to wear - not recommended for continuous useGood price
4,Second set,"The first set was so good I purchased a second set. Good sound and a long cord. Reasonably comfortable to wear, too."
4,Low priced headphones,"These are a great buy for the price. Are they audiophile quality, no, no, no. Are they good to hook up to a dvd player for use in the car.....oh-ya. Sound is a little muddy overall. The long cord is what most headphones lack and was a huge selling point to me."
1,disappointing!!,lab tech used to be synonamous with quailty now it's easy to acquant with junk!! (china) as made in....
4,Half a collection.,"The Smiths are an amazing band, these are incredible songs, and this is a decent collection. I had this disc once and always felt I was missing something, and that was ""Volume 1"". These 14 songs are wonderful again, but if you don't get this with ""Volume 1"", skip it. For one-stop shopping, I might suggest ""Singles"", which is 18 tracks on one disc, and more bang for your buck. If price is no factor, go for the remastered import ""Very Best Of"" which is 23 tracks long. I'd even recommend the 24 track ""Louder Than Bombs"", though that's missing a few essential songs. Obviously you have many choices, but only 14 Smiths songs is not a good one."
2,You've already heard all of the information in this book.,"I've been hearing about this book for 4 years. After reading it, I realized that I've already heard about/read all the important parts on the Internet. So it was kind of a waste to sit down and read the whole thing. It's just a very wordy book. Wordy and kind of boring. Some parts were interesting, but I'd rather hear about ways to help one child in particular, not ways to help the entire universe of children. I guess I'm more concerned about my kid than about your kid. Sorry about that."
5,The Last Child in the Woods,"Perhaps one of the best book even written, it hits home of our children who siting in the house day after day watching TV and playing computer games. Children do not know how to play outside in Nature these days. A lot of todays children view parks and woods as dangerious place to play rather a place to enjoy. ALL PARENTS SHOULD READ THIS BOOK TODAY."
5,Lost child,An incredible book that points out how kids now are completely cut off from nature. It shows practical ways to expose your kids to the outside world. Recommended highly!!!
5,A Call to Action,"What a wonderful concept: nature-deficit disorder. I remember summer days turning up rocks in the creek to find crawdads, and wandering through woods and pastures under the hot Kansas sun. Because of those experiences and my parent's interest and encouragement, I care about animals, plants and the state of the planet.Are today's children missing all that? If their exposure to nature is television documentaries and carefully orchestrated trips to a petting zoo, will they bond with nature? There's no question that electronic gadgets occupy too much of their time and has consequences beyond short attention spans and weight gain.I wish parents would read this book and take steps to unplug their child and provide regular outdoor time both structured and free time."
3,Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv,Contains important messages on the dangers of our technological society as they relate to parenting and education in our western societies. The book could have been a lot shorter and just as effective.
3,I couldn't even finish it....,"I wanted to like this book a lot and I did like parts, but it is very depressing for someone like me who is raising my small kids in a very urban area. I would love to move to the woods, but that is not my families reality. We go on hikes and play outside a lot, but thinking of that while reading this book just feels not good enough. I would recommend it because I do agree that future generations of kids (as well as my kids generation) are on a fast track of becoming completely disconnected with nature and all the wonderful, healing things it has to offer!"
4,Interesting,"More interesting than you might think. In the case of this reader, he's preaching to the choir, but there are lots of anecdotes and statistics to back him up. Children need contact with nature to calm their minds, exercise their bodies, stimulate their creativity, but our society has come to thwart those possibilities at every turn. As an example of how nature-phobic we have become, everyone who saw this book in my hand read the title, ""LOST Child in the Woods."" Read and weep and work for change."
5,Every parent shoud read this,"This book hits like a pan in the face, giving you the answers to what's wrong with the kids today. It will inspire you to turn of the Playstation and bring the kids to a creek to play and watch their stresses dissapear and their senses awaken.After reading the book I have made a consciuous effort to use nature everyday in the upbringing of my 3 children, calming one with ADHD, stimulating one that is gifted and making a cranky baby girl a happy one crawling around in the leaves.If you are a parent, grandparent or teacher - please read this book!"
2,Meh,"I really wanted to like this book, but I feel like the author really wrote this for the layperson whose emotions are moved by some of the thin arguments. If you are a scientist, you will not like this book."
3,Upside down book,"The book is great; however, my copy was printed upside down from the cover! A very interesting read :) I do love the content, it's inspiring."
2,Sappy with no depth,"The book came quickly and was in the same condition described. I have no problem with the seller. But the content of the book is lacking. I was expecting depth and real data to support their claims. Instead it was just a bunch of feel good mumbo jumbo. I totally believe children need to spend more time in nature, but this book did not convince me of that."
5,Last Child in the Woods,"Awesome! A must read for the ""Green Revolution"" and as importantly for your ""heart & soul""!!!"
5,Must read,This is a must read for every parent with children. We remember our connection with nature and yet our children have lost it. Without our conscious effort to reconnect them with nature they will move further and further away.
2,Too much of the same thing,The whole concept is an interesting one but the book drug on with the same message.
1,"Put down this book,take a kid for a hike.","I am used to academic articles with multiple footnotes but not the constant references used in Last Child. There are two or three proper names per paragraph. The constant references to others interrupts the flow of the narrative. If this sort of pseudoscience is used,let us have an abstract and a conclusion for each section,like a decent science paper. Make it a little easier on the reader. To be fair, I stopped at page 35 when there appeared to be no relief in sight. The basic idea could be clearly stated in three or four pages,not four hundred. Maybe 3-4 words,nature-deficit disorder.OK, maybe too short a sample,so just open to 228 and it's facing page: seven proper names, often with their qualifications and one long quote. If there are any original ideas they are hidden within the annotations. Consider going straight to his website."
4,Definite pass along book,"The author is passionate on his subject and the passion is infectious. He interviews authors who have done research in the area: viewing greenspace helps you recover from injury, unstructured outdoor play helps children's concentration and impulse control and so on. I was inspired by his many helpful suggestions for family activities and by his descriptions of locally focused environmental education. He also provides many useful outside readings and links to like-minded organizations. You will find this book very useful!"
4,Leave No Child Inside,This is a very important book for parents and those in the educational system to read and heed. This book has started a national conversation on what we can do to get our children outdoors and into nature.
3,Pretty Decent,"This Bourjois Khol & Contour eyeliner pencil is pretty good, & the over all quality is decent, this product is not horrible."
5,supergenius,"i got this cd for 5 bux at a converge show a long time ago because the art on the front looked interesting in a technical way. and years and years later this cd is still one of the most unique approaches to music i have ever heard. it isn't just ""noise"" or ""experimental"" it's a whole new approach. because i listen to straight noise and experimental stuff and this is much more formulated, much more substantial and expressly thought out song composition, though it fluidly incorporates experimental avant garde type elements. pretty much it's one of my all time favorite albums because it is so complex and bizarre and expressive that nothing else i have ever heard comes anywhere near to its style. and i listen to a LOT of abnormal music. it really hits on some strange, significant and rarely recognized universal vibrations. after i got it i listened to it literally every night when i went to sleep for like 8 or 9 months. it's incredible."
2,"A disappontment, not a compatible duo","This album was a disappointment. It lacks Metheny's usual melodic vision and Mehldau's usual proficiency. The album is muddled. Many of the tunes are merely noodling, and go nowhere.These two are individually great artists, Metheny ranks as one of the all time jazz guitar greats, but this album was not a good idea. Either they were rushed and did not put their best efforts into the compositions, or they had a bad six months.I would NOT recommend this album to any Metheny or Mehldau fans, and I own nearly every album of Metheny's and have listened to Mehldau extensively.Better luck next time."
3,Melancholy duo,"It is quite a departure from the usual up tempo that you would expect from one of the greastest jazz guitarist of our time. The deviation from the steadfast Pat Metheny sound is OK and is still good listening, just not great!"
5,Metheny & Mehldoa,I like alot!! Pat Metheny has got to be one of the most diverse and consistant musicians. I am never dissapointed in any musician he coordinates with!
3,Over-busy,"Hmmm....I dunno about this one. True, it does sound like the classic Jim Hall/Bill Evans disc, as some point out. On the other hand, it's a bit lifeless, sounds at times like over-busy noodling by each musician as they ignore each other, or try to top each other, only both at once. I wish they had maybe taken more time to rehearse the tunes, make some arrangements with some s p a c e between the notes."
1,Turkey of the Year Award 2006... Brad Mehldau,"The once promising and inventive jazz pianist who amazed us all with his Art of the Trio series, cool versions of Radiohead and Nick Drake tunes, and the stunning solo effort Elegiac Cycle, was responsible for not one... not two... but THREE bland, ponderous, and entirely forgettable albums released on the Nonesuch label in 2006.House On Hill has his stellar original trio coasting along aimlessly through Mehldau originals that all sound the same, the ambitious Love Sublime, a collaboration with opera superstar Renee Fleming, is a dreary, pretentious, and unlistenable mess, and Metheny/Mehldau pairs the pianist with the jazz guitar legend for a yawn-fest of uninspired noodling.Here's to hoping Brad Mehldau gets his mojo back in 2007..."
3,"Good in theory, end result puzzling","When I first heard that Pat and Brad were making an album together it was like WOW, I can't wait. I guess my expectations were way too high, (given the incredible tallent of both). So when I first listened to it, it was strange, I felt something missing. Then I heard it again, and again. It started to warm, but never caught fire.So I had to break it apart. On Mehldau side, very good. On Metheny side, very good but as stand alone, it missses in retrospect (comparing this project to other collaborations, like say the Jim Hall album, Question and Answer and Rejoicing).But in no way is this an inferior album, the playing and writting is superb.I would recommend it, but Pat and Brad have better."
1,It reeks of corporate hype!,Jazz is dying because of recordings like this. Pretentious noodling of the highest order. Save your money because nothing is challenging about this recording. I just hope they don't put out any more!
3,good but not good enough .,"A plaisant new cd from the superstar duo , but not a memorable one . A definite lack of musical partnership in this one.....maybe the next one .There is just too much music in this cd , it sounds like Metheny is playing non stop all over the place , Mehldau is defitly in secong role here and unfortunatly does not sounds like himself in most of the tracks .too bad , next recording maybe ."
2,kind of long,"These songs ultimately do not overcome their absurdly long running times and overproduced sound. Rane's first disc, ""At War With The Moon"", features stronger writing and jams that don't always overstay their welcome."
3,"Nice mix, but..","I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault."
4,Peppercorn Mix,I found this product to be a nice tasting pepper blend and would recommend it to all of those who enjoy the fresh flavor of ground pepper.
3,peppercorns with bad packaging.,"this is a great mixture of peppercorns, but the package is a crisp cellophane which tore quickly when I gently tried to pry the edges apart. The result was peppercorns scattered everywhere and I lost about a third of them. I probably would not purchase again for that reason."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this nailer based on having 3 Bostich nailers over a year old & used every day with no problems out of the box or on the job site. I purchased the SDA250K expecting the same out of the box performance. It was recived & put to work however after firing three nails it jambed removed the jamb & fired three more jambed again, same routine three more times & put it back in the case & emailed Amazon. Being the high quality retailer they are sent me out another SDA250K which was received promptly unpacked it, loaded the nails & was able to put up one piece of 7"" crown before encountering the same issue. I have emailed Stanley & have not received a response but received a return authorization immediately from Amazon. Maybe Stanley needs some total quality lessons from a person who has been a manufacturing production & quality consultant for a lot years or recognize customer satisfaction & service as a basis of competitive survival."
4,Great Design!,"This garden fence has a great design and it is sturdy. A lot of garden fences seem to be flimsy, but this one is exactly what I was looking for."
4,Best price for Alli,"Alli, the new government approved OTC weight loss product really does work. However, it is absolutely necessary to follow the instructions to the letter. It works on a negative behavior modification program. If you cheat, you get unpleasant side effects that, although not dangerous, are uncomfortable. This is a good aid for a dedicated dieter who needs a little extra help. I thought the accompanying diet had too many calories for my weight and cut it down myself. It is definitely not a quick weight loss, but sticking with it will bring slow results.The materials included with the pills are helpful as is the website which gives you guidance and will provide answers to questions about the use of the product."
4,Good stuff,"After searching high and low in the stores for Alli for months I had no luck, however I was able to find it on this site."
4,Works slowly but well,"I wish it worked faster, but I guess that's the point-- it's the weight watchers of diet drugs (i.e. slow but steady wins the race). I've lost about a pound and it's been three weeks. I think if I step up the exercise I'll lose more quickly."
4,It works if you follow the plan,"I've been taking the pill for 12 days and I have lost 3lbs. I was very shock. Ive been eating low fat and working out for months and the scale never would change until I started taking Alli. I could only imagine how much I would have lost if I worked out in those 12 days. The treatments effects keep you on your toes, everytime I thought about cheating I think of the side effects, so I grab some fruit instead of a cookie. Next week I will continue to eat low fat and add about 4 to 5 cardio sessions and see what happens. I will keep you posted."
2,Alli is not for me.,"I have taken Alli 3x a day for the last month. I believe that this product is kind of pointless when you are already following a low-fat diet. I never had treatment effects. I have lost 6 pounds but I believe it's because I'm losing weight the old-fashioned way.. with keeping my caloric intake in my range for weight loss, and working out vigorously most every day. I don't believe this pill has done anything for me except in the beginning made me want to stay away from fatty foods because of the apparent treatment effects. Once I wasn't interested in eating fatty foods and began eating healthy, I felt that taking the pills was unnecessary, and didn't feel the need to depend on them. I will continue my journey without Alli. Good luck and success to those of you that are using Alli. I hope you reach your weight loss goal!"
2,something to get use to,"I received my product in a timely manner. I however had problems taking the pills. PLEASE understand that you will be having oily discharge from your butt, and that you will feel as though you have taken a laxative everyday. It was very inconvenient. Imagine trying to be romantic with your husband or just having a normal life when you are running to the bathroom and wearing pads for uncontrollable oily discharge. My diet was modified to little to no fat and still them same issue. I did however lose weight."
1,Be very careful with this product,"I have been using Alli every day since it was first put on the market. I have always known that Alli leaches vitamins and minerals from your body. They state very clearly on the instructions to take a multi vitamin at bed time because of this.I have always taken a multi vitamin at bed and eat a very healthy diet, however I recently went to the eye doctor because I was losing my eyesight. At 35 years old I found out that I have early onset of cataracts. Early onset of cataracts is frequently caused by a lack of vitamins and minerals. This is a frequent affliction for young People in very poor countries with inadequate and poor nutrition I put two and two together and realized what caused it. I immediately stopped taking Alli. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,WARNING! IT WILL MAKE YOU JITTERY,"I took this for 3 days was fine those days, no symptoms.... Day 4, when I woke up in the morning, I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was jittery, nauseous, heart was racing, felt like i was gonna pass out. Went to doctor, he said it was the Alli, after about 4 hours was better and no more of those symptoms! Didn't take it again and its been 4 weeks and none of those symptoms again so I know it was the Alli! The product doesn't even suggest those type of symptoms! It must be something hidden in the ingredients."
1,it didn't work for me,"THE ALLI PROGRAM HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL FOR ME EVEN AFTER THREE WEEKS. I HAVEN'T LOST ANY WEIGHT AND I NEVER HAD ANY OF THE UNPLEASANT SIDE EFFECTS.I EVEN PURPOSELY ATE A HIGH FAT MEAL TO SEE IF I WOULD HAVE THE OILY STOOLS, AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND FEEL THAT IT WAS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY."
2,Alli experience,I have discontinued use of this product because of the extreme change in bowel movement. If I wanted continual loose stools I could take a cheap laxitive. Big hipe poor product!!!
2,Ehh.,Gave this a try since I've heard so much about it and whatnot. I followed the direction/diet but didn't lose much weight. Gave me really bad gas and stomach aches. Stopped using it after 2 months. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
4,The Alli Diet Product,"I thought I had ordered the 120 capsule refill package but received the 90 pill start up package. But, since I was totally out of the pill, I just accepted the error. I'm not sure if Alli really works or not. I haven't lost any weight on it and I have taken it for a couple of years now. However, I haven't gained any either and I eat pretty much as I want. (No diet) I think I would probably be gaining a bit if I didn't take it. It use to assist me on keeping the bowels moving on schedule but that doesn't seem to be working any more."
1,Horrible!,"The side effects of alli are not worth it for taking this pill. I had a diet of almost no fat and I still suffered from oil stool often time that I could not control and had to leave work several times to change. I suggest Hydroxycut Hardcore instead, cheaper and works much better and no awful side effects."
1,Diet and Exercise does the trick without Alli,"I bought the 120 pill pack from Costco and over the course of 2 months, I religiously took the pill, cut back on most fats and did moderate exercise. Even after all of that, I lost a measly 1 lb which I would've lost anyway without the Alli pills. My weight during that time went up and down +/-2 pounds.I am on the boderline of ""normal"" and ""over weight"" so I don't have a lot to lose but 1 measly pound is not worth the cost and trouble of having to count your fats and calories.The only thing I found Alli worthwhile for was as a constant reminder that I needed to watch what I ate and get some exercise. I get that from my conscience and it doesn't cost a thing.So, no more Alli for me. It was not worth the treatment effects (which subsided after a couple of weeks for me once I learned to control fat intake) nor the cost."
3,Be on the look out,"In 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received reports of serious liver injury in people using orlistat and began a safety review. At this time, no definite association has been established between orlistat and the risk of liver injury. However, if you take Alli be sure to contact your doctor if you experience signs and symptoms, such as weakness or fatigue, fever, jaundice, or brown urine, which could indicate liver injury."
1,Alli doesn't work any more--Don't waste your money,"The old Alli used to work good, but don't waste your money on the new Alli, for it has no treatment effects at all. I know how Alli works because I took it for a long time. It was taken off the market and returned in June with new ingredients that does not work at all. I even put enough fat in my diet just to test it and no effects what so ever."
3,You get better result from working out more,"I bought this a few months ago and I personally don't recommend it. I had been in a 3 month rigorous exercise program and lost more by sweating it off the old fashion way than taking these pills. No hating just the truth. I thought the pills would help me lose extra fat faster, I was so wrong.It took a week for it to start taking any real effects, and by the time it did I wanted it to stop. Couldn't go to a hot tub or pool thinking Omg will I have an ""accident"" now? That is not living. I watched what I ate and exercised twice a day and only lost 2 lbs with the pills. I stopped taking them, and I swear I lost 15 additional lbs just with my exercise and eating right. I always struggled with my weight, and deciding to just go for it and do lots of cardio. Honeslty its not worth your money."
2,Just Okay,"Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli."
2,Alli and absortion of Vitamins,"I began using Alli some time ago. I found it effective in weight loss but didn't like the oily bowl movements. After a month I started developing joint, bone, and muscle pain. While continuing with Alli I began seeking medical assistance for the pain. After seeing a Rheumatologist I discovered I had a vitamin D deficiency causing the debilitating pain. After further inspection I noticed the fine print on the bottle of Alli, ""Oristat can reduce the absorbtion of of some vitamins."" Bingo, there's where my Vitamin D deficiency came from. Needless o say I have stopped taking Alli."
4,Alli - The Diet Product,"Alli is kind of touchy. You have to make sure you have eaten enough fat before you take each pill. For some this is easy. For others this is not.Also, you might find yourself getting cramps. I did a few times and they were quite painful, but they didn't last very long at all.Try it is all I can say, but be careful. As far as weight loss goes, its kind of early yet, i've only lost a couple so far."
2,Not for me,I was not able to continue with this product. I had severe headaches and stomach cramps even with following a low fat diet. You must take vitamins at night and exercise. I would like to know how I go about getting a efund for the unused product.
4,I like this product,"I've used this product before and, not to be gross, but I like seeing the fat come out with my own eyes. Yes, the side effects are horrible if you overdo the fat content, so that is a good incentive to cut down the fat that you eat. Otherwise, I haven't really had a problem with the side effects. I increased my fiber and water intake, so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. I have yet to decide if it's worth the extra bucks."
1,Can cause a bowel problem,This product not only did not work. It caused a bowel problem(constipation) that lasted for three days. It did not matter how much fat I ate I did not get any reaction . It was if I had not taken anything that would affect the amount of fat in my diet.I tried to eat a high fat meal to see if it would cause any kind reaction and nothing happned. It may work for some but I had to discontinue using it. It turned put to be a real waste of money I have almost an entire bottle left
1,Do the Math!,"I bought this because of all the hype and before I did the math. I am not fat, but gained 9 lbs. when I quit smoking and haven't been able to lose them. Alli specifies that you can eat no more than 15 grams of fat per meal--or 45 grams of fat per day. And Alli promises to block absorption of 25% of that fat--which equates to approximately 11-1/4 grams of fat per day. Do you know how many calories are in a gram of fat? I didn't, but I discovered that it was 9 calories ... yes 9 calories in a gram of fat. That meant that this new, expensive wonder drug was blocking absorption of 101 calories per day!! At that rate, Alli will help me lose one pound (3500 calories) every 34 days."
3,Not worth the money or the embarassing oily discharge,"It's common sense: exercise at least 30 minutes per day, limit your fat intake and cut out sweets. This is the ""diet plan"" that is included with the pills. If I followed that, I wouldn't need the pills. And if I followed that plan, I wouldn't need to diet in the first place. Duh! The pills are just there to remind you when you've consumed too much fat - when you least expect it, you get that nasty ""oily discharge"" that you've heard about. Having lost only 2 pounds after two weeks - it's not worth the oily discharge or the money."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"While I do see that the product reduces the amount of fat that is absorbed, I wouldn't really categorize it as a weight loss aid. You have to do much more than just take the pills. Also, you can get the same results, without any side effects, just by watching what you eat and cutting the amount of fat you take in. Reducing caloric/fat intake and exercise are still key to weight loss."
1,Alli Weight Loss Product,"Did not Like this product at all.No loss of weight.I exersize regularly & walk every day to and from work and everywhere I go.I eat a well balanced, high fiber, nutritious diet & still experienced the disgusting side effects that comes w/this product.no thanks, I will pass on this product."
1,Disgusting!,Me and my girlfriend wanted and needed to lose weight. We decided that she would take ALLI and I would just eat a low fat diet and exercize with her as ALLI reccommends.The results: After 1 month I had lost 6 pounds and she had lost 4 pounds. We both did the exact same thing besides she took ALLI for a month and I didn't.The kicker: She was miserable and was finshed with ALLI after the end of the month. This because of the continuous gas and oily discharge that happened if she ate the slightest bit of fat. It was absolutely discusting to think that people would endure these side effect for that little bit of weight loss.Not to mention I won! How'd I do it? I exercized 3 times a week by walking and riding a bike and I ate sweets only on Saturday. I cut the starches & sugars and cooked with olive oil plus ate wheat bread for sandwiches.Summary: This pill isn't worth it! You're making ALLI rich while they laught at your bathroom difficulties. It's like a sick joke!
2,meh,After 2 months and countless underwear that I have tossed out I quit.Does it work? Sure.I'm not a fan of the oil.Onward I go.
1,"side effects, but no weight loss","I have a lap-band. I have lost all but 25 pds of my excess weight and have been at 165 for almost 2 years. I thought I would try to jump start the extra pounds off by using this product. WHAT A WASTE ! I have taken most of the 120 pill bottle and with some side effects, but not alot since I do not eat much. I havent lost 1 single pound ! Save your money !!!!!!!!"
2,You can do it for yourself!,You must adhere to the instructions strictly. If you deviate at all you will have the side effects mentioned and they are not pleasant. If you can adhere to the insturctions and follow a non fat diet then you really don't need this product in the first place.
1,"I did everything correctly, and it did NOTHING","This one of the most useless weight loss aids I've ever used. I think perhaps it just doesn't work for some people. So try at your own risk, just be prepared to throw away a pretty penny for no results."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I eat a well balanced diet. For some reason this pill did not deliver ANY of the results is said it would. I have been taking it for about 2 months and nothing, zip, zilch, nada!"
2,can't go out after i eat...,"I tried alli and was really getting into the diet, counting my fat grams and calories, however, it still had me cramping and rushing to the bathroom within the first half our or so after the meal, then the effects would stay with me throughout the day. gas, bloating, more gas, orange/yellow stools...ick! not at all worth it. next!"
3,Not what it said,"I was under the impression that this was the 'starter pack'. It was not. It was the capsules without the book or case. I could have paid less for just capsules. This description was completely inaccurate. On a plus side, it was shipped on time and the pills do work wonders as long as you eat properly."
3,It works....kinda,"this product worked amazing the first few weeks. I lost about 20 lbs in the first month, but I was just heavy enough to use it. After I lost the 20lbs I was under the weight guidelines for use, but still no where near as healthy as I wanted to be (I was after the 20lbs about 145 and 5'3""). The potential side effects helped motivate me to stick to the diet. But even so, once I was just a few pounds under the suggested weight usage I started to get those side effects even when I cut back even more than the diet suggested. At that point, it was not worth it. By any means, really bad side effects. I ruined a lot of sheets and clothes in a few days. User beware. If you are not significantly overweight it will not work for you."
1,Didn't work for me,"I think this product would work best on an extremely overweight person. I just wanted to lose 10 lbs. Since I stopped it I have actually lost weight. I think a person might think they can eat more while taking these pills but not the case. Also, you need to take a multi vitamin daily because otherwise all of your vitamins from your food are flushed away."
4,New to Alli,"I was really hesitant to try this out, but after talking to my doctor I decided to try it. It's only been about a month, but it's been pretty interesting ( on a good note). This pill works along w/exercise.I've read alot of the reviews before I made this purchase. Some people had complaints about the side effects, truth is ...if you eat a proper diet and take fiber supplements ( suggested by my doctor) everything will be ok. I haven't lost weight just yet, but I do see a differance, I'm going to continue this for a couple more months."
1,DONT DO IT!,"Ally is terrible and shouldn't be on the market. I took it, and it was awful. I only took it for one week. If you don't have enough fat in your diet, you get so constipated that it actually physically hurts. If you have too much fat in your diet, you get constant diarrea, and in my case blood started to show. I am a healthy person, with no underlying medical conditions. Even after stopping the pills, I saw blood in the bathroom for the next 2 days. Anything that causes blood to come out CANT be safe."
1,???????????,it is not what i expected...maybe cuz im on Nutisystem too..but it realy didnt do any diff:(..im still taking hoping it wii do something..
2,anal leakage,"I have not actually lost weight on this product, but then again im not really over weight. Im trying it again, mostly to discourage myself from eating fatty foods. The more fats you take in, the more anal leakage you will have so it makes eating healthy.. or at least less fatty a must. The threat of sharting in my pants is usually enough to keep me from eating a ton of cheese dip or fries. usually."
1,Great for constant trips to the bathroom,I bought this product about a year ago and figured it would help to shave off a little of the extra fat that I eat to help me to lose weight. I never saw a weight difference and when I would eat I would end up with trip to the bathroom and have some sort of oily discharge that really made using this stuff uncomfortable.
2,Image does not match product shipped,"Beware! if you are expecting the starter pack that includes the product literature and handy pill holder, you will be disappointed as the only thing you will recieve is a bottle of 90 pills. This is by no means a starter pack, it is a bottle of pills. i am very dissapointed as i would have liked some product inforamation and a safe way to carry the 3 pills a day that i will be taking."
4,alli does have side effectsif you eat to much fat,i have been taking my alli for three days now ive noticed when i eat too much fat i do have side effects but it reminds me to watch my fat intake ill keep taking my alli and ill let you know how much i lose in a few more days i reccomend this product to any one serious about losing weight it reminds you to stay on track watching what you eat or youll have side effects using the bathroom. good luck to everyone trying my alli.
5,Gentle and Effective - A great Product!,I wanted something without caffeine that would not make me nauseous. This is great to take with the 'larger' meal at dinner or launch. If you eat too much fatty foods you will definitely feel the 'treatment effects'. If you have a regular balanced diet you will have no issues. Alli basically teaches you to eat healthier. Add exercise to the mix and you'll quickly start to notice the differnce and feel much better. I recommend this to men and women alike.
2,BEWARE THE OILY SPOTTING,"Read up on this product before you decide to buy it. I started off experimenting by taking Alli with both low fat and high fat foods to see how I would be affected. With low fat foods, you will be fine. I experienced only mild headaches and that was it. With high fat foods, I can tell you the ""oily spotting"" side effect IS REAL. The company isn't kidding about needing to wear a maxi-pad because of the amount of oily spotting. It's not just a droplet, and it's bright orange in color. It's gross and it will stain your clothing and your toilet. You really have to watch what you eat when you take this drug, but then again, that's the idea! Personally, I think I am going to stick to Green tea tablets."
2,so so,Why cant you just click the number of stars and be done? Most of time I do not want to go into detail.
2,I didn't lost weight,"I eat it almost 3 weeks ,and regular dinner ,do some sports,but still 150 p .I still hungry ,I t's not work ~"
1,not worth the money,"Just another waste of money for me. Saw no difference in weight loss, but did experience lots of discomfort."
2,Alli Weight Loss Aid,"I have not had the weight loss that I was expecting. I was only needing to lose 5-7 pounds and had been watching my fat & calories before I started the pills. I exercise everyday, 3 times a week for 45 min. with a class and then walk and ride my bike on the other days of the week. I have not lost any weight with Alli."
2,Not worth it,"I took Alli for about a month and lost about 15 pounds total. I ate right so I didnt really have any treatment effects. I also took vitamins daily as it stated. Yet, while taking it after a few weeks I noticed I was feeling a bit strange. Then all the sudden I started having panic attacks which I have never had in my life that put me in the E.R. I havent had any stressful situations in my life so I knew it was the Alli. Now I am off of it the attacks have decreased but still present. I am a healthy person in general so I believe its the Alli."
3,Still trying to break in,Well I haven't lost much yet(into end of week 1) but did experience the oily discharge. But that is not my major concern; my period is getting 5 days late from the usual and I am suspecting if this has to do anything with this. Can it mess up the cycles?
1,dissappointed!!,"I ordered this product because I had heard so many good things about the product, and the product might actually work but my box had been properly shipped but when I opened the bottle it had already been opened and was completely empty, these are not cheap and this was a huge dissappointment.... however, when I let the company know they refunded my money."
1,waste of money,"I bought this product about a month ago. I followed all of the directions, such as dieting as well as exercising regularly. i have lost no weight to date. It took about a week to even see any of the side effects. There were days where I relapsed and ate poorly, with no signs of the dreaded side effects. then there were other days where i ate fine, and i saw passed fat. I had one really bad day, where i was so sick from this pill plus menstrual cramps, where I literally threw up and could do nothing for the whole day. This item is too new and not tested enough for people to waste their money on."
3,Not very impressed,"I bought this as an aid to help me loss those last 10 lbs. I lost about 25 lbs on my own, and then bought this product. I was not very impressed. It does make you have to *go* a lot/fast. Also, if you eat healthy -- this will not help you. Also, it blocks the good fat - from fish, etc."
2,Oily Bottom,"I researched Alli for a month until I bought Alli Starter pack. I read so many reviews about this product I started getting dizzy. I read so many reviews stating that if you eat fatty foods than you will have oil leaking from your anus or go #2 on yourself when passing gas.So, I made sure I ate foods with very little fat so I wouldn't have nasty side effects. Please understand that I only took Alli pills 3 times a day for only 3 weeks. First 2-3 days were fine, after that I was leaking oil like a old car LOL. Never used the bathroom on myself but there was oil.I decided to stop taking Alli and lose weight the old fashion way, workout and count calories without Alli.Please note that I'm not saying that Alli does not work in anyway. It is not for me, however they are countless people who have reached there weight loss goal by taking Alli with diet and exercise.I just didn't like the oily leakage and decided to stop taking the pill."
5,love this product!,I have lost 10 lbs in the first month using this product! You take this product and it will curb your hunger and you will have energy and not want to eat. Recommend this to all woman.
4,alli,"Alli seems to be a good over all weight loss,No side afects,and some weight loss, I do feel an all over better as they state....But I, think I would have to be on the diet longer for a better resulat outcome."
1,alli did nothing,My husband and I tried Alli for a month and found it did nothing but give us additional gas. Save your money.
3,Yikes,"Not to be too graphic, but the first few days I was using this product I saw colors beyond my imagination in the restroom. I haven't lost any weight despite following the instructions for diet and exercise which come with the product. However I am hopeful for the future, because I have been so disgusted by the results of my excessive bathroom trips that I no longer have any appetite."
1,I regret buying Alli!,"I bought Alli and was following the instructions on the package for a month. I had frequent embarassing gas discharges, diarrheas, couple ""leakages"" (one at important business meeting, the other one while stuck in traffic)and stomach cramps. After all this, I barely lost a pound! I really, really regret making this purchase!"
1,What treatment effects?,"I stopped taking this after I had only taken two pills. This product has had exactly the opposite effect on me. I am so bloated and distended it is painful. No gas, no discharge, no nothing. It feels like there is a basketball in my stomach. This caused me great constipation. I had to take laxatives to try and reverse the effect. Hopefully I can sell these things to someone who wants to try but doesn't want to pay full price. It's back to plain old diet and exercise."
1,Alli Weight-Loss,It was definately NOT worth my time or money. No results at all. Very disappointed.
1,bad for your health,"This product is bad for your health and bad for society's health. Despite the clever marketing we know that teens and folks with eating disorders will now be able to get this over the counter. In addition these pills have terrible side effects including ""oily discharge"" and ""diarreah."" The book they have even gives you a helpful tip to ""wear dark colored clothing"" when you first start using it. GROSS! They received a bitter pill award from prescription access litigation called the ""with allies like these who needs enemas?"" GROSS!"
5,keep a pair of draws and handywipes in your possession at all times!,"These pills definitely work. However, you never know when. It could be right after you eat a meal or it could be three days later while you're driving down the highway with no bathroom within 50 miles.The fat will surely come out with an orange, oily consistency. And the scent is far from the scent of a freshly picked rose.I have lost about 15 lbs in less than 2 months. But I attribute most of that weight loss to my increase in exercise and decrease in calorie intake. Alli helps a lot but don't expect it to be a miracle pill. You will not see positive results without proper diet and exercise. There is really no way around that."
1,I must have missed the part about the blood.,"I know there was a lot of literature with this product, I did not get through the literature before I found the product hazardous. (Two days.)I am only slightly overweight, but I have found pregnancy weight difficult to get rid of, so gave alli a try. Now I am quite unhappy, and mildly fearful, for having tried it.I can handle a little bit of gross farting and loose stools, but the spots of blood made me very nervous.I threw my pills away. Good luck everyone else."
1,Horrible side effects,It's not worth it. Abdominal pain. Uncontrollable gas. Oily discharge that is a mess and hard to wash off. And the close calls to pooping in your pants. Be near a bathroom 24/7. read the other 1 star reviews.
1,Not worth the money!!!,"I bought this product thinking it would be a great weight loss supplement but it sucked! You don't need to know all the horrible details but just know that I would never buy it again. I also stopped using it after 1 week (if that). I have already trashed the bottle, pills, etc. DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,Alli Weight-Loss Aid,Haven't really tried it yet. I am still doing some of my own reasearch on this.
2,"Don't need it, if you don't eat fatty foods!","I had purchased thinking it would work out well with an exercise routine I already had in place. I eat more than enough food, sweets and all, that I thought this would make some huge impact. Well...apparently I do not eat ""FATTY"" foods because nothing really happened with these for me. I already use the bathroom pretty regularly so that wasn't as overwhelming most people talked about. The only time this really bothered me was after I ate a decent amount of cheese. So really save your money if your diet isn't horrible."
2,Not enough side effects to stop me,"I'm not really overweight, just keep see-sawing back and forth, still trying to loose those last 10 pounds. I really need my mouth wired shut but I figured I'd try Alli cause it would keep me ""honest"" because of the side, er ""treatment"" effects as they call them in the brochure (yes, I did read it). The first time I took it, I did notice my stomach rumbling a bit, but that's about it. Actually, the best thing about it was I was never constipated, a problem I usually have.Unfortunately, the ""treatment effects"" were so minimal that it didn't stop me from eating and I actually gained a couple pounds. Go figure.Bottom line. Save your money. Eat less and exercise more. You can do that for free."
5,Awesome Alli,"I've been taking this... for some time now near to a year now... and I love this stuff!I can honestly say that these little pills work. I'm a housewife, and busy chasing three kids (Unfortunately, and I'll be 100% honest here) other then chasing the boys, I may get an hour or two of real exercise a week, and in making sure my boys eat right, I don't always get to monitor my fat intake and the like... but! These pills help with that!I've lost up to forty lbs total while using these (Pregnancy weight and then some!) and as of yet, have not had an explosive amount of fat pew forth from my back end like some people complain about.The trick of these things is, is the same as when teaching a kid to potty!When you get that UH OH feeling.. GO! If you feel like you need to fart, GO TO THE BATHROOM! It's not all that hard!The best part of these: You don get the jitters like you do from most 'diet' pills! These are just about the best things you can use!"
1,Very disappointed!,"When I began takin Alli I had just had a baby and had lost 10lbs through diet and excerise but I had hit a plateau and no matter what I did I couldn't lose anymore weight. After researching a ton of over the counter weight loss supplements I decided on Alli. I followed the low fat low calorie diet to a fault and I was working out for 30 mins to an hour a day. I only lost 4lbs of water weight on the first day and then nothing else. The side effects were not as bad as I thought they would be, and I think it's because I was following the low fat diet closely. Needless to say if there was anyway I could get my money back I would. I suggest you keep your money and try something else."
3,alli weight lost,I have been taking alli for almost 3weeks and lost 7 pounds so far i been following my program and its working well with no side affects yet i also work out 3 times a week i would recomend it if u are a decidated person but if u are not i wouldnt try it
5,Alli works,"I first lost over 25 Lbs. I was amazed. I still use it to keep my diet in check. Alli became unavailable in stores since the beginning of year, and the price went up a third. I was happy to,see I could get it at amazon."
3,web/weight loss,The pills are great IF you follow a low fat diet...However the cost was suposed to include online access and checkins with email reminders as of today 7/12/07 the online acct access for checkin info is still not wrking and there have been well over 500 posts from alli mbrs that would love to have an explanation..myself included///BUT again the pills work great if you are willing to wrk at your goals
4,Staying focused,With all the negative reviews about Alli treatment affects I decided to write my review. I have been taking Alli for 1 week and have not experienced any treatment effects at all. If anything I had to take a fiber supplement. I have reduced my fat intake. I eat what I want. I have increased my activity level to about 20 minutes a day at least 5 days a week. My calorie intake is about 1400 calories a day. This is a major improvement for me. So far I think I may have lost 2 pounds. Was I hoping for more results from Alli? Yes. Will I stop using Alli? No. We are warned that this is not a magic pill. I bought a 6 week supply. I will stick it out. I am hoping together with my motivation and Alli's help I can lose weight. In all I have about 50 pounds to lose. If I lose between 10-20 pounds within the 6 weeks I will continue to use Alli. Alright Amazon readers I will keep you posted.
4,Working Well So Far,"I've been taking the product for two weeks with no side effects. I have been following the diet plan as best I can, but probably not perfectly, and I have so far lost 6 pounds. I would recommend this product if you chose a low fat over a low carb diet plan. If you already eat a low fat diet, the pill may not help. If you are a low carb plan, you may run the risk of experiencing the side effects."
3,side affects exaggerated,"I have taken the whole bottle of Alli now...can't say I've lost weight, but had have not experienced any side affects that you are warned of. Keep in mind that if 1% of people tested experience side affects of any medication, there has to be a warning about ""possible"" side affects.I only need to lose around 7 lbs. Will probably try another bottle before giving up."
1,"Supports, just not there","I want to say this has helped me in my weight loss but I honestly can't.Why?1) the website for me is not fully running, I can sign on but that is as far as I can go, no message boards, no nothing, cant seem to connect with the journal, (yes i have called and complained but it has been no help. (the problem is not on my end for i have checked the web site from home and work and even from my boyfriends place..and still the same problems)2) as I am being careful with what I am eating I have not had any bad side effects no runs, no bad gas, no accidents or need of changing clothing...no nothing.What it has done for me in a little over a week has made me be more careful in choosing what I eat and snack on ie more veggies and fruits less fried foods, and even easing up on bread. Will keep using this till my supply runs out, hopefully there is some weight loss, and then decide if I will continue using this...."
3,"works(blocking fat), but not losing anything yet.","This product does seem to work at blocking fat-I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and have'nt lost any weight yet. And yes, you do have embarrassing gas, with oily discharge. I'll give it a few more weeks to know if it's helping to lose weight. I'd say try it for yourself. At least your body won't absorb so much fat-it might help clear up people's arteries?"
2,Not A Good Candidate For This Drug?,I am on a low fat diet. I shoot for 1200-1500 calories per day. I exercise 3x per week. 10 miles on an exercise bike. I lose about a pound every week and a half. I hoped this would help kick the weight loss up a notch. But since I am already 1)watching calories 2)exercising 3)eating low fat. I guess I'm just not a good candidate...no noticable results for me. I wish the rest of you luck! I am just giving it 2 stars. I AM thrilled that the FDA has approved this for OTC purchase!
5,useful for constipation too,Ally helped me with a terrible constipation I got due to stress. I don't know if it does much for weight loss. But it certainly helps with constipation. Alli and a stull softener have solved my problem.
3,Works great,Works great. I have lost 40 pounds but completely overpriced when it was out of stock all over the country. they took complete advantage of people that didnt want to go without it!
1,save your money!,"OMG! what a nightmare! Don't waste your money folks. I am serious. This item is more trouble than it's worth. Just suck it up and eat healthy, start a light exercise program and do it on your own!"
3,I think it's helped,"I began taking Alli 01/10/08. During that time I have had no side effects, as a matter of fact i've had the opposite (constipation). My starting weight was 167lbs, as of today, 01/25/08 I weigh 160lbs. I lost 6lbs in the first week, and 1 in the 2nd. I do karate twice a week, and walking about 4 days a week at work. i have stuck to a diet of no more than 1200 calories (give or take) so my results may have a lot to do with these two factors. i have also been taking the pills wrong. i've been taking them 30mins before a meal, and not with the meal. I just began taking them with the meal yesterday. i will write and updated review after two more weeks."
2,"For Me, An Agonizing Way To Loose Weight","I have to ask: Has anyone ever bought this product a 2nd time? Not me, anyway.... I bought into this product because of all the media hype it received. After two weeks of agony, I threw in the towel. It wasn't about soiling my paints; I never had ""that"" problem. My problem was ""pain"" every time I had to potty. It was like passing barbed wire! I have tried other products with mixed success: I tried Relacore and actually lost 20 pounds within 6 months but afterwards it seemed to loose it's effect on me. I'm now trying Hydroxycut and after 2 weeks I have lost 3 pounds with no bad side effects. Good luck!"
4,"In cyberspace, no one knows you're a dog","A fun read, sometimes hilarious (the guy who wanted him to put a paper bag over his head), sometimes scary (the cat fights that go on in the CD chatrooms), and occasionally touching (the author's frustration with his life and loves). A major theme of the book is the isolation and miscommunication that goes on over the Internet... and as I type this, I note, on the Amazon page, that I am being invited to search for ""Diary Queen"" restaurants in North Carolina... Anyhow, I recommend this to anyone looking for a glimpse into a rarely-seen world of offbeat sexuality. Breezy style (no doubt the product of his five years at Hahvahd!) and never boring."
4,Mid-Life Gender Crisis,"More of a transvestite than a drag queen, the author ventures into the world of femininity in the hopes of capturing the ever elusive "" All Man."" Her search for cosmetics, beauty, men and truth are all too comical and disturbing at turns. With Gay Men as with Women, beauty and viability are one and the same same and the shelf life of which expires all too soon. Does one accept a certain loneliness and solitude with grace or go down fighting? Does the tyranny of beauty rule absolutely or are there utopias beyond? Even more entertaining than the notions of gender and beauty are the fluid sexuality of men who will do anything to have sex without being labeled gay. The willingness of her men to believe that they are straight and to hold onto their rigidly defined sexuality is just as revealing as the gay man who goes to any length to avoid being alone."
3,"Functional, but","There just O.K. Nice to look at. The right boot went on really hard for several wears! Now it is not so bad, at least I do not have to fight with it to get it on.They do not breath, wish I knew before I bought them!! I wear 2 pairs of tall 100% RailRoad socks, they get soaked after 2 hours of riding. Don't forget to bring extra pairs of socks when you go riding or on a trip!!!!! Steel toes are the way to go! Basically there just O.K. They will not be very warm in the really cold weather!!!!!!!!"

4,Just What I Wanted,I was looking for reasonably priced quality sunglasses that wrapped around enough to have the lens protect my peripheral vision. I got just what I wanted.
4,Good Stuff,When i got it i just heat repeat on over half the songs of the record and didn't take it out for 2 weeks. That's alot these days. I'm pretty picky.
5,Love it!!!,I have found this scale to be consistant with it's readout and it appears to measure the same as my doctor's manual scale. So I feel that it is reliable and accurate.I love the style of it since it has a modern feel to it and isn't obtrusive to the eye. The transparent glass allows for it to blend in with my flooring so it doesn't take away from the esthetics of my decor.
1,Deserves a 0,"I got this as a gift and my-oh-my what a pain in the butt this scale was. Since opening the box, this scale never worked right. First, the display is rather small and my wife and I had a hard time reading the numbers off this scale without crouching down. secondly, every time we step on the scale, it gives us a different weight! i mean, the sole purpose of this device is to weigh things and it can't even do that right, which is rather troubling. i now keep this scale where it deserves to stay- the trash."
5,One I keep coming back to,"In this age of playlists, it's a rare album that can compete intact for more than a replay or two. Maybe it's just that it strikes a chord with me, but Geronimo is on the short list of albums I never seem to tire of listening to. To list a few others -- Astral Weeks, Blood on the Tracks, Sticky Fingers, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, Dark Side of the Moon, The Joshua Tree, Red Dirt Girl, Remain in Light -- I'm surprised Shannon McNalley isn't better known."

If already have two or more albulms ; libertad & unplugged, and any LA LEY albulm before the 1995 cd ""INVISIBLE"" then you owe it to yourself to buy this albulm.La Ley & Mana....damn they need to tour together !LOVE PEACE LIBERTY"
4,Great watch!,Excellent watch!Very nice!Great for everyday use or special ocasions.I don't know why Amazon is not an autorized dealer from Tissot watches.
4,"great ,affordable watch","Terrific watch , good looking ,truly water resistant and keeps good but not perfect time. Has the look and feel of a more expensive watch. BE CAREFUL because Tissot doesnt warranty watches sold on the net."
4,"Good, but faulty","Love the watch, it looks great, but ultimately I've had the below problems with it-No instruction manual included from Amazon, included a brochure in place of it and Amazon told me to download manual off the internet-Chrono's dont work properly-Date function loses days randomly-After 2 months use cannot wind date onto correct date.I've had problems with Amazon with the warranty. Fortunately they are now prepared to honour the warranty.I am going to get the watch replaced by them because it is a very nice looking watch."
2,Not what expected,This product is a perfect size for those who live in apartments. However once you have been on the machine for over 25 minutes it starts to make noises. It is not worth the price and I would not recommend this product to friends.
4,Air Hogs Counterstrike Air Rocket Fun for All Ages,"My 8 year old son loves this gift he received at Christmas. His little sister enjoys it too. The first time they used it outside I heard the screams of excitement and my husband said, ""You really need to come out here and see how high this thing can go."" It's unbelievable and it's so much fun to watch the kids play with it. The only thing I wish is that they sold ""replacement rockets"" for this item.We have had it for 6 months and it still works, however, if there was a problem I'm not sure the company would be much help. I tried to reach the company to purchase another Counterstrike Air Rocket and they were not very receptive. It's a UK company, so they told me to email the US subsidiary and that was a bust. Then I found it on Amazon!!"
5,Awesome,This toy is really fun. My 11 year old son enjoys shooting it up. It goes so high that it attracts plenty of attention in the neighborhood. Everyone likes watching how high it goes!
2,Two Stars out of respect for the past.,"No one has wanted even to hear Sondheim's writing of late, and you surely do NOT want to hear him sing. I loved his interviews where he'd play and sing in an insturctional mode. All composers are forgiven for that. The man is brilliant. But singing for real? Uh-uh."
1,ONE word to describe this CD,PAINFUL!!!!! whoever decided to release this didn't listen to it...or didn't wanna hurt sondheim's feelings!! OUCH!!! this one HURTS A LOT!!!! i'm gonna go take some major pain pills now! i would have given this CD ZERO stars if it let me!
3,Sondheim sings,"They say writers cant really read their own writing...well composer really cant sing their tunesThis is a collection of Stephen Sondheim demos from shows Follies, Company, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Anyone can Whistle and A Little Night Music. Some non classic tunes with a few chestnuts we all rememberIt is worth it? To listen to composer Sondheim singing his showtunes digitally remastered for this CD. In my opinion, Sondheim can write wonderful pieces of music, but can't sing them.So would I recommend it to a broadway fan? SURE. But for the common person, this is a composer's Golden Turkey. The last cut on the CD says it all, SEND IN THE CLOWNSBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
5,There is a God!,"...and, as a very accurate member of Finishing The Chat promptly pointed out, he's publishing his demos!"
4,A Treasure!,"What a great treasure it is to hear Mr. Sondheim sing these great songs, although I'm disapointed they included more from Anyone Can Whistle and his unproduced shows than his more popular ones, they are still great. I'm exited to see the next edition of this series."
1,"Sonheim Sings, Vol.1:1962-72","No one is a bigger Sondheim fan than I am, so when I heard that he was releasing a CD of his own recordings, I rushed to buy it. However, whoever convinced him to market this product ought to have to listen to it. The choices of songs could not be worse, especially the first 10 cuts. Not only are the selections unworthy, but Sondheim's flat renditions bring nothing new to understanding his meaning. The only cut that lingers in my memory is ""Marry Me A Little"". Does he plan on releasing Vols. 2,3, and 4, one for every decade of his career? If so, his ego is larger than earth can bear. Give me the cast albums anyday."
5,Remember these things/Paul Harvey,"I have found that back in 1952, Paul Harvey had todays problems already pegged.He holds back nothing and it is a worth while readDemocrat or Republican."
2,freestyle is not good enough!!!,"All I have to say is lil flip is a pretty good freestyler, but that aint nothing if you dont have the right beats to go with the lyrics...Personnally when I hear that bunk as... beat you dont want to hear the rest, so i think the cd can be better!!!!"
3,Other people are weak,"Lil flip is tight. His flows are silly and he makes me laugh. He says some tight stuff and he has talent. Some of his beats are plain weak. But if he just came with some stronger beats he would be tight. The people he has on his cd are weak at times. He has some sorry little kid on there and some people who just cant flow. I know you need to stay true to your people but if they (stink)they (stink). Lil flip has some weak cuts but the tight ones are an shining example of his talent. You like the south, pick this up."
4,Off tha chain,"Good solid album, I can do dat, has gotten a lot of spin....but other tracks are as good if not better. If you like Lil Flip, I gotta recommend the album Southern Slang by D.O.W.N., this has Lil Flip on track called DOWN and tha Clover, which really displays this artists versatility....the Album Southern Slang merits 5 stars and Flip's outstanding."
4,Why!,"LIL Flip is pretty good rap artist, but I wonder if Leprechaun was more commercially motivated. If you have a winner you will know, unless you are preoccupied with quantity instead of quality."
5,Best Hair of the Dog yet,"This album shows great growth from the band's previous releases. The additions of Larry Packer on fiddle and Eric Finn on electric guitar have added much depth to the former trio's sound. The great selection of songs and wonderful lead vocals by Mike DeAngelis, John Haggerty and Rick Bedrosian have kept this CD in my car CD player since it's release last month. I dare you to try to not sing along! Almost as good as seeing them perform live."
4,Good phone for a good price,"We've had problems with other cordless phones, but so far this one has none of them. Interference from the microwave, disconnecting and losing their charge if you set them down at all ungently, random static issues (probably from EMI or RFI). That's how our old phone was. This one works great. The only thing that's at all annoying is that everytime I pick up the handset, I hit the volume button - it's just in the wrong place, but that's not a big deal as it's simple to adjust."
1,very lightweight and not practical,"There's a reason it's this cheap. It's just not a great phone. Not a lot of thought went into its design. For example, it has caller ID and you can scroll through the numbers. But you can't actually call them. Because the phone doesn't realize that most people have to use a 1 when dialing any area code now. Even my previous phone did that."
4,"Excellent, but had day of week problem","The telephone and answering system have all the features we could ever want. However, the day of the week would not advance (always on Tuesday for example). Homeand beyond was extremely helpful and we are about to receive a replacement. I highly recommend homeandbeyond."
2,POOR Quality!,"Poor quality from a NEW product. I tried and tried to resolve the issue with Amazon and could never find a phone number on the website to call or e-mail address to contact them. Now, I am upset so I will review the product instead. The third tape, Rio Bravo kept breaking down and we completly missed several very important scenes. Again, very poor quality."
5,Christmas Gift,"Got it for my soon to be stepfather in law. He likes it. Westerns and old movies are his thing. So for the price, I couldn't pass it up."
5,A Birthday gift to my oldest Brother,A gift given to my oldest Brother who likes the Old Westerns. I hope he has enjoyed watching this CD collection. I am sure the CD is wonderful.
5,Great John Wayne Westerns,"If you are a John Wayne fan like me, you must buy this fourpack! I have always John Wayne westerns and here are 4 great movies. A definite must have for those who love westerns!"
2,Never got the package.,"Don't have a review on product,because I never got the package in the mail. If and when I get the package, I will be glad to revise my review."
3,john wayne greatest clasic fims,The Movies are great but one side of the DVD would not read or skip/freaze in the middle of the movie.
5,TMC Classic Filmes Collection: John Wayne Westerns.,Very pleased with the addition to my classic movies. Received it quickly. Packaged safely and the movies were as I had expected. Thank you. Will order more classic movies.
2,Poor Quality!,"To fans of westerns, this DVD is disappointing. The quality of the picture is poor as well as the volume."
5,John Wayne movie collection.,My family really liked the collection of John Wayne movies by TCM. They were the favorite ones included in the collection and a good reproduction of them.
4,Double sided DVD's,"I recently started my John Wayne DVD collection and rely a lot on the reviews provided by previous buyers. I'm not so much looking for reviews of the movies, the plot lines, or the actors. I'm looking for information about the technical quality of the DVD production; is it a quality copy or a bad dub; is the video and sound good or poor; are there worthy extras like scene selection or directors comments. I recently discovered the issue with regions and having the appropriate DVD player by reading these reviews.In this particular instance, the video and sound quality is good; these seem to be good copies of the original movies; no extras. My only issue is the extra small print on the DVD ring labeling the movie titles. My eyes aren't as good as they used to be. Because the DVD's are double-sided there's no big label or graphics to identify them, just the very small center ring. So, I recommend the DVD set - and a magnifying glass."
4,Great Pack of John Wayne's Work.,"This collection of John Wayne western's from Turner Classic Movies is very representative of ""The Duke's"" work. Three of the films are in ""living color"" (""Fort Apache"" is in beautiful black and white.)The site says there are no ""extra's"", but that is not quite true. ""The Cowboy's"" offered a discussion with the director and various surviving cast members. ""The Searchers"" contained a commentary track from Peter Bogdanovich along with an intro by Patrick Wayne. All of the films contained the original trailer.While this was a tad disappointing compared to some other TCM collections which offer trailer, newsreel, short subject and a cartoon, there's nothing to complain about with this offering."
5,a great collection,"I bought this to give to my dad, but of course I had to watch it first to ensure it played well. I may buy another, just for my collection"
4,Great up close detail. A quality replica.,"We purchased this as a center piece for our living room. It looks quite nice. Up close you can see all the origional detail.Great quality replica, although a little pricey."
3,Simple Facts about Evergreens,"This book is a true encyclopedia of Evergreen Trees and Shrubs. Unfortunately, it has very little information on gardening or transplanting Evergreen Trees, although ""Successfull Gardening"" is part of the book title. Additionally it makes no mention of the Pine trees most common in the Rocky Mountain region, the Lodgepole Pine, and no mention of the costly pest, the Pine Beetle, which are two of the reasons I purchased this book."
3,The Hardy Boys in New Mexico.,"This book is nothing special, but not bad either. The Hardys are asked to investigate a disappearing, and end up disappearing into a desert wilderness themselves."
2,Very disappointed,"I like this version of the Bible, so I wanted the audio CD version. I went to the publisher's website and listened to an audio sample, which was nice and slow (and relaxing), so, I decided to order it.After receiving it and listening to it most of this Bible is NOT like the audio sample on the website, the audio seems to be sped up and is NOT relaxing to listen to.The Bible version is great, but the audio quality is lacking for the reason mention above. Most audio Bibles I've listened to are similar to this one in that the CD sounds like the reader is speed reading."
2,"Looks like it would be interesting, but it's in French...","I can't read French. This book may have photographs (?), but it would be maddening to try to digest without text. I'll wait to buy the English version, IF that's forthcoming."
5,Excellent Sound and Intonation,"These strings produce a clear sound with little unwanted bass noise. The intonation of the regular G string is great! Next time, I am going to try the extra hard tension to see if response time is even faster. They sound wonderful on a very inexpensive guitar, so I'm eager to try them on my better one."
5,have u heard,all the songs on this cd are great. but the Cenizas Y Fuegosets it off because it is a great ballad. And really recommend it.
4,Good Clock,"If you are looking for a clock, go with this one! The time is so big and i love the aroma therapy. I recommend this clock to everyone who has stress! and who needs new clock. I strongly urge you to buy this, you won't regret it."
4,Motivational video,"This is a Great video. It shows some older footage, but if this video doesn't get you standing at attention and marching through your house calling out cadence, than you have not served in the armed forces."
5,HONOR AND GLORY,SHOULD BE SEEN BY ALL FAMILIES FOR INSIGHT INTO WHAT WE DO AND WHY WE DO IT IN HONOR OF THOSE WHO SERVE
3,Outdated - not the authors fault,"I made a typical mistake of most people buying computer related books; forgot to check the publish date. This book was probably great in 1997 but in 1999-2000 almost all of the software used as examples have been updated. The content seemed stable and the author quite knowledgeable. As a previous customer stated, it's probably better to just seek out literature that is relevant to the program being used than a book that tries to ""cover it all""."
1,My students always complain,"As an author in the process of writing a new textbook on FreeHand for Delmar Publishing (due out in 10/99 called ""Digital Drawing: Print & Web Graphics with FreeHand""), I have to say that Macromedia's offering is one of the large reasons I am writing the book. My students universally hate this book -- ""dry""; ""boring""; ""confusing"" are typical comments. The dry tutorial style, lockstep method, coupled with a lack of practical industry tips and techniques are usually the main reasons given."
3,"A nice look at simple Italian Life, but writing style is often not simple at all","While I enjoyed this book and it's look into a small Italian village, I often felt the author fell in love with her prose - sometimes an apple is an apple and it isn't a ruby fruit of the earth -- the author too often explained something in delicate, intricate prose instead of leaving some of the paragraphs to flow more easily -Perhaps if I was used to her style, I would have breezed through this story -- sadly, I looked forward to the end of this book, so I could start another -The book includes Q & A with the author, and I wish I had not read the passages. The answers provided by the author seem to show us that the elegant prose is only a reflection of the author's view of herself.This may be fine for some people, but I'm just a regular person living a few days in Italy through someone else's eyes....and the hope is, I guess, that those eyes would be of another regular person -Sadly -- this isn't the author for that."
2,Too much food talk,"I read the previous novel A Thousand Days in Venice and enjoyed it very much. This book was not the same at all. Lots of talk about food, characters we don't care much about and travel to places that never get fleshed out. Barely got through this one."
3,Bella Tuscany,"Not finished reading this book yet. Early pages less about experiences in Tuscany than about personal feelings which could be about anywhere, 1/3 of the way starting to involve life in Tuscany."
4,A Story of life,"This is definitely an interesting book about a couple living in Tuscany. Moving from their beloved Venice they are embraced by the locals of Tuscany and welcomed into the community. They are befriended by an elder there and shown the local customs and the old ways of the times. They make new friends, learn more about each other and delve headlong into their new life.This is the story of a couple, a insight into Italian food with recipes given, and a great look into life in Tuscany. We even have some of the book written in Italian with what is being said shown, great way to pick up a few phrases. I did not read the previous work of this author, ""A Thousand Days in Venice,"" however I found this work to be a different read, to me not the norm, but yet quite compelling and interesting.I believe to sum it up, this is a story of life, love and learning about themselves, others and the world they live in.Shirley Johnson"
1,Horrible!,"This album is not worth it. I took my time and listened to all the songs it had, and they just weren't all that good. The music was strange, and not at all catchy. The tunes were not popular. I would say Ian Van Dahl's a much better artist for this kind of music, not Lasgo."
3,Lasgo,"I'm not normally a fan of Euro vocal trance but this is quite good for the genre.Obviously, the first song ""Surrender"" is a big hit, probably the best on the album, and has already appeared on Ministry of Sound's definitive 2005 double-disc. But the rest of the songs are similar.It gets a little too similar though after awhile. 13 songs with all female vocalists. Not a whole lot of instrumentals, which is too bad because because the beats are quite good, upbeat and fun. Maybe they could've used a male voice here and there to break it up a bit?Overall though, it's hard to not like this group. They're catchy fun and upbeat - it's sort of like Abba for the modern times. Decent stuff."
3,Lasgo 's spectrum music might not last !!,"I just listened to Lasgo's Far away and i would say that from my opinion this album has too much of spectrum on sound analyzing and too much time has been spent for the graphical sounds espects.The vocals of Lasgo still remained very stable thought maybe the previous album had more of a Lasgo presence.You could follow the music for this one but one may be lost for a while because Lasgo is just not there,there is so much of graphical sound avaliable.Anyway Lasgo did a good job in certain espects but not on her rival IAN VAN DAHL ..IAN IS STILL THERE WITH YOU AND WITHIN YOU !! AND TAKES YOU THREW !"
1,Horrible......don't waste your money,"I was very impressed with their first album, almost every song was good, but this album was not worth purchasing to me. Ian Van Dahl recently came out with their second album which is better than the first, so I thought Lasgo's 2nd album would be just as great, but I was very disappointed with this album. The only really good song on it was Surrender."
5,A simply beautiful work that touches all emotions.,"In Last Lovers, an American expatriate-businessman turnedstreet artist meets, by accident, an ingenuous, blind,Parisian spinster and a beautiful relationshipensues. More than just an exploration of these twodistinct lives, Last Lovers peers into the Byzantinemysteries of love and relationships. In a clear andunencumbered voice, William Wharton tells how these twopeople find joy, beauty, and clarity in lives scarredby sorrows and misfortunes. A touching novel that willeffect every emotion and leave each reader changed."
5,A great book!,"I received Angel Flight as a Christmas present and I've got to say this is one book that I read immediately and enjoyed every page! The characters were fascinating and I enjoyed the interplay between the heroine, Desiree, and the anti-heroine, Susanna. The hero, Ben, was amazing and the depth of his struggle touched me deeply. If you haven't read this book, buy it now. You won't be sorry and I thank my friend for sending me a copy."
5,Beatiful & Very Attractive to Hummers,"I have several glass Hummingbird Feeders and this is one of their favorites. They are attracted by the color and I've had as many as 7 Hummers feeding at one time at this feeder. They can sit and feed and hang out too, which they often do. It's easy to clean with a brush and the bottom comes apart for simple, quick, and thorough cleaning. I have two."
4,Nice Feeder...,"Just be careful when washing it not to break the glass. Replacement glass bottles are available from the mfg. but I've found it's less expensive to just buy a whole new unit online. Don't use hot or boiling water when cleaning it, warm tap water is ok. It will crack. Color will fade over time, but that's no big deal. Mix water to sugar at 4 parts water to 1 part sugar (i.e. 1/4 cup sugar to one cup water). Never put hot solution in your feeder, cool to room temp first. Happy Hummer feeding."
5,Beautiful!,"This feeder was sent as a gift and arrived on time and is just beautiful! Now, lets just hope the color attracts lots of hummers!The quality of construction is excellent."
4,You get what you pay for,The sounds quality is what you expect from JBL. It is crystal clear. The only problem that I had with this system is that the power was a little underwhelming. I could barely hear/feel the bass.
4,Perfect for listening to music on computer!,"Son was listening to downloaded music on little computer speakers. Nice, complex sound, and doesn't distort when you turn it up! Really great sound in his bedroom. Maybe not for a stereo buff, but perfect for a teenager!"
5,Great Speakers,"These speakers are great. They will honestly make your music sound better. Also, they are quite small and don't take up much space. The volume touch buttons allow you to easily control the volume and also allow for a wide range of volume (plus they are fun to touch). I'm not very knowledgable in the world of speakers, but I did do a fair amount of research before buying these, and I'm definitely not the only one who thinks they're worthwhile. I live with three other people and we all have them, if that's any incentive. I highly recommend them!"
5,Great Sound,This is my second purchase of these speakers.They provide great sound especially for the price.My kids use them with their computers and Ipods.I recommend them to everyone.
2,"Cool looking, cruddy sounding...","These are certainly, um, UNIQUE-looking.Unfortunately their actual performance leaves a lot to be desired, especially if you listen to any real music not just gaming sounds.I'd strongly recommend the more conventional looking designs by Logitech like the excellent z-2300 instead. What's the old saw, ""beauty is as beauty does?""At the very least, buy it from someplace with an easy return policy because you may well need it!I supposed I'd buy as a gift...for my 8 year old nephew perhaps."
2,Wasted Money,I bought my daughter these speakers for Christmas. She liked how they looked. We have tried everything we know to do to get rid of the static. Her speakers that we got rid of sound much better. Too bad we threw them away! Two stars for the looks!
5,Great Product,I have read all the other reviews for this product and find them to be good. The only thing I did not see is the fact that you can split the connection to the system with a simple head phone splitter from radio shack. Don't worry if both audio inputs are on at the same time the thing won't blow up.This just makes it easier to hook up multiple items to the audio system.
2,Could have been a contender,"Recieved these speakers last week. At first glance, they are esthetically pleasing. Operations and hookup is fairly simply,no different than any other pc speakers you have seen before.When I tested them out for the first time,the disappointment began to set in. The sound was barely audible no matter what options or settings I choose.At first I thought the problem might be my soundcard,but after testing two other speaker systems on my PC it was my conclusion that the speakers were definately at fault.Also,I would like to add that the volume adjustment buttons on the actual speaker seemed as if they were stuck. No amount of pressing would adjust the volume whatsoever.So I am now in the process of returning these for a refund and continue the search for a good set of speakers to complete my system,these obviously will not do the job.Sad.I gave 2 stars for ease of setup and looks, I just wished the preformace would have been just as good."
4,Speaker Placement,"Speaker placement made the difference between this system sounding very disappointing and very good. I'm a jazz bassist, so I'm relatively particular about sound. When I first got these speakers, I put the woofer on my desk and the tweeters up on a shelf about 5 feet off the ground. There was almost no midrange at all, and the highs were tinny and sharp. Eventually I put the woofer under my desk and the tweeters on the floor on either side, and now they sound fabulous! My roommate, a Julliard trumpet player, said they have ""good depth of sound,"" and I would have to agree. Speaker placement fixed the EQ issues, and they now sound great with a flat EQ. Speaker placement is a critical issue with a system like this. Every room is different, so make sure to experiment with it if you get a set."
2,Very Disappointed - NO MIDS!!,"Hello to all from a professional musician. I was looking forward to receiving these speakers so my music would sound fuller and more detailed. Many people reviewing the product on Amazon mention the ""powerful bass"" and ""crisp highs."" Yes, these speakers have both, but there are practically NO MIDS! This is a *big* problem. It makes nearly everything sound empty and devoid of substance. Bottom line is, if you're looking to hear music sound good, KEEP LOOKING! These speakers may be appropriate for some applications, but they're not for the music enthusiast. It may be the case that many speakers in this price range sound like this - you might have to spend a bit more.Just trying to help. Good luck."
4,"Small Stylish Package, Big Decent Sound","I saw these speakers on the show floor at MacWorld and wanted them right away. I liked the design esthetic, plus I could actually hear them which is a bit of a miracle at a trade show.They're definitely not audiophile quality, but for anyone who cares about bang for the buck AND look and feel these speakers will serve quite well. They give a nice rich sound for both music and game play plus they look really cool.The only thing I'd change would be to make the downward firing LEDs brighter."
3,"look and sound great, but arent loud at all","these speakers look amazing and sound clear as a bell, ive heard things in songs ive never heard before with these speakers, but if you want to blast music these speakers are not for you, they start distorting a whole lot when you turn it up"
5,I love It!,I love everything about it! it works great! Looks cool to! I am actually using it for my TV! Work great for stereo sound! I would recomend buying one to everyone!
5,Excellent Speakers for the Price,"To be honest, I was surprised at the sound quality of this system, given the price. I have it hooked up to my XM satellite radio, and the sound is crystal clear. If you are looking for something for a small room, or at work, I would highly recommend this system, as sound quality is great, and it can easily fill up a small space with sound."
3,"Awesome, except that..................","Although these speakers are truly amazing, the ""touch"" response on the sattlelite speakers gets stuck and usually not the volume you want/need. No way to fix it, just one of the drawbacks of a less expensive but great sounding speaker system for your Port. DVD or MP3 players."
3,Small and LOUD!!,"I don't know where the guys with the negative reviews got the small sound from, I seen these at a local mom and pop shop and it was blastin out X-Men III with the quality of a home theater system. I was hooked, just glad I saw them here since they are about 20 bucks cheaper :) If you have a good tricked out rig for gaming these speakers are the bomb! I never turned my old speakers off so the power switch where it is isnt a problem for me."
1,what planet are we on,"#1 Very little power. Hooked up to my ipod through the headphone jack with the volume maxed on both you can't make out much from across the room.#2 My set picks up a constant radio signal very faintly, so I have Hot 97 playing all the time. When I'm playing a podcast from my ipod I can still hear that radio underneath it. Not cool.#3 Very difficult to access the power button (hidden in the back between two plugs). Esentially impossible if you hide the large subwoofer on the floor. JBL must have stock in an electric company.#4 Small bright lights on the bottom of the speakers that you can't disable. Maybe that's a bonus for somebody.I haven't really tried too many mini computer speakers. I use powered edirol monitors for my computer, so perhaps these JBLs are good for what they are, but man, they still suck."
4,Pretty Pleased,Not at all bad for the price. Perfect for the office or desk computer. The bass sounds great and the volume controls are very easy.
2,Faulty Volume Button,"Unfortunately, I didn't heed the warnings of some of the other disappointed reviewers. When my speakers arrived, I excitedly unpacked them and set them up. After many attempts, I could not get the ""touch sensitive"" volume buttons to react at all. This seems to be a very poor design as many others have had this same issue. Hence, I had to return these speakers.I did give the speakers two stars instead of one based on the cool design and nice bass. The midrange is a bit weak though and not up to an audiophile's standards. Bottom line - your money would be better spent on something else."
4,Best value on the planet??,"When I first heard these speakers, I was blown away. Simply the best quality sound I have ever heard at a price below $200.The modern design makes them pleasant to look at, and everyone that sees and/or hears them has positive things to say. I couldn't be happier with the purchase."
3,meh.,"I rarely stop reading a book. I just can't get into this one....I'm not sure why, I just don't like this book."
5,Great,"I read this a while ago, but I loved it. I did not find the storylines annoying as some o the other reviewers did. Liked it so much, I passed it on to the other readers in the family."
1,Not Good,This book involved far too many technical terms for it to be truly enjoyable. The multiple story lines were confusing and even the resolution was unsatisfactory. I surely would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Stealing with Style,"Not only is ""Stealing with Style"" a good mystery, it is also a great antiques guide! Each chapter begins with a Q&A about a particular type of antique, and the response. A very enjoyable read!! And, a good learning experience!"
5,Meet a new 'best' friend...,"Reading STEALING WITH STYLE is like sitting down with a new best friend. The main character, Sterling Glass (don't let the name fool you), is such a likeable, interesting person. I found myself wishing we could spend more time together. I'm guessing this book is our introduction to Sterling, and that there will be more chances to develop the friendship."
3,Slow read,"I am always looking for a new character who I will be able to meet in future adventures. Perhaps another Carlotta Carlyle or a Stephanie Plum. I found Sterling Glass delightful, but the book itself was a bit slow."
4,good read,"I bought this book for my mom who loves antiques and watching Antique Road Show. She read it quickly and asked for the sequal for her birthday! She said it was light reading, but very good. She enjoyed the plot with the main character having to travel from VA to NY to evaluate antiquities in different locations. She also enjoyed how each chapter opened with a ""Dear Abby"" style question about antiques."
2,Not as promised,"After reading the other reviews - I thought ""This book is for me!"" - but I was sorely disappointed and I noticed (after the fact of spending the hard cover price), that all the five-star reviews were from people in Virgina, NC or Texas - so maybe Ms. Jenkin's fan base checked in to help her sell her book? There was also too much coincidence in the fact that the lead character runs into another character in 3 spots in one day in Manhattan - not a likely scenario - it's a big city!"
2,Not bad,I picked up this book because I found the cover appealing. Although it wasn't the worst book I've ever read I really can't recommend it highly. Not awful but not great either.
1,Rubbish,"I couldn't put this book down either as I waited for something - anything - to happen to make it worth the $25+ I spent on this dribble. I finally gave up, chalked it up to experience, and tossed the book in the charity pile. Save your time and money - life's too short to waste it on Stealing with Style."
4,"Tasteful, refined, late-career effort","Milt's vibes are as tasteful as ever, playing plenty of his trademark fast bop runs that gently nudge yet never strain the boundaries of each tune. John Clayton plays creative bass lines that improvise melodically along with him on some of the tunes. A lot of sweet ballads, most with lush string arrangements that are complementary, but occasionally distracting. A couple of faster tunes vary the pace. Very pleasant, though lacking enough edge for some listeners."
3,Get what you pay for.,It was one of the cheaper white board out there. The first time I used it with the dry erase pen it comes with the markings did not easily erase. After three or four uses I've had to use marker board cleaner to get the markings to come off. After a week the board looked like I'd had used it for two or three seasons. Not very happy with this purchase.
3,"OK, but not perfect","Great except why is velcro on pen, but not on board? What is the point? What do I stick it to?"
5,Nice Board,This item was ordered by my husband and he likes it alot. It has really helped the girls on the basketball team to understand the plays better.
5,B' Ball Clip Board,"Received the product ahead of schedule, and the quality is above expectations. Very sturdy, with a good marker."
4,Classic children's book,"A fine children's book of the early 1960s era. Simple, easy illustration, good story line with lesson about finding your ""comfort place"". My children enjoyed it as much as I."
5,Gospel Finger-style Guitarist Inspired,"Richard's music is inspired by the Holy Spirit and not just a fancy combination of left hand cords and right hand picking. When he plays in churches, people respond spiritually. If you want some great music to ""gear down"" from the rat race, just listen to this CD."
3,Santorini Plays,"So sorry the other reviewer could not work his DVD. I took a chance hoping to get lucky and i did. The scenery and photography is beautiful. There is just enough information to leave you wanting a bit more, not enough to bore you. I think it gives well rounded information to help the first time Santorini visitor plan her day or two, with an easy to navigate menu.On the down side, the narrator has an annoying know-it-all tone and the music is non-stop irritating."
5,Swans of Avon - When Heaven Falls,"Even better than the Mission, Bauhaus, and Sisters of Mercy. Fantastic musicians and beautiful, yet haunting, music. I am hooked!"
3,"good pump, but with limitations","This pump is handy, easily moved around, pumps down to 3/16"", but cannot be left to work as needed as water rises or falls. It should not be left to run when there is no more water to pump."
2,a profound disappointment,"I wish I could impute a more positive rating, but I cannot find the wherewithal. The content of this putatively ""absurdist"" collection was such as my twin three-year-olds could readily pen without a moment's preparation. Noting that Kharms was among the authors represented, I expect to at least see something of the quality of his ""The Old Woman,"" but I did not. It seemed as if the anthologists sought high and low for the poorest, leanest possible representation of every participating author. Vvesensky (yes, that's the proper spelling) was a waste of paper. I didn't even bother to delve into the other three or four ""writers.""I assigned two stars because the typography was clean and the grammar of the translation was excellent."
4,Pleasantly pleased,Works as described. The wireless connect software that came with adapter is less than user friendly. The XP Pro wireless software works much better.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this in an effort to resurrect an older Dell laptop for my elderly mother to use wirelessly instead of her desktop. I never could get it to work, nor could my computer engineer nephew. We finally threw it in the trash and bought a different brand, which worked fine. The cost of the thing wasn't worth the aggravation of trying to return it."
3,Harlequin movie,Thought the movie was okay. The actress playing the lead was really good.I enjoyed it.
4,Emergency!: Crisis in the Cockpit,I found the book to be info. and it makes me never want to fly again
5,This is a great book,"I have read other books on airline disasters, but they were usually dry and sterile. This book, however, takes a different approach. It tells about situations that came up for pilots during actual flights where the courage and ability of those pilots, as well as others, were sorely tested. The actual emergencies chosen are real, frightning, and even scary to read. The author does an excellent job of holding the suspense as he leads you through the emergency, minute by minute. The chosen crisis are also hold-onto-your-chair, and nail-bitting suspense ridden as you read along. It is an excellent narrative, and well written. I highly recommend this read for anyone who wants to know what it is like to be a pilot, of any sized aircraft."
4,A positive approach,"Finally a book that focuses on what went right instead of what went wrong. A positive approach to aircraft incidents. Notice I did not say accidents. Through solid airmanship and crew resource management and a touch of luck, these heroic crews prevented a disaster. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and at the same time provide a look at skills and attitudes we should try to emulate when at the controls of an aircraft. Written in a style that is understandable to a lay person. Highly recommended"
3,Interesting...,"This book is certainly an interesting one, telling stories of near-fatal accidents. It's fascinating to read what is going on inside the airplane at the time, but does not focus on the technical side of aircraft accidents.The flip side is that it doesn't get weighted down with technical language or mechanical intricacies, and really adds a human touch to the crews. The professionalism of crews both in the cockpit and in the cabin are detailed and examined, and certainly offers the reader a chance to re-evaluate the attention we pay to these individuals, who sometimes are the difference between life and death."
4,The story so far,"I have the movie on vhs and I am a vampire aficionado, I think they chose an interesting young actor play Vlad Tepes, special effects like the monster makeup, was interesting. Basically I myself love the film. It has romance, action, horror, what more could a vamp movie ask for?. The ending was also very uncharacteristic of Dracula, because he loved the girl so much he didn't want to condemn her to eternal darkness, whereas in other films Dracula has been more selfish or monstrous. (And from a female perspective I think Brandon portrayed a Dracula that was more human than you can imagine. (And he was quite charming and handsome too)"
1,Rent it DON'T buy it !,"After reading the first two reviews I was willing to give this movie a try. I was very disappointed. This movie has all the awful things of a bad 80's movie, right down to the mullets. The dialogue, special effects (vampire make-up), and plot are very bad. The actor that portrays Vlad is smaller in statue than the girl playing his love interest. I could maybe over look the imagery of the movie if the story was well written, but it is not. Please rent the movie first to see if you like it."
4,Bad Spirit Cheerleader,This item was cute but runs small. it almost did not fit my daughter. Communication in regards to shipping was limited.
1,Please stop dressing your kids like sluts...please,It's bad enoough that the only options for womens halloween costumes are all items a stripper or prostitute would wear. But do we really need sexy costumes for little girls too? I think it's probably a better idea to let your daughter decide when she's 18 years old whether or not she wants to be dressed like a sloppy cock gobbling whore.Thanks.
2,Same ol' same ol',"Westwood's Red Alert was a lot of fun back in the day. I was hoping that Generals would be equally as fun for its time. However, with no fmv to reward me for my accomplishments, this game falls short. There is really no incentive to buy this game over anything made in the 90's, except slightly better graphics.The AI is gross as well. Having a group of tanks move in to take out a bunker is like pulling teeth. If there is a small obstical in the way, they won't move around it, and one guy will try to go in while the rest decide it's not possible.It's one of the many games that feels like EA just shoved out the door as quick as they could to make a quick buck."
3,HA! Not as good as the old one,"This game would be far better if the resources lasted more than an hour. I like to take my time playing a game, build up your forces and attack, but use a strategy. This game requires you to move quick, build your tanks up as fast as possible and attack because when you are done you will not have any more resourses coming in. The AI is horible, it focuses so much on attacking you first thing in the game that before you are done building up your base they have run out of money. NO joke all you have to do is wait for the AI to attack and then send some troops to their base, knowing that they don't have the money to build more troops. I give this 3 stars because the multiplayer seems to be the only reason I play the game."
4,good but should be better,"First off: Can't skip cutscenes. Sometimes they are up to 2 mins long. Jeez.The interface is lacking a bit; it's tough to pick one unit out of the crowd (like say a sniper). When selecting a large group of different units there is no way to tell how many of each unit you have. So selecting just the tanks is difficult or impossible. Rise of Nations has a far superior interface.On the upside, it's pretty. Many cool units on every side. Skirmish mode is fun. Great superweapons."
1,Great Gameplay but Extremely Buggy,"The game itself is one of the most fun RTS's I have ever played. It's not extremely imbalanced and the graphics are very pleasing to the eye.The reason I gave the overall game 1 star is becuase of the poor technical quality. The minimum system requirements are an 800 MHz processor, 128 MB of RAM, and a 32 MB video card (GeForce 2 or higher).I have a 2.4 GHz processor, 1024 MB of RAM, and a 256 MB GeForce FX 5500. Should be able to run the game smoothly, but even on lowest settings and resolution I get extremely poor framerates and occasional crashes to desktop. Usually 5-10 minutes into a game the fps drops to 5-10 and it's impossible to play. EA has stopped supporting this game so there are no patches to fix this issue that a lot of people seem to be having. Do not buy this game, even if your computer should be able to handle it."
5,Great over a network playing multiplayer,"One of our favorite games. We bought a second copy to play over our wireless network. It is great to team up and play against the computer or have a duel match against each other. The adult, the 20 year old, and the 12 year old all love to play. It is a great game to play stand-alone but even more fun playing multiplayer.The computer intelligence in the game is really good, and even though it's a tad old, it's a classic in our house."
5,C&C Just GETS BETTER....AND BETTER!,"Excellent Game. The graphics are very well done, and the gameplay balance is exceptional. These guys from EA really, knew what they were doing, making a military game so well done. This is surely one of the most addicting games I have ever played (2nd To World Of Warcraft) and one of the best games out there!"
4,Command and Conquer Generals Deluxe Edition,"The different sides in this game, (GlA, China, and the USA) are very distinct in a similar manner to that of Blizzard's Starcraft. This is not a traditional Red Alert 1 or 2 game in that it is very guided in how you need to play each mission. The online play is a bit interesting. If you have a slow connection, you will not see games that are at a much faster speed that you can support. In my case, i could only see a total of 5 or 6 games with no filters turned on. General's single player is fun, Zero Hour is more of the same. Overall, an ok game. The expansion is just more of the same however."
5,Totally Addicting,The game was bought for my teenage sons so they could link up on our pcs and play each other. They had so much fun doing it My husband and I had them teach us how to play and now we have all out family wars...but nobody gets hurt! LOL Its a great game..very time consuming but very fun. It really makes you use your brain too. Lots of strategies and very graphical.
1,not recieved,i never got it. it went to another address in another state. so how am i supposed to like it if i dont have it?
4,Maybe I'm just getting old,"But this game wasn't as much fun as Red Alert II.The solo play is very much the same, too fast and furious for much strategy,and your units as dumb as ever require constant babysitting.I get kicks by winning without reloading, through ""superior thinking"" but alas it never worked,either it was a walk in the park or I had to replay the same mission many times.As for multiplayer, do I really want to compete in""who can give commands faster than playing piano""?That being said it has excellent graphics and voices and high production values.Units gaining experience is a plus, even though you can't keep track of them.And there are indeed a great variety of units, too bad it seems impossible to control themfast enough."
2,stargazed28,"this game does not live up to westwood studio quality at all!EA can keep it. constantly lagging, not good story lines, and no james earl jones. but it looks cool! but, looks aren't everything."
3,Hmmmm need a fast computer,"This is a really good game online and off but you need to have a really good computer.I have an Amd Athlon XP 2100+ with a g-force fx5200 ultra and 256 mb ram..And guess what?!?!It still lags a lotWith China it has the best tanks in the world but slow gathering.The USA army is good but not really powerful... the Air Force General is not that good either.Once you get this game i suggest you get the usa: laser general, but hey that's my opinion.The GLA are good at gathering supplies but the are weak in small numbers. Any way you count this this is a solid game...Oh and one last thing the stuff i was talking about like the generals that's all in Zero Hour which is still a solid game."
2,This doesn't go with the C&C series.,"It's a pretty good game but it takes place no where in the C&C series. I have every C&C game except for Covert Ops, Counter-strike, and Retaliation. Generals doesn't seem to fit in between C&C and Red Alert. It is years above Red Alert and a few years behind Command & Conquer, which doesn't make sense because the tiberian meteor was supposed to hit earth sometime then. And what happened to the Allies, Soviets, GDI, and Nod? GDI was formed before the meteor so instead of USA, China, and GLA it should be GDI against some other side maybe even GLA. It's a pretty good game as I said above but you would need a very, very fast computer to play without annoyance. I gave it two stars for a cool war game. I would have given it more stars if it was in the C&C storyline."
4,Great installment to the series.,"I bought this without reading very many reviews because I've loved all the C&C games in the past. I'm very pleased with it so far. The graphics are a huge boost from the previous installment, and the little details like civilians and foliage are great, and the little cut-scenes are right on. Character sounds are awesome and kind of amusing the first times around for some. Money-harvesting is pretty slow, and there's some slowdown in the game even on my new computer, but as of yet I haven't been very annoyed. The 'story' isn't too indepth, but that's to be expected. I haven't gotten to the expansion, Zero Hour, yet but by reading the manual and the few reviews that I did it apparently makes the game even better. A great installment in the series."
3,"Great Game, poor support","This is one of the best games of all time.The problem is with the new patch for Zero Hour version 1.04. When playing with a full map (8 players, 7 of them AI), the game is very choppy, even with a new PC on the lowest settings. I have experienced this problem on my PC, a Athlon 64 3700+, 1GB RAM, NVidia 7600GT Graphics card, with Windows XP SP2.The only solution is to use v1.03, but if you want online play, you must use the latest version 1.04."
3,Okay playset for Passover,"We have KidKraft's Hannukah Set and really liked it so I got my daughter the Passover one as well, its play value is way more limited, they missed a ton of great opportunities with this set. The Haggadah is just a wooden block, how hard would have been to produce an actual book people. Along with the wine bottle, would it have filled them to make the top come off. The seder plate is good but all the pieces are the same size so I had to keep placing the items back in their right spot, easy fix would have been to make it more like a puzzle and have everything be just a flat picture of different sizes. As I said lots of missed opportunities... just buy a kid's haggadah and a plastic seder plate save yourself from having a bunch of heavy wooden objects in your house."
5,The Greatest Christmas Tune In Years!!,"This is an amazing recording! The Whistling Elves with the Bluegrass Police play their new song to commemorate theiruse of the Internet to help with their Christmas duties.This is one hilarious recording, expertly performed and colorfully packaged. This SINGLE is a great stocking stuffer.I love it, my grandmother loves it and my kids love it!!!Be the first in your neighborhood to give the Elves forChristmas."
3,Missing the playability of the original,"The game lacks the excitement of the original Red Baron as well as most of the feel. The game engine is decent and the added American Flyer option is ok, but over all the game is still very lacking of its predecessor."
1,allergic reaction?,Bought this product a few weeks ago. Took it 5 nights in a row and had a headache the next morning each time. Stopped taking it and haven't had a headache since.I probably have an allergy to something in it. Don't know how common my reaction might be.
2,Not as nice as I expected,"On the outside, this is an attractive and distinctive wallet for a diver who wants to wave the flag.The problem is that, as a wallet, it's mediocre. The clear plastic section for a license is too small to hold a California Drivers license. The credit card holder is cheap flexible plastic, and it doesn't fit well inside the wallet itself. One would think that a diver's wallet would feature something special to hold certification cards, but this wallet doesn't. It's actually too small to hold all of my C-cards.In short, it's a so-so nylon wallet made to look like something special for scuba. I don't think it's worth buying."
5,A very helpful book!,"If you have an open mind, this book will be the best investment on the subject you can make. We are not born with an understanding how to be effective in love, so fortunately McKnight and Phillips have compiled that information for us. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in sorting out this love thing, and have lent this book to two of my friends. Hoping to start a relationship? Or handle it effectively during the early stages? This book is great!"
1,a great rippoff !!,"Well this book is a great ripp off ... i had already love tactics and the sequel, and i think that they are very well done, i am appling them with good results , i was disappointed with this edition as it contains the two books that i already have alltogheter with a new cover...that's it no more follow ups just the two old books togheter ...this is a great ripp off"
3,Could have been worse,"My problem with this stuff is not that its manipulative (I mean, if you succeed by meeting someone's needs, however calculating, what's wrong with that).The problem is the notion that this stuff works. Its sure-fire, everytime. There are some good observations and lots of positive thinking but men, and especially women, are too complex to fall for this stuff everytime.So if they said ""Try this; it sometimes works and you have little to loose by trying"" I'd say amen. But if you believe the reviews that say ""I read this book and now the men/women are falling all over me"" this is nonsense."
3,Sun Circles and Human Hands,"Book proved to be an excellent resource. Pictures were black and white throughout the book, but very clear. Descriptions were concise and detailed."
1,"So low budget, it turned into a comedy!","I bought this for my wife for Xmas due to the fact that she is a huge zombie genre fan. I like most of them as well. This movie was hilarious. It was so low budget. The cinematography was horrible, lots of empty street shots and terrible angles on the filming. There also was never any detail in the plot besides zombies running around (very fast, unlike Romero zombies) eating people etc. The acting was horrible, no improvisation. It seemed as though everyone was reading word for word from a script. The national guard actors were so funny. Being an army vet myself, I found it funny that the guys were wearing 1990 style uniforms with beards and double barrel shotguns for weapons in some cases. Nothing more to say, simply horrible and low budget. However , if you want a good laugh, check it out. It was fun to make fun of it."
1,Don't Even Rent It,"All aspects of the cinematography, writing, acting, everything was completely amateurish in my opinion. I love zombie flicks, which means I've seen plenty of B-Movies, and worse. But rarely do I encounter a film that doesn't do one, single thing well. Sorry to be mean, but if you are desperate for some zombie-fix, just re-watch your old favorite(s), don't waste your time on this."
1,"Why use ""Ship Model Building""",This book is hopelessly out of date. For a model builder with even a little experience it purchase would be a waste of time and money. For example: It suggests that fitting such as winches and deck houses be made made of balsa wood. No current modeler would agree. Construction examples almost insure that you will be making a toy instead of a scale model. It's only redeeming feature is that there are a number of good line drawings that provide nomenclature and positioning. Unfortunately the 1961 reprint did nothing to update the book except for the addition of new plans which are too reduced in size to be of much use and are readily available elsewhere.
3,Decent Beginners' Material,"This book is definitely written with the beginner in mind as it is full of great tips and suggestions for the amateur. Although the plates in this book are crudely drawn and the provided plans are too small to be of any great use, I would suggest this book for anyone interested in starting out in the wooden ship modeling hobby."
4,OK - you get what you pay for,A simplistic book but it is supposed to be. Good for a beginning model ship builder even though it's pretty old.
1,Stay Away,"Terrible!! Cheesy animated holiday programs that have nothing to do with Bing Crosby except for the fact that the producers shoved some badly mastered, ancient renditions of some of Bing's Christmas music in each episode. What a waste of materials & money.....AVOID AT ALL COSTS-"
2,the witch's book of magical ritual,"There are some things in this book that are just Not reasonable. Like, scrub down the walls of your ritual room, after every ritual, with hot water and soap, then smudge with a pound of sage. Oh, Pleaseeee."
1,Just like the others,"This book is just like the rest of Frost & Frost Inc.'s ""books"". Total hogwash. The problem with modern paganism/wicca is that people like Gavin and Yvonne just write whatever their little hearts desire and make a huge profit from selling people junk."
4,I did it backwards listening to his Rants audios first.,"Then I watched Black & White. It is a little less polished. But of course it is also live. Probably more shocking in 1992. It is edgy but less so. Dated but still relevant. The obscure references are beauties & had me rewinding the tape. I'm a little dim. Very funny stuff. We may all be going to hell for laughing at God. But with Dennis Miller there, it'll be a funnier place. Worth a rental for sure."
3,Know your audience!!,"I thought that this would be fun for an office party - only to find out that a couple of the questions were ""R"" rated. I never thought that I would have to preview it first. Fun, but..."
3,Good Fun!,"This game was very entertaining for the most part. The questions are drawn from a wide variety of sources and are mixed up well. There are some head scratchers that make you shout, ""Oh, yeah!"" when you finally find out the answer, and then there are the few that everyone will know without too much brain strain.The only drawback on this video is the extrememly cheese-covered sound track. The manufacturer even recommends that you mute the sound and use your own music or scary sounds for setting a mood because this monotonous loop of sound is dreadful after the first ten minutes or so. That being said, the game itself is fun and educational! We had a blast playing it, and it's a perfect Halloween party game."
5,Twilight zone vol.16,I've always loved the series and now can get for a good price and excellent condition.I am now and forever more a loyal customer of amazon.
4,"Evocative,fun and bittersweet","This documentary,which originally aired on PBS in the spring, chronichals the baltimore orioles trip to Cuba a couple of seasons ago, and the subsequent effect on the cuban population, both in Cuba and in the States.The tone of the documentary is friendly, too friendly actually to accomplish it's task. One CANNOT avoid the political implications of a major league baseball team playing the cuban natl. team.That is where the documentary lags. Where it really takes off is the interview with the fan in the street and barber shop[what extraordinary fans],on the origins of Cuban Baseball[native or imported],on the great, great cuban players gone past, on the ice of the embargo. When it comes back to the states, it bogs down. The peripatetic protesters,the agent waiting for defections, the ... defenses of Fidel,the white hot hatred from the exile community sort of spoil this brew.Still, informative heartrending, and to be continued..."
4,Good Examination Of The Political Aspects,"This documentary gives a remarkably balanced view of the political aspects of baseball vis a vis Cuba and the U.S. The film starts with a brief review of the history of Cuban baseball and it's links to U.S. baseball. The second half looks at the 1999 pair of games in Havana and Baltimore and the politics surrounding those two games. Quite a few interesting interviews, including Tommy Lasorda talking about meeting Fidel. Very informative and still relevant over ten years after being made."
2,very basic,"the book glides over all aspects of boat building,photos old and poor,i found as a novice i was still asking the same questions after reading the book(and maybe a few more)than i had before , gives a minimum amount of information and tries (i think)to promote a sale of his boat plans."
3,"Cobbles Baby, not enough cobbles",Let me start by saying I do realize the film is not about the race itself but I do think more footage of the race could have been included. It's advertised as featuring George Hincapie but in reality you really only see him fleetingly race by.
3,Thriller? Comedy?,"Nothing on the cover indicated that i was dealing with a thriller-COMEDY here, so i was surprised to find out during the movie.The whole storyline combined with some good acting performances should have been a perfect setting for a great thriller. But the humor is too subtle to make it a comedy. Some funny meant lines here and there,just enough for not spoiling a good suspense-drama. But during the film it gets worse and worse. The unnecessary and forced stupidity is increasing but the drama also. The story actually makes you angry about the injustice done. But at the end i don't know whether to laugh or to cry. Too much slapstick to make it a serious action-thriller-drama.Still a nice rent though."
4,We Want This Miles On DVD,Whoever owns the rights to this video should kindly release the performance on DVD. Miles Davis has been dead for 15 years now and it's time to honor his memory with a well edited DTS sound and video version of the music that made him famous. Quincy Jones did say in the introduction on stage that it took him 15 years to get Miles to finally play the Gill Evans arrangements again. Perhaps it was a good thing the show was delayed. A video shot in 1975 may not look quite as good as the later recording. And may I suggest they find an appealing photo for the DVD cover instead of that menacing photo of Miles Davis.
1,watch how you shop,"I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines. I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate. I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline. When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part. I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit. I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate. I am very disapointed."
2,Needs more detail,"I find the manual does not have enough detail about key user components. The only thing I wanted to find was how the heater control valve was actuated. The valve was shown and the a\c control panel was shown but the actual linking from the valve to the panel was omitted. The author needs to do more research on user controls such as this. After all this is supposed to be a ""TOTAL"" repair manual."
1,This book is almost worthless,All I wanted was a book that had the codes for the electronic control unit (ECU). This book lists some of the codes but wouldn't you know my ECU is flashing 3 different codes and none of them are listed. A total waste of money.
3,"NOT so ""total""","i am a beginning diyer. simply put, what i already know is in the book, what i don't is missing. it's ok to have it as a reference, but dont expect too much.ps. if you are looking for the 240sx, chances are that you can download a ""factory service manual"" somewhere on the web, maybe free. that's much better than this one."
3,I got my money's worth!,"I got my brakes inspected at [local auto repair shop]. They said that my rear pads needed to be changed. They then said it would be $140 plus the parts. I went to [another local auto repair shop] and bought the pads for $35 and went home. I had a Toyota Celica and had changed my pads before on it, so I thought I could on my 240 as well. Nope. I would never have guessed that you had to turn the piston clockwise to get it to go in. I used a c-clamp and actually bent it trying to push the piston in. One look in the manual told me to turn the piston, not push it, which you do on the front. I only paid [price] instead of $140!!!"
2,Not much new here,"Dave is a truly gifted drummer, but he never shows how he pulls off the complex rolls and grooves he plays, but only demonstrates how to hold and manipulate the sticks. He states that the traditional grip is better for soft delicate playing, which may be true for him, but the great Bill Stewart has no trouble playing soft delicate passages with the matched grip he always uses.The music on this dvd and on his cd's is written and arranged to demonstrate his speed and chops with non stop cymbal accents. It lacks the feeling and emotional playing of drummers like Bill Stewart or Jack Dejohnette. Dave needs to strip his drum kit down to the essentials and get in touch with the music again. Adding more cymbals, hi hats, and drums does nothing to enhance the music or improve the writing.The kit he plays now must be a nightmare for his drumtech/roadie.One can learn to develop technique much better by watching the JoJo Mayer instructional dvd."
3,I guess it depends on what you are looking for,"If you are looking for a biased account of the human tragedy that is Mexican labor, this might be the book for you.If you are looking for a analysis of what is happening and WHY. You may be disappointed.David Bacon clearly wishes that he was the Saul Alinsky of Mexico. If you don't know who Saul Alinsky is, you may have just found your next reading subject.It's not that its poorly written. It is just not impressive in any way. If you can't get enough of Mexico or if you need something to read between globalization protests, you will love it. But its hard to just jump in with an open mind and not be disappointed."
5,Advertising and Media Plannig Book Perfect Purchase!,The book was impecable! perceft condition! and arrived just in time! very fast shipping!...nicely wrraped too! =)
5,Stumpa's Solo Debut is an Allstar Gem,"What a Boom Shot!!! Stumpa & Gathered Nation's ""Piece by Peace"" cd is the best american reggae release that I have heard since the Blue Riddim Band of the 70's. Half of the album was recorded in Jamaica and half in America, but the songs were all penned by Geoff ""Stumpa"" Stump and explore styles like Ska, Roots, Rockers and Dancehall. The track ""War Start"" mixes Rap and DJ style with Native American flute to forward the anti-gang and war message. Other tracks that stand out are ""Ital Woman"", ""Extra Smile"", ""Get Back Home"", and of course the pro-hemp ""Boss Fire"". This CD is a must for original music lovers."
2,Worked for awhile and then broke,"This drying rack was inexpensive and seemed like a good option. With less than 3 weeks of use, one row broke off. It was only subjected to normal wear and tear, and still broke way too easily."
4,Nice,Ramon is one of the best artists that came out of Operacion Triunfo 2003 even though this edition lost a lot of fans because they exploited this to the extreme The best songs are Cuestion de Alma and Todo Vuelve a Importar.
3,Not what I expected,The book was only about a dozen pages and was used. I should have read the description better before buying.
3,zipper broke off soon,"cheap and cute.material is thin and weak, so if kids pack many books and being rough, books inside can be damaged easily.zipper broke within 6 month. good for carrying lunch or cloth, not for heavy books."
2,"Looks good, doesn't last","My second grader picked out this backpack. It looked great and it had enough space for everything she needed to carry. The only issue with it, and it is a BIG issue, is that only lasted 5 months. The fabric just wore out - it is see-through thin in several places. I expect a backpack to at least last an entire school year. This one was a disappointment. I will not buy this brand of backpack again."
4,Great for first grade,So far the zipper has stayed in place. The backpack has held up to daily goings and comings. And my daughter is not embarrassed to take it to school.
2,Flimsy Material,"The entire bag is made of sturdy canvas, except the bottom. The bottom material is a paper product and it ripped completely through after one and a half months of first grade use. If the bottom was made of the canvas, there would be no problem, and I'd give it 5 stars. However, it just isn't durable enough. Why the designers did that, I have no idea."
2,Not made for Heavy use,"this product is perfect for use as a carry-all for toddlers or preschool aged children, but i wouldn't recommend it for children starting school. the zippers are faulty and the fabric wears out quickly. I purchased 3 (one for each of my daughters) and one of them only lasted one week before falling apart. My kindergartener and 2nd grader still use theirs sometimes, but there are holes and tears all over it... Not good for use as a school bookbag. better as a graduated version of a diaper bag, really."
1,Poor construction- don't waste your money.,"This is an adorable bag and my daughter was so excited to find a bag that had all her favorite things (pink, princess, butterflies, & hearts) all in one for her first year of school. She was crushed when after the 2nd day of school, it fell apart beyond any repair.The seams just opened right up, as though they'd never been sewn in the first place and the front pocket was about to completely fall off the main bag. It was definitely NOT from overuse or abuse, since she is just in Kindergarten and didn't have more than one paper in it those days and didn't even ride the bus at that time. I wrote the company and was refunded the cost of the bag but still severely disappointed as we wasted way too much money shipping this when we still had to go buy a new one before she went back to school the next week.Cute cute cute, but stay far away unless you want to have to replace it almost immediately afetr receiving it."
2,purple back pack,Well the back pack is starting to show wear on the bottom where all the books are in there so hopefully it will last till the end of the school year I would have thought it would have held up better but did not. The color looked good when i first got it and one of the zippers is hanging at times. So I would not buy this again and would not recommend.
2,BuckColey,"I bought this for my daughter who is in 2nd grade. Cute bag, but after only two months the shoulder strap has separated from the bag. Might be ok for a overnight bag but doesn't seem to be a good choice for everyday use."
5,Great Bag for School,I ordered this bag for my step-daughter as she started kindergarten and it was like Christmas Morning when she saw it. She absolutely loved everything about it. It fit her like a glove! It's been a while now since she got this bag and she treats it like her purse. She takes it everywhere with her and even camping with her dad. It's been such a great buy that I purchased two blue ones for my nephew. My step-daughter will want to take this to grade school when the time comes!
5,Great price for a nice backpack.,Perfect for my children. The price is right. My kids go through 2 backpacks every year. Glad I bought it. The color is prettier than the photo.
3,A bit disappointing,"I was hoping for more of Anthiel's piano music played by himself. Not much of that, and too much chaff, as another reviewer has mentioned. I wish Amazon would go back to their old methods of listing the pieces on a disc; it was much more helpful and complete than the present method. Actually, I suppose my disappointment is due more to Amazon's lack of good description than to the album itself."
5,What is Cornel West all about?,"I've read a lot about Cornel West--both positive and negative. I bought this book so that I could understand what he was about, and I wasn't disappointed. I really liked his introductions to the essays and the way the book was divided up. I recommend it highly."
1,Dross.,"There may be a point lurking in the undergrowth of his murky prose, but I fail to see it. This book is a complete waste of time except, perhaps, to see what havoc political correctness can wreak upon an intellect."
1,i must agree with jude...,"it is confounding and remarkable that an esteemed (at least by the aw shucks public) institution like harvard could have dershowitz and cornel west as their poster boys. i must agree with president summers; calling west's academic 'output' lacking is an understatement. but then again this is harvard, a shadow of its former self with its self-imposed hiring and admission quotas (or as harvard calls them 'goals'). yes harvard dumped 50 million dollars down the drain after the summers-west flap, which is absolutely ludicrous. who really thinks a racist, unfair system of affirmative action is really the right course for any hiring or admission purposes? it fosters only a 'good as i/we can be' mentality, which is more dangerous in the long run to those who benefit from it than it does those who are penalized by it. merit and achievement should be the only factors for jobs and admissions."
1,poor,"I must say that Cornel West is more suited to acting in the Matrix or singing on his rap album than he his as a 'scholar' or university professor. President Summers was right to justly criticize Prof. West, but of course in the Jesse Jackson-era of America (jump on situations to shill money out of companies, institutions, and individuals in the name of combating 'racism' but really just to line your own pockets...for an example, look at how Jesse and his sons burgled millions out of Anheuser-Busch), Harvard quickly appointed a diversity advisor and earmarked 50 million dollars u.s. for ""diversity."" A sad reflection of the sorry state of our times."
1,fraudulent and vaudevillian,"It is unclear to me why America needs a caricature who uses big words, compound sentences which have no meaning, and gives performances embellished with peculiar dress and movements rather than lectures or speeches. And it is equally unclear why this same caricature makes more sense and says more realistic things in his comments on the radio with tavis smiley. I have no clue who this chameleon is? One minute it is more words than can be digested into a cogent idea or piece of information. The next is reasonable to-the-point observations and suggested actions on his radio show. Stick to Q and A and small intimate discussion. I have been reading and watching for a long time and I am unimpressed. CW went to school learned a lot of stuff and writes it down all of it to see if we are impressed.I am going to spend my time reading something else."
2,i should've listened to their advice...,"i had heard cornel west speak his mind on a few television programs, and i thought to myself, ""i have got to check him out!"" i also heard the numerous negative reviews from other readers. i even voted one reviewer unhelpful (sorry). after reading the first eighty pages of this 600 pg. book, i decided to thumb through it. never before have i read a philosopher's work that was so self-contradictory as his. i should've known better when he described himself as a ""chekovian christian"". i might as well call myself a ""shakesperean buddhist"" or a ""wildean puritan"". the cornel reader will make a wonderful 600-page doorstop, but it will not make anything philosophicaly clearer. use it as a weapon against political ramblers. learn how not to be so consumed by your own egoism that you forget your own intellectual virtues...or follow in my footsteps, expecting more, and be dismayed."
4,A Decent Album From a Talented Artist,"Overall, this is a good album. Fans of Erin McKeown will notice the sound is closer to Grand than to Distillation - more pop and less funk. If that's your thing then add another half star. I think Distillation was her best work, so I have to deduct a few points from this album's overall score.But, there is a lot to enjoy here. Erin's voice is pleasant and inspiring - it has that distinctive timber all good storytelling voices have. As always, the lyrics are imaginative and thought-provoking.As I said, this is a good album but, when compared to Erin's earlier work, not a great album. Still, it's always good to hear from this talented artist."
4,"""it's beautiful, i guess""","I recieved this for my birthday today, and so far i'm having a great time with it! Very upbeat album. Made a great soundtrack, as i ran around the city today. ""White city"" and ""Bells and Bombs"" have a great ""strut"" to them.I've known of Erin for a long time, and distilation was a great album.... but i'm not dissapointed by this one at all. It still has a good vibe that grows with you every listen.I could kick myself for not seeing her here in Seattle last week. Her ""stylings"" are even more impressive live."
5,to the stars....,"Erin Mckeown's references to Judy Garland are a little more understated in this album than the last (grand), yet they are still there if you listen close! It also took me a little longer to get into this one than the last but, overall, I think I like it even more. The lyrics, for the most part, seem more introspective and sanguine, and the melodies are as wonderful as ever! The last track 'You were right about everything' is my favorite."
5,Made to Fly,"I recomend that you buy this CD. I bought her CD before this, Grand, and instantly fell in love. She has incredible guitar skills, a special knack for a jazzy beat, and lyrics that compliment both of those to give those music chills from when you are affected by the words, and encompased by the music. This CD is much more mature and self aware. Both CDs are ones that i can listen to all the way through without skipping a song, or even thinking to take it out."
3,This CD's Beautiful...I Guess.,"We Will Become Like Birds, Ms. McKeown's third album (fourth, if you count Monday Morning Cold) has left me with lukewarm feelings. This disc has a lot less of the diversity I've heard on 'Grand' and 'Distillation', and this uniformity puts me in a sort of trance when listening to it; it's almost like it's one hour long song, all about birds, flying, sky, becoming better. The moments that shine on this album are those that break free of that monotony - especially the techno beat of the soft 'Beautiful, I Guess"" and the remorseful closer ""You Were Right About Everything."" A good try, but I think McKeown should stick to her old style: that is, not sticking to any style at all."
3,This is not Grand,"I love Erin McKeown, but not her latest CD, ""We Will Become Like Birds"". I had high expectations after Grand--which to me was perfect. Unlike Grand, the tracks on this CD all sound the same. The lyrics seem designed to impress us with literary turn of phrase or (gasp!) biology. With her musical talent and awesome voice (not to mention her great stage persona), she doesn't need to try this hard to win me over.I hope that We Will Become Like Birds does not signal a departure from the experimentation and variety so many of us came to love about Erin McKeown CDs."
5,Excuse Me,"Actually, Adams goes right out and says that Hazel was based on a man he met durung his army service, so read closer next time, buddy."
2,"Dull book, except for true Richard Adams' fans","Adams autobiography plots along at a snail's pace as Adams describes in nauseatingly long detail about the plants and birds that lived in the area where he grew up. I suppose that this is exciting for people who enjoy nature walks and such.I labored through the book because I am a dedicated Adams fan. I have read every novel that he has ever written, and enjoyed them thoroughly. The Day Gone By is helpful if you want to get inside of Adams' head and figure out how he thinks. After reading the work, I think that Hazel, a character from Watership Down, may actually be a model for his father, to whom Adams was very close.Other observations about Adams' works can be gleaned by reading The Day Gone By."
3,"Love the plates, but the shipping is rough","We selected the True Blue china as our wedding pattern. We love the china, but Amazon was unable to ship it with multiple place settings without something breaking. We were gifted two place settings, and they were shipped in one large box with plenty of room for them to shift and break in the process. We returned the first set and were promptly sent another set. Unfortunately this second set was broken as well due to improper packing and shipping. We tried to return it for another set because we really want our china, but Amazon said they would only send us a gift card, not try again with the shipping. I would be careful when ordering multiple place settings. When we ordered one place setting a few months ago, it arrived properly packaged and undamaged. It might be best to order place settings one at a time to avoid breaking in shipping."
3,"Portable yes, durable no.","This sharpener is OK for the price, but has be be considered a throw-away item as the diamond cutters that do the work are not replacable. All the wear on the cutters is concentrated in a narrow line, and the grit does wear off - faster if you use any more than a light pressure against the cutters. But it is very portable and will do a good touch-up on a straight blade (not serrated). It is not a substitute for a decent electric unit that will handle straight and serrated blades."
2,Over hyped,"EgdeCraft states ""The pocket sharpener that really works...2-stage Diamond Sharpening for razor sharp edges!"" I had high hopes.I tried the sharpener on numerous knives and the best I could get was a moderately sharp edge on wider knives, but can't even get a reasonably sharp edge on my slicing knife which needs a razor sharp edge.I bought this product in hopes of an easy portable way to sharpen knifes on the spur of the moment rather than using a stone and steel. It looks like it's back to the stone.The sharpener was recommended to me, but I wouldn't recommend."
3,Over Sells It's Effectiveness,"Product packaging uses the term ""razor-sharp,"" and while this sharpener will put a little more of a slicing edge on a dulling knife, it does not produce anything close to being sharp as a razor. I followed the instructions very closely on a kitchen, fishing, and pocket knife of varying steel qualities with mediocre results."
2,They Changed The Center!,"Do you remember the Rolos of several years ago? The Rolos with chewy caramel in the center? Well, that's all changed now. Whatever is in the center is neither chewy, nor caramel as you and I know it. These are not your mother's Rolos."
3,Light hearted and funny look at the end of the world,"I bought the two disc set on a whim, having never seen it or heard of it before. Although the entire series is only two hours long and there are no special features of any kind on the two DVDs, I was not disappointed with the show itself.The year is 999 A.D. and the people of Sludgebrook, Englaland (that's how they spell it) are worried that the world will come to an end on New Year's Eve. This is the story of their adventures and mishaps on the last few weeks of the year.Disc Two contains episodes 4 & 5: Witch and The End of the World. In these last two installments, a woman in the town is accused of witchcraft when the town's possessions disappear and New Year's Eve comes...and goes.If you like British Humor (Monty Python and Red Dwarf), check this out. I would suggest buying the set instead of the two individual discs because you'll want to watch them all!"
5,Excellent,"I really enjoyed this book--the honesty of the personal testimonies really hit home. An excellent resource for parents of premature babies. As for the ""be truthful"" post, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, the personal situations of the writers having to cope with the trauma of premature babies is at times overwhelming, but to judge their behavior is really neither here nor there. The important thing is that these babies made it and are indeed ""living miracles."" Everyone copes differently with trauma, but, ultimately, the babies (and parents) survived to write about it. That sense of triumph over adversity is the resonating theme one gets from this book--and what we should concentrate on as reviewers rather than personal expose's."
4,A NICU nurses's opinion...,"I am an RN and I worked in NICU 10 years ago...it was an experience I will never forget. Like the mothers in Living Miracles, I too came to realize that dealing with the roller coaster experiences in the life of a preemie can be difficult to handle. The 'one step forward, three steps back' is a way of life for these little ones, and for their parents. I applaud the parents who submitted their stories to the authors. Sharing the ups and downs of premature birth indeed encourage others when they are facing the same. In reading this book, I was reminded of how my role as nurse affected the parents. It also provided me more insight into how nurses responses are understood (and misunderstood) by the parents. I highly recommend it to both the preemie parents as well as the NICU nurse."
1,5 DB loss with this antenna on a Hawking Access Point,"I should have read the reviews before buying two of these units. I connected the two antennas to a Hawking Access point. Trying several antenna positions, the access point had a signal strength 5db weaker than with the stock antennas. I used a wireless-G notebook to take my measurements since the antenna is not for wireless N.The results were identically negative on my older Linksys wireless B,G router.These antennas are going back . . . I don't see why they sell them."
1,did not work as advertised,This antenna did not extend the range of my wireless router at all. I was very disappointed.
1,Hawking Hi -Gain 7DBI Omni-Directional Antenna (HAI7SIP),I purchased this antenna based on a article I read in a weekly magazine recommending it to improve weak signals from my router. I was disappointed with this antenna as it added little or no additional signal strength for my wireless laptop one floor above the router.
1,me too.,I'm returning it today--connection strength is no better than the little antenna that came with my wireless card.
1,Does nothing!!,I actually get a better reception with the little 4 inch antenna that came with the Wireless PCI card that I installed on my PC. The antenna looks nice but it does nothing as stated in the nox. Back to COMPUSA for a return on this antenna!
2,Extremely uncomfortable,"The idea is great, but it doesn't work, Somehow those are extremely painful. Need to admit that both my husband and I are skinny people. I dumpled those in the garage and bought ones from Brookstone."
2,tail bone bruise,"After using many different types of pillows for tail bone bruise with no significant relief, I decided to try the gel seat. Once again, it didn't make me feel worse but didn't feel any better either. If anything it was a bit harder. Long trips were still difficult."
2,Not as comfortable as I thought it would be,"I have been using this cushion for the past few weeks and it does not provide the cushion I need. It is also not large enough for my bottom, which has a 38"" measurement from hip to hip. I bought it to relieve the pressure I get when I'm driving, which is especially painful on my right thigh. The gel is not very cushy. In fact, it is a bit stiff. Anyway, this product is not for me."
2,Strong Outgassing,Cushion still outgasses a strong smell months later. No good for an enclosed area such as a car.
3,Good for Smaller Body Frames,"This product helped a little but I decided I needed the larger, thicker Mobil G-Seat and exchanged it for the other product"
2,"Some good features, but overall disappointed","I purchased this product hoping to alleviate excess pressure on my tailbone and glutes from chairs at work and at home. To its credit, the cushion did elevate my tailbone so there wasn't as much pressure in that location. However, the gel was so hard that it pressed uncomfortably against my glutes. The cushion is angled so it is slightly higher in the back than it is in the front, and while I'd guess this was done for ergonomic reasons, in my case it seemed to make things worse. I found myself wishing it contained a lot more gel. It didn't ""give"" enough to be a good cushion for my needs.It's too bad, too, because other than that the design is really great. I love that it folds in half, just about the size of a big clutch purse, so you can carry it easily in a bag or under your elbow. I would have kept it if it were the least bit comfortable, but it just didn't help me at all."
5,Love this item!,Guaranteed to please Batfans of all ages. The kids will love it for the playability and the adults will love it for the great addition to their Bat-Collection.
2,too time-consuming!,"I checked out a copy of the book from the library before buying it. After making 3 of the recipes, including some that she says are her regular breads, I found them too time-consuming for the outcome. Roben Ryberg's breads are much simpler for the small difference in taste. If you have the time, though, go for it!"
4,The Gluten-Free Gourmet Bakes Bread,"A great little cookbook. My only disappointment is that many of the recipes use flours that are just as bad for weight gain as wheat flour. I do not have a gluten intolerance, I just bought it to go with my ""Wheat Belly"" book. I'm trying to remove the wheat sources from my diet, and without a doubt there are many of these recipes that I can use."
3,Buy some Beano,"This author is very fond of bean based flours. I assume that most people choose this diet because of digestion issues, like me. I was not happy to add excessive gas to my lengthy list of digestive problems. I may try some more recipes in this book, but will use substitutes for the bean flours.I do praise the author for including nutritional information for each recipe and for providing recipes that are not overly high in fat."
3,"Great Sounding Recipes, But Check Your Pantry First!","For anyone newly diagnosed with Celiac disease, it doesn't take long to figure out the Bette Hagman is 1st in gluten free cookbooks. Her previous books not only contained recipes, but wonderful information for Celiacs. So I must say I was disappointed to find out that I could not try a large portion of the recipes in this book because they all contain a flour that I am unable to obtain. Bette's latest favourite flour is sorghum flour, and it is produced in the U.S. by JOWAR foods. Neither my local health food store, nor myself via their web page, have been able to get a response on ordering this flour to be shipped to a Canadian address. What recipes I have been able to try have been wonderful, but with the main section of this book based on having sorghum, I would not recommend this book unless you have access to this ingredient."
1,Not so gourmet,"I was disappointed with this book. Many of her breads call for use of unflavored gelatin which gives the loaves a springy texture which works right out of the oven but makes for a gross, hard consistency once cooled (kind of like cold chicken fat - EW!) I have had much more luck with Rebecca Reilly's recipes. I find them more sophisticated, less 1950's inspired. Also, Living Without Magazine featured a great bread recipe in their November 08 issue. This woman has posted the recipe with step-by-step photos on her blog: [...]"
4,happy bread eater,"I have been cooking (and eating) my way through this book! It is easy to read, and follow. Lots of variety in the recipes. Worth every penny!"
2,Dissapointed,"Don't waste your money, recipes aren't very good and use a lot of hard to find ingredients. Bread is not very tasty either."
5,Gluten-Free Gourmet,"Uses a lot of starches and things that raise my sugar levels, I am diabetic. The recipes look interesting but I don't have access to the flours required. We are rural and I will have to mail order the flours."
5,Great Tasting Bread and Goodies,Finally a cook book with great recipes that actually taste like real food instead of cardboard. This book is a must a for all of the gluten intolerant. The pita bread makes fabulous flat bread for sandwiches. Great variety and every recipe I have tried has been a keeper.
4,This book seems to work,"I am ""WHEAT"" Intolerant, NOT Gluten intollerant. I could not find a BAKING or BREAD book for ""just"" WHEAT-LESS Baking, so I reviewed this book and purchased it. Bread is my ""STAPLE"". Though it is GLUTEN Free (not just wheat-free), I tried a couple of the recipes and I have been pleasantly surprised. I am a scratch baker and bake everyday...nothing works like wheat but this is a pretty good alternative and has really good direction. Gluten free baking is nothing like wheat baking so you have to learn the new rules and they are layed out well in this bread book. I purchased a G.F. BAKING book at the same time and am ready to test-drive a few of those recipes/instructions next. I think you'll be happy with this book."
5,Bread-HOT from the oven again!,I've always made bread for my family. When I got the diagnosis of Celiac disease I felt crushed even though I nearly died from this disease before the doctors properly diagnosed my illness. None of my families old favorites worked with these darned gluten free flours! Now at long last I have a book that helps me get the start I needed to get going again with the gluten free flours that I must use in order to live.
5,Simplifies gluten free baking for non-bakers!!!,"I am not a baker, but I must learn to bake as buying gluten free bread is 1) expensive 2) not very tasty and 3) they are barbie-sized bread loaves!! This book gives you the what to use & why to use it which is fantastic. There are also recipes for crackers and other traditional wheat products. Enjoy!"
3,Buy yet more flour???,"I really don't want to slate this too much, as I haven't actually used it, BUT:After using packet mixes for years, I decided i had more time and less money, so I would start to make my own. I spent a fortune on flours etc. and used recipes from the internet - the bread was always a disaster.So I ordered this book. This is the fourth gluten free cookery book I have bought since diagnosis 5 years ago. Why oh why does each book and sometimes each recipe within a book use completely different flours? Why do some use yeast, others baking powder, others baking soda... I had already spent a fortune and had a selection of flours, then this book has a list of further different, and I have to agree with the other reviews - totally obscure and very expensive flours.I started looking for flour on the internet, then thought ""sod this"" and ordered mixes instead.We aren't stupid, we are celiacs, give us some simple recipes we can work with please."
3,Just OK,It was way too old to do me much good. I forgot to check the publication date before ordering. I'm sure it was very informative ten years ago.
1,Ridiculous,"If I wanted bread with 50 ingredients, I would go buy Wonderbread at Albertson's. Don't mistake gluten free for healthful. This book reads like a science experiment manual."
4,Gluten-Free Gourment Bakes Bread,"I have only one complaint about the whole thing. I love the book, it came in the condition it said it would, but the lenght of time of the delivery was way too long since we lived in the same state. I've gotten other things faster that were across many states. So if I had to give a score for it, there would be a thrumbs DOWN.The Gluten-Free Gourment Bakes Bread Book"
2,Gluten Free Breads,Frustrating! having to make combinations of many flours. Book could have simplified recipes and given individual hints. I'll keep trying.
3,Needs To Rethink The Bean Flour Mixture,"There are a great many bread recipes in this book, but I have found that some of the breads are too sweet or just taste downright bad due to the beany taste. The bean flour blend IS higher in protein than the rice blend but some of us cannot tolerate the bean flours either. I found that the bean flour breads left an overpowering aftertaste, needless to say I wasn't impressed. Most of the recipes I found I had to use the rice blend instead of the bean blend and then add some extras for protein and had a far better tasting loaf of bread. To each his own though. All in all, it is a very usable bread book just use your imagination to expand on the recipes!"
1,Great if you can get the ingredients,I have read this book from cover to cover and it is useless because every recipe needs tapioca flour and I cannot get it here in Australia. I'd recommend having a look at the flour mixes on page 40 to make sure that you can get all of the basic ingredients.
5,Very good,"This is a great cookbook. I also have the Gluten-Free Gourmet by the same author. There is a lot of repeat in the breads, but the book is well worth buying if you like to eat great bread, even if you are not gluten-free. I love having cookbooks that consistantly provide great tasting and reliable recepies."

1,The Best of Charles Bronson,At first i thought how did they get 3 films on one disk but after watching this disk i thought someone had a video camera at the back of the cinema the quality of the picture struggles all the way though it is very jerky and the sound is not much better. The first film Chino is pretty good 6 out of 10 The second film Cold Sweat is a classic 8 out of 10 The third film Lola sees bronson in a romantic role total rubbish 1 out of 10 the main problem with all these films is the transfer to dvd it's the worst i have seen on DVD or VIDEO & i know what i'm talking about i have over 200+ DVD & 1500+ VIDEO you have been warned
2,Disappointing results for some expensive tape!,"This product is WAY overpriced for what it does. Although it does in fact reflect light, it does not do it well at all. It's a 3 part tape with a removable backing that allows it to be applied, and a removable covering that enhances the effect, if it can be called that. I used this as driveway reflectors on my solar lights stems, so I could see better on days when the sun does not charge the lights. Coming in the driveway with my HALOGEN backup lights right on them they DO NOT REFLECT back to me. I found out that in order to see any reflection from this ""Scotchcal"" tape, the light source and your line of sight have to be parallel, or else you will just see shiny black tape. Might as well just use black electrical tape. It's about 1000% cheaper and looks identical. So long as your lights are higher or lower that your own line of sight, sadly this is a complete DUD."
1,Apparently some mix-ups in shipping,"I'm not sure what the issue is with this product, apparently some kind of mix-up in stocking or shipping or something because I also got Scotchcal and not Scotchlite. The tape I received is definitely NOT reflective and, yes, I knew about the plastic top film that needed to be removed. From reading previous reviews it seems that some orders receive Scotchlite and some orders receive Scotchcal. Buyers beware, you might not get Scotchlite when you order this product, you might receive the wrong product and this is a pretty expensive purchase to be getting the wrong tape."
5,Schticky,"put it on my motorcycle rims. sticks good, and was easy to apply (even in a circular direction). My bike looks like it has lights on the wheels, like Tron. Supadope!"
1,Bogus Item ! !Don't BUY ! !Phony !,"I recently bought this item thinking that it was a roll of 3M scotchlite like the description claims it to be but then I received it only to find out that it's really Scotchcal. The following is straight from 3M's website :3M(tm) Scotchcal(tm) FilmA tough, durable polyester film for emblems and markings and for protecting vehicle finishes. Available in a variety of colors, perforated or non-perforated. For commercial automobile OEM and aftermarket applications.No where does 3m Say that it is reflective! This is a complete misrepresentation of a product !"
4,Better and better each time you listen,"This is a terrific CD with a mix of blues, R&B, jazz and rock. The female vocalist is terrific. Hope she sings more next time around. Look forward to seeing the group perform Live in So. Cal."
4,Not bad for the price,"Not bad for the price,the close up images are amazing.Lots of compression on the dvd and Picture quality could be better but,Nevertheless a wonderful film and I would recommend this film for anyone fasinated by the wonders of nature."
5,reminds us of the wonders of our existence,"this movie shows us that life is so intricate and incredible that we need to be grateful and kind to other lifeforms, and never forget, live in each moment, enojy your life!!"
3,"good photography, but hokey narration","I loved the photography in this DVD, the pictures of the critters were awesome. I didn't care so much for the endless shots of waves and mud. I also found the narration irritating and probably would have enjoyed it muted more. I'm not sure if it was the voice itself or the content. The sound effects were not good either. Though the giant Galapagos Turtles are huge, I'm quite sure they don't sound like a tyrannosaurus rex pounding through the grass, and I know that teeny crabs don't sound like a herd of locusts chewing their way through the savannah. I would have been much happier with the natural sounds of the forests or jungles to back up the beautiful pics.My recommendation would be to give this film a miss and instead go with one by the same director that is infinitely better - Microcosmos. THAT one I highly recommend."
3,Amazing film - Bad DVD,"This film is a wonderful experience through natures immagination.Amazing visuals and great composition, BUT...There is a lot of compression on the DVD. The picture could be better.The worst part about it all is that they dubbed the french african narrator!! When I saw it at the theater they subtitled it, and it was a lot better. I don't understand the reasoning for this, but thats what you get.I seriously suggest watching this film though - just too bad the DVD isn't as good."
4,Impressive visualization of nature,"Outstanding scenes of nature, with exiting stories. very good to teach kids about nature's wonders."
3,Not Bad!,"Prime Cuts is an interesting release featuring the dual guitars of front man Mark Leddy and Tony Vega. Together they couple various shuffle styles with tasty chops without going over the top. Some of the songs like ""Too Many Girlfriends"" ""Blues Face"" and ""Meat Cutter"" are noticeably lacking in lyrical creativity and it takes the artistry of guest guitarist Mark May to save ""Blues Face"" from total boredom. A couple of noteworthy tracks break the shuffle mold which at times seems a little boring. The two tracks at the top of the pack are the slow blues number ""Good Woman"" which includes some standout organ playing by Hamilton Loomis and the acoustic ""I'm A Dog"". Nothing special but it is consistent throughout and does feature some very good licks."
2,Nice idea - but only so-so writing quality,"This book does indeed entertain as well as delve into subjects not usually covered in the Realms novels. But I found the writing, over all, to be of average quality and the dialogue contrived and not very believable. That would make it three stars, but I subtracted one since the flow isn't quite there; you aren't compelled to read just a little longer than you should to see what happens next."
2,Subpar for the genre,"This book was marred by weak characterization and a flimsy plot. It seemed as though it was rushed to print (several typos) and is clearly not up to the fine standard other Forgotten Realms books have set. None of the characters were very likeable and it all seemed a bit silly. This was a disappointment in my opinion. When compared to Paul Kidd's Greyhawk novels, this book was seriously lacking."
5,This Caymmi is a Master as His Father Is!,"Caymmi is a Brazilian family dedicated to music. And what a family! Dori Caymmi is son to Dorival Caymmi, the famous composer/lyriscist/singer of old Brazilian popular music. Dori was a 2000 Grammy nominee and he is a longtime deserver of all prizes for his wonderful music. Though an excellent arranger, guitarrist and composer, Dori is also an incredible singer, with a strong, deep timbre. This is a must CD."
2,I've listened to a lot of Brazilian music...,"...and I thought this was incredibly boring. It's snoozy, unchallenging easy listening. If that's what you're looking for, then this disc is a fine example of the style. But if you want just a *little* bit of life in your music, you should look elsewhere. A disappointment, coming from the son of one of Brazil's greatest samba composers, Dorival Caymmi."
3,The version of Brasil (Aquarela Do Brasil) for grown-ups,"Worth the price of admission. As another reviewer stated; ""very sensual""."
3,PTC Home and Garden Ladder Shelf/Towel Rack,"had higher expectations for the quality of this item .. at $100 it should be well constructed but is cheap appearing with a somewhat poor finish and could be more sturdy. I would put its value at half that amount. Also - company won't ship to Alaska ... come on, fed-ex and UPS both ship ground ... it's really not that difficult nor expensive. Alaska is part of the continental US ... just not the contiguous!"
2,Cute...their sizes are WAY off,"These are really cute, but don't believe the size charts, they run small. I wear a 6 at old navy and thought based on the size chart here that would translate out to a medium...I was wrong! These were so tight on my hips that it was uncomfortable. I figure that I need at least a large for them to fit right...oh well, at least they were super cheap so I didn't waste much money."
5,White Shoulders 6.8 oz,"Have always loved this perfume, including the body lotion. Received in good time in good condition."
1,Piece of junk - broke in a few months.,"My father bought this boombox a few months ago. It worked great when he first bought it- everything worked, the sound was great etc. Now, when I play a CD is makes a whirring, scratching sound but it still plays the CD. Also, when I play a CD nothing shows up on the panel where it tells you what track your on or how long you are into the CD. It's blank and nothing shows up. And, the radio stopped working. I was trying to listen to the radio one day and it didn't work. There was nothing wrong with the antennae and I never dropped it or did anything to destroy it. It shows me the radio station but nothing plays, even though the volume is all the way up.Overall, this boombox is a piece of junk. Played the first few months and now the radio doesn't work, neither does the CD playing properly. Do not buy this product, yo9u will regret it and ask for a different one.1 out of 5 stars."
1,Save Your Money!,"We bought this boombox based on the previous review. I think we got a lemon! The box sounds Great, just as the previous review said. But, The first day we had it the CD started skipping. The second day the antenna broke off just above the attachment point. I contacted RCA and thought ""no problem"" it's under warranty. RCA told me to contact a service center and have my credit card number ready. Nope... Not paying for Anything that is supposed to be under warranty. Great idea RCA, sounds really Good while it worked (two days), but it's JUNK made with cheap parts! Save your money."
3,"Good for price, a few problems however...","The remote failed to work soon after receiving - not sure if that is permanent (ie: batteries I have are in question). The CD player is not anti-skip, so certain high-vibrate songs will make the CD skip - even at moderate volumes. Sometimes you have to push-in the buttons on the player a little harder than normal (may be the problem for other neg comments in past on here). The sound quality is good for the price. The FM reception is not the greatest, but could be the building/part of town I live in. The FM stations have a hard time of locking-in the stereo reception (comes in mono alot). Everything else is good for price - good appearance."
5,Great cd player!,The cd player is great!I have a cd that won't play on my cd player and it dose on this one!
3,Fragile and frustrating,"It took me half an hour to get the exact configuration for this track so that the beans wouldn't get stuck on the turns. Using the configuration that the instructions give you doesn't work, you have to adjust and adjust (and break your fingernails) and then, when you've finally gotten it put together correctly, someone will bump it and you have to start over. The track does not snap onto the supports, it only rests there, making it too fragile for children to play with. It stinks."
1,Really bad toy!,"Do not get this toy. It is horrid. Takes forever to put up. If the track isn't perfect, the beanz don't go down. If you bump it even just the slightest amount it falls down and you have to rebuild it. Awful toy, do not recommend it."
1,The tracks don't work. Don't waste your money.,"I am usually not very negative with toys but considering the price tag on this toy, it is a complete waste of money. The tracks don't work and fall apart easily. Looking at the cheap plastic that the tracks are made of, [...]. Don't waste your money. If your kids enjoy the beans, just buy the beans for less than half the price."
3,fascinating!,"The reason for the three stars is to do with elements of repetitiveness, and a feeling that this is really for the specialist. If it were stars for the importance of these recordngs, that would be more like 9!Thank heavens for the enthusiasts and collectors who have saved this glimpse into a faraway and mysterious world which, amazingly, is still more or less within living memory."
3,OK Product,"I purchased this product because it seemed less expensive than the vitamins I had been buying. But, after getting them I realized that I'd have to feed 3 to 4 per day rather than the usual 1 I had been feeding. So, since I have two rather large cats, if I give 4 a day, that's 8 total per day. Therefore a bottle will last me one month. However, my cats really love them (although my cats will eat anything), but it is more of a pain to give them both in the morning feeding and in the evening feeding. Maybe it's just lazy on my part! I haven't noticed anything different in the cats' coats, health, etc., but again they've been on vitamins their entire lives. If I had known how many to feed per day, I would not have purchased this product as I was happy with the vitamins they've been on and I find them now to be far less expensive."
4,Nice vitamins,"Very complete formula, reasonable price and they don't taste too bad. My cat ate them as is for a long time. When he got picky I started hiding them in half or a third of a ""pill pocket"" to improve the taste. I have an elderly cat and these supplements have definitely been helpful."
5,Excellent study of 1 of aviation's most troubling mysteries,"Highly recommended! I'd been aware for years that the cause(s) of this accident, along with an earlier one in Colorado Springs, were unresolved - a deeply disturbing fact, given the fact that the 737 (a beautiful, durable, and seemingly reliable flying machine) was and is in such widespread use. Only recently did I learn that the NTSB had come to a probable cause determination, and this book is a thoroughly masterful telling of the unfolding of the accident and ensuing investigation. It reads like a mystery book, and satisfyingly explains what went wrong. One suggestion for any 2nd printing: some pictures of the crew about whom so much is written; their omission, while pictures appeared of one passenger featured in the book, was curious and unsatisfying. Otherwise, however, a powerful, informative, and very well-written story of this sad event."
2,Soo disappointing,"I'm sure some people like this album, but I'm not one of them. The best part of this album is Wades Point. The music overall is sappy with a rock beat. It's something I might expect to hear in a smoke filled piano bar, but not something I would want to listen to at home."
5,A Voice Like a Dream,This is a fabulous album. I understand that it took Jacky two years to write all of the pieces on the CD! They are all wonderful. His range is incredible and his voice rich. You need to own this one. I recommend it most highly.
2,Small on Size and Features,"It's the perfect size, but the lack of a zoom lense kills it. Also,the indoor photos have a redish tint and the quality of the photos fell far short of the Canon Elph 300. The only zoom on the camera is digital zoom -- just like cropping a photo on your computer.The MP3 player software forces you to convert via a special process, but if you can get the music on to the camera then it's a great plus."
2,"Nice, but probably not worth the money.","An excellent camera with a few major faults:The obvious one - theres no optical zoom. If you look through the viewfinder, and your subject is only taking up a tiny fraction of the display, YOU're the one that's going to have to physically move yourself closer to the subject. The camera cannot do the zooming-in for you.And secondly, the shutter speed is far too slow. Trust me, you cannot take photos of, say, people dancing. All you'll get is a blur.Oh, and why Fuji neglected to include the AC Adapter as part of the package is beyond me. Supplying two rechargeable batteries, which take about 13 hours to charge simply isn't on...That aside, it is a good little camera. TV-Out is more of a gimmic than something you'll use regularly, as the pictures look very fuzzy, even on a decent TV. And it's very very easy to use, and produces very good photos.But personally, I'd think twice about going for this camera over, say, the Canon Ixus V."
3,"Fun & easy, but be aware of its JPEG-only file storage","I like this camera for its compactness and well thought-out features. BUT, if you are someone who likes to tweak the photos in your image-editing software when you get home, be aware that you'll be working from JPEG originals. This is not ideal, as JPEG is a 'lossy' format, meaning that when you save the edited image, you lose quality. I tried to compensate for this by shooting at the camera's highest quality setting and editing down from that; but the result was still a 2nd gen. JPEG with the typical flaws starting to show. This is true even when you save at the highest-quality JPEG setting (e.g., in PhotoShop)."
2,Bad example of a great story,"I've pretty much seen every filmed version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"", but I still haven't read the book so I don't know what the real plot is to this historical novel. This is a poorly acted, poorly filmed serial from 1932. It was one of Harry Carey's last pieces of work from what I gather. In this story, Alice, the younger sister, is romantically involved with Maj. Heyward. There's never any inkling of romance between lovely Cora and ugly Hawk-Eye. Chingachgook is always called The Sagamore. I never heard Chingachgook. Now I watched the first 4 episodes and the last one. The jacket said this is 108 minutes. Nope. Try 3 hours and 43 minutes. The adaptation is also hard to watch. It flickers, is grainy and of poor quality. While I still love the story in general, this is a pretty bad example."
5,Neat Book,"This is a neat book. Why isn't the whole world aware of the problem she presents? What we have, as many of the writers here seem to recognize, is the last gasp of the Cultural Revolution -- and going on right now, in almost every women's studies program in America. Patai can't stop it, but at l;east she's pointed out the problem. She doesn't really discuss why this has happened, nor does she discuss possible solutions, but limits herself to a painful description of the problem as it exists."
1,Much ado about less than nothing,"The author seems to imagine that the tiny, tiny, tiny handful of feminists who hold anti-male views somehow weild enormous power. She ignores real threats to both women and men, prefering to concentrate on a powerless group with fewer adherents than the Jews for Hitler League. She thinks that ""passionate rejection of men"" is the one thing that unifies feminists, and from such an absurd statement, one can not possibly take seriously anything else she says. She also seems to assume that ""heterophobia"" is some kind of looming menace, which is preposterous and insulting that any thoughtful person."
1,More rightwing paranoia.,Don't conservatives get tired of their own nonsense? Here is yet another book designed to say that feminists and liberal academics are conspiring to destroy civilization. Anyone who spends more than a few months on the average college campus or knows many people who support the goals of feminism already knows what garbage this is. I might add that anyone who has been sexually harrassed will be understandly offended by the book.
3,Good phone,"I've used for a month now. All the other reviews seem to be dead-on.Have been mostly pleased with the speaker phone. I have had a few instances where I have issues understanding people on it, they keep cutting in and out. I've about decided this is some sort of connection issue or maybe a combo effect of their speaker phone and mine. Not sure, it's not often, so when I start getting this sort of every other word effect, I just pick up the handset.I haven't used half the features the phone has, but it's working great."
1,AT&T 992 Defective Caller ID,"If you work from home and need caller id, skip this phone, unless you don't mind unplugging the second line each time you want to know who's calling you. That's right, you read correctly: For the caller id and/or the call waiting-caller id to work, you can only have one line plugged in. I've been in Telecomm for 22 years so I've tried everything: I tested it at the home demarcation point, I used a friend's phone, the works. Funny fact: I tried making Line 2 my primary line and this made the caller id work for 1 day; but now we are back to plugging and un-plugging the 2nd line. I'm on my way back to Staples to return this piece of junk."
3,So-so 2 line phone,"I agree with previous reviews, this phone does have a very noticeable hum when in use and yes, the caller ID for line 2 works when it wants to, but I'm willing to overlook those 2 flaws because of the switchable data port. I can choose whether to send/receive faxes from either line. All the newer 2-line AT&T; phones that have a data port the port is for line 2 only. I also don't like that the lcd display is either lit all the time or not at all, it should light up only when receiving a call, dialing out, or a button is pressed.EDIT: After doing some searching the hum and sporadic CID for line 2 is NOT the cause of the phone, it has something to do with a ground loop. I plugged my GE instajack into it and not only is the hum GONE but Called ID for both lines works all the time now!!"
1,Speaker phone sucks!!,the speaker phone on this phones sucks!! you can't turn it up loud enough without getting a lot of distortion and the other person on the line can barely hear you.
2,At least I got 8 months service out of it,"Speaker crapped out after 8 months - doesn't always respond when you dial a number. Programing interface very confusing.Not sure if it is worth the trouble to get it replaced - especially after hearing the other reviewer's problems with tech support.btw - Don't be fooled by the ""AT&T;"" on the label - it has nothing to do with the old Bell System equipment (the ""Touch Tone"" and indestructable black rotary dial phones) AT&T;/Lucent Technologies sold off the consumer products business ages ago. The real AT&T; should be ashamed. This is the danger of licening out your brand name."
5,Great phone,"I've had this phone for about 2 years now. I use both lines. All features have worked great. Speaker phone is clear, buttons, everything great."
1,Less than 1 star,We have a small office and had the misfortune to buy this telephone for our receptionist to use. Within days it began to cut off longer calls and drop calls on hold. Don't even consider this phone no matter what the price!
1,Great unless you need to use the second line,"I bought this phone, returned it, got another. In both cases the same problem has occured which is whenever I use line 2 the '9' key jams. Meaning it just stays pressed. This never happens on any other key or when on line 1."
4,"Great, inexpensive 2-line phone","I replaced an old AT&T; 2-line phone recently with this one. Although it is not a very exciting purchase, it does the job quite well. The sound is good and the caller ID feature works as you would expect it to. I purchased a headset at the same time and use it in the headset jack - sounds great and easy to use.If I had any criticism, it would be that there is only room for 18 speed dial buttons. If you need more than this, it could be a problem."
1,Awful speakerphone,"The speakerphone on this unit is terrible. The phone appears to interpret ambient noise to mean the user is speaking, thus muting the caller on speaker. The end result is that you can barely understand anything the caller is saying, as the beginning and ending of every phrase is clipped off. Stay away from this phone."
1,Absolute junk,"Caller ID may not work if two lines are connected and LED will dim or flicker ... Telephone call to support from AT&T was laughable ... Stay with Amazon, they have some great items at great prices, but recommend you pass on this one...!"
1,"Get Rid of the ""BEEP""!!!","Two things are a deal-breaker for me. The phone is going back.1) If you're on Speakerphone and mute the phone, ok. But as soon as you return off of mute, the phone gives a loud ""BEEP"" on the line for all to hear. That makes it USELESS. I don't want to be forced to always announce when I'm coming off mute. Why would the manufacturer do this? Very stupid.2) All of the keys have an annoying beep also. Press directory, ""beep"", press call history, ""beep!"", press the menu key, ""beep!"", press a one-touch key, ""beep!"".Too bad because the rest of the phone I love. The CID works great for both lines, the speakerphone audio seems to be great. Oh well... poor choice by the manufacturer / phone developer."
2,Sub-par Speaker Phone Capability,"I purchased this phone for two important reasons: Caller-Id and it's speaker phone function. The caller-id and phone directory worked well, however the speaker phone quality was very poor. Maybe it was just bad luck with this model, but I have decided to stay away from the ATT&T brand. I would suggest you look into AASTRA/NORTEL phones. I purchased the model 9120 which had the comporable features I was looking for and up to now it has performed flawlessly."
2,BEEEP--BEEEEP-BEEEP-BEEEP-BEEEP your XXX,"Every key you hit on this thing triggers a loud beep. They have to be kidding with all the beeping this thing does...and to what end????? There is no added value to the beeping.As a business phone, this phone is useless. Try taking someone off mute...the beeping sound makes them think you are recording the call...not a very nice image to create in the minds of your colleagues and customers.If you have busy phone days like I do, you may need to juggle a few calls at once...2nd line...cell phone.... you may not want the person with whom you are speaking, to know that you have muted the phone on your end...this phone gives you no choice, when you drop off and come back on, it will beeeeep you till you fling it out the window. This will surely drive you nuts if you're a business user.It would be soooo simple to make this a user programmable option.Don't bother with this phone."
3,It's OK,"The phone works pretty well. It has some good features ie; speed dial on speaker.I have found that if you press the keys too fast, your calls do not complete.Otherwise than that, I like it."
1,Terrible if you need 2 lines,If there is a call or someone is using one line from another extension you hear the conversation on the second line and vice versa. There is often static on the line as well. I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted my money on this phone!
2,"Good Phone, One Bad Feature",I like everything about the phone except the fact that the mute button makes a beep when you mute/unmute. I have to get on large conf calls and I'm the only one with this beeping sound. Everyone knows it's me! That defeats the whole purpose of muting.
5,992 is a great phone,"After frustrating experiences with both Polycom and Siemens phones not working correctly with caller ID, voice mail notification, etc, I was delighted to pick up a AT&T; for less than half of the price of the other 2 line systems and find it worked perfectly.I was concerned initially that voice mail detection didn't work, but after reading the manual and discovering that it is shipped as default off and turning it on everything is great."
1,Mine is junk,"I would not take the chance and buy this phone. I bought 2 batteries for the phone as it always indicates the battery is low. Found out after further examination that the battery compartment does not fully close. I've tried all kinds of remedies including taping it shut. Nothing works. Now if I jiggle the battery compartment, the phone disconnects and ""Power Failure"" flashes. If I stand up or move the phone while talking to someone, the phone disconnects. Sometimes when I'm simply dialing a number it freezes and stops dialing. The red light indicating a new call has come in is always on. It does not flash when someone has left a message. It's going in the trash and I won't buy another AT&T phone."
5,"Top of the line reading, if you want a good healthy family","This book is very informative, and makes so much common sense. You have your family for such a short time, and before you know it they are out there trying to figure it all out. Well this book is entertaining as well as informative. And helps Me as an adult how important time is and how to spend my time even if you live alone, you will rethink how you entertaining yourself."
3,Fun to watch it drown,"Too cute, doesn't swim but funny when it flails and does somersaults in the tub. My son likes it."
3,Not for the Faint of Vision,"I have given an intermediate review because I do not want to affect the rating computation unduly. I found on receiving the book (the only U.S. edition), that the print is much smaller than ordinary paperback print, so that I have not yet made my way through it. I write to warn others who may have difficulty with very small print."
1,"No ""10 min. Jump Rope Program""","The rope is fine, it does its job as it should. However, I bought this particular ""Magic Speed Jump Rope"" from this particular seller as the product features listed ""10 min. Jump Rope Program"" as part of the package. I was disappointed not to receive the program and only the rope. Seller should not make false representations, hence only 1 star."
3,"It says very clearly that it is only sold IN PAIRS, but they sent me a single..","BEHRINGER B2031A TRUTH ACTIVE STUDIO REFERENCE MONITOR PAIR""All TRUTH monitors are delivered as ""matched pairs"" with individual response ""They sent me only a single..The product itself is very good, and I am very satisfied with it, but not the service.I need the other one, the one you owe me!"
5,"An Excellent, Portable Travel Atlas","This is a superior travel atlas, with easy-to-read maps of anywhere you would like to travel within Indonesia. Handy travel hints and highlighted points of interest. This is the perfect companion to your Lonely Planet guide. My only problem is with the less than sturdy binding; future editions (and all travel atlases) should have a strong binding and more travel-ready front and back cover. I've laminated all of the pages for my travels, and it's held up very well."
3,"Excellent for mental shift to OO, but that's about it","A friend loaned me this book when I was first starting to learn C++ many years ago.The first section where the author describes the OO approach is excellent - you couldalmost hear the light bulb go on in my head as I read it. Before, OO was just a listof arbitrary and confusing rules to me. Afterwards, I ""got"" OO and was able to begindesigning software from an OO perspective.After that first section the author gets more specific, and I began to lose interest.I would still recommend the book just for that opening section, but advise a reader toquit reading after that."
2,Wasn't what we were looking for,We ended up selling it. It wasn't what we were looking for - we needed something more entertainly/interactively written. It's for an older student.
3,Very out of date,"I'm not a beginner to German, and so I thought this book was fun and easy to understand. However, every time I ask my roommate (who is FROM Germany)questions about some of the sentences in the book, he bursts into laughter. I can't tell you how many times he's asked me how old this book is. As one other reviewer stated, the book has not been updated since the 50's. If you try to speak to a German person after having studied this book, you will be quite embarrassed. The vocabulary is, to quote my roommate, from another century.Sure, buy the book if you want to refer to pens as Quills.I notice that Berlitz offers a book called German TODAY for quite a bit more money. But you get what you pay for, don't you?"
2,Not structured well,"The book does a good job of getting you into reading German. However, some things I feel necessary and helpful are not included such as rules for verb conjugation and a summary of vocabulary learned for the chapter. Also the sentence-by-sentence reading does not help much. There aren't many dialogues or paragraphs to read. If you are like me and like seeing that stuff, this may not be the book for you."
3,"Excellent phone, but LCD screens failed after a few years","We purchased this phone about 5 years or so ago and have been very pleased with it. It consisted of the base unit plus three cordless extension phones. One of the extension phones died within a year and was replaced under warranty. After about three years or so, the LCD screens started to fail -- only parts of the characters were displayed. This failure began about the same time on all of the phones -- so I would guess that the LCD screen components have a fairly limited life. After limping along for a couple of years with difficulty of trying to read the malformed caller id and phonebook letters and names, we replaced the system. If it wasn't for the failure of the LCD screens, I imagine that we would have continued to use it for many more years."
5,A must for Python and Red Dwarf fans,"If you like Red Dwarf and Monty Python, you must own this. If you're into Masterpiece Theatre, run away quickly.The series chronicles the (mis)adventures of Gudrun, a put-upon stonemason. His troubles begin when he is thrust into a position of authority as Head Churl for his village. The supporting characters add a lot of humor to the series, from the idiotic Thane to Gudrun's daughter, who'se approach to cooking is a combination of Julia Child and Sweeny Todd."
4,I liked this book,"The Lily series is a good, Christian series for tweenish age girls. (10-13ish) In this book, after thinking about Self-images, Lily decides it's time for Shad and Daniel and Leo to get a taste of thier own medicine. And then she (along with the Girlz), put glue on the monkey bars and Shad and his buddies stay there with thier pants falling off. But then, Lily gets a punishment with Shad. (they get paired up together for a project), but the Girlz never come clean until an incident at the river settles the whole thing. A good book for tween girls. (about loving your enemies)"
4,"Pretty good... for a ""historical""","When I purchased this book, I didn't read the summary extensively and didn't realize I was getting a ""historical,"" which typically, I don't like at all. However, I was able to get into this book enough to get hooked on the story line and read it through to the end.I agree with the review that says the second half is much better than the first, but I wouldn't necessarily label the first half as ""dull.""Overall, a good read. Not her best book, but far from her worst!"
1,Just made me feel icky.,"I know women wed earlier in the 1800s, but 16 is still stretching it, and Johansen is writing for a modern audience. I'm not sure what the problem was for me - I've read plenty of romances with young heroines & significantly older men. This one just made me uncomfortable & I had to put it down."
5,Iris's best work ever,"Another amazing book by Iris Johansen. This book was one of her best works, taking the reader into a great story of love, deception, and adventure. She captures the reader in her epic tale of a women tring to keep her promise to her mother, of the family secret. Only in her does the story unfold.The only problem with the book is that it starts to fast and everything happens to fast, so reading the book 2 time will give the reader a better understanding of what the book is about. Overall it was a great book. Iris Johansen has done it once again."
2,The Boring Scoundrel,I found this book a bit boring midway. On and on it went and finally I decided to just stop reading it. I have read other Johansen books and found them delightful but this one was a bit slow for me.
5,Wonderful romance!,"This novel made me an Iris Johanson fan! What I love about her works are her strong characters, particularly the heroines. Marianna is a strong, intelligent, creative young woman, who is not the victim of The Beloved Scoundrel, but the champion of the story. Her wit and her passion endear her not only to the handsome hero, but to the readers as well. Bravo, Ms. Johanson!"
4,Read before sleep for sweet dreams,"Originally written in French, this book offers information and history on each shop that even a Parisian can appreciate. The photos are gorgeous. You can always count on Christian Sarramon. A good introduction to some of the best in the city."
1,Waste of money,"Whomever took the book's photos should be reprimanded. Although the cover has a nice pic, it is not indicative of what's inside. The book is depressing. I really don't know why this book was printed in a large format because it only accentuates the bad photos. I immediately returned this book."
2,OK but issues,The modem router is Ok. Setup is not friendly. Need to power-cycle every 9-12 hours. OK purchase good vendor. Product is not up to expectations.
2,Hot but shallow,"Alpha male, woman in jeopardy, lots of sex & violence, you get the picture. Their relationship & her danger come out of nowhere, with neither lead-up nor development, and while there's plenty of excitement, there's not much in the way of character or plot depth. I wouldn't read a book like this in the first place if I didn't like pure fantasy entertainment, but this one's sort of like eating marshmallows when you were hoping for rich dark chocolate - a pop of sensation without complexity."
3,Good Read,"I liked the story, but didn't much care for the characters, a little unbelievable to pair these two together. Good plot, decent writing, kudos for a decent plot that kept me interested. Loved the ending- Perfect!"
3,"Good, but.......","This book was a good read, but I expected more heat. I personally think my Harliquin Blaze books are MUCH hotter than this author's books. Th story was very good, but I would have liked to have seen more passion between the characters."
2,"Meh, It Was Okay","I have been wanting to find a new romantic supsense series after reading The McCloud Brothers by Shannan McKenna so I did some research online and found out about this series. I downloaded the free chapters and liked those enough to buy the book. I really wish I hadn't spent $5 on it. It was okay. Just okay, nothing to write home about. I think my biggest problem was how fast paced it was. You know these types of books, after less than a week of knowing each other they are already madly in love and talking about marriage and babies. The ""suspense"" was pretty laughable in my opinion. I want a story that keeps me on the edge of my seat and keeps me up till 3 in the morning wanting to find out what happens next. This was neither. Needless to say I won't be reading any more from Lisa Marie Rice."
3,Meh,"I bought this book expecting excitement, suspense and hot love scenes. While the sex was plentiful, it was just plain boring. No imagination. Pretty much wham bam thank you ma'am. The characters had no depth, no real connection, and things moved way too fast to be even remotely realistic. Also, what was trying to pass as suspense was LAME. I finished it, but I will not be buying the rest of this series. Boring. If you want some good suspenseful romantic suspense, try Lora Leigh's Elite Ops and Navy Seals books."
2,I can't believe the reviews were so good...,This book was not good. It was slow and unbelievable and boring. Save your money!
4,"Good job, Lisa","I really liked the Protectors series by Lisa Marie Rice. With one SEAL, one Delta Force operator, and one Marine Force Recon Sniper these were really hot with really alpha heroes and great intrigue or suspense. This book was very much like one of the Protectors. The main male character John was alpha and HOT. I felt that the conflict was totally appropriate and believable and I really liked that it wasn't farfetched or stupid. I really liked how John handled the conflict without becoming a complete jerk. He was very much like a Linda Howard hero. I won't lie, the book was pretty steamy. But you kind of have to expect that considering the author and book description. Recommended."
5,Midnight Man,This one's a winner. I especially enjoyed the wink and homage to Suzanne Brockmann's Troubleshooters series. Lisa Rice took Brockmann's characters and put a much sexier spin on them (which I wouldn't have believed possible!) I can't wait to read the rest of the Midnight series!
2,oh well,"i know this is fiction but just didnt get the bluntness of the midnight man, and again just too much over explaining of things that could have been left out. I skipped alot of paragraghs."
1,Seriously unbelievable!,"Thought this was really a horrible read. You have a guy who is basically like ""The Terminator"". Really unbelievable storyline and I couldn't get over how truly, truly helpless Suzanne was, especially being in real estate! No depth to the characters, no delicate passion between them, and way too much ""hard"" (no pun intended) sex for my taste. Couldn't even finish it."
2,I must have missed a meeting...,"Let me start by saying that I wasn't expecting a classic, just something to pass the time. But this was disappointing even coming in with low expectations. The main characters were so unlikable, but the worst was the ""hero"", who seemed to have all the sexual self-control of a teenage boy in the midst of puberty. Did I miss a meeting? When did speed become a desirable trait in a man? This guy, literally, just can never get to 2nd base without ... losing his load...sorry what's an acceptable euphemism here? And it just gets worse and worse. I get that he's supposed to be aroused and hot for her, but geez... show a bit of restraint, it was just so uncool."
3,OK book but needed more,"Got done with the book and thought - OK this must be a series. Since I am a sucker for a series (especially with some hot scenes and an alpha male) I looked into it and low and behold there are 2 more books and I would have bought them both except they were $7 each. Now I always factor the first book (it was free)into the overall cost of the series because I appreciate the author giving you a taste of her writing style (and yes it is almost always a women author that I like), but the length of the 3 books put together (760 pages) was not worth $14. Just can't see spending over a penny or penny and a half a page on an ebook - I read too much. Would even have bought other books from LMR if the same standards didn't apply."
3,Something to pass the time.,This isn't the best book in the world. It isn't the worse. It's something to read when you are bored one afternoon or evening. It certainly could have been better. It was short and to the point. The best part was the beginning. It flat-lined from that point.
4,"A good read, especially for romantica/erotica...","Lisa Marie Rice is one of the better authors of the romantica/erotica genre. She tends to develop the relationships between her characters better than most authors of the genre - enough so that you actually care about all the sex they're having <grin>. This book was a good read, but the characters didn't have quite enough depth, and the ending was rushed. Those two drawbacks were enough to drop a star, but overall, it was well-done for the genre and I'll probably read the others in the series."
4,Sexy thriller,"Turn on the fan as this is one hot, sexy thriller. If your world is turned upside down when people are tyring to kill you, then you can only wish that you have John ""Midnight Man"" Huntington to protect you!"
5,Midnight Man--take a chance!,"Midnight Man was a great read, especially for a free book. This was my first from this author and I happily bought the 2 other books in this series: Midnight Run and Midnight Angel.The writing is fast paced and the story line and characters were well developed and the love scenes flowed well within the context of the plot--they didn't feel gratuitous which happens alot in erotic fiction.I liked that the secondary characters will have their own books and I look forward to catching up with John and Suzanne in their stories as well.A quick summary, Suzanne is looking for a tenant for her building which she developed and decorated herself. She finds John- a former Navy SEAL, decorated officer and alpha male. They quickly are attracted to each other but then she finds out that she is a target of an assassin. He, of course, comes to the rescue and vows to protect her from this unknown assailant.A great read-look forward to the next 2 books!"
2,Just a little Romantic,"Typical storyline that fell short on romance/erotica. Some parts of the story dragged because of unnecessary descriptive writing. The plot was a bit weak, and I only felt some attachment to the characters."
3,It's all pretty much been said.,"Yeah, I got suckered in too. Nowhere on the cover does it hint that the book focuses on preaching and spreading the gospel more effectively, which although is not the only benefit of the lesson (as the author is quick to point out) it is clearly the main direction. I haven't finished reading it yet, I just wanted to voice my unexpected surprise at the overtone. I think that ultimately it will provide good points in communication effectiveness, I'm already seeing the same tips mentioned by Dale Carnegie and other interpersonal skill educators."
4,Great work,This book has helped me in my Sunday School teaching as it has shown me how to make the stories of the Bible more interesting for the children.
5,Loaded with practical tips,"This author really broke down the process in sinple steps, but was not rigid in the use of them. Great tips for a beginner in overcoming the fear of public presentations."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this book to learn to improve my storytelling skills but all I got was a book about jesus and god where I can't relate to at all.Every sentence of this book is about God and priests.Now I can see how storytelling could be a good thing for priests to learn, but in that case the book should still be objective and maybe at the end have a special chapter how this can be used for priest, but instead this is a book only for priests and fanatics which you can maybe translate into other uses.So sure, if you are not a priest you may still be able to use this if you put extra much effort to think how this can be used in other ways than just telling the bible, but I would rather recommend you to get a real book written by someone how takes his time to think about the answer of the stuff he writes about instead of just saying it's gods will."
4,"Good Knife, Sheath could use improvment.","These Knives are Great, Good steel, Rugged Tough utility type blade, and holds an edge well.The Downside?The Sheath, it could have been made so much better.From the Dimensions and shape of it you would think it could be used in an Ambidextrous manner, but it can't (WHY?) It only comes in Black (this is minor but other color options would have been good) the sheath has a very rugged design to it (rivets & metal plates) yet uses velcro instead of snaps (would snaps really have cost that much more? I doubt it).If someone Finds a Replacement/3rd party mfr Sheath for these, please let me know.Would have Rated it 5 Stars if the Sheath was a little better."
3,for the money its ok,"ok its a really cool looking knife, but its pretty heavy, the sheath is good, the blade doesn't come super sharp, but decent, the blade is also very wide so it takes a lot to cut through things(i tried on cardboard) its definitely got a cool factor, but not very practical"
4,Like A Party On CD,"I love this CD even though a lot of people bash. It is a live CD therfore it shouldn't sound exactly like the studio versions. I agree at times the mix is a little rough but still great. I saw VH on the tour promoting this CD back in '93 and it is still one of the greatest concerts I've ever been to. Alot of people feel Sammy is not the half the showman that DLR is err! was but that's bull. I like the Hagar and Roth eras of VH but VH just seemed more like a true band with Sammy where Roth was always trying to hog the spotlight. Sammy does a great job on ""Ain't Talkin Bout Love"". The only Roth song on here I feel that is not up to par is ""Panama"". Sure there are some flaws sound wise but once you get past that it's great."
1,Are you other reviewers DEAF??,"The performances on this album are great. I would love to be able to listen to this album and enjoy it, but I just can't. I can't enjoy it. Why? It's because it sounds like it was recorded on a ""My First Sony"" tape recorder. The sound quality is AWFUL! This album should go down in history as the poorest quality live recording *ever*. It's muddy and all drowned out sounding. A concert recorded on professional equipment should sound far better than this does; I've heard bootlegs that concert-goers have captured on portable cassette recorders that sound better than this. I still hang on to it because I'm one of those guys that likes to have *everything* a band puts out. I haven't listened to it in years, though. It's *that* bad."
3,avg live album cld have been so much better!!!!!,"the thing thats wrong with this is that its basically just f.u.ck with a few roth popular songs , wld u prefer a live version of spanked or a live version of mean street?? u c what i mean . yes disappointin , cld of been great , but no hagar bein selfish as usual. GEES THE GREAT SONGS THEY CLD OF PUT ON THIS!! runnin w the devil!, im the one! unchained! , etc , thats why its avg , shame there will never b another one"
1,A Boring Sleeper,Too long on the Sammy and guitar noise although that is Eddie's trademark sound if you like a lot of it. Save your money for the earlier stuff with Roth.
1,"Boring,boring,boring","I bought this CD, listened to it twice and then pawned it. Repeated listenings of this performance are impossible. It is so boring and stale. I also owned the live video, and never got through it once. Wait for a live Van Halen album during the David Lee Roth era. It's your only hope."
2,Live? I don't think so!,"Just read Sammy Hagar's autobiography and he states in that, that this album is full to the brim with overdubs from Eddie, Alex and subsequently himself. Granted, so have a lot of 'live' albums been notoriously in the past, but few have freely admitted to it. However, it's Hagar's word so clearly it's only one side of the story - but I happen to believe him. This, from a life long David Lee Roth & Van Halen fan."
4,Pretty Cool!,"This is pretty cool example of how tight Van Halen really is. The songs are as good if not better than the studio recordings--the stage is the only place where you can create that special energy.My only complaint is that Sammy slaughtered the Dave stuff(chanting Right Now in the middle section of Panama!?! How cheesy is that!) Sam IMO doesn't come close to Diamond David Lee Roth, but he does a great job anyways. Check this sucka out!"
3,Less-than-energetic effort,"I have seen VH live twice (once with DLR & once with Sammy). Both concerts were great, far outweighing this lackluster performance. Only Eddie's solo manages to save this unergetic effort. Sammy's voice sounds tired and Eddie actually sounds a little sloppy at times."
2,Not the best Van Halen,"I know some people will disagree, but I did not care for this album. I thought I would be hearing more of the older Van Halen done with Diamond Dave. There is a good Who cover of ""Won't get fooled again"" but, overall I would recommend not buying the album."
3,Where's the Live Dave-Era Album?,"Well, I'm not a huge fan of the Van-Hagar lineup, but I explore all eras of the band to be fair in judgement. I saw the video of Live Right Here... and I have to admit it was fun to watch. The solo spots being the highlights. Sam doing the Roth-era songs is just embarrassing, and you can just skip right over his acoustic-guitar-solo-folk spot.(shudder!) Anyway, I reccommend renting the video (If you can still find it) because I don't think I could get through this album with out the visuals. (Espesially Mighty Mike's Jack Daniel's bass) Where's the 1984 tour live album?"
3,Not bad but this band should've been renamed Van Hagar.,"I'm a fan of Van Halen, with the ORIGINAL lineup that included David Lee Roth. While the sound quality on this CD is pretty good, it's not VH to me. At this point in their career the Van Halen bros are branching out with piano, combined with Sammy's high pitched tone. Just doesn't cut it for me. However, the sound here is clean. The best part of this CD for me is Anthony's bass playing, Eddie's guitar playing and ""Aint Talkin Bout Love"". I just don't understand why these guys didn't record earlier era VH songs for this CD. I'm sure Sammy could've sang those DL Roth songs. Not a bad CD but I will never buy a Sammy-era VH. Van Hager era songs are just not as good to me. Their a different band."
1,This Book Condones Sex Acts Between Children,"Not only are the views of the author perverse, they are incorrect. Children do not want sex acts with other children. Only pedophiles do."
5,Aussie indie band kicks arse,"This Aussie indie band is great. Especially good on this LP is Morning Light and The Devil in me. Catchy tunes, sweet harmonies."
4,Works well for the distances I need,"The scope works well on my .22. However, the remote switch on the laser was defective and one battery was dead. The button switch didn't thread on well but since I had the button switch from another, I used it. I find the scope easy to use... fast to find the target. I've had the same scope on my pellet rifle and it has stayed dead on for several years."
3,Nothing new but still fun,This game was very much fun. I wasn't expecting anything new out of it. It really just is three old games in one. If you like the games before then now you can just have them to travel with.
5,an amazing fighter,i think this game is awesome it has good depth to it and its down right fun. its by far one of the best fighter I'v ever played the only challenge i had to get over was was the d-pad on the PSP to me it dose not work the best for fighters like this because it wouldn't always respond for me at first. but if u can get over that fact and u have the patience for the loading screens (it takes a little bit to load the next area) i think u love this game as much as i do.
2,"fun, but not worth it","three hours after i bought this game i had beaten every stage. i like to focus on the positive, so i will say the colors and graphics, though cartoonish, are eyecatching. other than that its not much more positive about it. i believe if it cost maybe $15 or less, i would feel better about it. i believe if you spend $40 on this, when you play it you are going to be upset. unless you have 40 bucks to throw away. nice simple fighting game, yes. worth 40 dollars, not even close."
2,Bad compilation of some so-so games,"I think I bought this purely out of some nostalgic sense of duty, as the professional review I'd read of it was unflattering. I should have listened to the pros on this one. This game presents nothing new to anyone who's played a Darkstalkers game in the past, the graphics definitely don't come close to other titles available for the PSP (which tells me the developers don't even care about this product), and some of the button combos that you are required to punch through are near impossible to accomplish. All in all, the only challenge I got from playing this game was to get the characters to do their more advanced moves, but even without them I could still win through and beat the game. Total waste of hard earned money."
5,Nice Bow,"I ordered this bow because of the decent reviews it got, but also because i have wanted to start archery. This is a very nice beginners bow and i was surprised by the price i thought i would be paying much more.i got the Feather Fletched Easton XX75 Blues Arrows 6-packthey are nice arrows and they work well with this bow"
1,rubbish,a never seen such a peice of junk when i opened the box the bow was cracked that was bad enough i shot an arrow and the string broke the most useless bow in the world the bow went to bits when the string snaped
5,"Good, strong bow","For the price of $30-$40, this is an amazing buy. It may not be elaborately carved like the Bow of Legolas, or anything, but that really won't matter much when you get it. It took me awhile to decipher the instructions on how to string it, but once I found it, it's quite easy.One sad thing is it doesn't come with its own arrows. You have to buy them separately, but I'm not quite sure where. I'm proud to say I managed to make my own by carving it out of a stick and gluing duck feathers on, but that's not something everyone would probably want to do.I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to have a really cool model bow, whether its just for playing, or if you actually getting introduced to real archery."
5,A recurve bow just like when I was a kid,My new Titan 60 inch recurve 30# fiberglass bow functions as advertised. I am grateful to WTA for providing prompt service when we had questions. It's about time we had a choice when buying a basic bow to learn archery. Next; a compound bow...
4,great for the beginner,we reallyliked this bow. its a good recurve for the beginner and intermediate. its light wieght and easy to handle. great product.
2,Not As Good as Current Live Performances,"I recently (2009) heard Frederic Yonnet live over the radio at the Rosslyn, VA jazz festival and was amazed! I was hoping the CD would have some of that creativity and energy. His performance at the Rosslyn, VA jazz festival struck me as being truly a new voice on harmonica. Maybe it's because he's grown a lot as a muscian since the CD was recorded, or maybe the CD song choice isn't my cup-of-tea, but I do not find the CD engaging."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie should have been a tribute to the heroes who gave their lives to save so many others on 9/11. Instead, they are portrayed as vigilantes who killed themselves. All they had to go on was the black boxes and the phone calls made from the plane, the rest is conjecture and, in my humble opinion, complete and absolute bull s***! Nothing like this happened on that plane. They took a tragic story and hollywoodized it until it became a mockery. I was not impressed."
1,This purchase was a mistake.,"This was a very disappointing purchase, since I thought it was a book written by a good friend named John Anderson -- but as he pointed out when I shared my disappointment with him, he said that the first published ""John Anderson"" was several centuries older than he is...I threw away two of the copies and kept one -- only to put it on the book shelves."
3,"Helpful with older toddlers, not younger ones","While I did like this book and it's straight-forward and caring approach as to how to deal with young children, I did not find that it was helpful for me as the parent of a 2-year old child. I purchased this book right after my daughter turned 2 and had very high hopes that it would help me in dealing with her, as she's a very smart and high-energy child. Unfortunately, I found that most of the tips and anecdotes were not practical for a younger toddler whom is still learning to talk and learn how to express herself AND whom has yet to develop the right skills to really pay attention to what Mommy and Daddy are saying. I'll definitely keep the book and come back to it when my daughter gets older, but right now I am still searching for a book that will help me along while my daughter is still so young."
3,A Good Quick Reference Guide,"If you are a parent-book junkie like me, this book doesn't really have anything new or different from many of the others. The usual themes of positive reinforcement, parental consistency, staying calm, letting your child feel understood but not get away with naughtiness are all covered. The format is fun, though, and lends itself to a quick parent look-up for when you are feeling crazed."
1,The Pocket Parent,"I did not care for this book and I only bought it because it was suggested after reading SETTING LIMITS WITH YOUR STRONG WILLED CHILD. It was very different from the SETTING LIMITS book and did not share the same philosophy. I bought two copies, one to share with my daughter and I would sooner throw it out then have her read this book. I plan on returning them to amazon. I do not recommend this book."
2,Pocket Size Is Too Small,It's a great idea but the pocket size is too small especially for grandparents. There is also nothing new in the entire book and the humor is lacking.
2,Ok-not exactly the HG of parenting books,"Just an ok book-I like that you can look up what you need very easily except for having to read an entire book to find what your looking for-and they do have some useful tips but I think its just very very basic tips. Nothing groundbreaking. Im dealing with a toddler and various toddler-type issues and though they address them in the book, I still feel like I need more as the tips are just basic practical run of the mill."
4,The Pocket Parent,"Handy book with quick references to different problem areas on how to deal with your ""strong willed"" child."
3,quick reference,"As other reviewers have said, this is a quick reference to many questions you might have about your toddler's behaviors & ""quick"" ways to help diffuse frustrating situations. I haven't finished the book because I started to read Dr. Karp's ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block"". I read reviews on both books before purchasing and decided to give them both a chance. Although Dr. Karp suggests that our toddlers are ""little cavepeople"", his way of discipline through very few words does work. Once you bring yourself down to your child's level of language - they listen to you. I'm glad I purchased this book even though I'm finding the ""Happiest Toddler"" book to be more helpful - this one is good for my husband to flip open to a section (which are only a few pages) to give a quick read."
3,"Parenting, not problem solving","This is a book of parenting advice, not problem solving advice. I was looking for creative ideas for how to keep my toddler from screaming when I wash his hair, or, as another reviewer noted, how to get him to quit picking his nose. I think most people who would be interested in this book are beyond the diaper bag stage, and I don't know in whose pocket it would fit. The book does contain good advice about setting limits, respecting the child, and modeling appropriate behavior - pretty standard stuff for 21st century parents. I will use it as a reference book, but you won't see me whipping it out in the middle of Wal-Mart."
4,Great Advice!,"Being a first time mom of a now 2 year old, I wanted to make sure I have everything possible to help me be the best mom I can for my son! This book is really great! It's written by real people who have truly been there! You will laugh and you will realize that no book can raise a child, but THIS book really can help you when you need that extra guidance at the time you are at your wits end! It's a very reasonable price; which at first made me think it wouldn't be good. I was wrong. They made it afforadable to ensure everyone can get their own copy! I highly recommend it!"
5,"Practical, sanity-saving wisdom for every parent!","As a parent of a strong-willed preschooler, The Pocket Parent is THE place to go for all the answers! The A to Z format allows me to pinpoint an issue I'm having with my child, whether it's anger, mealtime issues, tantrums etc., then I flip to the right page for some very positive and easy-to-follow advice with a touch of humor. The book is filled with personal anecdotes...some made me laugh, some touched me profoundly..all were very insightful.This is the best parenting resource book I've found. It's easy and enjoyable to read. Best of all, it's so warmly-written and supportive, it's like getting a big reassuring hug with every turn of the page.Thanks to Gail Reichlin and Caroline Winkler for a terrific book filled with practical, sanity-saving wisdom. It's perfect for any parent or caregiver of young children!"
3,"flexible, fun advice",This book offers some good suggestions and tips with out being dogmatic or condescending. It isn't an overall system of parenting that you can use to guide you.
3,a whimsical stocking stuffer,"True to the title the Pocket Parent does fit exactly there. However, I'm not sure how many parents will carry it around for those ""quick fix"" moments (a creative packaging concept?). The book does have some helpful hints for the little ones which we all need as parents from time to time. The tips, however, seem to be more of a witty compilation of tried and true tricks from a collective group of parents. This same group seemed to throw in the supportive comments to one another for good measure. All in all it seems to be on par with most of what's out there. As a parent, I was looking for more in-depth ideas from professionals and ways to develop my child for the long term - not just in the grocery store. Also, I could do without the peer-parent coddling of my worth as I try to manage the children."
4,useful read,"This book is an easy resource to use for a family's specific need. It is also to the point, which makes it a worthwhile purchase."
4,Good book,This reference book has many different examples and techniques on dealing with young children. Nice guide for parents at a good price.
3,good parenting,This was a good parenting handbook and it needs to be carried daily. There are great tips and advice for young parents.
5,"Effective, succinct, topics quickly accessible","I am a former preschool teacher, mom of 2 grown children and a grandmother of twins who just turned 3 years old. I bought this book because I saw a moms thread recommending it and I like to stay on top of the world of preschoolers. This book is a godsend for anyone who cares for young children. It is helpful to read ahead and create a picture as to how to deal with issues as they arise and have a game plan in place for those inevitable periods when time or patience is in short supply. I was just communicating with a young mom of a 3 year old who is acting out and this is the first book I recommended:-) I particularly like the snippets on tantrums:-) The book also provides quotes from parents who have successfully dealt with situations and share how it is they handled them. I highly recommend!"
1,This current price is an example of Kodak's greed,This product was being sold here for $299.95 about 2 months ago. People gave it good reviews so it sold out. Seems like Kodak held back on supply to maximize the 'shortage of supply' effect and now come back with a $200 higher price. Kodak thinks that people lusting after this product are stupid. Are We?
5,Excellent product!,"This product is very good and has kept our frog healthy for many years. If you buy it I suggest buying the larger size, as it is more economical."
4,Best of the Bunch,"I own a half-dozen of these DVDs and I think this is the best.I took away a star because, while the best I've found, it doesn't really address the audience that it professes to be aimed at.The problem with all of these DVDs is that they are essentially teaching how to perform the false shuffles and cuts, but don't address the best ways to detect the moves.Just my two pence..."
4,Chants Du Kurdistan,"This is one more masterpiece from Shiwan, music is excellent though some westerners object the lyrical style. Of course Kurdish music is not just about music, it is pure resistance to genocidal regimes of middle east whose only desire is to destroy and/or appropriate anything Kurdish, including music."
4,decent battery,"They did a great job of promptly fixed a DOA battery, no questions asked. I was impressed by that. The battery is a 4400 mah, not the 4700 mah that comes with the D600. I did not find any memtion of this descrepency on their web page."
1,Junk,I received the item in a timely manner and that was the last good thing about it. It would not take a full charge and now it is completely dead. Waste of money and time.
1,Deceitful shipping practices,"Seller practiced deceitful shipping practices when they indicated item was shipping from the USA. When item was received, it was actually mailed from Hong Kong. Since the battery did not work in my computer, and due to return policies overseas, I am unable to return the battery and am stuck with it."
2,Very little improvement,"Ordered these replacement batteries for my Dell 600M. I should have been skeptical about the units, given their $19 per unit cost. Followed the instructions prior to first to charge the unit for 6 to 8 hours. After doing this the laptop was powered on and used. 1.5 hours of use tops,initially. After use and draining the battery completely, several times the best usage I have received has been 1 hour 45 minutes. Don't waste your money on these, spend the extra few dollars and get a better quality battery."
3,Laptop Battery for Dell Inspiron 600M Latitude D600,The battery was ok but after a few months of use it stop charging i was wonder if was the battery or computer but it end up being problems with the battery i don't know what the computer guy did but got it to work again
5,Has Worked Reliably,We bought this replacement battery about 3 months ago. It has worked very well during this time. Holds a good charge - no problems.
1,TRASH!!!!,I rarely explain ratings or rate things period. But I felt this was such a terrible stand up I had to to try to help someone save there money. It was awkwardly unfunny. I couldn't even finish watching it. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. I like Charlie Murphy on Chappel Show but as a stand up comedian TRASH!
1,Charlie Should Apologize...,What happen? Charlie is a funny guy and I saw this and it bombed bad. why? it seemed more a social commentary or just him plain speaking than even trying? It's not funny which is strange. I hope he does another special and corrects this.
1,I was there,"I went to this show a couple years back at the Wilbur Theatre where it was filmed. I have not watched the DVD because I never want to relive that horrible night of absolute boredom! The venue was a dry venue to begin so on top of watching the worst excuse for stand-up I have ever witnessed, I was sober the whole damn time. Do not waste your $20 on this DVD. I paid $100 to fall asleep in the front row. Horrible."
1,Uncomfortable to watch,Did not buy it but saw a portion of it on Comedy Central. Watched about ten minutes before I had to turn it off. It's never easy to watch a stand up comedian bomb especially for an hour. I don't know why Comedy Central even bothered to air the performance. He overshot his abilities as a story teller without the support of Dave Chapelle's genius. I think it would have been better for Charlie if this special was just swept under the rug.
5,What can I say? Just great,"Great album. And the voice this man has!!! It's like several different voices in one. He's being compared to Joe Cocker and other Zuccheros - not unjustly, he's from the same vocal family. But the power, the range od his voice - and his incredible versality make him unique in the world. And this album does him more justice than his debut one. Really good songs, especially Gerald De Palmas' ""Et si on dormait"", also ""Pendant que mes cheveux poussent"", ""Les filles"".But the best ones, in my view, are three songs closing the album: ""Ne me parlez plus d'elle"", ""Un premer regard"" and the beautiful, beautiful blues ""Une derniere fois encore"". Good job,Garou,now we are waiting for more! I know that he recorded an English-language album too, but for some mysterious reasons Sony Music refuses to release it. Why is that? He's too good for Sony, maybe?"
5,refreshingly different,"'Reviens' is a unique album that instead of following the same pop formula of 'Seul'; Garou, the lyricists, the producers have opted to go in a different direction...by showcasing and extending Garou's vocal style, intensity and range.The songs contained explore refreshingly different and ecclectic styles from the blues of 'Une dernière fois encore' to the old gospel spiritual sound of 'Pendant que mes cheveux poussent' to the guitar heavy rock of the 70s in 'Hemingway' to the classically French 'Les filles'.It's difficult to find an album, where the quality of the production, musicianship, the writing, and the vocals don't follow the standards set by many of today's mainstream cookie cutter ""artists"".This is an album worth buying, listening to and keeping.Here's to a long lasting and fulfilling career for Garou and Company.Thank you."
4,Letter from Singapore,"Well first hear Garou from the Cable TV. He had a great voice control and a unique voice. Got the first album thru friends from Canada actually. To bad that the album is not in Singapore market. With the comeback of the second album, I believe that it will be great than the first album. Hope that this album could be in Singapore Market as I will definately get the album rather than listening or download from computer as in Singapore, we believe in buying original and not piracy CD. Believe that this will be one of the best album in international market."
4,"Great read for the ""want to know everything type""","A great book for those unique individuals who are on a quest to ""know everthing"". The author clearly explains everything associated with death. The title is what caught my eye!"
3,"Interesting, but...","The best way I could describe the layout of this book is cheesy. A short book, even though it's printed in Courier type, this is an easy read in under a couple hours. There are some fascinating revelations in this book...if you have a morbid curiosity (as I do.) Still, some parts of the book weren't as detailed as others."
4,It works,"Needed this basic replacement piece. Nothing too complicated to catching ashes. Hard part is taking bottom of grill apart to get the new one on. Wish it was a little deeper to ""catch"" everything."
