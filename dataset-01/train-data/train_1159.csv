5,Worked exactly as expected,We bought multiple of this product and it works perfectly and fits perfectly on every laptop. We are very satisfied!
3,fonemate is not for everyone,"i purchased this unit as i am a big James Bond fan, but to my surprise this unit is not compatible with everything. I have a Vista system and the software that comes with this unit is only for XP. i have other units and i did install this in my other xp and it works great. but i had to find out the hard way it is not vista compatible and i did have a chance to speak with a service tech and there is no software for vista. So please make sure you have an xp."
3,Good but it does not work on a MAC.,"Good item but it does not work on a Mac or some PCs. The company that I bought it from reimbursed me, so I was happy with their professionalism.Slick item if you can get it to work. Pretty cool looking design."
1,Doesnt work for me Have AT&T Sim card...,"I installed all software got the green light to light up.Does not even show up on my computer anywhere.Have tried over and over.I am going to buy new computer in future with windows vista or 7.I now running Windows XP,So if it wont work here its a $[...] paperweight.Just want to get all my numbers to redo my phone and not have to type everything over.Well its seems like its hit or miss is it worth $[...] bucks your choice........"
1,It doesn't work!,Instruction does not reflect what I see on the screen. Can not read any information out of SIM card.
3,Not Bad for a School Assignment,"The Investment Biker: Around the World with Jim Roger would not have been a book I would have chosen to read on my own but, after being assigned to it I would recommend it to those interested in world economy, travel and BMW motorcycles. One follows Roger around the world on his 22-month expedition of six continents and numerous economies and societies. Along with his girlfriend, Tabitha, Roger, a Wall Street legend, entertains with antecedents from his trip, while giving valuable insight of each economy he comes across. Roger is known from revitalizing the ""Sleeping Beauty"" that is the Austrian stock market. Over the 65,067 miles traveled BMW motorcycles and thousands more by boat, plane and train, Roger experiences first hand global societies, international economies and how they are seceding and failing around the world."
3,"Great adventure, disappointing author...","If you enjoy travel adventure and the conquering of adversity, this book is for you! Plenty of close calls to keep you interested!If you're interested in international investment, you will find a fair amount of data here as well. Some of this data is already far out of date, as the world changes quickly.Motorcyclists will find the tale rather amusing, as Rogers demonstrates that he was ill-prepared for a journey of this magnitude. His choice of machines for the trip was but the first error of many on his part.One irritating theme throughout the book was Rogers' use of ""dollar diplomacy."" His solution to any on-the-road problem was the liberal application of US currency. He completely misses the likelihood that many of his problems with corrupt officials were the direct result of his flashy display of wealth! It was evident from the book that he expected everyone he encountered to play by American rules. Truly an ""Ugly American"" abroad."
4,"Incisive, forward thinking fiscal philosophy with real punch","The book was a gift. I probably wouldn't have bought it even though I am a cross contry motorcycle rider myself. After about 50 pages I put it down, but when I again picked it up weeks later, I was totally absorbed. Riding a motorcycle around the world is enough for a book, but throw in the wisdom of the seasoned international investor on the foreign markets he visited along with his personal observations of the curtural and economic aspects of these nations, and it is worthwhile reading. Building block by block he constructs the economic model for the collapse of the United States based on ancient and modern history."
5,Great book!,"This just a great book.Period. Have read it twice. I keep wondering when his second book will (if ever) come out. I would recommend it to anyone, anywhere, anytime. If you like exciting travel stories and great investment advise and insight- this is THE book."
3,More Biker than Investment,"The book actually has not much to do with investemnts. Except for some global economic predictions, the book is on travelling the world. Do not read it for investment stories except if you are interested in lines like: The Chinese are building roads, construction workers who make them used to farm sheeps, of which the cashmere is exported. Therefore go short in fashion brands when the Chiense start building roads...."
1,Another Ugly American Abroad,"I heard about this book when it first came out, but wasn't interested in subject or author so never read it. Then I saw notice of his third wedding (not to his travel companion Tabitha, but another blonde that he'd just traveled with. This time in a car, customized, of course.) and mention of the book. I decided to buy it. Was put off by his arrogant, obnoxious style. I just skimmed through it and passed it on to a friend. A waste of money and my time."
1,Reveals Arrogance and Incompetence with first 20 pages,"....he talks constantly about the fact that he is having a sexualrelationship with his younger and poorer companion.He immedeatelydecides that he won't be making any investments in Ireland. In fact he rejects each of the 3 Is Ireland, Israel and India. What a Genius.He did think the far east was a good bet.Hmmm considering when this book was written did he really need to travel to work this out.Repulsive personally and mundane professionally."
2,Investment Boner?,"As a BMW motorcyclist and long-distance touring afficionado, I found the book diverting as a travelogue. However, it became annoying as a the author's self promotion, not only professionally but personally, began to intrude. Mr. Rogers siezed every opportunity to remind us that his travelling companion, Ms. Estabrook, was not merely a platonic friend. This apparently needed to be alluded to often, as she had thoughtfully prepared for the journey by actually taking motorcycle repair classes, and would probably otherwise have been mistaken for a mechanic rather than a tootsie. By way of example, he helpfully lists ""birth control pills"" rather than the boringly generic ""prescription medications"" in his travelers' packing checklist appendix. If Viagra had been available at the time, one wonders if it would have merited special mention as well?"
4,Not a Skilled Writer-But a Great Story,I must say that the writing was less than impressive. I think the publisher should have given him a little more help. On the other hand the story is amazing! You have to respect a man who would blaze through the who's who of the worlds most dangerous countries even if his few attempts at flowery language make you want to gag
3,Economics Lecture Disguised as a Travelogue,"It's lot of fun to travel around the world with Jim Rogers and listen to him describe the world and fulminate against the folly of governments.It's also fun to think about the things he got right and the things he got wrong (US exchange controls by 2000, for instance) and consider why he thought what he did and how things actually unfolded.He advocates getting out and living your dream; sound advice, that. He also predicts that Clinton will be the last Democrat ever elected an American president because of irresponsible policies pursued for eight decades, and the collapse of our society because the Republicans aren't fundamentally any better. Certainly with that hanging over your head, you'd be much better off going for a bike ride."
3,"Entertaining, but weird.","This is not a bad book...I repeat, not bad. But it's, well, just weird. I don't know, maybe I'm one of those unenlightened dolts who likes to have my dots connected, but when this was over, I had a few more questions than I'm normally comfortable with I finish a book. I like the whole Sam Spade meets the Evil Dead thing, and if you're in a mood for something dark, welcome home. But if you want to be able to say, when it's all over, ""I understand"", well, good luck!"
5,Excellent existential noir,"I started reading this on the beach one Saturday afternoon. Good thing my kids know how to swim, because within an hour I wasn't looking up from the book.The originality of this detective novel shines around it like blue sometimes does PI Jimmy Miles, one of the undead who still has unfinished business to take care of on earth, although neither he nor his fellow ""Sailors"" know exactly what their unfinished business entails, nor precisely the rules of their unnatural existence. This existential angst, amplified by the prose style, adds noir on top of noir. And the LA setting is both literally and metaphorically perfect for Jimmy Miles's cruising in search of multiple answers, both internal to himself, and external to the decades-old murders he is asked to solve. The fact that no pat answers, even to the ""who"" of the who-dun-it part, are arrived at is part of this remarkable novel's appeal."
2,I Should Have Listened to the Bad Reviews...,What a mess is about all I can say. You don't find out until the very end of the book just what the supernatural portion of this book really is and by that time I didn't care. So much of this book is confusing because it isn't explained up front. The prose is choppy -- the references to characters and places are very old school. Just an odd book that wasn't worth the time investment to read.
2,The Slow,"The problem with this novel is that it never really goes anywhere. The supernatural element is hardly intriguing and the mystery itself is a real bore. Even the author's description of the Hollywood nightlife and the disco era fail to captivate. Sunset strip comes across as little more than a cheap cliche, and the whole thing just plods along at a deadening pace. I guess the book is okay if you've got an evening or two to kill, but it isn't going to change your life."
2,"cool idea, but confusing","It's an interesting idea and since it seems like Vining has set up a potential series of books with the same character, maybe it will get better. The scenes don't flow together very well and the ending is downright disappointing."
4,Phantom of the Opera,I enjoyed and am enjoying this film--not the usual Nelson Eddy but still good. DVD received in good condition.
3,erm....,"I thought this movie was OK, bt it could have been better. Some scenes were unrealistic towards the end, but hey, it was 1943, they weren't able to do better, i think. but What Christine does in the end is quie interesting. I kinda liked the Phantom's mood swings though, one sec he's shy and quiet, the next time you see him, he's wacko. I wish, though that it had followed the story line a bit more."
5,the Phantom of the Opera a great tale and a lasting tale,"it is a great story of the Phantom under the Opera House of Paris, in the sewers. the newest movie of the Broadway hit by Andrew Lloyd Webber had finally been filmed. and i have seen the super great silent film of this title with Lon Chaney Sr and it is spectacular. this is the Hollywood movie version with Claude Rains as the Phantom. it is good, not great, and not epic. but a good entertaining film. Rains is one of my very favorite character actors of all time. Nelson Eddy is so miss cast. and i don't even remember the girl singer in it. but the chandelier is still scary."
5,Glad I finally got this on DVD,"I have loved this movie for years - however, I've had it on VHS. I kept telling myself that I'd get it on DVD at some point, and finally found it! The condition was as promised and shipped quickly."
4,Gift for my Uncle,I ordered this as a gift for my Uncle who loves old Nelson Eddy movies on DVD. As soon as it arrived he played it and just loved it. The DVD came faster than expected and lived up to his expectations.
5,vintage musical,"This DVD is just GLORIOUS... the use of technicolor back in 1943 is outstanding. The transfer is impeccable. The film obviously has been stored to keep it preserved in pristine condition. This is a perfect example of why I thought T.V. would never catch on to the masses. T.V. was such a snowy, fuzzy mess, the talent and the one dimentional quality of the medium made me think it would never be popular.... Was I wrong.... wrong....wrong...wrong.The masses could be entertained by watching a T.V. test pattern."
3,OK movie,This movie has very little phantom and the opera is very heavy plus there is to much of it. If you are looking for something like the Broadway show don't get this.
4,Phantom Remade,"In this remake of the 1925 classic, Claude Rains portrays the masked Phantom with Susanna Foster as Christine and Edgar Barrier as Raoul.This film is full of vivid color and marvelous opera sequences. This film focuses much more on the opera than the Phantom. The film's style precedes that of Lloyd Webber's musical.This version takes considerable liberties with Leroux's original story. Some events are still intact, such as the chandelier crash scene and, of course, the unmasking. However, some scenes like the masked ball are not included at all. The Phantom's back story was also completely revised. With all these changes, fans that are looking for and updated, colorized version of the 1925 film may be disappointed. If they had made many more changes, I could hardly call this a Phantom of the Opera movie.Overall, if you are looking for a different take on the Phantom story, you may like this version."
3,Didn't Follow the Book A Lot,"Ok, it was a pretty good movie, but it didn't follow the book a lot. I noticed a mistake too (I'm not picky, I just love finding mistakes in movies)! When the Phantom is sawing the chain holding the chandiler, after a while, he moves to the other side of the link, then it shows the performance again, and when it shows him sawing again, he's sawing on the side he was originally on. It sounds a little confusing. Claude Raines didn't get enough screen time, I think, and the other characters got plenty of time. It didn't seem fair."
4,A great universal movie wasted with old music.,"This has to be the best universal movie ever made. It contains a masterpiece plot and a group of great actors with good parts...... but then the old fat lady came to sing! That old fat lady who sings the 20 min song wastes the role of Claude Rains. Claude Rains is very scary as the phantom, though he looks very young for his age. Sue Foster is very beliveable as the young actress, and Nelson Eddy is horrid as a viewer. It seems that the movie has many sparks, but just can't add up enough scares to kill the fat lady!"
2,"Way, way, way","too musical for what it's supposed to be. It's just not a good remake, despite claude Rains; best efforts. The problem is a weak script, weak supporting cast, and most of all, weak make-up. The ""story"" of the Phantom was interesting, but as a whole, the film is, unfortunately, well, weak. Catch it on TV"
1,"Phantom Eh? More like the ""Invisible Man.""",An utter Disgrace to the Book. The book mentions nothing about acid being thrown in Erik's face. Why is it hollywood ALWAYS Screws this Great book up? Only the 1925 Lon Chaney version has done the book any justice.
1,Bad bad bad bad BAD...,"This film was awful and nearly NOWHERE near the original story. First off, the Phantom is hardly even IN the movie! There are TWO Raouls fighting over Christine, and that's pretty much it! Oh, I thought it had some pretty Opera music, but besides that, I beg of you, don't waste your money, please."
3,Not That Bad,"This Phantom movie was pretty good.It had a good musical score,a good storyline and a pretty good Phantom.It was hardly the original Leroux story at all (wich I never liked that much anyway).The idea of acid being throne on him was a little far fechted.Lets face it.The chance of someoe surviving having acid thrown on them is very slim (especialy when it takes them five min. to wash it of).Plus I'm sure that the acid landed on his entire face and in his hair yet when he is unmasked only a small portion of the left side of his face has burned.Even then the burn looked like a bad rash.Now for the good things about the film.The cast of characters was interesting.Christine was normal exept her last name was changed.I also found it interesting that Cristine was envied by three men The Phantom, Raoule, and the tenor from the opera whose name slips my mind.I recomend this film to anyone who is obsessed with The Phantom of the Opera."
5,Phantom of the Opera VHS tape,"Even though this video was a used product, it was in excellent condition, and arrived in its original box. The cost for this classic was entirely reasonable at $3.49 plus $2.49 shipping and handling."
4,A GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENT,Igave this as a gift. The color and sound track were amazing. I enjoyed the fact that it was on DVD and the technology and color were great.
5,NO LONGER A PHANTOM!!,"I SAW THIS MOVIE AS A CHILD ON TV MANY YEARS AGO WHEN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING INCLUDED CLASSIC MOVIES ON A DAILY BASIS. IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. ALTHOUGH THE FILM DOES NOT INCLUDE A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE CHARACTER CHRISTINE, AND HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT OF THE ACTOR, CLAUDE RAINS, AS IT IS PORTRAYED IN THE BOOK; I AM STILL GLAD THAT I FINALLY HAVE COPY OF THIS MOVIE. I AM A LOVER OF ""LONG HAIRED"" MUSIC, AND I WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, JUST TO SEE THE OPERA SEQUENCES. THE SPECIAL FEATURES ARE A DEFINITE ADDED TREAT. THANKS!!"
4,SO CUTE,I got this to go with my son's robot/outer space themed room. It is very tough so far and has a nice tick! My toddler likes to shake it so the hammer hits the bells. And it even tells time!
5,Therapeutic soaps,"Attractive packaging, great smelling, and long lasting soaps My husband and I really enjoy them and will purchase them again."
2,Did not like the smell,"I was looking for something that smelled more like sage, but this one smells like just cedar. I know this is just personal taste but did no like the smell. I thought it was a little stinky. Also not such a good value. It is a pretty small soap bar.I was disappointed."
1,Very disgusted,"This bowling game does not work at all. We have tried it on three different TV's (one of the TV's is brand new which we bought just for this game usage). We don't know if the port is defective or if the cartridge that we recently purchased is defective, and we have gotten tired of trying to have the problem corrected. It's a big disappointment to us."
1,"Crap, just crap","Bought this in September 2012. January 2013, the wire contacts worked loose and nearly started a fire when I plugged it in."
4,Cool for the price,"This wasn't too bad, it worked fine, like the original manufacturer one except one of the ends where it's glue is loose for some reason. Otherwise, good buy."
3,"Hot, high power usage",I use the laptop in a vehicle and run it off a power inverter that converts 12 volt DC to 115 AC. This adapter uses 50 watts of power. The original used less than 5. It also gets hotter than the original one did.
5,A Gift for the Heart,Buddhist Teacher David Loy argues persuasively that Buddhism needs the West and an infusion of its values and ideals. But it is equally important for Western Buddhists (in which group I count myself) to remember that we have great spiritual teachers in the East. This is a lovely reminder.
4,Rare find,I recommend Amongst white clouds. The movie was well made and the scenery was nice. There are Monks and a Nun practicing in the remote mountains of China. The interviews are short but do offer some teachings and you get a brief look at how and where they live. This is most likely not going to be seen at the local multi screen theater. If you liked the book Road to Heaven by Bill Porter you will Probably like this also.Its nice to know there is still a few places in today's modern world where people can still live and practice this way.
2,Provides lesson in Buddhism; not the one I was expecting,"After reading the documentary description and several rave reviews, I was anxious to watch this movie. It provides a lesson in Buddhism, but not the one I was expecting. I was expecting to hear or see actual translation of what the hermits were saying about the practice, yet there were very few lines translated. I got more wisdom from watching Kung Fu Panda with my son, than I got from this movie. To say I was dissapointed, is an understatement. I don' think I will ever watch this movie again. I purchased this film, in part, to share with friends and family who were not familiar with Buddhism. Even as an enthusiastic practitioner, I find little in this film to inspire me to want o know more about Buddhism, which is a shame. Don't waste your money, donate it to a charity like SAVA instead."
1,"Maybe there was good intention, but was so mixed up....","If you like to drink hot coffee mixed with iced tea, you will enjoy and value the movie. Even the cover is deceptive: forget about seeing any hermit caves on side of mountains, there is not even ONE."
1,Already debunked.,"This is a completely naive explanation of the Bible Code. Similar programs have been run on the works of Twain and War and Peace and yeilded similarily ""startling"" (if not more so) results. Don't waste a dollar on this trash - unless you need something to prop under a table leg..."
5,Wonderful,"This was the best Thoroughred book in a long time. I just couldn't put it down! The way Karen Bently described Sammy's feelings was perfect. I'd been waiting for a book of Sammy or Ashleigh. Thank you! I knew Tor and Sammy would get married soon. I can't wait! I just have one error check. You called Honor Bright Wonder's daghter, when she's really the daughter of Townsend Princess, Wonder's real daughter. By the way I want to learn more about Christina Reese. Keep them coming!"
1,I like this flavor but the bars were months past expiration,"This rating is for Amazon sending me bars that were months past their expiration date. I have had this flavor (Spiced Pumpkin Pie) of Clif Bars before and I like it. However the bars I received from Amazon were dry, and the icing was yellow from age. The other flavor I ordered, Cranberry Apple Cherry, was fresh and as good as getting it from a grocery store. But I wish quality control at Amazon would make it so they do not send expired food to customers."
2,Stale,"I eat a lot of Cliff bars, I enjoy them but these were stale. I found the expiration date was August 2005 but I ordered these in October 2005. I called customer service and they said I need to ship these back so I could get a refund ... not worth the 10 bucks. With the price increase I can get these cheaper at my local store a safer bet."
1,condesending and all wheat free?,worst cook book i own. all the recipes have odd ingredients and she uses no wheat in any of the recipes? that means no seitan...which is amazing and i dont see how anyone could have anything against it. she should have written that on the back so i could have saved my money on this time waster. not to mention how she aims to make readers feel like idiots for not kissing the ground she walks on.
5,my husband LOVES it!,"Santa brought my husband this fantastic skillet. Since then he has used it on a regular basis. ""There is nothing as good as bacon made in this skillet"" he raved. He is right of course. Anything prepared in it tastes fabulous. A gift that will last a lifetime (and beyond)."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the ""sweater"" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious ""Z"" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase."
4,4.5....good hip-hop entertainment...,"here's the deal...for those buying it strictly for the Rhymefest-Eminem-Juice battle...you wont be disappointed..except for the fact that the audio transfer from VHS to DVD is not all that great, in some instances you can hardly hear the MC flowing, Juice straight murders Eminem in the Pre-Lims and the final..Eminem comes out strong too, dont get it twisted, Dose one and Rhymefest rip it too...now the rest are 97-99 scribble jam videos with the mandatory Graff Flix, MC-DJ-BBOY Battles...something new to some, nothing different to many..good purchase overall...just waiting for vol.1 to come in the mail..peace to all."
5,Intriging stories.,Great series. Love the subtlety of the British and the clever way he solves the crimes. Liked his driver a lot
4,"Loved It, But It Is the Last","The war ends and with it this series which is one of my favorites. Strongly suggest watching the at least the first series, before watching this one, because otherwise you won't appreciate some of the relevations.Besides, the entire series is great, so why jump ahead to the end?"
4,I passed the exam....barely,"I have to give this book a high rating because I did pass using only this book... I got a 420 which is the ace recommened score. Also, I only studied about a week before I had to take the test. I'm not great at science, so I figured what the heck. If I don't pass, I'll just take some dantes tests. Fortunately, it worked out. If a high score is imporant, I would also buy the Princeton Review book also(It also might help to study more than a week) Princeton Review tells you EXACTLY what you need to study for.Good Luck!"
2,Not Quite Good Enough,"I agree with other reviewers. I took the test, using this book alone, and missed passing by 1 point. There were several items not covered in the book that were on the test."
3,Not an Easy Way Out,"This book is designed to assist students in refreshing their memories about science. It gives good test taking tips, and it gave me an idea as to which other books I needed to read. I ended up checking out more books from the library including: biology, chemistry, and geology. My science knowledge was not that strong when I started studying for the test, but I passed the test after studying the subject for 3 months. In short, this book is NOT a quick fix to passing the science clep. I gave it 3 stars because it did point me in the right direction. Good Luck!"
1,"VERY outdated material, save your money and don't buy!","Though the publishing date listed is 2005, be warned that this is just a reprint of a 1978 book, not an update of a 1978 book. As such, it is very outdated; for instance, it still lists the solar system as having 9 planets, the purpose of the thymus as 'unknown', etc. If you were to memorize all the outdated material in this book, it would make it very difficult to actually pass the CLEP NatSci exam."
1,A Disappointing Prep Book,"It is a very concise preparation book for the Natural Sciences CLEP exam which only hinges on a few topics for each subject area (physics, chemistry etc.) It is certain that the examinee will need other resources (college textbooks or study guides) for an optimum and effective preparation. That said, the review does not offer sample of tests akin to the difficulty of the actual one. The questions in the review are in majority conceptual, which is not the case for the real exam. Eventually, there is NO progression throughout the book; which makes it difficult for the examinee to evaluate whether s/he is ready to take the test. Overall because of the lack of concistency and reflection to the real exam, I will highly recomment not to buy this book on its own as a preparation guide."
3,"lots of information, lots of errors","The book addresses letter and word play in such breadth as to command authority. The frequency of errors in its examples and tables, however, gives an opposite impression. I soon found myself playing a different game than any described in the text: looking for errors. (For example, a lipogram supposedly lacking the letter H contains the word ""the""; another supposedly lacking the letter A contains the word ""day"" (p. 4). At least 3 of 100 purported palindromes on pp. 32-4 are not quite: ""Tense I 'snap' Sharon's roses, or Norah's pansies net""; ""Evil is the name of a foeman as I live""; ""Stephen, my lad--ah, what a hymn, eh, pets?"") I found 11 in the first 50 pages, and I would not be surprised if I missed some. Then I quit: it was less challenging than most of the play described in the book."
4,Some greats/some dogs,"Every CD like this always has a few ""who are these guys?"" Unfortunately this one has no secret gems by unknown bands. The greats are great and thankfully with a CD one can hit ""Next"" and skip the trash."
3,"Great singing, but","I am a huge admirer of Domingo's. With this month's release of Parsifal, Edgar, and these songs, he moves into an area little short of miraculous: at 65, the voice is still magnificent, and what he can do with it...!These are all good, simple songs, sung very well. Note the 40th wedding anniversary present to his father and mother by Placido Junior! Really, it's Caruso territory, and Domingo need fear no comparison vocally or musically. But one advantage Caruso (and Gigli) did have: arrangements that remembered that these are simple songs. The arrangers here have yet again over-blown the orchestration in the best (or worst) Hollywood style, and the effect is simply that of too much sugar (and too many cymbals).Domingo, who emerges with honor regardless of such schlock, deserves better. He is a treasure.If you can filter out the thousand-and-one strings effect - get this."
3,He waited too long,"Unfortunately he waited too long to record these songs. If only he had sung these when he was in his youthful prime. Only compare his recording of ""Non t'amo piu"" to that of Pavarotti and you will realize the difference between good and great. He seems to be pushing throughout, and this effortfulness limits his ability to interpret these songs. I almost wish he had transposed these songs down a Major Second or minor Third, so that he could sing them with more ease. But being Domingo it is not a bad cd; it is only not as good as it could have been.I can only hope that Juan Diego Flores does not make the same mistake."
3,"Not exactly what I'd hoped for, but very useful.","Basically, this cord gets an attached flash from behind the lens to greatly reduce glare and increase the shading of the subject. Doing so provides greater visual relief by casting subtle shadows. What it does not do, however, is allow one to use commander mode for multiple wireless flashes unless the attached flash also has a commander mode built in already, i.e. SB-900. I do not understand why Nikon does not provide better descriptions of it's attachments by promoting the benefits instead of a list of technical features. It's as if a clock were described as ""an analog display consisting of multiple needle pointers that rotate in a ratio of 60 to 1 so that the angle of the pointers relative to the vertical axis indicates the precise number of cycles of an internal driving device that is synchronized with the rotation of the earth."""
3,Confusing for a novice camera person,"Confusing product with very poor instructions. Plus once you tether your flash the flash on the camera becomes disabled which I thought was weird. Also, you need a sceond tri-pod for your tethered flash."
5,"Pedantic, yes, but still an excellent reference","The title itself is more than just a little self-righteously pedantic, and the language used within often reflects the title. However, the contents are an excellent reference tool for anyone interested in sparking up their writing.Cliché's, misplaced metaphors, and other identifications made by Fiske occur too often in published books. I personally use this (along with its relative companion, The Dictionary of Concise Writing) with regularity, and have caught myself more than once using language that could use some freshening up."
2,Felt Like a Dimwit for ordering,This selection was not nearly as entertaining or helpful as I suspected it would be from the reviews I read prior to purchasing. Was quite disappointed with the content.
1,Disseminates Mean-Spirited and Destructive Convictions,"Fiske has written a strange book indeed. Its primary purpose would appear to be the dissemination of an idea that with Fiske somehow dim-wittedness can be removed from your language. Alas, his identification of so-called grammatical gimmicks, ineffectual phrases, moribund metaphors, wretched redundancies, and the like is seldom shared by well-known language critics such as R.W. Burchfield, Bryan A. Garner, and William Safire.That said, he does tend to identify weak and rummy phrases. However, instead of suggesting ways of strengthening such phrases to unassailable idiomatic expressions, Fiske suggests their deletion or single word replacements, which tend to be as queer and eccentric as they are gestures of ill-will and contempt for English idiom and its guardians."
5,vocal Iraqi maqam,"The art of Iraqi maqam reached its ultimate refinement during the golden age of the Abbasid dynasty in Baghdad, a key city on the borders of the Arab, Turkish and Persian worlds. Used by classical and popular musicians, it was not only favored by the local aristocracy in their music rooms, but also used at religious celebrations and Sufi ceremonies. Unusually, it is sung here by a woman accompanied an ensemble playing santur, a hammer dulcimer, and the four-stringed djoza.-- review from CDroots"
1,Received Cutler Hammer type CH labeled THQL21100,Buyer Beware!! I received Cutler Hammer type CH labeled THQL21100. I'm posting a picture so you can judge for yourself.
2,Stopped Working Within 3 Months,Pros - While it worked it worked wellCons - It worked for only three months
5,A Unique Resource,"This is one of the very few books on men's mysteries that I can actually recommend to my friends and family. Firethorn has been immersed in the topic for over twenty years and has taken many young men and their older brothers into the depths of their souls. The exercises he presents in this book are excellent (if sometimes weird) and his insights are deep and meaningful. He presents the male soul out in the daylight, warts and all, and finds it valuable and worthy. This isn't just another fluffy ""Iron John"" spin-off, but a work of both intellect and heart that I found highly inspirational while writing my own book ""The Pagan Man."" Whether you are a teenaged male or a fully grown man (or a woman who loves one), this book will be a guiding voice while you're out there on that tightrope."
1,"""Fried Pies"" by Jane Seymour","This book is read often by my twin granddaughters. They enjoy reading and playing school, and havean assotrment of children's books."
5,This one requires patience!,"If you're a FNM or Mr. Bungle fan you will not necessarily like this album. It's hard to think of anything to compare it to. Even Patton's Bungle stuff is very different. It bears some similarity to the last Tool album, so if you like moodiness you might be better served by checking out that album. This one takes a lot more time to get into. I do think this one is much better than The Director's Cut, but I didn't like that album very much anyway. It sounds a lot like some of the more experimental jazz albums in my collection. There is a great album by Keith Jarrett called ""The Survivor's Suite,"" which is very similar in overall mood to this one. Ornette Coleman's ""Skies of America,"" and his ""Song X"" also come to mind."
3,Beautiful job with the colored vinyl!,"This is the best colored LP I've ever seen! It's black with all these detailed lines and numbers, like a giant circular protractor or something. The music is kinda interesting...background stuff, the more outre Patton is on show here, the one with both hands cupping the mic like a 3 year-old, making weird sound with it. Not the go-ahead rock guy at all. But the colored vinyl is the reason to get this...available for $30 on record store day. Anything more is madness."
4,frightening...,"This album basically sounds like a journey to hell, or through a horror film or whatever... but yet, it isn't quite as simple as that.Do not buy this expecting 'real music' with vocals and song structure ect. ect.. This is just one long track, but it is way more than a 'bunch of noises' and yes, more than just 'ambience'. This is a beautifully haunting soundscape and work of art in my opinion, but thats the point of this album. Opinions. Some will love this and call it a piece of art, and others will hate it and call it a piece of garbage. It is completely according to your own personal definition of music. I cannot reccomend this album, because even though it works for me, I cannot say with conviction that it will work for you. If you are open minded, and looking for something unusual and original, look no further.. on the other hand if you are looking for 'music', then walk on by."
4,Intriguing and unique.,"Mike Patton and company have produced something rather bizarre this time around-- its not for everyone-- if you prefer Patton's more straight stuff to his more avant-garde, then don't waste your time with this one.The album feels like a soundtrack, given Patton's penchant for this, this should not be a surprise-- the music builds in waves, quiet atmospheric periods followed by moments of tension and aggression. Musically, its almost operatic in nature. The vocals are wordless, more assisting in atmosphere than in attempting to communicate anything. But the thing to note about this-- in its over 74 minutes, this piece DOES evoke moods, haunting, anticipation, and does so quite well. This is, in many ways, a major success. Its definitely not easy to swallow, but it can be very rewarding."
4,I read a lot of bad reviews on this work.,"I think the main reason people don't like this album, is the fact that they don't get it. I think it's supposed to be a atmospheric cd and in that light, it does wonderfully. It's kinda of like listening to a horror movie, only, instead of watching it, your mind serves as the picture. And it's very frightening. This album is, obviously, something that has never been done before. It's kinda like those ""Rain-Forest"" relaxation cds you could've bought at any drug-store 10-15 years ago. This is the type of work that would make David Lynch proud. I love ""Eraserhead"", but no one can EVER get a plot out of it. I think this is Patton's attempt at acheiving this in an audio format. It's suspenseful, mysterious and unpredictable. It's a true piece of art. ART is the keyword."
2,boring,"This is the worst Fantomas album. There are a few good parts, but the album as a whole just drags on too long and there are a lot of boring and pointless parts.Their best albums are Suspended Animation and Director's Cut"
2,Just not that interesting,"I listen to all kinds of music that other people find annoying or disturbing, and this album certainly fits that description. Unfortunately, it's just not that compelling to me. Most of the ""found"" material sounds contrived and corny -- more like the haunted house at the amusement park than the chilling journey that I think Patton probably intended it to be.I appreciate the stretch, but it's a failed attempt as far as I'm concerned."
2,Come on- let's get real for a second....,"As cool as the cd case/cover and artwork is and as cool as the concept is... this cd is useless. There's some cool parts and it sets atmoshpere well- but just admit you've shelfed this and are not going to listen to it much ever again. For those of you that will ACTUALLY listen to this MANY more times like a regular cd... god bless yah. I'm down for getting more enjoyment out of stuff in life. They better get back to ""Director's Cut"" form."
2,I guess i'm not as diehard as the rest of you fans...,"This album is, dare I say it (?)... annoying and boring. It brings me back to the day i bought the solo Patton album 'Adult Themes for Voice'. I tried to take the cd back and Barnes and Noble wouldn't let me because i'd opened the cd. I love Mike Patton, but this album is the second he's made me feel like hi wonderful sense of goofiness and irony is focused soley on me, the listener. Granted, there are moments of creepiness i can appreciate as a work of art, but i really haven't bought an album by Patton yet as a work of abstract art. I love the brilliance polished with an almost pop sensibility. That characteristic that made Mr. Bungle's 'California' my favorite album of all time. To me, this album is just another time-killer until we get another 'Director's Cut' or 'Angel Dust' or the underappreciated 'MIT GAS'. Up the bar, Mike!"
2,Boring album,"I change my mind and go back to my 2 star review. I am disappointed and think all the members of this band including Mike don't have enough faith in the power Fantomas can have. People are sick of new metal and I know lots of people, including myself, that are sick of Slayer and their worn out ideas. Directors Cut was totally fresh and original. Delerium Cordia is not acceptable to me as a huge fan of either Mike Patton or Dave Lombardo. I expect way better on the follow up guys. This release is just boring."
4,Takes a few listens - then the album starts to take hold,"The first time I listened to this album, I'll be honest, I didn't like it much. Then I listened again, and it was okay, I could start to see how it made sense... A friend of mine came over and he was dying to hear it so I played it yet again and now, it's actually finding it's way inside my psyche... Now, I find myself enjoying the ablum, enjoying the single track, and enjoying the unpredictability of getting to know FANTOMAS!"
2,Third time's a charm!,"All respect to the previous greatness Mike has been involved with, but...If I wanted to listen to a soundtrack I'd watch a movie while doing such.If I wanted to listen to slow progressive metal I'd put in Opeth.I would not, however, continue listen to something, and furthermore rave about how great it is, just because I liked the previous work of that artist.There is NO WAY these people would be raving about this album if done anonymously. And you know it."
1,where is the movie,"There is no music on this CD. It is quite literally sound effects interlaced with temperory fits of ""suspense"" building noise just like that you would expect to hear on a dodgy 1970's b-grade horror movie.In fact it could be quite a good package if there was a dodgy 1970's b-grade horror movie included.Don't get me wrong im all for experimentation but seriously this a complete waste of 74 minutes of your life."
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"Fantomas is a very strange band. Their first albums was an intense and insane collection of short, nameless songs. Their second was a collection of dark covers, and their third is one giant creepfest. Any fan of Melvins/Patton/Ipecac work knows that occasionally they release what I call ""Duds"". There has to be someone who likes this stuff (see other reviews)but I always feel BURNED when I pick up a CD like this. It is over an hour of creepy noise and... more noise. If you want some MUSIC, buy some MR.Bungle, Estradasphere, Secret Cheifs, or (Certain)Melvins."
3,Patton tricked them,"Like bottled water, Mike Patton has tricked many fans into proclaiming a mediocre soundtrack to be ""brilliant"" and ""genius"".....ITS A SOUNDTRACK.Its packaged like a CD, but its a soundtrack. Thats not brilliant its just misclassified. If I put gravy on a hot dog thats not brilliant, its just shuffling items around (that sounds pretty good...).Personally, this has provided me with below average stimulation. I'm just going to leave it at that unqualified statement, because there's little to say other than that this sounds like a cool soundtrack for a creepy movie. Its kinda of like an extended drawn out single off of director's cut (which is an infinitely better disc)."
1,Even if im Probably the Biggest Fan of Mike....,"Even if im Probably the Biggest Fan of Mike....that cd is just for your Collection! U cant listen to it. And if u do, theres no chance u re gonna put it on u r cd player again or at least for more than 2-3 times (in ur whole life:) LOLAnyway if u re a fan of Fantomas and MIkE Go for it!"
3,"good, but not as mindblowing as i was expecting","Fantomas's first album blew me away - it's still probably in my top ten albums ever. The follow up, Director's Cut, I liked but didn't love. After hearing that this new album was going to be one track, and hearing the sample that was floating around the internet, I was really looking forward to this one, thinking it'd be similar to Don Salsa.I was right - it was similar, but unfortunately nowhere near as good. The main problem I have with Delirium Cordia is the excessive amount of silence. Don't get me wrong, atmospheric sounds are great, just I feel it's used way too much. When it does get going, it's fantastic - its just too few and far between for my personal taste.Patton and Buzzo don't always get it right, but they do try something new each time, and I really admire that."
2,"Where have you gone?? Buzzo, speak to me??","Well,What can I say? So much talent; So many ideas; So much of it not used on this album. Sorry guys, if I wanted to hear boring ambient sounds I'd pick up a cheesy Solitudes CD or something off James Plotkin's empty room. On top of that, everything is recorded to one bloody track. Try fast forwarding to your favorite part; it's fun.For those of you new to the Fantomas, don't pick up this album.Go out and get the brilliant ""Amenaza al Mundo "" or the awesome ""Director's Cut"". Don't get me wrong, there are those that appreciate ""atmospheric experimetal"" stuff but I just get bored. Once you've heard John Zorn's work, you've heard it all. I'll skip this 74min ""sound check"" for the next album."
2,Patton what happened?,Let me start by saying I am a HUGE HUGE Mike Patton fan and love all his work to date except this. The first two Fantomas records were very unique and ingenious. This is just artsy ambient shlock! With a man so great as Patton I would expect more. I have tried listening to this numerous times and I am sorry it does not make the cut.
5,Very Useful Resource!,"I took a Photonics course with Professor Quimby when he was in the process of writing this book, and I studied several textbooks on the subject during the course. His book was the most useful, it made the rather complicated subject of Photonics more comprehensible than any other text. Great chapter on the several different types of photo detectors and lasers, also great introduction to fiber optic communications!"
1,They look great in the stock photo but not in real life,"I bought these plates and also the white larger dinner plates and I was so disappointed in the quality. Right out of the factory sealed package 10 out of the 12 plates I ordered were scratched or had defeats. Plus they were packed very poorly by the company and about 7 out of the 12 were either chipped or damaged. These plates are very very poor quality and I would recommend NOT BUYING THESE PLATES. I have never been so disappointed in a purchase quite like this. I received a refund within 48 hours and if I could give it a zero star, I would. Don't waste your time or money... go with something else."
4,Female Lawyer Discovers Family Secrets,"Hannah Dain's mother died during childbirth. Her older sister Shelby, also a lawyer, had always been antagonistic towards her. As Shelby was to say, ""if you hadn't been born she (mother) wouldn't be dead."" No matter what she did Hannah could never please her father Richard, also a lawyer and head of the firm Dain & Dain. Why no Dain,Dain & Dain? With a fair amount of excitement, crime, ethical issues,shady real estate transactions, financial skullduggery and murders the dark truth eventually comes out. The action takes place in Pinnacle Peak, a small resort town in Arizona. And by the way, there's a splash of romance too. The length of the book was just right, 240 pages. A good fast moving plot and read."
4,"Great, I Was There","Well, I was at the Concert at Nov 5th 2002, when Paul recorded ""Hey Jude"" that it's in this CD, the sound is great and it captures all the magic that an amazing tour can be. The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't have any dialog between Paul and People, but it sounds great anyway."
4,"Good product, but still need to add air occasionally","Good fit to wheel, sturdy tube, no installation issues, but still need to add air occasionally, like conventional non-slime tubes."
5,Excellent,Kept having a tire go flat on my cart with these tubes that doesn't happen..no more flat tires everagain
1,Not like picture,"The picture shows 4 balls and the description says ""balls"" (plural). However, only 1 comes in the package! Not worth $5."
1,Disappointed!!!,"The picture shows it on the boys head, and it doesn't even fit on my kids hand!! They wanted it for their head. I am very disappointed!"
1,Don't waste your time,"With its marked absence of insight and indulgence in superficial little theories of human psyche, this one is a rare waste of paper on which it was printed. It wouldn't be too bad if it were a high school essay, but that's where its depth stops. Interesting at times, but mostly boring."
4,"Small-City America, the Beautiful","""Basketball-bellied men in their fifties heaved themselves out of the low seats of the cars at midnight and went into the doughnut shops carrying police-band radios and wearing camouflage jackets and multicolored baseball caps."" What sets Alan Sternberg's stories apart is his ability to capture the physical and emotional sense of what it means to be in the working class today. Written in the early '90s in Connecticut, his collection of short stories remains one of the finest examinations of small-city American culture."
3,The hardest game so far,"Like the other Xavix games, this is truly interactive. There is NO WAY to cheat on this. Pitching is a lot easier than batting. I can throw strikes like a pro but my hitting leaves a lot to be desired. In the beginning I thought (hoped) maybe my unit was not really working but when I tried selecting with the bat and doing some training it was quite obvious that the system was reading the sensors just fine. You really have to work on getting the timing just right."
2,Gorgeous Gift,"I received this at my baby shower from my best friend & future godmother. I loved it!!! It truly is a beautiful bassinet. The toile print on the bedding is just remarkable & it brings out the black, but still looks soft enough for a baby. This was my favorite gift at my shower!"
1,UNSAFE!!!,"One of these bassinets was purchased for my 8lb son and collapsed. By the grace of God, he was removed shortly before this happened. The bracing beneath it snapped so there is no way to repair it. I will NEVER purchase another item from them. EXTREMELY UNSAFE!!!"
3,Looks Nice,"My husband is a mechanic, so he usually does all the handiwork in our house, but I put this one together myself with very few problems. Some of the pre-drilled holes were not completely drilled and some were not straight, so I had to have my husband tighten up some of my screws. Forget the shelf on the bottom, ours was cut SO poorly that it didn't ever stay put, so we removed it. The bassinet looks beautiful in our bedroom, and I am pleased with the purchase, but I bought it when it was significantly cheaper--I am not sure I would pay full price for it myself."
4,The best of Lovelace is worth your time.,Patty Lovelace is authentic bluegrass and country in a great package. This brings many of her best moments to one CD. Well done.
3,"great, but...","This is lovely for fit, prettiness, and utility, but...I ordered it in black and with washing (per instructions) it turned the beautiful lace an ugly color that bothers me as I so want to enjoy this otherwise nicely designed gown. It is so comfortable that I can wear it at home like a day dress."
4,Very sturdy figures,Bought this along w/ a number of other Spider Man figures for my young nephew (9) & he loved them. They appear to be built to last. I am happy w/ the purchase. They were less expensive than in my local toy store & more variety was available here as well.
3,"Not Lindskold's best, but may be worth the time...","I, too, felt the need to slog through this dense novel instead of enjoy it. I didn't skip the parts with Derian and other characters - as another reviewer said here. Plik is a true delight! And Derian, well, you'll have to read the book. He and his struggles may be worth the price of admission, alone. I've read all the other Firekeeper books and I will read Wolf Blood, but perhaps not immediately. This book did seem to meander, as a book with an unknown quest, to an unknown place to find unknown people, with some unreliable information givers as sources might. But the whole thing left me a bit unsettled, unsure of what happened, a bit frustrated, when I finished the book."
5,Wolf fantasy adventure,"Wolf Hunting and the whole series of 6 books was one of my very favorite fantasy books of all time. The author is an excellent writer and has a great imagination. If you love wolves and other animals, magic, intrigue, and adventure, you can't help but love this series."
4,Wolf Series,"In gerneral, I love this series but am somewhat uncomfortable with the direction she's heading with the development of the heroine."
5,Perfect Music for Kids,I've been looking for some classic Christian children's music to share with our granddaughter. She loves it and asks to listen to it every time we get in the car. Every grandparent should purchase this for their g'children. The music is great and the message is forever appropriate.
5,Probably GREAT!!!,"I've the record, yes record, ""Canonazos 1 Y Canonazos 2, and it's absolutely wonderful. If anyone knows where or how I can get a CD I'd sure appreciate knowing. It's what I'm looking for and the music on it is a best ""happy music"" I've ever heard. PS: 5 stars is only half enough. Listen and you'll agree."
5,Great Dutch oven,"Great oven, I have used it a couple times and love it. The pre-seasoning was fine. Must confess though I use the liners on my scouting trips so clean up was a breeze. Bought scout version because I want to pass it down to my son."
5,Just pick this one up,"Just pick this one up for my son he is boy scouts.He can take it to BSA summer camp and show it offand show the other boy how to cook it and he know how to cook!!I have 5 camp dutch oven my self all are LODGE4qt,5qt,2-6qt,& 8qt and we love to cook in all of them.THANKS LODGEFYI(basspro shop is the only one that have the 5qt 10""dia 5""Deep(L10DC03) if you are looking for one)"
4,"Excellent, humorous introduction to Hawking & modern physics","After picking this up in a bookstore in Chicago, I couldn't stop reading it after I had started. The book combines interviews with Hawking along with biographical information and excellent cartoon illustrations and black & white photos to explain how modern thoughts on physics and black holes were developed. I've used some of the information from this book to teach my high school Physics class about black holes, and I hope to use it more in the future. The book sort of ends without much explanation of the COBE background explorer, but other than that, it's full of essential information presented in a format that is easy and fun to read."
4,"Sabrina Goes to Rome the book, is much better than the movie","Sabrina thinks she'll be living in royalty with everything to herself during her visit to Rome. The problem: she thought wrong! During her trip Sab stays in a very nice room...with another teenage witch! Sabrina and her new witch friend, Gwen, explore the streets of Rome together along with some unexpected visitors... What could go wrong while browsing a few museums, looking for the answer to her family secret? Don't ask..."
2,Pretty average really,"Elton's style in this one just falls short of being enjoyable to read. It drags. The book just doesn't go anywhere for the first half and although it starts to pick up in the second half and even develops suspense towards the end, once you've finished you probably will not spend time really thinking about the issues he has tried to riase. Because we've probably thought about it all before and there's nothing new in here. Bit of a tedious read."
3,Missing Something,"I have read and enjoyed all of Ben Eltons work. This book broadcasts his same humor, but I felt it was missing something. The manner in which the whole book unfolds during one night in London is well done, and I found the ending exciting, and well written. But this book lost something in the middle, it became a touch boring, and the jokes had been used to many times before.With all that said however, I feel that Ben Elton remains the master of comedy writing, his books, TV shows and Stand Up routines are a cut above everybody else."
3,Not as good as previous Ben Elton books,"A long time Ben Elton fan, I was keenly looking forward to his latest work. I was a little dissapointed. While an easy read, the book certainly was not as funny as previous works. The main characters started off well but by the end they were nothing if not annoying, both as inflexible as each other. The nasty subplot of the stalker tried to treat a very serious matter somewhat lighheartedly.The ending became predictable although the advertised 'twist' was a nice touch. Ben Elton seems to be ending his more recent books with a note of hope unlike the bleak endings of Stark and Gridlock.Overall a reasonble novel, certainly not as good as previous novels and probably only for fans."
1,Was Ben Elton ever really that funny?,"This book is terrible. Obviously the story is just a flimsy excuse for Ben Elton to wax lyrical about all sorts of tired political themes. I read it primarily because I was aware that sometime in the (distant) past, Ben Elton was actually a funny man and I wanted a laugh. Unfortunately the story which he chooses to frame his views is just awful, why the pretence of a thriller? It's very inept, sub Sidney Sheldon stuff. None of the characters strike me as remotely believable, they are all just slaves to the plot and the (pointless) diatribes they utter. Absolutely pointless book, money for old rope."
4,A fun Ben book,"I have been a huge Ben Elton fan for years (unusual for a yank for sure, however lived in Australia for 8 years, so...), and have read all his books. I felt that this had it's truly enjoyable Elton comic moments, however the story was rather weak. Buy, hey, what the hell! Ben's books have never been literary masterpieces nor the top of the pops when it comes to 'the most clever plot line' either. Stark was better than this, however this was a far cry better than the pathetic 'Other Eden' thing he did a few years back. Overall, this book moves along pretty well, and sprinkles some of the ole Elton humour liberally amongst the situations. Can Ben really write the thriller of the year? NO - however this book is great bit of fun, and we all need that every so often, eh?Enjoy it for what it is - Ben is not out to be the next Hemingway or anything - I think he just likes to write, and he doesn't do a bad job of it at all."
4,Extreme G.I. Joe meets Left Wing Bridget Jones,"I think Ben Elton has a lovely sick sense of humor that I can't help but respect. Some people have complained that the characters in this book are too stereotypical but I think that is what makes this book so funny. But I will admit that this book is not as good as ""Popcorn"" but it is still a very funny book."
3,Good stuff (usually),"I've been eating Clif Bars for years now. The white chocolate macadamia nut bars are the best! I've ordered these bars in bulk from Amazon in the past (for the good deal). Unfortunately, there's something off with the latest batch I received via Amazon (two cases of 12 bars; batch Feb 2012 01). I tried bars from both boxes and not only is the taste off, but I felt nauseous after eating them.I reported this to the manufacturer. They acknowledged ""taste variations"" and offered to send replacements. HOWEVER, the rep. was reluctant to send more of the same type of bar for fear that I'd receive an identical batch. The rep. offered to send samples of another type of bar, but unfortunately I've yet to see them in the three weeks since the call.In the end, while I like this product, I'll be waiting a while before I order any more. If the folks at Clif Bar don't make good on a replacement or reimbursement, I'll probably never order again."
5,Clif Bars to the rescue!!,"Clif bars are my post workout food. They have everything I look for in a food. They are Vegan, #1 and they are often all organic. They have a good amount of calories and fat considering the quality of the ingredients. I don't mind a little higher calories or fat when it is something healthy and good for me. Best of all there is a nice amount of fiber and plenty of protein. My favorite flavors are Crunchy Peanut Butter & Chocolate Brownie. The only flavor I do not care for is Chocolate Chip...too sweet. I tell everyone about the bars and everyone comes back happy I told them. So thanks Clif!!!"
3,Black Cherry Almond Clif Bar,"It should be called, Almond Black Cherry. The almond flavor seems a little too overpowering for me. The black cherry taste is great, just a little too much almond flavor for my liking.You can't go wrong with Clif Bars though either way. This just isn't my favorite."
2,Doesn't taste anything like chocolate!,"It doesn't taste anything like chocolate! It tastes like a boring apple-cinnamon flavored granola bar with a little bit of white icing drizzled on top!I also bought the Clif mini bars and I loved all of them, including Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Brownie which DO taste like chocolate!(The peanut butter flavor is awesome)"
1,Didn't work.,This would not charge my IPOD. I had to buy an additional charger and plug it into the wall outlet to charge.
5,iPod sync and charge cable,"This cable is very well made, complete with push-button locks to secure it to the iPod. The extra length is something that is a real plus for me, since I can more easily reach the AC to USB charger I have plugged into my electrical outlet.This cable worked out so well for me that I placed a return order for a second cable.This is not a genuine Apple cable, but in my opinion it is better than what Apple supplies with the iPod."
1,Do Not Bother!,"I should have payed attention to the other 1 star ratings. I would send it back if I could. This thing is absolutely worthless. Not only will it not charge my ipad, it will not sync either. I tried time and time again to get it to sync with itunes. Everytime it would either not sync or it would lock up itunes and my whole pc, forcing me to reboot each time."
2,Nice... but... watch what case you are using.,"Using this on an iphone 3Gs. Overall I am very happy with the quality, length, and price of the cable but there is one thing that is a major deal breaker. The cable will not fit when I have my Otterbox case on. The factory Apple cable plugs in but this cable is too bulky to fit with the case in place. If they could shrink the bulk of the connector down to fit with the case on, I would give it a 5 star rating. As it is, it is totally unusable."
1,Junk.,"I'm sure most people looking at this item are like me: wanting to find a cheaper route than buying a new $30 apple cable. Apple fanboy, I aint. As it happens, I wish I had just bought the real thing right away, so I wouldn't be messing with this piece of junk.First off, this does not work for charging at all. ""No problem,"" I thought. ""I'll just use it exclusively for syncing."" Well, it turns out that while your device is syncing with this cable - instead of getting fed some low voltage USB juice - it drains the device completely.So, if you want a cable that will sync your device but you must watch over it lest the device go dead, then this is for you!But I recommend buying the original apple cable and do it right the first time."
5,Sync Cabe for ipod (Made by Cables To Go),I read lots of reviews for a sync cable. I came across this one and decided to take the plunge. Why? Because the company Cables-To-Go is 40 minutes from my house and knew of the reputation of quality products they sell. Don't hesitate to buy this product. It works well. I get a secure connection and does what it is suppose to do. Sync!
3,"Compatible with 3g Nano, but not fully with 3g Touch","This cable syncs and charges the 3g Nano. However, it only charges the 3g Touch."
5,As good as what came with the ipod originally,"The dog chewed the end off our cable so we needed a replacement. I couldn't see shelling out $20+ for an apple brand, so I checked amazon and found this one.What more can I say about this cable than it does what it is supposed to do. It plugged in fine. It syncs our ipods. You can buy 4 of these for the price of an official one. In this economy, every penny saved is another item you can afford to buy."
2,iPhone/iPod Touch users beware,"iPhone and iPod Touch users should be very careful with this product. It's not a full replacement for the Apple cable - in particular, it will not charge reliably. Instead, you end up with the device going off and on charge mode repeatedly."
5,Very Nice,The cable works perfectly and the price is right.Now I have a cable for my car and one for the house.I bought a usb adapter for my cigar lighter and it enables me to charge my ipod when its in my vehicle.I can play it through my vehicle's car stereo while it is still plugged in.No chance for my ipod's battery going dead.Thank you.
5,Works great with iPhone 3G,"There's not much to say except that this is an inexpensive, high quality product, and is a lot sturdier and thicker than the cable that Apple provides you. This is exactly what I needed, a stronger and longer cord to charge my iPhone/iPod. This cable is also great if your electric outlet is far from your bed and you use your iPhone as your alarm clock."
5,An unforgettable epic,Kristin's story is universal and timeless. This incredibly rich saga is relevant to twentieth century society and touches on so many of the life experiences we all go through. I read this book when I was sixteen and never forgot it- my oldest daughter is named Kristin.
3,Timeless 'saga',"I discovered this book while looking for Norway-related fiction--in preparation for a summer trip there. Although I found the language a bit difficult, I enjoyed the book and found it strangely restful. I cannot say why, but I got an overall sense of peace reading several sections of the book. I understand there may be more 'modern' translations and perhaps that would work better for me. This story of a young couple who are determined to marry despite many objections, does seem timeless and relevant. And, the historical notes are well done and help give a sense of life in Norway during the 13-1400's? (I believe that is the correct timeframe.) If you are interested in a good 'story', with what appears to be a sound historical perspective, try this one."
4,"A wonderful, beautiful classic....","I've just finished this and am so very grateful that an old friend recently recommended it. I had never before heard of Kristin Lavransdatter, or author Sigrid Undset, but am delighted to be into this story. I found the translation charming and not cumbersome for the most part. The dialogue is beautiful, and one truly feels in the hearts of these characters. I very much look forward to the second volume and will look up other books by Sigrid Undset. Finding new avenues to pursue in reading in historical fiction always brings me great happiness, and I hope others will see this review and decide to give this a try. You won't be disappointed!"
5,A wonderful insight into life in Norway in the middle ages,"As the trilogy has come so highly recommended by so many whose opinions I respect, I finally got around to reading the first volume and I found it unputtdownable. This tale of a young maiden coming of age, who is first bethrothed and is then seduced by a man she passionately falls for is beautifully told - one smells and breathes in the landscape and the times. And the rich backdrop of catholic norway with its saints and feast days makes one long again for a europe united under catholicism."
2,Not what I expected,"The Poster was not what I had expected, it was rather small. However I would make sure the next time that I read closer and see the actual size before I buy."
5,What a great find! Ecstatic!,"Baby loves it! We love it as a sub for morning cereal. It is simple as can be!No sugar added!I still have to research about the puff process...but so far we love the product and also their rice, corn and millet puffs! I put millet puffs on anything and baby will it it :))"
4,Yummy,If you like puffed wheat I think you will like Kamut maybe even a little more! I like to mix some into my yogurt for a more filling breakfast or snack than yogurt alone.
5,Just like Honey Smacks,"Great with some agave nectar drizzled on top, tastes just like Honey Smacks!! Wouldn't be able to tell a difference."
2,delicate,I wish they would make these action figures more durable but it seems that all the Incredibles toys in the series are very delicate and difficult to play with like kids do.
5,FROZONE from Incredibles,We received the item quickly and in excellent condition. This is a gift for my son's upcoming birthday. He will be thrilled. I'm thrilled to have found it.
3,The title should say it all...but does not !,"This book deals only with what is commonly known as "" GREEK AND RUSSIAN ICONS "" hence the title is VERY misleading ! And the description does not use these words either. Buying books , as I found out , basing yourself on a title and a summary description , as via Internet/Amazone , is a very risky business . I have no interest in russian icons but real interest in ICONOGRAPHY in general . I refer to "" Hall's Iconographic Manual : Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art ""Hence the WRONG BOOK...or the WRONG TITLE !"
2,Small pictures and odd choice of quotes,"I am wondering if many reviews on this book are done by sellers because I was not that impressed with this book. The book is small in size, I should have checked the dimensions. I thought the photos would be coffee-table book in size (huge, in other words). Plus, not just quotes but a lot of writing which I did not care for. And the quotes were from people I did not all deem quite respectable people (or even from persons whom one does not associate with religious but usually the opposite).I was going to give this as a gift but now I hesitate and will not buy the book again (as I had planned to, to give to someone else). There are several other books out there that connect faith and science."
3,"Maybe, but only if you are right-eared","The manufacturer's web site and the packaging on early-shipped models (such as the one I received) state it can be worn on either ear. But it cannot (which I confirmed with a call to the manufacturer). It can be worn on the right ear only. If, like me, you use your left ear for phone calls, it simply WILL NOT WORK."
2,Very mature,"In the ""lessons in parenting"" category, I have The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Since my daughters love Disney movies, I picked this up with several others and popped it in one Family Movie Night. What a mistake; and I will certainly pre-watch other Disney movie going forward.THoND is dark, and devoid of much of the typical Disney charm - surprising since it's by the same director and producer duo asBeauty and the Beast. There is a scene in which the priest locks a family in their house and lights it on fire, and another in which he sings about his lust for Esmeralda while watching her dance erotically in the fire. Other Disney cartoons have hinted at such things, of course, but usually off-screen or in a humorous way for the adults watching that the kids will miss. Fortunately my 4-year-old had wandered away bored before the very mature parts, but it left me wondering what Disney was thinking, especially in a G-rated film."
2,The one i care less....,"I don't like to say bad things about DISNEY movies...most of their old animations are my ALL TIME favorites like THE LION KING and THE JUNGLE BOOK...but this one, THE HUNCHBACK of NOTRE DAME is BY FAR the one i care less....it's not so inspired, and the story is not so good..."
2,Typical Disney...,"The scene where Quasimoto rescues Esmerelda from the fire is rather stunning. That is the only reason I give this 2 stars. Other than that, it's typical Disney...."
2,Should not become a disney classic,"The ending is ok I even liked the little talking statues,but the rest of the movie was boring and it was a waste of my time watching it. ""Do not buy this movie""."
4,Tarzan wishes it were like this,"Some people must have short memories. Everybody is saying how great Tarzan is, and I've taken quite a bit of heat for trashing that movie. Yet if they want to find a similar movie that's much better, all they have to do is look a few years back, and they'll see this movie, The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Nevermind that it's not at all like the book, this movie has all of Tarzan's strengths and very few of its weaknesses. Tarzan has a poor story, poor characters, and a poor villain. The Hunchback of Notre Dame has a strong story, great characters, and a fantastic villain. Both are dark and inappropriate for kids. Both have fantastic animation and great action. Yet, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is clearly the superior of the two. That's pretty much all that needs to be said. Now, if only they got rid of those stupid gargoyles."
5,lolz,"This was the dreamiest film i have ever seen where people go this guy can't, even if the worlds are against him :)"
3,"Parents, watch it first","A little too suggestive for me but my young son loves it. He's not old enough, yet, to understand what's going on between two of the main characters. An older male character feels lust, not love, for the main female character.My son likes the relationship between the gargoyles and the Hunchback. There are some funny scenes but I'd be cautious. Parents, watch it first and decide for yourself."
5,A Good Movie,"The 1st time I saw this movie was when I was a sophomore in high school because we were singing the music to it in my chorus class as a part of a show that we were doing for elementary students, and the teacher wanted us to hear the songs in the movie to let us hear how they were supposed to sound. When I saw the movie, I really liked it and knew that I had to buy it when it came out. I finally got it for Christmas and was glad. I have to say that this is a good movie and is recommended to any huge Disney fan."
3,Not Disney's Best,"I guess it's okay. It's pretty dark, not very Disney fairy tale like, but that's not the problem. Towards the end I just got a little bored."
5,Really enjoyable!,"The song from this film, ""god Help The Outcasts"", is so pretty. (I have taught it to lot of my vocal students). This is a great entertaining story that teaches a great lesson to kids , (and adults) About accepting people for who they are."
3,hunchback of notre dame,"well this one was almost perfect, but while watching it the subtitles will pop on in random spots letting me know it is a burned copy witch i could have got from anywere"
5,great movie,"I think this is a great movie. I've read the book and its VERY deep. this movie is so much better to me.And I think they made the characters more likable. For example in the book phoebus is nothing but a womanizer and I cant help but not like him,in this movie i think hes great,mabey one of my favorite disney heros. This isnt a movie for really young kids i guess but,i watched it when i was little and it never bothered me,i didnt pay any attention to the bad stuff of the movie. I think this is one of the best disney movies I've ever seen."
2,Hunchback of Notre Dame,Not what I ordered I had to send it back Quite a hassle I did not reorder the fact that it was on Spanish was not clear
5,Hunchback of Notre Dame,I thought it was breath taking a must see movie. The movie was shocking also because evil Judge Frolo wanted to wipe out the gypesies but once Quasimodo and Captain Phoebus found out his evil plan he started to grow eviler and wipe out everybody who hid gypesies or who were gypises sorry spoil alert :( but anyway watch this movie and give it 5 stars okay bye
5,A great dark side twist to it,Yes it is a Disney animated movie but hey what is a disney animated movie without it being realsed to kids????!!!!!!???It is probly my favorit Disney animated movieIt is good to me becuase of its somewhat dark side with Frolo all in all it can be handled by kids just not kids who are really young and I cant wait untill I get it on DVD!.
2,Not a family or children's film,"I am usually a huge fan of Walt Disney animated movies, but this movie is not for children.The character of the hunchback's benefactor is very dark. During the song, Hellfire,"" this character is clearly struggling with sexual and demonically depicted lust for Esmerelda. There is nothing G rated about that. Additionally, there is a scene where he tries to impose on Esmerelda and is clearly lusting after her and sniffing at her hair. He wants her to burn in hell if he cannot have her.Esmerelda is depicted as a pole dancing temptress. How could this pass as a family/children's filmBeing a Disney film, it does not fully follow the original story by Victor Hugo. I will concede that it is visually well acted, but this movie should have been rated PG for it's dark, sexual, and demonic depictions."
2,Not What I was Expecting,"I'm 21 years old. I think I saw this when I was little but I really didn't remember anything about it, so I wanted to see it again! I was actually excited to see it because Disney movies are usually always great. The script was mediocre and the music wasn't memorable. Disney movies can be enjoyed by adults and sometimes, there are things that you won't understand until you watch them as an adult, but this one seemed like there wasn't much thought put into the script. I know this is a recreation of a classic story, I don't have a problem with the plot, just the execution of it. I also found that this movie bore some similarities to Disney's Aladdin. I thought that was lazy of them to do. I didn't like this."
2,Amazon,there was a lot lagging in the video feed. We always have this problem with amazon. we have very high speed fios internet so I know the problem is not at our end
2,Cracked Bellringer,"One of Disney's weakest animated features (along with bottom-of-the-barrel ""Oliver & Co."" and ""Robin Hood""). The animation is strangely lifeless, the songs are forgettable, and -- worst of all -- Quasimodo is zapped by Disney's pixies and changed from a terrifying, nearly speechless deaf bellringer into a lovesick teenager who won't shut up; it's enough to make a movie fan look for ""Sanctuary!"" I have a complete set of Disney DVDs to date, but I won't be buying this one.Stick with the Lon Chaney and Charles Laughton versions, which are better for adults AND kids."
1,Disney is a joke.,"Disney is a joke and this movie is a joke. I wish I could give it zero stars. Why does Disney keep instisting on taking these dark, disturbing tales, such as Pocahontas, Alladin and the Huntchback of Notre Dame (which, by the way is really Notre Dame of Paris) and making them into cutsey kids films? And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending. Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE! What the heck story is Disney going to try to adapt as a children's film next? The Scarlet Letter?"
3,"""Disney Shouldn't Sexualize Kids!""","Demi Moore palys the sexy role of Elsmerelda the gyspy girl hunted down by the cruel French Priest. Kevin Kilne, (A Fish Called Wanda, The Big Chill) plays a romantic knighy who seeks Esmerelda, (Moore) and marries her at the end. (Demi Moore, G.I. Jane, and Hunchback of Note Dame 2) is dances and waves her oniporpriate body parts around! G desreves a PG-13! Read all the other reviews, sex is the main thing said! I am the reviewr of Chicago and Cold Mountain."
1,"""pass""","Try other disney movies instead or at least GARGOYLES. The gargoyles in this movie are worst than Greg weismens GARGOYLES. They aren't very smart. Instead there annoying, poorly created, dumb, and not as mature as Goliath and his clan. Basically a dumb cartoon movie with dumb cartoon characters in it."
5,Satisfied Customer,I ordered this product in hopes that it would be a good item for our family and i was right. My 2 boys loved it and the ease of ordering was wonderful. I wouldn't change anything about the purchasing process or the purchase itself. Thank you
2,Rated G?,"Parents should watch this film before showing it to youngsters. This film should have been rated PG. For example, after the gypsy woman dances in a seductive manner (including using a pole), the head of the guards lustily vows that if he can't have her he will kill her and she will burn in hell. Disney should use their influence to have this movie re-rated to PG and advise stores not to group it with the likes of Peter Pan and Cinderella."
1,The worst,"I was totally disappointed by this film. The music was terrible, not 1 ""Disney"" character to love in it. Yuck! That sums it up"
1,horrible,I hated this movie. I saw it in theater and i never want to see it again. The worst disney movie ever.
1,Rated G?,"This should be rated PG-13 for violence ( the scene whenesmerelda is burning ), cursing ( there Is a song with cursingin it ), and other very innapropiate scenes. And THAT'S onlyhalf an hour of this dreadful movie. This could also be ratedR, which could very well be possible. It has a very creepysetting for everyone, young and old, and should be ignoredby every family in the country. This movie has the horriblemusic from the same song-writer as the little mermaid. WaltDisney would be terrified if he viewed this movie. There hasn'tbeen a good disney movie that wasn't directed by Walt Disneysince Mulan, Mulan II, and the Emperor's New Groove.Disney should stop using Europe as a setting. It's booooriiing.At this point, seeing Europe is like seeing a pencil. Been there,done that.If you are planning to watch this movie, don't. It really shouldbe rated PG-13, or even rated R. Thank you."
4,Decent Retelling,"The novel by Victor Hugo is very dark, with a lot of abuse and unhappiness. This movie is not as light as other Disney films, since it shows the death of Quasimodo's mother and Frollo lusting after Esmeralda, so this movie is not quite for little kids. But it does have a lot of the usual Disney fare - dancing and singing (particularly at the Festival of Fools) and magical or talking companions (in this case, a trio of stone gargoyles that live in Notre Dame)The difference between the book and movie are startling, but the movie is still enjoyable and the book is very much worth reading."
4,Better stories for Disney to adapt,"""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is of course, a litereary classic...but was it a wise choice from Disney, to show how cruel people can be? Quasimodo is a wonderfully heroic and kind character...but is the story a good one for kids? For a child to grasp a story, it has to be quickly paced and well drawn. This (I am sad to say) fufills one of its requirments...the drawings in this movie are extraordinary...sometimes looking like real camera shots. Though, at times the story is interesting, it leaves something to be desired. Perhaps this story just isn't a good one to translate from literature to childrens movie...but I enjoyed it to a certain extent...so it wasn't a total failure. After all, isn't enjoyment the most important thing?"
5,best Disney ever,"My all time favorite Disney movie! The characters were great, and I think Frollo (the bad guy) was the most evil Disney has ever made anyone seem. Also the music is great. It's broadway style music, and that really helps the story. I also think this is the most intense Disney has ever gone. Even though the storyline is not completely true to the original book, I think I liked it better. I do not recommend this movie for little kids because it is really intense. The violence is more than usual for Disney, but it's not just that. There are a lot of emotional and dramatic issues involved. But anyone who can take this should definitely buy this movie. It will pull you in and you'll want to watch it again and again at least if you're like me."
2,"A re-hash of her other book, Stand-Up Comedy","I have Judy Carters older 1989 book, Stand-Up Comedy The Book. This is a great workbook on the comedy scene of that time. And a lot of the material would still work today. Its not the best but its okay. I would recomend Zen and the Art of Stand Up Comedy By Jay Sankey instead. Thats a brilliant starter comedy book that will see you through your professional career.So I was very disappointed to buy the Comedy Bible only to find that basically its a revision/rehash of her original book Stand-Up Comedy The Book!!!! So now I have two books with pretty much exactly the same material. The Bible does have a few extras on writing for TV comedies etc. Overall I was very disappointed. There are much better books out there. If she had just re-vised her original book it wouldnt have been so bad but i feel ripped off at having bought this twice. And thats not very funny at all!"
3,I've only started reading it.,"Since I've bought the book, I have looked at the index to find that I probably have a fear of success."
3,This is a good place to start as any....,"For budding comedians or those who wish to get back into the game, Judy's Comedy Bible is a good place to start. As a comedian and comedy show producer, I can tell you from experience that it is difficult to know just where to start. This book, along with going to as many open mics and speaking opportunities as possible, is a great place as any to start. There are dozens of books on the topic---performing, writing, public speaking,acting,history,comedian profiles/bios--but I would start here in terms of reading. Don't read it all at once. Take a chapter at a time. Some chapters may not apply to you--such as sitcom writing just yet--but just know some chapters will be helpful and insightful. Judy could stand to update (stand-up date?), the book, but comedy construction has not change that much. There are other good books, but again, I'd start here. Good luck.Mark New marknewcomedydotcom -or- marknewcomedyatgmaildotcom"
4,Comedy,"This is a great book on the business of stand up comedy. If you are looking for a how to write jokes book, I would recommend Greg Dean's Step by Step to Stand Up Comedy. However, this book does have some very useful information about the business side of comedy, as well as some good excercises that will get your creative juices flowing."
3,It was okay,"It's not a whole lot different than her first book, so if you've read one, no need to read the other, unless you like to collect comedy how to books."
3,A waste of money if you want to learn about writing sitcoms,"It's not a bad book. Though its title is misleading. It's far away from ""The Comedy Bible"" because it's mainly about stand-up comedy. The chapter about screenwriting is too basic and generic. So I find it useless for screenwriters. ""The Comic Toolbox"" by John Vorhaus is a much better book on the craft."
5,Deep Insight Into Professional Comedy,"I've seen Judy Carter ""Live"" watching her capture and captivate audiences with a diverse range of Comedy bits from sublime to hacky - and make it all work. Ive seen her do bits that other comics would run from and pull it off flawlessly.But this book isn't all about Judy Carter, its about Comedy. Performing, writing, working and breathing comedy. The book is filled with golden tips and insights from dozens of Great Comedians like George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and more.Inside you will find detailed analysis of Stand Up Comedy performance, with a line by line breakdown, a complete comedy writers reference and even a complete job hunting reference.This book is a modern treatise on Comedy for performers and writers alike."
3,Those who can't do teach,"The book is a decent intro if you have no idea of what you are doing. i have worked out some decent material following the exercises and she has steered it in the right direction. However, some of things she says just seem plain wrong. For example, she says not to tell stories, but having just listened to the stand-up albums of David Cross and Hannibal Burgess, all they really do is tell stories and it is funny. Another thing she says is don't joke about your name, but that is the first thing that hannibal does and it kills. Ultimately, i think her approach is a little old fashioned. She doesn't even talk about how to use the web to get yourself out there, blogging and the likes which is so important for aspiring comics these days. she also teaches comics rather than working as a successful comic and i think that makes a big differnece"
2,Some useful information; confused by other's reviews,"Have other reviewers who rated this so highly really read the other available books? Hillitzer's work may be somewhat old-fashioned in its tone, but it certainly is far more comprehensive than this book. I will admit that this book is better than Mendrino's book, but I felt that this book only had a few useful, novel principles (like the basic joke formula) and a lot of filler/less than enlightening material/general common-sense advice. Somewhat disappointed after reading other's reviews and hoping for more value."
2,From Standup to... Standup!,"Probably a great resource if you're interested in being a standup comic. Other than that, there's not really that much in this book I found useful or interesting... a lot of name-dropping, though! Apparently every comedian throughout the history of standup has taken one of Judy Carter's classes!"
1,Useless,"This book is over 10 years old and filled with pointless information. I can't imagine this book helping anyone with comedy. Almost all of the 5 star reviews are from 7-10 years ago. ""Comedy bible of the 90's"" would be a more accurate title."
2,i didn't gedit,"I am only a kid and I red the Comedy Bibel. I did not lern so much from this here book. IT SUCKS!!! It asks me what I want to be when I gwor up[ but that didn't not help. I just wanted to lern about comedy- what it is, insted of to learn how it is to be a comicedian. I didnt want to be in writing stand-coms or for any thing. I just wantd know the basic of comedy of how it werks][][][]]The bester book I fownd out there is THE BOOK ON COMEDY BY JAMES MAR!!!!!!! I like it that has more picurtes in there."
3,My friend Josh gave me this book,"My fiend Josh gave me this book. I don't know why the did it. I gess he didn't like it at all. I took this book and wundered why there are a ahahhah keyboard on the cover. my keyboard dodn't look lie that.I think this book relly work. Once I got it, my classmates start laughing at me more and more and I didn't even read it yet! OPnce I start reading it, I learn about punch lines and the future. I think I want to grow up to be a cruise ship entertainer. But I don't know if I have what ot takes. I was afraid to do killer comedy material but I did it. Too bad my grandmother doesn't laugh when I punch her.Josh told me he got a better book.The Book on Comedyby James Mar but he woudn't let me read it. that book looked more cool since it's a comics. I am totally jealous!"
4,Welding Metallurgy,"This is a good book, because it's open our mind about metallurgy aspect of welding process. Metallurgy aspect of welding is very important because we could know what is the type/parameter of our process that could bring us to get good quality of welding."
4,Perfect condition,The item was as expected. The delivery was delayed due to bad weather but I have receive all the information to track my item
4,"Poignant, heart-rending film; Takes you into its own world","My father took me to see this film when it was released (I was about nine years old), and it made a life-long impression on me. Walter Brennan's protrayal of a loving, lonely gradfather raising a lonely grandson (or was it father and son?), coupled with the story of the boy's discovering and winning over a lost Basenji, bonding with it, and then being faced with the harsh reality of having to return it to its owner--these created a moving, memorable film experience that combined art, sentiment and catharsis. Highly recommended."
3,Good-bye My Lady,"This is a heart warming dog (meaning it might make you cry) movie. You might find it a bit corny, but it is fun to watch, especially for Basenji lovers. With Walter Brennan as the lazy uncle, its a hoot!"
3,"Nostalgic, but dated children's movie","The best part of this dated ""coming of age"" movie was the basenji. Like the James Steet novel, the movie makes every child want to own one.Secondly, it was fascinating to see Walter Brennan and Sidney Poitnier in 1956. Walter Brennan looked old even before he was old."
3,"touching, tender","I ordered this film because it popped up as a recommendation and I had just acquired a ""rescue"" basenji. It's a tender and touching movie, not all that great, but it made me cry. My dog enjoyed the basenji scenes. It's in B&W and the tape and sound quality are very good. The story isn't all that interesting and it plays more like a showcase to introduce the basenji breed to america, highlighting its trainability and hunting skills."
3,She was once a body-builder,"THE GOOD POINTS:The book has great background information about Julie's childhood. Pictures of her early modeling days in the little town she grew up in, and 3 photos of her as a young female body builder. There is a small section (about 15 pages) which has pics of her Heavy Metal illustrations.THE BAD POINTS:Only a few samples of her Penthouse photos. You mainly see the ""COVERS"" of magazines which she posed for. But not the actual contents inside. There's also not enough pics of her on the set with other actors she worked with. Only a few pics of the popular stars she performed with.Lastly, I expected mostly eyepoping pictures. A lot of the pictures in this book are sort of uninteresting/boreing."
5,WHAT A TANTILIZING LOOK!!!!,"I have always been a huge Julie Strain fan and this book is a must have for any die-hard fan. her life story is quite similar to mine except most of my antics were in high school. Otherwise, this book is quite a read and look. Her photography skills were highly professional. And I like photography. JULIE STRAIN ROCKS!!!"
3,no music,look closely before buying. this is a spoken word only album and in fine print on the box it say not approved by metallica.it is essentially a behind the music vh1 special on cd. while this product worked well for our purposes it may not be for everyone.
4,honest and well intentioned,"This is a well-intentioned - if a bit naive and earnest - autobiographical narrative from a perspective of a Jew raised in NYC and CA. Pinkson's early experiences suggested to him that nature can restore his self confidence and makes him feel like a man. He believes that the answers can be found with indigenous peoples, such as the Lakota and the Huichols. Pinkson makes sure the reader gets his (Pinksons) respect for the old ways and his trust in the 'Great Mystery'... yet this is somehow obscured by his white man's humility dance .... all the while what seeps through pages of FOW is self-indulgence and perhaps a bit of self-promotion.Real humility does not advertise itself, Tom. A real student of shamanism does not ""journey to shamanic power"". Nor is he/she likely to, khm, write books about his experiences."
5,Very good,"I had been looking for these songs for a while. This CD has all the good songs Yuri made popular in the 90's. ""Todo mi corazon"" (from the video with Ricky Martin), ""Cosas del amor"", and ""El apagon"" are all in one CD.On top of that, I got good price, got CD in great condition, and was listening to it a week after ordering. Can't complain."
5,Revolutionary Love amd War,"A true period piece that lets the reader experience the intimate details of life and love in the Revolution. A truly rewarding and satisfying read that took me into the American frontier and into the lives of the people who lived there. A great novel for beach or bed, I highly recommend this book."
4,Great For Beginners,"I very much enjoy the idea of a 20 minute session, as it gives me little excuse not to unwind after a long day. I am inspired by Patricia Walden's serenity, and her soothing voice helps me to approach the poses with a more relaxed mindset.The only thing I don't like about this video (if I'm doing it correctly) is that some of the instructions lead me into positions in which my back is to the television."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this tape because I've been very sick with Crohn's Disease for 3-4 years now and haven't had any real physical activity because of it. I picked this video because it said ""...for Beginners"", and because it said ""Stretch, Relax, Renew"". All this lead me to believe that this would be very easy and a good way to start getting back in shape. This video is NOT for anyone that is REALLY out of shape. It would probably be perfect for the average person (in decent shape) to begin yoga."
3,Not for beginners,"This is a beautifully shot video in Death Valley. But the postures are very difficult and not for beginners. Also the pacing is very fast which adds to the difficulty. Patricia Walden's flexibility is an amazing feat but it was discouraging for a beginner because it set an impossibly hard standard to follow. This video is really misnamed ""beginner""."
2,I was expecting something (and someone) more soothing.,"I agree with the other reviewer's comments on the tape level, and would add a comment about the instructor. After having been so impressed with the A.M. yoga tape and with Rodney Yee -- who is so calming, so soothing, I was surprised by Patricia Walden's style. She seems to have quite an energized, almost loud manner, surprisingly so for a tape intended to be a ""de-stressor"" in the evening. While I realize they are two different people with different styles of instruction, I couldn't help feeling disappointed with Patricia Walden. To me, she does not even come close to Rodney Yee. I can't help but wish Rodney did the P.M. tape, too!"
4,"Not for beginners, but good","This is not for real beginners. I have been doing yoga for about five months now, and I was sore the next day. But I have a feeling it may become one of my favorites. Soothing music, and Walden's voice, make this a calming yet challenging video. The 20 minute routine is perfect for a busy lifestyle."
2,Not for Beginners,"If you are looking for a beginner's yoga tape keep looking. I got the box set of AM and PM Yoga. The AM is great but the PM is too hard for beginners. If you are like me, overweight and have not exercise in years, this tape is not for you. It would take me years of yoga practice to be able to follow this tape."
4,Nice for any Tenchi fan's collection,"The graphics are great. Worth getting for any tenchi muyo fan as it has all of your favorite characters and good storyline. Continues on the story about Bizen. As expected, plenty of humor and fighting between Ayeka and Ryoko. (tenchi has a larger part than usual ^-^)"
3,thumbs down,"This book was just as i reviewed it, just ok. there were no realive stories just a bunch of poems, i have many books of this nature and this is the only one i don't really like. it is also very childish, it doesn't really talk about the important stuff and is written and the pictures are both made for a three year old."
5,Great book!,"This book was fabulous! I can't believe how much the Matrix was revealed to me once I opened this book!! I felt like Neo going through all the derivatives, and calculations to find the areas of cylinders within spheres. OMG- I have to go- someone is chasing me!"
2,Too much of a scholarly treatise style,"I wanted to read the book with accurate meaning in English (I don't understand sanskrit) with some context thrown in. The book isn't really that. It has a literal translation in English which sometimes doesn't make any sense. The text is too much of a critical scholarly treatise. Too much is in Sanskrit, and since I don't understand Sanskrit, I don't get many things.Also, there is no Word for Word translation (which I've seen in many sanskrit commentaries). So I couldn't even appreciate the beauty of the sanskrit verses.Overall I would not recommed this book if you are trying to read this work from Kalidasa in English."
5,Concise. Omnipresent.,"Despite its publishing date, the New Rational Manager stands for what we, leaders, encounter everyday.From dealing with business associates to even parenting, the writers consolidate all aspects of life to be a focused and managable matter. Almost every issue can be broken down into phases, where in each phase there are opprotunities to ask quality questions, of which drive towards quality solutions. This book shows you how.On the overall, this is one of the few well-written books of balancing life and business."
4,Interesting book,"I liked it. Maybe it's a little bit theoretical and not very action oriented. But I recommend it, it will help you if you are in a manager position"
1,A NEW way to bite the original audience .............,All this stuff is second nature to rational managers. It was only written here to make money for guys selling seminars to irrational managers (or their employers) who can't be helped to be rational but can be relieved of some spare cash.
5,"a reader from Seattle, Washington","This book came out at just the right time! My book group is reading Pulitzer Prize winning novels, and we're scheduled to read The Stone Diaries next week. Imagine my delight when I found Werlock's Reader's Guide in one of our local bookstores....and discovered that she has actually asked Carol Shields some of the questions that our group would like to ask her! This book is filled with great background information, useful interpretation, and thought-provoking questions. If all the books in the series are this good, I'll buy them all!"
2,"i loved persuasion, but the other two books put me to sleep","Persuasion is a fantastic book which everyone should buy separately from Northanger Abbey and Emma. It is about a girl named Anne, the middle, neglected child in her very dysfunctional family, who is persuaded by next door neighbor and close friend not to marry Captain Wentworth, the man of her dreams. About ten years later, Wentworth comes back from was and they reevaluate their relationship. This is a book about second chances, love, and finding one's true identity. I really enjoyed this book, but Emma and Northanger Abbey were so boring they put me to sleep. They do not contain the same truthfulness that Persuasion does and the plots aren't very interesting."
4,Very Good,"Cliff bars are one of the best pre-packaged energy bars that I have tried. Besides their portability, these bars do a great job with providing you nutrition with such a small serving. I am amazed how long one of these bars can take me through the day. I take a few of these bars along with me when I am hiking or hunting because you cannot carry a lot of weight (ie. food). The bars themselves have a somewhat mild taste but I don't mind since the ingredients are mostly organic.I will recommend the Odwalla Bar if you like an energy bar with a cake like consistancy."
4,Out in the open,"The content of this book is very well planned out. The presentation is excelent, the writings of master Sun Tzu on one side and the writings of Gagliard on the other to direct the writings towards management is a clarifying format.Many of my friends complain that master Sun is hard to understand on his own, so I have recommended this text to them in order to direct their studies of his work."
4,Good product. Good service,The item arrived in good shape and on time. I originally saw this movie on HBO and thought it was a keeper. Good storyline.
5,Analysis of couples and marriage.,"If you like a movie with much dialogue and no action, this will appeal to you. I love the movie, the actors, the dialogue and the subject. Dennis Quaid, be still my heart! All actors did a good job. My husband enjoyed the movie as well. DVD arrived fast and in perfect condition."
4,Great Movie!,"Loved this movie! A ton of great stars and terrific dialogue~Very reminisant of ""The Big Chill!"""
1,Slowwwww,I found the movie to be pretty boring and slow. Just fast forwarded through it. Not recommended. Verbose - lots of blah blah. No thanks.
2,Un-Natural,"This movie would have been great, it would have been an excellent movie about friendship, secrets, lies, and marriage were it not for the distraction that is ANDIE MCDOWELL!!Good god she cannot act, it was as if she had the script right in front of her and she was in a dry read, no emotions, no real ones anyway, she might have been a pretty face at one point but not anymore, everyone else, Greg, Toni and Dennis i felt thier pain and joy and every other emotion they were displaying, Andie, i felt like she was bored to death and trying too hard"
3,Pension Study,A comprehensive review of pensions and retirement programs in England and the United States. The author covers the political climates that have influenced the nature of pensions
4,Solid salsa for suave dancin',Very nice for high temperatures and glamorous evenings. Que Manera de Quererte got a lot of air time in my local dance scene in the last couple of years-- its probably the high point of a strong album.
5,This book is a marvel for children,"So late to be reviewing this book; it deserves the clarity of expression of a very alert mind. This 1935 children's fiction written for boys and girls from ten to fifteen, although I can read it now with enjoyment at the age of 79! is an absolute jewel. The story line is the history of a young French girl, an orphan, who must make her way across France to try to find her relatives. Her trials are so real, catastrophes so believable and yet met without complaint. She deals with each setback with imagination and an indominable spirit, a great lesson for our youth today. If only some thoughtful producer would check this book out, he or she would instantly have to acknowledge a true classic and one that would ultimately be profitable to develop into cinema."
4,Great DVD,"I saw Roxy Music on this tour and they were fantastic. This disc properly captures their live show. Their style and music have graciously aged without that ""mere re-hashing of old memories"" feeling. The sound is wonderful and the concert footage is fairly straight-forward without annoying special effects. At times the cuts between camera angles were a bit distracting but I didn't find it overwhelming.My only complaint is Lucy Wilkins synthesizer on the first few songs. It's grating, screeching, distracting, too loud and out of place with the rest of the band. For a moment I actually thought my stereo was picking up some type of interference from a local police radio or something. Thankfully, this only lasts a few songs. Later on Ms. Wilkins shows her amazing talent with more subtle synthesizer work and masterful violin (which at the live show was the highlight of the evening)."
2,Very Choppy Editing Ruins A Great Performance,"Man, this looked like it was probably a great show in person...but the editing makes my stomach turn.1.5 seconds of an extreme close-up of Bryan Ferry's face. Cut to .5 second shot of crane camera swooping overhead. Cut to 1.0 second shot of Phil playing guitar. Cut to rapid-fire shots of good-looking female backing musicians. Quick cut back to Ferry. And on and on and on.Very MTV-looking and flashy, with a pacing that only ADD types will truly enjoy. Even most of the classic tunes are sped up to the point of sounding hyper. There is virtually no sense of the interplay between musicians here...no time to really feel the emotion of the performances. Just flash cut to flash cut to flash cut.The editor was obviously not a musician.I love Roxy Music and desperately wanted to love this DVD, but instead I pretty much hate it. Buy the Musikladen disc instead."
2,Just another reunion tour,"I bought this DVD in the hope it would replace my destroyed VHS copy of The High Road, which was my favorite concert video of a band so obviously enjoying themselves.Live at the Apollo shows that time hasn't been gentle to Phil, Andy and Paul; Bryan is pretty ageless, but even without a middle-aged gut he shows the same boredom and weariness as the other original Roxy Music members. It was a depressing spectacle, especially the ""documentary"" included in the DVD.If you can find The High Road on VHS, snap it up instead."
1,Bad news...,"The dvd case was broken on one corner, and was not the correct ""region"" for play on a USA DVD/Blu-ray play'er ( an Oppo BDP-93), it would not play. I should have water for the Blu-ray release this month."
1,"Attractive, but as an alarm clock it stinks.","When you want to awaken to a chime, you want to awaken to a chime and not the sound of a loud CLACK as the striker hits the chime and retreats. This sound makes me jump every time. I called customer support, played it for them, and they said the sound is within acceptable parameters. Yeah, maybe for the hearing-impaired. This will be a pretty clock to sit around, but as an alarm clock it's useless. Stupid engineering destroys a decent idea."
3,"not detailed, some errors, over priced","Having flown a B-29 during the Korean war I wanted to find out what happened to some of the 98th bomb group aircraft. My aircraft ""Good Old Gus was listed but no serial number or status was noted. Also the details of the final status of the aircrcaft are not detailed.I think the cost of the book should be reduced.."
4,Reminds me of me,I can relate to the Gunny in the picture. Great movie & storyline. I and others were asked to do something similar for our government & some of us were prosecuted for doing it. I understand & wish I could settle the Washington DC problem the way he did. I have some of the same or similar skills.
3,Cool guys don't look at explosions.,"Okay movie. The plot was meh, the acting was good, and the characters were likewise good. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish."
1,Not for me,Boring??? Really no story line here .. This is absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen.. Don't rent it
3,Good but lacks logic at points,"The plot is generally good. Its fast paced, fun, good action. But there are a few places that simply don't makes sense. So the watcher has to suspend intelligence for the movie to make sense."
3,3 is Lenient,"I decided to watch the movie on a whim, ended up being exhausted by some poor dialogue and lack-luster action. I rate the movie a 3 out of 5 simply because I think Wahlberg did a good job with what he had to work with on this movie. Pena was just awful, playing the nervous, smart, new-guy in a movie has seen better days.The plot couldn't have been more standard, I would have hoped for more. It's a good film if you aren't looking for something complicated and I would recommend it to anyone interested in guns/shooting."
2,GI Joe,"WOW GI JOE TRIUMPHS AGAIN GOSH!!! Sound track was terrible but it matched the inanity of the film. I know, i know i shouldn't complain - I watched it almost free. Thank goodness."
2,Stick With the Book,1. Some of the best scenes in the book are omitted from the film...why?2. Danny Glover acts like two old people screw. It's just embarrassing to watch and you know you'll never be able to wipe it from your memory.3. Marky Mark is grossly miscast.4. See title of this review above.
2,Inaudible,"This is a stylish,tight conspiracy thriller.However it is ruined by the vocal style of Mark Wahlberg who delivers many of his lines in a rapid fire mumble, making many of the plot turns incomprehensible. The audience is forced to guess at what he is saying,particularly when some of his lines contain technical jargon.In contrast, Danny Glover delivers his lines clearly and in a deep tone and is fully audible."
3,"ANTOINE FUQUA, OPUS 7","*** 2007. Adapted from Stephen Hunter'sPoint of Impact, SHOOTER was directed by Antoine Fuqua. Mark Wahlberg is deceived, shot at, wounded and chased throughout the United States. Mark Wahlberg recovers, shoots at, chases away and kills those who deceived him. A classic plot for a solid thriller."
3,A Good Action Movie,"I'm surprized at the other reviewers who expected this to be a follow-up to the departed. This is an action movie, and a pretty good one at that.There's nothing much original here, the plot is formulaic. In fact it ""borrows"" liberally from other films that I have seen. Does this sound familliar: Special forces ops gets framed for a murder he doesn't committ.From second one of the movie you probably know exactly how it's going to end. If you have watched a couple of action movies, you can probably tell the role of every new character introduced in about 3 seconds flat.That being said, for pure escapist entertainment the movie is pretty good. I thought the sniper angle was interesting, although Wahlberg's rote delivery of technical detail was lacking.If you want to sit back on your couch and watch a pretty good shoot-em up, this is probably th emovie for you."
3,The first half,was going so good. I should have stopped there! It is about the oil and there is nothing but conspiracy behind it! The acting is good with the exception of Danny Glover.(I don't know what is up with him lately!) There is plenty of action but the story line just drops off halfway through. The ending isn't what I would have liked but I guess that is hollywood. The language and violence makes this a NON-family movie.
5,Just Great,"Great image,awesome picture and sound,Shooter ( Blu-ray ) just gets you into the action from start to finish,it's a must have for anyone's video collection."
4,Entertaining and not as predictable as I'd have thought,For a genre that is usually very predictable and stereotypical this actually had a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming and ultimately it provided worthwhile entertainment for an evening.
4,Fun,"Not a deep, thought provoking artistic masterpiece but a very good action movie that delivered more than I expected. Wahlberg did a far better job than I thought he was capable of."
2,More miss than hit formula action movie,"Its too bad about this film, it had potential. Walberg does a decent job as do some of the supporting actors but the main villains, Glover and Beatty might as well be wearing black capes, top hats and saying Muha ah hah hah hah ha while the twirl their handlebar mustaches after every scene.Very ""evil government"" theme which is more and more common in hollywood today. No real surprises or thrills, more of a ""Movie of the Week"" vibeWatch The Corruptor instead. Better acting ,Better writing ,Better direction."
2,Bourne it's not,"Bought The Shooter hoping it would rival the action and intelligence of the Bourne movies. Sad to say, it missed that mark (which is admittedly very high) by a good bit. The action is episodic, and indeed the pace comes to a near halt on several occassions. And by the end the good guy proves himself to be no better, morally or otherwise, than the bad guys. Rent it if you like, but you might think twice before shelling out your hard earned dollars to buy what amounts to a mediocre pic."
5,SHOOTER,So you think you know how the government works. Watch this and it will make you think. Well acted with a few subplots that must me viewed several times to get the full picture. Highly recommended.
5,Excellent,"A decent story paired up with a lot of action. Fun to watch. I hope this is a complete fiction. Otherwise, this world really sucks..."
1,Shooter,"A hundred percent Hollywood crap, unless one enjoys completely unrealistic, shoot-em-up, never in a million years could happen, kind of flick. I decided to watchit after seeing it had a four stars rating on this web site. So it makes me wonder, are these reviews written by fifteen year old boys, taking a break from playing their favorite war video game, or what?As far as I'm concerned, the acting is atrocious, ( when it breaks out at all.), the plot is ridiculous, the special effects commonplace, and I don't recall any musical score, ( I'm laughing to myself.).It deserves less than a star due to the fact there wasn't even any redeeming nudity or passionate sex to save it, or at least give it a star.. To sum it up, if you can't tell by now, a waste of time! Watch Rambo again,or maybe Rocky again instead."
1,Great except for the Che Guevara propaganda,"I agree with what all the other good reviews this movie has gotten. I saw it a couple of years back and wanted to watch it again. I totally forgot the Che Guevara shirt on the middle. If you were ever a victim of the guy directly or indirectly, you'll know he wasn't any better than the bad guys that this movie depicts. In fact, he was worse. If just only because he actually existed.Again, someone in Hollywood trying to push their propaganda. Because it HAS to be black or white. Otherwise it won't sell. A well made movie is never enough. There has to be propaganda and boot kissing to somebody's agenda behind cameras.Of course, nobody cares until someone like that steps on their own foot. And then it's too late."
4,Shooter,"Great story, entertaining, action packed and a very believable conspiracy theory plot. Anyone intriqued by the role of snipers in warfare, police actions, or assinations and government intelligence will be entertained by this movie."
1,Discs proved to be fine,"This is the second defective copy of the Shooter in bluray I have recevied from Amazon. I have also received a copy of Worlds Fastest Indian and The Sandpebbles recently from Amazon that refuse to play. The Sandpebbles plays but only the sound. This is really disappointing and appears to becoming a pattern. ***Update*** the discs proved to be fine and it was a hardware issue. Player was only months old, but using different unit proved discs are fine, thus I recant this review. Apologies to all."
3,"its good, but bad","i know you cant expect a movie to be as good as the book its based off of but this movie had almost no actual similaritys other than (spoiler alert ohhh noooo) a sniper that got screwed. if this movie was just a movie and didn't claim any ties to the book (point of impact) it would have been pretty good. but by connecting itself to the book i expected somewhat of the same characters and story, i mean hell its not even in the same state and the fbi agent is kinda fruity compared to how he was portrayed in the book. so if you haven't read the book i would recommend seeing this movie, its quite good on its own, but if you've read the book an expect this movie to be like the book, you will be extremely let down."
4,Good Movie,"Good movie, not too deep or elaborate. Movie has a few good twists, pretty good plot, and pretty good acting- would recommend if you like action movies."
2,I didn't know there was a movie that could suck even worse than Batman Begins. This one takes the cake though!!!,"The plot was boring, the characters were stale and the dialogue was nothing spectacular. It even had me snoring before the end. I had to pop it back in to watch this disaster piece from the beginning.Mark Wahlberg was hot as usual, but next time he should read the script before jumping into a movie such as this one!Not recommended and should be avoided!Rent something more exciting and relate-able, Perfect Stranger for the former and American Beauty for the latter.2 stars."
3,"Okay, predictable plot","Usual ""government/gang does wrong to a man, man fights back against evildoers"" plot. Nothing much new. Scene with attorney general at the end would never happen in real life, but this is hollywood. Action scenes were good. Local scenes for me were very good, but that's a personal like.Worth a watch if it's a boring rainy day."
4,Nicely paced,"Nicely paced film about a double crossed military sniper. Lots of action, and a few good twists. Loved seeing the bad guys get what they had coming to them. Solid entertainment."
5,Great movie,"I only wish I had known of this movie while it was in theaters! What a great action movie and a plot line that is not only plausible, but sadly, conceivable in real life. Danny Glover;s performance leaves something to desire, but Mark Wahlberg and Kate Mara do an excellent job in this film."
4,got for a friend and he invited me to view it also,even this movie was an older one I had not seen it and I found it to be entertaining and enjoyable
5,Excellent,"Great movie, great story.If you like the Bourne Identy you'll probably like this one too.If you like the Bourne Identy you'll probably like this one too."
2,shut if off after 16 minutes,"Movies need to have an element of plausibility to get the audience to ""buy into"" watching it. The story line for The Shooter was just way too implausible to even buy into just a little bit. So it got shut off after 16 minutes. I so disagree that Wahlberg can act - his main acting face seems to be a frowning serious far away look. When it comes to a choice of continuing to watch the movie or finding something better to do, this movie loses."
3,this shooter sometimes miss but usually on the mark,"I read Point Of Impact by Stephen Hunter a few years back and thinking this would make a decent movie.I was right on target.This is a good movie with Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger a marine scout leader pulled away from his home up in the country to stop an assassination attempt on the president.It backfires and now he's being framed for it.He spends most of the time running and hiding on occasion fires his weapon on the folks setting him up.Danny Glover{who i liked in the Lethal Weapon series} plays a nasty man who keeps spewing I win you loose in Marks face.There's only one man who believes his story and they set out to fix it.Ned Beatty plays a Senator running the whole show.Its a well paced movie sometimes Mark speaks so low you wished it had subtitles,but never the less it unravels to a satisfying conclusion."
4,Mark Wahlberg Excellent as usual,I am already paranoid about the government and I already think the senators think they are gods. this confirmed it for me once again.
2,Danny Glover ruins it,It would be OK if Danny Glover didn't open his pie hole. His feeble soapbox standing ruined it for me.
1,Silly Hollywood nonsense,"Wow! Hey, let's exhaust every trite Hollywood stereotype in one movie and get it over with. Its supposed to be HE-E-EAVY M-A-AN but is pure formula pap through and through. Nuff said since I already wasted my time watching it so may as well not waste time writing about it."
2,Read Book! Skip Movie,"Unfortunately, for fans of the novel by Stephen Hunter, POINT OF IMPACT, the film casts Marky Mark in the anti-hero leading role. Fortunately, it has a grade A director, Antoine Fuqua, director of Denzel Washington's Oscar winning turn in Training Day, and the increasingly impressive character actor Michael Peña [Battle Los Angeles, Crash, & Oliver Stone's World Trade Center].Still, the viewer who cares about good acting has to endure Mark Wahlberg trying to act in every scene, and that's just not worth the torture. Read the novel instead."
3,"Great book, passable movie","Better than most movies of the type, but far short of the book and the series that followed. To get the real thrill, read the books."
4,Good action flick!,"Okay, it is not always 100% realistic, but still far more in the realm of reality then many other Hollywood movies.I loved Ned Beatty, the political message is okay, enough suspense,what else do you want from a movie like that?"
1,Anti-American Propaganda From Start to Finish,"Anti-American propaganda so blatant it would make Michael Moore blush with shame, disguised as an action flick. Whoever thought this stuff would wash has a very, very low opinion of his audience. Just dreadful."
1,Shooters DVD review,"This was the single worst adaptation of a good action novel into an incomprehensible film I've ever seen! Ghastly in every way, the producers and director chose to ignore the book's excellent plot, change the venues and the characters, mess up the action scenes and obfuscate the story line. The casting was terrible with Glover as the Colonel, a young chick as the love interest, and a Hispanic as the FBI agent. Most of the dialog was impossible to follow and the whole script failed. Wahlberg was especially bad as the hero and the film was filled with mistakes and hardly rates a single star. Avoid it unless you want to watch total confusion and the destruction of the story line in a good book."
1,Poorly Cast For A GREAT Book,"The start of the ""Bob Lee Swagger"" legacy was ""Point Of Impact""! One of my 3 favorite books of all time, (Lonesome Dove & Silence of the Lambs). First mistake? casting: Mark Wahlberg is a 2nd rate ""B"" list actor at best. The ideal for this guy is someone like a little bit younger Clint Eastwood. Make this great story a ""MAJOR' motion picture, not some watered down version. Could NOT be more disapointed. Bob ""The Nailer"" is one of my favorite action characters, and they give me Mark Friggen Wahlberg."
4,It Depends,"It depends on what you like. If you like movies like Sniper and Rambo, then this movie is for you. I myself do like Movies like this. I has some decent graphics and can be a bit graphic. Not that I'm complaining, I love a good graphic movie. Its just not as graphic as Saving Private Ryan or the newest Rambo movie. But there is enough to have you say "" That was just enough."" As for the acting, well its Mark Wahlberg. He is surprisingly better in it than some could suspect he is able. The script on the other hand leaves a bit to be desired if your into a movie for that, its a good thing I'm not. If you are looking for a basic movie with a sniper, a love interest, and bad guys you can spot a mile away with out a scope, then this movie is for you. Its a fun way to kill 90 minutes."
1,Empty,"Received my dvd for ""Shooter"" and was looking forward to watching it....but sadly DVD would not play on any of my three DVD players which are all very new. What up!!! Want to give it a zero ""stars"" but had to pick 1... Sent DVD back for a refund. I will buy this movie somewhere else."
3,Some neat bits and pieces but overall average,"Mark Wahlberg gives a good performance but the movie is kind of sloppily put together. The story line is weak. All actors apart from Mark play their parts poorly. Much of the movie is quite not-believable.I did like the (tiny) parts of the movie that had to do with judging distance, wind speed and projectile mechanics but the rest of the movie is too amateur. On the back of the DVD it says ""Along the lines of the Bourne Supremacy"" or something to that effect but this movie is like a poor cousin. Much like what the 'Go-Bots' were to the 'Transformers' - if you know what I mean. Avoid unless you're getting this for free."
4,Wasn't a bad movie- great HDDVD...,"The movie is pretty much what you would expect. It was pretty good. The HD-DVD picture is in fact- very good. A few soft areas but overall- great. No annoying grain/noise. The movie itself is a little ""contrasty"" so the dark areas are black; but that's a director thing. Great picture quality and the DD+ track is good. No DDTrue that I remember."
4,This deserves at least 4 stars!,"I was very pleased with this one. I love action movies that grab you quickly at the beginning and don't let go. This is one of those movies. OK, these movies don't win 'movie of the year', but neither do comedies (my other fav genre). This is recommended for those who like these action movies as well!"
3,REVENGE.......hot and humid,"""You don't understand how serious this is. They killed my dog.""Not to mention the vastly contrived, and sometimes ridiculous, storyline that transforms Mark Wahlberg into a ""Rambo"" killing machine with a touch of ""Terminator"" to round out the bouquet.The real star of this show is the Cheyenne Tactical M200 Intervention high caliber rifle that would make any sniper drool with envy.Continuity and dialogue leave a lot to be desired.But the body count is where the fun starts. Get out your pad and pencil. This one renders memories of ""Where Eagles Dare"" and Clint Eastwood casually eliminating those nasty Nazis.About the dog. Very bad taste. Ruined a nice reunion type finale."
3,"Mr. Wahlberg, Smile Please","I would have given this movie a 4 star rating if only Mark Walhberg could have smiled just once. The grumpy and pissed-off look was too much to take for the long duration of the film. Sure, Shooter is no teen flick or love story but even one wry smile, at some point in the film could have put the viewer at some ease. In fact Mark has been showing the same face for many movies now and it is high time we saw a change. Two hours was also too long for this movie which I thought wasn't a nice idea. The incredible hardware (rifles) were an admirable part and using them Mark is able to shoot a target from a mile away. The action is good and so is the plot and story that keeps one gripped to the movie till the end. Nice to see Danny Glover after a break though he had a negative role in this movie. Three stars for the action and story."
2,"An Unrealistic, Shootem-up","This movie has a solid concept, and a lot of factoids about long range shooting. However, there is so much political spin and bias that it ruined the movie for this conservative. Starring ultra-liberal friend of dictator Hugo Chavez, Danny Glubber, the movie is like one big propaganda commercial. It portrays a Dick Cheney look-alike as the leader of the bad guys (who are evil government contractors who sound a whole heck of a lot like Halliburton), which seems to be typical out of Hollywood now. Republicans=bad is their theme in movie after movie. When are they going to get it that not everyone is a Democrat?"
5,awesome,mark whalberg movies are non stop action... he is a terrifc actor... this movie will keep you on your toes... i give this movie two thumbs up
3,Shooter,Story was a bit far fetched for me. I could not imagine anything really happening like this. Acting was good.
1,"loser, not worth the time","This movie is lame, uninspired, woodenly acted, and poorly written. i would give it no stars except the production values are marginal."
5,Awesome Movie,"I fell in love with Mark Wahlberg after seeing this film. It is the epitomy of a high-level suspenseful action movie. He was absolutely incredible in this movie. From the first scene to the last, the movie grips you, and you want to see it again and again. I've watched it three times already."
4,Well Done,"Well done film.Kind of combines elements of ""ABSOLUTE POWER"" and ""BOURNE SUPREMACY"" into a single film.Is good to see a film that draws a clear line between good and evil, unlike the wishy washy ""everything in the world is grey"" message Hollywood tends to send these days.What prevents 5 stars ?I suppose it is to be expected with Danny Glover involved in the project, but in an attempt to explain the crookedness of world governments in general, they take a few overly obvious stabs at US President Bush that seem a bit forced and contrived and awkward.Hollywood.... unless you are making true documentaries, keep your politics and propaganda at home !"
1,"an awful, violent, cliched interpretation of interesting books","I found this movie pathetic. Please don't waste your time - I couldn't finish it - instead, get the books from the library. Totally different, and much better, than this disappointing movie. In addition to this tripeness, throw in highly gratuitous rape and torture scenes, and nauseating multiple product placements. Ugh!"
2,Lots of bang Little for your buck,Great for a 14 year old boy...... Anyone else it is nerve riding... Very predictable. Marky Mark does look great in a white feather outfit in the end.... Save your money and see it on TV.
4,"Mark ""Markie Mark"" Wahlberg Fan","Real good movie, full of action!! Being a native of Philly and seeing some landmarks I know made this more pleasureable. I have it in my collection, it's also on Netflix and in Redbox, LOVE IT...LOVE IT. Alson a big Danny Glover fan, to whom I met in a hotel during his Lethal Weapon days."
5,"A Non-Stop, Minute by Minute Thrill Ride","I have followed Mark Whalberg's career since his appearance in ""The Perfect Storm"" and, in my opinion, he stole that movie 100%. As the ""Shooter"" Mark doesn't disappoint. This movie is a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end. As a rule, I steer clear of violent movies, however this is one of those movies that comes along from time to time such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and you can't turn your head from the screen. Aside from Mr Whalberg's obvious sexual charisma on screen, his acting is remarkable and, if you didn't know otherwise, would think that this was his chosen profession. Everyone else did a great job of acting also, particularly the young lady who played his love interest. For certain this is a ""thumbs totally UP"" movie and a must see for all who enjoy an adventure ride from start to finish."
4,Like It Each Time...,"Every time I watch this movie it keeps me interested. It has a good balance of plot to action. Overall it isn't fully realistic, but that is why it isn't a documentary."
4,Pretty good movie,I liked the movie. A lot of conspiracy and it was cool to see how he got himself out of situations.
2,disappointed,as soon as i put it on ...started to skip..and skipped trough a lot of the movie..the disc was full of spots that wouldn't come off
1,a dud,"I wish I could tell you if this was a good movie or not. /there is always a risk buying these used, or foreign generated DVDs. This one never played for us. I actually just bought it again at the local Target, as I felt bad for my Dad about the other one. It was a gift he was never able to enjoy!"
3,Does what it says on the box,"I expected a film called The Shooter to be about a shooting bloke, and it was! There is a lot of shooting going on, some rootin and tootin, and quite a bit of scootin.Mark Wahlburg is ok, I like the guy, he isn't De Niro, but he is a solid, honest actor who brings his look of quizical confusion to many of his roles, and he does here as well. The plot of both the film, and that of the actual baddies, is over complicated, with the mantra ""keep is simple stupid"" so beloved (and quite rightly too) of military planners entirely absent, but it makes for a high octane ride.Not ""War and Peace"", but still an enjoyable ""beer and nuts"" film for a weekend night."
4,Good Movie.,"I feel this was a very good movie and with a great plot. But even with a headset, I found some of the talking somewhat hard to make out and its a complicated movie and if you cant hear it, that makes for bad."
2,Not Recommended,"I bought this book for my Anatomy and Physiology 1 class in college. It was the required book for the class and the first semester we were using it. Upon going through we found numerous problems with information in the book. For example, there is an illustration of a reflex on page 419 and the foot is on backwards (according to the direction of the spinal cord). This is only one of many, many small problems with the book.I do however give it two stars because the website accompanying the book gives a lot of explanations for each chapter with videos to better see what the chapter talks about.If you're getting this book for independent study I recommend something else because this book has a lot of information that is wrong and you won't know to correct it. If you have a teacher who can point out the little qualms with this book, go for it but buy at your own risk."
2,Faulty condition of item shipped.,"When the product was received, the book was taped together. and a bad tape job i might add. many pages were mis- aligned. I haven't bothered to begin reading it."
3,A&P,Unfortunately the class that I bought this text for is only for the Physiology side and I don't use the Anatomy content at all. As for the Physiology content I think that they do a very good job of explaining complex concepts in a simple student-friendly way.
3,Professor thought all wrong!,"Although my professor thought most of the information in the textbook was wrong, it was a great guide to use both online and in class. Great illustrations!"
4,Whoa!,"Alright now its been a while since I played something I enjoyed as much as this. Im not into PC games and all I can actually play is the Age Of Empires/Mythology series. Anyway, this game tops all my expectations. Its never been so much fun to blow up everything around you. Its amazing the amount of actual detail that has gone into making this game a visual blast. Its really fun at any time. I'm 20 and I seldom get time off my college life to play PC games but this one is just one of the best gifts I bought myself lately. I recommend it to anyone who likes KILL EM ALL freak game play.Notice the helicopters and the detailed maps next time your playing. For those of you confused I suggest you download a demo of the game. Cheers and good Luck!"
1,"Uhh, I Bet It Would Be A Great Game If It Actually Worked","I recieved The Hulk comp game as a gift for straight A's in school and I am very upset it didn't work on my comp. It says right on the bottom of the box it can work on my comp but NOO, it doesn't. I bring it back to Target the next day and got another one. Doesn't work either. Now I'm stuck with a software game that looks extremely promising and fun but won't work. And I can't do anything about it. So remember my story when you think u wanna buy this game. Good luck!"
3,Only Alot of fun when you're mad..,"The Hulk has really hard controls to master, and the storyline is confusing because, I am told, it was made like a sequel to the movie. The only time you get to do really fun moves is with the bosses, and then you get to do stuff like pick them up and smash them down on your knee. When you fight your standard little soldiers you don't get to do much except punch them. The parts where you play as Bruce Banner are LAME a.k.a. BORING, or whatever word synonomous to those you prefer. It's hard enough to keep you entertained for a while, but don't spend more than ten dollars on it. Great for a Rainy day though :)"
1,BAD!!!,"This is an extremely bad computer game. The first time you play it is okay, but the second time you realize how boring it is. There is no challenge in the game at all. The only reason I gave it one star was because it had one okay level, and it has somewhat good graphics. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1,GODDDDDDD!,"For God's sake did anyone else realize how incredibly stupid this game was?! The first time its okay because lets face it, it was a new game so you were dying to play. After awile you actualy start to realize how boring this game really is. Ex. Level: chemical effect, the guard who betty brant knocked out had a gun and when you put on his suit, guess what...it ain't there! Don't waste your money."
3,HULK SMASH!...your PC if your not careful.,"Note: this game will not work with old video and audio card drivers, this is the reason for some of the ""It won't work!!!"" reviews.The game does work, and that is not always a good thing since the graphics are cheesy and the parts where you are plain old Bruce Banner are boring. But kiester-kicking as the Hulk is fun, so its not all bad."
5,Great inspirational music,"Sandra McCracken's offering is one of my favourites. It is in her usual folk-acoustic style. All of her arrangements are creative and interesting. I never get the feeling that this song is just more of the same. She does redo a few arrangements from her work with Indelible Grace, but these too are good listening. On top of it all, she gets the Christian message, and come comes across in her music and in her choices of old hymns."
3,OK So Far,"I was eager to read this book after seeing several enthusiastic reviews, but at about the midpoint I'm feeling pretty lukewarm. Winner certainly doesn't have Anne Lamott's tart humor and, for someone versed in Talmudic study, she's disappointingly superficial. Her descriptions of Orthodox Judaism leave out most of its rich textures, and her attempt to distinguish between Evangelicals and fundamentalists is almost unintelligble. That said, her journey is intriguing and her writing is at least engaging."
1,Crass Self-Promotion,"While Winner is clearly a gifted writer who discusses her various spiritual conversions in vivid prose, one gets the uncomfortable feeling that she would become a Buddhist, a Zorastrian or anything else if it would make her more marketable as a young hip religious writer. While others have certainly written of (and, yes, profited from) their spiritual journeys, Winner has an aggressively off-putting ""hey, look at me -- I'm the next great quirky religious chick"" style. One hopes she has finally found her spiritual home. Her relentless search for acceptance with a religious community, with men, with anyone is sad and depressing."
5,For fans of Anne Lamott,"I stayed up all night reading this book! I bet a lot of people will make this comparison, but readers who enjoyed Anne Lamott's Traveling Mercies will also love Girl Meets God. A unique story of conversion to Christianity, this spiritual autobiography has the same honesty and humor that Lamott brings to the subject of faith. Lauren Winner does not pretend to be a perfect Christian -- she shares her questions and doubts, and, unlike some spiritual writers, she seems to live a real life in the real world -- she worries about her boyfriends, wears hip glasses and fishnets, reads voraciously. I really related to this book, and many beleivers and seekers alike will as well."
4,A very easy book to relate to.,"This book is a quick read and well as an interesting read. I read this book for a church book discussion group and was very glad we chose it. I felt that even though it's about her struggle with Judaism and converting to Christianity, it is so very applicable to me as a Christian who did not convert from anything. It reminds me of the basics of being a Christian and the struggles that we all face. The reason not for 5 stars is that even though there is a great deal of information from the author about the 2 religions, it was not a challenging book to read - but that's just my preference."
3,Spiritual autobiography,"After the first couple of chapters I loved this book. Very reminiscent of Ann Lamott, it traces Winner's conversion from Orthodox Judaism to Christianity. Seldom have I encountered a book I enjoyed more. Her eccentric uninhibited style, jumping from subject to subject, Judaism to Christianity I find fascinating and affirming."
3,"Insightful, delightful, but tarnished by excessive piety","I read this book, and write this review, as both a church pastor in a liberal denomination and a woman the same age as Winner. I really enjoyed the depth and candidness of her memoir, and appreciated the ways that she allows herself to be seen in all her imperfect humanness.That being said, I was nearly offended by the great lengths to which Winner goes to identify her ""sinfulness,"" such as confessing to a priest her terrible ""sin"" of thinking about sex (which many liberal Christians -- not Winner, unfortunately -- view with gratitude, as part of God's gift). Her ideals of faithfulness don't ring as authentic for the ""real"" people, for example, that I have ministered to in my career, and set unrealistic standards of piousness for those who are called to a life of faith.The book is also tinged by a look-at-me-I'm-so-witty cutesiness, but that's a minor complaint. Apart from Winner's exclusive view of what Christianity is, this is a fine read."
4,Captured the essence of religion in daily life,"As a daughter of a Jewish father and a Lutheran mother, I related to Winner's experiences. As a Christian, I struggle now with much of the evangelical world, which can be based upon consumerism and emotions. Winner puts into perfect description the inner turmoil many have gone through during the conversion experience. As I read her novel, it was as if she were writing my story.... at times I was lost as to who she was speaking of, seeing as the time we were introduced to a character was many pages earlier. But, her non linear style was refreshing in the Christian work of writing.I would recommend this book to anyone who has converted, whether to or from Christianity. I would also recommend this book to anyone who experiences difficulty connecting with Christ. Winner, and her icons, gave me a new perspective and drive to pursue holiness. Thank you, Lauren Winner, for your vulnerability and openness. Your book will be aclaimed by many for years to come."
2,Not fresh- stale,"I have eaten this before and am usually satisfied with the product when purchased in a store like Whole Foods. However, I thought I would try an online purchase because I can no longer get the cereal where I currently reside. Bad mistake. This cereal was stale upon receipt, not so much in taste (although it was oddly bland), but more in texture. I'm not sure whether this is because of how it was packaged but I noticed that the bags were strangely thin in places. I cannot recommend this unless you like old tasting puffs."
3,low cal/high fiber cereal/snack,"A nice low calorie, whole grain, high fiber cereal. I mix it with puffed wheat and/or rice and some muesli and fresh or dried fruit for breakfast or add it to trail mix. Some bags have too many hulls and ""dust"" at the bottom of the bag."
3,NOT for the wheat-sensitive!,"I made the unfortunate assumption that organic corn puffs would be wheat-free. The online product info doesn't say either way, but the package, once you receive it, does warn that they're made in a facility that also processes wheat. As someone who does fine with corn but is allergic to wheat, I had a violent reaction to them. They taste good, but they're definitely not for anyone who needs to avoid wheat; that should be prominently stated in their description."
2,Not so great,"These corn puffs were pretty bland. I could only get my kids to eat it by adding alot of sweetener (I use organic evaporated cane juice, or unrefined sugar as I call it) and a little sprinkle of cinnamon. I probably will not purchase again."
2,"Not Bad Book, Not Good Either","This book is ok, but I would not recommend it! The games and ideas seem to be similar to other manuals of teaching tennis to kids. I would recommend looking for coaches who have specialized in this field rather than those who like to jump on the proverbial bandwagon. Nice try Mr. Dinoffer, but a no go in my books...Dr. Robertson"
2,IDEAS ORDINARY,"I will give this book a very low recommendation the concepts and ideas are not original and actually taken from other books offered by tennis federations such as the German Tennis Federation. Joe Dinoffer needs to start writing material that he himself thinks of... I will not support this book. I am sure that the supporters of this book have absolutely no knowledge that his material has been ""borrowed"" from other sources. This book cannot be supported by any law abiding coach. Any reviews sent in after this one ... need to be ignored!"
2,A Differant Suchet,David Suchet is a fine actor. I did not find the scriptfor this story to be fine. Average. I would probably nottell anyone it's great enough to buy.
2,No,I thought this would be really good but it is not for my taste I really like 1800 movies and this is not up to it.
3,Worth it for Suchet,"I originally liked this a lot when I first saw it about 6 years ago. I recently read the book and then watched it again. Having read the book, I'm somewhat less impressed with this production. I understand condensing. However, it's hard to condone cutting crucial plot elements just so we can see extra scenes with McFayden romping in the woods. Oh well, I guess they needed to make it more appealing to the masses.That said, this is still great for certain performances- Suchet in particular. I simply loved his performance.Certain casting choices were questionable- It's already been said before, but Miranda Otto really was a poor choice. Couldn't they find an actual American actress for this role?I can't find any real fault in Cillian Murphy's performance. However, physically, he just wasn't the right actor for this role. From certain angles he looks more like a young girl than a man. His walking around in a cowboy hat bordered on the ridiculous.Again, see it for Souchet."
4,Adequate Entertainment,"I purchased this primarily to see Matthew Macfadyen. Since seeing him in Pride and Prejudice and Spooks I've been looking for other of his works and this one does not disappoint. He is an excellent cad in this mini-series, unfortunately he does not show up as much in the second half as in the first. When he does appear on screen he is fabulous and funny.Melmotte drones on and on in soliloquies in his demise. The relationship between him and his daughter is disturbing and she thankfully gets the better of him eventually. Shirley Henderson who plays Marie his daughter is a wonderful actress. When she learns Felix really doesn't love her you can feel her heart breaking. The ""main"" love story between Felix's sister Hetta and Paul Montague was subdued and lacked any real passion."
3,Entertaining,"This movie is very entertaining, and will keep you guessing what is going to happen next but simply put, it is a very odd and strange story. The characters were all a little bit strange, except for a few, and many interesting things happened. Some of it was very funny but the rest was a little odd. The acting is very well done, as are the sets, and costumes. I would not recommend owning this, but it is an interesting way to spend an afternoon. Look out for the outrageous American accent exhibited by Miranda Otto as Mrs. Hurdle. It was very amusing. She sounded as if she came from the backwoods of West Virginia."
4,Very faithful spirited adaptation,"This series is an amazing adaptation of Trollope's novel, yet at the same time speaks to a contemporary audience - the bubble stock scam, investors' greed and gullibility and the extreme corporate coruption, coupled with unreal ambition are maybe a little too typical of much we have seen in recent years.The last episode is the weakest and the ending seems almost perfunctory, but all in all, a highly enjoyable series."
5,This is the Best..It actually changed my life (i am serious!,"First of all, I am rarely a fan of shows with British accents, etc. But this mini-series is unbelivable. It has actually changed my life. I watched this series by accident but am very proud i did. THe way the characters are portrayed I was able to see very clearly how different type of people deal with the same situation. Now after watching it I am also looking at world with many lenses.Highly recommended."
3,Wonderful production,"This was wonderful - the sense of menace and waste barreling along against a compelling love story...Sir Felix is awful in many ways but I got a bang out his character; same for many of the other actors, especially Marie and her earned hatred for her father. Only objection was the truly awful southern accent of one character - yikes!"
1,review of the way we live now,I did not like this film. The characters were not well developed and some were absolutely revolting. There was not one to whom I related or cared about their outcome in the plot . I will not watch it a second time and would like to sell it back to Amazon.
5,Brilliant production!,"Everything about this BBC production was perfect. In particular, David Suchet shows that he can be much more than Poirot ;-). My wife and I recommend it highly."
4,Interesting tips and tricks to learn from,"The value in a book of tips and tricks is not the tricks themselves, it's what you can learn from how they are executed. That's what I like so much about this book. It doesn't just show you the code so that you can copy and paste it to make that exact effect. It explains each step of the code so that you learn more about the Flash platform in general. You can then use that knowledge and apply it to completely different effects.The book starts with a variety of different effects and then ends with some information on Flash forms, which seems somewhat out of place. The text is clear and well written, and although there are lots of illustrations, that comes with the territory.Anyone making a living out of Flash will want to have a look at this to see what they can learn from it."
3,The Outing,"I recently saw this movie for the first time and if you like really cheesy B movies, this is definitely one for you. An enjoyably cheesy B-movie that has bad acting all around (everyone seems to agree on that), but also some imaginatively gruesome scenes that make it worthwhile for undemanding genre fans. Inarguable highlight is the scene involving a naked girl (of course!), a bathtub and several snakes.....ugh! See if you can understand the point of the brief shot after the closing credits.It's got it all...bad acting, horrible effects, random naked people. I found it particularly enjoyable because it's set in Houston, TX. So I got to look back and remember what this city looked like 15 years ago. All in all, this movie is a good way to spend a couple hours."
3,Dark Outing,"I recall this movie from when it came out. One title was ""The Lamp,"" and the other was ""The Outing."" So far, this has been the only version I have been able to find of this film.If you have seen the ""Wishmaster"" series, you have a good idea of where this one is going. However, while the film is much, much darker (at times you can barely see what is going on), I think it is superior in many ways. If not superior, then at least original.The real issue here is it's weak ending, which is also a minor plot issue. Following closely is the very poor special effects for the creature, but then this is pre-digital days.For the price, if you still have a VHS player around, it isn't bad. Just don't expect to be amazed at the ending."
3,a.k.a. the lamp,"pretty good entertaining movie where what i remembered/liked best was finally the intro of this cra-z,evil,funny jeannie appearing 1st as a multicolored ghost filandering fast thru mid air chasin after the dumb teenanglers until it appeared in claylike phys. form. The beginning & aft mid to end had jeannie action."
1,shorted product,the game screen was dirty and the inverter was not in the box and the patch cords were also missing.as you read the ad they were part of the purchase price. i will not buy from them again
1,"For this price, it's great ... but not at the $15 Petco charges!",It is inferior to the 10 year old version I have. Pivots in a strange way making it difficult to use (followed poor directions) AND the blade clearance isn't tight enough so it leaves the 'outer shell/skin' of the nail present requiring a file or the use of my old original cutter. Argh.
1,Don't buy,Does not cut nails cleanly. There is a gap between the blade and the backing plate that crushes the nail instead of cutting it. I tried every angle and orientation but it just does not cut the dogs nails. I am returning the product as it does not work at all.
1,Disapointed and Angry,"I purchased this book, thinking the cd-rom was included, because it was listed on the discription. When I got the book I recieved a document that said the cd-rom was not included. I was very upset, because that cd was very important. The worst part is I e-mailed these people weeks ago, and asked them to to please send me the cd-rom I paid for. Of course, I recieved no response. I never seen such poor customer service and communication. I would not recommend these people, unless you would like to get ripped off!"
1,No CD-ROM attached!,Product was delivered in a timely fashion and in the condition stated but book did not come with the CD-ROM like stated. I need this CD to complete my class project.
1,Fault info,"I ordered this product as I saw Successful Project Management (with Microsoft Project 2003, 120 Day Version and InfoTrac ) but when the product delivered. there was no CD of Microsoft project, only a enclosed note on product description that "" There no CD included' ,and this CD is required for my course.I felt like being cheated, this a bad seller, do not buy from them"
4,Just right!,"I have about a decade of PM experience and I decided to finally get a formal education in Project Management. This is the textbook for one of the core graduate-level courses.The book is organized, well written, and replete with appropriate illustrations and real-world anecdotes. In addition, the case studies at the end of every chapter are very realistic.I entitled this review, ""Just right!"" because it is neither too elementary nor too complex for a student learning Project Management for the first time."
5,Vibrational Medicine: The #1 Handbook of Subtle-Energy Therapies,"It looks the BEST, #1 book in the world by its description, but I have not received it yet, and I am not able to present any comment, unless I read, understand, and acknowledge this book."
5,"Stunning, sheer genius","I've read a zillion books, but this one is absolutely phenomenal! Dr. Berg is a genius who has captured and unified a fabulous array of information. His presentation unites seemingly disparate fields and TIMES with great clarity. The first chapter is a little difficult if your'e not into Quantum physics or Holograms, but the rest of the books is easy and marvelous. From Atlantis to NOW. All is connected. Read this, and MANY of your questions about life will be answered...INTELLIGENTLY, logically and in a sometimes surprising way. It's a RE-READ book. Have fun. And Have a Happy New Life using this information."
5,The first good try to explain Esoteric Medicine,"Dr Gerber, in a very easy and plain language, slowly introduces us to the fantastic world of vibrations, base structure of all matter. His book is a must for anyone dealing with vibration medicine, be it hand healing, dousing or any kind of acupuncture or Homeopathic medicine. He doesn't try to fool you, he tries with enormous patience and knowledge to explain the up to know unexplainable by way of the most recent knowledge of Quanta Theory and recent experiences. A big bravo for Dr. Gerber effort to try to take up to the front light and analyze based on the most recent science data, those up to know so bad named medicines.Jose de Faria e MayaAuthor of ""Specks of Spirit"" and othershttp://www.josefariamaya.com/"
4,Very comprehensive,I thought Dr. Gerber's book on vibrational medicine covered various aspects of this discipline. It explained the possibilities of this healing modality giving everyone hope no matter their current health status. I really believe Dr. Gerber and other healers assessment that energy medicine is wellness for the 21st century.[...]
4,Robert's Love Of Africa,"I loved this book because it shows Ruark as he actually was through many of his magazine articles. We see Africa through his eyes and it comes to life for us. In retrospect, we see that he was seeing the end of the glorious hunting age and the beginning of the photographic safaris. As we know, he was not much of a photographer but he did love to photograph the animals as well. This book fulfilled my need of another fix of ""Robert Ruark and his love of Africa."""
4,"Ahhh, the old days...","This is pre-LA Quartet for Ellroy. Back before he found his beat-poet 'style'. Brown's Requiem, Clandestine, and Killer on the Road are just great books by a fledgling author. If you like his characterization, scene stylings, or dialog from LA Confidential or American Tabloid, but aren't crazy about the prose, check this one out."
2,Different,"I bought this book when it was a daily deal. I really didn't know what to expect. This book was just really out there. I felt lost with some of the dialogue - loopers, etc. The writing style reminded me of Catcher in the Rye. I think if you like Catcher in the Rye you will enjoy this book. There are an awful lot of plot lines going and sometimes it gets confusing because there are so many characters. The book was interesting and different and definitely kept my attention. I just can't say it was a favorite or something that I would wholeheartedly recommend."
4,Wow this was written circa 1981? Great Book!,"I must admit I bought this off my Kindle without knowing a thing about it. I loved it. The protagonist is a true ""Dark Knight."" I read it thinking it was written in 2011 and simply set in the 70s. Finding out that it was Ellroy's first was fascinating to me. If you are interested in an recovering alcoholic protagonist with a unique view on what is right and wron, I strongly suggest it to you. Very entertaining, an absolute worthy read."
4,"An early Ellroy novel, quite likeable","A good example of early Ellroy, enjoyable though not his best. I'd just finished reading AMERICAN TABLOID, so I missed his dead-on rendition of the '50s and '60s and all their sleazy flaws. This book is set in the '70s, and is less tightly-written than other Ellroy work, but is still a great P.I. novel and very much a pulp crime novel about a washed up alcoholic who gets involved with bizarre characters surrounding the golf caddy scene in L.A. Worth a read if you like later Ellroy."
2,I still like more the LA Quartet,"Well, I must say that though I adore Ellroy's books, specially the called LA Quartet,but this book has dissapointed me. It has some good moments, but it isn't enough to the boring plot. Anyway, if u like golf stories and crime combined, it will be a very good choice, it's just that golf ís not my sport."
4,A good start to a brilliant career.,"Only Ellroy could seamlessly weave the mystique of the golf course with a bizarre murder mystery. This first book is heavily autobiographical, using Ellroy's previous work experience as a former caddie, his love for classical music, and so forth. I thought this book was better than the two novels that followed it. And, no, you do not have to be a golfer to enjoy the novel."
5,"Simple, Easy, Educational!!!",This book does a great job of teaching the importance of financial independence to young children. This would be a great book for the schools as it teaches important values of life. My 5-year-old daughter loves the colorful illustrations and consistently asks to have it read to her right before bed.
5,A fun book about the value of money,A book about the value of money that kids will enjoy. My suggestion is to checkout the publisher BrownBooks for the author Matt Fuller.
1,Not worth buying,"Quality of ""booklet"" appears to be a copy of a copy. There is nothing in this booklet that is not found elsewhere or on line."
2,The second star is for Hershey,"Of the many poor films I've sat through because Barbara Hershey was in them, this is among the lamest and most forgettable. (Props to Ms. H. for having the good humor to tweak her outgrown hippie persona.) Unless you're as fond of that actress as I am, are curious to see what the pre-fame Zeta Jones was like, or a foamingly rabid Python fan, there is nothing here for you. Move on."
4,Movie Review,"If you like Monty Python films you would enjoy this film.Its an english comedy,don`t know if showed here in the United States.Id say this is the kind of film that you make a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy."
5,Comedy,I bought this from the cast list and it was worth the buy. Very funny and the great cast makes the movie fun to watch.
1,Never again with footprint,"Luckily we had a two year old lonely planet book about east Africa as well. The footprint is unreliable, maps are wrong, addresses are wrong, hotels non exist, ....It was a disaster to travel with Footprint Uganda Handbook!!Without the other east africa travle guide we would have been lost!"
3,Brings back memories,"I remember watching this cartoon in the 60's while getting ready for school in the morning. Although the animation was not the greatest, it was still a very well-done effort with good characters and storylines.I am not sure if kids today would appreciate it, with all the special effects available now, but for me, it will always remind me of days gone by."
3,Tinker Bell Steering Wheel Cover,And with this item I was very happy with the quality. But it fell short on the fit. It states that it will fit any steering wheel. Well I tried and tried and it never did fit on mine. No matter what I did it came up about an inch short from fitting over the steering wheel.
5,I love it!!!!!,I have a Nissan Sentra so I guess the steering wheel is a little bit smaller than other cars. I had the easiest time to put it on. It popped right on. It doesn't slide around either. I bought it to protect my hands from a hot steering wheel basked in the sun all day. It's a beautiful steering wheel. I got seat covers to match with it. amazon has the best price. I definitely recommend you guys to buy it. I usually don't write reviews so this is how satisfied I am with it.
4,Celia,"Es un resistente y hermoso accesorio para el carro, es muy bonito para las personas que les guste usar estas cosas."
3,Pretty steering wheel cover,"This steering wheel cover is very nice to look at and dresses up my car. The sections of black rubber with Tinkerbell are fine, but the blue cloth sections are somewhat slippery and don't provide a good grip. There are also a couple of areas where the sections of material and rubber connect that are rough and have nearly cut my hand. This cover definitely needs some redesign to make it more user friendly."
5,I Love Tink,This is a fantastic item and at a price that truly was a steal. I love Tinkerbell and my jeep is blue so this works beautifully. Top grade materials with good grip. Shipping and packaging were A++++ in my books and I would most certainly buy from this company again in a heartbeat.
2,Not a very good product,"The technology of having a remote you can use any where in the room without having to point and the fact that you can hid away your equipment is beneficial but only if the product works. There is one radio frequency and if it picks up a frequency from some where else or it is too close to your equipment, it will change automatically - changing channels, deleting programs, deleting programs being recorded. If you really want a rf remote get a harmony and invest the extra money. Returning the product was that easy. They wanted to charge me a restocking fee for a defective item. This may change but it has been a hassle."
2,difficult to setup,"I tried this unit based on the high rating. I was going to use it for a relatively simple TV and Smart DVD setup, but the RF feature was appealing to mount the DVD out of sight. I've been spoiled by the trivial setup on the Harmony remote."
1,Did not work for me at all - the IR blasters are weak,"I purchased one of these for my A/V components which are behind an solid oak door. I am not sure if the thickness of the door had anything to do with my problems, but the remote would not work with the doors closed. Also, I found it very difficult to place the IR blasters (eyes). They seemed to need to be very precicely placed, or they would not work at all. I much prefer theLogitech Harmony 900 Rechargeable Remote with Color Touch Screenwhich uses a few large IR blasters that can be positioned almost where ever near your A/V components. It also has an amazing interface and is much easier to use."
4,urc rfs200,"very useful product, this is my second one. Fairly easy to program ,especially if you watch the video first. this remote will learn any function you want to teach it. and yes it works behind closed doors"
3,"Nice button layout and RF, but macros are limited","I replaced an older Universal Remote with this one to get the RF technology. The RF works great. I can keep my cabinet door closed and I don't have to point the remote at the item I want to control. The button layout is great. My main complaint is that the macros are very limited. You can only program one on/off macro for the on/off buttons. This doesn't work if you have different macro sequences depending on what device you are using. Also, you cannot program a macro to any of the other hard buttons. You can only program macros to the soft buttons up top. The remote buttons seem a little cheaper than the last one I had from this company.This would get five stars with the following changes to the product:1. Allow macros on any hard or soft button2. Bring back the old buttons. They were plastic and pressed down better. Bring back the old plastic d-pad too. This metal one is not as good."
5,works great,"Product works great through walls, since our controls are in closet in next room. A lot of reviews stated that it was very difficult to set up, but my teenage daughter set it up within a half hour. Love it!!"
4,Works as expected,"The remote and blaster themselves are fine, and the buttons and menus make sense if you (unlike my impatient wife) are willing to spend two minutes to learn how they work. I'm using them to control a TV, a speaker bar, a bluray player, and a Time Warner cable box. The bluray player and Time Warner box are hidden in a cabinet around the corner from the TV, so are not visible to a standard IR remote.Be prepared that your receiving devices (my bluray player and cable box) don't always make it easy to find the *best* place to adhere the little stick-on IR repeaters. I feel like 1 of maybe 8 button presses is not received by my device. I'm certain it's not the remote/blaster because the IP repeaters light up. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that I don't have the repeaters placed in the *perfect* spots over my devices. There's a game of trial-n-error involved, and at some point, you've just got to accept what works."
3,Sort of works well,It does work just not as we'll as they claim. It works thru the initial door but not thru the divider inside my entertainment cabinet. Better than nothing ...
4,remote control,"the product is a fantastic help in operating multiple devices with ease. easy to set up. my only issue (which is minor but annoying at times) is the navigation (up , down , left , right) ring does not respond easily to the touch. sometimes I have to push it several times to get the response.otherwise, a great product that solves an serious challenge for one with multiple components to control (even hidden in the cabinet) rf to ir is the solution."
1,"Great idea, too bad it didn't work.","After reading the reviews, I didn't hesitate to purchase the item. Although programing wasn't as easy as described, my son-in-law and I were able to find codes, eventually, and had the unit working beautifully. Went to use it a couple of days later and the wireless feature didn't work. I could use it by way of IR but not wireless. Since then the IR feature won't work correctly on the tv. Have not been able to get a call through to customer service, as I work days."
3,Takes some patience,"This device did not automatically interface with my Panasonic combination DVD player/audio unit. These devices are common in starter systems and NONE are mentioned in the code section of the manual. As a result, every function must be ""taught"", which was tedious. I was unable to teach it to open submenues inside DVD function and must use the DVD remote for this. However, it works fine for all basic functions. RF device works great inside the cabinet and I did not need the little pigtail thingies."
5,Perfect Universal Remote,Really happy with this choice for a Universal Remote. I'm not a media techie and wanted something to consolidate my 6 different remotes. I was able to configure all of my units quickly and am happy with how easy it is to use.
5,For those that like to wander,"I like to be able to keep watching from room to room while I get things done. (I have TVs in every room of the house, barn and shop linked back to the AV room in the house.) This RF remote allows me to not only watch but I can control ALL my video sources and the switch that routes them to the RF modulator. It works from any point in my house (2000 sq ft) including the garage and even aways out into the yard. I bought mine when Circuit City was going under for half price and have become so dependent on it I was ready to pay full price to get a backup. At the current price I might get 2! My only issue was I seemed to need to train a lot of the commands instead of just programming by model number. But then that is so easy it not really much of an issue. Also would be nice if the signal could make it all the way back from the shop but 150+ ft through multiple walls, some of them metal, is a bit much to ask."
4,RF Controler is Effective All Over the House,"I have been very happy with the service provided by Amazon and the product, the RF20 and Power Blaster. Everything worked as advertised but One Major Caution. I had Two locations that I wanted to use the RF20 and Power Blaster within the confines of my home. One upstairs in the media room and one downstairs in the family room. Problem, the RF Signal from either location controls the other unit. Therefore, I had to disconnect one unit and use it only as an IR controler, thus requiring visual access to the components. I should have known better, but now I have a second unit that is only 1/2 what I wanted. To overcome this, you need to go to a much more expensive RF controler, about $300 to permit frequency adjustments. Great product for a single application. Thanks"
5,Fantastic!,"This thing rocks! I moved into a new home that was totally wired so that the AV equipment was out of sight. Much to my dismay, I couldn't use my existing remotes. This was harder to get out of the package than it was to use. If you want a universal remote that goes through doors, you won't be disappointed in this item."
3,Experienced RF interference,"Great concept but it didn't work in my home. I had all tv components in a cabinet in a laundry room off of the family room. The universal remote worked inside the room but as soon as I left the room, the remote became dead/inoperable on all components. Tried several setups of the power blasters location and the same thing happened each time. This would be a great product if it worked for me. My recommendation is to test this prior to the 30 day window closes. Good luck"
1,Not compatible with Directv HD DVR,Don't buy this if you have a Directv HD DVR. I bought one and then was informed by Universal Remote's so called help desk that there is no code for Directv's DVRs. I can program it using the learning function of the remote but then the vital 30 second skip cannot be programmed. A complete waste of time and money.
3,Frustrating experience,"I am slowly getting more annoyed with this product. It worked wonderfully for months, but now seems to be displaying signs of imperfection as it becomes increasingly difficult to adjust the volume on my A/V receiver two rooms away. The receiver is shelved in a closet, and it appears the remote works as it is supposed to only when the wooden closet door stays open. As soon as I close it, the remote control's volume feature loses functionality. Of course, customer service is only open during the week, when I work, so I have been unable to contact them since this started happening."
1,Does not emulate RF signals,Purchased so I could utilize this remote to control my IR remote devices along with my RF remote devices. Unfortunately this remote is unable to emulate RF commands making it useless for my needs. If you have a device that handles RF signals go look for something else this remote only controls an IR extender that accepts the RF signals from this remote. Misleading description.
4,Great first universal remote,"This does almost everything I need it to and my wife can still use it. It took me about 20 minutes to have everything programmed (HDTV, Cable Receiver, Blu-ray, IR HDMI switch). It lacks complete macro control (would like to select watch DVD and have the DVD player turn on, HDMI switch to switch to that input), but that's what I would expect with an entry level UR. The IR signal from the remote is very strong and the RF signal has passed through 2 floors at about 80 feet and still worked perfectly. Would have been 5 stars, however, my Xbox 360 interferes with the RF signal sent to the PowerBlaster IR extender. Not that big of a deal, I just have to make sure that my Xbox is turned off when I want to switch to watching cable, but it can get annoying."
3,Codes didn't work for my TV,Have a Samsung 60 inch and none of the product codes used allowed me to use the buttons on the universal that related to the buttons on my tv remote had to do the learning function which is why I give it 3 stars.
1,Lasted one year. Shop elsewhere.,"This thing was easy to program controls. Worked flawlessly. Easy to set up. A little after one year it no longer works. New batteries do not help it. You get what you pay for. So while the price is attractive, be cautious that you may get a lemon"
4,GOOD REMOTE BUT...,"The remote control is very good: when set up it's easy and convenient to use, has light to see display in dark, etc., BUT the radio frequency Power Bluster is not as powerful or sensitive as my previous Dish Network UHF remote control that worked through the walls easily. I am thinking to contact the manufacturer's tech support, they may give some advise"
5,URC RFS200,Product really works well. Had it for almost a year without issues. Ther range is great. We have a large house and it works from the 2nd floor to the basement.
2,"Good but very complicated product, not user friendly","You have to go through a long process to change your viewing from TV to cable. Not user friendly, not everyone can use it."
4,Too big for comfort,"I have been using the URC RFS200 for several months to control components that are in the same room and in a different room all at the same time. The wireless, radio controlled remote unit works great and it comes with lots of plug-in IR blasters. The remote has lots of buttons that mostly make sense and there are 5 soft-buttons that can be programmed. The remote can also be programmed to do macros. It has an easy to use learning feature for codes that it does not have pre-programmed.My biggest complaint is size and style, this remote is too big to comfortably fit in you hand and it does not look very attractive either. But it was the cheapest remote that could do the job, that is control units hidden away in a closet (in the basement) and right in front of it (upstairs). It has successfully combined all of my other remote control units into one, big, ugly remote."
5,Great Value- Verrry Happy,I saw the great reviews and once purchased was very happy with results. In fact the IR does seem stronger for those aspects that remain IR. The RF box just has to be close to the IR sensors and it will work great. Save your money and buy this!
3,Master Control OK,"Complicated to set up and program, but it has decent directions. The powerblaster works about 60% of the time when you are out of range for the IR to work. Resetting the powerblaster seems to help when it quits working altogether."
4,ON/OFF Macro Function NOT GOOD!,"OK, I just got this yesterday, and I found what I consider to be a serious flaw in the design of an otherwise awesome product. If you set the power on (and off) macros as they describe in the manual, the ""ON"" and ""OFF"" buttons will ALWAYS run the macro regardless of the devide you have selected. To me it would make sense that you are programming the macro to execute on the device page you have selected. For example: on the ""Main"" device page, I want the macro to turn on my a/v receiver, cable box, and tv. When I recorded that macro, then went to the ""DVD"" device page and pressed the ""ON"" button - what do you think happened? The DVD player did not turn on, but the receiver, cable box, and tv did! NOW I don't have a ""Power On"" button for my DVD player! There is a workaround by using ""press and hold macros"", but they are not intuitive. Universal Remote tech support confirmed that this is by design."
4,Fantastic Remote !,"This universal remote control is wonderful because of its ease of programming, versatility of programming, customization options, and especially its ease of use. Now, throw in the fact that it can work on radio-frequency and work very well, this makes it an absolutely fantastic remote!One bad thing - the IR Emitter plugs are not universal, they are smaller in size than normal IR emitter jacks found on other brand emitters. So if you should need to replace any, it would have to be through Universal Remote Controls."
4,MasterControl FR20 and Powerblaster,"This is a great set up for the price. It works properly about 80% of the time. The other 20% the macros don't properly work and only 2 or 3 of my 4 components turn on/off.The wired extensions that came with the PowerBlaster did not work with any of my components when I attached it directly to the IR receiver. They do work well when they are atleast several inches from the component.All in all I like the ease of programing and it is very simple to program other devices to it using the ""learn"" feature.Although I haven't done it yet, I believe it will work well for controlling lighting and fans via IR."
4,Love this thing,"Great product and the price is great for the functionality you get. I have all my electronics in a coat closet so they are out of sight and the PowerBlaster allows me to control them all without them ever being seen. I had expected to need to use the little ir extensions since the line of sight was not the best, but not needed.The flexibility of the programming allowed me to control an older audio system along with my newer components and since you can customize the buttons individually limit the amount of mode switching you need to do, so for example when in satellite mode most controls handle the sat box, but volume controls the tv. When in dvd mode, the volume is through the amplifier.The only downsides I have found so far are that the backlight is marginal, and I have already gone through a set of batteries in about 6 mo."
5,Excellent Value for the Money,"I got mine for about $80 w/ free shipping.I only have one Home Theater setup in my house: Plasma, Onkyo Receiver/DVD, DishNetwork HD Dual Tuner, Dual Output.Setup took a bit of time (you get what you pay for), I had to teach it a few buttons to get everything dialed in the exact way I wanted. Everything works.I created Power Up/Dn, & 5 ""Source Switching"" macros. I can power up & down, switch from Sat to DVD, to Tuner etc.I'm extremely happy w/ this remote and I feel that the people who bash this remote because they can't have 2 in the house or because it's hard to program aren't giving an $80 Learning RF remote with IR blasters a fair shake. Those users need to spend the $350."
5,Way better product than Best Buys,"I ran my HDMI cables under the floor (basement) so I wouldn't have my cable box & DVD player out where the TV is mounted. I needed an RF remote because everything was hidden in a closet. I went to Best Buy and there RF remote was $250. on sale and then I found this RF remote on Amazon for $90. so I decided to give it a try. It works awesome. Easy to program, works through walls & my closet door, & much cheaper. I would definately recommend this to anyone that is looking to to have a clean look to their house. You can have a TV in a room and all your componets hidden out of sight."
2,more complications rather than fewer,"I had hoped that this would simplify my life. Alas, it just added a new layer of complications. Someone who was more adept and content with layers of menus would do better with it. Also someone who didn't need to find a pair of reading glasses to operate it would do better as well.As far as I know, this device does everything it promised to do. It was a poor purchase for me because I am too old, lazy, and blind to cope with it."
4,Cool Device,This remote allowed me to tuck all my TV equipment in a closet for a nice clean look of just the TV and speakers on the wall. All but one of my devices had existing codes built in. But you can learn devices into the remote pretty easily. I'm still getting used to navigating through the remote but I am far from an expert. Satisfied so far.
2,Needs more instructions,"To manipulate several pieces of equipment, you're required to create and run macros. The macro process is completely non-intuitive and lacks enough instruction to learn. While I was trying to avoid Logitech from past issues, I got the Harmony 900 and couldn't be more pleased. Set up is a breeze, especially compared to the RFS200."
1,seller dishonest,"Well, it turned out that I really didn't need this product and it took me a long time to figure out how it worked. I gave the seller a mediocre review because I didn't think I could return it. He then contacted me and told me to return it for a full refund. (He also wanted to me change my earlier review.) I returned it, did what he instructed and now he won't give me a refund. Won't respond to my emails either.Save your money...."
1,Trial size ONLY,"I have over 30 colognes and I think this one is terrible. If you loved HUGO as much as I did (may be my favorite cologne) and just HAVE to try it, make sure you get the SMALL first!"
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I love short story anthologies, and looked hard to find a good lesbian one. Unfortunately, this one was less than stellar. While some of the stories in it are good, even great, others just aren't. In addition, the anthology itself is not very well put-together; there's hardly any information on the authors or stories, which would have helped draw the book together. As a side note, some of the stories are much more lesbian-oriented than others. I wondered why some of the stories were even included, since none of the characters were GLBT."
1,it holds and increases the smell,"my dog is very old and suffers inconsistency. I bought a pooch pad about a year ago and it really neutralized the smell for about 30 washings. but finally it gave in and started to smell. I bought the above one. there is no neutralizing of the smell, but increasing it, especially when washed. I used it 5 days and after washing it 3 times every, the smell is getting stronger every day. these things are totally useless."
3,PVD Coating On The Watchband???,"The watch itself is excellent. Easy to read Day/Night. Perfect time keeper. Great looking. However, the metal PVD coated watchband is not a good choice. It takes little to nothing to Scrape the PVD coating off of the band. Within ONE days wear, just working at my desk and the band shows wear marks down to the bare stainless steel base metal. THE METAL WATCH BAND IS THE WEAKEST POINT OF THIS PURCHASE FOR ME!!!"
4,Very Good Camera,"Very good camera for quick easy use. Photo quality is excellent, size is excellent. Speed is good--not a DSLR, but for the price, the best there is. The best camera for the price."
3,My thoughts,"The picture quality is ok. Price was good. Terrible about causing ""red eye"", if the flash is used for close-ups."
1,Never trust sleek beautiful design only,I ignored few posts and decided to buy this tiny outwardly designed beauty. It took me few shots to know its inherent weeknesses and I rushed back to return. 7.1MP ? just forget about it. What is the use of enlarge/crop a low quality/grainy image to meet magical 7.1MP ? My old 5 MP cameras are doing far far better than this one. I wonder why manufacturer missed the quality of photos this badly while other brands are doing far better.
1,No focus = sadly designed camera,"We bought this last night to have as a simple point and shoot camera for my purse and to use when we are out and about. It doesnt even FOCUS! No matter what we do, this doesnt work. Taking it back TODAY! Do not waste your time or money on this camera."
1,item not received.,The item I purchased was never received. Followed up with seller after proposed arrival date came and went letting him know I would be requesting a refund. Refund received immediately. No idea what happened to product. I would suggest to seller to use some sort of tracking method with all packages sent via US postal service.
4,Love it,"I've had this camera for 3 years now. Seems to be a mixed bag for most folks, but for me, this camera has been fantastic. I've taken it with me everywhere; backpacking through New Hampshire and Maine, skiing in Germany and Switzerland, and hunting throughout the Southeast. It takes fantastic pictures, for a point and shoot. It's not on par with my new Rebel T1i, but that's the difference $700 and an SLR will get you. I'm not sure about the people complaining about the picture quality, because my shots have been crystal clear. I've got some beautiful pictures from Isola Borromeo, the Jungfrau, and the Maine coastline to back this up.My one complaint is the processor. It is very, very slow. Most of the pictures of my dog in action are of his rear section as he runs out of frame. But for social shooting and landscape? It's fantastic.This camera will remain the backup for my SLR for when carrying around a larger camera isn't practical."
1,"Ultra compact, but poor quality","Like many of the people who gave this camera poor reviews, I always had trouble with blurry photos using this camera. I've had the camera for about a year and I've never been impressed by it. I kept it around because it was tiny (the size is really remarkable) and could easily be taken anywhere. I got in the habit of taking multiple photos of a subject using various settings because I never quite knew how they would turn out. Then I would sift through them on my computer looking for decent ones.The camera is also fairly slow, due to the use of xD memory cards, I suspect. I had a 2GB card, which was plenty of storage space, but unfortunately caused the camera processor to struggle.Recently, the auto-focus stopped working, rendering the camera useless. I think it's a mechanical problem with the lens. I'm actully pretty happy that I can throw this thing away and get compact camera I can actually enjoy."
2,Poor picture quality,"This camera really wowed me in the shop, great design, easy to use, large screen. The zoom is great and there is even a super macro mode for shooting small objects. But the pictures, regardless of setting, were really awful in my opinion. They are blurry and washed out. Other sites' reviews indicated similar issues. After about an hour of toying with it I decided to return it ASAP. I'd even eat a re-stocking fee I am so disappointed."
2,"Simple user interface and large LCD, but poor picture quality","Missing manual mode really hurts, the other automatic scene functions are no comparision to manually adjusting aperture and shutter speed. The worst is the picture quality, grainy, poor exposure..., it is worse than my other 5MP Olympus at HQ mode and definitely uses more memory. Well, its only usage is as a quick point & shoot and easy to carry camera which my wife can fit it in a purse. I will not carry this to any vacation."
1,"Small camera, fuzzy pictures","If you are serious about buying this camera, you should head other posters advise about picture quality.This camera takes the occasional quality picture, but for the most part, pictures are fuzzy and or overexposed.The size is nice (small) and its quite stylish. But unless being seen with a small camera is all you want to do (not, for example, take picture that are worth looking at) you should look elsewhere.My only regret is not buying it from a merchant where I could return it.If you want one cheap, mine will be on eBay as soon as I can find another camera to take a non-fuzzy picture of this one."
4,Nice Set,"I like the Pistoulet pattern very much. The sugar bowl and creamer are quite large, as are most of the dishes that are part of the Pistoulet pattern. The creamer could be used as a gravy boat/bowl, it's large enough."
1,I cheated with your product,"I am a customer very upset and unhappy because in his description of the product said to bring helmet knee and elbow pads and elbow pads did not bring me an offer misleading however respod so tell me who, as I guess no one, just annoying and I swallow I stand"
4,The picture is right - the description isn't,"The helmet is a very good (and comfortable) piece of equipment. My complaint is that the description says knee ""AND"" elbow pads (emphasis added). It does not have both. It has two pads that can be used as EITHER elbow or knee pads. The picture is right, the description is wrong."
2,won't sit straight on head,"Got this for our ""Cars"" fan when he was two. Now he's three and it still won't fit properly. No matter how we try to tighten the straps, it always slides back on his head exposing his forehead. If he ever fell and landed on his face, it wouldn't protect his forehead at all."
3,Cars helmet & pads,"Honestly I think this set is only OK. The very first time wearing the helmet the liner started to come out. The pads I thought were supposed to be either knee or elbow, but the straps are only long enough to be elbows, they don't fit around my 4yr olds knees. Maybe I misunderstood. He does like the graphics and does not put up any fuss about wearing them."
1,helmet doesn't fit properly for a 4-5 year old.,"Listen to the poor reviews, don't buy this product. The helmet doesn't fit properly. I would've returned these but forgot to. I ended up throwing them away and buying some at Target."
3,Children older than 60 months is recommended that you use.,Children older than 60 months is recommended that you use.If you've let the size of detail would have been better.36 months is too large for our children.But a good quality helmet is recommended.With two sets of protective gear is a good place to prepare.Here is one set of products.
5,cute,this was a gift for my nephew oh boy he loves it. he has them on to do all out door activities.
4,My 5 yr/old loves it.,"Purchased this not knowing if it would fit by reading all the reviews but gave it a shot ,knew i was only getting one pair of pads too but ok ,My son which is a slim 5y/o fits perfect no problems here ,recommend to all ...note he wears it watching movie over and over..."
3,The said there was no 5 pack.... a listing error...,"Just to be fair, these are GREAT clamps. I ""bought"" 2 sets of 5 from one of the listing companies = 10 clamps. What I received was 2 clamps. They said it was a listing mistake, that Irwin does not even make a set of 5 clamps, so I got only two for about $60. (That is pretty high overpriced for a pair of single clamps I can buy locally for about half that much.) When I was told I was buying 10 for that amount of money.They nicely provided a UPS return label, but here it is, still listed as a set of 5 from the factory. Nice clamps though....."
2,For the Choir,"Santayana has a flowing style and is a master of rhetoric. Do not read this work if you are looking for a well argued thesis. He lets points stand on sweeping generalizations that will only be accepted by those already in agreement. Santayana's critiques of religion rest upon sociology rather than philosophy, and his appreciation of religion is limited and patronizing."
1,Ruined my home with charcoal dust!,"I purchased this ""air purifier"" from a local retailer with the thought it would clean the air in my home. After the first week of using the product I began to notice a fine black dust around the rooms I was using it in. The BLACK DUST problem became worse and as it turns out it was from the carbon(charcoal) filter in this air purifier. The unit blows (exhaust) air straight up--about like a box fan on ""High"" setting. It does not clean off very easy as the dust particles are so fine and now I must repaint the rooms I used this in. I am returning this to the retailer tomorrow!"
3,Don't notice much difference in air quality,This unit is large and noisy on the medium and high settings. It moves a lot of air.I run it in the bedroom at night as much for background noise as for purifying. It seems to help a little with allergies with some odors. But I can't say that I've noticed any significant changes in air quality.
2,defective unit,We have the larger Honeywell model and it works fine. Unfortunately this one must be a lemon - the entire unit shakes and vibrates and the fan groans. Amazon will be shipping a replacement.Hopefully it will operate as smoothly as our other Honeywell air purifier.
3,Moves a lot of air but has some flaws,"I have one of these and three 50250's. the noise factor is pretty much the same. Higher air movement setting the higher the noise level. Purifies air well. Honeywells are best bang for the buck. This model tends to vibrate like its slightly off balance. This is common, but you can see it and hear the uneven sound. None of the larger units do this. Would give more stars if it did not. Still performs its task without any other issues. Most including myself find these too noisy for bedroom. I have a Winix for that.As always if you have any questions ask."
4,Not very quiet fan motor.,"The air purifier works very well to remove allergens. It covers a large area and moves a lot of air. Only issue is the noise level of the fan motor. It has 3 speeds and the two higher speeds are very noisy. The low speed is also louder than you want to hear. If you can put it away from the TV area in another room, it will be ok. If you need white noise to sleep, this will be good for that. It is too large for just a 8 x 10 bedroom. Good for a condo or townhouse."
4,"This is a very good, ""true"" HEPA ""99.97% clean"" air filter. The filter, however, is really only a long life filter.","I bought this exact same unit 3 years ago, and for the price it's hard to beat. It died recently(motor ball bearings failed)and even though it had a limited 5 year warranty, I had to throw it out since I lost the receipt... who repairs things these days, anyway?At 3 years old, it has cost me about .10 a day for ""True"" pure air to breathe. The semi-permenant filter will clog over time and vacuuming will only delay this from happening. Be forewarned, there is NO replacement filter available for this unit, so consider the unit disposable."
3,Pollen allergies,"I bought this product for my pollen allergies, not sure if it helped. I do not turn it on very much either because of the noise."
3,Honeywell 50150,"This HEPA air purifier does its job well as far as cleaning the air. I run it in my bedroom, with the door closed, during the day. My furniture is black and the dust seemed endless. The Honeywell 50150 eliminated the daily dose of dust brought in by my Lab. Unfortunately, the so-called ""white noise"" is overwhelming. Even set on lowest speed, it sounds like a train passing through the room! The machine could definitely use more sound engineering to be really worthwhile."
4,Very Nice,"I purchased 2 of these and i will tell you what. They work better than the $400.00 unit it replaced. This item really works folks. I have bad allergies and a cat, these have reduced my allergies inside to about nill and the air in my house is clean!! I love these and highly recommend them. Be sure to put the other filter on when you get them before running, unit has a filter that can be cleaned and a filter that you should replace eery now again. Very nice product, well worth the money, and not that loud."
3,Be Aware- Older model being sent,"I placed an order for this item based on the good reviews and the new permanent HEPA filter. When I received it, it was indeed the 50150, but obviously an older model, as the product did not match the photo, and the HEPA filter required replacement (the specifications on this page list a permanent HEPA). Customer service immediately sent me a new one, and once again, I received the same older model. While the product seems to work fairly well, buyers should be cautious that Amazon may not be sending you this newest model."
2,Not as described,"This air cleaner seems to work well, but as other reviews state, it's quite loud, even on the lowest setting. The description mentioned that this was the (newer) model with the permanent HEPA filter, however the unit I received was the (older) model with filters that require periodic replacement. The response from Amazon after inquiry to get and exchange for the described unit was ""We are not currently set up for exchanges..."". They went on further to say: ""I've checked our records and see that you placed an order for the Honeywell 50150 version of this item please note this version does take a replacement filter."" although the description clearly stated otherwise. The lesson learned is not rely on the descriptions given by Amazon, but look at the model number and research elsewhere what the item you're buying really is."
4,Second One,"I bought this to replace a Honeywell 50150 that had a bad motor. The first one lasted about 15 years. After considering the newer models/brands that claim to clean the air from a small package with very little noise, I decided to simply replace the old one with the same thing. The design has changed a little over the years (the base has feet and the speed dial has some blue LEDs) but is basically the same thing as my old one. It works well. Because these devices actually move some serious air, there is some wind noise but the low speed is very quiet. The manufacturer recommends placing this 3 feet from any object to allow proper air flow - is that really possible? Are you supposed to put it in the middle of a room? Mine sits in the corner and works just fine."
2,VERY LOUD!!!,"I bought this for my baby boy because he is allergic. The filter seemed to make a difference in the air of the room but it's sooo loud that I couldn't run it during the night. I had to return it, because the idea is to run it at nigh and all day while he sleeps.So if you are looking to buy it for a room that you actually sleep in. DON'T BUY IT!"
5,It's been working great,Bought this for my sisters bedroom and it's been working great. During the day It's usually on high and at night it's on low. It's been running for about 3 months nonstop. Have tested the air with UV light and Laser and this thing really cleans the air. Considering all the stuff that are in the air this unit does the job with minimal expense and great efficiency. If you have an infant or a toddler this is a must.
4,Lots of Fun,My 3 year old really enjoys playing with this play doh set. We now have a big tub full of all the play doh sets that he has and it's a big production when we drag it all out to play! Keeps him occupied for quite a while and it's not too difficult to clean up - just need to drag out the vaccuum cleaner to get the little pieces too small to pick up. :o)
2,Kind of dry writing...,"I found this book to be a bit dry reading - not enough pictures and she gets bogged down in boring details. I do admire the author for bicycling, for the most part, on her own, and in dealing with the people of the land, without incident."
4,very helpful info about alcohol and its effects,although the film is a bit dated (appears to have been made in the 80's) the information and research presented in the film is priceless. Interviewed are doctors and researchers who explain the effects of alcohol on the brain. Also discussed are the legal consequences that occur when alcohol is abused.* recommended viewing *
4,A wonderful story of the evolution of a soul...Iyanla's.,"For those individuals who are disappointed with an autobiographical sketch, I say: ""If you cannot learn from another's story, you cannot learn from your own."" I appreciated Iyanla's journey.The book is filled with subtle enlightenments for the reader to discover. For example, I found it fascinating that the very ritual which was used to abuse her (a bath) was in the end what gave her a sense of ""cleansing her soul"". I also noticed that she wore a bangle on the back cover photo. Nett would have noticed that, too.For those readers who are disappointed that Iyanla did not give us ""more"" on how to grow, remember that good teachers do not give us the answers, they give us the tools to discover our own.Thank you, Rhonda and Iyanla, for inviting us to see the evolution of your soul."
5,Time for a breaking,"More than anything I am grateful for those that reveal steps in their life's journeys in order to help others be free. Reading ""Yesterday, I cried"" began to speak to my soul about life and the things we sometimes allow to hold us in bondage.This book also opened up my eyes to take a closer look at my children and the relationship I have with them. It was like an awakening for me and I am now more cautious. I now realize that they don't see things as I do. This book helped me on my journey to just being real with me."
5,An amazing struggle of the heart of innocence!,"I read this book in the car while returning from my daughter's college graduation. I didn't want to put it down. It was a refreshing change to read a biography about a horrible childhood that was written with so much love & innocence that I wasn't blubbering & boo-hoo-hooing all over everywhere. Bravo to Ms. Vansant on her remarkable ability to not only survive the tragedies of her childhood, but to overcome them & also rise to what she's become today. She must be an extraordinary person. This is the first book I've read written by Ms. Vansant, but I will definitely seek out others."
4,its an inspiration,"Vanzant is an excellent auther. She has seen the light at the end tunnel, Iyanla never gives up and looks for help in her time of need. She has really inspired me to keep going no matter how bad it gets. Yesterday I Cried- I think everyone should read because it gives you the boost that you will need to keep your head up and never let nobody hold you down."
5,I WAS SMILING THROUGH MY TEARS,"I am 53 years old, have been married 3 times,and until today have looked to others for love and validation. I have raced through life like an out-of-control train constantly reaching out to others....until now...this book stopped me in my tracks and gave me immediate peace. My heart is full and there is a new world out there just waiting for me. I normally pass on books to my friends after I have read them. This book, however, is for my newest and very best friend..Me!"
5,For those who think it is impossible to do the impossible!!,"Iyanla's message of hope evokes inspiration to all who are graced by her words. Her testimony of her life's experiences has opened my life to a greater sense of purpose. I have always suspected, but never knew for sure, the power that resides within my will. Now, with confirmation of her experiences, I draw upon her strength to build my own. Yesterday, I cried, too. But now, my tears are no longer in vain. A masterful journey into self discovery and empowerment for all to experience. Kudos, Iyanla!"
5,Truly Outstanding,"I have always been very astounded by Iyanla's tribute to life, commitment to truth and desire for love. She has truly opened up in such a clear and focused way, that it allows others to do the same. Even if she has told many of the stories again as we all have, one ounce of relevation that one finds to change and to love goes a million ways. If you know someone who can benefit after reading pass it on, but I have found it a book to back to again. Just wonderful and a blessing!!!!"
4,"Inspiring, down to earth, articulate.","Iyanla Vanzant is an articulate and self-revealing writer of rare humanity and feminine insight. Yesterday, I Cried is a must read for any ""survivor"" of *any* color."
5,Phenomenal Read! Iyanla gives out Life Lessons!,"Although I have not experienced all the abuses and the hardships that Iyanla has...this book is totally relatable. Either you have or someone you know has been through similar journeys. From physical abuse to mental abuse. As a woman, I have been in relationships when it the time has come to let go, but I wanted it to work soooo bad that I held on. That is the wrong thing to do! Iyanla explains why. Iyanla tells her story in a brutally honest forum. I have recommended this book to several of my girlfriends. I think its a MUST read. Healing means to acknowledge the past and embrace it and move on. If you want inspiration and you want to learn about healing, reconcilliation and personal strength---this book is THE ONE! Everyone might not like the book or embrace it, but if you do ""get it"" your life will forever be changed."
5,"Very powerful, thoughtful book","Heard YESTERDAY, I CRIED by Iyanla Vanzant . . . it is a powerful memoir by the best-selling author (known to regular OPRAH viewers) who has had an amazing and difficult life . . . yet I never got the feeling she was ever painting herself as a victim; rather, it seemed she was writing to help work out her problems . . . and, in doing so, she was showing me how I could work out mine.As she notes, ""Life is about clearing up the crap and, while you're doing it, being OK with the fact that you have to do it.""However, she cautions: ""You can't get caught up in the crap! If you do, you will surely lose sight of the real meaning of life and lose your self.""The cassette version concludes with a magnificent rendition of ""Today,"" a song written and performed by Terry Bradford."
5,"Excellent, a review of life and lessons learned","To say that when the student is ready the teacher will appear rang for me with this book. I found so many answers to questions that have plagued me for many years. I feel that I will now be able to overcome a lot of guilt over mistakes that were made in human error and for my own lack of understanding and education in many matter's. I know much has to do with the time in which I was raised. When I see my grandchildren now, I tell them how precious and beautiful they are and how welcomed. That they are smart and good.That they can accomplish anything they set thier mind to and become what ever they want,one granddaughter wants to be a doctor, I shutter when I think what would have been said to me as a child, had I stated such a dream as this. I tell my children how much I love them and how proud I am of them, I'm blessed as a mother and a grandmother. Thank You Iyanla for sharing your story, my heart cried for Rhonda, but she was a powerful teacher."
3,Not what I had expected,"I think I expected something more applicable. Here we have wonderful titles for each of the chapters implying that there will be life lessons offered for the reader. Instead, you get an in depth look into Iyanla Vanzant's experiences and struggles. She didn't get where she is today on an easy path, that is for certain. Still, I would have liked a little more about how these lessons apply to all of us. Also, I found myself uncomfortable with certain parts of the story . . . Vanzant clearly has a very loving relationship with her older daughter and the sometimes blatant favoritism she shows this child made me feel sad for the other two children. I am sure that is not her intention in sharing but I still felt saddened, not uplifted, by this book."
4,Spoke to my heart,This book was written for me. I can relate to the story. Gives you hope and inspiration. Iyanla hasn't let me down yet. You'll want to read this book over and over. I even bought the book for a friend of mine.
3,Too Much Like Interiors!,"This book reads alot like Interiors. I agree with the other readers who called it, ""Interiors retold in a different way."" In my opinion, there's not a whole lot of new material discussed in it and that fact made the book a big disappointment for me. Never the less I love Vanzant and will continue to read and learn from her work.Viewed without having read Interiors other readers will probably find this piece as exhilarating as all her others."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!,"I Just love Vanzant and always will be a big fan , but this book is so redundant , nothing new in it for those who already knew her and her philosophy .It makes me CRY for my wasted money !!!!!."
1,Very misleading.,"Although the book itself is interesting, it is very misleading. She should state that it is her autobiography and really nothing more."
1,Same material previously covered.,"This book was not what I was expecting. This is actually a re-written version of many of her books. I believe it's time for Iyanla to move forward and leave the past behind. I have almost every one of her books and have been delighted by them all. This one however, was not meant for those of us that have several of her books."
3,A Hard Life Growing Up-Slow to learn lessons in life,"I agree with the other reviewers. The poem made me shed tears. I loved the first chapter. Then, after I read the entire book and knew the WHOLE story, I think that Ms. Vanzant should have attempted to end each chapter with her life lessons a little better. I felt each chapter was wonderfully written, then as the climax of the chapter peaked, it ended. There I was hanging from the climax wanting a better explanation of the lesson that she learned in life and because she wrote this later in life, what should she have taught her children,students, etc."
2,Same thing different book,"I was dissapoined in this book. You can only tell your story so many times in so many ways without it getting boring. I waited so long for this book to come out that it was a real let down. The best part of the book was her letter to her son. I love you Iyanla, please hurry out with a new book."
1,Very disappointed,"When I read the book In the Meantime I thought to myself: ""Wow here is someone who could put the exact words to my thoughts. Who is giving me a guiding hand and an encouragement to do what I must do."" I was elated, I loved this woman who gave hope and courage. I was enthralled to find out that she wrote another book: Yesterday I cried. I waited for it to arrive very impatiently. But what a disappointment! It was just a self celebrating ans self ego building essay. What a pity that materialism corrupts even the best souls."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Having enjoyed Iyanla's TV show, I looked forward to reading one of her books. This is my first one, and I must say I'm disappointed. I found it depressing. It's the story of her life, so maybe that couldn't be helped, but I'm wishing I hadn't read it (Not that I've read every word. I had to skim over parts that were too way out for me). She has some good things to say in it, but the packaging was too melodramatic in my opinion."
2,"Good Book, Poor Quality Edition","I loved this book, but unfortunetely I did not read the one that I ordered from Amazon. This particular edition is in small print and it was hard for me to read it. So I ended up buying it at a local bookstore where the print was bigger and much easier to read. So if small print with no space in between the lines bother you, this may not be a good edition of the book to purchase. But please purchase a copy of the book. It's a wonderful story with great lessons to be learned."
1,I'm glad this was a library book!,"I had heard of Iyanla as inspiring and wonderful, so when I saw this book on the new book shelf I decided to give it a try. Expecting enlightenment and motivation as the cover promises, instead I found rather disturbing recollections of her life and constant proclamations of how blessed she is because of it. Not only did I miss the point of the lessons I could stand to read, but I'm rushing it back to the library early."
2,Would have been an interesting and moving story...,"If only Iyanla Vanzant could actually write a coherent sentence. I could have been brought to tears reading the book, but I couldn't get past the ""tenth grade"" style of writing that seems to persist in all her works."
3,Very informative yet not too entertaining,"This book is a fairly comprehensive report on the ancient mayan city of Copan. I say that in the context of having no experience in the field of central american archaeology. If you're searching for a really in-depth explanation of all aspects of Copan, you may want to seek elsewhere. If you're like me then this short book should suffice.Like the title of my review, I found this book to be informative yet boring. It upheld it's purpose for me, which was as a resource to writing essays on Copan...but don't get this book and expect to go for an adventure because it will leave you yawning."
5,A Page Turner!,"From the first page, I was ""sucked"" into this book. The characters were interesting and real. I found myself thinking about the characters and the story throughout my day. I couldn't wait to see what would happen to Maggie next. I really liked the fact that Maggie is a teacher - I could relate to her thinking (I'm also a teacher) as she solved the mystery. The author wrote a suspensful and thrilling mystery. You'll love it! I've told all my friends about it!"
2,Poor Craftsmanship,"These latchest just simply do not last. I have never had one of these latches last more than a year, and if the latch is stored in a harsh environment, they last even less time. Poor quality IMO."
3,"seller was great but,..","disappointing that these need replacing every year,.. The cooler came with a Brand New Boston Whaler,..I would have thought they would have used a better product"
5,Igloo cooler replacement handles,"After my large puppy chewed the handles off my new Igloo cooler, I was not happy. But finding these replacement handles was perfect. Now my cooler is back to being as good as new. Also, this was a better deal than ordering the handles direct from Igloo which had the handles on an extended back order, in addition."
3,Very basic guide to Technology,I had to read this book for a class. If you are using a computer to read this review then you will be bored to tears by the first 200 pages of this book. That being said I did learn a few things I didn't already know and I am currently succeeding with technology so mission accomplished for this book. I passed it on to my father who knows nothing about technology and he has learned a lot from it so far.The only mistake I found in this book is a picture on page 278 that lists a cable as twisted pair but is actually an electrical wire.
2,Pain relief,"I bought this as an alternative to Tylenol because it is natural, but it didn't work on my headaches at all."
2,Not what I expected,The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night.
3,Great fun,"I just received my xaivx with tennis today and already love it. It was very interactive and fun to play doubles especially using a projector system against the wall. I just ordered the baseball version too. I hope they come out with a samurai sword and fighter type games in the future because I will buy them too.The rackets seem to sense when they are being swung, you dont have to be that accurate with placement of the racket but timing is important. It was a lot of fun, it may get boring soon but I will have baseball by then. Also, the rackets are wireless which is very nice."
3,poor product,"the delivery was great came on time but the material itself is very poor; there are missing holes so you have to make it and since the direction doesn't state where then you have to guess, which sucks big time."
1,NOT AUTO FRIENDLY,"This compass may work well on boats, but it does not have enough adjustment flexibility to compensate for all the electrical influences in a car.If you don't position it exactly right, including making some some adjustments, it becomes unless in any any other placement you may want to consider.The limited amount of adjustment available on this compass, does not give you much of a choice where you set it up.I would not recommend this compass if you are considering using it in a car."
4,Good little lighted compas,"This was and exact replacement for one that had weathered after thirteen years. Only problem is same as orginal, can not tighten mount enough so the compass will stay level. Must put something under the front of it."
5,compass,"excellent small compass, ideal for center consoles when there is only limited space to spare.I use it on a 16 feet boat. Quie accurate and easy to read."
3,Good quality compass but the adhesive didn't hold and wire is too short,"The compass itself is good and fits perfectly on the dash of my boat. But.... the adhesive tape they supplied kept coming loose in the heat of the summer. I had to find some small screws, drill some holes and permanently attach it. Not an issue for me as I plan to leave it there but may be a problem for others. Also, the wire they supply with the compass that powers the light for night time illumination is very short.... only about 12 inches long. It would not reach the power block under the dash so I had to splice on an extension which was a bit of a pain. It would seem that the penny or two that it would cost to make the wire at least 2 feet long would be worth it. It is much easier to shorten it then to lengthen it. Otherwise, it looks and works great."
4,Works great!,"I ordered this product after losing the original charger that came with my camera. As far as I can tell, this is an exact replacement and works great."
4,POWERPUFF GIRLS,"THIS POWERPUFF GIRLS VIDEO ""WHAT'S BUGGING BUBBLES"" WAS FUN AND FUNNY, MY THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAT TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER. THE CHARACTER BUBBLES IS FULL OF SURPRISES AND IT SHOWS GOOD CHARACTER FOR MY DAUGHTER. I HAVE TO LIMIT THE VIDEO TIME IN REGARDS TO THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!"
5,A Charmer,"A charming story of three nice people becoming a family as they undertake the renovation of a gigantic barn. I was awed by the amount of work the author and his lady friend were able to accomplish in one year. One irritation, though: the author's misuse of ""lay"" as the past tense of ""to lay,"" as when he notes that he ""lay the planks across the bed of the truck."" (It should be ""laid"" across the truck. ""Lay"" is the past tense of ""to lie,"" not the past tense of ""to lay."" I notice this same error cropping up in lots of supposedly literary books.) It's a consistent mistake throughout an otherwise erudite and often memorable narrative."
1,Burn the Barn!,"This is a slow, boring, monotonous play by play of almost every minute of this mans boring life.It was so hard to get through because the book has no story to it at all. It isn't even worthy of a proper review.Being the glutton for punishment that I am, I am now trying to read another book of his. So far it is just as bad! People keep giving him such high praise that I am trying hard to find something good out of all of his works. So far its not happening!On the up side, I did buy this at a $1 dollar store (that alone should have told me how good the book was going to be) so thankfully I am not out any money! Don't waste your time or money!By the 9 whole reviews before me, it shows that not a whole lot of people are reading it anyway. But if you do feel compelled to read it~ rent it from the library!"
2,Block that metaphor!,"Where's the plot? The barn's already been converted into a house. There are no really big adventures to deal with and no real excitement unless you consider insulating a building exciting. (Just keep imagining the pulsating punch of the staple gun and maybe you'll get deeply into it...) The other big problem is that the author can't restrain his desire to describe everything in terms of a big, somtimes unbelievably cloying, metaphor. I wanted to scream, ""Enough already! Just describe it succinctly and move on."""
4,2 thumbs up for Sacrilege!,"This is an older movie but good, in a twisted erotic sort of way. Not for kids, have seen worse on HBO series of ..The Tudors, for example and Rome. . But still it's not for kids. I liked the characters in the movie. I had forgotten it was italian made. There's no subtitles. Color not black & white."
5,Find this book and read it,"A groundbreaking book when it came out.For the past 20 years, Chester Finn has been a behind the scenes and in some cases, in front of the crowd leader for most of the great education reforms that have occurred in the past 20 years. Having had the great fortune to be one of Finn's students at Vanderbilt many years ago, I have had a chance to read the plethora of great books and articles that Finn has published. This is another in that series. Don't just buy this book and The Educated Child (which apparently is a huge bestseller) go back and buy all his books. Finn is a great academic who is blessed with an ability to communicate to the common person.Finn may talk about the education that children receive but he is the best educator a parent can ever find.Don McNay..."
3,Rhythm is it!,"Hi...A good friend from Holland told me about this movie. I have recieved it okay, however my player will not recognize the disc. Do I have to have a blue-ray device to play this? :("
3,nice bracelet,i purchased this bracelet because i liked the two tone colors and thought it would look nice with some of my clothes for work. i like the bracelet alot and it has alot of shine and is very pretty but i find that the clasp isnt as sturdy as it should be and it falls off easily. Other than that i really like it.
4,Lots of fun for the kids,"It wasn't quite as big as I expected but what fun the kids had with it! Christmas morning they didn't get too excited as I hadn't set it up yet. Once it was up in the backyard however, it was a whole different story. They even liked laying it down on its side...gave them more room for more kids! It's pretty rugged but it's not waterproof. But in AZ and SoCal, who cares?"
1,Harrassing film,The characters in this movie are awfully unlikable.Leading the pack is one bodyguard-type who right to a ladie's face tells her he wishes she was dead so he could investigate a murder. Lugosi's good but he can't compensate for incredibly unlikable characters. Nice looking cinematography and beautiful leading lady (not Lugosi).
2,Bela in Living Color,"""Scared to Death"" (1947) is a bizarre mixture of horror, mystery and comedy. The low-budget production remains notable for being the only color film to star Bela Lugosi (who wears his Dracula cape in yet another red herring role). Another unique distinction is the jarring flashback structure - with narration provided by a dead woman in the city morgue! The B-movie cast includes George Zucco, Molly Lamont, Angelo Rossitto and the archaic comic relief of Nat Pendleton. Running 67 minutes, ""Scared to Death"" benefits from Bela's striking Cinecolor presence and its decidedly weird atmosphere. Not a particularly good film, but a watchable curio."
5,There Is More Then You Think,"As I read this book I thought is this real? I read it over a long period of time. There are many people who are writing books with channeled messages inside. This book though was written when there basically was no other channeled material out there. Is all this true? Does it make a difference? Who are these beings anyway? As I walk through my days I have found that most religions are extremely limiting. This book kinda introduced me to a more expansive idea. Even Earth based religions or paths are limiting, but I think there is more. This book and the others in the series gives a suggestion of something more expansive, more creative. Is it real? I don't know and I don't think it matters. Now there is the idea of something more."
5,Great Knowledge,I loved this book so much that I had to order everything I could find on Ken Carey. I have heard similar truths from other sources but I got more insight from his readings. Thank you Ken Carey Wherever You Are....
3,interested in extra-terrestrial life,"I wanted to know (assuming there is extra-terrestrial life out there--other beings in the universe) what they had to say to us and what, if anything, they could do to help us in our search for truth and purpose in the universe. The book was not easily comprehended by me, but I have read many books that talk about intangible concepts that most people in this world do not comprehend let alone acknowledge. I know from experience that I have to re-read the book and will learn more each time. I feel, all the same, like my soul is being fed and nourished. I honor the divine within Ken Carey in his journey to make tangible the messages many of us long to hear and be a part of."
4,A pretty cool book,"I just finished reading this very old book, first published back in 1982. You can see where authors such as Eckhart Tolle, Marianne Williamson, Abraham Hicks, and many others got their some of their ideas. It's kind of a hippy version of all of the above. Non dualist thought, with a few quantum physics fluff ideas and alien population theories thrown in for good measure. All in all, a very interesting read."
4,Return of the Bird Tribes,"Bought this as a gift for a friend...she already had it, so I read it -- very interesting and well written!"
3,Um...,"I've never read this book, and it sounds a bit like a hippy book to me, but Our Lady Peace wrote a song about it and, in that respect, it's good. OLP forever!"
4,go Cher!,"Cher is at her best! The music is no good without you! The import of her latest CD is better than the one stateside. The song ""you take it all"" is hauntingly beautiful. Excellent!"
4,Scary,"A rather sobering look at gender politics in Japanese corporations. Really interesting, bizarre and complex. I read this after I had been already living in Japan for a number of years but wish I had read it earlier. Anyone studying gender relations or corporate practices in Japan would do well to read it. Anyone wanting to work in a Japanese office would NEED to read it."
3,Too small for my taste,"This pepper mill grinds adequately, but is much smaller than I thought it would be. I would purchase a larger pepper mill if I had it to do over again."
1,she is the one¡¡¡¡,"Hi friends: shakira is on top now¡, she is a great singer and now, she is singing in english, this song is great and I enjoy it everytime I hear this cd.bueno, realmente siento nostalgia de cuando cantaba en español paero tambien esta muy bien+saludos shakira¡¡¡¡¡¡Suerte¡¡¡¡"
2,Helmet size not consistent with retail store items,"We purchased this item online because of the shipping offer we had received when ordering the bike along with the helmet set. We were disappointed when we received the helmet and even though it stated the size was Toddler 3T, it was much smaller than the Toddler 3T one, also Disney, that was sold at our local Wal-Mart. Needless to say, we would lose about $8.00 by returning the item--half of what we paid for it. Just a little frustrated. Guess we'll give it as a gift."
5,No problems yet.,This set is great since this was purchased for my nephew who is learning to ride bike. No bruises or scrapes yet. He looks like a professional riding bike.
3,forgettable,"Nothing special, nothing horrible, just pretty forgettable.The heroine disguises herself as a boy (I despise this standard historical romance plot!) so she and her brother can fulfill their recently deceased father's dream of going to California.She's a bit TSTL (too stupid to live), in that she refuses to listen to advice.There's a bit of a love triangle. The hero's got a guilt complex.Then there's some minor drama with Indians and a near-mutiny, but all the conflicts are resolved way too easily."
2,bot chairs,"Mixed review - I ordered burgundy but received black. Funny, because I really preferred black but that was not an option when I ordered! For the price you get your moeny's worth, I guess, but don't even bother putting the wheels on. I bot 4 chairs and all the wheels were broken in 3 weeks. No abuse either. I like Target and expect they will make amends."
4,Definitely pink!,"Has a great bold color, more of a hot pink than pastel pink. Does a good job with odor control and the rats love moving it around and making a hill in the doorway to their house. I still choose to clean the dirty spots with a litter scooper once a day."
3,Maze book,"I bought this book for my Grand Daughter (age 4 years old). This book is a bit over her head. But will enjoy it later, if it doesn't get lost. Would recommend this book for 5 and up."
5,Really.... There are simple solutions!,"This book was a wonderful read! A nice combination of light,easy and yet thought-provoking. ""Clueless"" applies to all of us at various times and to various degrees. My goal was to improve a long-term relationship and this book adds insight for me. It's a genuine reminder that I cannot expect my partner to be a mind-reader and that so many ""solutions"" can be basic/simple and accomplished with clearer communication. This is one book I'll keep to re-read next year."
3,for smaller dogs,"From the description, thought it would be for all animals. It's pretty small and should state that it is for cats and SMALL dogs. I'll keep it as an extra but not really for medium to large dogs at all"
2,"Great actors, not so great movie",Strange and more about the crazy obsessed girl than the actual story. Frames a guy for killing her neighbor's wife so that she can get his attention. Too many nude scenes between her and the crazy guy. Just weird.
5,All Factors GO,"I'll make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works. First and foremost: it works and works well. It may be only be 3 feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as I need it. If I were lucid when I measured the location I would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what I needed at the time and now the length is perfect. I have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but NOT this Belkin. It is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient. Those elements alone would be worth buying this cable; however, when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it under any circumstances that work."
2,Way too short to be of any use whatsoever.,"It functions, but it way too short to be functional. I bought it because I thought the color was cute and I didn't think too much beyond that."
2,Snubbed!,"The item says ""3-Foot"" but it more looks like 3 inches! I don't know if that's a typo or what but I want my money back!"
3,Good quality but shorter than 3 feet,"The cable is only 3 feet long if you measure from the tip of the connector to the tip of the other connect - i.e., the cable itself is NOT 3 feet long - it's <34"" and you really have to stretch it to get that). It just works for the use I had intended. I would recommend ordering a 6 foot and then using cable ties if it's too long unless you only need 2 feet of cable as you really don't want it that taut."
3,too short cable,"I bought this cable 2 weeks ago, and it's works perfectly, but the only problem is that: TOO SHORT! I can use it only a few places."
3,"Ok, but length is deceiving.","Ok, I haven't measured these chords, and they do what they are meant to do but I don't think they are 3 foot long because I had to rearrange my entire network because these chords weren't close to 3 foot long."
1,the specifications are not clear on the site. dimensions are not clear.,the specifications are not clear on the site. dimensions are not clear and the products received are different from photos on the site.
5,Works fine,"Does what I need it to, which is primarily to be a quick disconnect between a coupler and my PC when I don'twant to be online."
4,very dependable,cable you can depend on very usable easy to connect where ever you want right size will not interfere with any other item.
4,they seem to work,"No speed test done, but work for both video games and Netflix, which is why I bought them. Easy to use and packaged as promised."
3,Misadvertised,"Product wasn't as shown in the thumbnail. The connectors were hand snipped, not factory ones, does a descent job though, 3 out of 5 since it wasn't the product I was expecting."
5,Couldn't have made a better choice.,"Bought it for a real cheap price. It is working great with the Cisco Wireless router I bought, and I'm very satisfied with it. Need to buy a cable? Think no more, you're at the right place. Just go for it :)"
4,3' Cat5e,Great product! Don't spend a lot of money. High quality. It arrived earlier than expected. I would definatly order again if I needed more.
5,Belkin cat cable,This produce is well made is from a good company and works as stated very well. This item came in a very short timne and was all I had expected
4,Nice,Very nice love the color option as it Maude's life easy & you can see which wire is for what.worked for me .pretty too
5,Molded Patch Cable,"Did not care about the color that didn't matter. I needed a patch cable for my WII to connect to my television. Why not give it a high rating especially when it is so easy to open and connect to the source(s), and it works just fine."
5,jplugging along,still working - and the price was alright - what more can you ask from a cable after all eh
2,unneeded,I really didn't need this short cable. The seven foot one worked out for me. Thank you anyway. Yours truly.
4,not long enough?,"I have not measured it with a scale, but it doe snot look like a 3 feet long cord to me."
5,Great book!,"Sonar 2.0 is such a complicated program. I haven't even messed with many of the features, including MIDI, but have gotten quite good at audio editing. This book made a huge difference. I found it much clearer and easier to follow than the online help or manual that came with Sonar. Highly recommended!"
1,uniflated air mattress,I bought two of these mattress one leaked so much that I could not blow it up.I made it to the pool with the other one. within one hour it was limp with very little air. Junk from china.
4,Good for the kids,"We bought this for the kids, I mean it's obvious from the description that it's not really going to be great for adults. It is just fine for them. The valves are awful...hard to get blown up (the thing you need to squeeze doesn't really open the hole enough) and then they have a tendency to unplug themselves, which, of course, means you need to blow them up again. But, the kids love them and it keeps them away from the more expensive floats that the adults use...you know, the kind that hold your drinks!"
1,Air mattress leaks.,I bought three mattresses. Two of them will not hold air overnight. These are brand new. The quality needs to be improved.
1,I wasted my money,"They are very small. If you are under 5 feet tall and don't mind that the pillow does not inflate indepently of the raft. So, if ya spring a leak you don't have any floatation, hope ya can swim. To add to it. They are very narrow as well. The ad should say for children or adults under 5 ft. Maybe it was mark incorrect"
4,Very Cute Lunchbox,"My son and I picked this out for my daughter to use as a dollbaby suitcase. It arrived quickly from the vendor and is just as adorable in person. I'd have given it five stars, but I don't think it's a deep as the lunchboxes of my day. I was hoping itwould hold more doll clothes."
5,Fits 99-01 XJ Nice and Heavy Duty got rid of wheel wobble.,"I ordered all new shocks from Rancho and forgot about the steering stabilizer so I got this to have a full Rancho suspension. Rancho said this would fit and it does and it works beautifully ignore t Amazon's parts match, bolted right up took about half hour only hard part was lining it up perfectly if you don't own a lift. My XJ does not shake the wheel at all going 55+. Ontop of everything Amazon had the cheapest price with free shipping."
3,Run Small IMHO,They are ok and get the job done...no leaks so far...the only complaint really is that they run pretty small in my humble opinion...a size 6 pampers or huggies is WAY BIGGER then Drypers size 6. I would say the size 6 dryper is roughly the same as a size 4 Pampers Cruiser.
1,"If you like PKD, Do Not Read this book","Although the author's heart is in the right place, the book is sorely disappointing. Bishop captures none of the depth, anxiety, or mental displacement common to a Dick novel. Even Dick's characters, who aren't often noted for psychological breadth are superior to the ones in this book. I wanted to like this book, I really did, but it's failure really makes clear how unique an author PKD really was."
4,Good but still somehow lacking,"This book is defenately worth reading but I do feel the need to write a slightly more critical review. Having read a lot of Dick's work this by comparison is disturbingly sane. I understand Michael Bishop was not trying to emulate, Dick, but, in that case, I would have liked to have seen something a little more original, something that explored and pushed the boundries of the way we see the world. Dick had a way of writing things that would toy with the reader and provoke them, of building up to something with logical and intelligent insite and then going right off the deep end. I miss that."
4,Is PKD really dead?,"Somewhere somewhen PKD is morphing into Michael Bishop, classical music rolling into words on the keyboard. If you've read all of PKD's works and are jones-ing for more, check this out. And as our media crazed society increasingly resembles one of PKD's novels, don't we need all the help we can get?"
2,Not very impressed..,"I don't like to write negative reviews much, but when I saw this album rated 4.5 stars on average I felt the need to at least express my opinion. This album sounds uninspired to me and lacks the energy of their earlier sound. Maybe you could call this a moment when a band ""matures"". Personally when I want to listen to HLATN I'll stick with the less mature.."
4,A Different direction for HLN,"This cd is not bad, but it is not great. This cd was a diffferent direction for the band. Some songs are wonderful, I enjoy ''Perfect World'', and ''World to me'', and ''Slammin'' . Although, It was good to see the band went back to their style for the next few cd's, this cd isnt bad. It is a must have for a HLN fan, but if you are beginning your collection, get ''Time Flies', or ''Four Chords..'', and then add this one later."
4,Ronnie Was and Remains Great!,"This particular album is a wonderful stroll down memory lane. Milsap's voice was so smooth, so strong and so recognizable. His arrangements are beautifully done. For lovers of pop, soft rock,country, or just Ronnie Milsap fans, this is a wonderful purchase and makes a great gift."
3,Obsolete Or Not?,"I don't have it..but I do own all the tracks that are on here. They can be found on Ultimate Ronnie Milsap. This is that, minus Am I Losing You, He Got You, Don't You Know How Much I Love You, Still Losing You, In Love, and Make No Mistake, She's Mine. This is part of a series of 16 Biggest Hits; otherwise, it's virtually obsolete. Buy only if you want the biggest collection of Ronnie Milsap merchandise in the world. Otherwise, pass this one on by and pick up Ultimate instead."
3,nostalgic,"-remembering ""the old days."" Some of those old songs really tell it like it is! Ronnie represents a side of life many people will resonate with."
1,Find about Descartes somewhere else,"Don't waste your money; go to Wikipedia instead. You'll get better and more objective information about Descartes there. The author takes a very subjective position and not only presents aspects of Descartes life, (and not so much his ideas), but also takes every opportunity to disparage and criticize other thinkers. Some times is even laughable.I'm not sure what point he was trying to make but he mentions and celebrates the fact that Descartes used to get up at noon at least ten times during the pamphlet."
5,cherry ames books,Product was in great shape and packaged very securely. Thanks for the great service.
3,Fun but repetitive,I love the music but this sounds like a 5 minute asalto on repeat. Well done but kind of exhausing…overpriced.
1,Don't waste your time,"Like others have said, this book is awful. Plain and simple. Unorganized, laughable at best index, terrible examples, and the list goes on and on. Wouldn't even get it if it was a required text for class, unless of course you have assigned homework problems from the book. The authors should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Dazed and Confused...,"I am currently a Masters level student who is taking a Governmental Accounting course. I have found this text to be somewhat confusing. The chapters and the information are very detailed however, the study questions introduce new terms and are hard to follow. This makes for a complicated and frustrating process for anyone who has not had a previous accounting course. I understand that there are not many books out there on this topic. However, a study guide or even the assistance of a glossary and some consistency in phrasing questions to be similar to the text would help. If I can't understand what the question is asking how am I to know if I understand what I thought I just read. The lack of pictures and graphics does not bother me and the blue ink while hard to get used to is easier on my eyes. The Powerpoint presentations were also helpful."
1,Certainly not the book to use,"In general, this is the worst accounting book I have EVER been forced to decipher (didn't like our cost accounting book either). At my school, and probably elsewhere, ,everybody seems to think Acct 405 (Financial Acct 2) is the ""hard"" course, but Fin Acct 2, at least to me, has NOTHING on trying to learn governmental accounting from using this awful book."
3,Difficult to fit,I found this difficult to get on the seat. It doesn't fit as tight as I would have liked and I had to modify it to make the DVD player fit on the back of the seat.
2,Not the best,The seatcovers do not really fit as advertized. They do not fit properly over bucket seats with a head rest and are much too big without the head rest. One of the seat covers had a small flaw on it when it came out of the box.
4,Not for Vans,This Item is great cause its Tinkerbell but when I bought it they said it was for cars and vans it did not fit my van seat.
1,Don't waste your money,"Although these seat covers are cute, they ripped at the seam where the back and seat meet within a week. Wasted my money on this purchase."
3,cute seat cover,I loved this product when I got it. It didn't last tat long. Within a few months it ripped on me. The material is very thin.
3,Tinkerbell seat covers,"These were OK. I bought them for my daughter. She has a newer Beetle. I had to customize them to make them work with the head rest and lever to move the seat forward. It's a good thing it comes with extra plastic hooks because several broke trying to connect the elastic to the grommets. One of the elastic straps broke. Even with all that, I got them to fit OK. I don't expect them to last long. The foam lining inside started tearing when we were putting them on."
2,seat covers,I ORDERED THE TINKERBELL CAR SEAT COVERS. I HAVE HAD THEM JUST A WEEK OR SO AND THEY ARE ALREADY COMING APART. I AM GOING TO SEND THEM BACK. ALSO ORDERED THE STEERING COVER WHICH LOOKS WORN AND USED. ALSO FLOOR MATS.THANK YOUMRS EYLER
3,"Tinker Bell ""Off To Never Neverland"" Universal-Fit Bucket Seat Cover","I was really happy with the quality of these seat covers. BUT where it states that they are ""Universal-Fit"" that is where I was totally let down! I tried and tried to get the seatcovers on my seats but they would not fit! No matter how hard I tried there was about 2 inches of the seat back that they would not cover. Because of this then the seat part was partially on the seat back and would not attach to the seat correctly."
3,nice design but,I was giving these seatcovers for Christmas and after only having them in my car for 3 weeks where the seam for the back and the seat are put together it is starting to run like a pair of pantyhose would.
2,Very very boring,"I read this book because of One Book Arizona's sponsorship. It was boring beyond words, and I can't imagine why it won the One Book award. The people who voted must have been students of the author because this was not a good book."
1,bleah,"Vedere Stallone recitare può anche essere un'esperienza divertente, ma purtroppo capita raramente nei suoi film e questo non fa eccezione. L'inizio è da cardiopalmo: Stallone che cerca di salvare la sciacquetta inesperta mette i brividi, ma lei precipita giù e con lei tutto il film. Poteva anche finire lì, purtroppo il film continua. Pazienza."
1,dvd not received - see review box,"my order was placed for this dvd ( Cliffhanger [DVD] (1997) Harlin, Renny; Stallone, Sylvester; Lithgow, John...Sold by: ctburesch) on 13 april 2002 - but never received. all feedback was just ignored. what happens with sellers like this ??thxandre"
3,many mistakes,"A somewhat corny, but good action packed thriller. There are many problems and mistakes in the movie to. Mainly in the begining sequence before the women has a problem. 1> You would never rely on one peton as a peace of transport equipment. 2> If the clip of her harness broke it would not release her. Her leg loops would still be on and she could easly recover. 3> When Stalone went to rescue her, as he reached for her with one hand the other had was holding his entire body weight up. (there was no weight on the pully or the carabiner. He should of just let go of the wire and reached for her with both hands. 4> When the man says the cable is not rigged for two people, that is only because of the damn peton. The cable is 7 gauge and could hold over 25Kn about 5620 lbs. and the helicopter could hold twice that much. 5> There is no such thing as a bolt gun."
3,Why? Ehh...,"I really wanted to like this movie. I rock climb, and I love Stallone movies, but I gotta know if anyone else thought the overuse of the F-word got obnoxious. For the first thirty minutes or so I was like, ""OK whatever, the word does sound pretty hard core I guess."" An hour later when they were still throwing it around like tomatoes at the La Tomatina festival, I wanted to turn it off and didn't for the sake of seeing how it ended. The action is GREAT! My only complaint is with the F-bombs. Oh, and the pitiful acting done by the ""Third Rock from the Sun"" guy. I liked him too. Man. That was really poor casting."
3,No DVD menu available,Picture quality good but the case advertises 5.1 sound and only delivers Pro-logic. My copy would not locate any DVD menu. The disc offers two viewing formats (one on each side of the disc.)
3,CLIFF HANGER,"A VERY GOOD MOVIE DESPITE SOME DRAWBACKS. STALLONE CAN'T ACT, AND LOOKS WORSE WITH AN OTHERWISE GOOD CAST. SOME OF THE SETS LOOKED FAKEY."
4,Good movie for a rainy day,"I enjoy this movie, it's not too bright scenario but is enough as entertainment.Beautiful breathtaking views of the mountains!"
1,Boring Flick with ONE Good Part,"This movie bored the devil out of me; it's nothing special - same old stunts, same archetypical bad guy, same narrow escapes, blah, blah,blah.. There was, however, one good part - good because it was so laughable. In the beginning scene, when Stallone's character is trying to save the girl who falls, Stallone's helicopter pilot is LAUGHING. It's true! I think the actor is supposed to be showing concern or fright, but he's not - he is LAUGHING! If you don't believe me, check it out. It's highly laughable!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A preposterous movie about people in teeshirts climbing up and down snowy mountains with a cardboard-cutout performance by Stallone in the lead and a generic villain, Cliffhanger does not deserve to be watched, owned, or recommended."
2,"good beginning, bad rest of the way","this movie started off really well. i love the beginning part, and was fixed on the screen as the tragedy happened on the cliffside at the beginning of the movie. but from there on, i actually lost interest. they made the first part of the film too good, so that the rest seemed paltry."
1,incredibly stupid at many levels,"i honestly cannot understand how anyone could have found this flick entertaining. i was told to watch it for the climbing scenes--from a technical standpoint they were laughable (excepting the opening few seconds). the story line was moronic. apart from a (very) few nice scenics, this was a bad joke and complete waste of time. i haven't bothered to watch a stallone flick since."
2,"A few good action scenes, but predictable, with terrible acting.","I recorded it from TV, and it took 3 evenings to get through it. John Lithgow, a good actor, came acrossas a caricature of a bad guy, with a terrible fake English accent. The other actors did their best, but it was predictable - you knew it would end with the fight between Stallone and Lithgow. Some good action scenes, and nice scenery. I'd say rent it if you absolutely must see it. I'm happy that I have now erased it."
4,It is a Sylvester Stallone's show.,"Sylvester Stallone turned upside down did show aging effect on his body.Yet, his meticulous touches in face actions were still near perfecto. Bravo, if Sylvester Stallone could still do one movie like that, the audience will be lucky.Without Sylvester Stallone to be there, the show might be only worth watching for the fall of Sarah and the concentrated focus of Jessica in rescuing. But even those, anybody can do the work.Sylvester Stallone chose a tough career. Acting is a fun but difficult living. This actor must love acting. The real sense of relieving from acting is again viewed in his final note where he held Jessica but showing all the signs ready to move on to either the reality of the life or to another acting role."
3,"AVERAGE STALLONE, BUT GOOD ACTION","There are great action sequences, but one reviewer below showed the great ammount of technical mistakes made in the opener sequence. (the girl hanging above the abyss) Anyway, there is good action and some unecessarily violent deaths (the bad guys, of course, have always the most violent deaths). Stallone tried to revocer from failured comedies, and this was a good start."
4,One of Stallone's best movies.,"Cliffhanger came out in 1993 after a series of flops that filled Stallone's career. This was generally well recieved by critics, and grossed a good 84 million in the United States. The movie was nominated for about six Razzie Awards, which I think it doesn't deserve, because this movie was great from beginning to end. John Lithgow played a great villian, who was cold, and sadistic. Rex Linn was very good as Travis, and so was Ralph White, except for that part at the beginning where he was laughing as the girl was falling. Overall, a good solid sction movie"
3,Not bad at all,"This is a good movie, it should be 3 and a half stars, I'm giving only 3 cos even though is good ,it's not one of those movies you want to watch twice, watch it once it's enough,"
4,The Swan has got to be one of the most haunting pieces of music ever created,"All I can tell you is I love The Swan. Haunting, hipnotic, melancholy.Soprano Kiri Te Kanawa's aria (from Bachiana brasileiras No. 5 for Soprano and Cellos) makes you take pause and listen. Woman is absolutely incredible.Nice collection all around. (Would have given the CD five stars, if not for volume inconsistancy: up during certain numbers, down during others.) Not the fault of the performers, of course...still..."
4,funtimes,"the price was so inexpensive, I was worried about the quality. It was outstanding! had the glass dome engraved at a local engraver to personalize. they had no problem doing so, due to the higher quality of the glass used. It was absolutely beautiful."
5,Pure heaven,"I was sitting in traffic flipping stations when I heard a song I'd never heard before.. it was smooth and perfect. Blues at its sweetest. ""Down in Mississippi"" stayed with me for a long time after. I knew I had to have a copy. When I heard the rest of the album I was blown away. Take classic Mississippi Delta blues and mix in a generous gospel quality and you get one of the finest albums I've ever heard. If you're new to either style, I recommend starting here. You will not be disappointed. Close your eyes, sit back and listen and you can almost feel yourself being transported back to the Deep South. Lose yourself in what music should be."
5,Timeless Songs & Quality Sound,"One of the best gospel recordings ever made, Pop Staples worked with the best in the business to give us a polished gem of a masterpiece. Some of the songs, such as This May Be The Last Time, have been on previous Staple Singers albums but here they get a contemporary treatment. Guest artists include Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Brown, and Ry Cooder. Mavis, Yvonne and Cleotha Staples join him, with Mavis taking lead on Pray On My Child. Some may find the album sounds uneven with five different production teams, but I enjoyed the styles that each brought the recording. For example, Ry Cooder brings a pared-down rootsy sound to the production of the delta blues material that reminds us of where the music came from, on songs such as Down In Mississippi, and I Shall Not Be Moved. Willie Mitchell brings in Jackson & Love of the Memphis Horns for a more urban sound on America. Get it!"
4,Great Price for this item!!!!!!,First let me say that this item comes with software for playing DVD's and making music CD's and data CD's. It has a very compact design which makes it very easy to fit in laptop bags. It does not need the power cord that comes with it because it is powerd by the USB port which is a great idea. It has buffer under run technology which helps in the process of CD burning. I would recommend this item for anyone.
5,Amazing!,"This is such a talented band. They just recently came to my town two weeks ago, and that was the first time I had seen them live. I was blown away. Now I am super pumped to see them at Suawanne Springfest this year!!!"
2,Boring Blueray title,I thought it was entertaining .. But it was so boring that I stopped halfway through .. They might have made best representation of the show in Blue ray .. But enetertainment value is 0 for me.
4,"Broadway ""Rent""","""Rent"" is a fantastic show, however, we were disappointed that this one did not star two of the original cast: Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp. The filming would have been better without closeups and seen more as an audience member would have viewed it. It is still a great show to see and the music is incredible. We really enjoyed the bonus features!"
3,Only for diehard Rent fans,Didn't really like the cast of the final show. It's not bad but but the movie is better.
1,Disastrous Production,"Wow. There are many many instances where performers heads are CUT OFF (while they're singing) and you only see them from the neck down.If this was in fact the final performance of Rent, the producers missed their chance to capture fully capture it.I""m not sure whether they were trying to be edgy or hired an amateur camera crew, but I'd guess it's the latter."
2,Clone,"Every time I see this show, it is just a cloned version of the original cast. I liked the original cast, but once you change casts the actors should be able to make the part their own. This seems like a bunch of Rentards who spent their high school years working for this part, practicing it the same way they heard it on CD or saw it on the stage. Theatre is supposed to grow and change. This doesn't further the idea that Rent was when it first came out... so sad it closed last year.Sorry to offend any Rent fans, but that's how I feel."
5,An Essential for any Rent-head,"If you love Rent, then this video is something you must have. To be able to see the stage show anytime you want, is so incredible. As much as I love the original cast, this final closing cast is right on their heels. It is the perfect tribute to Jonathan's legacy."
5,Fabulous!!!,"I love Rent. Until now I had to satisfy my love of with the motion picture, which while okay is just not the same as Rent on Broadway. This is an excellent production in the actual theater. The only sad part is that this is the last performance."
5,The perfect tribute to Mr. Larson!,"I sow it twice in a row and both times I could not hold the tears, thank you guys for this breathtaking performance, thank you Jonathan for giving to the world this piece of pure love."
3,"Great companion, but not a replacement...go see the show live first...","The filmed stage rendition is a great companion to those who have already seen and experienced the show. If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend seeing it live first. One of the things that was kind of bitter-sweet for me was the filmed close-ups. While the close-ups were perfectly timed, I felt that it took away from the general choreography and viewers will miss a few subtleties that happen in the background. It just felt like something was missing...almost like watching a movie in full-screen mode. You know something is going on, but it's cutoff.What would have been great is if they allowed users to choose alternate angles...which they could have easily incorporated, but just didn't.Anyways, still a great production... If you haven't seen it, I don't think you'll get the same appreciation from just watching the dvd. Again, a great companion to seeing it live, but definitely no replacement."
4,"Wonderful show, one drawback","Finally, what RENTheads have long been waiting for. A filmed production of Rent. This is as close to the stage production you're going to get without actually being in a theater. My only complaint is that I'm not too fond of the way Mimi comes off. Rather than the fun, flirtatious, rough-around-the-edges Mimi I have come to know and love, this Mimi appears often angry with a voice that is almost too polished for the part. The rest of the cast is stellar. Despite my views on Mimi, I can't wait to own this disc!VIVA LA VIE BOHEME!"
5,I am completely blown away!,This dvd is AWESOME! I love it and Will Chase and Adam Kantor make the best Mark and Roger. Their acting is superb along with the rest of the cast. This was the first time I have seen the show and after watching this video I bought tickets to fly away and see it live on the Broadway tour. I have to say I was blown away by this dvd but who stood out for me the most right from the beginning was Will Chase. This guy can act like no one's business.WOW!
5,Measure your life in love,Great musical: a MUST see for everyone! This version is the best out there. Much better than the movie (which is quite good but not as much as the theatre representation)
4,Great Extras,Bought this for a birthday gift and she LOVES it! It's the next best thing to being there plus there are some great bonus features
2,buy the movie,I am a fan of Rent and have seen it on Broadway and own the movie. Filming a live show is tricky and this version filmed live on Broadway falls short of a pleasurable experience for the true devotee such as myself. The editing is choppy and it has such a flat feel throughout. The singers/actors are adequate on this DVD however it lacks the polish that it should be afforded. I would just buy the DVD of the movie.
4,Great movie-great show!,"Absolutely loved that they filmed the last performance! I only wished at the end that they would have identified the stars' names as well as their roles. I knew some of them, but not all of them. Still, a great idea and a wonderful performance!"
5,absolute genius,"this is in CONSTANT rotation in my computer, ipod, brain, etc. and has been for quite some time now.by far their most cohesive, catchy and accessible effort to date.they've just changed their name to super/system becasue some completely terrible budweiser promoted band called el guapo got all angry when they realized good music was being made in their name by sincere artists. such is life.there's not a song i don't like here.it's brilliant.ps: go see a show if you can! they play all the time!"
4,Strong musical presence,"I understand why this band has a following in Europe and in the US. I originally bought this CD because one of the musicians' mother is a friend of mine, put it in the player so that I could say I listened, and was hooked on El Guapo's music. Maybe the recommendation of a mom may not persuade anyone, but I will also tell you I passed it on to my teenage son and his friends, and they liked it too. I think the music is stronger than the lyrics, but I like the whole package. Try their earlier offerings, as well."
3,The Rattle Bag,"This great poetry book is out of print but you can still order used copies. This is the second copy of ""The Rattle Bag"" I've ordered. I wanted a second copy so that I could send it to a friend and share the wonderful poetry in this collection. The latest order has a different cover - not important - but the print is crooked and slopes on the page. The page numbers appear to be the same, though, so we can still share poetry by referencing just the page numbers in our emails."
3,Not What I Expected,"I'd hoped for an eclectic selection of late 20th century poetry like Garrion Keeler's Good Poems. I found many poems I already had in other anthologies in this collection. But more than that, the poetry just didn't move me--too masculine perhaps. I wonder."
2,glass engraving pattern book by john everett,"this is a pattern book, with all paterns protected by copyright. how is ist possible to copyright the works of artists that lived from 500 to 2500 years ago, as well as traditional celtic patterns.some of the patterns are big globs of black ink, that can't be copied.the author does not even know nor adhere to the most basic principle of glass engraving:""engraved lines are white, unengraved polished glass is black"".there are some interesting paterns, if we would be allowed to use them, a pattern that we are not allowed to copy is no longer a pattern."
3,5 Star Product - 1 Star HP Support = 3 Star Average,"Great PC, but heaven help you if you need any support. I was transfered 13 times trying to reach the right department. I think they were trying to make me talk to everyone in India. If you want to take the risk of having no issues - It is an awesome PC for the price. I feel for you if you have to call them. I am a PC Tech and they wasted 2 hours of my life and did NOT solve the problem when I did reach the right dept. Hope this helps."
2,Problem- Is it HP or Vista,I purchased this computer several months ago. While I have enjoyed the computer so far I have never had a computer lock up and crash so often. I am not at all impressed with Vista and would not get Vista again if I had a choice. The hard drive seems to run way more then any other computer I have had. Sometimes when I run defrag it defrags in about an hour then the next time its a day later it's still trying to defrag and you have to hard boot the system. While I have had several HP computers not sure I would buy this one with Vista again until the bugs are out. Oh and by the way trying to get HP Tech support is next to impossible and when you do they don't seem to have a clue!
3,Not that bad...,"This movie is good if you're a Florida history nut of some type but it is not perfect and has several obvious flaws. Still, if you're a Florida buff, why not? It does have some good parts to it. Worth the price but barely..."
1,Saw the Documentary..,"Saw this documentary, it is poorly researched and slanted towards the filmmaker's own opinion, not fact. Quotes such notables as ""The Nation"" and other slanted views, has good archival images and footage, but overall not recommended for a School project or class nor for The average person who can't separate fact from fiction. If you enjoy Michael Moore and the Gore, and the sky is falling categories or simply looking to be indoctrinated with biased fiction not facts, perhaps this is for you. I would recommend renting it from the library or seeing for free since youtube has it there for free which is where I saw it. As a Floridian I found this film had nothing important or positive to say and it repeats itself over and over about things anybody would have known already and things that are made up. Look elsewhere for History."
5,Incredible treatment of the subject.,"I didn't know there was so much to learn about printing digital files. You just select the file you want to print, choose Print from the File menu, and go, right? Wrong-O! I never suspected that I'd find so much to apply to my own work in this book. I'm glad I was smart enough to check it out, see what it had to offer, and then add it to my collection."
5,The most comprehensive approach,"It's a printing classic in the world of digital arts. Mastering Digital Printing is useful for all levels of users and in spite of its technical approach, the book is written in a simple, attractive language making it interesting to read and understand. It is supported with the beautiful pictures helping user to get thorough with the subject. Truly the great road map towards digital printing."
2,The One Book for Epsonians based in US,"The author forgot to mention in the foreword that the world is composed only of Americans using Epson printers, I am afraid.Should I live in US, I would award the book the usual five stars, on the other hand. But - if you are not a US citizen and, worse yet, believe that there are other printer brands than Epson, you have been warned."
5,Informative & Engaging,"This book does a teriffic job of making a complex subject easy to understand without ""dummying down"" the content. Very well written with excellent illustrations. Best text I have found on the subject."
2,Not what you'd expect,"With a title including the word ""mastering"" I expected a little more than a basic overview of the subject. The first part of the book is a history lesson talking about Graham Nash being the first one to do high-end digital printing for the art world. It includes numerous plugs for Nash's Nash Editions printing company as well as other related companies. The second park talks about the various equipment available for digital printing, both high end, and at home. Again, a great history lesson (most equipment is outdated already) but you can learn more by window-shopping at a local electronics store. With a title like Mastering Digital Printing, I expected more info on color calibration, setting up images for output, etc., and less of a history lesson. If they re-titled the book to actually reflect the contents, and cut the price in half, this would be a great book at an acceptable price."
3,Aged commentary still somewhat useful,"This book is getting mighty long in the tooth. It addresses inkjet printers from long before they became so good and useful. The approach to CMS, or color management systems, is superficial, and does not even address tools available when the book was written. It completely skips color spaces and the understanding of light and color.However, it does give a broad beginning approach to understanding color printing. If you are just beginning to learn, this book is a good introduction covering many of the topics you will need an introduction to. Once past the introductory phase of learning, this book is of little value, being to basic in its handling of subjects to really be useful."
2,Hardly Mastering!!,I agree with the other reviewer who describes this book as only an overview. If you knew nothing about printing before buying this book then you'd have more information than you started with. If you started with some printing skills and a basic understanding of industry terminology then you'd learn little more than a little bit of historyThere is also a MAJOR emphasis placed on providing information about Epson printers. This obvious bias makes the book come across as a blatant advertisement that only occasionally mentions other printers. This book contained so much advertising that I feel that it could be reduced in size and be passed out for free at all Epson dealers.
5,For all photo printer users,This book will help any digital photographer/printer to learn about printing phtographs.
2,got the t603 and not the T605,"Ordered the t605, and got t603 in the mail. Fulfilled by amzaon sold by shopcell. Very frustrating as I already took apart the stereo and started connecting it before i noticed it was the wrong item. Looks similar but the t603 doesnt support music, and doesnt have an aux or audio cables. Returned to amazon."
1,Don't bother unless you have an RCA jack,"I bought this for my car. The installation person told me I could connect it to my factory radio and it would be no problem. Once I got there, he told me I didn't have an RCA jack on the back of my radio, so I would have to use the Motorola speaker. Who wants to listen to high quality music on a cheap speaker? I wanted it to play through my car radio speakers. Don't think you are going to seamlessly install this in your car unless you have an RCA jack or you are planning to use the factory speaker. Needless to say, I returned mine and will not buy it again."
1,NOT A T605!!!,"I saw some of the other reviews that said it was a T603 instead of a T605 but also saw that some had gotten the T605 and took a chance. I received a T603 which does not do audio streaming. It was sold by ""Direct to Store"" and fulfilled by Amazon. It was in a plain white box with bot a T603 and T605 label and the unit was clearly marked T603. I was disappointed but Amazon is giving me a full refund. Seller then increased the price on the T605... Just a bit of inconvenience. Be warned."
2,Motorola 1,"This product has thus far been a disappointment. No where in the advertisement for this product is there information stating that for most car models to install this to work with your sound system you will need to purchase additional cables. Motorola was no help at finding this information, they stated that it can only be installed by a professional. We were able to locate cables after many phone calls and research on the internet, but the cables cost more than the price of the unit. We are still waiting for the cables to arrive, so the unit has not been installed yet."
2,Disappointed,"They don't tell you that your ipod will not work unless you buy a D650 (bluetooth for your ipod). I spent $50 for the T605, $130 for the install and i still can't play my ipod. I called motorola and they told me I need a D650 (which costs $50). I might as well have bought an after market car stereo that does it all..."
4,2005 Honda Odessey,"Purchased two of these systems for my 2005 Honda and 2002 Saab. The Honda was a very simple install, but because of the premium speakers I can't integrate the system into my stero. The speaker it comes with is okay, but I wish I could get the sound through the car speakers. The product works great and I would recommend it to anyone, as we all should be responsible drivers and use hands free kits in our cars. As for the Saab, I need a special harness to use the kit so I can't really comment on it to date."
3,april fools,"I bought this item. it was really really hard to find someone to install it. the search for a harness for my 08 cobalt was nnerve racking. but once i finally got it installed it was awesome!!!! for about four months. there i was in the middle of a conversation and it stopped sending the signal, and never started again. i called motorola five times for support but they hung up on me. when i finally got through, they said they would switch it out for me, which surprised me because i bought it on amazon, but it would still triple the installation price because i would have to have it uninstalled, send it in, wait for it, get it back, and have it reinstalled again.i want it back, but i am not sure its worth it."
3,Average,I have read this book and others like it and for the money it really lacked the punch. If you are a business journalist like me you probably already have a host of books that cover this material.
2,Extremely dangerous words in chapter nine!!!!!,"I just want all parents out there to understand that while ""sexually experimenting with other boys"" (chapter nine) may be ""normal"", it can also easily be considered a CRIME for which your son can be prosecuted.BE CAREFUL WITH THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
1,Buyer BEWARE- XXX RATED,"This book is suggested for 10 year olds and yet is filled with PICTURES of female anatomy labeling the clitoris etc. Moreover, it discussed homosexuality, herpes, female pubic hair, abortion, tampons, sexual variation (BONDAGE WITH PICTURES), Internet Pornography etc. I thought this would be a good way to provide information to my children about their bodies but I am returning it immediately! We are open-minded progressive parents but this is just too much! It belongs in an adult bookstore not a kid's bedroom."
1,"Dangerous Words, Beware!","Chapter 8, titled: Is This Normal? States, ""it is not unusual for a boy to watch another boy masturbate or to masturbate with a group of boys. Nor is it unusual for two boys to masturbate each other."" My 13 year old son was accused of sexual assault by an 11 year old boy (a friend) after the 11 year old suggested they masturbated together, they did so on three occasions. The charge came a year later, social services and the police visited our home. Our younger son was almost removed from our home. Our 14 year old was questioned by police, charged, fingerprinted and we had to hire a lawyer. This book states that boys masturbating together or each other is not unusual. Maybe so, but it is a crime, and your child could be charged with sexual assault. Especially when the other child, out of guilt, fear, or revenge perhaps, tells his parents that he wasn't a willing participate once he realizes his ""young, boyish curiosity"" was a crime. BEWARE!"
3,how 'bout a book for 9-10 year olds !?,"Okay here's another example of a book giving too much info too early on! I leafed through the beginning of the book; ok, good-but- the remainder of this book is way too graphic for my 9 1/2 year old. I agree with kimc1616's review 100% I'm returning my copy!"
3,OKAY,"The book gives great information to boys who have alot of questions, myself am a single mom to a ten year old boy who had questions that I was not 100% sure of and this book helped me out. The only bad thing about this book is I Was not totally pleased with some of the language and how certain things were worded. Its a book I would rather myself read to him then him read by himself..."
1,Not for Younger Boys,"Unless you let your 10-11 year old watch R rated movies, your child is not ready for this book. Some of the pictures are too advanced for a younger child. Instead of starting off with the physicial changes of puberty, this book starts off Chapter 1 about sex and concentrates mainly on this subject. No easing into the subject here!"
2,not for the early tween,"This book has some great info...but ventures into places that I was not ready to go with my 5th grader....I was looking for a puberty ""starter"" book...but this delves deeper than I was ready to go...so it is tucked away for a few years....like high school."
2,"Almost a FIVE Star, but I'm returning it.","The book is everything the previous reviewers have said it is. Extremely well done. I really liked the way the subject manner was handled. Any kid would really enjoy reading and would understand what the authors were saying. However, since the book condones abortion and masturbation, and doesn't really promote abstinence and responsibility, I'm returning it. It was intended as a gift and I would not want it to reflect by views."
3,What's Going on Down There,My dad gave me this book to read and told me to do a book review on it. I only read up to chapter five becase I thought the rest of the chapters were useless. I think the book was good because it informs you that what you are going though is normal. It did do a good job of telling you about sex and I would suggest that kids my age should read it too.
3,Hmmm,"Informative, yet some things seemed to go beyond information and boarder on suggestion. Oh also there were quite a few type o' s. I'll let it marinate for a few days."
2,"It's okay, could be much better","The set looks good with the wooden flap and bright colors. A good adornment for your desk.The main problem with this item is that the darts do not stick on the board if you throw them hard. As the magnets are too small, the darts just bounce off the boards. You have to be very gentle in throwing the darts for the magnets to work.Many people who walk by my desk tried it and were unhappy about this since you can't really play much with it."
3,Perfect for my desktop furniture,"the product is perfect to have over the desktop to personalize a little bit your work space, also when you need those 5 minutes of distraction to unblock new ideas you can trow a couple of time and continue the work. It is not exactly a toy that I could give as a gif to my nephews, but I could used as a promotional gift between my clients."
3,Mini Dart Review,"Cute and tiny, this mini-dart set is perfect for the desktop! The magnets are durable and can withstand lots of throw action, and the wooden flip-up stand is a nice bonus! All in all, a very good desk toy..."
5,Lynn Truss is EXCELLENT!,My kids and I LOVE Lynn Truss- this was so funny and perfect! I just wish there was more available by her!Kristen
4,3rd Graders,"We ordered this book for my wife's third grade classroom, they seem to be enjoying it quite well along with the others in this series."
4,Truly about ethics on the Mountain,"I truly enjoyed reading Joe Simpson's book. Finally..you read about what one really see's on Everest and no hold's barred! If you want to know what one has to ""step over"" on the mountain..read this book..if you want to read about what one see's on the south col..then read this book...a great read!"
1,"Terrible, terrible excuse for a game.","No single player here at all. NONE. There is a training option, which is just some very very quick areas where as soon as you kill off the given enemies with the one or two given weapons the level ends abruptly. Also, these areas cannot be replayed once you successfully complete them. You must restart the training over from the first area. There's also no respawning on these training levels. They just start completely over.Also, do you really think anyone is playing this game online? Really? ummm.. nope they are not. I can't think of one reason to get this game. It's not even a real game in my opinion without at least a true single player. Groove made a wonderful game with Combat Task Force 121. I was really hoping this game would be as good, but it seems like Groove is turning out worse games for the pc now."
2,Defiantly not for your Off-Roading.,"Lets put this up-front. This is not for Off-Roading. It's for looks only.Now with that said, it uses Tape, and some screws on the underside to keep it on your Jeep (doesn't require drilling). Tapes used more commonly than you think when it comes to vehicles, and usually stays on without trouble for a very long time, if it ever comes off. But's for your road-bound cars. You're putting it on your Jeep, so if use it as a off-road vehicle as it was designed, don't expect it to stay on forever.As for a personal experience on my part. When I got the product, there was a thin tire mark on the package, and when I opened it, the product was bent. It was ran over by a forklift, then shipped to me. They replaced it, and I appreciate how quick it was. But in the end, I returned the product without installing it."
5,Fantastic!,What a nice product to strap a bottle of H2O to my son's stroller. No need to fumble around in the Diaper Bag anymore.
3,Nice book with reservations,"I bought this in anticipation of an upcoming visit to Charleston. It is a beautiful brochure more than a book. It does have what appears to be an outstanding selection of retaurants including sample menus ,gorgeous photos, directions and some recipes. I can't vouch for the recommendations yet but I will certainly try several of the featured places when I'm there. My hesitiation is for those who like me was looking for a guide to help select some eating places in Charleston. This may be a bit much under those circumstances and a zagat guide might suffice. However I reserve the right to review again when I return."
3,ernesto cardenal Bites the dust once again,"ive read this book in 1986 , this writings really show a kind of pscicodelic spiritual journey just like Castaneda that i would also recomend to anyone to adults and children ,, is like all this indian children stories dealing between the earth and the spirit world and making the medium thru life in a very significant way you wont forget."
2,Uses less compatible Broadcom chipset,"This device uses the less compatible Broadcom chipset. The Cambridge Silicone Radio (CSR) chipset is a better choice, but more difficult to locate."
3,klare Linien,"Dieses Buch ist im Grunde nur ein Technik-Katalog. Wer sich mit der Materie befasst wird nur dann einen Nutzen daraus ziehen können, wenn er erst am Anfang seiner Studien steht. Dann jedoch ist dieses Werk ein gutes Arbeitsmittel."
1,Awful texture!,"I purchased this because I wanted a healthy spaghetti and the write-up said it did not have a heavy, sticky consistency. I made half a bag and could not eat more than two bites. (And I'm on a diet so I was pretty darn hungry at that point.) The consistency was nothing like a normal spaghetti. It was thick and tough and doughy. Healthy...yes. Edible...not so much."
4,Good Tattoo - modern vs. traditional,"No problems with my DVD copy contrary to the other review on this product. Was enjoyable and will watch it again from time to time. Included commentary edited into the show to describe the participants. I can see how this ""modern"" tattoo might not please someone looking for the traditional one as many of the bands broke off into more modern, even jazz renditions of marching songs. But if you are looking for good entertainment in this vein, you should enjoy the 2010 show. The one bad note is that the picture quality suffered from time to time of lack of crisp focus. That would be the fault of the editing/production people and doesn't take a lot away from enjoying the music and atmosphere of a tattoo."
3,Faulty DVD,"The production on this DVD was great, but afaulty section in the disk prevented me from giving it a 'five star' rating. I sent an e-mail to the company but I did not receive an answer. Poor customer relationship."
1,DVD is defective,I needed the address for Celtic music so I can return the DVDThank you Karen Fico10945 Gary Player Dr..El PasoTX 79935kkfarf@swbell.net
2,Regret not buying a Honda,"I wish I had bought the comparable Honda. The only thing the McCulloch beats the Honda at is price. Quality, reliability, noise (especially noise) all go to the Honda."
1,McCulloch Inverter Generator,"I was looking to buy the Honda EU2000i, but after seening this on amazon and the money we save; it is not even a tough decision to make. This unit run quiet that other import generator. the only problem i have with this unit is the weight, it is portable, but the near 70 lbs weight make it difficult to carry around. the noise is ok at lower output, but getting close to 1500 watt, it become annoying. buying one of McCulloch vs spending $ 2000 for the honda. this is a lot better."
4,"Works, but is bulkier than the Apple charger","This will charge your Ipod without any problem. However as a travel charger it is much larger than the Apple charger, and the plug does not fold in. However it is less money, which is the main reason that I bought it. I mainly use it to charge my Ipod in the house when my laptop is not around, but for travel purposes I take the smaller Apple charger.Update 2/11/09: This does NOT work with the iPod Touch 2G."
1,Do not buy this.,This product is falsely advertised. It is said to work with any and all iPods but absolutely does not work for the iPod touch.
4,Very Satisfied Consumer,I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. It is exactly what I need for both at home and travel use. Quality is excellent.
5,Moon Palace spins the reader beyond expected bounds.,"Much has been made of the incredible coincidences that drive Moon Palace. However, they do not have to make sense. After all, it's fiction. The author can do as he pleases, and Auster does just that.All the familiar Auster themes are here in Moon Palace. The protagonist is often derailed into repetitive, dead-end subsistence, and could stay there indefinitely. Something usually comes along to push or guide him to a new route and destination, but life's new iteration too will ultimately be subverted.It's a constant effort in this book and others by Auster for the protagonist to remain true to his better (often higher, artistic) self. Yes Moon Palace, like other Auster novels, is auto-biographical. But striving for creativity and one's better self agaist the winds of chance and change is the critical mission in the lives of us all."
3,"Loved the beginning, but it fell apart in the last third","I LOVED the beginning of this book. I was captivated by the story of MS Fogg, and his existential life. I was interested in the middle of the book in hearing the story of Thomas Effing, the man Fogg goes to work for, and how Fogg is affected by this old man. However, the last third just lost it. I was reading along, and when I saw where it was heading I kept thinking: don't do it, don't do it--oh no! Auster did it. Then the whole story seemed contrived and obvious for me. It's too bad because it started with such potential.I'm not giving any plot points away because others seem to really love this book, so I won't give the spoilers that killed the book for me."
3,Wild tale.,"Moon Palace is a wild tale told by a narrator who lost his parents at an early age, and suffered psychological damage as a result. I had little sympathy or interest in this character, nor did I feel the novel really explores any of the philosophical issues that the narrator is interested in. Never-the-less, once you get through the narrator's college days, the tale is wild and original enough to make the novel worthwhile. It has an old fashioned feel which I enjoyed. It also has one of those endings which makes the entire novel more meaningful. Incidentally, if you are interested in wild tales by narrators who have lost their parents at an early age and suffered psychological damage as a result, may I recommend When We Were Orphans by Kazko Ishiguro, which is a more accomplished work. P.S.: review by Undine gives away the ending."
4,A melancholy masterpiece.,"Paul Auster's writing has the ability to linger long in the thought of his readers by virtue of its exquisite construction of sentences and rhythm. His plot inventions, such as the countless coincidences that happened to Fogg in this book (or those metaphysical characters in the New York Trilogy) are minor irritiation in an otherwise wry, melancholy and highly absorbing story. I could not put down the book even at three am in the morning before work. It will stay with you for a long time."
3,If this book was a pizza......,"At first we found the story very boring, but later it turned out to be very interesting. The novel had it's moments when it was exciting and funny, but still we think there is a general lack of humour. It's a novel filled with many weird coincidences, maybe too many. The jumping around in time makes the story very confusing and steals the excitement of the story. This also makes it longwinded to read but still there are many positive passages. The main character Marco is a very disturbed young man, who belives that his life is controlled by destiny. Our conclusion is that this story is intended for people who like to use their imagination for connecting details."
3,Coincidence,"I have never read Paul Auster before, I started to read it because I read that the book is about New York City.The first part is interesting, still pessimistic but Fogg's character makes me read.The second part, the big considences are not realistic and over pessimistic.Overall I am glad that I have read a book of the author but I will not read any other books of him."
3,Foggy manuscript,"Moon Palace is the story of Marco Stanley Fogg, a fatherless boy who finds his long lost father and grandfather at the age of 20. He is nearly killed at one point while pursuing a philosophical quest, trying to forsake the physical world like some buddhist monk. The end is strange and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness.I think that Moon Palace is a very interesting book, Paul Auster's great writing skills make this an unputdownable book. After a slow start the action proceeds at a rapid rate with something new happening on every page. Paul Auster weaves many stories into each other, however, making it difficult to keep track of the plot.All of these coincidences form the leitmotif of the novel, but in the end Paul Auster goes overboard. There are simply too many coincidences for the reader to accept causing the book to lose its integrity, therefore only three stars."
3,Seasons of Promise,I ordered a hardcover version of this book. When i recieved it it was a paperback. I contacted the seller and they gave me a full refund and let me keep the wrong copy. I half recommend and half not reccomend this book.
3,This book did not live up to it's promise.,"""Season of Promise"" was somewhat of a disappointment. This book could have been added on to ""The Starving Time: Elizabeth's Jamestown Colony Diary;"" in fact, it would have been better off if it was, as ""Season of Promise"" can't really stand on it's own two feet. Even though this is the longest of the three books, it feels the emptiest. With the addition of Caleb and Mistress Whistler (Anna), you'd think there would be more action, but there isn't. I still give this book three stars because it's apart of a good trio of books. And, once again, there is room for another edition. I don't recommend."
5,"This should be on your bookshelf, or at least on your toilet tank :)","This book is culled from the 'Concepts' column that Billy wrote for Modern Drummer magazine. In these pages, you get an immensely helpful array of articles that point you in different ways of thinking about drumming. Are you going to find page after page of notated exercises? Nope, but the title wouldn't really make sense if that were the point. But what you will find are a concise collection of ideas that will benefit your drumming, and are well worth your time to read, reflect on, and read again. The fact that there aren't more books for drummers like this on the market is a shame because Billy's book is the high-water mark (arguably along with Bob Moses' 'Drum Wisdom'), and this book should be required reading for anyone serious about musical growth and drumming as an art form."
3,Good but not mind-blowing,"I'd been looking around for drum books that tapped inside the minds of great drummers. I already own a lot of method books and wanted to improve my mental side of drumming. This book looked like it was exactly waht I wanted. I got it, and spent 2 days before I finished it. I must say, it's very easy reading and each chapter is short so it feels very fast.However, honestly speaking, its more like just talkiing to Billy Ward. I did get a few things out of this book that changed the way I saw things when I drum, but I guess for the price I paid, I was expecting a little bit more.This book is inspirational, but don't except to be blown away by it."
5,"Crane, Trixie and Duffy","I was blown away by Roland Jefferson latest book,One Night Stand, so I had to come back and order Damaged Goods. I didn't care about the reviews and ratings, I just wanted the book! RJ's writing makes you feel as though you're watching a movie instead of reading a book. He's VERY descriptive and his characters always stand out whether they're good or bad. His writing is colorful and pulls you into his story til the last word on the last page!This story is about a man (Crane) that's offered to get out of prison after only doing ten years of his 25 years to life sentence for a bank robbery. The warden has made him a deal: get the trunk out of its hiding place and to me without the FEDS catching you and you'll get your freedom. The trunk isn't any ole trunk.,,,the contents is worth millions! Sounds sweet, right? You'll have to order this book to find out if Crane takes the deal for a chance of freedom and if he does, does he make it out alive?HIGHLY recommended!!!!"
2,Damaged plot,"Doing 25 years in prison for a failed bank job, Alonzo Crane is allowed back on the street by the prison warden to go steal a secret cargo from the Dept of Justice. (Oh, of course!) He tries to go back and put together a gang that will be able to overcome a heavily guarded building. The plot, such as it is, gets muddier when he develops a crush on his buddy's cokehead girlfriend. If you think that that's contrived and over-simplified, stay tuned if you can. I found this something that would appeal to someone without a high school diploma."
2,One short night at Beast House!,"I bought this book simply because I am a Laymon fan, I have all his books and I knew before hand that the recommendations were not good on it. But I just didn't realise how poor the book would be. No disrespect here to Richard Laymon but I wonder did he ever approve of this book being released before his death. It is as others have said a very short book, printed with very large writing to make it look more than it is. It doesn't continue on from the Beast House trilogy and has very little of a storyline at all. It is not worth the money I paid and if you do want this book I would suggest buying secondhand or waiting til such time as it is released in paperback.I hope this book is not the shape of what is to come now Laymon is gone. As a great fan I would be severly disapointed."
1,A dissappointment,"I am a huge fan of Mr Laymon but I must say I found this one very dissappointing. Compared to the blood, guts, gore and excitement of his other novels this was tame. The only encounter with a beast was a rape and not a very convincing effort either. His other books on Beast house are full of excitement but this is a quiet days reading. Not one I would recommend"
2,Good Story Unfinished,I think that this book was still in the process of being written when he died. Therefore i think someone else just put a quick end to it then they released it. Because just has the book starts to get good it finishes. Its a poor book and not very big im a massive fan of Richard Laymon i own 12 books so far and im going to buy the rest.
2,Dissapointed,"This is more of a novella, not a full book.It is a short story and not a true continuation of the series by any means.That is not to say the writing was bad, or the other books are not worth it. Just this one is not worth the cost.I was expecting another full book to match the other 3 and ended up with a small story. The novella they included in this 'book' seemed longer than the featured Beast House story!If I had known it was not a full book but a novella, I never would have spent the amount I did for it.His books are interesting, but this is not a book. This is a short story that took me 15 minutes to finish. Feeling more like a quick side story or an after thought that a true novel."
4,Friday Night in The Beast House,"Not bad, I would have liked for the first story to be longer, his books are "" out there "", but that's what makes them good. Would have given 5 stars but didn't like the way the book was split up. Try reading "" The Woods Are Dark"" , that one's really out there!"
5,Love Laymon!,"As always, Laymon does a good job of twisting things around and keeping readers on their toes. This one is great!"
4,off beat & fascinating,one of the most unusual and interesting films i've seen in a long time. all of the acting is great.
1,Not good for anal.,"I wouldn't know about other applications, but this lube sucks for anal! It literally hurts to use it!After about 20 seconds the lube turns into a jell-o like substance that doesn't lubricate at all. In fact it creates more friction!Just saying, if you're doing anal use something like swiss navy/WET."
1,experienced some discomfort,"This product is kind of a staple, but I experienced some extreme discomfort in the form of a burning sensation. Did some research, and I'm not the only one out there.If you have any issues with sensitive skin, try something else."
5,Smart,"I like this product. I was looking for a functional way to store artists' pens, pencils, and Caran d'Ache crayons, so they would all be easily accessible. This does the job."
1,Mine was warped,"I returned this as the tops were warped ergo the drawers would not open, so really what is the point? I think they should use a little thicker wood for the top and sides or all of these issues wouldnt keep happening. I was hopeful I would be one of the lucky ones not to get a lemon, but not so. I recommend you go to an artist supply store like Pearl or Micheals and find something you can inspect yourself before buying. I was not happy and I hope Amazon stops carrying this product, it is a waste of resources to order & return."
4,3 Drawer Wood Pastel Storage Box,"I use it as a hobby storage cabinet. Works well, but the price could be lower based on the quality. Needs some felt or rubber scuff pads on the bottom of the cabinet to keep it from moving around."
4,Perfect fit for most pastels - see description.,"Padded drawers are worth the extra $, as they cut down powdered waste of expensive soft pastels. Removable dividers are convenient. Drawers are long enough for pencils, and the perfect height for all but the thickest round pastels.Stores a lot in a conveniently small space. Several stacked look great. A fine addition to any art room.-Only complaint: That they do not fit the thickest round pastels, so these must be stored separately."
2,Boring & Uninspired,Basic book - there are better and more in depth ones out there. I've already donated this one to the local Goodwill.
3,"If you don't like sad stories, don't read this","First let me say that I think this story was a wonderful, touching story. And also very heart breaking. Up until the end it had the potential to be one of my favorite books. But I guess I am just not a fan of sad stories. There is enough pain, grief and suffering in the world as is without adding to it. I actually started a new book immediatly after finishing this one just to get it out of my mind (I normally give myself a day think about a book I just finished). If it were not for the very sad end this book would deserve 10 stars."
5,ECELLENT!!,VERY powerful book that explores the relationship between a chimp and it's family. Very sad but very real. Reminds me of the visit I had to a zoo with a chimp in a glass enclosed cage. It came to the glass and placed it's hand against it and I placed my hand against it too. He had the absolute sadest look in his eyes I have ever seen. I stayed there with him for at least 20 minutes. He never broke eye contact and never took his hand away. I know he had been someone's pet. It greived my heart.
4,Almost human,"Jennie, a chimp, becomes as three-dimensional as any human in this tale, which shines a bright light on the question of what responsibilities researchers have to their primate subjects after the experiments are over."
5,as a book its okay,"A little ticked off. Was buying books for kindle on my iPod...and accidentally hit ""buy with one click"". Oops. No way to stop it, so Im stuck. I guess Ill read it eventually, however after reading the synopsis, its not a book I would have spent ten bucks on."
5,Wise and Warm Tales,"Tells the tales and trials of a collection of monks who are just adorable! The stories are honest, humble as well as painful. I laughed at the characters who were ridiculous, unreasonable or senile, and trickled some tears for those wounded. Every corner of my being was warmed by the healing encounters the main characters received. In a sacred moments they were treasured by a brother who embraced them with a mother's heart. The creative wisdom and powerful love of Peregrine inspired me (reminded me of the one who inspired him). I'll savor these characters and devour the next two parts to the series. Scrumptious read!"
5,My favorite book!,"This is the first book of three and they are all must reads. This is the only book I have ever read twice.The writing in this book is excellent. It starts with a mother telling stories to her daughter, the stories are about of a group of monks hundreds of years ago and their struggle with each other, themselves and God. it is not preachy at all.I have the paperback version which includes the three books that cover most of the life of the main character, Father Columba.Try it!"
1,Croquet Gimmick,"If you wanted this to be advertised as a ""desktop toy"" you sould not have advertised it as a ""Backyard Croquet"" I expected a backyard croquet set and when I recieved this piece of CRAP, I was thouroughly shocked and disappointed as were my family who were really excited about playing it.Dawn Havunen"
1,RIPOFF,"This isn't what you think it is- you don't need a backyard to play this- you can use it in your bathroom if you want. They say a picture says a thousand words but not in this case, they should have used a few mor words in their description like MINIATURE croquet set, would have saved all of us some trouble."
4,Just as described,"This set is exactly as it is described, if you bother to read the product description before buying the product. It weighs 4 ounces, has a ""desktop"" green and ""miniature"" set with a 3 1/2 inch rack. I don't know how you could mistake it for a full-sized croquet set."
1,Misleading advertising - not backyard size - minature set that sits in the palm of my hand.,I'm a 56 year old grandma who has been reluctant to buy anything over the internet. When I saw this Backyard Croquet game advertised I thought it would be great way to spend time with my grandchildren on the summer weekends.What a disappointment to realize that I had been ripped off on my 1st on-line order. I also bought the lucky horseshoes.I won't be ordering at Amazon.com or Toys R US again.
5,Now this is Music,"From start to finish, This is by far, The best C.D. I've heard in a long time. The guitars are big and crunchy, And the vocals lines are so catchy I cant help but sing along.Feels like a modern day Led Zepplin only heavier. Stand out tracks: Soul Alone:: Heavy and hooky all in one,Outside a hole::Very rocking,Left Behind:: Great Ballad(this should be a radio hit for these guys)Fade Away::Very Hypnotic with cool guitar effects.I highly recomend this C.D. to anyone who ROCKS!Good work guys."
5,Fantastic!!!,"From the first time I popped it in my C.D. player, It's been one of my favorites. These song are very addictive, I find myself singing one or another of them constantly. It's hard to pick a favorite song because there all good. Buy it and you too will be singing in no time.I swear."
1,Not up to Luna's usual standard,"I am generally a Luna addict; before Caramel Apple, I had never tried a flavor that I did not like. I was disappointed to find that, unlike the other flavors, Caramel Apple was far too sweet and did not possess the natural flavor and the balance between sweetness and fruit of other Luna flavors."
4,Like Real Life,"I love the story within a story.... The two things I like most about Jane Feather's romance novels are 1)they are not sleezy and 2)they have some historical information that make them feel more like ""real life"" stories."
2,Too much and not enough,"Too much about the food, too much [physical relations], not enough romance. Lust has to be grounded in reality when reading an historical novel - women of that era were just too indoctrinated against just having [physicale relation]for fun. In this novel it felt distracting and unrealistic. I liked the concept of this novel but the women, instead of being ""smart"" just came off frivolous, being more concerned about their sweet tooth than about women's rights. I couldn't even finish this book."
5,Wonderful!,"I really loved this book. The first page hooked me and I was a goner from there. Constance, Prudence, and Chastity are very well-developed characters that make you feel as if you know them personally. The story is very good with secret newspapers, self-indulgent papas, and a rather explosive relationship with a parliment member. I rather good read. I enjoyed every minute."
4,"Easy reading, but some oddities...","I like the writer's style of prose, and have enjoyed other stories by her. There were some things about this book that bothered me, however.From the start, the heroine and her sisters are at what I thought was a tea room - drinking tea and eating pastries. Then one of the women is asked to DANCE. That seemed odd.The heroine dates - as in going on dates to restaurants and parties with a man.Maybe that was done during this time period, but I don't think it was done by members of the England upper class.The story is written in what I've come to think of as a Regency style - but it takes place in the late 19th century.I did like the characters, but did feel that they jumped into bed too quickly and too casually.That sounds like I didn't like the book - but I did! The writer has a very smooth style of writing. I did enjoy the feminist viewpoint - it was refreshing."
1,"Ah, Jane you have such talent.....and you waste it!","Having read a few of Jane Feather's earlier books, I know that she can write a moving, fun and thoughtful book.The last two that I bought,'Venus' and The 'Bachelor List' I was disappointed and really wanted my money back, because I didn't finished either one. It seemed that the book was written for the porn crowd. I like a spicy book, but don't care for the female protagonist as a slut, and her gentleman 'friend' thinking that it is acceptable. The plot is transparent even for the genre, and the situations are not plot or charater driven, they are contrived and not in historical context. As I was reading the first couple of chapters I was thinking that Feather was more concerned to 'hook' you into her next two books than set the stage for this one. I will not waste my money on another Feather book."
1,INEFFECTIVE AND WASTE OF MONEY,I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years. They said it 'takes time.' I saw absolutely no improvement. I do not recommend this product.
2,Difficult to learn,DVE takes some pratice to learn how to use it properly. The HDDVD side is still pretty much useless with no audio to assist you. Its like they think you already know how to use it. The newer Blu-ray Verison is a much better product to buy.
2,Not sure yet,This HDDVD is a strange one. There are no instructions and when I checked the website there wasnt much going on there either. There are a couple of nice demo scenes but why would you want them unless you are a retailer. I may check it out again soon to see if I can make sense of it but I would rather watch a movie instead!
1,HD Side of Disc Will Not Load,"I pulled the DVD out of the case in mint condition brand new from Amazon. The HD side could not be read by my Samsung HT-WX70 system. I flipped it over and it instantly found the standard side of the disc. I did this over and over but the HD side would try to load and fault to ""No Disc"". I found a few others with the same problem on the web but I will update my DVD player firmware first and see what happens. If it works on the HD side after the update, I will create a follow up to this message.Sincerely - Bill"
1,WARNING- Still doesn't work with XBOX360 HD drive!!,"The DVE representatives said that the XBOX 360 Spring Dashboard updated (which was released this week) would fix the issue with this disc freezing in the 360's HD player. They apparently did not test this fix when they made that statement because it's still freezing after the update.I ordered this disc, 2 day UPS shipping, in anticipation of it working after the update (as was promised) and I can't tell you how disappointed I am with both DVE and Microsoft. It's not even the glitch I'm the most upset by, it's been the stone wall lack of communication with their customers that is unforgivable. In the age of communication, NOT communicating with your customers (you know, those people that buy your product so you can have money) is baffling."
1,Won't load!,"I waited several weeks after ordering for the new version of this highly-rated disc to become available. Consequently, I was very disappointed that the new material (Side 1) would not load into either my new Oppo DVD981 or my old Samsung DVD player. Side 2 - the 2003 version - loads without difficulty, but as reviewers for that disc have noted the actual calibration information is hard to find. Since I bought this disc specifically for the new material, I'm afraid I'll have to return it."
1,Still doesn't work on XBOX360 even after Spring Update,All of my other HD-DVDs work fine on the 360. Even if the 360's HD-DVD playback is flawed in some way this DVD should have been authored in such a way as to work around the 360's shortcomings. There aren't that may players on the market to test and I'm guessing the 360 is one of the most popular. There should at least be a disclaimer in the product description. People seemed to think the Spring Update would fix the 360 so this would play. It didn't. I think they need to at least setup an exchange program.
5,Digital Video Essentials,Did what it says it does. Allows me to have a base to adjust my Tele instead of just eyeballing it.
3,Would have been better if I had an HD DVD Player,This helped a lot when trying to tweak the settings of my new Plasma TV at the time. Although I couldn't view this in HD it did still work in my regular DVD player.Only other downfall is the HD-DVD never took off so the chances of having an HD-DVD player around is slim.
1,Why all the hype? Very disappointed (and not HD!),"When I was doing product research for my modest home theatre, people were adamant that I get this disc to calibrate my plasma TV. I opted for the HD-DVD version, as I figured it would include updated material. So when it arrived I popped the HD-DVD side in, preparing to perform a calibration of my set. I was disappointed to discover that the HD side is all demo material, basically showing off the marvels of high definition. The regular DVD side is where all the calibration test patterns are found.The menus are very poorly designed, confusing to navigate, narration is boring and too long, very little direction is provided, and the worst part is, I barely noticed a difference between the calibrated settings and the TV's default settings.In summary: waste of money, NOT high definition, outdated."
3,Can't figure it out,I have yet to figure out how to apply the info from this DVD to calibrate my TV.
3,ok but not the best,"I picked up DVE BR version and was pleased with the amount of test patterns and ease of use, I assumed the HD-DVD version would be the same but it was basically a slightly advanced version of the orignial DVE.not all that bad but it could be better"
2,HD Side doesn't work on Toshiba HD-A2,"It looks like not only the XBOX needs an update for this disk to work. I just updated my Toshiba HD-A2 to the latest version, but the HD side of the disk still doesn't play at all. It causes the player to hang up in the ""loading"" state. I had to unplug the player to get it to open the drawer."
3,HD Calibration tools were less than expected,"I already own the DVD version of Avia, as well as DVE, which work well for calibrating displays. I purchased this HD-DVD version expecting an even better, up to date calibration tool using HDi menus to add new calibration features and make it even easier to use. I was wrong! You still must use the older, dated DVD side for calibration and the HD-DVD side is for people with advanced tools who will ALSO enter the service menu WHILE using these tools. Basically, people who would use this, probably won't be buying it from Amazon. Save some money and buy the DVD versions instead, because that is the only side of the HD-DVD you will be capable of using.A new version of the HD-DVD is being released sometime in 2008 along side the Blu-ray version. This will be the version you want which is supposed to be a high def version of the old DVD version, that can walk you through step-by-step explaining what you are doing and why."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,"I don't usually like to write negative reviews unless I get really upset with the product... and in this case I am upset with the product!!! First, like all of the wonderful(insert sarcasm)HD DVD combo discs the HD side always has a few issues and in this case the player cannot even read the disc which is a problem with many of the combo discs. So strike one! To make matters worse the dvd portion, which is pretty much pointless except for little assistance is made for technicians or at least seems that way. Strike two! Strike three comes with the horrible presentation of the disc- just not flattering by any means... very boring to follow in every sense. Avoid this calibration disc at all costs even if you score one with the HD portion working you'd be better off winging it with a cheap made for dvd disc. Find a better calibration disc or wait until they make a decent HD one!.!.!.!.!"
3,an O.K. product,"Well, I was anticipating a much improved picture from my Sanyo PLV Z5, as reviews on the projector showed out of the box color wasn't all that great. Well mine must have been the exception, as I only made one change. I thought the picture looked good before, I just wasn't sure about the colors. The color filter didn't seem to help much, I adjusted the setting up and down and couldn't find what the video explained to look for, so I put the settings back to the ones I had before I started. The shuttle launch at the beginning is pretty cool as others have mentioned, if only they cranked up the sounds of the engines lighting and the roar of the rockets as it leave the launch pad...just patriotic music...overall though this disc would definitely help if your settings were messed with or the default picture isn't all that great. At least I know my colors and picture are good."
2,This is for SD line resolution only!,"A line resolution charts is a chart showing many different lines resolution. The highest number of resolution line one can see clearly from the display is the display resolution of how many lines. For example, if one can only distingish and see clearly the lines of 450, then the resolution of the display is 450, not 600.This line resolution pattern is the most important pattern I am looking for the HD-DVD. Because the most significant difference from SD to HD is resolution.I am very disappointed for this HD-DVD version of DVE still showing 500 and 600 line resolution charts. From SD to HD, A minimum of 1000 lines resolution chart is what I am looking for. Pioneer BD test disc have lines up to 2000 line resolution!There are two line resolution charts in the disc. One up to a max of 600 lines. One up to 500 lines. The is almost cheating! selling us the 1960's chart patterns during this full HD era."
2,too complex and drawn out,"Overall I listened to the DVD for an hour and got bored with everything. Tried to jump to the programming part and I couldn't figure it out. At the end of the day, if you have a few hours to listen to the DVD you will probably get what you need out of the DVD, but expect to spend 3 hours on the set up. This isn't something that you can just pop in and it gets done in 30 minutes."
1,Very disappointing,Im not going to write an indepth review about Digital video essentials. All you need to know is that its a complete waste of money and you can do better just toggling the controls and judging the picture with your own eye. This program sucks hard. I sold it the next day on Amazon.
1,Poorly organized waste of time.,The navigation of the absurdly confusing and complex menu system on this product renders it useless to all but the most patient and knowledgeable users. It is nearly impossible to find the area of the program where you actually calibrate your video. Most of the program is endless blather about various old systems of broadcasting video and moronic audio demonstrations. At this writing I have been unable to figure out how to use this thing to calibrate my new projector via my Toshiba HD DVD player. I am now referred to the website for some sort of explanation of how to find some value for my hard earned dollars. Wish me luck.
3,Mixed feelings about this,"DVE is still the best self configuration tool for Home theater enthusiasts and newbies alike. Price performance ratio is excellent, an no home with surround receiver or large TV set should be without it.However, the poor performance and being practically unusable with the top selling HDDVD player gives me headaches. Better wait until they can fully support the XBOX 360 HDDVD player."
1,What a disapointment!,I don't think I've ever had more problems with any disc. I'd highly recommend waiting for Avia!
3,Xbox 360 owners need to wait.,"I just received my DVE Essentials HD today. I cannot use the video calibration section of the disc with my Xbox 360 HD-DVD player. Apparently it requires a firmware upgrade that's not currently available. Calibrating my TV to the HD-DVD player was the whole point of buying this disc. Hopefully, the firmware upgrade will arrive soon."
1,Not for the end user!,You really need to be a television engineer to use this DVD to calibrate your HDTV. And you have to download all sorts of documentation from the company's web site. I found it useless and a waste of money.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,A total waste of money. It is inoperable in my Toshiba HD-XA2 DVD player. I can't believe I didn't read all the reviews first. Did I mention do not buy this DVD? You will calibrate nothing with it.
1,no teeth to this one,"Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to watch it, rent it, don't buy it!"
1,INCREDIBLY BAD,"To shoot a movie based around some low quality shark footage is something very courageous indeed !! But the result is in accord with the limits of budget and screenplay, and this movie is atrocious, a real joke."
1,A JOURNEY INTO A STUDY OF BAD MOVIES...,"This movie is plain horrible. The casting is unbeliavable bad directed or is totally uninspired. THis film is obviously low-budget, the sharks are a joke, it's almost an offense to the viewer. Casper isn't a hint from the great stereotyphed acting he gave us in ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"""
1,WHAT IS THIS !,"Saw this cover in my favourite rental store. We all know the name ""shark"" always calls your attention, since Spielberg's masterpiece, ""JAWS"". The cast was promising too, because Van Diem starred the great ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"". So, naturally, I rented this one. What a shame...The acting is almos non-existant, the ""terrible"" sharks doesn't scare no one,.. well, I'm out of words to describe this session of pure mediocre movie..."
2,attack of the (totally fake and unconvincing) sharks,how many modern day jaws rip-offs do there need to be. Well! Okay this film i would rank lower than 2 stars if it wasn't for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist. The other reason was i think Casper Van Dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him. But this movie stunk. In no ways does it compare to jaws nor even Deep Blue Sea. I hated almost every moment of it. If you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy Deep Blue Sea. Or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years. Don't be fooled this is a waste of time and effort. This film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none. ....
4,Makes for a pretty decorating accent,"These don't look real by any stretch of imagination but are very pretty nevertheless. I used them to brighten up a corner bookshelf.Just about to buy a second one for my guest bathroom linen shelf. For the price, they are a very nice decorating accent."
1,review of bra,This bra was not true to size. I ordered 3 and 2 of them did not fit. Not big enough around.
1,Oversized and not flattering.,"I ordered this bra on whim due to the low price. But I was really disappointed when it arrived. The bra was way too big and completely unflattering. The material was very thin. The bra didn't really seem to have much minimizing effect - instead it looks like I put on a ""cone bra."" I tried it on and immediately decided to send it back. There was no way I was going to wear it out in public."
5,great product,"This bra is wonderful. It is very comfortable to wear and has excellent support. It also does a great job of minimizing. I would definitely recommend this style of bra to anyone. As a matter of fact, I threw out all my old bras and bought all new ones in this style."
3,seams show,This was a very nice looking bra and was very comfortable and fit perfectly when I put it on. The one problem that caused me to send it back were the seams. Under a t shirt they were VERY visible. The bra was so comfortable I tried it under a heavy shirt but the seams were still visible. I had to return them.
4,Great Bra,Great support! Looks great on! Only issue is that some of the material is just a bit stiff and itchy. But I am sure it will soften up after a bit of use and washing. Otherwise its an all around great bra. I got it in my exact size 34 DD. fit perfect.
1,It Sucks !!!!!!,"This bra has no support and the straps , Oh my god , when u adjust them , they just go back to when they were before !!!! This is the worst bra , I have ever brought in my life , never again will I buy a bra from this maker , because their bras suck!!! Don't buy , it has no support and very flimsy!!!!!!!!"
4,good bra,This bra--is true to size--it fits perfect--make solid---feminine--attractive---good support (good for larger sizes DD)..Haven't found a bra this nice in a long time--I ordered the cream color--and am going to order the black and white one as well.Good fit--back doesn't ride up--straps are fine--even thought they do not have the padded shoulder strap...this minimisor works well and is nothing like others I have tried that made me feel like I was in a vise..My Grandmother sold loungerie her whole life in a high end store---she always said Lilyette was the best brand---she may have been right!!!
4,Pretty Great!!!,"I really like the bra, my only problem is I would like it to have a little more padding but other than that, I love it...I actually went and bought 3 more just like it and it is about the only bra I wear...."
4,More history and theory,"I ordered this book in order to have a pictoral reference for my training in Chen Style Taijiquan. Instead, I found the book gives very little in the way of illustrations to outline steps of the routine. It does in a written form discuss the steps and pitfalls common among students but not many photos.Intead, it discusses the history and theory of this style of Taiji. Actually, very interesting in this way. I think if one is to train and maintain practice in taiji they should know about its history and how to use the 'chi' for their health. This area is rarely discussed in taiji manuals.I think this book is really excellent in this aspect and worth buying for students and teachers of Chen Style Taiji."
1,A waste of money,"This book is terrible. I bought it for a class and by the end of the semester I was completely disgusted with it. It is full of errors: misspelled words, improper examples, inconsistencies in style and usage, and the like. It's hard to believe that this is the book's 8th edition! If you can ignore all of this then maybe you'll find some of the information useful. I'm not sure about its companion volume, I didn't bother reading it. All I know is that when I pay $120 for two thin books I expect far better quality than this."
2,Nearly Useless,"This book was required material in my reference course. As other reviewers have said, the book needs a good editor or proofreader. I had to read some passages several times because of confusion caused by strange grammar mistakes and typos. Also, I feel that the book is over-priced for what you get. It reads more like a poorly written thesis than an actual textbook. Much of the information on electronic resources is outdated. Two things saved this book from a one-star review. First, it did include a somewhat helpful section on conducting a reference interview. Second, the information on evaluating resources was fairly helpful. I was able to skim through a lot of the book because little of the information provided was new to me."
2,Embarrassing,"This was used as a college textbook in my class, and to be blunt, I and several other classmates were shocked at the poor quality.Spelling mistakes, poor grammar, etc. abound. If ever a book needed a good editor, this is the one!It escapes with 2 stars instead of 1 because the patient reader and beginner Library Science student may be able to glean some helpful advice from the text. At the very least, it seems the late William A. Katz knew a thing or two about the subject of reference work. I have to believe there are MANY better resources on this subject however. If not, then someone needs to start writing, there's money to be made!(Review edited for spelling)"
5,Exactly has described,It arrived quicker than I thought and it was in a better condition than I thought it would be for such an old book. I definitely recommend this seller to everyone.
5,Great tune,ATB at his best. During my college times there was no party without this tune. I'm still listening to this today :)
3,My initial opinion,"I have skimmed through this book cover to cover and given it a cursory reading. My first impression is that this book has a lot of good information. Two negatives: 1. This little book seems a little too pricey - $15+ for such a small volume - but again, the information it contains does appear good.2. The author apparently buys his chicks from a hatchery and doesn't cover anything about how to hatch out chicks whether from broody hens or incubators. This was very disappointing to me since, in my opinion, ""success with chicks"" shouldn't be solely dependent on mail-order chicks. It wasn't too long ago that shipping day old chicks across country was unheard of."
2,i feel ripped off,i guess this book would be alright if you had never raised chickens before but then you would probably want a more inclusive book like storey's or something similar. this is more of a pamphlet than a book and appears home published with small pages with big margins and lots of pictures and charts w/lots of spacing all black and white. there is some useful information it that he tells what has worked for him but there are thousands of websites where people give this out for free. it can be read in a half hour or so. if you have money just to toss around then buy this book.
3,Success With Baby Baby Chicks,"This was not what I was expecting. It is a very good book for people raising large quantities of chicks for commercial use, eggs or meat. I was expecting or hoping for a book for beginners raising a few chicks. A lot more detail on hatching eggs with an incubator."
1,Review on book for rearing baby chicks.,I was very disappointed in this book. After paying 56-00 I would have expected a lot more information to be included. Information included was not informative.
5,Life Saver!,I learned so much from this book. The author did a fine job describing the pros and cons of the different types of brooder equipment. This book is a must if you want to be successful brooding chicks. We built the electric lamp brooder on pages 61 - 63 in a couple of hours and have been successful. FYI - The box can be made smaller if you have 25 - 50 chicks. I also appreciated the behavior insight about chickens. Good luck!
4,good for larger scale,"Very good book, especially if you have more then a few chicks, 25 plus. I live in a smaller city and am only keeping 3 hens."
5,Success With Baby Chicks,"This book is very informative about ordering and raising healthy chickens. I highly recommend to anyone thinking about raising chickens that they read this book, especially if they plan on keeping them as pets. They will avoid a lot of frustration and potential heartache if they follow the instructions in this book.Requirements for very small to very large flocks are covered,and multiple methodologies depending mostly on scale as well.Also it is very informative about the different breeds and their relative characteristics."
3,Very similar to Still Got The Blues...,"This is Moore's 1992 follow-up to ""Still Got the Blues"". Very similar. Best track is the simply amazing ""Story of the Blues"" with some outstanding guitar work. Another standout number is a Little Milton song called ""The Blues is Alright"" with Albert Collins sharing vocals and guitar. B.B. King also appears on one song."
3,Great musicianship but lacks soul,"Gary Moore is a guitar wunderkind performing a rhythm and blues style rock. The guitar solos are amazing in a technical sense but as is often the case gives up soul and feeling in the process. Someone like Stevie Ray Vaughn is able to put it all together, but Moore is not in that league. The vocals are great, and so are the backing musicians. If you want to hear a great guitar player in a blues rock style, Moore will not disappoint. But don't expect nuance and soul."
3,Still got the blues is better!,"A pale copy of ""Still got the blues"". But ""Cold day in hell"" is a great song. The rest isn't bad, it's just that you've heard it all so many times before - but that's the nature of the blues."
3,Misses the mark,"There is no doubt Gary Moore can play guitar. His attempts at the blues have merit also. Somehow though, he misses the mark. I loved some of 'Still got the blues'. Same here. Unfortunately he likes to clutter the some tracks with background horns which rather spoil the potiential of those tracks. Still, some songs are worth listening to, but generally the album is less likable than 'still got the blues'."
2,BLues.. no..,"Gary should stop to making blues recordings and go back to good old hard rocking. Blues (john Mayall, Robert Johnson) were realy great influences when he first picked up the guitar, adn his voice is well suited to the style. But on the CD, the compositions by Gary are really weak. ""Still Got The Blues"" is much better."
3,Outdated,"I used this to freshen on on basic HBSE concepts for the LMSW exam. However, I would not recommend this text to others (or at least not the older version I purchased). It seems to be quite lacking in up-to-date social work perspectives and, at times, seems downright offensive."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made!,"Unfortunately, the rating system does not allow for negative stars, or I would give this movie a negative 10. It's worse than Fresh Horses (with Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald), and worse than the worst Kevin Costner movie I've seen (some beach farce shown on late night TV). The songs are terrible, the overt Bolshevik propaganda is nauseating, and some of the scenes are just plain stupid. I thought maybe the people who made this movie were laughing about how they made such an awful movie and people were actually watching it, but my greatest fear is that they actually weren't."

5,This book is about much more than selling...,"I've just read this book after meeting the author at a coaching conference. I read plenty of business books in my job, and I can confidently say that this little book is one of the more profound works I've encountered on business, selling, and life. Few of us are probably aware of the baggage we carry around regarding the nature of sales, marketing, and success. I feel Carol Costello has really opened my eyes and given me an entirely new way to achieve success without selling my soul. This book is as much about being a good person as it is about being successful. If you've even thought for a second that the two are mutually exclusive, buy this book!"
3,What it is and what it is not,"In the Soul of Selling the author takes you through a process that is really an attitude adjustment to vocation of selling. She does a fairly good job of bringing back the idea that selling is an important and proud vocation, once done properly. I appreciated the process since I personally have experienced the attitude of just not wanting to pick up the phone or send an email because I feared that prospects would just reject me. The book does give you a new look on selling and tries to displace the overall attitude of procrastination.The book, however, does not offer much in the way of her personal selling technique. I would have appreciated some form of at least qualitative advice on what techniques worked for her and which did not, over the span of her 30 years in sales.All in all, I was glad I bough the book but was just a bit disappointed I could not get more practical advice from it."
5,Applicable to Retail,Under One Roof operates a retail store that is a fundraiser for 35 non-profits. We use over 100 volunteers as our sales force and have developed a sales training program using the principles outlined in The Soul of Selling. This brings the actual practice of selling into a human realm that supports our mission and lets people enjoy the work.
5,Cinematic coolness,"A very smooth compilation of tracks, created specifically to invoke a cinematic feel. Oddly enough, this one slipped entirely through the musical cracks and has become a bit of an obscurity, although it could go toe-to-toe with many ""chill out"" and trip hop compilations and probably come out the winner due to its cohesiveness and the general fact that you won't need to skip any tracks since they are all very good.Get one while you still can!"
4,Thrilling... but not restored and whitout subtitles,"The movie is interesting, thrilling and filmed on location in a destroyed Berlin, with a great Cast.My eyes went during the movie over to Roman Toporow who played Lt. Maxim. He made only 3 movies in his life: ""Berlin Express"" was his first one. 1949 ""The Red Danube"" and 1950 ""Kim"" (the Russian).Camerawork and Light was great used for the movie and good that I understand German, English and French because there are no subtitles during the films. Also not on DVD available. Thats the ONE minus point I have for this DVD release.The picture quality isn't restored / remastered and contains some small defects. But mainly the picture quality is good"
4,High caliber tension!,"This was the first United States film unit to photograph in postwar Germany. The production was in cooperation with the United States, British and Soviet Armies of Occupation. The French sector was not involved.After an assassination attempt on a train travelling from Paris to Berlin fails to kill Dr. Bernhardt, a mysterious Nazi cell kidnaps him in order to thwart his plans for the reunification of postwar Germany.The film recreates Paris, the ashes of Frankfort and part of Berlin with sharp reflections on the various layers were present, as Soviet, British and American efforts to establish a minimum of order in this horrendous mess.The delirious performances Merle Oberon and Robert Ryan, the feverish tension around the kidnapping and agile direction of Jacques Tourneur make this curious film (along with Notorious and Sabotage) an unmissable film."
2,Still not the worst...but by no means the best.,"I have just finished reading this book after it's being handed to me by a friend and I must say I wasn't the most enthralled reader.By no means the worst book I've ever read, I felt that something was dearly lacking. With a single line of text not 25 pages in, Gideon gives away far too much than he should, and the suspense caves in.The characters, however, are fairly well written and you learn to appreciate and empathise with their inner and outward struggles. But, still, I feel there was a certain lack of intimacy between the reader and the book's population. I could have felt more for them if I knew them a little better.Ultimately it is a discovery the reader will have to make on his/her own. If you like original horror tales then you will appreciate Gideon's take on a new breed of Vampire. One that bares no resemblance to it's traditional ancestor."
1,The worst book I have ever read.,"Usually I am good at judging books, but this one was the exception. It was just plain old *bad*. Bad writing, bad storyline. I knew that it would be horrible from the first page!"
2,Chinese Gardens,"This book is impressive but in a cold impersonal way - I bought the book as a birthday present for myself given my intense interest in China and in gardening and returned it almost immediately. I realize this review is very vague and I cannot point to any discernable flaws in the book (other than its binding, which was cracking even as I removed it from the shrink wrap and opened it for the first time) it just left me very disatisfied."
1,A Blathering fat man singing and me a sucker for buying this trash,"The disk got here just fine no one twisted my arm, but I have heard cats fighting that weren't as abrasive on my ears."
1,Kundalini Tales,"Having previously perused Sauders Underground Bases And Tunnels I figured this book would be at least a decent read. Oh man! This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. 121 of 212 pages are strictly patents on electronic equipment which can be used for mind control. Unless you are interested in researching the patents this book is to no avail. The narration is disconnected, aimless, nomadic, stuttering, and (this bears repeating;) aimless. It appears that Whitley Strieber (who's blurb appears on the front cover) did not read this book. This book will soon be in a nearby landfill. You have been duly warned."
3,These may not be the licenses you are looking for,"If you want to add CALs to your Windows Small Business Server, this is not the product you want. The ""Transition Pack"" CALs upgrade your SBS CALs to full Windows Server CALs; this is a piece of paper only, and does not include any product keys for activating additional licenses."
1,Too leaking for my three!,"I am sad to share that this product is not one I or my wife can recommend. After giving the diapers a full test run with our 18 month old triplets, we can honestly say these are the worst diapers we have ever used. They leaked at every opportunity...day use, evening use & even with frequent changing! We are happy to report that Amazon is a wonderful company that stood behind their products, so we are still a very happy Amazon customers. As we suggested to Amazon, Fitti Diapers are not a product we would want our company to carry. Purchase with caution if you have a thing against diapers that leak."
1,Leaks & Rashes from This Diaper,I wanted to try these since they were so inexpensive but I'm sorry I wasted the money. They leak & caused my daughter to get a rash that wouldn't go away until I stopped using them. Never had this kind of trouble with a diaper before.
3,"Not a good fit, won't buy again.","These diapers look and feel just like the Huggies I normally use, but the sizes are not the same. The size 5 says for 27+ lbs. and they are super snug fit for my 30lb. little guy. By the 3rd one we used I had a leaky mess. These might be fine if they fit properly, but I think they are smaller than other diapers. Wish I had started by trying a single pack rather than a case of 184!"
3,good for day use...bad for nighttime,These diapers are great for daytime use but they leak at nighttime. I purchased the size 5 and they are the exact same size as my Huggies size 4...I am really upset about this as I have a huge box of diapers that are too small to use for my 3year old (who needs them only for night) the plan was to use them for both my 2 and 3 year old..but since they fit like a size 4 I cant use them on him. I would purchase them again for daytime use but it is a pain to have to have day and night diapers...Luvs are cheap and work great for day and night. Sorry Fitti I wont be back for more.
3,Good price but I don't think they hold as much liquid as the Luvs that I used before,These are a good price. However I don't think they hold just as much liquid as the Luvs that I had previously been using did.
1,Regrettable purchase,"Followed care instructions and pillow cover very stiff and scratchy - like sleeping on cardboard. Also, full of wrinkles."
5,wonderful!,"I love this pillow! It took me a day or two to get used to it but now I don't want to sleep on anything else. This company sells pillowcases in the size of this pillow as well - I'd get them right away, as the shipping cost is pretty high if you get them on their own and this size is difficult to find in other places."
2,Disappointing documentary of one very bad filmmaker,"Surely even Ed Wood deserves better treatment than this disappointing documentary from Rhino! Yes, it does look cheap and there are plenty of clips from Wood's films. But most of these excerpts act as if the actors are commenting on the Great Bad One's filmmaking abilities. Narrator Gary Owens is frankly annoying. Finding at least one well-known film critic, Leonard Maltin or Roger Ebert anyone?, to comment on Wood's legacy would have added immeasurably and given this effort a lot more depth. For now, I'll stick with Tim Burton's great film. This is definitely not the definitive Ed Wood biography."
4,A must for Roller coaster freaks!,"A must for roller coaster freaks! Gives a great overview of the history of coasters, how they work and the great ones today."
3,"Roller Coaster : Wooden & Steel Coasters, Twisters & Corkscr",The roller coasters in this book are the most beautifully photographed I've seen. I really enjoyed browsing through the pages. My problem with this publication is the mistakes through out the book. Anyone knowing their theme parks and roller coasters can easily spot these errors.
3,"Great photos, but some serious errors.","First of all, the photos in this book are just great! There are loads of excellent panoramic photos of big rides (Raptor and Mean Streak for example). The book also gives a good insight in the history of roller coasters.Unfortunately there are some major mistakes. One example: It has a chapter about roller coaster designers which among others featuers Anton Schwarzkopf, who actually never designed a ride by himself. He was a great roller coaster builder, but all of his designs were done by a brilliant engineer named Werner Stengel. He designed about half of all coasters still running today (rides like Mantis, Raptor, Millennium Force, Great American Revolution, Expedition GeForce...) and is not mentioned in this book at all.This from my point of view is serious and makes me thinking about what else is wrong in this book which I don't know about..."
3,"Nice Pictures,not for persons seeking acuracy",This is an excellent book from a photographer's stanpoint. I found many mistakes although. There is a lot of misconception of facts. It is still a nice book to have for a roller coaster fan.
3,Unstable Drivers,"I had this card for about a year. It ran all the games great except I had to deal with constant crashes. If you plan on getting this card for something like BF2 don't because for some reason that game crashes more then any other. I got so sick of it I went out and bought a NVIDIA 6600, but that was a few months ago so maybe the drivers they have out now are more stable for BF2."
5,"After 10 years, still his best album","Along with Ya No Soy El Nino Aquel and De Otra Manera, Cara de Nino is one of Jerry Rivera's best albums and it has stood the test of time, ranking among the best salsa CDs of the 90s.Solo Tu starts out very unconventionally, with dark mysterious strings, but soon the darkness is piereced by hot percussion, and then Jerry's angelic voice singing the beautiful melody. This song qualifies as a true salsa classic.Most of the other songs are very good as well. Wonderful innovative arrangments by the best in the business make this album shine above the others. The sound and feel of this album is unique and coherent through its entirety.Jerry's more recent albums, consisting of bland pop, and a rather unexciting remake of Frankie Ruiz songs, pale greatly by comparison."
4,Great album!,"Jerry picks up right where he left off with ""Cuenta Conmigo."" From beginning to end, this album is pure joy!"
4,Amazing socks but wish sizing was stated better,I LOVE the socks but should have ordered medium not large. Large is for women's size 10-12. Medium was for maybe 8-9 1/2. Couldn't find accurate sizing before buying product but happy with the quality of the socks. Awesome for skiing.
4,Good Air Purifier for the Price,"It doesn't explicitly state it in the product description, but the Air Purifier comes with a permanent HEPA filter and one pre-filter. The pre-filter is supposed to be changed every three months and the HEPA filter is supposed to be vacuum cleaned every six months. The pre-filters cost between $10 and $15. I've only had it running for several says and the pre-filter is already covered with dust, so it's really doing what it's supposed to be doing. What's more is that the air is so clean and crisp. The instructions say that you should run the air purifier 24 hours a day, but I think that's a huge waste of energy and only run it when I'm in the room, which seems to work just fine. It does make a lot of noise, but it's white noise, like a window air conditioner or a box fan. I almost didn't buy it because of I was afraid the noise would keep me up at night, but was pleasantly surprised that the white noise helps me sleep more soundly through the night."
5,Lonely Kings- Crowning Glory.,"I'v been a fan of the LK for about 5 years, and I swear every new cd they produce gets better and better. Crowning Glory is not only great, but the Lyrics of each song is emotional and does mean something in reality. Before I begin I would like to say that there new style of music is way different and better then the What if? release. There's a passionate state of emotions coming from there lyrics and the Lk are so friendly to there fans. Anyway I totally believe that there cd will be enjoyed by hundreds of fans and family. Anyway I would like to invite you all to lonely kings official site at lonelykings.com, also A LK fan page where you can win free stuff will be developed soon at lonelykings.cjb.net so check it out!"
4,pretty display case,"This display case is nice, the only problem I had with it was that the flag part was very hard to close once we got the flag in it."
2,Not very flexible,"The toast we get out of this machine is generally okay, sporadically one side is more toasted than the other. The problem is that the two sides can't be operated independently. The slots on the right pop with the slots on the left. This isn't very flexible when you're hosting a buffet-style brunch or making breakfast (e.g. eggs over-easy) serially for your kids.One of the other reviewers thought the right-side slots were broken, I think they were just running into this rather limited design.BTW - I've seen cheaper Krups toasters with fully independent pairs of slots."
1,Same problem - lever doesn't work!,"Ours worked for about a month too, and now we've lost one whole side of it. I definitely wouldn't have paid all that money for another two-slot toaster. Don't waste your money!"
2,Not the Best,"We have owned this item for over 3 years. It still works but has been a disappointment. Occasionally one of the levers will not stay down. It doesnt toast evenly - no matter what you are toasting. Im not impressed, and if I had it to over again, I would buy something different."
1,Its a clinker!,"Same experience as others here... after a while, one side gets stuck and wont work. Returning a toaster for warranty work is not something I enjoy - i think I will avoid Krups from now on."
3,A bit disappointed with Krups,"Style, size and features are fine. But this toaster simply does not provide a nice even toasted surface on the bread."
1,"All Looks, No Brains","Pros: Looks good in my kitchen.Cons: Everything else.Two reasons I bought this toaster: it was available for $23.99 at a local Ross and looks. I wasted my money. This is the slowest toaster I've ever experienced. By the time it gets your bread to anything remotely resembling brown, it will have completely dried out the bread, not to mention make you late for work. It doesn't matter what settig it's on, it still takes forever. And for those, like me, who like things almost-burnt, it's useless."
1,Forget about it !!,"Question: How do you engineer a toaster that doesn't toast?I kept adjusting the settings thinking I MUST be doing something wrong. Now I know I'm not the best cook, but could I have actually forgotten how to make toast? Unfortunately for Krups - I think the answer to that is no.If you want a toaster that toasts only one side of the bread (and no I don't have it on the bagel setting), then you'll love this toaster. As for me, I'm on Amazon today reading reviews trying to figure out what I will buy to replace this piece of junk."
1,Piece of junk,"I guess I got off better then some since mine did last a little over a year before the one side stopped going down and stayed locked. On the other hand it broke right after the warranty expired! A complete waste of money, I'm buying a cheap one next time around and I will never buy Krups again!"
2,Didn't work out of the box.,"After unpacking and plugging in, discovered that the right side would not work - we couldn't get the handle to engage to start the toasting cycle. I also felt the handles, being plastic, felt cheap and that they weren't going to hold up to repeated use - although that is based on first impressions, and starting off on the wrong foot provided it didn't work out of the box."
1,Beware this toaster!,"We purchased this toaster from Amazon.com last July. It arrived in August, and broke less than two weeks later (one side would not go down). Sent it for repair, and a month after that received a new one from Krupps. This one was broken right out of the box - identical problem on the other pair of slots. Immediately returned that one (early October, 03) and finally after fighting with Krupps, we received our replacement IN FEBRUARY 04, 4 months after sending it in and SIX months after our original order. Krupps does NOT have a money-back guarantee and will do nothing but send replacement toasters for the period of the warrenty - and we were told that the 1-year warrenty starts the day you receive your ORIGINAL toaster. So... we have six months of warrenty left on this current brand-new one now."

You'll be much happier."
1,"Sorry, but its junk.",Sometimes you buy something that you know is too inexpensive. That is the case here. The bits were very poorly made and dull dull dull. I put them in the trash and got fished my old set out of the trash can. The old ones are better than the new ones.
3,Just so-so,"These are OK for really soft woods, but for harder woods look at some other higher quality products. I wanted to use these to drill holes into windows to install alarm contacts, but these just can't drill through tough materials."
1,poor cutting,the tools are cheap china junk. you get what you paid for. the tools came with rust. they do not cut well as they have few cutting teeth. almost burn the wood you are boring.
5,Mother Goose is perfected! I Spy and Gorgeous Illustrations,"This version of Mother Goose is just gorgeous. Of course, you must be a fan of folk art to appreciate the illustrations, which are so colorful and lively! This book is 54 pages and includes classic nursery rhymes. Six rhymes are presented (3 per page) on a two page spread and each has a small illustration to accompany it. Then, turn the page and there is a gorgeous two page spread of a complete folk art scene that includes each of the six small illustrations from the previous set of pages. This makes for a delightful 2 in 1 purchase for you and your child, an I Spy nursery rhyme book. It is just lovely and I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this book. I bought it as a gift for a friend and now I must buy it for my own son, despite the fact that he already has 3 nursery rhyme books! It's that lovely!"
5,Mother Goose,Very nice. Art work is excellent and there are some nice less familiar rhymes included.
2,Short Attention-Span Mother Goose,"This book is like many other so-called Mother Goose collections available now: it truncates the original poems into little snippets. For instance, the original 12 verses of Hickory Dickory Dock are represented by one verse. This is true all the way through the book. Very few poems are present in their entirety, and those are the very short ones. If you're looking for a picture book, it's fine. But the description should, and doesn't, explain that the text is excerpts from the original (and wonderful) children's poems.The editors write at the end of the book that Moses is passing down an age-old folklore tradition. But he, and his editors, and the editors of similar books, are erasing more than they pass down. Do the sound-bites have to start in the cradle?"
2,Beautiful but not suitable for 4-6 year-olds.,I bought this book after I read the reviews and saw that it was recommended for ages 4-8. The book is beautiful but for the most part impossible to read (forget learning those riddles by heart) for this age group. I had trouble reading it for the first time due to the old English words/constructions used in this book.
5,Booyah!,It's Chimaira that says it all they just know how to rock it. Power Trip was one of the first songs I heard from them and it just blew me away! The extra songs definitely make getting the special edition worth it as well.
1,Not Worth the Cost,"I have tried this shampoo and conditioner for the last month and it has done nothing but make my hair dry and unmanageable. I have wavy hair that is now frizzy from this stuff. I had hoped for more because it is a higher priced set. However, it has let me down. Since I cannot return it (because it was opened and used), I will not be ""trying out"" any other beauty products from this site."
5,"hydrating, natural,","both of these products are extremely gentle, very hydrating. The best thing I loved about this shampoo & conditioner was that they are so easy to rinse out; they are very light and don't leave heavy film or weigh down the hair."
2,Overpriced,"From an African American hair texture point of view...not all that its hyped up to be. I decided to make a go after the sample sizes, because I was not sure if I wanted to pay the fifty something dollars for shampoo and conditioner. I was highly disappointed and not to mention it did not leave my hair any softer then when I've used other products with olive olive, proteins and aloe in them. It actually felt very drying to my hair. I guess if you have oily hair this is a wonderful product for you to use, but not for all hair textures across the board. I did give it 2 stars though, because it did do a good job of clarifying. I was excited to receive this product because of its natural ingredients, but I question its purity. For me it was a big NO."
5,Absolutely Amazed About Product!,"I just recieved the 10 product sample pack of this product. When I can afford the larger ones I will be getting them. I was kinda blown away. The shampoo and conditioner make my hair really thicker and shiner. It feels so much different. I've tried the washing powder, toner and cream too. I am a 54 year old woman and I've noticed an amazing difference in just after one use. I used it before going to bed and this morning my wrinkles around my chin were visibly less pronounce then before. When I used the washing powder again this morning I actually had a shine on my face. I had roses in my checks, ha! I have used Kinesene products but this one really beats it. My face has a smooth, really great feel too it. I am hooked. Now to find a bank who will loan me the money to buy it, lol!"
3,Perfume,This perfume is okay if I hold it at a distance over my head and spray so it drifts down onto me - otherwise it is too strong for my taste.
5,Very Nice,I have been using the MDX1600 to record wave files into my pc and I am really really impressed. I still can't believe that I could get such a professional sound from this product. The MDX1600 might have a cheap price but it doesn't by any means feel cheap. It has a very solid structure and it does exactly what it says it would do. I am very pleased with this purchase and the service at Amazon.com.
3,Black Rob - The Black Rob Report,"Pretty decent album. 3.5 stars. I was feelin most of the production. The lyrics are decent. Nothin great. Most of the beats are banger beats. Definately wasnt feelin all the tracks. Some werent sh** really. Some of the tracks hes on point of what hes talkin bout n all but I dont think it deserves 4 stars. It kinda seems like sometimes your listenin to some Dark sh**, then its seems like a bubblegumish feel, hmm, dont really know just seems like. But you want a straight rap album, decent stuff, cop it.My Top 5 Songs1.They Heard I Got Life2.Star In Da Hood3.B.L.A.C.K4.Yall Know Who Killed Him5.Warrior"
4,HOT!,"Ok im just gonna come out and say this right now, Bad Boy Records is back, (tho i really hope diddy stays in hiding). This cd is blazing, for a couple months i thought bad boy just died after their terrible decision of making a cd with ""da band."" This cd's production is hot as hell, and BR brings the life back to bad boy. Best songs: ready, star n da hood, watch your movements, br, when you come home, smile in ya face, and help me out."
4,The Black Rob Report Surprised Me - Like Whoa,"It's been five years since Black Rob last dropped an album. Since his last release he's had a few brushes with the law, so The Black Rob Report was long overdue. With the success of ""Whoa"" it would be hard for him to top it, in my opinion anyway. I didn't know what to expect when I played the CD. The hypnotic beats combined with Black Rob rapping is what makes this album worth listening to. There's something on the album for everyone-from gangsta to straight up club songs. Black Rob's sophomore album is worth giving a shot."
3,Solid follow-up to Life Story,"There's no Lox, Mase or even Diddy on this album but Rob's still on Bad Boy and delivers a decent album. While his rhyme style may sound a little dated compared to today's Kanyes, Eminems and Jeezys, Black still can bring it out on bangers like ""Star in Da Hood"", ""Ready"" and ""Fire in Da Hole""."
4,Very Nice!,"I never thought the album would be this solid, since his last album came several years ago. the lyrics are on point, the beats are sic (some club bangers and some street laden beats). Black Rob's flow is still as nice as ever...one of the nicest MC's ever.Really a surprising album for 2005, one of the best rap albums that came out."
2,"CANT DO IT,SORRY!! I TRIED,NOT BY A LONG SHOT!!","I REALLY DONT SEE WHAT ALL THA HYPE IS ABOUT...HIS FIRST ONE TO ME WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THIS ONE HERE...MAYBE IT'S A COME BACK,BUT LIKE LL SAID DONT CALL IT A COME BACK."
4,Black Rob,"I really didn't think this would be a good album, but I was VERY wrong!!! This cd is great!!"
3,"Don't get me wrong, but I love George Carlin.","Every CD up until this one, I would give 5 out of 5. I love his humor, but something in this was just lacking. It seemed like a bunch of corny jokes put together rather than thought provoking stand-up. Given he does tell a lot of ""jokes"", they usually follow a theme with a start and a finish. In this CD, it is all thrown together with simple humor. I hope the man isn't loosing his touch."
1,"What happened to you, George?","Yes, I'm another fan who has all of his albums... to a point. Somewhere after ""What Am I Doing in New Jersey?"" he started to get angry and his whimsical humor began to sour. After staking his claim on pointing out universal foibles and the quirks of American culture and dark edge of politics, he got mean and his humor became darker and darker until this point, at which point I truly find I fail to care what Carlin has to offer anymore.After a gloss of current, post 9/11 politics he moves on to bathroom humor, discussions of scabs and bodily functions. This isn't Carlin at his best, this is Carlin channeling the weaker parts of the Jerky Boys and that's a shame.Don't bother with this disc. Stick with the nostalgia of FM & AM and Place For My Stuff. Leave him to his anger."
1,Foul Language Alert,"I have heard George--obviously toned down--on some late night talk shows in years gone by. Even the ""explicit language"" warning on [this] didn't convey what I was in for. If you think humor is foul language, go ahead and buy the album. In my opinion, though, the purveyance of this kind of [tape] simply dumbs down our society even more than it already is."
3,Not His Best,"Pales in comparison to anything he did in the 90s - not all his fault, he had to cut material as not to seem like a total jerk in the wake of the patriotic, disaster-torn social climate. But it's a pretty good show that should give Carlin fans a decent fix."
3,My daighter loves this -- she loves snakes! Odd girl!,Best sort of gift for someone who loves things -- and not the typical hat & mittens set or earrings!
5,Music that feeds the soul,"When I first encountered this music, I was stunned at the incredible soul touching quality. To hear Oscar's music is like having the veil of the universe opened and the pure essence of the divine bathing one's soul. This music is a real gift for all to experience!"
5,Vital,"Este disco es uno de los mejores de este cantautor italo-venezolano.Letras profundas y buenos acompañamientos musicales. Incluso incluye un tema instrumental: ""Otoño""Destaca la version acustica de ""y te pienso""Un disco de coleccion."
2,"Long-winded, tied to Websphere and VAJ","This is not a good choice if you want to learn how to write web services quickly. The book is long-winded, covering 280 pages before starting the first example of an actual web service. It also uses an obsolete version of IBM's Websphere (v3.5) for its examples. There are several pages of screen shots showing how to use Websphere v3.5 to create and deploy a web service even though the author says ""This is not a book on Websphere"". Make up your mind. What is even worse is that he wastes several pages showing how to use the ultra-bloated Visual Age for Java to develop web services.One goal of web services is to be implementation neutral so tying the explanation of web services development to particular tools goes against the spirit of web services.On the positive side the author has some useful insights and tips on the technologies involved in web services. He also provides a web site with working web services."
1,Are you kidding?,"This is not a book for technically oriented people looking for answers on web services. Questions you have on things such as scalability, security, and business models are either not covered or are glossed over at a 50k foot level. Little or no examples are given that will stand up to a developers scrutiny. There are no new ideas here. None. There are no solutions to the important questions here. None. This is yet another book in the ""Expert's Series"". I've bought a number of books recently by Apress. For most of these, I have wondered if the author learned the subject in order to write the book. I am convinced that this is the case here."
4,Good introduction to Web Services,"This book provides a good, detailed introduction to Web Services, from an architects point of view. Allows one to identify where these technologies could be applied, and how to apply them.The Java examples are good. Explains the various technologies quite well.Buy it !"
1,"No coverage of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, or standard Java APIs","The author has chosen to build his own completely customized web services architecture. He doesn't even mention SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, or any of the standard Java APIs: JAX-RPC, JAXR, or JAXM. Instead, he designs his own protocols using XML and servlets. Unless you're looking for job security by writing software noone else understands, skip this book.At this point (June 2002), your best bet for learning Java web services is to download Sun's Java Web Services Developer Pack and go through the tutorial. The best book I've seen is ""Building Web Services With Java"" (Sams) but the book just skims most of the APIs because they're so new. But it has good coverage of SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI."
5,Original content,"I've read many of Hugh Ross's books and hesistated to buy this one because I thought it might overlap largely with what I'd read. But there is a log of material here that I've not read elsewhere, either from Hugh Ross or anyone else."
1,seasick in Bhutan,Jerky amateur camerawork and unplanned narration. Bad editing. Hardly worth even two bucks. Should have been posted on YouTube.
3,Like It,"I like close harmony duets, so on a whim I bought the Wilburn Bros. The first time I listened to it I liked just one song. But it did grow on me, and now I like it. I wish I had listened to it before buying it though, it would've helped."
3,Ok album,"I don't listen to this now as much as I did after purchase. Have to be in the mood for his music, but still a good album."
5,Y U R I at her best.1993-94,"Its been a long time since most of us latin music fans in are mid 20's heard anything This good from Mexico's orignal Miss Blondie.Also She is the Madonna of mexico. Nueva Era is a true yuri classic.... I mean 99% of all the tracks are great. Yo se, Amiga mia,The best track Detras de mi ventana. Yuri gave her 150% here.. Also another good one is her Espejos de alma album."
2,Well-meaning but Pretentious,"I agree with the previous reviewer but am writing only to correct the names. Joe is not the main character, he is a fat man the hero Michael loves. Joey is the brother with brain damage. HOWEVER, as I watched this film it seemed to be that Michael was the one with brain damage. Outisde of a love for rings (which he shares with one of the Beatles) Joey seemed much saner. The film though well-meaning on the part of the actor/director/producer/writer/editor is yet another proof that a second viewpoint (rather than have one person do it all) is necessary unless one is a genius like Chaplin or Welles. I found it impossible to identify with the character or even to like him. It's one of those films that bore to such an extent one keeps looking at a watching saying: ""40 minutes to go...30 minutes to go...20....10...7"" That no other film appears with this director/star is not suprising."
2,Another depressing indie,"Depressing black and white portrait of Joe, a puffy faced gay man in his 30's who is sexually attracted to older and even less attractive men. Joe and his twin brother had severe fevers when they were young and it left him with a bad heart and his brother brain damaged. At that point their father checked out. Their catholic mother raised the boys and Joe is now a men's washroom attendant when he's not cruising New York's Central Park. The film is disjointed and goes nowhere. Much time is spent as Joe takes one candle lit bath after another. It appears that the director knew he was in trouble and hoped that showing some skin would raise interest. On the box, this video was described as Dream-Like. I think that's code for sleep inducing."
5,Classic Trouble show,"I saw Trouble twice on their Manic Frustration tour and they were amazing. I have waited for an official video release for a long time and now it's here. They play almost everything a long time fan would want to hear, they sound great and the video is shot extremely well. What more could one ask for? Buy this and discover a great band at the top of their game."
2,Looks well made but broke easily,"I bought an all-metal pitch fork to do my heavy duty garden work, mainly digging up my vegetable beds. I bought this one for the light duty stuff... like mixing in fertilizer or turning over my raised beds. Well, on my first use, I was using this to turn and loosen the dirt in one of my raised beds and without much resistance at all, the fork twisted out of alignment with the handle. I was shocked... by the looks of this, it's well made and I was not expecting it to fail so easily. Maybe I just got a bad one. Maybe not. I'll go on using this as best I can, but with each use it's getting looser and twisting pretty easily. I'm really disappointed with it."
3,okay story,"not a bad 1980's movie, not as good as I remebered it to be. May not watch it again, was a good movie in it's day"
3,"Not bad for a low budget , not scary though",Julian Sands was good as the warlock who travels through time looking for his book of evil. The warlock hunter was sincere and true to his character. This movie could have been better with more CGI. But as it stands it was ok. Enjoy!
1,"Not scary - very dated, kinda humorous","I love horror movies, but this one is very dated and campy. Had to fast-forward through much of it."
1,error,"I live in Europe and I didn't think of one thing; my dvd- player has a region- code. So, I can't play the dvd Warlock ! What to do now ?"
1,not worth the time!!!!,this movie is such a bore that i sold it 2 hours after i watched it. not even lori singer was able to help this sad and unscary movie. a waste of time and money.
3,Warlock I,"Although not as good as part 2, this originated the Warlock series of movies. Special effects and color are not nearly as good as parts 2&3 but it is worth buying to complete the collection. Part 2(Armageddon) is OUTSTANDING and a must-have for occult/horror/fantasy fans."
4,warlock,"This is one of my favorite movies. Julian Sands does an excellent portrayal of a Warlock, traveling through time to find a way to free Lucifer and to un-do creation and the human race. loads of black magic and spell casting. Much violence and mayhem too. For those of us who missed this one. Check it out. Very entertaining!"
4,A viewer,A splended fantasy thriller! WARLOCK has big time thrills and a remarkable story line! WARLOCK is a 4 star chiller with a terrific villan!
1,"What, widescreen is too good for us?","A great 4-star flick---fun, witty, and graced by marvelous performances by Sands and Grant. But....why on earth (or hell) did the company bother with subtitles and surround sound and other non-essential materials, and forget to offer the film in widescreen? It's a bit of a ripoff, and shows a great disregard for the DVD buyer."
4,Good movie!!!!!,"I liked ""Warlock"" a lot. The whole ""male witch"" aspect of the movie was very good, and I love Julian Sands. It was also kind of on the funny side."
4,Just about what you'd expect...,"No surprises, except possibly the -great- ensemble cast and Dennis Quaid's wonderful job in a serious role as a guy who goes from big fish (small-town coach) to small fish (pro player) very fast. The director sets a steady pace, and we get to know the characters, which I liked. 'Based on a true story,' and (I think) its pretty easy to spot the things that are the fruits of the screenwriter's imagination, but a very good movie. Emotional themes, rediscovering lost dreams, the importance of family, are there but not overdone (not too much anyway). Take your kids, even if they're not all that into baseball, this may give them a new appreciation for how grown men can love a game."
5,Unexpectedly Good,"I'm not baseball fan, so I paid no attention to the ads for this film when it was released and I learned about it for the first time when I was coaxed into watching the DVD. I was greatly surprised. At the heart of this film is a dream. Anyone who's ever had a dream, given up a dream or might still be working on one can relate to Jim Morris' story. For once Disney is light on the saccharine scenes because it doesn't need it. ""The Rookie"" maintains its authenticity while telling a fantastic story. The scenes are well done, the script fantastic, the acting believable. It's a perfect film to watch with your kids. The bonus material on the true story behind the movie is really inspiring."
5,See it,This was a great movie. Can't believe I waited this long to see it. Was on plane to London watching part of it when it came out on dvd many years ago.
5,Great movie & Price!,Great movie - had to have it for my collection. Great seller - will be my first stop for any DVD purchase. Great price and fast ship. Thanks!
4,If you liked The Sandlot,"This movie is good but it could've been five stars. Disney was the right people to make this film. Some of the pitching scenes were way too long. I got sick of waiting for the scene to be over, not that I didn't like this movie."
5,A Dream Fulfilled!,"My daughter talked me into watching ""The Rookie"",. bless her heart! This movie has it all, humor, dreams, both dashed and fulfilled and, ultimately, a tale of rewarded perseverance.Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, a West Texan high school baseball coach whose dreams of a big league career seemed to have floundered on the shoals of injury.Coaching the chronically under performing Owls, Morris tries to inspire his team to dream of a life beyond their small town horizons. The team turns the tables by proposing a bargain. If the Owls win District, Morris agrees to go to a major league tryout. After the Owls deliver on their side, ""It's your turn, Coach."" Encumbered by three children, one an infant in a stroller, Morris fulfills his end of the bargain.I won't ruin it for you, but suffice it to say that Morris confronts the hard choices of doing what he wants to do or doing what he was meant to do. At the end we are left with a true story of a dream fulfilled. Great Movie!"
2,Not As Good As I Thought It Would be,"The Rookie wasn't very good. I thought it would be great because i love baseball and softball, but I guess i was disappointed. I thought it was pretty boring. Dennis Quaid did pretty well but still the movie didn't do much for me."
2,Nothing,"""The Rookie"" lacked originality and focus. It's kind of like two stories that are lamely put together. The first half of the movie was about his success in inspiring his high school baseball team to a winning season, and the second half was about his fulfilled dream of pitching in the ML. There was no cohesion in the film and I wondered if the team's success would have been a better movie all by itself. This movie did nothing for me."
4,Built like an Acorn Tree: Strong and Sappy,"The story of Jim Morris couldn't be more inspirational. A near 40 year old high school science teacher/baseball coach who makes a bet with his team that if they win a playoff game then he will try out for a major league team. Well needless to say, Morris' high school team wins the championship and the players all tell him ""it's your turn coach"". Jim goes to try out for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with his 3 small children with him and without his wife knowing. Well, Jim winds up throwing harder than he ever has in his life, 98 mph! Jim is now faced with the gut wrenching decision of having to leave his family that he adores or pursue his dreams. The Rookie plays out way too sappy for me, there are an abundance of overly sentimental moments in the film that for continuity's sake should have been sped up. But hey we're talking a G rated Disney film, here! Anyway, baseball fans and fans of the underdog alike will love this film. Recommended."
4,great movie and truley insperational to any sports coach or athlete.,Very good movie and this movie shows every athlete that it's about the right coach to fix a losing team. they are very tough to find but if you get the right coach in the right situation you could turn any team around.
5,Baseball movie,My husbands favorite baseball movie. He had it before and he wore it out. So I got it on dvd
4,The Rookie is not for kids under 40,"I liked this film on many levels, I just can't see a kid sitting through the last hour of it! It is a wonderful story of self-discovery and coming to terms with acceptance, approval, and being true to yourself. But the film is also slow and thoughtful by adult standards, I just don't think it really made it for audiences both young and old."
5,A Great Baseball Movie For All,"There is something special about ""true"" sports stoires to me, and I enjoy the stories where a player reaches a dream. such as Invincible.The Rookie fits the mold, as it follows Jim Morris, a pitcher who never made it all the way to play ball, but fell short. But he got one more chance and was able to make it to the big league. (In fact I remember rooting for him on the comeback trail when the story developed.)Dennis Quaid is great as Morris, and you cannothelp but root for him. The movie is very well done, not being overly melodramatic or too ""rah-rah"" as the story develops to the point where Morris plays on a field of dreams.This movie does not seem to get mentioned as often as other baseball movies that instantly come to mind, such as Bull Durham or A Field Of Dreams, but it is a very good one and deserves a place in any collection of baseball movies."
5,A Great Story,"'The Rookie' is a story about a 30-something high school baseball coach getting a second shot at his dream to play major league baseball.Based upon the real life story of Jimmy Morris, Dennis Quaid does a superb job playing Morris. Jimmy is teaching chemistry and coaching on the side. He is leading a team that has done poorly for several years. He motivates them and strikes a bargain. They demand that he try out for the big leagues if they can win their district title. He agrees and the rest is history.This show is about doing one's best, chasing the dream, and life. It is inspirational and very well done. It is family friendly and can be enjoyed by all ages. I recommend it."
4,The Rookie,"""All's well that ends well"" and The Rookie leaves everyone feeling good. The Rookie does an excellent job in evoking an emotional response from the audience. Applause for the triumphs and tears for the setbacks were common among viewers. Dennis Quaid has not lost his touch and Rachael Griffiths turns in a very believable ""Western woman"" performance. Perfect timing for a release with opening day to the 2002 baseball season! A great movie to kick off the Spring!"
2,Should have been better,"The movie is good..but when you read the book The Rookie aka The Oldest Rookie, the movie looks like fiction. Morris' dad was actually not that supportive of him at all and I thought it should have covered the resentment he got from some teammates. Disney's other sports films are better because they are more in-depth than this one."
3,An All American Tale,"Starring Dennis Quaid, this based on a true story about late comer Pitcher Jim Morris and his rise into the big league. This is your typical Disney underdog film with all the right stuff. If you liked Remember the Titans, this will feel eerily familiar. Quaid is wonderful as Jim Morris and brings a real 'all american' persona to the character. Australian actress, Rachel Griffiths (Hillary and Jackie) puts on a fine performance as Morris' wife and does a great 'american' accent. The story foolws Jim as he teaches high school baseball and science classes. He makes a bet with his team that if they win District championship he will try out for the big leagues again. Of course they win and he tries out. With his throwing of a 98 mph fast ball, that pretty much tells you his fate in the film. A great family film, clean and wholesome. Pretty rare today!*** stars."
3,DRAMA,"A real-life story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) who had to drop out of minor league baseball because of an injury to his pitching arm. Twelve years later, inspired by the young men on the high school team he coaches, Morris is convinced to fulfill his own dream and try out for a professional team. With perseverance and confidence, he finally steps up to the plate, and after his pitching is clocked in the high nineties, he is signed to a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and soon after, moving onto his lifelong dream - the major leagues."
5,"A Touching, Great, Feel-Good Flick","I got to see a sneak preview of The Rookie in Dallas. I was really anticipating the release of this movie for a while, and was hoping it wouldn't [stink] like Pearl Harbor. Th movie is about a 37 year old man who always dreamed of being a major league pitcher. Today, he is a science teacher who coached the high school baseball team. He makes a bet with them: They win State, he tries out for the pros. They win, and he makes AA minors for D-Rays. He pitches so well, he makes it to the majors. The movie i a bit long, but all of it entertains you. Th acting is superb, the settings are very convincing, and the story-telling is very well done. If you are skeptical of seeing a G rated Disney movie, don't be. It is no less great to kids than it is adult."
1,Doesn't work,"Dead on arrival. Two adapters, one came with the laptop works fine. This one, just received from eforcity does not. I don't see an option to leave feedback on that seller. I wonder why not.RWM"
2,Don't Buy This,This product worked fine for the first month and then it just junked out and now I'm stuck with yet another charger that won't work for my iBook G4. What a waste of money!
2,Cheap 2nd power supply.,"OK if you want a power supply in your bag and one at your desk. Use this one at desk where you are more likely to see the power plug is not plugged in sufficiently to power the computer. Plug gives no indication it is doing it's job and does not plug in solidly. When properly plugged, works. Also wires seem thinly made so I'd not use it as my only supply nor coil it much. Using it, but would not buy again."
1,Damaged my laptop,"The item was defective - instead of recharging my powerbook, it fried the powerbook's dc end board, costing me $150 in repairs. The adapter was clearly cheaply made, and did not come in retail packaging. Luckily, Amazon's return process was painless."
3,"Not disappointed, not blown away . . .","First thing I noticed was how much shorter the overall cable length was compared to the original manufactures equipment. So I find myself needing extension cords if I wish to operate the laptop while still plugged in.Secondly, the connection from the PowerBook to the cable is noticably looser than the OME. Not so much as to warrant a return/replacement, but looser nonetheless.Despite the aforementioned drawbacks, the unit performs as intended."
2,"Worked for 3 months, don't waste your money.","Worked great when I first bought it. Then died after about 3 months of use. I tried another generic adapter next, thinking that it was just this product that was bad. That one died shortly thereafter as well. Don't waste your money on a generic adapter - the $80 mac one will end up costing less in the long run."
4,Cheaper Works great,I bought this charger because obviously the apple's charger is more expensive. I've had it for a month and no flaws. Im a little disappointed that it heats up very quickly and that it has no indicator light on the rim of the plug but it does have a green light on the brick. For the cost its great.
2,Doesn't last long,"It worked really well for about 6 months. But as of now, its fizzing and sparking. I'm in the market for another power adaptor yet again."
4,Solid and cheap replacement but interferes with other cables sometimes,"I bought this a few months ago and for the most part works well. Connections seem solid and the cable looks beefy enough that it won't pull apart easily.However, now when I plug my JBL Creature Speakers into my Powerbook while the adapter is plugged in I get a faint but noticeable low hum coming out of my speakers. Also, if I try to change the volume w/ the touch buttons on the speakers it makes a buzzing noise instead and won't adjust. I recently discovered that by keeping the power adapter cable away from my audio out cables, the problem goes away! I don't have this problem with any other power cables such as for my external monitor, hard drive, etc.So as long as I can keep my power cable separated from my speaker cables I have nothing to complain about with this power adapter."
2,Dead after 2 months :(,"Pros: worksCons: works for only 2 months :( When you get it in your hand, you will realize that it's not a product built to last."
4,Works well for less,"When my original power cord got bent after my laptop fell off the coffee table I needed to get a new one. I had a hard time adjusting to not having the light indicator on the replacement cord. The first one had to be in a very specific place for it to make a good contact after the fall. It's not an issue for me, but the cables are stiffer. It's been working out pretty well and for a better price."
4,pleased,"so far so good. it's not as well made as the original apple one, but for the price, this is an exceptional value."
1,stopped working after 48 hours,"I purchased this product because it was cheaper than the apple replacement charger. It worked fine for two days, and then sparked, began smoking, and stopped working. I have not yet got around to returning it, but hopefully that process will not be too difficult."
2,Was disappointed,"It was slightly clunky and too short, but the real problem is that it stopped working 2 months after I bought it. Truly disappointing."
4,Good and Cheap,"the power-cord works just fine, no LCD light which isn't a big issue. fits just as well as Mac's original but seems a little sturdier. for its price it works great :)"
4,Great product,"This product is well built, work well, and completely satisfies my need.It does not have the light up ring, or an LED power indicator, however I haven't found those to be necessary any way.I am very happy with this product."
1,Crap,Worked for less than 3 months. Now my computer is dead again and I'll have to find a new charger.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,This waste of money charger took a dump just 4 weeks after purchased. And the seller would not warranty it.
4,great inexpensive replacement iBook charger,A sales person in the Apple Store near my house recommended I go on the internet to buy a replacement Power Adapter for my iBook G4. The APPLE version is $79. I paid $10 + $2 shipping for mine.Great idea! Great buy!!
1,DOA,Charger did not work at all when received. Fortunately Amazon's return policy is straightforward and I was able to order another charger that works.
2,littleb,"this item is great! seller sent it quickly and it works THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT, THIS ITEM FAILED AFTER A SHORT TIME. SAD THAT THIS HAPPENED, WILL TRY TO CONTACT SELLER."
1,Dead on Arrival,"The charger for a PowerBook G4 (Al) proved to be utterly useless.Absolutely no sign of life!Tested with a Volt-Ohm meter to be sure and the test confirmed that it is indeed DEAD!Unfortunately, there is no 0 star to rate this product more accurately. My advice at this point can only be to STAY AWAY from it!"
4,works well,"Works well, and does show up as 65W in the System Profiler in my 17"" G4. Only issue is that the connector between the AC cable and the transformer box is not quite as tight as I'd like--it comes out slightly too easily. On the other hand, the connection between the DC cable and my PowerBook is much better than in the case of the Apple adaptor (which had also frayed and so it was time to replace)."
5,Powerbook G4 Aluminium 17'',Works flawless! I have had no problems and it looks better than the apple one I definetly reccomend it for anyone who is looking to replace their 65W power supply from apply for the G4 series powerbooks and iBooks... even used it on a old iBook I had for a try and it worked great on that one too!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Not even worth the cheap price!,"We purchase 3 of these for my wife and my PowerBook G4 Aluminum and after a few weeks, one of them died. Also, none of them wake the computers up from sleep after the battery has completely drained - we have to plug into my wife's remaining Apple power adapter. I didn't return because I didn't even feel like it would be worth the shipping for my time to deal with these.Pay the extra $15 to $20 to get an Apple power adapter - you definitely get what you pay for!"
2,Cheap Quality,"I purchased this charger about a month ago and already the unit that plugs into my powerbook is bent. I have to really play with it in order to get it to work. THe cord is definately thicker than the one made by apple, which was my reason for replacing my original power cord, the apple one had freyed. This is the second replacement cord I have purchased and the other one I bought lasted for almost a year - I had the same problem with that one as well - the unit that plugs into my powerbook became stretched and bent and would not stay in my powerbook. I never had that problem with my genuine apple charger.Not all chargers are the same that are purchased under this review. I also purchased a charger from another seller and it looks a little different, but I have yet to use it since I just recieved it today. I would say the if you purchase the one from brilliantstore I wouldn't get it. I have contacted them to ask for a replacement."
2,"Works, But Forget About Listening To Music","The deal with this is, yes, it will work and yes it is cheaper than buying Apple's overpriced replacement, however, if you plan on listening to any music with your laptop while plugged into this adapter you can forget it. Through laptop speakers it is fine, but through headphones or external speakers it will generate a very annoying hum due to the fact that it is not a grounded power supply (it has a 2 prong plug rather than three). I record music and found it nearly impossible, as it would pick up the hum from the adapter. And because my battery is nearly depleted, I could only record for a few minutes at a time, recharge and then repeat. If you are thinking about this product, I would just rip up a $20 bill or buy a grounded, Apple authorized replacement."
2,Better than nothing?,"Well, it's not the cutie lil charger that comes with the ibook, but it'll get you by for a little while, and when you have to replace it within six months you'll be glad you didn't pay $75 for the one on macstore, which lasts about the same amount of time. Honestly, when is someone going to figure out a way to make these LAST? This is my second replacement! The original died due to the flimsy little cable wearing clean through at the point where it bends away from the insertion tip, and the second just....died. Little blue light went out and that was it. Really, these things totally bite, so you might as well get the cheapest one you can, and before you spend your time on a mad search of eBay, macstore, etc. you should know there are only three or four different types out there, including the WAY too expensive original, and this really is the cheapest you'll find."
1,bad customer service,"reall bad customer service. I called the company to get more information on a product no one answer for a week. I finally go a hold of someone, they told me that they don't carry the product that it was spouse to be in stock per amazon. they advice me to by 45 watt, which I couldn't find in amazon site. when I called back, they told me they don't carry that one either. My whole experience with this company made me very suspecious of them. I don't see them as a realable company."
1,Hit or miss,"I purchased one of these AC adapters over a year ago and it is still working great; I have no complaints with that one. Recently I purchased another one because of the good luck I had with the first one, but the luck ran out. The adapter I received did not work from day one. I returned it and order a replacement adapter which again did not work at all. After returning the second defective adapter I decided it was better to just spend a few extra bucks and get the adapter from Apple."
2,not worth the money,it holds charge but takes an hour to gain a 1% battery life. kind of makes it pointless of having a laptop. would of given it a 1 star but at least it keeps my powerbook alive
2,Lasted a year... that's it.,this power adapter lasted one year and then kaput! It was DEAD! So... just be aware of it's life span. Also the overall length of the full length of the chord is shorter than I liked.
4,charger for Mac powerbook,I purchased this Mac charger unit for my laptop computer. I have to say the cost is unbeatable and the regular costs for this charger from a MAC store is 3 times as much. It works great and I would buy another charger from this manufacturer. I am very pleased.
2,"Another too short adapter, doesn't match product photo","Here we have yet another replacement powerbook adapter that the cord is too short on. With cabling being so cheap, it's a wonder that most of the knock-off companies don't bother trying to match the original Apple adapters for length of cord.Bigger problem for me personally though was that the picture clearly shows a 2-prong plug, while the one I received has a 3-prong plug with ground. This doesn't work at all for where I need to use the adapter, I would not have purchased it if I'd thought it was a 3 prong, but the product image clearly shows a 2-prong plug."
2,Low budget movie using the same scenes to often,"This low budget independent film had some very good acting, but the story is weak. Trying to ID the good guys and bad guys left me to think they were all bad. I kept thinking that this was shot in the woods behind the house of one of the financial backers to save money! Also, the premise of looking for a wife that is far removed from her home area, without a more complete ID, does not click for me, nor does the ""secret message"". The movie did fill the time and had some action but something about the flow of action was missing.I would rent it, but purchase might be a push. In passing, all the ""End of the world"" movies, starting with Water World, kept me wondering where they get their gas, parts and repair. Someday I would like that addressed in one of these movies."
3,Very so-so,"This book wasn't too useful and the only reason I got it was for a class. I shouldn't have bought it, and instead borrowed it from the library the very few times I actually used it. A lot of what the chapters try to ""teach"" you is common sense, and there is the occasional information that is actually useful. A very so-so book, I've had worse texts. Before purchasing, find out if you can borrow it from your school library instead, and save yourself some money."
3,Nice Cleanser But....,"For the price, I think I will just stick with a cleanser that is just as effecive yet less expensive such as St. Ives...."
1,not happy,Not the pump in the picture it has a cheap plastic twist on top . it doesn't have the three screws in the top.I would have bought the cheaper one
3,Maybe All I Should Be Allowed,"I really have enjoyed Elton John's great songs for quite a long time. Nevertheless, there is always one track that falls just under the middle of the road in his longtime career. His track, All That I'm Allowed, the second single from his 2004 record Peachtree Road, is a very soulful song that really sings out very well for awhile. Afterwards, it just loses its luster. The song is alright for those who enjoy Elton's adult contemporary side, but others might just want to consider ignoring this track and go with other Elton John greats. Some may feel that it is in that direction, but others might go the opposite way. Listen to the track in whole from Peachtree Road, and decide for all that you want allowed.Song: C 1/2+"
5,A historic and valuable read for any literary fiction collection,"Much insight of the time can be gained through a novel, and ""Kyra Kyralina"" is no different. Written in the 1920s by Panait Istrati, Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno translate this Romanian work which gave rise in Eastern Europe to the Modernist writing of the time, also providing a literary picture of a Romania separated from the Ottoman Empire. ""Kyra Kyralina"" is a historic and valuable read for any literary fiction collection."
2,Superb!,Wow. I did not know that Romania has such great literature. An American friend recommend it to me. I loved it!
5,Great picture hangers,I love these picture hangers. They are the right size and are nice and sharp. I have plaster walls and hammering in regular nails just makes the wall crumble without the nail going further in. These work great.
2,Not effective and causes acne,"After using this product for nearly a month, I see no improvement in fine lines or elasticity, however, I now have acne. The product feels great when you apply it, but you awake to very dry skin. In addition, I have developed acne. I know new products can cause acne, but typically after a week it clears up. The acne did not clear up for me. I plan to throw out or use on my hands instead... then go back to neutrogena products. I am also using the day shift and don't know which is causing the acne, but I assume both are."
4,SMOOVE IS THE WORD.......,"This is a cd that I had when it came out on vinyl back in the days. It's a really hot cd. I'm surprised that it didn't get much more play than it did. The main cut ""All about her"" is worth the price of the cd alone. Then the hit fast track ""scratch my back"" can carry it's own weight also. Peace, and hope this swayed your decision if you want a nice cd that was forgotten in the cracks that actually was worth buying."
5,themack07,This is one of the greatest r&b cds of all time. All about her is a cut that didnt get enough airtime.Footprints hits so hard its ridiculous man im glad I finally found it . It took me 3 years of searching and now im bumping it again like it just came out.
3,slightly better than a sharp stick in the eye!,"well, its not as good as a good FullHouse episode it still ranks up their in the top ten plays I've ever read, allthough so will the next two i read because of my only reading eight to this point. I was forced to read this for english and I don't believe that Brecht achieved his big goal of not having emotion evoked by his works, because Kattrin's banging on the drum is pretty tear jerking if you ask me, allthough it would be more sad if we didn't know it was allready gonna' happen. Wel I'm just wastin' time because I'm supposed to be writing an essay on this right now, so read it, only if you like to read."
3,Mother Courage and her dead children,"I found this play, although interesting, to fully satisfy the alienation that Brecht intended to place upon his audience. It was somehow very difficult to feel any really emotion except disdain, and perhaps hatred, towards Mother Courage herself, and this was not helped by her continual hipocracy and mecurial nature. I would have prefered something perhaps slightly more aimed at providing a satisfying read (or show) for the audience, and somehow found ""Mother Courage"" rather depressing and horrid. She is a symbol for everything wrong with the world and I hope that I never come across anyone of similar moral or ethical values."
4,great feet warmers!!,"I bought these for myself a while back just as a ""just because"" gift. I am pleased to have these slippers. The reason I only give it a 4/5 review is simply because of the fact that I have many other items I LOVE!!! But yeah, this ad seems confusing because it only states that you get the pink slippers, which I was afraid of. Fortunately, you do get both the pink pair and the team color pair. They are warm and comfortable. Great product."
1,BAD REVIEW,THESE DIAPERS WERE NOT GOOD.....MY GREAT GRANDSON BROKE OUT INTO A RASH WHEN HE WORE THESE. MOST OF THE PACKAGE HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE THEM AGAIN. I ALSO PURCHASED THE SAME DIAPERS FOR MY GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE DEVELOPED A BAD RASH ALSO.....SHE HAD TO BE TREATED BY A DOCTOR FOR IT. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THESE DIAPERS THAT THE BABIES ARE ALLERGIC TO. I WILL NOT BUY THESE AGAIN....WILL PAY MORE FOR THE NAME BRANDS OR WAIT UNTIL NAME BRANDS ARE IN STOCK.
2,Cheap leaking diapers,"Bought it, thought a nice deal, they cheap, but they are leaking, plain, not money saver at all."
1,Don't buy these diapers!,I thought this was a great deal but these diapers are the worst. We had to change my son about every 90 minutes so he wouldn't leak through. They are poor quality and we ended up throwing them away. Don't waste your money!
1,Diapers consistently leak,"I've used off-brand diapers before (e.g. Wal-Mart, Target, and White Cloud) and found them to be moderately effective. However, I've been thoroughly disappointed with this purchase. They leak just about every other change. In fact, if our baby pees in them more than once, its for sure going to wet through to his clothes. If he has any sort of bowel movement, then it's a complete mess. If you want to buy a cost-effective diaper consider those from Luvs. They have a leak guard guarantee and are somewhat cheaper than Pampers and Huggies. However, I would definitely not purchase these because they are absolutely worthless."
1,They leak!,"I bought them because they were cheap, but they leak BAD! Spend a little more on Luvs and get much diapers. I wouldn't buy these again no matter how cheap the price."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad bookVery text heavy though and operates best as a reference book than anything else. CD that comes with it is useful.You can work through this book over a weekend and get a firm grasp on CSS fundamentals. Not inspiring though, just handy."
5,Best Tech Book I Own,"With a bookshelf of unread and semi-read tech books, this is the first technical book I can honestly say I read from cover to cover, and reference on a very regularly basis.It's written in an easy to understand, easy to follow manner, that allows you to ""get"" what she's talking about rather than just stare at the page. Everything is example based, and there's no fluff.With a little time, you can create a very professional, custom website using the examples in this book, (and you can download the code, so you don't even have to retype it)."
2,Mostly basic info for pure beginners,"Unless you are a complete beginner to CSS, you will probably be as disappointed with this book as I was. I am no expert on CSS having done only a few pages with it, but I already felt that I was beyond the level of this book. It does have some useful tips and techniques, but not very many that are beyond what is readily available with free on-line tutorials that can be found by googling. It also frequently takes several pages to explain basic topics that need no more than a page. Except for the few notes I've taken from the book, I doubt that I'll refer to it much."
1,Description is not accurate,"The item description is not correct. This is not as much a fault of Amazon.com, as it is Sitepoint - the publisher of the book. If you are thinking you will be receiving a full-colored book, you will be disappointed. The only color this book contains is on the covers. The entire text and body of the book is in black and white. The book is not ""published in full color"" as the description states. The remedy of this by Sitepoint (the publisher of the book) is for you to ship it back to Amazon for a refund, even though they are the ones providing the inaccurate description to Amazon. I will never purchase a book from Sitepoint again, given they cannot maintain accurate descriptions of what they are selling. The description is inaccurate on their website, and on Amazon."
5,A Great Guide to Get You Started in CSS!,Check out the sites I designed using this book as a reference: http://rainiersupply.com and http://tudorwebdesign.com .
4,About The CSS Anthology,Great book for beginners and intermediates. I most liked the material on rounded corners and two and three column formats.
1,Beginner's Book and not a good one,"This is a book for beginners. If you have knowledge of CSS or if you have read other books on CSS, you probably already know what is in this book. I found it to be too text heavy and too simple. Also, other CSS books cover the same information better and in less space...""Stylin' with CSS"" comes to mind. Also, I would fault the author for not having any CSS dropdown menus. She says only javascript menus will do, but never says why. Yet, there are plenty of good CSS only dropdowns on the internet. My advice, save your money and get either Stylin' with CSS or CSS The Missing Manual or any Eric Meyer book."
4,The CSS Anthology: 101 Essential Tips,"For a few years now I have been maintaining a web site set up by someone else that used a minimum of CSS properties. It is now time to make the site over and I found myself with a lot of questions about how to use more CSS properties to make the site fully compliant with the W3C standards.The author does a very good job of breaking things down and making it much easier to understand. I'm not someone that likes to just copy someone else's work so I need to know the why's, as much as the how's to getting things done. This book is not my only source, but it definitely helped me to understand CSS properties much more."
4,Great Book! I'm a beginner!,This book has opened my eyes to the world of css. 101 has enabled me to update my site and have few problems. 101 has been a great reference and this book will always be near my computer. Now I need to find a great mysql book for beginners.
4,"Tips, tricks and hacks","You have to already know and understand CSS. There is a small introduction, but after that, 101 ""How do I..?"" Perfect book if you are alredy familiar with the subject."
4,Very helpful book,"I am a web designer by career. And when our company began moving into CSS, I thought I'd better find some good books. This one was fantastic. It's filled with a lot of examples and tricks that not only taught me about CSS at a level I could quickly grasp, but it also provided examples that I could actually pull and use in my projects.I own other sitepoint books such as ""The Principles of Beautiful Web Design"" and ""CSS the Ultimate Reference"" and they are all fantastic. I'm beginning to think that sitepoint is a great source for knowledge. I recommnend this book highly."
4,Very good for the beginner.,After reading this book it has made it a lot simpler to understand the commands and the structure of CSS. If you are new to this read from cover to cover and you will have a better understanding of CSS.
1,Buy CSS: The Missing Manual instead of this,"CSS: The Missing Manual by David Sawyer McFarland is a much better book on correct usage of CSS, and is written by a much more respected author. Also, this book is not full-color as the description says it is. I guess no one has bothered taking the time to update the description."
5,Delightfully Simple. Really.,"If you like books that combine images with easy-to-understand instructions, Publishing a Blog with Blogger is for you.This book is a no-nonsense guide to begin blogging fast and easy. I have three blogs, and this book taught me more about starting and making simple changes than I've read anywhere else.I especially appreciate Chapter 3's information on blogging by phone or Email and numerous ideas on customizing your blog space. This book focuses on the Blogger platform; however, the tips are usable on any type of blog.Get this book if your goal is to create a blog with minimum effort and maximum results."
4,Great book.,"I love the Visual Quick Start series, and this book is no exception. It has jump starred my blog and I feel it is worth keeping around for hints and questions that come up. I wasn't sure if the book being published a few years ago would still be relevant but it is."
3,"Great Book, Needs Updating","As others have attested, this is an excellent beginning guide. It is clear and easy to understand, in large part due to the screen shots and non-technical language. It is definitely an entry-level book.What was lacking for me was that Blogger has just moved to a new version so the interface for editing much of the code in templates and other helps has changed. This will be a challenge for a relative beginner such as myself.For just getting the basics, this is a great book, but keep in mind that there are changes to Blogger since it was printed."
4,Learn to Blog Really Fast,"I bought several books on blogging because I'm scheduled to teach a class about blogging at our library in late October. This little guide is the perfect teaching tool. Although it only covers one blog host, blogger.com, most of the information can be used with any host."
4,easy to follow visual guide,"Castro gives us a very visual guide to using Blogger. The pages are mostly colourful diagrams. Screen shots of example blogs being made with Blogger, with markups annotating how these were produced. Enough detail is presented to let you make up your blog site with the usual features common to many blogs. Like having links to earlier postings. Or letting a blogger add her photo to her profile, and describing information about her like what region she hails from.The book should be a quick read."
3,No longer relevant,"Elizabeth Castro is one of the best tech authors out there. Her book on HTML (HTML, XHTML, and CSS, Sixth Edition (Visual Quickstart Guide)) is an absolute classic and belongs in every serious techie's library.However, this book on using Google Blooger dates from 2005 and is seriously outdated. The newcomer will be much better served byGoogle Blogger For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))which has just been released.Blogger's interface has changed considerably since the time Castro's book was published and a newcomer might not be able to easily understand the differences. ""Google Blogger for Dummies"" also offers somewhat more depth.""Publishing a Blog with Blogger"" was good for its time, but its time is past.Jerry"
4,good punk rock,"check these guys, they're pretty damn good. great songs with some smart lyrics and nice melodies."
5,Arm & Hammer Cat Litter Deodorizer Power,I have used this product for many years. I use a shaker to sprinkle it in the litter box and it gives my cat's litter a pleasant smell between changes.
3,its ok...,I had to use a lot of it for it to even work so it only lasted a week. if your hoping for a longer lasting remedy this is not it...
5,Good Ideas,"Reading this book will give one some needed ideas in reclaiming inactive members.Some of the ideas espoused in this book are old ideas, yet made new and fresh for our time. If one reads with an open mind, one can gain great knowledge, and as in all things, if there are areas not useful, then use the adage, ""eat the meat, spit out the bones."
5,A Beginner's Herb-Growing Bible!,"I happened to run across (and purchase) this book when I was first researching herb growing. Boy, did I luck out!This beautifuly arranged and designed book, is a wonderful resource for rookie herbalists/gardeners. Topics include the selecting and growing of herbs, harvesting and preserving herbs, and creating gifs and recipes with herbs. Each bit of instruction is followed by an informative set of pictures or diagrams. Thanks to this book I was able to grow and harvest my first potted herb garden -- and make some pretty tasty herb butter to boot.I would caution experienced gardeners and herbalists against purchasing this book, as it will most likely be too basic for them.Before I end this, though, here's a gift idea that I made for a friend as a housewarming gift. Wrap up this book along with a tiny garden shovel, gloves, potting soil, clay pots, and seeds. She/he will be delighted!"
2,Better to go with Nylon,"I got his for my boyfriend to go with his code reader, but it's very cheaply made. The plastic clasp that anchors it shut feels like it's going to snap off. I was very disapointed, better to purchase the nylon case, it's a little more in price but worth it."
1,Not good case,"I think this in not a good produt. The tittle is storage case for a 3100 obd II code reader, but is just a simple plastic box. I am not going to buy anything from midway. I paid 18.99 for a platic box. It's too much."
1,Software CD missing.,"The seller, Lighthouse Media in Tracy Iowa, only sent me the manual. Before I bought the product he confirmed all 3 installations were still available but the software CD didn't arrive. Upon contacting him, he couldn't find it to supply it. Amazon refunded my money promptly. So needless to say, I can not provide a review for this product."
2,One good song on the whole album,"With the exception of ""Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off,"" which is a funny, catchy tune, the rest of this album is so sad, sappy and depressing it will make you wonder how the heck he came up with ""Tequila."""
4,Not much of a country fan but.....,"I like some country, but I'm more of a rock & roll girl. I have to admit that I am now a huge fan of Joe Nichols. I love most of the songs on this CD. The videos on CMT are awesome. And....the combination of tequila and Bon Jovi always make my clothes fall off. LOL"
4,No Revelation But a Good Album,"Joe Nichols' new album, III is another great set of songs from the traditional country artist. This 11 song set has quite a few ""standouts"", highlighted by Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off. I'll Wait For You, Talk Me Out of Tampa, That's What Love Will Get Ya, Honky Tonk Girl, and Just a Little More are the other top songs on this compilation. It doesn't quite measure up to the outstanding ""Revelation"", his previous album, but still a solid piece of work. Joe Nichols' traditional country sound and great voice will keep him around country music and keep him in the ranks of it's top stars for years to come."
2,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:he actually co-wrote two of the songs,has a good feel,good songs,an Al Perkins appearance on one song,bad side:almost too close to being a manufactured country artist, less pin-up looking pictures inside and more songwriting skills should be exercisedstandout tracks:talk me out of tampa; as country as she gets; should i go home (or should i go crazy)"
5,I laughed so hard I fell off my chair!!!!,I laughed so hard I fell off my chair!!! But honestly these 46 films are very funny and intelligent. Some are socio-political and some are outrageous so be warned! But some are just darn funny!!! If you have SNL and Mad TV humor you have to watch these!! This Anderton guy is up and coming and is going to BREAK into the film world so make sure you have a copy of YOUR DVD. When he makes it BIG you can e-bay this DVD for more money. Ha ha.
3,Love Betty Boop...but...,"First of all, I wouldn't call this a Nurse's bag. There are no organizers for stethescopes, scissors, etc like my old bag that I was replacing since I wore it out, plus it is much smaller than I thought that it would be. It is a cute little bag, but I think it may be relegated to a weekend or gym bag as it really isn't functional for what I need in to carry the tools of my trade."
5,Fantastic collection of short stories,"TMEC is a very interesting collection of short stories which all deal with the lives and experiences of the customers in the cantina. Learn the truth about Greedo, discover why the Sand People hate humans, learn how Han Solo's Kessel-run-record was broken by BoShek, and know why the cantina band ""don't do weddings"". It's a good book and most of the stories are very well composed."
5,A really good book,I thought this book was interesting. It told little stories about things that happened in the cantina. I really enjoyed all the stories.
4,This book deserves 4.5 stars!,This is much better than Bounty Hunters.But some of the stories stunk.Overall it was good.
4,A fun set of stories.,"I bought the Kindle version, because my paper copy had fallen apart. A good set of stories, by a good set of authors."
3,Han So So,"I am just in the begining stages of starwars geekery. The only other starwars book i have read is the first book of the Thrawn Trilogy. I really enjoyed the read, so while I eagerly waited for book two to arrive in the mail, I picked up this book from the local bookstore.There are only a handful of engaging stories here. It maybe be worth while to some to tediously consume the other strories just to have some trivia knowledge. I may enjoy knowing interesting tidbits about the cantina back story, but the number of boring stories I had to read was not a price I enjoyed paying. Get this book from your library and read about greedo, the sisters, the Devorean, and maybe a few more. Maybe it's just the short story format, but I could not get into 80% of the stories."
4,Great Book!,"Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina is a great book. It moves quickly and sure-footedly. Teh short stories are great, the interweaving characters reminded me a little of a less metaphoric version of the Sound and the Fury (less the three page long sentences), and all the stories were told with action, suspense, and humor. I particularly enjoyed Het Nkik's tale. This is a great book for even the most casual fan of Star Wars, and a must read for those hardcore ones."
3,The place for Jazz...,"Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina is the most enjoyable Star Wars book in print. It tells the stories of all the characters you only glanced at and never got to know. Find out about Greedo and the Band, and many other characters. The best part is that every story, though written by separate authors, is interrelated and directly correlates to all the others. Overall, a very good read."
4,Overall Good Book.,"Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina is a great book for any Star Wars fanatic, like myself. The stories were detailed enough so you got a good visual picture, but not so much as to make a novel. One or two stories were a little hard to understand such as the one on the pipe smoker. I really like the fact that this adds more of a personal touch to the broad expanse of the Star Wars universe. Anyone interested in knowing more about the stories between ""The Story"" this would be a good book for you. May the Force be with you in all your Star Wars readings. *Feel free to drop me a line about anything!"
1,Amazon needs to get their facts straight,"I ordered Noir Desir's Dies Irae from Amazon because the product description explicitly stated that the DVD was zoned for the US and Canada. This ended up not being the case, so now I can only watch it on a laptop and not on my TV as it won't work in my DVD player. As such, I was completely unsatisfied with this order, and would caution other buyers when Amazon makes claims about similar products."
5,Takes me back in time,Words of wisdom.people need to read and live a little like Mr Wilson states in his book of childhood stories. Brings back fond memories of childhood stories.
3,Another fan of Craig Wilson,"I just love ""It's the Little Things"" and have enjoyed reading its columns over and over again. I have given more than 20 copies as gifts on various occasions. I recently heard Craig Wilson reading from his book and found him just as charming in person as on paper."
3,"""Only Memories Lingered...""","A nice 'beach read' - somewhere between Dave Barry & Garrison Keillor.Never too deep - and Wilson tends to use a stock of phrases, turns & expressions throughout his writing that allow one short story to flow right into the next -I can see this as a weekly column - where the time between reading articles would be spaced out. Side-by-side, these stories sometimes read like revised versions of the story just before it in the book. Nothing too deep or original - just very well-rounded and nostalgic.""Vicki's Funeral"" is a standout for me from the entire collection.As another reader put it - snuggle up and feel good with this book."
3,A nice little read - nothing spectacular,"If you like his column you'll enjoy this book. It's so small, however, it's really more like a large brochure."
4,Balcony People,"This is a nice little book to share with people in your life that are positive and uplifting influences. I bought several copies to give to special friends as gifts. I received a copy as a gift myself and after reading it I wanted to ""pay it forward"" to others."
5,affirmation is a great thing,"Balcony People is about the people in your life that lift you up. There are 2 different kinds of people: Balcony People and Basement People. You can guess what Basement People do to you - they pull you down, cut you down, and cause heartache. This book is about Balcony People and how they are a blessing in our lives, and how we need to let the people who ARE our Balcony People know that they are Balcony People."
5,Understanding the Nature of God's Love.,"Excellent book that helped me to become an encourager to other people. Explains the difference between evaluators(basement people) and encouragers(balcony people). Explains how to use the power of God's love to identify and heal emotional damage caused by critical people in yourself and how to help others suffering the same damage. Shows how to identify the encouragers in your life(and in scripture) and gives examples on how you can be in someone elses ""balcony"". I read this book once a year to help me in my ongoing quest to become a more compassionate and caring person. A beautifully written guide that carries you into the loving arms of God."
4,Short but Sweet,"Balcony People is a short simple little book. Its an easy fast read. It instructs us how treat others as we want and need to be treated.HH the Dali Lama put it succinctly when he said ""My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness."" Joyce Landorf Heatherley tells us how to do it.It is a reminder of how to love ourselves and each other as God loves us."
1,Tired and Tiring,"This lengthy first novel begins promisingly: a New Zealand historian based in Tokyo disappears, and the subject of his research -- Japan's murky wartime past -- is potentially explosive.But the writer's attempts to incorporate cross-cutting and other hallmarks of postmodern cleverness are merely that: clever. They fail to achieve any greater effect, and as you read on, you begin to smell the rat: the writer's inability to resolve narrative dilemmas, to develop any characters or even a voice that will cast a spell strong enough to warrant the narrative game-playing. The prose piles detail upon detail without finding its soul, and the writer has neither the intellectual heft nor insight of David Mitchell, nor the warmth and sensitivity of Haruki Murakami, both of whom seem to hover distantly above and beyond this book. The characters, both Japanese and others, are fatuous and flat.I am a lover of long books, but finishing this one was a chore."
1,Choice Theory,Content is good but poor presentation hinders one's reading and enjoyment of the text. Poorly laid out- insufficient headings etc. poor quality paper.
1,Pseudoscientific hyperbole,"I've tried reading this book several times, but always end up putting it down. The author strains the limits of my credulity when he states that so many health conditions from stomach aches to arthritis, are caused by the body's ""creative systems"" and that they are related directly to the breakdown of a personal relationship. Gimme a break, doc! This idea has been around for years, and has yet to be proven by science. This book is harmful!"
1,psycho babble,this book held a lot of promise until i read it.i should have known when i saw a blurb by schuller on the back.just so much garbage.soon to be forgotten.
1,Drivel,"You too could be a famous psychologist! Simply write a book full of opinion and untested theory.Try Steven Hayes, Howard Rachlin, or if you are into schools, try the Morningside Model by Kent Johnson, these people have evidence to show that their psychologies work. Don't buy into the warm fuzzy feeling books like this promise."
4,Must have if you believe in Choice Theory,"I have read other books of Dr. Glasser such as Control Theory, CT in the Classroom, Reality Therapy, Staying Together, and Quality Schools. So there are several things and ideas already covered in his previous books when you read this latest book of Glasser. To me, it is a bit too long and winding. I am sure it can be done or written more concisely (like Staying Together). However, I enjoyed reading most chapters. If you believe in his theory, you would find this book a good reference. In fact, you don't need to read all his other books."
3,Choice Theory,"I found this book a bit ambiguous. I had hoped for more information on what was ment by choices. The concept is promising but the book fell short of it's objective to really inform. If you are a first time buyer of William Glasser books I would suggest another of his books first. ""Take Charge of your Life: How to get What You Need with Choice-Theory Psychology"" This book may be a better CHOICE."
4,Very Good!,"This book is about the fact most people blame others for what happens on their life, their health mental and physical instead of taking personal responsibility. As a consequence, mental illnesses attack. The author considers it is possible to heal from this kind of illness just when the patient decides so. This book teaches and helps the patient how to realize what is causing the illness and then the brain by itself start a healing process that not only heal the patient by also the others around the patient (family and friends) causing a healing circle of wellness."
5,william glasser outdoes himself with this book,"as a professional with graduate training and a psychiatric background of 25 years I have followed Dr. Glasser since 1976 when I fortunately picked up his reality therapy in the university library. I have been hooked ever since and actually had the priviliege of attending one of his recent toronto workshops last year and saw the brillant man in person. Wonderful message, great insight and it works too!!"
4,"Good reality therapy book, but some some limitations","Good reality therapy book, easy to understand, plenty of good examples of choice therapy, but I don't agree with everything author says regarding depression and emotional disorders (author believes medicating these serious problems with brain chemistry altering drugs is not necessary, which I believe is inhumane and counterproductive to the health and well being of many patients). Reality and choice therapy is a highly practical, effective, easy to utilize counseling technique that can resolving many of life's problems. I do agree with about 80 percent of what author says, but I just don't think you can rely solely on reality therapy techniques for all of life's emotional and psychological problems."
5,Amazing and encyclical,I worked with the immense vocabulary list and scored in the 99th percentile. This is THE book for English language skill-building at any price.
