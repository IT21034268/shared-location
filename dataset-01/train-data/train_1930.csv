5,Good Book.,This book is really helpful. I really like the way it's set up. Nothing but happy customers here.
1,The dude plays with flat hands!,"The greatest deficiancy in Helfgott's pianism is the fact that he plays with flat hands (in the English tradition) as opposed to round hands (in the Bach tradition - the preferred mode for great pianists). Flat hands severely restrict what you can do on the keyboard, and this shows in the recording. This CD comes in nice packaging with all kinds of impressive photos so that the uninitiated audience might actually buy it (thinking that it is good). Do not be fooled! The only reason Helfgott is so famous is because he poses a Holywood story: a psychotic individual with personal problems who transcended his illness through art."
2,Clapped-out pianola,"I recently heard Freddy Kempf play this piece in Leeds Town Hall and was completely blown away. For some odd reason, Mr Kempf has not yet deemed his performance worthy of a CD release, so I though, (maybe carried away with the hype from 'Shine') that David Helfgott might do this piece justice (I particulary enjoyed his rendition of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 on 'Brilliantissimo').How wrong I was. The climax of the first movement is absolutely ruined by bum notes, such that the performance sounds as if Helgott was replaced by a four-year-old playing on a clapped-out pianola.And coundn't the piano have been miked up so that you can't hear Helfgotts heavy breathing/miscellaneous noises? It's extremely distracting and adds nothing to the performance."
1,...,"Despite the rather poor quality of his performance here, I think we should all give poor David Helfgott a break! Why did this recording stink so much?!?! WATCH SHINE!! The unfortunate soul spent years in and out of mental institutions, and was perceivably out of practice for as many years. Criticize him negatively if you must; I must say I do not understand how anyone could put down something like Mr. Helfgott. I think David is simply an angel with tired wings. Please don't give him a hurricane to fly through."
1,Just another bad record...,"Let's be serious and face up to the facts: bad records come in hundreds every year. Helfgott's disastrous rendition of Rach 3 may be even worse than the usual clumsy products released by major labels, but it's in no way exceptional as a phenomenon - fraud and bad pianism abound in the market as much as wrong notes on this record. I'd love to see people saving some of their harsh criticism for plenty of supposed masters whose talent depend more on hype and lavish sound engineering than on technique, profoundity and understanding. At least Helfgott has his mental condition as an alibi. If we held many of the much acclaimed pianists who made into the big industry to the same standards we hold Helfgott here at Amazon, or even higher standards since some of them are, mentally speaking, perfectly healthy, the outcome would be deeply discouraging, I guess."
1,This is crap !!!,"If you have some appreciation for Rachmaninoff's work and specially the 3rd concerto, don't buy this. Listen to Horowitz (he has recorded it a lot of times, all of them wonderful), Janis or Kissin for the ones who like it slow, but please don't buy this CD.I'm sorry for Mr.Helfgott, I loved Shine and I think he's a wonderful person, but his playing is awful."
1,Embarrassment to RCA and Classical Music!,"It is really sad when an esteemed label like RCA Red Seal, who has signed artists ranging from Arthur Rubinstein to Evgeny Kissin, signs a contract with an 'artist' (Here, 'artist' is to be interpreted very loosely.) of such low quality! His technique is shoddy at best, and his playing lacks the sonority and tempo that is synonymous with Rachmaninov's Concerto No. 3 in D minor. Instead of this concerto recording, try Mikhail Pletnev, Evgeny Kissin, Martha Argerich, Vladimir Horowitz, and Olga Kern. For the piano sonata, try Vladimir Horowitz and Olga Kern."
5,no matter what they say,"I carrefully read the other reviews and could not understand whhy they did not like this o recording. Most of the argued that Helfgott playing is sloppy, then i advise them to listen Rach 3 from other performers in order to undertand what sloppy means.Rach 3 is the most diffucult piano concerto ever, it requires extreme speed, passion and intelligence and believe or not Helfgott is the only one who could make it. This is the best rach 3 recording i have ever listened."
1,Pitiful,"It's hard to find words to explain how awful this recording is. Obviously one has to feel tremendous sympathy and admiration for Mr. Helfgott as a person and for his courage. Unfortunately his fingers are not up to the music. There are heaps and heaps of missed or wrong notes and a great deal of bizarre sforzandos and tempo changes. At some point in his life he was obviously an excellent pianist and his musicality is good. He actually plays the opening page of the Rach 3 quite beautifully, but the rest of it is best forgotten.It's a very sad recording. Mr. Helfgott is not the first pianist to have had psychiatric problems, nor will he be the last. He sounds like he is playing under the influence of anti-depressants or sedatives, nor is he the first pianist to do that in public. Listening to this is not life-affirming or uplifting. It's depressing and embarrassing."
1,Oh Nooooooooooooooo,"Let's separate the noble struggle of Helfgott the man and the preposterous notion that he can play this masterpiece. He can't. Doesn't even come close. If the novice listener was ""blown away"" by this performance, then it must be by what's left of the music after DH gets through it. Do yourself a favor and listen to a master --- Watts, Ashkenazy, Ortiz, Horowitz, Berman, Argerich, Gilels ---bring out the music here."
5,Better than you think!,"When I found this CD, after seeing the movie 'Shine', I knew I had to have it. I wasn't that familiar with the piano concerto before seeing the movie, and agree that it would be a difficult piece to play. I'm sure there are better recordings of this piece available, but let's look at the circumstances involved with this recording: 1. It's a LIVE recording, and what artist hasn't missed a few notes in a live performance? 2. It's the Copenhagen Philharmonic, a great orchestra in its own right, but not one with a reputation based on name recognition (like the New York Philharmonic.) I'm quite sure these pieces have been played better, but when you consider the source, it's a great performance by an inspirational artist. I especially love track #7, ""Prelude in G minor."""
2,Ummm... C-,"This ""interpretation"" of the Rachmaninoff D-minor played here by Helfgott was my first exposure to all three movements of the concerto. Many times Helfgott seems to throw his hands in the general direction of the notes and is right more than 50% of the time. Buy it for Helfgott, NOT for Rachmaninoff. I wish I could cheaply acquire a few more Rach 3 recordings, especially the Argerich, the two final Horowitzes, any others??"
1,"A greatly hyped, but disappointing performance","This is a very disappointing performance (wildly uneven would be an understatement). Today, I don't expect technical performance weaknesses to take so much away from the musicianship, but in this performance, I have difficulty listening to the musicianship on account of the technical struggles that are so much in evidence (he should have stayed with the simpler 1st movt. cadenza!). I think it is wonderful that Shine may have encouraged so many first timers to listen to classical music, I just wish it could have been to a performance that we could all agree to hold in high esteem."
2,"Unbalanced, Very strange.","What I got when I listened to this disc is that during the hearing I got very, very much worried about that whether he could complete the whole work or not. It sounds very unbalanced and strange. There is no logical sense of the interpretation, no structural feeling. I'm very impressed by David's story, but music is music, I must say sorry."
1,Do not buy this.,"This is an awful, awful recording of Rachmaninof's wonderful work. It is overblown, way way too staccatto in many spots, disjointed, etc. etc. etc. Buy the movie, that's fine: it was a great movie. But do not buy any of his recordings. They are horribly played and are exploitative. I suggest, for the concerto, the Andre Watts recording. As a musician, I am offended that people will make a pity-purchase and get this, while there are many, many young artists putting as much or more work into what they are doing as Mr. Helfgott and being completely ignored by the public. Don't let the media brainwash you!"
1,Davids father was right....,"..he should have stayed on the farm in Australia. The movie got it quite wrong. This CD shows that David completely lacks both technique and worst of all, artistry. I suppose we have to be sensitive to his breakdown, but I want the money back that I totally wasted on this disaster."
4,"Better than ""Something Borrowed""","I read Something Borrowed and I really liked it, but Something Blue is a lot better! It was a page turner for me, and unputdownable..I liked the story line and the ending better. Since I like two of Emily Giffin's novels so far, I'm hoping i'll like the others as well...if not more.."
4,Good Read!,"I must admit, when I first started reading Something Blue, I did not think that I would enjoy it as much as I did Something Borrowed. I was pleased to discover that Emily Giffen did not paint Darcy as some heroine that everyone just misjudged in the previous reading. It was fitting, I thought that Darcy found herself alone from the way she acted. I was also surprised by the depth of the deception with her affair with Marcus.I was a nice change that she left for Europe and made new friends. I also liked that she fell in love with Ethan, especially when in the beginning it looked like it would be a one sided love.I also loved the sequence of events that unfolded at the end of the book between Rachel, Dex, and Darcy. I would recommend this book to anyone who fell in love with Something Borrowed."
3,"slow start and really did end up being ""something blue""","I had just read the first book and was excited for the second. Assuming the second book would be similar to the first, I kept waiting for Rachel's point of view to come through. I was rather disappointed when I realized it was never coming and this was a book about Darcy. Through reading the first book I had grown to empathize with and understand Rachel and I even got frustrated with Darcy. I looked forward to hearing more about Rachel's life in the second book. ""Something Blue"" was not what I had anticipated at all. I kept reading thinking it would become something better - it never did. Even at the end of the book I was expecting more and unfortunately I feel like it never came. The second book just isn't as satisfactory as the first and left me feeling ""something [akin to] blue""."
5,Even better than 'Something Borrowed',"I didn't think I'd like 'Something Blue' because it was written from Darcy's point of view, the character you grow to dislike in 'Something Borrowed.' But by the end of this book I found myself truly liking and relating to Darcy even more than Rachel, and I didn't think that was possible! I would recommend reading Something Borrowed first (and not just seeing the movie - it is not quite the same) and going into this book with an open mind. You'll find yourself going on a journey with all the characters, and it's fun to find out what happens to everyone!"
3,Good quickie read.,"I read this book in two days, mostly because it was more ""soap opera""-like than anything. Was it an ""all time favorite""-no, but I would recommend it to a girlfriend going on vacation.The main character, Darcy, is irritating but loveable and just when you want to slap her, she comes to grips with some valuable life lessons. Yes, I shed a tear during the birth scene, so if you ask if it's tear-worthy I'd have to say ""yes"", in a shallow corny way.I think I might read Griffin's ""Something Borrowed"" next. I like the fact that her writing style is almost like two chatting girlfriends."
2,"Not as good as ""Something Borrowed""","I found ""Something Blue"" to be a poor follow-up to ""Something Borrowed"". Borrowed introduced us to the Sex & the City world of fashion, fun, and love. Blue turns it's back on the very thing that made Borrowed successful, but not to a pleasing conclusion. Darcy's crises are predictable, the resolutions obvious and inevitable. Where Borrowed presented some interesting AND entertaining challenges, Blue seeks to be the made for tv movie that ties everything up in a neat and tidy bow. If you enjoyed Borrowed, I would let the characters live on in your imagination."
2,Disappointing,"The premise of the book was exciting - experiencing the situation through Darcy's point of view, but quickly became disappointing. Although the book shows that people can change, it seems forced and loses its appeal about a third of the way through.It was also frustrating that Darcy never made the connection that her `soul mate' type feelings for Ethan that `she couldn't help' may have been the exact same feelings that Kate and Dex could have had for each other.Wouldn't recommend as a must read, would barely recommend as an `if you have time read'."
1,Keep looking,"If you're looking for a light weight but entertaining novel, keep looking. The main character is so shallow, unappealing and cardboard like that you are at a complete loss to understandwhy any other character in the book can tolerate her.It was a waste of the hour and a half it took to read it."
2,something new... somewhat,"This is the sequel to ""Something Borrowed""... read that one first. If you liked it, then I would recommend this book. It's written in the same style and with the same flair and exuberance.I started reading, prepared to dislike Darcy. However, Emily Griffin successfully narrates her character's journey of growth in a entertaining way which wins you over to the Darcy's plight. It was definitely a predictable (and not too realisitic) story but I still had fun along the way. Actually, I ended up liking this book better than something borrowed because it was less about guilt and more about growth."
2,over hyped!,"This is very, very chick lit light if ever I have read one. And what a contrived ending. I can not believe the high marks."
2,"Good style of writing, lousy message","Basically Emily Giffin sends a horrible message about morality in both her books regarding Darcy and Rachel. She says that if a friendship or relationship is flawed, then it's probable and even acceptable to lie and cheat. Basically your integrity is based on outside influences and not who you are on the inside. For people to sympathize or ally with either Darcy or Rachel makes me really question our society's values."
1,Totally unbelievable and boring,"The main problem with this book is that the lead character, Darcy, was painted in such a negative light in the first book ""Something Borrowed"" that the reader finds it very hard to feel any connection, or empathy with her.In addition, the plot is very weak, with no sense of realism...the whole story is just ridiculous. I don't know why some people are giving this book 5 stars...all I can think is that they must set their bar very low."
5,Great Read,"I love Emily Giffin books. They are quick, easy reads and VERY entertaining. I really liked this book even though it's a bit predictable. I recommend it!"
4,ready for the movie now.,"I loved something borrowed, the movie and the book. I liked that this book was from Darcy's side of things."
1,Something after,I care more for Rachel than Darcy but it was good to hear from Darcy and Rachel and Dex but what about Marcus
5,such a cute story!,"adorable story, easy to read, funny, sweet. likeable characters. only thing that bugged me was that surely a permanent trans atlantic move wouldn'tbe decided from one day to the next with no mention of visas etc. that may be a bit nit picky but ithink even fiction should be realistic. apart from that it's beautiful story."
3,Fairly decent sequel to Something Borrowed,"Literally finished the same day I purchased it. Giffin does an excellent job of wrapping up the events that took place in 'Something Borrowed.' Works very well as stand alone story, even if one had never read Something Borrowed. Quick and easy read. Nice to be in Darcy's head for a change."
5,Good sequel,"If you liked Giffin's ""Something Borrowed"" (the prequel to this book), then you will like Something Blue. In Something Borrowed, you are introduced to Darcy Rhone, a spoiled, shallow woman who cheats on her husband and is cheated on by her husband. I came to hate her in Something Borrowed, but was still interested in reading this novel to follow her journey.In the beginning of this book, Darcy was still very much unlikable, but as her journey progresses, she gradually evolves, as she is now pregnant with twins and alone. I really enjoyed this book and felt that Darcy's evolution was believable and genuine. As with all Giffin's books, this was a quick read and became addicting."
5,Emily Giffin is right up there!,"When I first started reading ""Something Borrowed"", I had already decided that there was no way I was going to like Rachel but few pages into the book and Giffin had me rooting for her and hating her friend Darcy. By the time the book finished, I really disliked her and since ""Something Blue"" is about Darcy, I was skeptical. Well, long before the book finished, I wanted to give Darcy a chance and loved her by the end of it and that is all due to the author's witty writing skill which takes us so naturally into the tranformation of Darcy. I especially loved the ""Steps to becoming a better Darcy!"" This is a beautiful book that you would not want to put down and it evokes the most natural emotions and makes you believe that you too, know someone like Rachel and Darcy. All in all, a very commendable debut for this talented author and please do not miss out on either of her books. You will not be disappointed!"
4,A poignant story of friendship and love,"This was a great story. While the first half of the book was a little hard to get through, the second half more than made up for it. I have not read Something Borrowed and I was therefore unfamiliar with the other side of Rachel and Dex's story. It is hard to like Darcy in the first part of the book but you cant help feeling a little sorry for her. She is extremely self centered. She reminded me of a three year old and I remember thinking that she had some serious growing up to do. In the second part of the book, Darcy comes to realize some of her character flaws and begins trying to become a better person. Ethan was one of the sweetest characters Ive met in a long time. The dynamics of his relationship with Darcy, evolving from friendship to a steadfast love, was down right poignant. It makes you think about life, friendship, and love. That what you think you want for yourself in life is not always what will make you happy."
5,Just a heads up....this book is a sequel.,"First of all I applaud Emily Giffin for coming up with this creative idea for a sequel; not only is it a great story but also a great way to sell books. The characters are well thought out, relatable, and most of all - human.Her writing style is witty and humorous but not over the top. I found it to be enjoyable throughout and as with Something Borrowed; I didn't put it down until I finished reading it. In fact, I found it to be such a good pastime; I purchased a copy of both books for my close friends. I would truly recommend this author to anybody.As a side note, I would like to mention that this book is indeed a sequel. I'm sure that it can be enjoyed without having read Something Borrowed, but the story would not be nearly as entertaining. In order to appreciate Darcy's transformation, you must understand the road she has traveled."
5,Couldn't put the book down!!,"I loved ""Something Blue"" Darcy was so funny, just how she was and the things she did had me laughing.. I was cheering Darcy on in the book that she would find what she was looking for. If you havent read it do so..I havent yet read ""Something Borrowed"" but Im going to start in a week...When I read a book it usually takes me a month or so to finish it, But I read ""Something Blue"" in 2 days."
2,lacking,People's personalities don't change completely. your great love of shopping doesn't just stop. Just seemed unbelieveable and dumb. Worked too hard for a happy ending.
3,Just OK,I first read Something Borrowed and really like it. This was the same story told from a different viewpoint. It was not nearly as good.
4,Decent,Good follow up to the Something Borrowed. I like that it gave the perspective of Darcy in this book when in Something Borrowed it was really about Rachel and Dex. Interested to see where the other books go.
4,A good sequel,"In this book, we get to see Darcy's side of the story. While this book will not be winning a Pulitzer anytime soon, it is a fun read and I appreciate that Darcy as seen in SOmething Borrowed is not instantly transformed into the sweet, innocent, victim. she is still as self obsessed as ever on her own journey."
2,Never closes the deal,I read Something Borrowed and found the story entertaining. I wasn't interested in reading the story of the spoiled friend; however the reviews changed my mind. I should have stuck with my original opinion. Darcy is never redeemed. She is the spoiled rich girl the entire book. She never stands on her own two feet. She goes from one guy to another. She is always being cared for by some guy. She never matures in my opinion which made the story boring and annoying.
5,SOMETHING AMAZING,"I read both books in a matter of a month. I definitely would have not put either of the books down, but I was reading them right around the holidays. Griffin's, ""Something Blue"" offers such a solid, true, and deep perspective on love and friendship. There is a pleasant meaning and undertone of life towards the later part of the book. It was a complete page turner and I literally had to pry myself away from the book to resume normal daily activities! If you liked ""Something Borrowed"" you'll love ""Something Blue""."
3,Not as good as the first,Once you side with Rachel in Something Borrowed it's hard to go the complete opposite way and like selfish Darcy no matter how much she changes. B-
3,Very Chick-Lit,"I read this only because I saw the movie Something Borrowed. Which I only watched because Ginnifer Goodwin from ABC's Once Upon a Time was in it (SnowWhite). OUAT is the only show I watch....ever besides Sprout Channel and ESPN. You can tell who controls the TV in my house. So anyway, at the end of the movie, Darcy (Kate Hudson) goes to England. Then I heard that the movie was based on a book and it had a sequel. Something Borrowed was checked out so I read this book. It is Very chick-lit and had a neat bow on top happy ending for everyone. And I mean Everyone. Darcy is not likable even when she ""changes"". It pretty much rehashes the first book from Darcy's point of view for the first couple of chapters before she actually leaves for England. Predictable ending, But easy to read."
3,Not as good as Something Borrowed,"I was a bit disappointed with Something Blue and here's why...In Something Borrowed I tolerated/liked Darcy because she was who she was. In Something Blue she completely changes and it's kind of weird or understand/believe in her new character. I feel like the book was a little rushed towards the end, making it seem as though so many things happened without us actually reading about it. I forced myself to finish the book towards the end. I definitely liked Something Borrowed better. Instead of liking Darcy more in this book, I hated her.The book is an easy read and for the most part keeps you wanting to read more."
5,If You Liked Something Borrowed this is a MUST read,Great follow-up to Something Borrowed. Such a great easy read I finished the book in 2 days. Now lets just hope they don't destoy this story line in the movie version as they did with Something Borrowed.
4,Better than Something Borrowed,"Although I was not a fan of the plot line covered in Giffin's first book, Something Blue, I did enjoy her writing style and ability to tell an intriguing story.Something Blue is the continuation of Something Borrowed, but from the perspective of Darcy Rhone who was a secondary character in the first novel. I was skeptical as to whether I would want to read about Darcy since she is portrayed as vain and materialistic. But as the story unfolds, Darcy moves to the UK, makes new friends, and slowly realizes that things she placed importance on weren't important at all.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading other novels by Giffin."
4,"great flow of words, cant stop to read!","Personally, I prefer Something Blue over Something Borrowed. I must admit, I never cared for Darcy in Something Borowed because she was just another one of those stuck up rich girls who never knew how to care for anyone else but themselves. However, when Something Blue actually took me to a tour inside Darcy's real views, I started to understand her. She was not stuck-up self-centered rich girl. I almost began to adore her for her ability to be so true to herself and others. We tend to always unconciously lie to others out of intendity to be polite (so-called white lies) but this girl does not know how to fake herself. I never knew I would love Darcy over Rachel, but here I am. The same story that we read from Rachel's point of view is a lot different from what Darcy tells us, and it sure is more exciting.Darcy may seem harsh, mean, and even immature at times; but her way of loving life and actually knowing how to enjoy it, amused me throughout the whole book!"
4,Something Blue,"Really fun book to read, had trouble putting it down most nights. Be sure you read ""Something Borrowed"" first because this book is a sequel."
2,Something blue,"Kind of a good book, not as good as Something Borrowed cause everything seems to be so easy to work out, Darcy decides to be good at night and when se wakes up magic is done."
3,A little letdown,"I was so excited to select another book from Emily Giffin after I finished Something Borrowed. Unfortunately, I'm a bit disappointed with Something Blue. It takes 6-8 chapters of recapping Something Borrowed before the story begins. I grew somewhat tired of lead character. Hopefully the next Giffin book I select will be better."
4,Loved to hate her & then loved to love her,"The beauty of this book is in the writing. Ms. Giffin takes you from having an intense dislike for the selfish & vain main character, Darcy Rhone, to absolutely loving her. Halfway through the story, you realize that you want to defend her and see her do well which, I never would have dreamt of doing during the first book ""Something Borrowed"".Great read, great writing & endearing characters!"
5,Love it,I love the shopaholic series and this has the same feel. I can't wait to read baby proof too!
1,A waste of time and money.,After I read this book all I wanted was my money back. The lead character is a jerk and the book is predictable. I usually love the author but this is one book to skip.
1,Just Terrible,"I have read Something Borrowed and it took me quite some time to get into it, considering the story was desperately trying to make cheating an okay thing. I am on Chapter 29 of Something Blue, let me rephrase that, I have suffered through 29 chapters and cannot read another page. This is completely unrealistic and frustrating. Let's have the main character, a complete self-absorbed spoiled brat, treat people like crap make a list of how to be a better person. Then miraculously do a one-eighty but really when it comes down to it is still only changing for a dude. I'm done. Don't waste your time."
2,Blah from start to finish.,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I had just finished an excellent book and was ready to start another. Boy was I in for a shock! This book was bad. It was actually a chore to keep reading, but I hate to leave a book unfinished. My husband was actually hiding the book around the apartment so that I wouldn't have to read any more of it. This book is chick-lit at it's poorest. The main character was flat and the plot was ludicrous.If you want to read some GOOD chick-lit please do yourself the favor of checking out any of Jennifer Weiners books. ""Little Earthquakes"" and ""Goodnight Nobody"" are my two favorites.Don't waste your time on this fluff."
4,A Good Read.....Just Like the 1st One.,"I really enjoyed this book. After reading ""Something Borrowed"", which I enjoyed, I was looking forward to this book. I wasn't sure I would like it after reading through the first couple chapters. I felt like I was being put through a review of what happened in book one. But, as the story went on, I realized it was necessary to understand Darcy's character better. This is a character you really want to hate. She is so shallow, mean and selfish. The author writes in a way to keep the reader interested in someone I would despise in real life. I wanted to see what was going to happen in her life. This is a good, talented author. I will continue to read future books of hers."
4,I don't know how Griffin does it!,"The narrator/protagonist of this story, Darcy Rhone, is almost completely unlikeabe. Darcy is selfish, self-absorbed to the point of being clueless about everyone but herself, and spoiled. Yet, for some reason I liked her just a little bit although I couldn't empathize with her. Not sure how Griffin does this -- is it just a natural instinct for the reader to be pulling for the protagonist? I found the writing OK, not great, but this was a pretty neat trick. Obviously, Darcy changes and grows and we are happy for her and the outcome. I should have found the first two-thirds of this book agonizing, but I didn't. It's worth a read."
5,Love Emily Giffin,I love Emily Giffin's books. She writes very well and she keeps your attention and interest through the book. I will buy another book by her again. Definitely.
2,Nah...,"I read the reviews and thought hey maybe I would like Darcy in the sequel but I didn't. Her character is over the top, unrealistic and completely not likable at all. She moved across the world to do what? Mooch off someone else for her entire pregnancy and only for a hot second admit what a conceited so and so she really is. Where is the epiphany? The revelation of conscience ... Brrr I wanted more Rachel and Dexter and what was happening in their life."
3,Not quite as good,This was not quite as good as the something borrowed. Perhaps because I just couldn't relate to the main character.
4,Great fast read,"I had seen the movie ""Something Borrowed"", so I had the characters alreay in my mind going into this book. It was very entertaining, a really easy read. Looking to purchase more from this author."
2,All I could think about was Rachel and Dex,"I loved Something Borrowed. The entire time I was reading Something Blue I kept wondering what Rachel and Dex were doing. How was their trip to Hawaii? How did Dex pop the question? What was their wedding like? What about her pregnancy? Something Blue gave tidbits here and there but I still feel unresolved. I would love to read more about them.I agree with many of the two star ratings. I don't believe Darcy could change that drastically over one conversation. Yes, motherhood can change you but in the brief timeline of the novel I just didn't get it. I was also not crazy about the predictable ending with Ethan. I loved his character but they were not at all suited for one another, at least not for a long term match. I would have loved to see her meet a mix between Dex/Ethan for a long term relationship."
5,Something Blue,"I really was not sure at first, but every time I picked it up I could not put it down. Felt confused, about Rachel, but the whole story was very well done. I figure if I need tissue, its a good read. Life is full of surprizes, and this was."
4,Great Read,"On the same day I bought ""Something Borrowed"" and ""Something Blue"". After quickly devouring Griffin's first novel, I was more then eager to start her next. And luckily, I was not disappointed.It's a great read that stays true to the character you grow to hate in her first book. But unlike what I expected, Griffin does not lead you to pity Darcy but only gives you an inside glimpse at to the thinking behind her crazy antics in both the first and beginning of the second books.The only complaint I have about the book is that at a certian point everything the novel leads up to happens much to quickly. From the break-up with her ideal man, to the birth of her babies, to making up with her former best friend Rachel, and getting her other long time friend to admit his feelings. The sexual tension that should have been the book's fore running theme was much too down played.But overall, the book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the chick lit genre."
4,Wonderful!!!,"I read Something Borrowed and was a bit hesitant to read Something Blue because I couldn't imagine reading an entire book about that annoying, self-centered Darcy! However, I caved in and I am so glad I did. This book was wonderful! I couldn't put it down. Emily Giffin takes her time with the story and provides a lot of detail and insight into each character, which makes the reader feel that much more invested in the outcome... and what an outcome! I just wish there was another installment in the Darcy and Rachel series to look forward to. I usually find most books boring so for me to take the time to write this review says a lot about this book. I highly recommend."
5,It's great,"If you enjoy ""chick lit"" you'll love this. It's the sequel to ""Something Borrowed"" which was a good read as well. Definitely recommend this for a good summer read."
4,Good follow-up to something borrowed,"I had just finished ""Something Borrowed"" by Emily Giffin and thought this would be an equally fun/easy summer read. I actually liked it better. Given the fact that this isn't meant to be high end literature but rather light reading, I thought the characters were well developed and it was an enjoyable story with a somewhat predictable but satisfying ending."
3,Shockingly better than the first,"I bought both this and Something Borrowed to read on a trip and absolutely LOATHED Something Borrowed. However, to my pleasant surprise, Something Blue was better. While the main character comes off as horribly flawed and completely unlikable upon introduction (in Something Borrowed), she does manage to somewhat redeem herself here. Still, this is not what I would describe as a fun read, so if you're looking for a fun, lighthearted escape - seriously, look elsewhere."
3,light entertainment,This book was a follow on to Something Borrowed. As such it was good to be able to follow the characters and see what happens to them. It was light entertainment for a summer day.
4,Perfect follow up,"I never thought I would cheer on a woman who was after her best friends fiance but that is just what I did while reading Something Borrowed. I really liked Rachel and was not a big fan of Darcy so I was not sure how I was going to like Something Blue because it is now Darcys turn to tell the story.When Something Blue opens we find Darcy pregnant, alone, and still the type of woman who wants the world to fall at her feet. Feeling alone and rejected, Darcy ends up flying off to England to stay with a childhood friend and attempts to start over again with a new life and love.I was never a fan of Darcy but I will tell you by the end of Something Blue, she does grow up and becomes a much better person and this was a fun book to read."
5,Awesome book!,This is the second book in the series and it was just as awesome as the first. I read this book in less than a week. It was hard to put down.
2,Dissappointment after the first book.,I was dissappointed.I liked the first book very much and I was happy when I heard the same characters were in this novel as well.However I found that story slow motion and not as moving as the other one.
2,dissapointed,"i first learned of emily giffen from reading the summer's ""must read"" lists in various magazines. they all recomended ""baby proof."" i read that book in one day and loved it. so i hurried and bought ""something blue"" i have been so dissapointed in this book. it is clearly a step back (it is her previous book) i honestly find it painful to read. the main character is not only unsympathetic and mean, but she is totally unrealistic. i would definitely skip this one."
1,It's Not Good,"I bought this at the same time I bought ""Something Borrowed"" (otherwise I would not have bought ""Something Blue"" after reading ""Something Borrowed"", since I did not enjoy the latter). I did not like ""Something Blue"" either: It is not realistic. You just now how it is going to end, but still it is not believable. All this ""turn a new leaf"" thing. Going from an obnoxious person to a forgiving loving one. I don't think so. Leaving her job when she is pregnant and spending all her savings in designer clothes? Plain stupid. There is not a leading female role in this book, a strong character, a smart woman. No, just the opposite. She has no backbone (just like the protagonist in ""Something Borrowed""). It is going straight to the bin. Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Horrible,"A dissapointment. I liked "" Something borrowed"", but this was not worth reading. I hold it for unlikely that at woman who is pregnant with twins, hooks up with her rich, and handsome doctor..... And the end - i guessed it at page 20. Not worth the time, or money!"
3,glaaaaagh,shutup i didnt read it yet!!!!!! jk u guys must really like this book huh? well anyway chow tty ...... never ;D lol bye bye -cayla <3
2,Menh!,"I enjoyed the first book quite a bit. It was a fun lighthearted read and I was looking forward to reading this book because I loved the idea of reading Darcy's side of the story. The first half of the book was fun albeit slightly annoying since the character of Darcy is somewhat annoying and pathetic. But then comes this rapid shift in the book where she ""becomes a better person"". It was such an abrupt switch/ a quick 180 that it hardly seemed believable and that's where the book went downhill for me. For 1.5 books the character Darcy was so utterly horrible and then somehow after one straight talk she gets it together and becomes a better person. I don't buy it and feel that there are many little moments in both books that the author could have set up so that the change in Darcy was believable. Something Borrowed is worth reading. Something Blue is not."
2,My final read of the Darcy/Rachel saga.,"I only survived the first half of this book thanks to others who posted reviews encouraging me to do so. While I greatly enjoyed Something Borrowed, Something Blue left me wanting more of Rachel, less of Darcy, and a more surprising plot. I'll skip the rest of this series in favor of other, more original reads sans characters who annoy me to pieces."
3,It's Okay but Darcy Annoys Me,"Some people you just want to choke and even a fictitious character can trigger that urge in me, and not in a good way. As this follow up toSomething Borrowedis all about the uber obnoxious Darcy and her incessant whining, drinking while pregnant,(which made me want to blow a gasket, even though I know a small glass of wine here and there won't hurt pregnant women) bitching, moaning and in general, self centered behavior is enough to make her the most off putting character ever. It made it hard to care what happened to her because I just didn't like her and for me, as a reader, to care what happens to a character I have to at least find that character appealing in some way and I realize that she is supposed to have undergone a giant character transformation but, by the end if you don't like her, does it matter?"
5,A PAGE TURNER!!!,This book was better than its prequel Something Borrowed.Romantic with lots of surprises!Its the kinda book that leaves you wanting more and hoping the author would write another in this series with a possible title Something Old .I would love to see more from the characters in this novel.Great PAGE TURNER that i finished in one day and looking foward to more from this writer.
4,Realistic friendships and character transformations,"I absolutely loved this second book. Great strategy to tell the second half of the story through Darcy's perspective. Darcy had transformed to where I was rooting for her to find true love. Realistic and unexpected story of friendship and love. Easy read, and compelling character to make this a quick one for me too. After finishing I almost think this second one may have been better than the first book. Great pairing nonetheless."
5,Something Blue,"I loved this book because it was a continuation of Something Borrowed, which really left you hanging. At the very end of the movie, there was a sign ""to be continued"" which confused and didn't explain. This book continues the story and makes it more believable!"
4,Nice sequel,"The author did a good job with the second part of the story. As always, she is very detailed in her story."
1,Disappointing,"After seeing the movie Something Borrowed, I thought I would pick up with the 2nd book. The first bit of this book was a recap of what happened in the first book (or movie), so it seems doable. However, I ended up hating this book and wasn't able to get past 51% (Kindle) of the book. Perhaps I missed something in the fist book, but Darcy the main character is so unbelievably annoying that I just couldn't read any further. I tried to push through in hopes of Darcy having a redeeming quality to keep it interesting. If she has one I never saw it or made it to the point where it is showed. I do realize I may have missed something from the first book, but if you're like me and saw the movie and want to see what happens it's probably not worth your time."
4,Almost Total 13,"If you like the Backyard Babies, you're gonna like this album. That being said, it did have to grow on me a little. I don't think that it just hits you over the head the way Total 13 does. The first 2 tracks are killer and there are great melodies to be found on other tunes. Some of the songs are a little more experimental and less aggressive than Total 13. Overall, a good effort and it's great to see killer rock and roll still grooving."
2,total let down,Huge disappointment after Total 13 and Safety Pins. The band merely go through the motions and there are only a couple of decent tracks until the amazing Painkiller- the best song they've ever done.
3,A Bit Off,"I really enjoy this line of soups, but this variety is pretty low on the list. The cheese flavor is the culprit, as it is slightly bitter and artificial. The broccoli texture is good and I have no other complaints, though."
3,Wooster and Jeeves DVD,"Some people like this show some don't. Any way you put it, it's fun to see Hugh Laurie being a regular constable."
4,"The 2nd season-good, but not best","First off, as a die-hard fan of P.G. Wodehouse, I am critical at best. The First season surpassed my wildest dreams, in short, it was excelent. The second season fell short, however, inasmuch as many of the characters previously introduced in the first season were reintroduced being played by entirely different actors. That was semidisapointing. Also, some of the acting is a little less Wodehouse-y then in the first. I was delighted with Gussie once again, though, and I would still recomend buying it; its well worth the money, and is as good as it is going to get on this earth."
5,jeeves is great!,Jeeves and Wooster are always funny - I found season two just as great as season one. I highly recomend this series!
4,"Very funny, but not *as* funny as the first season.","Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are the perfect comedy team for playing Jeeves and Wooster. This was proved amply by the first season, which is perhaps, one of the funniest sets of adaptations to have ever appeared on British televsion. Sadly, the 2nd season isn't quite as good as the first. Oh, it's still very funny all right, but I just don't think it's *as* funny. There's a bit too much emphasis in the second year on the secondary characters, which means a bit less emphasis on our title characters, whose interaction is the best part of the these shows. It's still well worth watching though."
5,It really is true...and it definately lives up to it's claim,"I would've considered myself to have an above-average memory before reading this book. Although I couldn't remember absolutely EVERYTHING I needed to, I got by. When you pick up this book you can take a few tests that show how poor your current memory really is. Then it makes seemingly impossible claims like being able to memorize lists of hundreds of words/numbers, license plates, anyone's name, decks of cards, and books word-for-word. But when you continue reading...and it's not a very big book at all..you start to learn its fairly simple system of relating memory to pictures, and using your own photographic memory. Within a few weeks I learned and applied the techniques and I can amaze anyone. Trust me, you will definately not be disapointed!"
4,"great cd, passes the time test","I bought this cd on a whim, probably in 97, and LOVED it for a couple years, then gave it to a friend who lost it. I've been thinking of it since and went on line to look for it, hence me writing this. I agree with one of the reviews that I read that the Volga song is exceptional... kalinka is great too..."
4,Street Fighter on crack,"Capcom continues to make great fighting games, but this time out with Power Stone they create something special. Power Stone was one of the first Dreamcast games out for the Dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying. You can go anywhere, grab anything, and then beat the hell out of your opponent. Its a great game, the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times, but thats the only flaw. Otherwise, its a great game."
4,Frantic Fighting,"This is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played (other than killer instinct), and i have to congratulate sega on it. The graphics are amazing there are plenty of characters to choose from, the levels are all varied and the two player mode has kept my friends and I busy for months."
4,Best with friends,"Upbeat scintillating graphics blended with furius beat-down action are the magic formula creating Powerstone. As a 1 player game its somewhat average. Most of the time the cpu will pound me to the ground unrelentlessly. With two players however the true beauty of this game shines through. Use lamp posts, benches bazookas, you name it to pummel the competition to submission. And if you happen to collect three powerstones you are transformed into super ass whipper. A fun but horribly unbalanced form that is nearly impossible to protect yourself from. as I mentioned before, far more entertaining with a friend than by yourself. I give it 3/5 one player play and 5/5 2 player play!"
4,much props to a real thug,mad respect to c-murder heres a guy with much paper and still living in a two bedroom apartment in the projects!ofcourse he got other pads but he actually lay his head there from time to time now thats real!im from the chi where the projects are plentiful but dam the jects in N.O are nothn nice!!i had to take a star because it was only 48 minutes but it was still a good look much respect to c-murder and the N.O them brothers bout it bout!! 4 sure
4,A Must See,"This DVD is packed with some shocking and disturbing things. Rapper C-Murder walks around New Orleans toughest housing projects(Magnolia, Calliope, Melphomine) and gives you and insight on how life is down there. You're gonna see teenagers walking around toting guns on there waist side and releshing the street life. The most disturbing part of this DVD is while filming 3 people are murdered. Slain rapper Soulja Slim is featured in this and rapper Turk from the Hot Boys has a brief appearance.If you're a fan of C-Murder or gangsta rap you gotta see this DVD.This is a must see!!!!"
5,Question?,"I was going to buy this DVD because of the reviews here and it said that it last for like 109 minutes but when I saw the back of it, in my local video store, it said 48 minutes...so, which one is it?109 minutes or 48 minutes?I'm still gonna give it 5 stars tho cuz it looks interesting!"
5,Crystal Clear,These binoculars are amazing they are completely crystal clear and the perfect size is you are going hiking or walking. I would completely recommend this product.
1,Avoid these binoculars,"I could not even focus the binoculars a short or long distance. The focus dial is also extremely sticky and hard to move. We were not looking for anything too fancy, but these failed at even being functional. They might look good on paper and for price, but these are not usable."
4,good durable binos,This is a very practical and durable pair of specs. The image is a little shaky but the image is bright enough. They are priced to be a good recreational pair and they are. Would not want to have to use them if I needed them every day or something; but then again they are hundreds less than anything like that.
4,excellent,"Excellent product , material and construction . I was expecting it to be a bit smaller and lighter but I probably dídn't pay attention when ordering."
2,Not good for price,Too heavy to hike with and unable to focus clearly. If they aren't waterproof what's the point. Plus I was charged for shipping and the ad said free shipping.
2,Not Impressed,"Maybe it's because we have not owned a pair of binoculars for 20 years or so, or that we both wear glasses, we expected more. Ordered to take on vacation to eastern coast mainly for ocean bird viewing, maybe they are the wrong strength or type? They are just O.K in our opinion"
4,Who shall live and who shall die,Chilling story well edited. Good for the next generation to have as an indoctrination to what went on and why the (Western) allies looked the other way.
3,A Bit Thin,Having read his thoroughly naratived approach in Jesus and the Victory of God I was expecting something more substanial. Given that most reading of the scriptures is first devotional and personal the corporate/hierarchical conclusion seemed lopsided.
5,NT Wright does it again,"Bishop Wright does it again in his delightful discussion of the authority of Scriptures. He provides a balance between those who would dismiss the Bible as just a book and those who have created an idol of some particular translation! Finally, he makes sense in his understanding of the true authority of Scripture found in God himself. The words bring understanding to the Word, the true authority."
5,brilliant as always,"Bishop N.T. Wright is always always exceptional at communicating theological ideas in such a way as to draw in the reader, whether they are theologians or just everyday Joe's!"
2,Bass 2 Book,"Shows nothing harmonically interesting . The Keyboard 2 book was good.This book could easily have been part of the basic book 1 . It doesn't get into Tension 9 , dominant 5 approach, arpeggios off the 3ed of a chord or walking very much. The intermediate and advanced approaches are not here . Try Building walking Bass lines by Friedland"
5,Fun,"This is fun for me and our 4 year old daughter. She is learning to color within the lines and loves this. She is very artistically inclined, so I would think that this would normally be good for older children."
2,Paper Weight,"I bought this as a gift. It's heavy and very cool looking, but that's about all I can say positive about this product. I just happened to be there when it was used for the first time. A block of cheese was removed from the fidge with excitement and placed on the cutter. Instantly the cutter was a disappointment when it wouldn't cut through the cold cheese. It literally bent the wire. She tried several times, but it just wouldn't cut. She put it to the side and grabbed a knife and a cutting board like she normally does with disappointment. Then she mentioned how the little bit of cheese it did cut was stuck in the wire groove in the granite. Overall it was a waste of money and a disappointing gift. If it fails the first time it won't get used again. She'll put it in the depths of her cabinet and the only reason it won't get thrown out is because it was a gift. If you buy a cheese cutter, buy something nicer than this."
5,Cheese slicer works great,"It's attractive, well made, appears durable, and works very, very well. Arrived quickly and was well packaged. Thanks."
2,Poor Design???,It keeps breaking the wire and the set-screw for the little handle won't lock in place... I now use just the marble table and a knife.
4,It'd get 4 stars if it didn't wobble,"Yes, mine wobbled a little but a resourceful girlfriend with a hot glue gun worked wonders. We've sliced, not cut, a lot of cheese with this tool without any issues. Like anything else, a little common sense applied & you should be ok. Slices my Gouda nicely."
5,Favorite cheese sliver,I think this is the best cheese slicer EVER!! It arrived in a timely and efficient manner. Very easy to use and clean.
4,liked it,"I liked this book, but found some parts of it depressing, Pual Zindels work is like that, I've found. This book is reminicent of the Catcher in the Rye, something about the style is similar. I wanted to buy a copy of Pardon me You're Stepping on my Eyeball because I thought it was a sequel but sadly it's not."
4,18 month-old loves it!,"I bought this particular video b/c it advertised that it was for 12 months and up. It's a low-budget production and a little goofy, but my daughter loves it! She wants to watch it everyday with her yoga mat and eye pillow. She has become more coordinated in the movements and tries to sing the songs. She even does the boat and tree poses. It is a fun way for the very young to enjoy yoga. My only complaint is that there could be a little less singing and a little more of the movement for some of the sections. This is a great yoga video for the very young, but older children may enjoy other videos more."
5,Brilliant!,"We stumbled across this DVD at the library. I had been trying to introduce yoga to my kids as a great way to exercise and relax but they didn't show much interest... I was skeptical at first as the adults are a bit creepy. However, my kids LOVED this DVD and asked for it every morning. We rechecked it out and now I am ordering it so we have our own copy. When we were on a road trip and we got out of the car to stretch my daughter went right into singing the songs from the video and ran the rest of the family through the yoga routine from the video... it really impressed me how much both my son and daughter loved it. It takes a lot to impress me and even more for me to take the time to write a review.... I felt that this DVD needed the recognition. :)"
3,Good for discussion starter,"I have been in law enforcement for 15 years... spent 2 years of that working for this man. Let me tell you, he is a pompus showboating pig. That being said, this video does give the perfect debate prompts. The discussions in class that followed this video were great.Instructor aware note: There is a brief moment of nudity in this video at the biker scene in which breasts are shown in full frontal. Probably not a big deal for college but this was high school. (OOPS!)"
4,One Tough Sheriff,"I enjoyed this Documentary on Sheriff Joe Arpaio. I believe in his way of law enforcement, maybe we should have more sheriffs/law enforcers like him. People have a choice in life and if they break the law they should be held accountable for their actions. Keep up the good work Sheriff."
3,torn,"I bought this video because I am a Professor of Criminal Justice. I felt it would be interesting to watch and study as part of a Survey of Corrections course.It turned out to be very interesting- and somewhat disturbing. My personal and professional sides seemed torn between the content and I could see the same reaction in my students. The discussion that came from watching the video was very productive and beneficial to the class.However, several students were taken aback by one of the inmates stories and as a Professor I feel I should have made them aware of what the video contained.Arguable one of the better videos for classroom discussion- if your students can handle the content."
4,Get tips from the experts...,"Although very funny, it indeed gives some good tips for those who have do presentations every once in a while. How to act if everything fails including electricity etc. And off course very enjoyable to read. Especially if you have given presentation before, you will have a lot of ""i've been in that situation""-feelings."
5,Could it get any better ?,"I have all the DVD's released and I must say this one is by far my favorite. If you havnt seen the OVA's then you'll learn about Kenshin's past. Some GREAT fights and the story just keeps getting deeper and deeper, better and better. Do yourself afavor and pick this DVD up NOW!"
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"This is a MUST for Rurouni Kenshin fans! No filler episodes here folks! The 2nd season of Kenshin starts, what Animé Works is calling The Legend of Kyoto, and it couldn't have possibly captured my love for Kenshin any more! If you love this show as much as I do then DO buy this! It has one of the best fight scenes I've seen in a long while and a touching moment that left me in tears during the ending credits. If you tend to borrow Kenshin instead of buy it, consider buying this volume ^^x"
5,Enter the Wolf,"This is one of my all time favorite DVDs of the series. An anti-hero, Saito makes his grand entrance, as the old nemesis from Kenshin's past and he's not leaving without a fight. With Saito's appearance it reveals more of Kenshin's bloody past, and is just the beginning for what lies in store for Kenshin and his friends in future epsodes.No collection is complete without this one. There's a great fight scene that is brilliantly animated between Kenshin and Saito that will make you want to watch it over and over again. Don't miss this one. If there is one great anime DVD to get, this is the one."
5,Bakumatsu Flashbacks,"Himura Kenshin starts to have dreams of the revolution. He thinks it's just his mind woundering. Nope, Saito Hajime is in town and ready to settle the score. Can Kenshin fend him off without breaking his oath not to kill? Saito Hajime is the coolest guy in the series. He is cleaver, cool, and a great swordsman. Gatotsu anyone? Anyway, this DVD is worth getting. By the way, the Shinsengumi was an actual secret police group during the Bakumatsu."
3,"SEXY, SIMPLE, CUTE","This was a simple but adult read, which had no surprises.I kept wondering why our here didn't just start up a small insurance company for the heroine. It's OK."
1,Could not keep my attention:,This book has some promise but it seemed to jump around a lot and could not hold my attention long enough to ever really get into the story. Seemed too slow and bogged down with too many details.
3,sort of frustrating,"This story was so full of miss-understandings that it was extremely frustrating. The plot to the story was over run by the main characters lack of communication. Every time they reached a milestone another miss-understanding pushed them back.The story was labeled erotic romance but it was anything but. There were only a few love scenes, but since the story was so frustrating the love scences should have had more passion.The ending was great when the clouds finally cleared, which is why I gave it 3 stars.This is my point of view as a reader. Please read the story for yourself. Unfortunately this will not go in my re-read pile.Happy Reading!"
2,Predictably fun,Very predictable but fun read.I picked it very randomly but enjoyed it. I don't think I will bother with any more of her books though.
2,Let this one get away....,"This book was a first for me - the first one I could not finish. The characters are cardboard, the plot shallow and repetitive (heroine does not want to be controlled by a man - alright I get it already!), and problems with editing. I downloaded the second book when it was offered as a freebie, but do not plan to read it if this first book is any indication of the author's skill as a writer."
5,"Hot, but it gets hotter","Beau and Kit sizzle as they both try to locate Beau's cousin and notorious jewel theif Remi. A ""can't put it down"" book."
5,very good book,"this book was great. it was such an easy read, full or romance and adventure and sometimes i just laughed out loud, i didn't want it to end."
1,Books,"Just was not for me, really reading for a woman, did not finish the book, wish I could be kind"
1,So repetitive,"Most of the story was in a narrative form, with a little dialog and action thrown in. The thoughts of the characters were repeated so many times throughout the book, I just started skimming through the pages. I found it boring, predictable and frustrating. I always finish reading a book once I start it so I did so in this case, but I found I could skip pages and not miss anything having to do with the plot line. Don't waste your time."
2,Started out fantastic and then went south pretty quick,The book had one of the best beginnings I have read in a while... very sexy poker game...but then the whole story just went stagnant. There was nothing very interesting about the plot to me and I had it all figured out pretty quickly which is never good. I read a lot of romance novels so to be fair it takes something original to really stand out to me but this book was just so vanilla after the opening scene that I really could have just not finished it. I kept thinking that the story would develop more and get more interesting and the sex would get more descriptive and hot but it just was very very vanilla and lack luster. I would pass on this book really...
3,Okay read if you don't mind skimming some sections,"Mintz documents Don Taso's conversion story in the light of his experiences growing up in poverty in Puerto Rico during the early to mid 1900s. It is a dry read because it was written by an anthropologist, so it is not written like a typical biography; it instead documents Taso's story in a question and answer format with Mintz's narration at the end of each section tying the history and biography together.Although it gets bogged down at times, the book does shed some light on the reasons why a nominal Catholic like Don Taso would convert to Pentecostalism later in his life. Frankly, the personal accounts and experiences of Taso and his wife are more interesting to read than Mintz's narrative even though Taso jumps from topic to topic. This reads less like a history book and more like an autobiography of conversion."
5,great,it was a little tricky to get the parts together but all in all my kid loved it..............she loved how his mouth moved and talked
4,Fun,"My daughter is 4 and received this for Christmas from her grandparents. It wasn't hard to put together; my husband and his father had it done quickly. It is a little hard to get it rocking at first, but my daughter got the hang of it. The only ""bad"" thing is the stirrups. They are HARD and tend to hurt her ankle/foot. She still rides, but I may end up wrapping the stirrups somehow to help her out. Fun toy overall."
5,FIRST Rocking Horse,"I got this horsey as the ""FIRST"" rocking horse for my 4 year old granddaughter. They live in a different state and my granddaughter has not sent me pictures yet, but she says that Kylee and her 6 year old brother absolutely LOVE it. I'll put in another review if I ever get more information. They haven't had any complaints about it though."
3,Didn't last long,"My son got this for Christmas when he was almost two years old. It was fun for him for a very short period of time. Not even a year later and it never gets played with. Also, the horse's voice is pretty annoying. It doesn't work anymore, however, just cuts out halfway through the phrase. I'm sure some kids would be have a ton of fun with this horse, but for us right now it's just taking up space."
4,grandson had fun,My grandson loved this horse! He wouldn't get off of it for anything. He liked the fact that you could press on the horse's ears and the horse talks to him. I would recommend this product to anyone with little kids.
1,Got a replacement and broke again.,My 3 year old daughter really wanted this so after reading the reviews I ordered it. It is very sturdy not too difficult to put together but after 3 days the noise broke on the horse. I called amazon and they quickly sent out another replacement. All has been well and 3 days later the sound is crackling and the mouth has stopped working! She LOVES the song so this is a huge disappointment and the size of this thing makes it very impossible/inconvenient to keep sending it back. What a disappointment...
4,wow,"I just want people to know I bought this for my 2 year old son. I did not buy it on amazon for over 100 dollars because i bought it at heb for 49.50. Same exact horse, maker, everything. I couldnt believe it. So look around for a better deal before you buy it here. so no i dont think it is worth over 100 dollars. Thats crazy."
5,Very surprised how well this extremely abused toy has lasted,We bought this horse last Christmas for our youngest grandson who was then 3. We put it together and didn't think it would last very long....were we WRONG?? The horse is a very much loved toy and as he has a brother 2 years older and a sister 3 years older it is in CONSTANT use daily!!! Both the boys are autistic and the abuse this horse has taken is nothing short of a miracle!!! He still talks etc. and he is jumped on and used as a spring board to fly over his head onto the couch or any other soft landing place they can find. I have even seen him standing on his head!! I wish every toy we bought held up HALF as well. It was worth many times what we paid for it.
4,Great little pony,"This is a great old fashioned toy with a new twist (sound & song when you push the ears and a mouth that moves a little). It feels well made, the fur is soft and nice and the plastic coils over the springs prevent the pinching I remember from my childhood. My 3 year old loves it and so far it seems very sturdy. If you follow the directions carefully and read other hints posted online about assembly, it's not hard to put together. I did it alone and had very little trouble with it. (Pulling the final spring into place is best done low to the floor so you can put your whole body into it.) The saddle can slide a little but comes on and off easily - my daughter prefers riding with it off and 'covers' her pony with the saddle when she's done."
3,"lots of fun, but not very durable","I bought this horse for my 2 yr old son for Christmas. It is not the end of April yet, and it is already broken. This is really disappointing because my son was scared to ride the horse until very recently, so he did not get much use out of it. He did like pushing the button on the ear to hear the horse sing from the very beginning, though. He is about 40 lbs and did ride this horse very crazily, but only for about the past month or so. For more than $100, I would expect this horse to have been more durable, especially for such a small child. To be exact, that bolt that connects the spring to the horse popped out, causing the spring to drop and him to fall sideways off the horse. Thank God he didn't hurt himself! Again, this horse is a lot of fun and looks great, but not for a big child or even a small one that rides vigorously... it lasted for less than 6 months with my 2 year old!"
2,Sounds are defective,"When the ears are squeezed horse sounds are heard. Unfortunately the ears stopped working within two weeks of receiving the gift. The child is confused as to why they do not work. The only thing that can be done is take the toy apart, find a very large box and pack it up to return to Amazon - very inconvenient.The other choice is to take an Amazon discount and be stuck with a defective and disappointing toy."
5,One of the most thrilling Petrushka readings,"Nobody ever really does a bad Petrushka these days, but this one is simply spectacular. It's very Russian, meaning almost driven and without fussy refinements. The setting is rustic, folk-inpsired, not downtown Moscow. Temirkanov gets the orchestra to remain on fire from beginning to end, and although this style of super-dramatized Stravinsky wasn't at all what the composer favored, I can't imagine living without this performance. Excellent sonics, highlighting everything, but a bit bright in the upper ranges, especially a loud volume. The daphnis and chlore Suite was not of great interest to me, but Temirkanov is direct and rather plain compared to overly fussy readings that take us to erotic fairyland. In all, this is the most galvanic Stravinsky recording in quite a while, in my experience."
4,Actual size is larger,Pleased with this product - looks very nice and has quality materials. The actual size was larger than expected. The size 'small' that was purchased seemed more like a 'medium'.
5,Solid and Easy to Use,"I haven't used many of these, but this one seems to be more solid and easy to use than others. It is quite heavy as well. The moving parts move smoothly without any noticeable drag or friction. It appears that this will take many years of moderate to heavy use without problems. I'm not saying you could drop it from the second story, but it should serve you well for quite some time."
4,Binding Made Easy,"I have never used a machine like this before and I thought that the directions were not extremely clear. For example, it said to insert the comb into the machine. I wasn't sure exactly how to insert the comb into the machine. But with a couple of attempts, I was able to get it exactly where it had to be. Despite the unclear directions, it took me less than ten minutes from opening the box to binding my first booklet. It seemed easy enough to use.The package included enough combs and covers to make 10 booklets. So, I will need to buy more combs soon. I would recommend just getting them at the beginning unless you don't plan on binding many things. I wouldn't think that I would always want to use the covers - a transparent front and a vinyl back - depending on what I was binding. I think that the machine is great for teachers and schools."
4,a good product,"This binding machine produces professional looking plastic ring bound books in minutes. The instructions are easy to follow. This version of the binder is bigger than the old one my husband used for his work, and is able to make larger books with ease. The user inserts pages to have holes punched in them, and then lines up a comb, threads it, and depresses a simple lever to marry the pages to the binding. There is some chance for human error though- if you don't line up the pages exactly right, the holes will go askew and you'll have to begin again with new pages. I am excited about using this binder to help the kids ""print"" their own books."
4,A Good Beginning.,"Vince is a very real person. His conflicts, his struggles and his qualms gives the book an unmistakeable authenticity. The plot is believable, moves well and kept my interest. It was refreshing to read a cop story whose hero is a pretty normal guy trying to do a good job. I plan to read BEHIND THE SHIELD soon--always a good indication of my enjoyment! I'll be interested to see how Mr. Mullen develops as a writer and how his characters grow"
2,I hate bad textbooks,"I am using this textbook in a Computer Animation course I am taking. During the course of most of the assignments, I found myself asking ""is equation X correct?"" It turned out that I was making a subtle mistake, but having to wonder about whether or not there is a mistake in the book is the problem. For example, if the book had made some attempt to explain the equation or where it came from, I might have asked, ""What did I do wrong, because it's obvious the equation is correct.""This book isn't all bad, though. It does contain lots of useful information. It is perhaps a decent reference book, but I didn't find it very useful for learning the concepts."
5,Best seat dog seat belt on market,"This is the best dog restraint on the market. It locks right into your seat belt jack, and clips onto your dog's harness. (any harness you own) Unlike the ones that strap into the human seat belt, this one is always locked...not just when you brake suddenly or jerk forward, causing the seat belt to lock. Therefore, your dog is always safe. It's lenth is adjustable so you can give your dog as much slack as you want. And there is a ring to clip the leash on near the seat belt insert so you can clip your regular leash right onto it and use it as an extension of the leash, making it easier and safer for your dog to get out of the car. It has 2 different seat belt inserts, for older and newer seat belts.These are hard to find so get your hands on one while you can. They are way better than any of the other more expensive ones on the market."
5,A boon for menstrual pain and arthritis sufferers,"Written very easy to read format, you don't have to be a medical person, but the advice is real practical and my father and I both benefited for very different reasons!"
4,A Good Reference for Everyone,"As a massage therapist and Healer, I was drawn to this title. As a person living with inflammatory pain, I had to buy it. Dr. Barnard gives good information about the conditions he covers and specific tips on using everyday foods to decrease pain. He explains why pain occurs and offers a dietary plan to shift it. What I really appreciated was Dr. Barnard's gentle approach. He gives you the info, tells you why it's important,how to shift pain and INVITES you to try it. I really like the absense of judgement in his book. He comes off as helpful, credible and caring. I have already lent it to clients. And, I have already experienced a reduction in pain. Thank you Dr. Barnard!"
3,Helpful,Enjoyed reading this. Found it helpful. Always looking for new strategies to minimize pain levels. At least there were a few items I could learn from this book.
5,gave as gift.,I like this so much I even have given as a gift to friends. Helps you to understand how what you eat can affect you.
5,"Easy to read, informative, valuable","This book contains all of the information you will need to learn about controlling pain through diet, including how brain chemistry influences sensitivities, sleep disorders, and chronic pain conditions. Organized according to illness, solutions are presented in an easy to follow program of eliminating potentially harmful foods. The book is chock full of delicious recipies that even the novice cook can prepare. As a sufferer of fibromyalgia, I followed the diet suggestions to the letter, and am now in full remission three months later. I now wake up pain free for the first time in over a year! The program should be followed to the letter, however, to obtain optimum results. Excellent book, well written and researched, Dr. Barnard should be commended for helping to change and better the lives of many suffering from chronic pain disorders."
1,NOT!,"Please do not waste your hard earned money on this title. I was excited to order what I thought would be a book with innovative new discoveries, or documented research. Mistake! Same ole same ole...........sorry I cannot think of anything positive about this book-oh yes, it does have a nice cover."
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome book! It has adventure, history, and Romance! If you don't have it buy it today!"
5,Monday's Child,"This is another excellant book by Linda Chaikin. Her books are not only inspirational, they are very educational. I can't wait to read the next book in this Series."
1,Unrealistic,"I have never read a book before by Linda Chaikin. I have another one, but will probably get rid of it and not waste my time. It took forever to sort out the characters, and to realize what time frame the setting took place. For the main character, Kristin, to fall so quickly ""in love"" with Jorden, a member of the Israeli secret police, was nothing short of an old Harliquin romance. I find it interesting that one of the other reviews said that Chaikin was able to answer and sort out loose ends of the story. In the epilogue only! The book is too long and story lines based on supposition instead of evidence to feel like the loose ends were tied with a secure knot."
3,Monday's Child,"I thought that Monday's Child was okay. It probably would have been easier to read if I had, had a dictionary near by me when I had read it. In most books I read I just kinda guessed what the meanings were of big words. They're weren't that many big words in past novels I had read, but in Monday's Child, it got really confusing. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, a great plot, but I think I'm going to save the book Monday's Child, and reread it when I'm closer to a grown up. Maybe I'll understand the book easier when I'm older."
3,Bushnell Binoculars,"I think this might be a good pair of binoculars, unfortunately the focusing ring was broken when I got it.I bought it from Amazon Warehouse which may have something to do with it. Sure it was cheaper, but I hope they're not sending out products they know are broken ...I sent it back and quickly got a refund, so the only thing lost is my time in repacking, and interest charged on the purchase.I think I'll try another one, but not just yet."
2,Almost OK,"I have Bushnell mod.#13-2412 12x42 (288ft@1000yds - 96m@1000m). The product works perfectly - EXCEPT... The damn eye covers are Very flimsy. The processing/attachment of the rubberish eye cover does not work - adjustably as it should. They pop off, do not turn with the plastic guides for adjustment, and their simply Cheapness for such an otherwise Great set of Binocs amazes me. It is Almost OK for the cost. But from such a reputable source(s) - I do expect a fare deal. At $30.oo - Sure. But at $80.oo - well - --"
5,Excellent binoculars!,"Now, I'm no expert but I wanted to have some binoculars that were good for the field. These have worked great for me so far! Definitely waterproof and fogproof as far as I can tell! Bushnell makes some great products."
3,eye pieces are too fragile,"These are really great 12:42's. The Eye piece plastic as opposed to the typical rubber is Not so good. The focus is excellent and the range is great. But keeping the eye pieces adjusted is a pain. I do not mean the optics. They adjust perfectly. It's those silly plastic twist things I would expect to lock into place. Perhaps I just got a bad set. It is Amazon, afterall. So, there you go. As with ALL Amazon orders (or ANY mail order item) - Check out the purchase BEFORE accepting. The picture offered with the angled eye pieces are not NOT what I got."
1,Malibu Solar Floating Light,"These were not what I expected, they produce hardly any light. I bought them for my sister, and tried them out before giving as a gift. I was glad because I would have been embarrassed. I would not order them again.Sorry for the less than nice, but honest review.Rita Marie"
1,Dissappointed,I put the batteries in and allowed the unit to charge per the instuctions.Light comes on when I cover the sensor with my hand but not at night in my pool.
3,Cake Wire?,"I loved the pictures in the book, and was looking forward to try to make some of the items. I have searched the internet trying to find cake wire no.22 that the author of the book says is the best wire to use, but I haven`t found anything called cake wire. When in comes to the thread used, I would think you would get a more realistic look using waxed linen cord, as I know some other wicker artists use. I guess I just have to try to find some other kind of wire that can be used..."
2,Did not get any answer when I wrote to them regarding this item was returned and I did not return it!,"I was very disappointed with this company because they did not take time to answer my email about the return of this book . I did not return it and was not even given the chance to reorder at same price I had purchased it before.The price had jumped $2.00 and I felt that I should have been given the price I had originally purchased it for,so I did not repurchase it."
3,A little to scary for a 2.5 year old.,"As a Parent, we know the transition to a big bed can be scary for a little one. Although I enjoy the book and in the end everything works out, it is a bit 'scary' (for lack of a better word) in 'tone' for my little one. Granted, my Son may be a bit sensitive, but I'll try to find something more upbeat and exciting to make the progression."
4,"Fairly good, not as rugged as I would like","They work well once you get them adjusted so the field of vision lines up in both eyes, otherwise there is a weird blocking issue until they are lined up. Wish they were more rugged, it took one 7 year old boy 2 minutes to wrench off one eye-piece (which went back on but just doesn't adjust as well now) (and yes, I know, 7 year old boys shouldn't have such equipment in their hands but kids are fast!)."
3,Another Antique Cozy.,"I never know what to rate Ms. Myers' books. I do enjoy them, and they are quite humourous, but the writing is not the best. She quite often slips into the ""slapstick"" in the books, and I don't really enjoy that either. If she would stick to the story, and keep introducing interesting characters like CJ (Calamity Jane) in this book, the books would be much better for it. In this book, our Abigail finds a dead body in a Louis XV armoire that she has just purchased at an estate sale. As she tries to track down the murderer in order that she'll be able to open up her antique shop again, she uncovers a very disfunctional family with any member with a solid motive for the killing. Then this is where the book breaks down. Why does Abigail try to apprehend the killer by herself? It's always this part of the book (the denouement) where Ms. Myers plotting breaks down, and the book verges on the slapstick. I'm not sure about Ms. Myers two series - Magdalena Yoder and Den of Antiquity."
4,Southern gentility at its funniest.,"""Gilt by Association"" and Tamar Myer's first Abigail Timberlake novel ""Larceny and Old Lace"" are the funniest mysteries I've read in a long time. The plot is tight, the characters are hysterical, and Abigail Timberlake is a true Southern lady"
3,Guilt By Association,"This series is an ""okay"" time filler, but I do not care to give it shelf space in my library."
5,Beautiful and Dynamic,"This recording of Mahler's 5th by a young James Levine deserves to be much more well known. From start to finish, the playing is superb, the sound is glorious, and Mr. Levine's interpretation is well-paced, controlled, and without a hint of cartoonishness that often finds it's way into Mahler symphonies (Leonard Bernstein, for example). The criticism on the length of the adagietto is downright silly. Levine gets it just right. Do yourself a big favor and get this recording."
3,Don't be fooled by the name.,"I ordered this without reading thoroughly. I love Jack DeMello's music, so I thought this was all his. Not so. He arranged it. It's not his orchestra with him conducting, etc. It's good, but not what I expected."
5,I Love It Mutch,"Great to have Him back after so many years. And it is so cool that this is not the First album. It is allready come three more, so now it is 4 albums from 2005 to now, and of course the albums from the 80's. And we must not forget Save Me and Pray For Me witch only on the best Of album. Oslo, Norway."
2,Cute in the kitchen but lacks some function due to design flaw,"I bought the scale because I wanted to be able to bake items and certain recipes give measurements in ounces, etc. The scale was also bought to add some color to my kitchen. It adds color and looks great but is not very functional. If you zoom in and look really closely at the photo(which I did not do....my bad), you'll see that the ounces do not gradually increase....they only go to 4 ounces and then one has to add and count, say to get to 164oz, you'd have to figure out where that mark is and it becomes a nuisance. I'm going to by a really nice digital scale instead."
4,Impressive compilation of terrorist incidents,"Messieurs Picquet and Shanty have produced an impressive compilation of terrorist incidents for the year 1998, outlining event criteria and event descriptions - some 398 incidents in all. What we don't know about terrorist events that occurred in 1998 could fill a book, and this is it. They have performed a useful service in describing in detail this violent international phenomenon. Turning this work into an annual series will be public scholarship of the highest order and will do much to further our understanding of terrorism."
3,Somewhere in the middle,"Reading Faulkner is very much like walking through someone else's hallucinatory dream. Confusing at best, and, if you blink, you'll lose your place entirely. Pylon lies somewhere in the middle of Faulkner's extremes. It's more comprehensible than, say, Fable (though one has to wonder, is it possible to be *less* comprehensible than Fable?), but still a more difficult read than the likes of the Snopes trilogy. At the end of the book, what we're left with are a whole lot of words about some very simple (and sensationalized) events. Still, it gets a few extra points from me, simply because its barnstorming subject has a special place in my heart."
2,Fake Pilot,Not sure why this book was written except to perhaps extend Faulkner's fantasy about being a qualified pilot. Typical of the author is the use of too many adjectives and adverbs which distort the actual subject and leaves the reader wondering.Nice jacket though.
5,A true story about people who never existed.,"Early experimental planes, romance and realities are driven out of control in a dusty town of a forgotten America. Nastalgic pilots will find the dark side of Bach."
4,Not Bad,"This being Tyrese's second album shows that he has matured since his debut album, which is for the better. The standout tracks on this album are, I Like Them Girls, Just A Baby Boy, Fling, For Always and Get Up On It. If you like his debut album you will love this one so i will recommend it to anyone"
2,Nothing Like The First,"This CD was the beginning of the end of his luke-warm musical career. His first CD was pretty good but this one seems like a generic attempt at R&B. There's nothing original in the music or the lyrics. There are, however, a couple nice sounding ballads but nothing to waste your money on."
5,Just Love It,~This is a very good CD with no scratches and very nice songs. I wanted the CD because my 1st dance song from my wedding is on it.~
2,it's the same old stuff,"I don't know about anyone else, but to me this album sounds like every other R&B album out. I am really tired of the same sound coming out ! Lyrically, it's the typical crap (not much meaning), and musically it lacks originality and creativeness. If his purpose was to be heard on MTV's TRL, I'm sure it will ,but I think the majority of the music on there sucks anyway :) hey, just an opinion. He had some of the most talented producers work on the album, but it ended up sounding like every other R&B release."
5,Smooth n God Dam Good,"this cd is well worth gettin'. if ya like ya good smooth love makin music then you should well get it. my fav on the album is either 'Im Sorry' or 'Bring You Back My Way' both of these are slow n smooth. his voice is unique n this album is gooooood. not as good as 'Joe - All That I Am' because that album is the god of R&B albums, but this album is better than 'Donell Jones - Life Goes On'. id give this album a good solid 5 star. if ya want any more good advice then get the album n see for ya self coz its well worth the money."
2,Disapointing,"I own all of Elvis' DVD's and I welcomed another to my collection. I read the reviews on amazon, and bought this DVD. What a disapointment. You are better off buying the original DVD performances. I felt the whole DVD was just showing the band, not Elvis. The shots keep going to the singers, and the musican's and Elvis third. If you were there for the live performance of this concert event in Memphis, then I am sure it was more enjoyable b/c you could keep your eyes just on the Elvis screen. They also were shown photos and clips on the side screen, which we could not see. If we were able to see photos and clips of Elvis then it would have been better.No disrespect to the band members or the singers, they did a great job, but I came to see Elvis not the band."
5,Elvis Lives,"If you ever cared for Elvis music, this is a must have. You will be amazed at what technololgy has provided us with this DVD."
1,They kept interrupting the interpretations.,"My #1 distraction is view/listen concerts. Have in my home almost 200 hundreds of them. And I get so frustrated when someone interrupts a song just to say how wonderful the recording was, and how marvelous the engineering got, or to explain the technique used in a specific moment. People, you can say those things in the special features, not in the middle of the song. Or allow the spectators to see the concert without those verbal's notes.It is true that they did a very good job remastering the sound and Elvis never sing so good, but when you express all those things interrupting the show, it's really annoying.Not recommended for a real concert fan."
5,SUPERB!,IF YOU LIKE ELVIS AND HIS MUSIC THIS IS MUST AND IT DOESN'T DISAPPOINT FOR A SECOND. THE TECHNICAL TRANSITIONING BETWEEN THEN AND NOW IS INCREDIBLE. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANY ELIS FAN OR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO HEAR GOOD MUSIC SUNG BY ONE OF THE INDUSTRY'S BEST.
3,talking heads is right,"I just bought this video and so anxious to hear and see what i have heard to much about.I am a long time Elvis fan and this to me as far as the dvd version is concerned is a tribute to the ones that put this together.It was irritating tryin to take in what is supposed to be a you are there experience, to be interrupted ever 10 seconds with them breaking in and talking over the songs with camera on them not Elvis ,and everyother sentence from Elvis camera keeps going off onto the others. Am very dissapointed with camera work,,music is the only plus great sound,but youre better just turning picture off and just listening.it had great promise too bad they screwed it up back patting themselves"
3,"Elvis lives, but not here.","I was rather disapointed with this DVD. I'm sure that to actually be at one of these reunion concerts would be great, but on the recording, there is entirely to much talking. IMHO, the producers would of been better of putting all the chatting on a suplemental disc."
5,Elvis Lives,The blending of the current TCB band with the footage from over 25 years ago is an awesome effect. Elvis is still Takin' Care of Business!
1,Iwas sent a PAL version and NOT a NTSC one!?!,From the cover it looks like a great concert BUT I couldn't play the disc as it was sent to me in the PAL format not NTSC advertised1 SoI had to return the item.Edward Kerriegolden@shaw.ca
2,Virtual Elvis?,"Now that the estate is in the hands of a corporation that is non-family based anylonger, we'll see more of these virtual things. I have never undertood the lore of Elvis. He was more of a personality than a musician. He played other people's songs. Never wrote tunes so he has that Sinatra type fame. He was more of artist that interprets other people's tunes."
5,Excellent Release,"I was at the 1997 show and the 2001 show in Memphis. They were great. This DVD captures the essence of the ""Elvis the Concert"" shows and does so with great sound and in great picture. Honestly, watching it is very close to being there in person. Elvis never sounded better. I wish they would release a companion CD. It's great seeing Elvis players together again and as brilliant as ever. This is a great release. Thank you EPE for putting it together and finally releasing it to the public. What strikes you is just how timeless Elvis and his music really is. No other singer could do a show like this and seem as fresh and modern as Elvis does. This DVD won't disappoint. Elvis lives!"
3,"Stay with the original, live performance","It's great to see all the original performers in real time, but there is no comparison to the original 'Aloha' concert"
4,GREAT JOB ELVIS,This movie lets your family and friends have a great time watching this phenominal film. Hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did.
4,energetic punk!,"This album was shipped to WBAR, barnard college radio, where I DJ. Upon first listening, i was hooked. Come with me is a great intro song, and the remaining songs don't let you down. My favorites include right back to you and profile. Not too hard but filled with high energy that will keep your head moving. Although it isn't ""hardcore"", definately not pop-punk either. This one will remain in my cd player for some time to come."
3,Eh.,"While it's not a bad album by any means, once you hear what their original sounds like, you don't really want this. It's like hearing a mid 90s Metallica album, and then hearing their 80s material: you don't want to go back to what you hear first. Deviates ""MY LIFE"" is a great skate punk album off a very indie label, whereas this is Epitaph. It shows that they wanted to be taken more seriously with their lyrical content being more political (as most punk bands are), the sound being more polished, and the instrumentation not being as fast or raw."
4,An easy way to stay on track!,"This book with it's fun approach, has given me both the technical background information AND most importantly an easy way to maintain a 30-40-30 plan for eating- I love the palm, fist, thumb approach!"
1,Sorely disappointed in a single page bibliographic!,"This does not deliver as advertised. What was downloaded turned out to be, only, a single page of bibliographic information regarding the book."
1,These are terrible. Maker's Mark should be ashamed.,"These are just ordinary, low quality maraschino cherries made with red dye. They are not good at all. They do not taste like bourbon. They do not even really have bourbon in them (the label warns they contain ""less than 0.1% alcohol). Maker's Mark should be ashamed by selling out its trademark on this product. As a result, I won't buy any of their whiskeys again. If a company is willing to make a quick buck by sticking their label on an inferior product, it clearly has no commitment to quality. Don't buy these. What a waste of money."
2,"Just meh, nothing overly special","I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries. As an added bonus for the store-bought variety, you don't have to wait very long to enjoy them, whereas these will take a couple of days to be processed and even more time before they arrive at your door."
3,Maker's Mark Cherries Not Bad,"The cherries don't taste bad at all. they taste like any other maraschino cherry I've ever had, which is the problem. These were pretty pricey to have no flavor to them other than candy cherries."
3,Nothing special,"I was hoping for someone more, but these are merely maraschino cherries with a Maker's Mark label and a drop of the mark.Not bad, but not what I was looking for."
2,"Out of touch in 2010, or Maybe Just Didn't Help Me","This book is written from the perspective of a CEO in major company who refuses to even use a computer.The good parts were talking about reality checks for yourself and your business, and part nine, which talks about etiquette and refusing rudeness. Overall I found this book not very useful, and do not recommend a buy if you are searching for good small business book. It has old war stories from a large organization hierarchy, which while entertaining, ultimately doesn't help the book's thesis.This book would serve a middle manager in a large hierarchy very well, but personally, I found little of use. An internet based company with less than ten people would not benefit from this book, and should look elsewhere in the business section."
4,Required Reading for Anyone Who Pays an Electric Bill,"As someone who works for a regulatory agency, I fear that Jack paints an accurate picture of what is happening and what could happen. You owe it to yourself to read this book and get a better undertanding of what electricity deregulation may mean to you."
5,Outdoor Wok burner,Extraodinary value for a well designed and substantial unit. It permits Wok cooking both on the patio and at travel sites. It is substantial and obviously will last for many years.
3,great for cooking but rusts,"the functionality is excellent, unfortunatly after one year you have a very unsightly rusted stand. i don't mind the wok pan holder rusting but the tri-pod legs very bad. wish htey made it from non rusting material."
5,"Big kahuna, big heat",I was a stir fry cook for over 20 yrs. This big kahuna produces the heat that you need for any style of cooking. I especially enjoy the no smell kitchen after dinner! I love this burner.
5,CANON CA910 COMPACT POWER ADAPTER,[[ASIN:B00009R6TF Canon CA910 Compact Power Adapter for Canon Camcorders]] REC. IT FAST . PERFECT CONDITION JUST WHAT I WANTED. THANK-YOU
3,"leang kar yan ,and simon yuen save this.","Its an ok movie , with some flaws.Leang kar yan is amongst the greatest martial arts actors , he performed greatly in this movie along with simon yuen[drunken master]. The plot is decent , something a bit new. The action however seems medicore [even with yan] . The most annoying factor , is indeed the kid. His dubbed voice is awful and he may annoy nearly everyone watching it. The plot can get repetitive , and the action seems not as good as other yan films. This is for the more hardcore of kung fu fans.TO fans or people wanting to watch leang kar yan films , then I strongly RECCOMEND the AWESOME ""LEGEND OF A FIGHTER""lueangs best film in my opinion , a rare masterpiece directed by non other than yuen wo ping."
1,Classic Old School Kung Fu with the great Leung Kar Yan,"First off my rating is for the Wu Tang Clan DVD not the actual movie. A truly rare and classic find. Excellent fight scenes and your usual training for revenge plot. One of my personal favorites. I'm being bias because I love most of Leung Kar Yan's work. My only complaint is not with the movie but with Ground Zero/Wu-Tang Clan. The picture quality is equivalent to an old video tape(and this is DVD?). The makers must of had an old bootleg copy and transferred it to DVD without any remastering. I'm afraid to buy anymore ""Wu-Tang Clan"" brand DVD's because the quality of this one, frankly, sucks. Unfortunately, for me, I have to settle for this because this is the only commercially available DVD of this great classic."
2,What sort of reading is this anyway? :-0,"I would have expected a clean and clear sound from the great Galway, but instead, it is dated, with a heavy and predictable vibrato. Not for me...."
2,this game is for dreamcast?,"ok, this game looks like something ported off genesis, 128 bit graphincs? no here. Unless you're still in 2d fighting games, don't buy this game! Not worth the money or the time."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"P>Control is blocky, it's easier to precision-drive a dunptruckgraphics, if you dare call it that, are weak and gave me hour-long headachesmaybe i just hate arcadie games, but this was just bad.it only got a star because there is no 1/2 star"
5,What The Dreamcast Needed,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 is what the dreamcast needs at the moment, ands thats an excellent fighting game that is familiar with everone. All of your favourite characters are in the game ranging from Vega and Chunli to Deejay and Cammy. There are various modes of play and the two player option makes this game more appealing as you will have great fun repeatedly beating your friends"
3,Did like this game,"I use to like this game alot when it came out. But, after trying out Street fighter 3: third strike. This game is for the original fans of the alpha series. The cool thing is now you get to choose a variation types of super styles. More modes making fun to play than the arcade. The weirdest but could be cool is the mode where you can already fight bison(vega) mode. If you beat him you get to see the ending for you chosen fighter. Why bother playing arcade mode then if you want to see every persons ending? I hate the two button idea of grabbing and two button recovery after being poped. Couldn't they just make it like the original alphas? Capcom seemed like they tried to add some street fighter 3 flavor to this game. I say it is fun if you challange your friends."
4,Prince and the Pauper,Prince & The PauperMy kids really enjoyed this movie. I know they hae watched on 3 or 4 occasions.
2,Where’s the Bottle?,"The ground celery seed was very aromatic and an OK price. The one thing that was not OK was Marshalls Creek did not put it in a bottle as shown in their picture. They put the spice in a non-sealable plastic bag. If you do not have an empty bottle laying around, you might want to avoid purchasing spices from Marshalls Creek."
4,MK Gold (dreamcast),"Not much to say about this game, i have followed the Mortal Kombat brand across the years and have enjoyed MOST of them. With the large roster of characters and 3D fighting space it makes the game enjoyable and fun if playing with a friend but kind of boring when playing again the CPU."
1,just play the music already,"If anyone else writes a review for this DVD other than it's filled with great tunes with nothing but interruption after interruption... they're crazy... I'm a sound man, I've run sound for major label recording artists on tour... and for a 1989 gig, and a live mix, it's not bad; but the constant interview interruptions during the intros and in the middle of EVERY tune... WHY COULDN'T ARISTA KEEP THE INTERVIEWS IN-BETWEEN THE SONGS AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE?!?!?! I almost took it off. I'm a great Kenny G fan, they should re-release this... DONE RIGHT!!! ARISTA...You have the masters... DO IT AGAIN!!!"
2,This DVD is a Documentary. Is not a good Concert!!!,"Kenny G speak all the time. Over each song. I'm fanatic of Kenny G, but this DVD is not a good purchase. Finally, this DVD is a Kenny G documentary. Is not a good concert."
1,Too Much Talking Not Enough Music,"As much as I love Kenny G, this DVD has too much interupted music. I like interviews, but I prefer a non-inyerruptrd concert"
5,The magesty of Kenny G,"This DVD has everything a Kenny G fan could want. Live music showcasing the talents of Mr G and his wonderful band, interviews with Kenny, band members and guests, and a very good audio transfer.Complaining about too many interviews pieced in between is nonsense. The interviews come in just as the song finishes, with the applause of the crowd fading into the background. Is applause REALLY crucial? I think not.This DVD is a wonderful collection of live Kenny G music, with everything from latin funk to slow blues - a must for fans. If you're not a fan, leave this one alone - it probably won't convert you. But if you like jazz music, or Kenny, then this disc is great. Laid back show - perfect for Sunday afternoon viewing or as background. Much recommended."
1,Too much playing not enough talking,"Kenny G live? Why? He's bad enough on cd. Why in the hell would you wanna hear him live. His tone is just as bad, hollow, empty, souless, despite what KG supporters think. His fans must really be tone deaf not to hear his unmistakable lack of tonality. And his pitch was everywhere but in-tune. By the way, KG does not hold the record for holding out the longest note, Rashaad Kirk does. Only difference, Kirk played it for near 2 hours with 5 saxophones at the same time and it was in tune. KG was 45 min. 30 cents sharp, with a soprano( which is not hard to blow through one of those)If you like music with quality, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT I REAPEAT DOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOT GET THIS ALBUM. If you're a tone def KG fan, scrap a rusty nail accross a chalk board and save yourself some money."
5,Loves It!,Purchased for my 2 1/2 yo great-great niece. She LOVES Shirley Temple and these movies. Received the item very quickly.
4,gift,"Christmas gift for my wife, much appreciated...goood selection, good collection..I have the flu, a headache, runny nose, aching, and this process is redundant..."
5,Great collection of the best Shirley Temple movies!,"Not only can you ""revisit"" your own childhood memories of these movies, but you can also have them to pass down to your next generation! Even my grandkids are falling in love with Shirley Temple, and I'm proud to be the one to introduce her to them. This box set has some of the best movies, and much cheaper than buying each one individually. A great buy and a great gift!"
4,Wonderful collection - keepsake to pass on,"I purchased this set from an ad on TV and paid only $50.00 plus shipping and they allowed 3 ""easy payments"". I so loved these movies every Saturday afternoon for the longest time. Now I am looking forward to maybe one day having a grandchild that will grow to love them as much as I did. Truly a bargain, and you have the choice to watch each one in either black & white or color!"
2,Should've seen this coming...,"I admit, I'm pretty biassed against this book, having not cared much for the first installment of the Hydra trilogy, ""Evil Reborn."" Dan Schmidt, the book's real author, seems to focus too much on the action part of action/advanture. I prefer the adventure part take precedence. The body count of this book--and its predecessor, come to that--begins pretty much on page one and keeps going at a relentless pace, all the way to the last. Problem is, there are so many bodies flying every which way, with bullets and brains and misiles and planes and helicopters and cars and trucks and chases and everything else--oh yeah, and there's this organization called the Coalition that's readying this conspiracy. The pattern is an all too familar one with this series: plot overshadowed by action. Pity, too--this could've been quite a good trilogy. I'll read the third installment, ""Assault Reflex,"" but I don't hold out much hope of it being any better."
1,"Not an RPG game, not much of a shooter, either.","When I bought this game for my Dreamcast, I was craving an RPG. I hoped that Armada would be able to tide me over untill a more traditional role-playing game came out. There is practically no RPG element to this game, however, and the shooter aspect gets boooooring fast. If you want a role-player, buy a role-player, if you want a shooter, buy a shooter. This game is not much of either. ...I'm going to the pawn shop."
4,Wish for old atari/nes/snes shooters?,"Old schooler's rejoice! This is the holy grail for space shooter fans! Intense 4 player action. Fun on one player, too. However, if you want new and innovative, you might want to try before you buy. The only thing keeping this game from 5 stars is lack of online play. Hopefully Armada 2 (cross your fingers) will do for shooters what Everquest did for RPGs."
2,Gets Old Fast,"The missions were far too easy to get through, and there were not enough of them. I'm not sure what you could call role playing in this game, considering the only thing you really do is fly around in space shooting weird looking alien ships. All of the screen shots advertising this game come from the intro, the actual ship you control is small and disappointing. You can upgrade your ship by buying equipment with money found from the armada ships you kill. However, to get the really good items you will have to spend many, many hours of playing the same unexciting game that is honestly not worth your time."
5,great game,i love it its been a while since a shooter pulled me in thelast time i think was Life Force for the 8bit nintendo and on top ofthat the game is roleplaying a very big winner with me:-)alot of people are asking about an ending well my sorces tell me that the ending is in Armada 2 so i can wait in the time that it takes for it to come well i do think my Ship will be pretty powerful then its level 54 right now and still going so all those waiting for an ending don't worry its comeing soon.Armada is a really good game give it a chance.you'll thank me trust me.
2,This game is so dull...,"If you take asteroids, remove the cool sounds, remove the awesome control, and add some mediocre graphics and RPG elements, you get this game. We played this for about three hours, waiting for it to get good. I really need to start renting games before I purchase them; reviewers suck at rating games like this."
2,Flat and boring...don't waste your time or money,"I can't believe that a game this shallow actually made it into production for a system such as Dreamcast.This game is more representative of the old standup arcade games from the 80's than the virtual absorbing games of today.An extravagantly long game, Armada has ZERO graphical depth and gets boring very quickly."
3,disappointing game,"If you've seen the screenshots then you know that it's a top-down shooter, much like asteroids. Of course every review touts Armada as an RPG-- but why are all the screenshots of a shoot-em-up-space-action game? Because that IS the game.It's not like Star Control! It's not like the other Star ... game where I learned the word obsequious!I think there's a rumor that this game was written with sega's online multiplayer network in mind and that's part of why it sucks. (since there is no online network)As disappointed as I was with NBA2K, go play that instead."
5,Fantastic,"This game is very good..the replay value is excellent althought the graphics aren't really that great, but it's up there. There are 6 races to choose from each with its own power and weakness and you make your character whoever you want it to be and also the story, you can follow the mission objectives or just explore and do other optional objectives out there...there are different worlds you can visit and should keep notes of some coordiantes because some of them might be clues, the space in this game is huge, it's just like you keep going and going. You can also have a wingman to help you out.This is mixed with Asteroids and Wing Commander. this is a space-shooter with RPG elements, you can upgrade, buy parts to your ships , levels, and experience.There are up to 4-players in this game (co-op) and all four, three, two can help beat the game....i heard this game has around 100 hours of gameplay and even though you beaten it, there's still more to explore."
5,Great game,This is a very well done bame and is extremely easy to learn. I recommend this item for older users though. Some concepts and ideas are a bit extensive for younger players. THis game should make a name for itself on the Dreamcast
2,Too few tapes for such a long subject,"The professor giving this lecture freely admits that if you don't study CP in a law class or for the bar, you will never get it in practice. Still, this tape series has only 3 tapes when your typical sum & substance subject has between 4 and 6. The professor crams cp rules into 3 tapes sides and article 4 payment rules in the last 3 sides. These tapes didn't become useful until I had read and made flash cards from his Gilberts law summary text. I can't believe the most difficult bar subject has so few study aids out there. This is very frustrating. I can't even say Whaley did a bad job here; it's just that these tapes alone won't do it."
2,What do you expect?,"This is about what you would expect from a 1981 low budget film. The story is lacking a bit and the comedy is lousy. The fighting is good, which makes it worth buying. I was disappointed with the audio/video quality. One channel of the audio is out of phase with the other which makes it hard to hear. By flipping the + & - wires on the back of one of the speakers fixes it. The video looks like RZA hooked up his K-mart blue light special VCR to a DVD burner and hit record. This movie is obviously aimed at Wu-tang clan fans, but it's worth checking out if you're a Kung-fu buff."
2,Nothing Fatal about this DVD except....,Errors...This DVD has the worst sound quality that you can imagine. I had to turn up the volume to 64 just to hear it. Then the picture freezes until the DVD skips chapters and shuts off. Its too bad as this is a classic that even though has a very bad storyline with bad comedy should still be in the collectors stock.I had to return 2 copies and get a credit. Avoid this Ground Zero blunder.
3,Music CD,"This recording plays less than well on my crummy, but adequate set-up, being a bothered by noise and generally lo-fi quality, maybe the result of aging technology when recorded"
5,This CD is worthy of its reputation.,"I've always liked the Tchaikovsky 1st (OK, I'm a sucker for a melody) and while I'd always heard of this famous recording, I'd never actually heard it, until tonight. For my money the performance of the Tchaikovsky is first rate and very beautiful -- well deserving of this recording's reputation. And Kondrashin's treatment of the orchestra is great as well. I don't know the Rachmaninoff quite as well, but to my ear it sounded just fine."
5,Excellent re-mastering,I ordered this to replace an old LP record that will no longer play. I was extreemly pleased to hear the quality of the cd. No one plays this concerto like Van Cliburn!
3,"Overrated, indeed","Got the CD from a library. I expected more after rave reviews and the RCA Viktor seal. The orchestra is subpar (sounds like a high school band) and van Cliburn is certainly not at his best. There are some nice moments here and there but for anyone looking for a definitive version of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto 1 (the one people listened to on the radio in the Soviet Union), I would strongly suggest Sviatoslav Richter. He recorded this concerto with various orchestras and I have the one with the Czech Philharmonic which sounds way better than this CD."
5,Van Cliburn,This CD has the quality of the original LP I purchased in 1958. It is wearing out which is why I purchased the CD. It also has the quality of the live performances I attended.
2,Not what I expected,"I gave this CD away a few years ago because I did not want to keep it - the piano and orchestra seemed not agree to each other most of the time in Tschaikovsky's first piano concerto - another battle between the soviet union and the united states. Right now I only keep three recordings from Berman/Berliner Philharminiker/Karajan, Gilels/New York Philharmonic/Mehta and Argerich/Bavarian Radio Symphony/Kondrashin, after throwing away another five including the one from Arrau/Boston Symphony/Davis. I enjoy Berman's performance the most in about 20 performances of this work I ever heard, which gives me maximum satisfaction."
2,Not even good.,"Good thing he won the 1st Tchaikovsky Competition - which literally instantly changed his life forever - and it was good for America, too. He is good (of course) but I wouldn't call him ""great"" (who would?). If you like Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No.1 more than you like Van Cliburn, buy Richter(Karajan) or Horowitz(Toscanini) or even better, Argerich(Abbado)(1996) which is the best."
3,Over-rated,"It's really weird to see the many raving reviews of this recording. I was skeptical, so I borrowed this CD from the library to hear if it was as good as people say. The orchestra was no match for Van Cliburn, which makes the whole thing unbalanced. Also, I think other soloists (Richter, Gilels) have more subtlety and shade in their playing. So anyway, do compare this recording with others and see for yourself."
5,Diopter,This is an excellent piece. The Diopter allows for use of the camera without using my glasses. That gives greater control of the shot being taken. Highly recommended.
5,Very pretty and bigger than I thought it would be,My teenage daughter loves dolphins and she was very happy to open this on Christmas morning.Great value for the price too!
2,ONLY for the Novice,"Information is accurate, but for those who have any basic knowledge, nothing new is presented here. The acting is horrible and there aren't any interviews, or footage with actual people from judging agencies, sponsors, or sweepstakes enthusiasts."
1,A Misleading Title to a Dreary Story,"This movie is a poorly acted, slow-paced, dreary, non-adventure that has little to do with Christmas. The movie is set in Wales and involves a 16-year old girl who fights to keep her deceased grandfather's horse farm from falling into the hands of a local developer who wants to turn the farm and surrounding lands into a recreational center. The developer is predictably evil and the the girl is rightuous and proud. As a subplot, the girl's uncle, who is the executor of the grandfather's estate and has come home to sell the farm, has issues of his own."
2,Poor langauge and inappropriate humor,"I was very shocked when I read this book to find that so many people deem these appropriate for children. They do have some information for the kids to learn from (the reason I chose them originally) but the way the children talk and act is terrible! I had only thumbed through one and chose it from the library from my son, then I let him read the rest of the series and suddenly had him calling names and being disrespectful and LAUGHING about it!I was really disappointed. I think things can be funny without name calling and using poor language. I am just glad I haven't ever purchased any."
1,Knights are Meant to be Respected,"I didn't like Time Warp Trio because when it began it was mostly about the knight. As you read on, it tells about the giant and the dragon. It made the knight look not very smart and like he had no power. The kids basically looked like they had all the power, even without armor. If I were the author, I would have had more action with the knight and the kids and the knight would have been the greatest fighter or he would have been up there with the greatest heroes. -LL"
1,"Small, Poorly Made, Nonreturnable","The price is right, but everything else is wrong. I bought these for an adult and they are way too small, more like for a five year old. They are cheaply made so I was able to bend the earhooks out to fit an adult, but the nose bridge is so shallow that they sit out ridiculously high on the face. And they appear to be reading glasses, which they don't tell you -- I expected blank lenses, not magnifiers. If I had seen them in advance, I would have ignored these and spent more on a different pair."
2,Santa glasses,The square santa glasses are smaller then I expected. If you have a small santa they may work ok. As for me I would perfer the larger round ones.
2,Hard to see through,They arrived with a crack in the glass of which the company reimburced me the full amount we paid for them so I would purchase from them again. They are not easy to see through so you would have to wear them low on your nose and not have to look through them ever. They do look very much like Santa's glasses and so if you need them for an hour for kids sake they would work well.
2,Why would they use magnified glass?,"I purchased these glasses to complete my Mrs. Claus outfit this year for work. However, I had to break the glass out of the lens after wearing them for an hour because they were giving me a massive migraine. Even with the glasses at the edge of my nose, the magnified glass was extrememly powerful. Why they couldn't just use plain glass is beyond me."
1,terrible,"These are terrible! They're perscription glasses!! I guess you get what you pay for, but these are a waste of money. Don't bother!"
3,ok,"i was very impressed with this gun when i opened the package. it has a good feel and the price you just cant beat. BUT, after only firing it like, 20 times, the spring inside of the clip broke while i was reloading. i was able to fix it, but it still doesnt work as well as it did. if i could do it over again i wouldnt buy this. But, if you want a cheap gun and a cool realistic feel then buy this."
2,Pale vision of former greatness...,"Well, it's a got a few good tracks, but this CD pales in comparison to the early Integrity work. There is way too much filler on here. Also, there are a few tracks with melodic backing vocals that re just not what I'm looking for when I want to hear Integrity. This one's for completists who must own the couple of solid tracks that are on here."
4,Evil Core Forever!,"Unlike the other reviewer, I'd have to say the contrasting background vocals in a few songs are what makes this CD so great and the tracks that don't have them (especially the quiet electronic songs) are the ones I skip over. If the new Misfits approached their records with this kind of attitude, they might be worth listening to. My only gripe is, there's no liner notes and I can't tell who the people who played everything are, I'd love to know if they've done anything else."
4,So close to great...,"Disappointed that the cd is not a original recording. Love the music but it is the sound tracks from the dvd series so some of the songs have comments and things going on that one can't completely follow by just listening on the cd. That said, I still recommend it. The variety of music is great. It is just fun and makes one smile! Both Mom and son end up dancing. I like that there are sounds mixed in with the music. I put it on as back ground to when my son is playing with toys or coloring or whatever and he tunes in and comments on the various activities (such as sneezing) in the songs/music. Theme song to the series is my favorite. Son and I love to dance to this song and others. He sometimes will break out into dancing without encouragement. Fun, inviting and inspiring music. Just wish that the creators of the dvd series would put their creativity to work and come up with a cd that is original rahter than simply a compilation of dvd sound tracs. That would be great."
2,Out Dated,"This story is in the 5th Grade reading book. While it isn't a bad story, most students found the story to be uninteresting. Instead of learning about the issues of learning to trust a new dog and family issues with mom gone, we had a discussion about when the story happened. There are many things in the pictures that date the story."
2,"In my opinion, VERY overrated by others...","My plan was to replace my mp3 recordings (unknown origin) of these overtures with hopefully higher fidelity CD recordings. After listening to this disk, I knew that wasn't going to happen. Audio quality is always hit and miss with classical CDs and I expect variation, but these recordings are just plain flat and lifeless. Unlike some other reviewers, I also felt the performances were generally dull and uninspired, and did not deserve to be offered to the public."
3,"Haven't used it yet, but it is thin","I have a 14"" and a 24"" wok that I use often. This wok is a nice shape, but feels a lot thinner than my others. My others are solid and don't deform at all. This one flexes easily (one finger pressure). I'm not sure how it will perform yet, but the lack of heft gives me some concern."
2,Eclectic SACD Review,"Don't bother with this unless you want the surround mix and cannot play a Quad LP version. This was no-noised pretty heavily and it's readily apparent. Mastered by Paschal Byrne, the breath in this recording just isn't there. It does state in the liner notes that it was ""denoised,"" but it should have a disclaimer on the cover itself. Why do a DSD transfer and issue a SACD (an audiophile format) and suck out the natural analog life with digital hiss removal? Total waste. Sounds like it was EQd pretty heavily. For some reason, the redbook layer (perhaps from the earlier transfer Paschal Byrne did for Bellaphon in 2002?) does not sound as heavily no-noised, and has more life. But a decent vinyl cut will shred this thing."
2,The first one was better,"Did you actually buy and listen to the CD because this isn't anywhere as good as his first CD. In fact, I think they half-assed this CD. Wreckshop has done much better in the past, especially since they no longer have ESG.Lil' Keke and Hawk set off #3 though. I would reccommend buying Keke, Z-Ro or ESG. They all have new CD's out that smash this one."
2,What happened????,"Big Moe happens to be one of my favorite artists out the south, so when I heard he signed a deal with Priority Records, i thought it was going to be a classic. I waited so so long for this album to be released, but sadly to say, i was very dissapointed. Theres a few reasons why i didnt like this album. I felt like the production was really week. I wasnt feelin 90% of the music on here. the tempo is too slow, the beats are slow, and Big Moe Singin throughout the whole album. Its almost like R&B music. Another reason i didnt like it was cause theres way too many artists featured on it. Its more like a Big Moe compilation. Its good to have featured artists on a CD, but not when theres a featured artists on every song. When people buy a Big Moe album, they wanna hear Big Moe!!!! So i suggest u buy his first album (City of Syrup) its hot!!!"
3,IT'S AN OK ALBUM,"ON THIS ALBUM, BIG MOE KINDA TRYS TO SOUND A LITTLE MORE COMMERCIAL. BUT HE STILL DOES DELIVER AN OK ALBUM. LIKE ''CITY OF SYRUP'', IT'S FILLED WITH GUEST APPEARANCES FROM THE WRECKSHOP FAMILY. THE BEST TRACK ON THIS ALBUM IS THE REMIX TO ''PURPLE STUFF'', WHICH FEATURES A SUPRISE APPEARANCE FROM PROJECT PAT. IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT IF YOU'RE INTO SOUTHWEST RAP."
4,Cool Stuff Here!,"This album is basically a remix album. If you are looking for some of Sarah's more classic stuff, then don't look here. This is all high-energy techno remixes that will get you jumping out on the dance floor. I was a little bit nervous to buy this CD, since the 2 songs are already songs that are on my other CD's, but let me tell you what, this is one cool disc that you won't be upset with. In addition to the songs on here, this is an enhanced CD that has a music video and screensaver on it. If you want the change to see her in action, then pick this one up today!"
1,A Wider Maid of Fail,"My own mistake; I got too excited when I saw a new Brightman offering and ordered without listening to any of the tracks.This CD contains none of the hauntingly beautiful vocals that need little or no musical support. Rather, it buries her under the sounds of any remake dance mix from the past decade. I could not bear to listen to the entire CD.Save yourself the cost of this dismal offering...Sign me,Disappointed in Boston"
3,Better than I thought,"At first, I restrained myself from buying this CD as soon as it was released; after all, it had two songs I already had. But I couldn't fight the urge to buy something Sarah-related and ended up springing for the CD anyway. Initially, I was slightly disappointed, since there isn't a whole lot of Sarah on the remixes (excepting the first track, and the sixth and tenth tracks). But the remixes still made for entertaining listening. If you really have to have everything Sarah, then go for it. The video and screensaver are awesome!"
3,Not quite retro enough,"Retro to me suggests a certain solidity of construction, not just a ""look."" Unfortunately, this otherwise attractive item is made of rather lightweight sheet metal which detracted from the design. I had intended it as a bit of functional sculpture on the granite counter, but it couldn't quite carry it off."
5,mac creek picks up were the dead left off,"some people might not like this album,but I belive this is one ofthe best live albums out there to date.I have seen the creek countless times,and this cd let's you experience the creek as close as it comes to being live."
5,A definate must have !,"Just got the shipment from Amazon and am listening while writing this review. It is beautiful! has all the best songs from Air Supply. Although in term of technology, it can't compare with the lastest and the greatest (Eagles DVD, etc.), hey the songs are great! It offers both Stereo and Dolby 5.1 and both are up to the job (I like the stereo better)."
2,Not as good as I had expected,I like Air Supply songs. This DVD is a big disappointment. Sound quality could have been better.
3,Air Supply look much better in 2004,"I am surprised to see how much they aged on this DVD. They look a lot better now in the recent August, 2004 performance at Casino Rama. Russell voice is even stronger and richer comparing to those early years. I am totally impressed. It was a great concert.North American fans may not have a chance to listen to 'Keeping The Love Alive' on air . It was a big hit in Asia and they deliver it live on this DVD. Now and Forever are tastefully arranged showing clippings of their past performances and still pictures. Still wish 'Without You' is included in this DVD. All in all, this DVD made you travel back in time to those late 70's early 80's years."
4,Another excellent book from Ms. Chaikin ...,"In Tuesday's Child, the reader is immediately drawn into the world of espionage during WWII. The characters are believeable and their struggles realistic. However, having read every book Ms. Chaikin has written so far, (and loving them all), I found myself wishing this story was one she would've turned into a triology. There was so much potential in the characters and the setting that I really hated to see the storyline end. The story is wonderful as it is -- I would've so enjoyed reading an expanded version on this theme. I very much appreciated the detail Ms. Chaikin gave to the historical accuracy. Another wonderful read from this author!"
4,Working Good,I am taking this in conjunction with a similar product. It not only helped my knees but with my skin problems.
5,Casanova Wong vs Dragon Lee (fist vs foot),"Dragon Lee plays a young bodyguard workin for a local merchant, after money is stolen he decides to use his muscle to stop the bandits. After taking out many bad guys he realizes that the man behind it is his one time school mate. Dragon Lee is great in this movie, and Casanova Wong is amazing again as the fast kicking villian. A must see."
1,NO SHOW,The projector showed very poor picture during the day. It was very light and needs better control. Although compact in design the projector presented inferior design and picture quality. Thank you for you time.
5,Great cookbook!!! They can't keep enough stock !!!,Great Cookbook!! They can't keep enough stock on this one - many of my friends have 'borrowed' it from me because they have not been able to find a copy for themselves. Even the Weight Watcher meeting places can't keep enough of them.
3,A mix that favors nuance over obvious hooks,"There must be hundreds of trance compilations cranked out each year, by just as many DJ's and label engineers, but I'm always up for one more that doesn't just rustle up the big tunes and string `em together. Los Angeles spinner Danny Zee let's the role-player tracks finally have their due; those records that usually bind the top tunes together are pushed to the front, resulting in a mix that favors nuance over obvious hooks.And when given the spotlight, many of these tracks deliver; Circulation's streak of winning tunes continues with the swirling rhythm of ""Lilac,"" and Oliver Lieb crafts a marvelous remix of Albion's mighty favored ""Air."" Fellow artists Taylor, Science Dept., and Steve Porter also offer up familiar tracks given a fresh feel.So while this set won't send the glitterball kids into a frenzy, trance collectors will find it a restrained surprise. Nice enough to forgive Zee for including the massively overplayed ""Roaches"" even. Grade: B"
1,Do not buy this CD if your life depended on it,"I have just finished listening to this CD which is considered a masterpiece by some. Boy do they have some explaining to do. I'd have to say ""Doperide"" is paying homage to every other ""hard"" rock band on the planet. The problem I have with these guys is that they pretty much sound like Disturbed, Full Devil Jacket, Dope, and Tool (except not as good). Anyway, their sound is pretty typical, no creativity involved. The CD almost sounds as if the producer told them to throw in some screamy ""Yeeeaaaahhh""s into their songs just so they could sound like everyone else putting out hard rock CD's. That's about all for the group Saliva, spit out their CD."
4,Dear [...],"True, they do not have a fresh sound, They remind me a lot of aband called Faith No More from the 80's R&R era.[....] But withthe type of [stuff] that has come out in the last ten or so years, (Nirvana and every other band that sounded exactly like them) this IS fresh. As a musician from that era, I can appreciate that they are trying to bring back a lost or forgotten style of rock and roll that should be remembered. Saliva, and bands like them (Buckcherry, 3 Doors Down, etc.) derserve a listen to. Who cares who they mimic?? I challenge you to find a band out there today that does not sound somewhat like another band. Either from now, or ten years ago. It's been happening since music was invented. It's called influence, DEAL WITH IT!! [....]"
1,"soul-less, forgettable","This doesn't sound horrible. It's well-produced scream rock that combines the melodicism of Foo Fighters with rap-shouted vocals like Papa Roach. And some of the numbers -- especially ""Click Click Boom"" -- would sound all right on the radio. But it's totally forgettable. Not one song has anything human underlying it. It's got as much soul as a Dorito. If you don't have enough CDs by tattoed screamers who like images of teenage girls, drugs and violence, then by all means, taste some Saliva."
5,4.5 stars - great album,"Saliva delivers a very stong album. Easy to listen straight through from 1 to 12. The beats are a great, Josey's voice is great, and the result is great. Has no real skippable songs (maybe 1) but the rest are good (a few great ones and a classic as well). Has a few songs that get you pumped up and a few slower deeper songs. A must have album for fans as well as nu-metal fans.#1 - 9 (good one to get you pumped up)#2 - 8#3 - 10 (classic - gets you pumped)#4 - 7#5 - 8.5#6 - 7.5#7 - 8#8 - 6.5 (deeper song)#9 - 7.5#10 - 8 (slowe song)#11 - 9 (gets you pumped)#12 - 9 (slower song)MEMPHIS, TNcheck all my reviews"
2,Click Click Boom?,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Not another one! I'm so sick of all these rap metal bands! They just get goofier and goofier. When I first heard ""Nookie"", I thought a song couldn't get dumber, but there's stuff out there now that almost makes it sound sophisticated. Who names a song ""Click Click Boom""? I thought only Limp Bizkit could come up with something [like that]. They even appear to try to sound like LB in this song (a bad, bad, BAD band to aspire to!). I give this two stars cuz they do have some rock-type stuff that's okay, but otherwise, UGH! Go listen to Iced Earth or Iron Maiden to hear what a REAL metal band is supposed to sound like!"
5,real music for the masses,"I still listen to this as much as did when it first came out. My first experience with Saliva was the video for "" Your disease"".I was blown away by the power and energy this band has. The world has been void of hard rock for too long. In the times of digital music this a refreshing look back to when music was fun and the bands were almost dangerous. This cd has an edge on it that only a few bands can manage in modern times. ""Musta been wrong"", ""your disease"", and ""hollywood"" are some of the better tracks.If you are a hard rock fan try this one you won't be disappointed."
2,A bit disappointed,"I bought this CD for the song ""Your Disease"". Unfortunately, the version on the CD is different (more rap and metal) than the one played on the radio. Disappointing when you buy the CD solely because you like the song on the radio. It's grown on me...but I still much prefer the radio version. The rap on the rest of the CD also grates on my nerves and I end up fast-forwarding/skipping around a lot. Oh, well. I'll stick with Incubus, Three Doors Down, Joan Osborne and the like."
3,Decent,This album is much better than their newer album. They turned into a bunch of sellouts. Going from a somewhat decent metal band into something nearly as bad as those popstar boyband wusses.
2,Don't Let 'Your Disease' and 'Click Click Boom' Fool You,"I got this CD purely on the basis of how awesome 'Your Disease' was. I am a rap rock fan, and every description of this CD was 'rap rock'. 'Doperide', 'Click Click Boom', 'Your Disease', and MAYBE 'Superstar' were the only real rap rock, the rest was all whiny! How can this be rap rock?! The only reason i gave this 2 stars were those 4 songs. Do not waste good CD money on 'Every Six Seconds'. This is a [poor] attempt to mimic everyone else.Whiny rap rock - absolutely disgusting."
4,Saliva Tastes Good!,"If you like Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit, you will like Saliva. The entire CD is strong, especially ""Musta Been Wrong,"" ""Faultline,"" and ""Doperide."" It is a great CD to listen to while driving or working out because the beats are strong and really rocking. If you like ""Nu-Metal"" give this CD a try. I know you won't be sorry."
3,Pretty Good,I just recently started listening to Saliva. And I think that they are a pretty good band. I have read the review from that 12 year old kid and I agree and disagree with him. But I highly doubt that he can write music better than this or he would be doing it.. So yea I think that this bands got some talent and the 12 year old should shut is damn mouth.
5,A very good blend of styles,"It's alt. rock, rapcore, and metal blended together and it comes out like a good pizza. If you buy this you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a CD where you can't tell the difference between the songs then DON'T buy this. If you like fresh lyrics,variety of guitar riffs,and good singing the DO BUY THIS CD."
1,EVERYTHING I HATE ABOUT COMMERCIAL MUSIC,WITH ALL THE MEDIOCRITY IN AMERICA TODAY WHY LET IT SPILL OVER INTO YR MUSIC TASTES.THIS BAND IS QUASI TALENTED JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEIR MTV ILK.FIGHT CORPORATE AMERIKKKA.IMPEACH BUSH.WIPE OUT SHOCK SHOPPERS
1,Every six seconds...,"...Another band like this pops up. Its fame maybe short lived, but their sucess is big enough for them to live off of it for the rest of their lives. Saliva, is just another one of those dime-a-dosen bands that I wish would just go away. But since MTV thinks that they hot stuff, I guess they are here to stay. Unsipired riffs, bad drumming(that ""fill"" on Your Disease is really off rhythm), and Kid Rock style vocals round out this already mediocre package. I am not going to go into too much depth because its not worth my time. If you want good hard rock music, try Monster Magnet. At least they have talent. This is best left on the shelf with those Linkin Park's and those other horrible so called ""rock"" groups."
2,Not Bad,"For todays rock, this is not that bad.. alittle to much hip-hop rock for me ... however it beats the heck outta limp bizkit ....I recommend Buckcherry Time Bomb over this.... Buckcherry has an old school straight up rock sound Aerosmith meets AC/DC.."
1,salivate on this record!!!!!,"I only have one thing to say about this record, If i could give the record negative stars-I would. Songs like ""Click Click Boom"" need to be burned. I cant tell you how many ... bands there are out there and how many ... people listen to these bands. Thank god there still exist bands that have an original sound. (Nine Inch Nails, Evenescence, Stabbing Westward.) Saliva--Leave the rap to the rappers and keep BANDS out of it--rap was never meant to be mixed with metal and if you asked me there is just too much of it out of it out there (Limp Bizkit, P.O.D.,) If you want to hear some decent rap with heavy guitar check out Faith No More, but if you want to listen to the same regergitated [stuff] buy Saliva's every six seconds, because ever six seconds Saliva is laughing all the way to the bank."
5,There is no substitute for man's desire for freedom,"It was incredible seeing Lt. Belenko's comparisons between the life in Soviet Russia and the USA. It made me laugh many times to see his disbelief at what we consider so normal in our way of life. If you know of anyone who takes our freedom's for granted, this would be an excellent book to read."
1,The price is absurd.,"I own a Canon ES8600 camcorder which is a fantastic deal for the price ($270). What blows me away is how Canon has the nerve to then charge $165.00 for an adaptor to charge your camcorder battery in your car. An item like that costs only a few dollars in parts and labor, but because it's proprietary (menaing you can'y buy generic parts and make one) to Canon's batteries, they feel they can justify the cost. This is dissapointing to say the least. There isn't much to review; the item charges your battery in your car. Done. $165.00?? Can Canon do more to say ""we don't care to be in support of our customers""?"
1,Worst movie ever,"For the record, 99.9% of the good reviews are sarcastic. Ask anyone the worst movie ever made and Kazaam will eventually pop up in conversation. Horrible movie. Period. I wish I could give it negative stars."
1,Blue Chips was better!,After seeing this movie I thought it was stupid. It had the worst acting I have ever seen and it was really dumb. Don't plan on seeing it!
5,Kazaam is Kagreat,"never underestimate shaq when he turns to the big screen. anything that he is in is automatically great, i think that it does rank right up there with Moses and hocus pocus, those were 2 other great movies that shaq should have been in. I hope this review is under the 1000 word maximum, because if it isnt then i will have to shorten it."
1,$129?!!? you should be begging me to buy this....SERIOUSLY!!!!,"rate this movie? i don't....this movie should be on Homeland Security's threats to America list. it was a dark period in American history that should be forgotten. BURN AND DESTROY all copies of this immediately along w/ any traces of his rap career and SHAQ FU. thanx. no better yet you're welcome.-Sincerely,EVERYONE IN AMERICA"
3,ok...,"if shaq didn't try and rap, this movie would get one more star! haha im serious... his singing is atrocious! anyway's the kid in this movie is precious! i feel soo bad for him that his dad is a jerk ball! it's a cute movies im sure the kids will love. i would only buy this on video not dvd. or rent it. i don't have any little kids in my house, but this would be a perfect movie for 9-14 ages. i liked it when i was that age"
5,"Greatest Movie, Greatest Actor",I AM KAZAAM. Shaq is KAZAAM. I think shaq should take home an Oscar for his role in Kazaam. It is the greatest movie in history.
3,Eh,"I saw this film shortly after it came out, so that was quite some time ago. It's all right for a kids' film - could have been better, but definitely could have been worse. The best word I can think of is 'cheesy'. It's not a bad film to watch on a rainy day or if you're bored and it happens to be on TV. Shaq is okay as the genie, and the storyline itself is somewhat cliched, but again, it could have been a lot worse. After all, who wouldn't want their own genie that grants wishes?"
5,wham bam thank you kazaam,Pure cinematic excellence! Im not sure when I first had the privlige of experiencing this gem. A towering genie that pops from a boombox is the most amazing movie concept ever! Shaq should have won an emmy and an oscar. It also portrays middle eastern characters in a positive light. Who knew that they weren't all terrorists? That kid represents a modren hero of our time who triumphs over poverty and hate. It is a pity that Shaq is no longer acting. ShaqFu 4 ever! I recommend his outstanding rap cd's.
1,good for laughs,"My friend and I rented this because we knew it would be hilarious. And it didn't let us down! The movie was downright terrible, which is why it was so entertaining. Watching Shaq act is freakin hilarious. The funniest part of the movie is when Shaq managed to rhyme ""green eggs and ham it"" whatever the heck that means. Anyways, rent it for laughs."
5,Stainless cookbook holder,"This cookbook holder is sturdy and holds even thick cookbooks, yet it folds to a relatively flat area so it doesn't take up a lot of storage space. Thanks, it was just what I'd been looking for!"
5,Great cook book stand,"My wife and I were looking for a cook book stand that would not only serve its purpose but also look good in our modern-themed kitchen/home. We searched our local Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Cost Plus...but none had the look and functionality as the Prodyne holder (too rustic in style, heavy, and did not hold larger books too well).The construction is sturdy and it can hold fairly large books. Not too heavy so it can be moved and repositioned when working around the kitchen.A very good investment, and one that does not stick out like a sore thumb in our kitchen."
5,Great Cookbook Stand,"This is a great cookbook stand, does not take up too much space on the counter and is sharp looking on your counter. Very practical, but also looks good if you are just displaying a cookbook and/or recipe. Very sturdy and holds your cookbook/recipe at a good angle to use while cooking."
2,Wish the page holders were better designed,"It's basically a nice stand; however, the page holders which are spring loaded aren't adjustable, so smaller books don't work so well with this item. Also the balls are rather large, so that you have to manipulate the book as you are reading to see what's under the balls, which seems to defeat part of the purpose of a book holder in my opinion."
4,A decent stand for jumbo sized cook books,"I picked this Cook Book Holder up for use with my jumbo sized cook books. It holds my books open nicely and looks good on the counter. A couple of quibbles: I wish the holding arms could be locked back so you could turn the pages of the cook book and then secure them down to hold down the page. As is you have to hold the arms back when switching between pages. I also find it is relatively easy to knock the stand over when you are shuffling items around on the counter. This may have more to do with the size of my cook books and my energetic cooking style than it does the stand, but it is still annoying.All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase and would recommend the holder."
4,Great Book Holder... holds your pages in place,"Great sturdy construction. Page holders work effectively for most books (paperback and hardcover). I wish it could fold a little flatter for storage and that it's footprint would be a little smaller... of course, it's footprint is smaller than a cookbook being laying flat on the counter.This is the second one I purchased. I purchased one for a former roommate. Fell in love with it... so when I moved out, I had to buy one for myself."
3,Way too big!!!!!,"I ordered this item as a gift. The material is nice and feels well constructed. The only problem is that the medium is huge! First, it's incredibly long. I'm 5'3"" and when I hold the shirt up to my shoulders, it comes down to nearly my knees. The shirt also appears very wide and the sleeves look like they will be very loose on the person I bought this for. I would recommend people order at least 2 sizes smaller than they normally wear. Also, you may not want to buy these if you aren't really tall.I haven't tried washing this shirt in really hot water yet. Maybe that will help.These would be really nice shirts if they were sized properly."
3,Huge shirt,"Bought a large one as per the sizing chart and today i got it. The quality is ok. It just looks huge, especially width. The large should be at least xxl. Anyway doesn't worth to send it back."
2,Way too large,"I ordered large size for these T-shirts as the sizing chart indicated L = 42"". However believe me that this is completely incorrect. I am 6 feet tall and medium built and still this size is large for me! Returning this back is out of the question because the shipping charges involved beat the bargain. Note that this seems to be the case with all the American Cotton T-shirts here."
2,Size chart WRONG,"Nice shirt for the Money. But the size chart is WAY off. A large is at least an Extra Large. I compared the size chart to another online stores size chart the I have purchased shirts from in the past. The chart were the same - but the size of the shirt was way large. Also, Amazon will allow you to return the shirt of it is the wrong size BUT you must pay the postage, which is 50 percent of the cost of the shirts. I did not return the three shirts I purchased not worth the trouble."
2,Size matters,"This thing is wayy oversized. The small size I ordered is the equivalent of an XL. So it appears to use the sizing charts for the big and tall. Aside from the fact its way oversized, its a nice shirt."
5,Very Good Shirt.....Worth So Much More,This is a very good shirt. Probably worth 30.00 or more.The fit was excellent. Washed great.Buying 6 more for my brother.
2,Cotton shirt,"This shirts are good material, but they are way to long to wear inside or out. They are not Polo shirts like I thought just the style."
2,Refund,I have returned the item for a refund (wrong size) but have not heard or been notified of the status
2,Grossly oversized,"These are WAY too large. I'm usually on the line between a large and an extra large. I bought several of these, using the size chart to come up with a large.They fit like tents. The cut is also unusual, with very large sleeve diameters for the shirt size.My wife tried washing one several times with hot water and very hot drying. It shrunk somewhat, but it still too large to wear other than when doing yard work. I gave the unopened ones to the clothing drive at my daughter's school. The sleeve size to shirt size would make me hesitant to try a smaller size."
4,Really big,Good quality. TOO BIG! My husband normally wears extra large. Because of the reviews we ordered Large. Still too big even after washing. I am going to keep them and take them in a bit and they should be fine.
2,Too Big,"I have no problem with the service Amazon.com offers. Unfortunately, although this shirt was labled ""large"" and my son-in-law, for whom I bought the shirt and had it sent to is a size large, the shirt was HUGE! It was very inexpensive, so maybe that is why it was so cheap, it was labled incorrectly. Rather than send it back, I think they are just going to give it away."
5,Great Shirt!,"Not sure how they can sell these for five bucks but glad they can, these are the same price as the uniform shirts at work but these are ten times better. I put my name tag on and violá, it becomes a uniform shirt."
4,I can't put it down,"This is a book I've been trying to find for sometime. This is the true story of the Division Azul. They were the Spanish volunteers that fought for Germany on the Russian Front in WWII. They felt they were trying to payback the Soviet Union for aiding the hated Republicans in Spain's Civil War. There was a culture shock between the more laid back Spaniards and the by-the-book Germans. What the men of the Division Azul may not have had in spit and polish, they made up for with fighting tenacity. The writers have done a compelling job which make it so difficult to tear myself away. If you want to know about this forgotten chapter of WWII get this book and be glad it's back in print. ARRIBA ESPANA."
5,detallado estudio...,"de una epopeya, en la que los heroicos guerreros españoles le devolvieron a Stalin la visita que este habia hecho a su pais, mediante sus comisarios, durante la guerra civil, es una edicion que actualmente se encuentra agotada, yo poseo un ejemplar comprado hace ya 16 años en la libreria San Martin, de Madrid, el cual fue el primero y muy valioso de una serie de estudios historicos que poseo acerca del desempeño de la legendaria division azul en tierras rusas,mi ejemplar no lo venderia por nada del mundo."
5,Great book!,The authors made a really good job. The examples are very good and it is very easy to understand even the hard topics. They have an online version of the book... But when you buy the book you inmediatly have access to the online version. They have very good applets that help you understand some topics and they also have a discussion group where students post their questions and the authors answer themselves. It is a really good book. I really liked it all the way.
1,Why this book?,"Why would any one write a book like this when there are such great books on networking like the ones by Bruce S. Davie or Andrew S. Tanenbaum?Why would any one want to read this book, for that matter?"
4,Can't complain,I was very eager to show this movie to my friend with English subtitle. Finally I got this DVD and we watched it. The movie is great. The print was good. I have nothing to complain.
5,Way too expensive,This is one of my favorite Lifetime movies and I would love to own it but I could not believe the price! This is way too expensive and I would be really surprised if anyone actually buys it at this price. Lowering the price would assure some sales of this movie. Much as I loved it I have to draw the line at this cost.
5,"I was definitely ""Seduced By Madness""","This DVD was something I had wanted for quite some time. LMN is not showing some of the great classics and this story of Diane Borchardt is the quintessential apex of Ann Margret's acting talents. I was even willing to pay a high price, although it is now not as high as it was advertised back awhile ago at $1800. I got it for $51 and considered myself lucky. For Margret fans, this DVD is certainly worth the $51. So LMN can go sit on a tack! I can now see one of my favorites anytime I want!"
4,Alba face wash,I thought this product was great. I am a woman in her fifties. Since I dont have a lot of oil in my skin anyway this product makes my skin feel very clean and soft. I have used many alba products and I have liked all of them.
2,Greasy!,"I wanted to really like this product, but it's much too greasy... could never wash it off clean! Note that this product does not lather, more like rubbing lotion into your face. Wiping my face on the towel afterwards, left a greasy and ""dirty"" residue from the make up left on my skin. Unfortunately, I can't give this product a very good rating."
1,Fake,This movie has nothing to do with the original Fist of Legend. Then to add salt to the wound it has nothing to do with JET LI. Instead it stars JET LE (like who is that?). Geez the nerve of people trying to make money under Jet Li's name. Don't waste time or money if you are trying to add to you Jet Li's collection.
2,UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!,"this movie went from 1974 to 1996 thats a 22 year differential. went from good old fashion chop socky of the early 70's to a mid speed action of the 1990's. robert tai back in 74' must've made his 1st film in that period of time and didnt finish it. and it was good so far. he had the great tien feng, james nam, lu feng before he became a venom and supposedly does the fight choreography along with robert tai and alexander lo rei. and it stars bolo yeung also and jet le? not jet li but jet le and this film is decent but not great so i gave it a 2."
2,ripoff movie 4 sure......,First of all i just wanna say this movie doesnt even have anything to do with Fist of Legend.It actually had a good storyline too bad it didnt follow it.U wanna know why.........? Because the darn movie breaks off to a old kung fu flick which just flat out confused me because I was following this movie so well until that point I had thought that the star was jet le not the real jet lee but the guy that was on the box the fighting in this movie was ok but the storyline had no chance once they switched up.Whoever made this movie was only trying to make a quick buck.Well I bought it so i guess they did. I knew this movie couldnt even be as half as good as the original.And I wonder does the Wu tang Clan really like some of these flicks? If they do they are corny just like there last two albums.
5,Robert Tai in the house!!,"This flick is weird,but has some great [stuff] in it.The dude who is the lead is actually Jet Li's double,and the Russian dude is actually Van Damme's double,so it's the closest we'll get to seeing the two superstars doing it. It's directed by my main man,Robert Tai,who did all the 5 Venom flicks,so you know his action is tight!The Phantasm ninja are off the hook!And the Venom Centipede is in the flick!Jet Le is actually better than Jet Li in my opinion.He's got more moves than Li. The other parts of the flick are old school type fighting with the hi point being Bolo using RED nunchuks! That's new to me!!Count on the Wu Tang to give us some strange but tasty jewels!I would suggest getting they Hidden Chambers series with the suped up extra features though.Flix like Revenge of the Patriots,Fury in Shaolin Temple, Shaolin Kingboxer,etc. They are hands down the best kung fu DVD jointz out there!!Check my other reviews. Peace!"
5,The great battle,It`s venon and warmachine vs megaman and spider man venon does venon web and destroys megaman spider man comes out he uses storm but venon blocked it so war machine came out and did war destroyer and destroes spiderman.
3,Not that good,"I thought this game was ok in the arcade, however after playing this game for a little while I found it isn't that good. Skill definatly does not pay off in this game...instead random button pressing pay off. That is why I could not really get into this game. If you like fighting games that reward skill and punish stupidity then this game is not for you. The characters are extremely unbalanced(Ryu and Capt.Commando). The computer is very unfair with someone as large as Hulk pounding you for a 11 hit air combo. I mean if someone as large as hulk can do a air combo why can't anyone else? Anyway this is only for people who really like the arcade version."
3,Marvel-ous Port,"If you loved this game in the arcades, buy it. Marvel vs. Capcom is an EXCELLENT port. But, if you beat the arcade machine into a pulp, there is not much more to satisfy you. There is NOTHING wrong with this game, except the fact that it has all been done before. The game is not an innovator, it just fills the slot for 2D figher. It all comes down to whether you are addicted to Street Fighter or not. If you want the most bang for your buck, do yourself a favor and buy Soul Calibur."
3,"Good game overall, but I expected more.","Like every game there are pros & cons. Pros of this game is 1) the many cool characters you get to play with 2) the many options you have 3) challenge. The cons of the game are 1)poor graphics compared to soul caliber ( actually most games compared to soul caliber have poor graphics) They could have done a better job of utilizing the power of the dreamcast, but didn't. 2) sound kinda sucks too. My recommendation: rent it before you decide to buy. I wish i did."
3,Is anyone reading this?,"First sentence: the arcade version is better.Second sentence: Dreamcast arcade sticks aren't for sale at stores anymore.Ending sentence: don't buy this unless you have an arcade stick.P.S.Nope, you can't use the joystick of your Dreamcast controller."
5,Great Game,"This game is good, from the very begging to the very end. I love all of the hand drawn artwork. But sometimes the sound goes very light (I.E. You can barrly hear it). But that is about the only thing I can find wrong with this game. The music is cool. The supers rock. The characters rule. This game is very fun. It's the best of the three Tag-Team Capcom games so far. Hopefully, Capcom's next Tag-Team game will be even better."
2,Overrated,"This has to be THE most overrated game on DC. It's not that good. The control (with a standard DC pad) is lame, unless you have the money to buy an arcade stick. Even then, the gameplay is very limited. The graphics are very ugly and low-res. Nigtwarriors on Saturn looks better than this! The characters are small and grainy. The sound is also screwy. Some of the music will give you a migrane. Wait for Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Street Fighter III on DC. Parents shopping for their kids be warned: this game will only be fun for a few days before it gets old (and it gets old FAST)."
5,Simply the best Marvel Game,"Very fun, the best graphics, and nice gameplay. if you are gonna get a dreamcast game, you just found a wimmer in Marvel vs Capcom."
4,I've waited for years to smack around Mega Man...,"Until the Dreamcast came along no other system could handle the 2-D graphic processing power of a lot of 2-D games without a lot of loading. Marvel VS Capcom is better on the Dreamcast than it was in the arcades, the control is easy, the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright, and the action is fast, so fast you might lose track of what your doing. Though it was overshadowed by it's superior sequel, Marvel VS Capcom is a must own Dreamcast title on its own. Also recommended is Marvel VS Capcom 2, Power Stone 1&2, Capcom VS SNK, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Dead or Alive 2, and Soul Calibur."
5,The best wedding cd ever!,"If you're getting married, this is the cd to have. I heard ""Rainbow Maker"" on the radio shortly before I got married (June 2001) and immediately ordered it. No one had heard any of the tracks before and I liked that.About 7 songs from the cd were used as background music on my wedding video and at my reception.It's a MUST HAVE!!!"
2,With this ring rating,"This CD is just okI don't know if I would recommend this right off the bat, I would suggest to listen to a sample of the cuts on the CD.I just ok"
4,Disappointed its going to end,I enjoyed this book but am disappointed that this will be the last one in the series. My favorite one was Cowboys's story. I was glad to see that all the past characters were back in this book. Maybe Ms. Brockmann can come up with some new members.
4,Masterful Artist and Brilliant Works....,"You will have to admire the works of Burt Silverman presented in this well designed compilation of his work. I have followed his work for years and he's just one of those magical craftsmen that makes me just shake my head in wonder when I see what he can do with a paint brush. He is certainly one of the best artist of our age. If you love art in the realist format, you will be well pleased with this book and with Mr. Silverman's work. This one is a ""keeper""."
2,Sight & Insight; the Art of burt Silverman,I bought this book used but it was supposed to be in very good condition. Nothing was mentioned that was obviously damaged.That wasn't the case. The cover was torn and the whole book had water dammage and was warped.The book itself is beautiful but the condition was sub par.
3,Buyer beware,"It arrived on time and does what it says. I use it so I can remove my glasses and get closer to the eyepiece for better aiming and reading of the digital display. It costs half as much as a pair of eyeglasses.However, it won't fit a rubberized eyecup, so I can't see with it in direct sunlight. It does not fit the Canon Rebel T2i rubberized eyepiece cover.The extra diopters make my eyes strain even more, resulting in relative loss of vision for several minutes after using. This makes it even harder to track moving objects (birds).I'm still using it until I replace it with the rubberized eyecup this weekend. I'll just do more eye therapy to relax my eye muscles to improve my vision. The main reason I had trouble with manual focus was not my vision, it was because I didn't know how to read the manual focus alert in the display, which not only beeps but has a STEADY green light (doh!)."
4,Every parent in the U.S. needs to read this book!,"I was anxious to receive this book since my own son has been diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease twice. Ms. Collins story about her grandson is a touching one. She does a nice job describing the impact this devestating disease can have on an entire family. She is obviously a very devoted and caring grandmother, and the story she paints of her grandson's life is moving and inspirational. She is the first of thousands of families in the United States to express the horrifying impact of this disease and I applaud her for her efforts. The information about the disease and the consequences of not receiving treatment contained in this book is something that should be readily available to every parent in the United States. Sadly enough, however, there are still millions who have never even heard of Kawasaki Disease."
4,Very good (when modified),"I purchased this phone a few weeks ago and was unsatisefied. I then called Cingular to ask for assistance. First, the memory sucked, so they offered to install an expansion. I also hated the big center button popping out so I took the center button from my previous Motorola RAZR and had it replaced. Then, (The phone is black) I bought a new silver battery door for additional looks.My phone looks very good and it was also done for under 300 dollars including phone price, so all in all, once modified, a great phone. (Oh and I replaced the battery with a razr battery for additional talk time)"
2,reasonable for travel,"I got it cheap and unlocked for travel in Europe and it did work OK. So, size, 4 bands and scratch/fall resistance were major selling points and the rest did not matter much.However, there are two really annoying things that do not allow to rate it higher: (1) there is no way to enter leading '+' for a phone number from the keyboard (so I resorted to copying and editing received numbers), (2) it does not retrieve time and date from the network."
5,Barbara Streisand,Barbara Streisand is simply irreplaceable. It is a privilege to listen to this singing sensation!
4,"I LOVED this performance, but what happened on the DUETS!?","Barbra Streisand will always be an icon to many and this performance will demonstrate that. I really enjoyed her singing The Main Event, proud of her dabblings in disco. If there was one thing that I thought would have made this performance the ULTIMATE, would have been to see Barbra singing with all of her past duet partners on stage. I really did like seeing the montage of past duet partners, but it was NOT a complete history.I think if DONNA SUMMER would have appeared at the concert to sing the #1 DIVA DUET of the 20th Century-- Enough is Enough (No More Tears), it would have definitely made the night a true spectacle!! I don't think that they have EVER sang this song on stage. I would have liked to see that.Oh Well, maybe for her next FINAL tour, she might think about it."
4,Recommended,"Not being an enormous Streisand fan, but, admiring her work in movies, I watched the concert with my little brother. It was highly energetic, and I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. There were some songs I didn't like (Cry Me a River), but that has nothing to do with Ms. Streisand. :) My favorite part was at the beginning of Act II when they did a montage-flashback. Very cool. She has an enormous amount of charisma and is a consummate actress. The way she delivers a song is amazing and I would get the tape just for that. (I did not rate it with 5 stars because I save that for things I think need hardly any adjusting, and, as a friend of mine said, the number with all of the children was ""a little schlocky."") -- Romans 10:9"
2,She is great if you love Streisand and I do but.........,"The whole concert idea was destroyed in 30 seconds when I realize this is not a wide screen dvd andit's a disappointment. It takes away the dramatic impact of feeling ""you are there. I'm not a perfectionistby any means but I assumed it was a widescreen presentation, perfect for HDTV.If you love Streisand it is a must for the song selections.............But it could have been a remarkable viewing experience, and now I have to wait for blu ray.Felt cheated."
3,Packaging doesn't match the title,"Though I'm a tremendous fan,I was greatly disappointed with what little effort went into the packaging of this title.Other Streisand features have picture disks and classy inserts.This is has nothing iside the case.It reminds me of the mass produced bottom of the line DVD's of all the old run of the mill classics,that sell for less...I guess Barbra is no longer interested in only the best..."
2,to much talk,"I love her songs very much. Unfortunately she is speaking to much, Singing not all that I love and the duets are just samples. I will wait for not alive DVD"
3,Forgettable,"The recent (March 2004) glorious release of the '94 MGM Grand New Yrs Eve concert on DVD is far superior to this one. The anticipation and magic of the '94 concert just isn't here. Barbra just walks through these songs with not even a hint of the legendary Streisand power and enthusiasm. Quite frankly, she is not even in particularily good voice. Did I really say that? The autobiographical flavor of the '94 concert was fresh and interesting; this one seems just contrived. The choice of material (especially considering Barbra Streisand's massive catalog) is dissappointing as well. 50+ albums and we get nothing but ""People"" and ""Evergreen"" and all the other standards. I'd hoped that the DVD live would be better than the CD, but it just isn't. Forgettable at best"
4,GOOD,"really great product !but its short, it would give you really good info's about the difference between show chihuahua's and normal chihuahua's.would recommend it for your own info's nothing more."
5,Great product,"I have use this product frequently. It's perfect for small projects also very convenientThe only minus is the halogen lights they are not luminous enough to depend on.Despite that, the case is constacted with solid materials and marvelously lite.It's a keeper!!"
2,Failure!,"It is flimsy and does not reflect light on the interior of the well at all. I had to add additional ""blockers"" on the outside to take suitable pictures. Would return if i did not buy it over a year ago."
2,Great concept but underpowered,"I like the basic box and the way it collapses into a convenient carrying case. With only a minor amount of creativity one can easily and inexpensively add other background fabrics from one's local fabric supply store. However, that is as far as my happiness with this product goes.The supplied tripod is nearly useless. Even with just my Rebel XTi and a 60mm macro lens the tripod sags to the side. It would also be very easy to tip it over, possibly damaging my camera.Likewise, the two lights supplied are way too weak. With an ASA 200 setting I found myself shooting at 1/4 to 1/10 second at f/2.8.By the time I replace the tripod and lights with real equipment and add some other fabrics, I have to ask myself why I bought this item in the first place. Still, I do like the box so maybe it wasn't a total loss."
2,Good concept - But more opaque than translucent,"I unpacked the kit, which was very nicely set up for portabilty. Folds flat with pockets on side for accessories. The big flaw in the product is the fact that 70% of the light is reflected off the ""screens"" when the box is set up and lights placed as directed. I don't know if the lights are too weak, or the material used for the ""box"" is too dense. Big disappointment! Please take this into consideration if you purchase. You will need a much stronger light source."
4,Does the job,"The overall kit is great for the price. It sets up quickly and easily. The lamps could be a bit brighter, and the tripods for them and a camera would be more useful if they were extendable. For the price, however, this may be quibbling. I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the kit."
3,Need more improvement,"Pro: The studio is easy to setup and easy to use.Con: The light isn't very strong, so you can't get a good lighting with it, and one of the cover on the light is plastic. After long hours of use, the heat from the light bulb burned a hole on the cover."
3,Eh. It's OK.,The lightbox is well designed with storage pockets and a folding case that's easily portable. But the lights? They run dangerously hot and give insufficient light on the subject. I had to use my own lighting setup to get good results. I wouldn't recommend this for purchase unless you use an alternate lighting system.
3,Sun Pak studio,The product had good intention but lacked in the amount of light produced by the lamps. They were too sharply focused and not enough light to fill the backround areas. Good convenience and compact but not enough available full area lighting.
3,A mixed bag.,"The soft box itself is very good. The materials are great, and it is well thought out to fold up nicely into a carrying configuration for storage or transport.The tripod that comes with it isn't super fancy or anything, but it gets the job done unless you are using a huge heavy lens. (My Nikon D90 with MB-D80 battery grip and Tamron 90 Macro lens work fine on it)The part that is lacking are the lights. They are WAY too dim for this purpose, and they look flimsy. They also get really hot, very quickly. The labels on them say to not use for more than 20 minutes (or they might start a fire?)I have the option of returning this kit, but I think I will keep it and just replace the lights. Wish I could just buy the box separately for less money though..."
3,Works well but lights are too dim,"I love how the studio sets up and has convenient pockets for storing the lights and tripod, as well as my extension cord. Problem is that the lights are too dim and there is a need for a third light to really get a ""shadowless"" picture. Also the tripod is so light weight, it tips over when I attach my SLR and tilt it up at 90 degrees (portrait). So I would say this works well if you have a small, snapshot type digital camera and if you can set it up near a window or have a third lamp to aim at it."
2,Loved it at first,Very upset!!! the standing light would keep sliding off of my table until the light bulb inside the light finally broke. Didn't think it was a big deal until you are not able to find the replacement light bulb anywhere!!! So now you only have a option to use this with only one light or buy new whole thing. Does anyone know where I can buy replacement light bulb for the standing light?
5,"Amazing Concert, Superior Quality","This is the ultimate follow-up to the band's enormously successful ""A Night at Red Rocks"" CD and video, recorded back in 1992. That was the Moodies first time to play with a symphony orchestra live. Now, eight years later, ""Hall of Fame"" revisits the band now that they've toured the world countless times with a different orchestra in every town. Naturally, the band seems much more at ease, and the concert flows smoothly. In addition to the inclusion of three great live tracks from ""Strange Times"", the standards are all crisper and better mixed than their Red Rocks counterparts. The only complaint I have is the editing that went on in the mixing booth. The Overture has been cut in half and Ray's flute solo from ""Legend of a Mind"" is reduced to about one bar, cutting off a full three minutes of the song. Still, 14 live tracks by the Moody Blues is worth a five star rating any day."
5,Outstanding!!,"this is one of our favorites of all time. I was delighted to be able to order this from Amazon, since it was a selection from PBS which would have been very costly, but I got it for a discounted price.Almost as beautiful as their voices is this total orchestra behind it. What a treat. We iisten to itevery time we go to the Cape on vacation.sincerely, H.Cummins Woodill"
5,Superb blend of orchestra & band,"I believe that my DVD of the live performance mentioned that the conductor had done the arrangements. Regardless, they are absolutely flawless. You seldom see such integrated and sophisticated collusionsof pop and orchestra that don't sound artificial - these don't - itmakes you believe that Justin was writing for just such an environment.I've just about worn out my DVD so I thought I should get the CDand put some of the songs into my playlists. I can't imagine a complete playlist without at least In Your Wildest Dreams, English Sunset, Tuesday Afternoon and a few others. It wouldn't be complete."
5,They must be the best.,"In the 60's/70's I enjoyed listening to the Moody Blues - as the years carried on I had my taste in music that varied, forgetting the Moody Blues ever existed until I began to listen to their songs again. I was so impressed, I had started buying their CD's and class them my favourite group. They are number one playing live on stage and their concert at the Albert Hall was astounding. Hoping they record more live shows. they are the best."
1,Moody ZZZZZZs................................,"Goodness, about the only thing worse than the last two Moody Blues albums might just be the last two LIVE albums. There is no passion here, save ""Nights in White Satin""...""Haunted"" is passible, but for 17.99 you'd be better off looking for the songs you want on the studio albums and buying those. I would think that a nice acoustic live album, with some different arrangments and Justin doing most of the singing, would serve us better. GET WITH IT, THRESHOLD! Give us something to care about again...."
4,The 'magic' is still there.,"What a wonderful album. (oops I dated myself) Here is the truely original classic rock band. The Beatles, the Stones and Moody Blues. This is all the music one needs. This CD, although not technically perfect, is still a wonderful trip. Of all the old-timers touring and reliving their youth, this band still sounds GREAT. If you know the Moody Blues and loved there music, this CD will not disappoint you. Keep making the 'magic' guys."
1,A wasted performance,"This album features the poorest mix that I've ever heard on a live recording. It does nothing to simulate the concert experience and makes the band sound really bad. ""Isn't Life Strange"" is missing the entire second verse. The edited version of the overture is a waste of time. I can't believe that this product was released to the public. Buy the video instead - it sounds better."
2,"Crossbreed, mix between orgy/powerman 5k lacking skills","This cd has it bright spots but isnt worth buying new - used if anything - The band make a good attempt as passing off as hardcore nu metal/industrial act - The electronic sound are tight, but they of course are made from a computer and sound perfect as for the band.... - The lead singer doesnt know which tone to go for and lyrics are weak - The drummer striaght up sucks and belongs in some h.s. band - The rest of the band is ok - dont get me wrong they have a good idea and I only hope they get better and better - there worth listening too but not over and over - 3 stars ZeRospooon"
5,WWWOOOUUUUWWW!!!!,I am from Brazil and here this band it's not very popular for here! Noone know Crossbreed in Brazil!But.. my good it's cd it's the best of the world!I am the fan number 1 of them for here in Soul America!Buy Now!the best mixture of techno and metal!
4,Cool Melding of Techno and Metal Into One,"Crossbreed is very unlike other industrial bands in that they don't just use electronic equipment, they use real European style Techno Beats with their hard rock/metal guitars and vocals. This creates a very interesting sound that could appeal to both metal-heads and techno fans. The best songs on this album are Underlined, Pure Energy and Seasons. Give them a listen you may be pleasantly suprised underground could sound this good."
3,"German Emo-Core, gotta love it","Wow. The Germans discovered some good music. This is a weird emo cd to say the least. Coming off sounding like a cross between, Thursday, In Flames, and The Deftones. Sometimes this strange mixture seems to work, sometimes it comes off as annoying. Lyrics are as intelligent as you could imagine on an emo disc. ""impress me"" is a very good song however!"
5,A Law Enforcement Must Read,"Roy Hazelwood is clearly tops in the field of Sexual Criminal Profiling. There is a wealth of knowledge that can be gleened from this mans vast experiences. The book is broken up into a number of fasinating chapters each of which hold the readers attention from start to finish. He has managed to reveal enough about the skill used to profile the Sexual Predator with out making this a ""how to"" book on how to avoid detection. Hazelwood appears to be a far more humble man than his former partner John Douglas. (Mind Hunter). As a Law enforcement officer you can't help but appreciate the pace and detail of this book. Everything form DAHMER to ZODIAC KILLERS is touched on. A talent like Roy Hazelwood comes along once in a blue moon. Don't miss out. Your Library isn't complete without This Book !"
4,Mesmerizing,I have been hoping that Mr. Hazelwood would someday write a book. I have heard so many good things about him in my reading and was looking forward to getting the info from an expert. He did not disappoint. It is a wonderfully written book that is so engrossing it was hard to put down. If this is your area of interest this is a must read.
2,What's The Point.....,The book is presented in sections that are in themselves supposed to be complete. The problem is that they jump around for no apparent reason. There is no flow. You are reading about one type of serial killer in one chapter and in the next you are learning about why and how the author's main source of information was educated. Also there were some rather brutal descriptions of killings but at the end of the chapter there is no reason for having included them in the book. In those instances there was not a wrap up to define the type of crime and criminal. It was just gore for gore's sake.I have read other books in this vein and I found this one sadly lacking.
3,Disappointing,"The book is well-written and enjoyable, as far as that goes. However, I was disappointed that it seemed to be more a biography of Roy Hazelwood than a ""procedural"" on profiling."
2,None,"If you were expecting a book like the ones John Douglas has written, look elsewhere. The book does not focus enough on the actual crimes and more on psychological things such as autoerotic asphyxiation. The book is also not in first person, which i found to be tedious and hard to get through. I was looking forward to a case by case analysis by Hazelwood himself and I was dissapointed."
3,Decent,"Roy Hazelwood is probably one, if not the, foremost authority on sexual crimes. I enjoyed reading his book, but instead of having Michaud write the book, he should have asked old friend John Douglas to borrow Mark Olshaker. Michaud's style doesn't give you the feel of the stories Hazelwood has to tell. Nonetheless, it is worth purchasing to add to one's true crime library."
3,Good but could have been better,"Roy Hazelwood knows a lot about homicide and rape, but this book is tough to sit through. Mr. Michaud as his co-author did not do a whole lot. The chapters ramble and the flow is choppy. Just when you are getting into a topic it changes to something different. And often unrelated. If not for the interesting subject matter I would rate this book with two stars. So if you like reading about the FBI and their cases you will like this book. But for everyone else maybe get it at the library instead."
3,A book worth reading not twice,I found this novel to be lacking in the content in which the people who buy it want to read. The auther spends alot of time shifting back and forth from different cases in the same chapters. Personally I wish he would stick to one case in one chapter. I enjoyed the book somewhat but it did not capture my attention as well as John Douglas's true crime books. If you buy it buy it in paperback
2,Nothing to write home about,"I was pretty unimpressed with this book. Very little time is spent on the actual crimes and the people that commit them. Most of the book is about Roy Hazelwood and how he grew up, got into the FBI, etc. The book title should have been something along the lines of ""All you ever wanted to know about Roy Hazelwood and then some""."
2,Less Than Stellar,"Reads like hearsay testimony which would have been more compelling hearing it directly from Roy Hazelwood. If you have heard Roy speak in person as I have, this is a re-hash at best. Buy it used or better yet, borrow it."
1,Can do without,"It is a shame that Stephen Michaud let Roy Hazelwood contribute to this book. If Stephen Michaud would have done it alone, I think it would have been great. Unfortunately that was not the case.For those who have not read Roy Hazelwood's work, let me explain that it has been my experience as hard core criminology and profile researcher, that his books are more about him and his ego (if you will) then the subject itself.Roy Hazelwood needs to concentrate on setting constructive examples of his very broad and interesting experience...yet we only get information from him like we are reading a resume.Other then that, The book has some good information, but if you have other books from Stephen Michaud, you will see some repetition. Not a must."
2,Boring!,"I was hoping for a synthesis of findings, rather than a rambling, never-ending series of anecdotes. Further, the latest evidence on criminal profiling is at best mixed - indicating little scientific credibility or practical usefulness."
1,Galway's tone color too bright for Khachaturian!,"I was looking for a replacement of my recording of Jean-Pierre Rampal's rendition of the Flute Concerto, and decided to give Galway's version a spin. Khachaturian's Concerto is a smoldering melodic journey through the steppes of central Asia, using the flute's sonorous lower register to an unusual degree. Unfortunately, Galway's very first entrance was 8va!!! Galway's tone color is too bright throughout the performance, making this interpretation completely off the mark.The Royal Philharmonic does an adequate job, better than the ORTF who accompanied Rampal."
3,airbrush kit,"This kit was just to test the waters, sort to speak. It was a cheap way to see if airbrushing was something I might like. As it turned out, it was indeed fun and easy to use."
1,Not enough pressure,"I bought a few of these to use in Afghanistan. Even with thinning the paint, it only has enough pressure to paint for a few minutes. After that, the paint inside the airbruh dries and clogs it up. You have to spend about 10 minutes unclogging it to get another 2-3 minutes of use. Definitely will not buy it again."
3,not enough pressure for airbrush jobs,"I was repainting a model and I could not complete the project due to the fact the can was out of air. and I had to go to home depot to purchase another air cannister. An air compressor works best. Air cans I guess, are for small projects. It's not entirly useless."
1,WARNING: Out of Date item received!,"Today is Sept.20,2008 The battery I received today after spending $14.89 is dated Jun-2004 in a dirty broken package. . . you have been warned. . . Also it is not a Kodak MAX it is a varta. That's the facts so spend your money the way you wish.PC"
5,IT'S A GREAT SINGER AND A GOOD FRIEND!!,"HOLA A TODOS!!! SOY DE MEXICO Y QUIERO COMUNICARLES QUE ESTE CD ES PERFECTO!! ME ENCANTA SU VOZ Y LAS LETRAS DE SUS CANCIONES!!

1,"She exceeds the age limit for ""britney"" type pop music!!","Wow! what a waste of money....From the look of the front of the CD I thought I was in for a real treat...but it turned out to be a real flop! She seems a little old for the whole teenager pop thing. Voice needs work. Maybe with some coaching it may improve...And switching to a different market...like adult contemporary, or something, may increase her chances of success. But selling herself as a pop girl is just not going to work. Songs are way cheesy!!!! Not work the buy. Just my 2 cents."
1,A cult Leader's fictional creation,"Before reading this book, learn more about the cult the author has created and what has happened to him in the end. Bottom line: its all about his ego."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This book doesn't succeed on any level. As an introduction to Buddhism, it has so much hocus pocus to it that only someone who already knew a little about the subject could wade through all the extraneous bs.Atlantis?? Give me a break!! For an introduction to Buddhism and/or meditation, try The Accidental Buddhist by Dinty Moore or Awakening the Buddha Within by Lama Surya Das. As fiction, it rates right up there with another example of spiritual drivel, The Celestine Prophecy. Buddhism in its purest form is one of the simplest, most logical spiritual paths one could follow, and this author bastardizes it into something almost unreckognizable. Do not waste your time."
2,there are far better books on this subject than this one,"I love books on this topic, but I hated this book in particular. I put it down about 3/4 of the way through. The author says all sorts of questionable things that made me suspicious. For example, he says that the only way to become enlightened is to study with an enlightened Buddhist master, and that there is only one such enlightened Buddhist master in the world. So it seems to me that the author is saying the the reader will probably never reach enlightenment, which for me is an overly-pessimistic viewpoint. Also, the book is too theoretical and doesn't make much effort to tie the theory into anything that even remotely relates to the real world. For a much better book on this subject, I'd recommend ""The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are"" by Alan Watts Another book that I also highly recommend is Robert Persig's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"""
1,Spiritual fraud.,"This is yet another spirituality-made-easy, bubblegumNew Age nonsense, written by a conartist. Read the articlein _Skeptic_ magazine (Lycos search) for more information."
5,An insightful and fun read.,"This book was just plain fun. I'm not sure about all thephilosophy and stuff but it was very interested none theless. I especially liked the diagrams demonstrating thedifference between linear and relational thought. Itgave me a real chuckle as a professional computerprogrammer. His descriptions jibe very well with my ownexperiences. Overall, a highly enjoyable trip. Maybe I'llget into snowboarding one of these days ... :-)"
5,Great book fun for kids,The main character surfs (snowboards) through different countries and learns things along the way. He is confronted by a Buddhists monk who teaches him the ways of enlightenment. A man who has been taught the ways of western culture is thrown into a world completely new and finds the good and the bad of both lifestyles. Throughout the book the main character learns the value of life and becomes an expert in the ways on Buddhism.This book gives you a glimpse into the belief of Buddhism. Using a unique edge the book is able to attract the younger readers. Using the sport of snowboarding people find the book interesting and learn a lot about the usually mundane ways of Buddhism. The book is insightful with lots of values. The book combines the culture of the snowboarding world and that of the surrounding Himalayan countries.
5,Simple as Buddhism is..,"Readers, those who appreciate and strive to understand and those who are willing to learn the light and wisdom of Buddhism will enjoy Dr. Lenz's novel. Forget that you are reading a novel because this is not aimed to be ""The Great American Novel"" rather a story of an encounter... something like East meets West in harmony/commonality. This book is as simple as the Buddhist teachings and has a soft edge to the purity of Buddhist principles. What you may find is encouragement to believe that everything around you has a positivity... if you are mindful and that harmony is found for those who are in touch with their spirit and energy, and the impact that the two have on their surroundings. (There is also additional harmony from those who know how it feels to carve up a mountainside or surf the Big Blue). Keep your head up mentality and the wholeness that meditaion brings is the theme, keep up if you can! Peace"
3,Know your audiencE,"Lenz wrote this for the novice, splashing in various ideas from adjacent domains. I'd give it to young people into snowboarding, edge seeking and wanderlusting who are starting to formulate their own ideas about life. When I was growing up it was Castaneda. Now it's Master Fwap. Woah!"
1,Surfing the Himalayas of Rama's Ego,"I've just finished reading Lenz's ""Surfing the Himalayas of My Ego"" book. The first part of the book read like a high school girl's diary, then the writing style tightened up and actually wasn't bad. So too, a bit of content was interjected that was reasonably decent. Then the sh** storm started, a storm that was so incredibly logically inconsistent that it was offensive. But still fascinating. And we're not talking about inconsistent with respect to external frameworks, we're talking inconsistent within the framework in which the tale is set. Buying into that load would require extreme gullibility and the complete suspension of all of one's critical facilities. One begins to see where mind-altering drugs were a necessary part of the Lenzian ""gatherings in the desert"". Seriously, the book has no depth and it not only ignores standard tenets of Buddhism, it occassionally contravenes them as well."
1,World-Class FRAUD!!,"This Lenz guy, a supposed ""World-Class Snowboarder"" is/was a complete fraud. (...) Anyway, I've been riding for years now and if you've stepped on a board and you think this book is gonna offer you something - think again. It's a shame that this guy climbed on the bandwagon when snowboarding got popular and decided to include it in his ""spiritual journey"". (...)STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK - IT IS PURE EVIL!"
1,Frederick Lenz's miserable attempt to create a primer for po,"Frederick Lenz's miserable attempt to create a primer for pop pseudo-Buddhist/snowboarder wannabes is both disrespectful and down right offensive to true adherents of these disciplines. The prose of this failure more closely mimics that of the ""Curious George"" series than it does the writing of a man truly enlightened by spiritual adventure. A reader seeking to find the true nature of the himilayan spiritual life would could come much closer with a read of Peter Matthiessen's ""Snow Leopard"" or just about any book other than the subject of this review."""
5,The book's even better than the tape.,"I picked up the Surfing the Himalayas audio tape before heading out on a trip from Boston to D.C. I didn't know anything about it, but it looked interesting.I didn't expect much, but the next thing I knew, a couple hours had passed, the tape was over, and I hardly even noticed the traffic and the non-stop construction crews on the 95.This guy is coming from a high place. It sent my mind flying.A couple months later I bought the book, and it was a more in-depth perspective on enlightened consciousness. It's cool how he modernized these ancient truths."
5,"Very Interesting, Very Surprising","What I enjoyed about this book is that it covered not only the people like me (gay, male, plans to have children), but it also gave me an insight into some others who have very different lives but the same issues of ""alternative-ness."" It actually contained a few surprises and gave me some ideas about how a family could be built from things I'd never considered before."
4,good overall product - some cheap accessories,"The big 30-qt pot is a little flimsy and bends and nicks easily so you have to be careful not to bang it up. But the burner works fine and the written instructions are easy enough to follow.The thermometer broke after the first use, however, and the instructional video was a total joke. It looked like I made it in my yard with a camcorder in one take. Really amateur and doesn't tell you much you don't already know. Be careful of not letting the oil get too hot: remember that the oil is way hotter at the bottom of the pot."
3,So-so...,"Some of the games required so much explanation to guests about how to play, that I got tired reading the book! I found about 4 ideas that I might use. Guests don't want to stand around listening to rules...and having to remember them. I think Mr. Wiswell was trying to have a unique book of games and he does...I'll give him that!"
1,Terrible dispenser,Who writes a review about a dispenser? I do. Because our experience with them in a medical office has been just THAT bad. We have purchased about 6 of these dispensers and we never know if it will actually work when we receive it. I am definitely going to be looking for a different type of dispenser because these are so badly made.
1,Inadequate check valve,The operation of the dispenser depends on a check valve consisting of a small plastic bead that drops back to prevent alcohol from running back into the bottle. The bead is not heavy enough to work reliably.
3,Does not pump all the time,"Unless the container is full,MIT will not pump fluid up to the dispenser. It takes about 20-30 pumps to get fluid to the top. No functional at all. I would not recommend it."
3,Not essential,"I've started building a pretty good library of canning books. Some have amazing information, some have essential safety tips, some have both. I bat my eyelashes at those ones and take them off the shelf more often than the others. This book doesn't really have either. The information is hard to find due to awkward indexing and the recipes are a bit lackluster. I've used the book as reference for canning times and scanned the recipes but I don't know if I've ever made a straight recipe from this book. It's not the worst preserving book out there but it's certainly not the best."
5,One of my stand-by's,"Great recipes and ideas. I've been canning off and on for almost 10 years, and this is one of my favorite reference guides so far. This is one of those books that, if I ever lost it, I'd be inconsolable (it's in storage right now, right in the middle of harvest season, and it's driving me nuts!)"
5,love it,"This comprehensive book has helped us at my restaurant begin preserving more of what we make. Our own pickles and jams and other condiments, and this summer we will preserve tomatoes and other veg. I can't wait! It is a great and thorough book, though I do recommend taking a class or having an experienced friend to help you out the first time, no matter what book you have."
1,Not a good reference book,"I have been preserving and canning for more years than I want to count and thought I'd get one more preserving book to modernize my collection. This book is terrible. The index is the biggest problem. If you search canning pickles recipes, there is just a list of pages rather than naming the type of pickle you may be looking for. There is no easy way to look up a sweet pickle recipe, for instance. You have to search through the pages to find what you want. Want a recipe for pickled beets? You won't find it in this book. I wish I hadn't bought this book; it's a waste of money."
1,Brilliantissimo my ass!!,"I'm sick of all those ""Music Lover's ***** star"" rating for this piece of crap.If you bought this, try to get the same works by REAL pianists, you'll note the difference, or please do me a favor and don't say you like classical music. You just loved Shine and wanted to hear David playing. Look at the reviews os his recording of Rachmaninoff's third Concerto and you'll see.I'm sorry for Mr. Helfgott, because he doesn't know what he's doing or what's going on around him, he's just an innocent soul. Shame on Gillian Helfgott !Sorry Mr. Hicks but I think you picked the wrong idea for a movie, but I still think that Geoffrey Rush made a wonderful job.If you want to know more about David, buy her sister's book. It reveals some interesting stuff about his life and specially his satanized father."
1,WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY,"With Kenny G being the best selling saxophonist ever, you can't blame those folks who are falling all over for poor Mr. Helfgott's ""pianism"". As for the major music labels- who told you they're there to promote good music or good taste. They are corporations and set out to make money."
2,Why does this continue?,"While sympathetic to Mr. Helfgott's plight, there is no reason why CD's should be continued to be released when there are so many other deserving artists out there who need the exposure. Helfgott's playing is lacking in both brilliance and colour. To put him on such a level as that of Horowitz[as in a previous review], is quite frankly, a travestly."
4,it's a pan,"it's a big metal galvanized pan. got it to put the kerosene heater on and it does the job: big, metal, 1"" lip. not much else to say here."
1,Very Poor Quality - Waste of money.,"This spreader looks good and I thought it would work great for my purposes, but boy was I wrong. The first time I used it the shaft sprocket broke off! Upon inspection I noticed that the gears, shafts and sprockets are way undersized and not at all durable. Don't buy this one. If you do, you will regret it. And, one more note, the customer service is horrible."
1,Agri-Junk,"The gear/sprocket mechanism on this cheaply built machine is far too light and the tolerances are so loose that it constantly jams, especially when fully loaded, if anything the hopper is actually too big for the undercarriage. Mine never worked well and finally locked up for good after less than 50 bags of fertilizer had been run through it. I would never buy one of these again, I wouldnt even take one if it was given to me."
2,Conventional realism,"First, I must say that I read the book in French,so that my comment concerns neither the translationnor any possible notes.This presentation of Zen reduces it to yet anotherrealism. It assumes the existence of a universalreality which has to be uncovered.In this, it doesn't depart from e.g. Platonism.The book uses an existentialist vocabulary, whichprobably shows its age, but without the authorreally mastering the concepts.A clear example is 'néant' (excuse my French),which is more or less treated as a negativecounterpart to (positive) Being.Well, not so in the Hegelian tradition followedby Heidegger and Sartre.In short, a work of involuntary demystification."
5,A profound classic!,"I have read this book several times over the course of five or so years; a rare occurence for me. The fact that Aldous Huxley writes the foreword should speak volumes in itself. In Huxley's own words this profound classic seeks to break through all that ""obstructs the flow of life and grace and inspiration."" A challenging read, but I doubt that you would regret having this book in your life. Consider it yeast!"
2,Brooke Tucker's Golden Christmas,"Checked this book out of the library before spending $200.00 plus for a used book that originally cost $39.95. Glad I did! If you are looking for miniature Christmas ideas and instructions for decorations, forget this book! Instructions provided are for room-boxes. No decorations included! Very dissapointing!"
2,Antifog Eyepieces for binoculars,The Canon 18x50 IS binoculars are a great addition to the human eye. The antifog eyepieces are over priced and should have a better and more secure attachement to the eye pieces. If you use glasses and roll the eyepieces back on themselves the antifog elements can easily fall out. This is not good especially in the forest or out in a canoe or kayak.
5,good choice,"This is our choice of Bible's to give away to people who are seeking the truth or for those that we hope to encourage to seek the truth. The introduction is well written, it is geared toward those that are seeking the truth, hence the title, ""The Seekers Bible"". It is only the New Testament, we find this to be good for people who do not know Jesus, it's an introduction to the One who gave His life so that we could have true and eternal life. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except through Him (re:John 14:6)."
5,excellent lovely hardhappy,rinsimus maximus is the ultimate drum and bass/jungle record. i've had it for two years and CAN NOT GET TIRED OF IT. it's powerful deep happy...one of my all time best buys
3,First Impression,Just got the this wok delivered. I'm surprised on how thin the metal wall actually is and hope this doesn't affect the product performance. The handles are very poorly attached to the wok so I would not use it to carry the wok with anything heavy on it. Going to cook with it soon and will post a new review.
5,GREAT HANGERS!!!!,"These hangers are FANTASTIC! Anyone who says that they are too weak to hold pants or jackets is crazy! I'd say that they are three or four times stronger than any plastic hanger that I have ever seen.I literally threw out all of the old, crappy hangers in our house and bought 150 of these to replace them. And the GREATEST part is that they are made in the USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus they were less money than the crappy Made in China hangers at w*lmart!Buy them with confidence!"
3,JFK. DALLAS. OSWALD. CASTRO. AGAIN. AND NOT BAD AT THAT,"Though this reexamination of the variety of conspiracy theories contradicting the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible for the tragedy in Dallas is dry and academic in places, there's enough archival footage to get any history buff excited. There's not only a digitally remastered version of the still-gruesome Zapruder film, but also a really fine setting of the times, describing the powers of the Mafia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cuba, the USSR and the right-wing in America, separately and together motivated to remove the young, popular president. Historian Arthur Schlesinger and writer Jack Anderson provide interesting anecdotes and comments, and, while no specific theory is completely embraced, the DVD remains a fascinating look at a painful and troubling part of our history."
4,"A little intense, but worthwhile.","JFK: A Revisionist History helps the viewer to understand that the [...] of John F. Kennedy was far more complex than having been committed by a lone, crazed gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald. In fact it makes a good case for the whole thing not having been committed by Oswald at all. This even goes into all the political events and those who may (or may not) have played a part in doing this horrific act. It also goes into a lot about the autopsy and whether the shot to the President's head did damage that looked like this or that. It also explains something about who may have controlled things and why, so that the Warren Commission was so resolute in it's final assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole shooter, inspite of the overwhelming amount of information to the contrary. A very good DVD to see to add further information to the knowledge on this event in history."
3,Okay,A little too long. Good parts and very informational. I enjoyed the chapters that covered Castro through the Cuban Missile Crisis.
4,Better than Usual,"The DVD fills in a lot of vacant spots in common books on the assassination of JFK. Not all, but many. Samuel Kritzberg"
4,"Mostly 60's-era Ellison, and very good","This is one of the stronger Ellison collections I've come across. The keepers include the late 50's science-fiction adventure nasty ""Run For the Stars"" and the classic ""A Boy and His Dog."""
2,'Swamp Zombies' Wallows in the Bog,"I always want to give small-time filmmakers credit for at least trying, but after a string of lower-than-low budget zombie flicks (Quick & The Undead, Zombiez, Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium and Legion Of The Dead just to name a few), I beg the question: when will the madness end??We all know the classic zombie formula: lifeless corpses + strange expriement gone wrong = the rampaging undead. I just wish that the directors would also pay attention to a little something called pacing. I'd much rather see 70 minutes of a tight storyline than 120 minutes of unnecessary scenes and useless dialogue. Also, the acting. How do those performances EVER make it to print??It's snickers and giggles straight to the end. The real horror doesnt begin until the Special Features. Yes, those taped auditions? Downright cringeworthy. But despite all the doom and gloom of Swamp Zombies, I will say that the fighting sequences were clever and refreshing."
2,daltex,I'm disappointed. I thought this DVD was a 2DVD set. The box states that also. The bonus DVD (James Brown) was not in the package. B.B. king did three songs then exited. What a waste of vinyl space.
2,DON'T BUY,"THIS IS THE WORST SLICER, AS OTHER REVIEWS SAY, THE WIRE DOES'NT FIT WHEN SLICING, YOU HAVE TO FORCE IT INTO GROOVE TO COMPLETE THE SLICE, ALSO IF YOUR SLICING A SMALL SQUARE AND NOT A WEDGE,WHICH IS THE MAJORITY, IT PUSHES THE CHEESE AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT THERE WHILE PUSHING BOARD TO FIT THE WIRE IN THE GROOVE. THERE ARE BETTER SLICERS FOR THE MONEY, THE HANDHELD WAND SEEMS TO BE ALOT BETTER!"
2,Not the best,I liked the compact size but the cheese gets stuck inside the wooden crevice and makes it difficult to clean.
2,Too small,"When our cheese board broke, I ordered this one to replace it. This one was extremely small; my husband couldn't even get the piece of gouda to set on the board. The cheese slicer also appeared flimsy. We returned it and ordered a marble slab slicer. Amazon was great with the return."
4,Natural utility beechwood cheese slicer,I haven't used the slicer yet but am sure it will be very useful to me. Even though I haven't used it I would recommend it to anyone.
2,BEGINNER ONLY!,"This movie is very dated, and shows only 3 turns and 2 (outdated) walking styles. Only for those who know NOTHING about runway walking. More of a comedy film than a serious teaching element. I learned more by watching runway shows from the internet than I did watching this movie. I would say don't purchase it, rent or borrow if you can, and make sure you have your remote handy to fast-forward through the extraneous 28 minutes of the 30 minute film."
2,dissapointed,"I saw Evelyn perform at the Olympic Opening Ceremony and was mesmerized, but the CD was a disappointment. A little too out there for my taste."
4,Good broadcaster (Earthway),Good durable broadcaster. A little difficult to assemble and a bit pricey but otherwise I was satisfied. It held up well through some heavy use.
2,Heaviness,"I like the idea of this cultivator, but as someone who is having problems with wrist,finger arthritis issues, I found this item to be to heavy to use easily. I'm also not to sure how the ergonomic part plays in, but since it's kind of hard for me to use and feels awkward, it probably won't see much use for me."
3,none,"No significant input, just bought product needed and now must to do this to stop the dunning e-mails which seem unnecessary to me."
1,Don't Bother,"Our book club chose this book based on book reviews promising that it would be funny and entertaining. A couple of members read the whole thing, just because , but most of us abondaned this read before we finished it. There are just too many books that are more entertaining."
2,Look else where.,"I felt like I was ten years old again being scolded by my mother while reading this book. The author manages to be as demeaning as possible to adults who read it. With continous comments like are you sure you're responsible enough to have a pet? Maybe you should try a fish. Comments like this are relentless throughout the book. It was like the author wanted to make you feel like a retard or something.However, that's not to say that the book is without its merits (hence the 2 stars not just one). There's allot of information here on caring for your Japenese Chin as well as some interesting history on the species. Anyway, if your alright with being spoken to as if you were a 2 year old you can't go wrong with the price. Just be forewarned, the author is down right irritating at times. To the author: I wouldn't be purchasing the book if I didn't already have the dog, stop with the lecturing already!"
3,Good information,"Gives lots of information, nice pictures. If you know alot about the breed already, this is not the book for you. Most of the information is readily available elsewhere. If you are a novice to the Japanese Chin Breed, then this is a good start. Lots of information in one place."
4,Japanese Chin Lover,I have recently become the owner of a Japanese Chin and found the guide very comprehensive as to the care of this breed of dog. Helpful hints and tips to successfully ensure the health and well being of the dog. I enjoyed it very much.
4,Gran ayuda!,"Para todos los padres que queremos ayudar a nuestros niños a alcanzar su maximo potencial sin sobre exigencias ni penurias. De facil lectura, ameno e interesante."
5,Best seat.,"I'm a bigger guy who has had quite a few saddles on my bike. This has been the best saddle I've ever owned. It will only feel better as I get lighter I suspect. 26 miles in 2 days and no bum soreness at all. A must have for any male. It also looks stylish. My wife has a very comfortable Bell brand saddle, but it does not look like a young mans saddle."
3,A little heavy and bulky,This seat is just OK. It is on the heavy side and bulky. I would recommend shopping around and finding a gel filled seat that doesn't have the heavy springs. I returned the product.
4,Not a bummer,My bum is thankful for this seat. I'm a big-un. Happy to find a seat that is comfortable yet functional.
4,Comfort for long rides,"I'm about 5'10 220 pounds and every weekend I bike about 65 or more miles. This seat makes riding the rough streets of New York so much more enjoyable. Before I found this seat my rear and back would be aching during and long after the ride. It is much heavier than the stock seat that came with the my Scott Sub 20 but its well worth it. I tried many other padded seats, this one may not be the lightest but I feel that it is the most comfortable.The large springs in the back of the seat makes it very hard to impossible to attach a seat bag."
5,Great Improvment,"I'm no bike pro, some casual beach cruses and a little 10 miles exercise a few times a week on a mountain bike. This seat is comfortable, doesn't cause any pain unlike my last few seats. I would purchase again."
4,Good with an *,"The seat is really as good as those at twice the price. My problem, and it is MY problem, is the abrasion to the crotch. This seat is more comfortable to the buns and other areas but still chafes some sensitive areas. I've tried several and will stick to this and lubricant as the seat is, otherwise, super."
4,Truth in advertising,Decent for the price. Much better than the saddle it replaced. Four stars because it is still not comfortable enough for my behind. It would probably be perfect for someone of average weight.
3,pretty good seat,"this is a pretty good seat, it is much more comfortable than most oem seats due to it's width and cushioning, but the springs seem to be mostly a gimmick, don't really get much ""spring"" from them, for the price it seems to be worth the money."
4,Very comfortable,"It's not a performance saddle, we should know this. It is however, very comfortable and not very heavy, if you're trying to watch weight on your bike."
5,Amazing Saddle,"When I first started riding my bike again I had stock seat and my butt was so sore after. So I invested in a gel seat cover and that alleviated some soreness. I also invested in some bike shorts which again alleviated some more soreness. Then I invested in this saddle and my whole biking experience changed. This saddle combined with the bike short, as cliche as it may sound feels like you are riding on a cloud, just floating there on the bike pedaling. I would definitely recommend this saddle to anyone who is seeking a comfortable ride on a bicycle."
5,Comfortable and well made,"I am retired now and wanted to take up riding again. The standard seat on the folding bike I purchased was a torture device and my first modification was a better seat. This is a great looking, comfortable seat and it is very well made. While there may be more comfortable seats available I think this is a great compromise between a big flat cushion and a standard bike seat. The integral springs in the seat really work and it is fully adjustable fore and aft."
3,Not a cloud to Me,"Bought this for an extended mountain bike trip. My rear did not thank me after the trip. It was better than the stock seat but did not fit me very well. I'm 6' 1"" and 200 but my 130 lb wife now has it and says it is great. Maybe not made to fit me?"
5,comfortable,"comfortable bike seat, standard installation has springs to avoid bumps, fabrice top seat so may not be great for all users though especially if left outside"
5,Comfort ride,Easy to install. Works great. I just started riding. I didn't like to ride bikes for very long in the past because it was not comfortable. I bought a new full suspension mountain bike and I immediately ordered this seat for more comfort. I was able to ride a long distance without having any pain or discomfort. I'd recommend this seat to anyone who enjoys riding on road or off road.
3,Really big and heavy!,"If you want something big, heavy and comfortable for a ""comfort"" bike, this might be a good choice. I found it entirely too big and heavy for my purposes, however."
5,Get this now!!!,I hated biking to work. It's only a short ride but the seat that came with my bike was horrendous. I am much happier with this seat. I have had no issues with the seat fabric tearing.
2,"Falls apart when exposed to water, not great suspension.","This seat started falling apart after it was left in the rain on my bike one day. The water broke down the lycra and started tearing. Over the course of a few months, the fabric tore more and more until the whole front of the seat was exposed. the foam ripped and broke off, exposing a piece of hard plastic covered in tape. The seat was somewhat comfortable before it broke, I just wish the fabric was a little more durable.UPDATE: I purchased theSchwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bicycle Seatas a replacement, and it has served me well! It's not completely waterproof (heavy rain can seep in through the seams and be absorbed into the cushion) but it did not take long to dry. It is slightly firmer, but I highly recommend the Schwinn seat if your bike may be exposed to the elements."
3,Comfortable seat with spring,"This seat is very comfortable for my short commute ride. The stock seat on my bike was killing my sensitive area, but now the pain is gone with this new seat.It is wide enough to let me sit up right. I do need to level the seat and raise my stem.One shortage: the supporting rail underneath is a little too wide for my saddle post fixture. Had to squeeze the rails with tool during installation.Update: I am dropping the rateing to 3 star. This saddle is only for short range rading, 5 miles or less.Now I am riding on a used brooks. What a difference."
2,Not the comfort I expected,"While the saddle was lauded in some reviews, I really don't find the seat comfortable at all. I also expected more suspension and a little give on hitting a bump. It could just be the shape of my butt, but I wouldn't recommend the saddle. I should have spent a few extra bucks and gotten a better seat."
4,VERY GOOD SEAT Dont' Unscrew Spring Screws!,"Overall very good seat.But Don't loosen the spring screws under seat as someone mentioned in a previous review.I did that and when I went to lift my bike the seat came off and the internal springs popped out all over the place, and the two black screws and washers were never to be found again.Luckily I was able to find same size screws and washers otherwise I would have to get rid of seat.So it's comfortable, not as soft and spongy as I imagined or expected but I was definitely able to bike ALLOT longer than with my previous seat (22 miles!!) and 11 of those miles without the internal springs only the gel cushioning and outer springs.Having a herniated disk I didn't feel any pain or discomfort the next day, just the welcomed muscle burn in my legs, so you know actually out of 1-10 I have to give this seat a 10 and I seldom give good reviews.MVF"
5,Love Achiote and this is a convenient form,"Funny enough, I used this for dinner last night! We love the Anchiote and coriander flavors. I added some cumin along with two packets of Sazon to thawing chicken breasts. The anchiote turns the chicken a lovely reddish orange color. I dipped the breasts in flour and pan fried them in a dash of oil with green peppers and onions. Hmmmm- good. It reminded us of our favorite cuban/latin restaurant. The packets are easy to use. Just sprinkle it any where which is easier than the ""chunks"" of anchiote. Thanks, Knorr."
2,decent pot assembly but cheap product,The revolution burner broke during assembly very easily. I thought this product was made for the outdoors. I e-mailed the company and asked for a replacement before thanksgiving and they told me that would not be possible but they will send me a replacement. I had to purchase another burner assembly for thanksgiving and still have not recieved a replacement part 45 days later. I will not purchase anything from this company again!!
3,It didn't come with all the items pictured.,This was a fathers day gift so I haven't used it. There are 2 pans pictured that didn't come with the fryer. Very disappointing.
5,The best,"This is one of the best rendition's of Orff's Carmina Burana that is currently to be found. Sweeping, moving, the music has an almost magical quality to it. At times sounding very reminiscent of the ""Conan the Barbarian"" soundtrack, this is excellent music. The theme song, ""O Fortuna,"" was featured on Williams' Summon the Heroes CD. This CD is an excellent, wonderful, brilliant piece that everyone should own."
1,Why Rhino?,"First of all, let me just say that I'm not bashing the series at all. I loved this set and it was great to see the old episodes again. The reason why I'm giving it such a low rating is because Rhino foolishly feels the need to add those stupid BLAM! (Warpath imitation) sound effects to every episode in the series. I mean come on, machine gun sound effects when the Transformers are supposed to be using lasers?! Fortunately in Season Two Part 1 I could switch the output to stereo 2.0 and the added sounds were gone. But I tried that in this set and ZINGO! nothing changed! Someone should tell Rhino to just release the episodes as they originally aired and not to screw with them. Why can't people just leave these poor shows alone? First it was that god awful computer-generated cube thing that would take chunks out of episodes with those stupid transition effects, and now this. ..."
3,2nd Season Stinks (Episodic for the A.D.D. Impaired),"Season 2 (Parts 1 & 2) is pretty lame compared to Season 1 (the best) and Season 3 (most epic).I really love some the characters that came in Season 2. The Gestalts (combiners), Dirge, Ramjet, Thrust, Blitzwing and Astrotrain.But then you get Seaspray, Beachcomber, Cosmos(Peter Laurie), Tracks, and Warpath (Plow, I suck, Bam!).Thankfully the Movie saved the show. Which brings about Season 3, with it's continuous story line.If you can score a copy of The Headmasters, forget about Season 4 also.I actually sold Season 2 Pt 1 used on Amazon for 90 bucks and bought this whole set for 86 bucks: TRANSFORMERS Generation 1 (G1) : Complete DVD Box Set 15 Discs (98 Episodes+The movie) (In Chinese with Secondary English Audio Track)"
1,Only last 1/3 as long as authentic Sennheiser,"I've been using these a few weeks now. They only last about 1.5 hours, whereas my real Sennheiser batteries last nearly 5 hours. These are cheaper but who cares? What's completely unforgivable is that the seller makes it look like you are buying real Sennheiser. Never again. Make sure you are buying Sennheiser - and of course pay the $20 price."
1,Not the product that was pictured,"I ordered this battery from this vendor based on the price and the fact that the picture was clearly the original equipment manufacturer's. But what I received was not an OEM battery. When I rated the purchase with a low score, I received an email offering a refund -- that's a plus. But I don't appreciate receiving a product different that what's advertised."
5,"Don't ""hold back"" from snapping up the latest WriteGirl tour de force!","Honest, evocative, inspiring pieces from a group of female Los Angeles teens and their mentors. Stories and poems that jump off each page, grab you by the shoulders, and say, ""Listen up!"" A gift."
4,Nothing Held Back,As a high school teacher this book has given me a deeper understanding of what my female students go through. Each page has its own story.
1,HE NEVER FAILS TO DISAPPOINT,"IF YOU LIKE PARODIES, TRAVESTIES, CLUELESS SCRIPTS, GRATUITOUS FEMALE NUDITY AND A HILARIOUS FINALE IN WHICH THE ""GREEK"" PROTAGONISTS KILL EACH OTHER WITH GUNS (THANK GOD THIS TURKEY IS DEAD!), BY ALL MEANS, WASTE YOUR MONEY, IF YOU RESPECT THE GREEK CLASSICS, RICHARD STRAUSS, EUGENE O'NEILL AND IRENE PAPAS, DO NOT TOUCH WITH A TEN FOOT POLE. A VERY BAD DIRECTOR WITH ONE GOOD MOVIE: THE RED AND THE WHITE."
2,Boring Hippy Art Piece,"This is a boring film, namely because it spends its entire devotion to Hungarian dancers. I can't say that I was enthralled, its rather dated, from the 1970's and attempts to merge Marxist dialectics with modern drama and it fails miserably. Although it is commendable only for its art leanings, nothing else......"
2,"Decent, but needs a lot of work","I used this book for a Biochemical Engineering course in the Chemical Engineering department. The book covers a wide range of topics in the field, including a section at the end dealing with an economic analysis of various processes which I found quite useful. What the book is really lacking are worked out example problems - there are very few throughout. Also I would have liked solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter. Some of the coverage is very thin on a few topics, sometimes leaving derivations or other formulas unexplained, so I had to rely on the lectures to cover the topics more in depth."
2,"A solid reel, but the drag is a drag.","Penn has made a very solid reel in the Slammer Series. However there is one design flaw, that depending on how you fish, might be a dealbreaker. I fish from the surf, not from a boat, and as a result my reels are often soaked by waves. The drag on the Penn Slammer, when it gets wet, becomes useless... basically it sticks to itself, then gets very loose, then sticks... not smooth like it operates when dry. As a result this reel is all but useless to me. Fishing from a boat, you may not have any issues with it at all. But for me, it's a dealbreaker."
1,Worst reel,"I'm sorry but this reel is awful. I bought 2 of them last summer and both of them broke in about 3 days. The drag was defective on both of them. One of the reels had rust on it after the second day. What are the chances of that? A friend of my bought one too, same problem. Penn makes most of their reels in China now. The quality just isn't there anymore. If you want a quality reel stick with Shimano. If I could give this reel zero stars I would."
2,Disappointed,"We bought the globe in May 2007 for my 7 year olds birthday, we loved it! However, this April we were laying in bed and couldn't figure out why the room was darker than normal- The light had gone out. We called the 1800 # on the box they sent us a letter telling us it would cost $35.00 to fix. We only paid $70. Doesn't seem fair to me... All we need is a light bulb or an led light sensor... any suggestions...It was wonderful as long as it was working"
3,"GOOD FOR LEARNING, BUT OVERPRICED!","I bought this for my 7 year old niece because she has a strong interest in astronomy. After buying and returning all the cheap planetarium sets, this toy seemed like the best option. My niece thought is was an ordinary globe until we turned out the lights. Out comes the coolest constellations ever! We had fun pointing them all out and learning their history from the internet. When my niece isn't turning out the lights, the globe just sits on a shelf, untouched. For $80, I wish Discovery channel had included an astronomy/constellation book, cd, or map/poster to go along with this. Otherwise, like a previous reviewer said, you just have an overpriced night light. I loved my niece's reaction, but this globe is worth no more than $29.95."
4,cool globe,"I bought this globe for my middle school classroom and my kiddos really love it! It is well-drawn, and doesn't have the legend covering Easter Island, where people live (that happens often and it really bugs me!!) When it's dark in the room, the constellations light up and it looks super cool. I recommend it!"
5,Great gift,This was a gift for my niece. She loves it and uses it every night as a night light. Very cool.
5,Everything the schipperke owner needs to know!,"I always found my friend's schipperkes quirky and inaccessible -- but then i babysat a schip puppy when a pal went on vacation ... and fell in love.Now I own two of the little buggers, and they're the best dogs I've ever owned. I've owned Labs (2), a Bulldog, a Golden Retriever and several Muts (3).The thing about schipperkes is, they are a bit quirky -- but worth the effort that it takes to get to know them. This book is an excellent way to begin that learning process. It's chock full of great advice on the practicalities of owning a schipperke, plus lots of interesting side info too.Finally, it's DARN CHEAP! :) Can't beat the price."
4,Great Schipperke Book,This is a great info book for anyone interested in the Schipperke breed. We purchase a copy of Schipperkes for the new homes our pups go to. Lots of photos!
5,A Perfect Representation!,"A beautiful book with stunning photographs and information. I have many copies. And about time too!I love my little Schip, Jobey, and this book helped me understand his history, how to train him, and most importantly, how to care for him. Every word in this book about these quirky little animals is true, from stubborn to smart! I love this book!"
1,I never received my order,"I never received my order, I ordered two books and they never were delivered"
4,Incorrect Product Description,"The description here lists this as having an SDS-Max shank; it actually has an SDS(+) shank. This fact was first confirmed to me by an EMail from Milwaukee Customer Service after I noted that, although this chisel was listed in Milwaukee's catalog under SDS(+) tools, it's description there was (and still is!) also wrong.I now have three of these well-made chisels and can attest that they do fit my SDS(+) rotary hammer.I noticed that the Amazon description for the 48-62-6015 flat chisel is also wrong; Milwaukee's catalog is correct (SDS+) for this one:"
1,Not the Magic Carpet Ride from the Viper Commercial,"How many ""Magic Carpet Ride's"" are there. Apparently more than I realized. If you have seen the current Viper Commercial, you probably cannot help but have a very cool version of Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet Ride stuck in your head. I know I do. I guess I will remain cursed because this stupid CD by Mighty Dub Catz or whatever the hell they are called is straight up not it. Very disappointed. Does anyone what to by this stupid thing off me?"
4,"for your dancing plesere, it's a dance starter",You can enjoy up to 12 remixs of this version of the majic carpet ride and still keep on dancing the night a way! This is a house style of music at the begining then mixes in with latin style of trumpets and backround lyics. In the last part of the song it goes back the the house style and then for the final part it goes back to the latin style of trumpets and a mix of a spanish gutar melody.
1,Where to find the song from the Viper commercial,"Thank you for your interest in our commercials.The remix ""Magic Carpet Ride"" is by Philip Steir and is available on the soundtrack from the movie ""Go"". Of course, we have modified it slightly for the commercial.Let me know if I can further assist you.Amelia Retherford Senior Staff Representative DaimlerChrysler Customer Assistance Center"
3,Viper remix of Magic Carpet Ride is found...,"It had to be someone from Wisconsin to help find the remix version of the Steppenwolf classic ""Magic Carpet Ride."" (Thanks to Manitowoc) Philip Stier took the original added a bit, subtracted a bit and came up with the most slammin' remix I have ever heard. Can't give this CD it's due instead GO right now to the GO soundtrack..."
1,Viper commercial remix finally found! But not here.,"I don't really like this version of the song all that much. For those of you looking for the Viper Commercial's remix of Majic Carpet Ride, it can be found on the soundtrack to the movie GO"
4,this was a tight cut,i always use to Bop my head to this jam.Donell Jones always brings a catchy cut every now&then&this was one of those cuts that had a cool Groove to it.
3,Underrated,"There are a few top-notch songs on this CD, including: Beside Myself, Free Will and Valley. To compare it to Yanni is absurd. This is a masterfully performed rock collection with a very serious lyrical slant. Sometimes grim but very interesting."
2,Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll...I think so!,"Fans of other Tull albums such as ""Aqualung"" or ""Thick As A Brick"" won't like this album. It is a sad attempt by Mr. Anderson to touch a part of Tull which is long gone. This album is very mellow and almost touches New Age. Fans of Yanni will love it!"
5,THE BEST TULL ALBUM SINCE SONGS FROM THE WOOD,"ROOTS TO BRANCHES is the most beautiful album tull has ever recorded.Ian's flute work is amazing throughout the album.ROOTS TO BRANCHES,RARE AND PRECIOUS CHAIN,THIS FREE WILL and DANGEROUS VEILS are terrific rockers.STUCK IN THE AUGUST RAIN and AT LAST,FOREVER are two of the most gorgeous tunes in tull history.ANOTHER HARRY'S BAR is one of those great ""old,dimly lit bar/on a rainy day"" songs.This is the album that turned me into a ""die hard"" tull fan."
4,Roots to Branches,"A fine effort by Jethro Tull, has a eastern feel to it and guitar wise it is incredible. Solid drumming and some great songs.Saw the tour and the album will grow on you."
3,A Disappointment at First Glance,"I'm not alone, I know, in saying that this album isn't one of the best. If you cringe at the first few songs (including the title song), though, don't just pack it away - the meaningful lyrics haven't been lost in any way, and as for the music... Eh. ""Valley"" is good, as is ""Another Harry's Bar"". ""Valley"" is in a style I haven't seen before, while ""Another Harry's Bar"" would be quite at home on ""Catfish Rising"" or another of their more bluesy albums. If you just can't stand the rest of the CD, at least put these two on a tape before stuffing the entire album away in the back of your closet. :)"
3,Better,"When i first heard this album i was quite disapionted, but seeing how it was Tull i decided to give it time to grow on me, which i must admit it has done to some extent, there are a couple of songs on there that are excellent, but others that leave me a bit cold, also the songs are all a bit melancholy, it could possibly have done a few happier tunes to lift it. But it is still their best album for a while, though not quite as fun and interesting as their 70`s stuff"
4,Under Rated Tull Gem,"I have to admit, this is not Tull's best album. Certainly not up there with the classics like ""Aqualung"", ""Thick As A Brick"" and ""Stand Up"". But there is much good here. The album kicks off with a great title track and then for me, weakens a bit over the next several tracks. But from ""Beside Myself"" through the closing ""Another Harry's Bar"", this is some of the best material Ian and the gents have EVER recorded. This release never quite received the credit it deserved. Great lyrics and Ian's flute playing, along with Martin's guitar work, are superb, especially through the second half of the album. I absolutely love the play between Martin's guitar and Ian's flute that closes the album on ""Another Harry's Bar"". This one is ""Another Ian's Gem"". Certainly one of ther best, after the 3 aforementioned classics."
2,Misunderstanding??,"When I ordered the map, I was under the impression that is constructed in such a way that a laminate coating would make it ""waterproof"". When it arrived, it looked like any other ordinary map. With that said, I feel the map was overpriced."
5,Best reading I've done in a while!,"Straight forward and simple--that's how this New Testament reads. The translation doesn't take liberties with The Word and quickly becomes a ""page turner""! Now, I'm looking for the same style for The Old Testament!"
1,The Student Prince,The sound quality of this RCA Victor CD (60048-2-RG) is completely sub-standard. It sounds as though the recording was made using poor quality microphones in a room next to two poor quality speakers. I know the sound from the actual movie (either on VHS or over Cable TV) is substantially better than this extra-ordinarially bad sound quality CD.I regret that I cannot recommend this CD.
4,Mario Lanza -the one & only,"It was a delight all the way to hear Mario Lanza sing again. apart from movies in the 50's & his early death, he almost seemed to drop out of sight. Thanks again for including him in your catalog."
5,Mario,"In my book, the greatest Opera singer ever and that includes Enrico. I saw the movie the Student Prince. I have never forgotten his voice."
5,Savage Realism.,"This film is unique. Violence is rampant, but it's not what carries the film. The performances from Mario Bello and Jason Patrick are as real as they are disconcerting. It's beautiful, bleak and raw. It's a love story."
2,Dark movie,"Definitely not one of Maria's best movies, I do realize it was based on a true story but not entertaining."
3,not an east watch,"Acting was superb and since it's ""based no true events"" I guess i can't complain about the plot. very disturbing, emotional movie. A very good movie but not entertaining- especially since I've known several people like Nancy."
2,Boring,The title of this book should have been How to Photograph Orbs. I could not even finish this book as it was all about orbs. The author touched slightly on too many other subjects and heavily on orbs. I was highly disappointed.
4,OK book for the beginner,"If taking pictures of orbs is all you're looking for, this is the perfect book for you. For the serious paranormal investigator, this book is rather limited. It touches on ""vortexes"" and ""ecto-plasm"" even crop circles and UFO's, however the primary focus is on orbs. On a positive note: the color photos are excellent and for that reason alone, I recommend this book!"
1,My Opinion,Was led to believe the book had all collectableslisted. It had none of my twenty items. It wasa waste of my money.
2,More Greek Myths,"Trier, who is at times an accomplished director, has an eye for great art. This film, which deals with the Greek mythology of Medea, who killed her children in order to appease the gods, is an artistic telling of the event, from deep colored shots of the ocean to lens filtered wind brushing against the actors shade, this is all visual, but the film is quite utterly boring and thus, we are not interested in the development of sequences which Trier arranges from us. Udo Kier is common in this adaptation and by the end, we are glad that the screen is no longer filled with such blatant incoehesion."
2,"Not his best, by a longshot.","First I would like to say that I have a deep knowledge of Von Trier- he was brought to my attention before any of his films saw US release by friends in europe and well before Dogme existed. This is probably the worst work I have seen from Von Trier. The film is incredibly short, and still manages to seem long and grating at points. Stylistically, themetically, and in regards to acting, this film is very strong, however it is overly minimalistic to the point of being off-putting.If you absolutely have to complete your Von Trier collection then consider purchasing this DVD, otherwise I'd recommend seeking out the complete Europa trilogy and the under appreciated Kingdom miniseries. Worth a viewing, not a purchase."
4,wall street,"this book helped give me a whole new meaningful perspective on the kennedy assasination..it sifts through all the misinformation, and the same tired trashy expose type books on the kennedy presidency that don't give any meaningful information, i am much more interested in a president's policies economic and otherwise as opposed to his sex life...i highly reccommend that anyone interested in politics, economics, or the kennedy assasination read this book twice and very slowly. gibson lays everything out clearly in an easy to understand way, i highly reccomend this book."
4,Interesting Look at JFK's Presidency and Death,"What would Gibson say now with Phillip Nelson's book and the others who paint JFK in less than a positive image? Who knows, but Gibson does give us a confirmation of some current ideas as to who and why JFK could have been killed. This is an intriguing look at one man's interpretation of current and past literature related to Kennedy."
2,Nope,"The plot idea behind Twice Damned was very interesting, vampires created to be super soldiers during WWII. Sounds great... That's the extent of the positive. The author just didn't pull it off.There was no plot development to pull us into this different idea of vampirism. The characters were developed pretty well, we got a good idea of who they were, however they wern't built as likeable characters. They were dull, drab, and I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to them one way or the other.I had to force myself to finish this book mostly because I wanted to get my money's worth. I kept reading hoping it would get better, it never did. Save your time and money on this one."
3,Twice Damned,"In the near future, a young doctor works to cure Hitler's legacy. Stoker's syndrome claimed the life of her infant brother, and in Faith's scientific opinion, gave rise the the legends of vampires. She never imagines that vampires might be real, or that the very young man hitting on her is actually old enough to be her grandfather. Ritter is one of the few survivors of Hitler's experiements to create super soldiers, and now, he and another vampire seek not only a cure, one Faith is working on without realizing its scope, but also to stop a new breed of vampires from rising. Enlisting Faith in their effort is both a blessing and risk. Before it all is over, heart breaking sacrifices will be required of them all in order to surpass the danger for the greater good.*** Fast moving action and bittersweet decisions make this a memorable book with a logical premise that makes it believeable without stretching one's credulity level to greatly. ***"
5,Amazing,Excellent product !!! excellent package !!! I have no complaints with the product or with your dealer !!! !!! !!!
5,Fantastic book,At first I had a hard time getting into this book but I kept reading only to find I couldn't put it down. This book made my heart ache for the victims. I highly recommend this book.
5,Brass Ring,Excellent book. Diane chamberlain captures you from the first page and keeps you captivated until the end. Really gives you something to think about.
2,Just So So,This book was about childhood sexual abuse and repressed memories. Ms. Chamberlain is one of my favorite authors but I did not care for this one. I found Claire to be extremely unlikeabe and did not understand her at all. Also the book was too lengthy and dragged at points.
3,Not up to par,"I have read every single Diane Chamberlain book, and eagerly awaited this one as well. Ms. Chamberlain has been my favorite author (right in front of Maeve Binchy, Anne Rivers Siddons, and Joan Medlicott) for several years. That said, this book did not read like her other books at all, and I have to honestly say that for the first time ever, I was disappointed in a Diane Chamberlain book. Will I buy another of her books - absolutely. She definitely deserves another chance.... Sorry, this one just wasn't up to par with the other amazing stuff she has written."
4,This is the third book in a series,"It is not the first time, and probably won't be the last, that I have read books out of sequence. Unfortunately this was the third in a series of three and I had not yet read the first two before starting this one. However, although I still haven't read the other two, I don't think they necessarily need to be read in order and I am look forwarding to reading The Keeper of the Light, and its sequel. I once read on the Author's blog that she puts a lot of time and effort into constructing the end, and being an ""end reader"" (I can't resist turning to the last page when I am about a third through a book), I felt quite guilty. I constrained myself with this book and did not read the end until the very last page. I must say it was a pleasant surprise not to know what was going to happen until then. Another superb book from Diane Chamberlain."
5,9 Foot Worm Makes Own Food,I used to have this figure but it got lost (with several others) during a cross country move. Amazon to the rescue. They not only had it but the fates smiled upon me and I got the last one. And the price can't be beat. $9.99. If I bought the figure in a comic store mint in package it would have easily set me back $25/30.00. And the delivery was extremely prompt. In fact I got it so soon I actually waited until Christmas Eve to open it lol.She now resides atop my dresser with other figures I've been able to reacquire from Amazon and other places.All in all this was one of the most feel good experiences of 2008.
5,I love Charmed,I love everything Charmed... I wanted to complete my collection. The doll is very unique. It has very intricate design and the face really resembles Paige! Love it!
5,The art work appeals to me,"I remember Raggedy Ann and Andy from the time I was just big enough to be fascinated by the bright pictures. Frankly, this review is more about nostalgia than anything else. I still love the soft, simple, drawings. Gruelles stories are aimed at the under 7 year olds; but they do appeal to that age group. Simply put, I like the art work. I remember, as a very young child, liking the stories too. If you are buying out of nostalgia or for the very young reader, I highly recommend Gruelles work."
2,Product OK... Unhappy Consumer!,"Looking at the product's image, I originally thought the price was for three cases. The description was not clear when I originally purchase. I read all the reviews just to be sure. One past review by (Claudia Baptista on May 17, 2010) stated she received three cases. I thought that was good deal. Boy I was wrong. As a result of contacting the seller regarding my complaint, the seller added a product feature section stating that now it was for a single case, not three.In regards to the product itself, just too major negatives, which in hindsight, would prevent me on purchasing this product.-Marble black case does not have breathable holes.-Total price with shipping is expensive. Shipping cost is more than the product itself."
4,It's a plastic case for a mouthguard,"So if that's what you're expecting, you'll be pleased. If you though it was a going an ipad then you're going to be unpleasantly suprised.Good size, sturdy case. Closes well and has never popped open yet. Interestingly enough I ordered two of these (one for me and one for the wife) and one had drainage holes in it (to let water out). They should have been identical, so I'm not really sure what happened there. Doesn't really matter, but just thought I'd let you know!All in all we're both pleased with these. Again, you can't play ""Angry Birds"" with it, but it WILL hold your mouthguard."
5,Good Dental Case,The best thing you can do is buy these when the braces come off and the retainer starts. I bought three of the blue cases for my son. I don't want to replace retainers.
1,Too small.,"I put the denture in. I tried to close it. It doesn't close. My denture is too high.I'm keeping it in case I get a new one that might fit, but I do not have high hopes."
3,Thanks to Five Hundy by Midnight for exposing me to this album!,"I listen to a Las Vegas podcast called Five Hundy By Midnight. Tim and Michelle played ""Christmas in Vegas"" by Louie, Louie on their Dec 9th show. I liked the song so much I bought the album! The price is worth Louie Louie's track alone, the other songs are OK, but not to my liking.This is everything I love: Las Vegas, Christmas, and a near-timeless song about the beauty of Las Vegas around my favorite time of year.I suggest you give the songs a listen; the album has something for everyone.Thanks again, Tim and Michelle!"
1,Generic Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Unfortunately, there were no reviews on this album to inform the customer that this is strictly music - not recordings of the show tunes (with singing). From the description and grouping on the website, it seems to be selected songs from the shows. I was very disappointed! The generic sounds of whatever ""orchestra"" did the recordings make them all sound alike. If you need music to sleep by, this would be a good start."
4,Sea Siren,"Lovely Latina Kiki Figueroa is dressed as a mermaid, advertising for her new restaurant, La Sirena, when Tino Suarez first spots her. He rescues her from an overly forward admirer, and thus begins a relationship. Both Kiki and Tino are wary of entanglement, but he is much more gun-shy than she. What a delicious treat this 4 1/2 star story is! The characters, even incidental ones, are exquisitely drawn, making this a marvelous night's read. Thank you, Ms. Vasquez!"
1,full of defects,"I actually bought two HP 17Bii+'s - one for home and the other for work. Funny thing is, I'm seeing completely different defects on each one. My work HP, for instance, has trouble with the #0 key - you really need to watch the repeater to make sure it's getting all the digits. My home HP? Already crashed dead - twice - requiring me to reset and lose all my formulas. Without the reliability, I can't recommend this product."
1,Very disappointed at quality of keyboard,"When I purchased this model, I was really excited about buying my first professional calculator. It turns out that the keyboard doesn't work reliably - even when you hear the key click. Also, the key clicks are really noisy and cheap-sounding... more so that any calculator I have ever used."
1,K-mark calculator indeed,"I am very disappointed. This is just not the same quality as what a HP calculators used to be. The case and keys feels like they are made of cheap plastic(one that used in plastic poons and forks). I agree it looks nice but try holding it and use it.In my case, one of the key did not even work. I had to press and kept the pressure on for 1 second to get the calculator to pick up the stroke. Luckily I paid a bit more for it from a good dealer in Hong Kong and they let me have a replacement the second day I took it back(not to be taken for granted in this part of world). As the product is so badly made, I found I have to look at the LCD every time I press a key to make sure what I pressed actually got picked up! Is HP going the cheap way now?"
2,Poor quality. Nice solver function.,"Mine stopped working after 3 weeks. I'm sure HP's reputation will be seriously hurt by the poor quality of their new models. They should fire the guys who apparently made the decision to compromise quality for lower costs.The best thing about this calculator is the solver function, which lets you store user-defined functions. If it wasn't for that, this calculator would be way behind the TI BAII+ in my opinion.I like the menu-driven interface, the efficient keystrokes, and the solver function. The HP17BII+ seems to lack some of the statistical functionality of the TI BAII+. Curiously, it is missing some very basic stat functions, like population standard deviation.If it wasn't for the quality problems, I would have given it 4 stars."
2,drained batteries in one month,"The calculator is very easy to use and is much faster than my HP 12C. Unfortunately the two CR2032 batteries died within one month of light use. This is not an isolated incident, many of my classmates are having the same problem. Unless you carry spare batteries around, I would suggest you use any calculator than this one."
3,works,"honestly only used it for class and even then, it wasn't that useful. idk who in their right minds would pay 100 bucks for this when you can just use your brain and a regular graphic calculator or scientific calculator that you'd probably have at home."
4,Updated Review,"I have used HP financial calculators for many years. I have had this one for 3 1/4 years. The ""touch"" of the keyboard has held up quite nicely and I have always liked the way it works, especially the ability to use RPN input. My only complaint is that the screen blanks out on this one now making it quite useless. Having spent $80. for the calculator, I did not view it as disposable. Lasting a bit over three years is just not good enough. In my desk, I have one of HP's oldest models (the 12C). It dates back to the 1970's and lacks functions that I need, but works perfectly.Update: I went ahead and bought a new one, only to learn that the problem with the old one was bad batteries. They tested 5 out of 6 (Pass) on a tester, but perhaps the voltage was down. Therefore, I was too quick to blame HP. Also, the new one has a slightly updated look to it and still uses the same quality keys. If you need mortgage, amortization calculations, etc., this is a good choice for you."
4,HP 17bII+ improvement,"This new version of the 17bII+ is an improvement from the previous 17bII+. HP improved the buttons and increased the size of the Input button. This is the 4th HP calculator I've purchased. I'd recommend it (has the appearence of the 12C Platinum). Don't buy the 17bII+ with the smaller Input button. The buttons are of poor quality (I have one & don't use it). All said, the old 17bII is the best version, if you can find on web. Best buttons & quality.This is the best financial calculator on the market."
2,HP 17BII+ Not Up to HP Standards,"I've always had good luck with HP products, but the HP 17bII+ is a bit of a clunker. The problem is that the keys are what can only be described as 'sluggish.' Meaning that it sometimes takes 2 key presses in order to be recognized. As you might imagine, this causes a LOT of errors. Rather than being able to use the calculator as one might do, that is, without really having to concentrate on the device itself, the HP 17bII+ forces you to take your mind off your real task in order to make sure that key presses are properly registered. Sorry, but I can't recommend this product.One other thing... I DID call HP customer service about this a few months ago. They had me remove the batteries and do a complete reset of the static memory. It seemed to solve the problem for awhile, but eventually it returned."
2,Terrible compared to previous version!!,"I owned an HP 17B II for 18 years (yes, one calculator actually lasted that long!) and I loved it. It did everything I needed it to do, the buttons and display all worked great, and I noticed that it was built in Singapore. Well, the old thing finally died earlier this year and I bought a new HP 17 BII+, which I noticed was made in China. What a disaster! Half the time when I push the buttons, the machine doesn't register anything! That can be a major problem when working with a calculator, because you have to wonder all the time whether the machine actually has all the correct data inputs. I hate this calculator, but I still love the functionality of the HP 17B II. I can't wait for HP to come out with a new version, hopefully built somewhere that cares about quality! I'm really disappointed in HP for charging $80 for a calculator that isn't flawlessly made."
3,Mediocre Upgrade,"I bought the HP 17BII+ to replace and to upgrade my HP 19bII folding calculator. And for the money I spent (about the same, 12 years later), I'm a little disappointed. Going down from 4 lines of display, to 2 lines of display, the buttons feeling cheaper and the removal of unit conversion for measurements. But on the plus side, everything else seems to be the same and the battery cover doesn't look like it is going to fly off."
5,Adding immediate value,"The command layout for this calculator flows very naturally. It was a welcome relief from unnecessarily complex commands, and Polish notation. Well worth the few extra dollars. It goes above and beyond any other financial calculator by-far."
2,Not Recommended,"I bought one and returned it. The device is a little too large. Why does it have to be so big? And with the case it is REALLY big. I think calculators should fit in the pocket.For the price, why isn't the display clearer? Why didn't they include a handy conversion tool for length, speed, weight, etc.?Questions, questions, questions...."
4,i love this calclulator..,"Best thing about this calculator that it is user friendly in navigating, you can easily find your way through its menus.Unlike the Texas instruments BA 2 calculators.Another excellent feature is that it's programmable, typing & saving your own formulas and again very easy to navigate on this and finding your results.It is fast in producing results, haven't calculated time for sure but really never felt that it took more than 2 or 3 seconds to get the answer. Well i mainly use bond and TVM functions on it plus other formulas i already saved on it.Only draw back is like many reviews are saying the buttons can sometimes skip the entry. Normally this can cause big problems however your fingers just get acquainted with it's button press sense by time, as well as your eye check.As a whole it gets the job done easily, fast and in style. I love my HP 17B 2+ calculator"
5,Worth to money,"I've used this calculator more than 3 years. As a financial sector worker, it is the one you're looking for.Definitely worth the money. Do not hesitate to buy it.."
2,Bring back the old 17BII!,"My tried and true 5 year old 17BII was stolen recently and I had to replace it. I was surprised to find that HP no longer offered it for sale (big mistake; never take a classic of the market). As the new 17BII+ was my only option (absent tapping the used market) I gave it a shot. At first, the features made it look like an upgrade (currency converter, etc.) however, once I started using it I noticed one very major flaw: the new buttons simply do not work. They stick/don't connect resulting in approximately 20% of my keystrokes not registering. This calculator became so frustrating to use, I ended up trading it away to my unsuspecting office-mate for his banged-up, but still perfectly functioning 5 year old 17BII. Recommendation: buy a used 17BII (even an old one) instead of this thing."
3,Does what it is supposed to,"If I had to buy a financial calculator again, I would get the classic 12c. I needed the calculator for MBA accounting classes and found the 17BII+ adequate. I would have rather bought the 12c for less money. As a cosmetic note, the slightly curved sides of the calculator annoy me."
1,Find something else but not a HP 17bII+,Once a proud owner of a 19BII this is about as close as you get as a replacement. It is not worth the money. The buttons work poorly so you must exercise extreme care when keyboarding or you will have input errors. Today the display cracked not due to abuse but the clasp for the case hits right where the display broke. HP will not replace this calculator because they consider this abuse or customer damage versus a poorly thought out design. I am going to try TI after this disappointment.
3,Cumbersome,"Although this calculator has a powerful equation solver, it is a little cumbersome to use. I prefer 12CP for quick calculations, 50g for more complex jobs. And for any other situations where I have access to computer, I rather use Excel.-revision 8/3/2008I've used the original 17bii from 1992 until lost it in 2000. Bought a replacement 17bii+ but sold it because of bugs and other problems. It felt very cumbersome. Bought 12CP and liked it for a while but unless you use it everyday, you forget how to use it (not intuitive). After awhile it became hard to use, especially with cash flow problems. Just couldn't remember how to use it when I needed it.Just purchased this silver model for my graduate finance class. This silver model with correct ""Input"" (enter) key fixed all previous bugs and works perfectly. Even the keys feel much better. Now I don't have to wonder if my answer is correct or now. I can easily review all entries quickly."
1,Not Impressed,"Bought 17B2+ as replacement for my old 17B2. There may be new features in the 17B2+, but all I really wanted was the old features. The most important feature I wanted was for the calculator to actually work.The 17B2+ had clunky keys, which I didn't like but I could live with.The 17B2+ also had the annoying habit of ignoring the first keystroke I input. Maybe they have a ""sleep"" function for powersaving if the calculator isn't used for a period. If so, somebody screwed up in the implementation. But, I can live with this too.Now, after about a year, the calculator is resetting every other day, so I have to re-program all my Solver functions (yes, I did change the batteries....).HP calculators were well made, from the design right through to product quality. That was then.....Time to go back to the store and yell until I get my money back."
1,Bad Service...,I bought this calculator and it stopped working after 40 days. I tried new batteries too. The company wouldn't take a return since it was over 30 days! I had the earlier version of this calculator and it lasted me over 18 years. I can't beleive they didn't take it back after several complaints/emails. Buy from somewhere else.
4,AWESOME CALCULATOR,This is an AWESOME financial calculator. I almost gave it five stars but you can never be perfect. As a novice to finance calculators I found this one very easy to learn and use. If you're looking for a business calculator this is the one.
2,I'm bummed!!!,"Bought this one since I lost my 17BII and am hugely DISAPPOINTED! Not only is the feel no longer solid, but the KEYS DON'T REGISTER THE ENTRY many times which means you have to continuously double check that the number was entered. UNACCEPTABLE! Reminds me of the TI scientific calculators that I bought in the early 1980's. Same problem and I'm sure this calculator will wind up in the same place. the Trash!!"
1,Keypad problems after 2 days of use :-(,"The keypad did not even last 2 days. I can not use the 6th ^ key any more. It works one out of 5 attempts.Now, I have to try to get a replacement or my money back.Gerardo"
5,i have yet to put this calculator through its paces,"i haven't worked this calculator very hard, but i have been using basic functions for months and so far the screen is fine (not backlit, so this is not a good calculator to use in the dark) and the buttons have registered my every touch.my Broker made me buy it and he likes it a lot.*update 5/2/12 Over seven years later this calculator is still going strong! It has gotten me totally addicted to Polish notation and I feel a little lost when I ever have to do math without it. The buttons are not quite as sensitive as they used to be, but what the heck - it's been seven years!"
4,a very good financial calculator,"The HP 17BII, is one of the best financial calculator that i've known.., and the most important, very easy to use it.. in silver, is very elegance too."
3,Great movie. Lousy DVD.,Madadayo from the great director Akira Kurosawa may be a 5 star movie but this DVD looks like Fox Lorber mastered it from a VHS tape.
2,What a revolting development!,"Too bad Kurosawa's last movie is such a schlocky treacle-fest. I understand that he wanted to write a kind of final love letter to his fans and admirers and students, but this one went just a bit too far for my tastes. Kurosawa is not a stranger to saccharine sentimentality (witness REDBEARD), but this one went a step too far in its Pollyanna-like optimism. Faced with the tragedy of WWII (briefly covered and hardly mentioned), the literature professor who is the film's protagonist rises above his setbacks with his steadfast stoicism and optimism and the help of his loving male students who shower him with admiration, gifts, land, and a new home. I had thought Spielberg the master of the cloyingly sweet movie, but it looks as if he learned his nausea-inducing licks from the old master himself. If you like hard-edged reality, or are a fan of Kurosawa's starkly delineated films of old, avoid MADDADAYO. Can't wait to get this one out of my library."
3,Wow...very difficult,"As a Kurosawa and Japanese cinema fan in general - and a student of Japanese language for over 20 years - I had a hard time getting through this movie. It's not that it's a bad movie, it's just really directed at a very specific audience in my opinion. Older people who have a sentimental attachment to the songs, humor and overall mood of the period. I could appreciate some of the humor where if I was dependent solely on the captions would be totally lost.The film making is marvelous, the framing, the cinematography, casting, etc. are all top notch. If you appreciate Japanese culture and have an understanding of the language to some degree, it can be enjoyed (but I did find myself fast forwarding here and there) - but don't sit down with the (American) family on this one. They will all eventually disburse or fall asleep!! The closing scene is masterful, as many have stated."
5,Madadayo,"Akira Kurosawa's atypical swan song, unabashedly sentimental and set on a small, intimate stage, reflects the director himself at twilight, confronting his own impending mortality. (Kurosawa actually passed away five years after the film's debut, at age 88). Mirroring the astonishing journey and legacy of its prodigious director, this deceptively simple film is a moving affirmation of a life richly lived, and the respect and admiration that comes with the wisdom of experience. It would be a shame to miss the uplifting joys--and occasional sorrows-- of ""Madadayo."""
2,"Live, one Vince Neil song only","I'm an idiot. I buy anything Motley Crue. I think Nikki Sixx could fart into a tape recorder and I'd probably pay $14.99 for it. I need help. The fact that I bought this is proof.It's not so bad. It's basically a Motley live album, since all the songs (minus one) are Crue tunes. That's OK, but I'm sure there are lots of fans who would agree that it would have been much more exciting to get a live CD of mostly Neil solo tunes. I've got Motley live stuff. 99% of the folks who bought this CD probably do, too. Give me something different.I read somewhere that Vince commented that there would have been more solo songs on the record, but the tapes got lost. I don't think so. I've seen Vince on every solo tour he's done, and he hasn't performed his own material in YEARS. The last time he played primarily VN songs, Steve Stevens was still in the band.I'm going to stop writing now. I've already put more effort into my review than Vince did in this CD."
2,"No one like Mick, Tom n Nikki","I think Vince should find real musicians for his band. There is too much Wah in the songs, but the sound is raw with no corrections or anything, which makes a live recording sound ""live"". I am not very familiar with the Look in her eyes song, but it sounds good, but the rest of the songs are not interpreted with the feel that Mick plays them. Samantha plays better the drums than this guy, and tha bass I could hardly hear it, buy it to complete your Motley/Vince collection....not because it is a great cd like the rest of the Motley/Vince cds...."
1,false advertising!,"i gave this record an objective listen - this guy is ruining the motley name! this is not a vince neil album; look at the song list...if you want a live motley album, there is one you can buy. this sounds like a bad motley crue tribute band! the musicians on this record cannot hold a candle to the tight act that is the original motley crue. guitar solos are adequate at best, the bassist is weak, and the drumming is decent. i don't know why nikki and the band would put up with this. vince has solo material to draw from...his live release should include the ""vince neil"" material only, not the crue. with rumoured plans for a motley crue farewell tour in 2004, all this release does is take away from the specialness of next year."
4,Another great story...,"She was cornered: Maggie Sterline's past had caught up with her. What strange twist of fate had led her to walk unknowingly back into the lion's den? Saxon Tremayne was a hot-blooded giant of a man. What had happened betweenn them was a misundertanding, but he was determined to see her pay for everything. His price--that she stay in South Carolina and care for the man who found himself bitter and helpless in a world suddenly turned dark. But if Saxon's blind wrath was unsettling, Maggie still had the stamina to stand up to him, to force him to face his world even as his angry touch grew tender, and his kisses seemed to say that her surrender would mean more--far more--than mere revenge."
1,THIS IS NOT TRANCE,"Sure... the CD can make you dance a bit or what not, but I bought the CD under the impression that it was trance... ALICE DEEJAY IS NOT TRANCE. The cd is just a bunch of club hits (except for touch me and sandstorm, but the way they're presented they hardly sound trance). Now, being a trance head, I don't usually listen to vocals in my music, which is the first shocking part of this CD. The emphasis on vocals in many songs detracts from the over all quality! MOreover, the transitions are pure ..., they're abrupt and create a lack of flow in the CD, once again detracting. Many of the songs are hits, though hardly trance tracks, but as mixed, do not present a coherent listening experience. For a ""Trance Party"" this cd is severly lacking, but for a club or dance cd, it's OK. Dont buy it for the trance music."
5,Best Trance CD Ever!!!,"This CD is really, really good. I can listen to it over and over. I would recommend adding this CD to your collection today."
5,Good CD for listening and dancing,"OK, so a lot of the songs on this CD have been played out on the radio and the mixes aren't all that ""adventurous,"" but it is a really good compilation of trance and ""female vocal"" dance songs. For those that have complained that the mixes are only 3 1/2 to 4 minutes long, my experience has been that the extended mixes tend to get ""filler"" rather than anything really good. I would highly recommend this as one of a handful of CDs to have in your trance collection."
3,"Some good songs, some bad songs, and some lousy mixing","3 stars is somewhat generous I think. Calling this CD trance just reminds us that the word is overused. Most tracks are more of a trancey sounding pop music. Every track weighs in at a typical pop length of 3-4 minutes. If you've heard Alice Deejays ""Better Off Alone"" then you get the idea. That said, there are some good songs here, though most of them are overplayed and included on many other CD's. What I can't figure out is why the Happy Boys, whoever they are, or anyone else would want to take credit for mixing this album. A computerized mixer throwing in a generic background beat between tracks could have done just as well as one track just kind of crashes into the next. I did find one possible use for the CD. Guys, if you know a girl whom you'd like to hook on trance, start with something like Trance Party. The lighter pop sound could be a transition from cheese pop toward harder trance. It's ""trance"" that the masses have heard before."
3,Good... But not great.,"Overall, this is a decent cd to listen to. For a small party, it's something you could pop in and dance to or have in the background, but it gets old before long. The ""Happy Boys"" who mixed this thing will hopefully find another line of work. I will admit, there are a decent share of good songs here though. Kaycee's ""Escape"" is the best track on the cd and deserves more recognition as well as a place on a more deserving album; high energy and great unique sound make it a great song. Of course there is Darude's ""Sandstorm""... but if you've heard it before, you've probably heard it a hundred times, same goes for ""Better Off Alone"". If you DO like this kind of ""party trance"" then you may like this cd... for maybe 3 listens and then you will yawn, put it away in a shelf and forget it for the rest of your life."
3,a little decieving,"the book has a lot of basics in it. it has a lot about competition aerobatics and diagrams. it only shows how to do about 8 aerobatics. the rest is drawings and competition patterns in the different categories. the one very helpful article i found in it is how to take off and land in crosswinds. it shows how to do slow rolls, stall turns, spins, snap rolls, torque rolls, rolling circles, lomcevaks, and tailslides. its great if you are interested in competing (thats why i baught it). if you are looking for a book purely on how to perform various aerobatics, this isn't it."
5,"Very, very good","The book not only makes aerobatic maneuvers understandable, it's full of tips that will make you a better RC pilot. You will fly with style!"
3,It was a good book for a typical ER freak like myself.,This book was very informative and gave some commmon termonilogy that is commonly used in the show. I thought that this was a very nice touch to this book overall. It also described many of the episodes from last season ( when it was published).
2,Nice Table poor QC (or maybe design),AS the previous reviewer stated someone at Bosch dropped the ball. Leveling the router plate with the table is impossible without buying some washers and shims. Either a designer dropped the ball and spec'd the router plate insert rabbet too deep or the penny pinchers changed the length of the leveling inserts or the thickness of the router plate to save money. At any rate there is not enough adjustment to level the plate with the table top with out backing out the inserts. Every thing else about this table is nice but this is a deal breaker. I'm calling Bosch to see if they have a fix but I may just return it.
1,Avoid this table especially for smaller board routing.,I have had this table for a little over a year now and it is on the list of tools I can't stand to use. I make boxes and the plastic inserts are such low quality that nothing comes out routed evenly. They are flimsy pieces of thin plastic and even a little pressure causes them to sag as you go across them. Plus they do not line up flush with the table top so small pieces get stuck on the outfeed side. There is no way to adjust them either so you are stuck with what you have. I'm looking for a new table and happened across this table and thought it may help others avoid buying what I solemnly regret buying to begin with. I hate this table!!
3,Router table comments,"Overall quality is good. Assembly was simple. I'm using a Ryobi router with it. Disappointed that it did not include a miter guide. ""Storage cabinet"" is not very useful when it doubles as a dust collection bin. Shop vac connection is good."
4,"Good value, compact table","I did not experience the problems prior reviewers had. I was able to perfectly level the plate with the tabletop as delivered, and the kit assembled fine without any quality issues. I'd prefer it had a larger surface area, which is why I give it 4 stars, but the nice feature is the enclosed cabinet to help mute the router noise. I bought the undertable bracket mount with the above-table adjustment capability, and all works great."
3,Don't expect to use it right outta the box!,"I wonder if Bosch is getting too big to focus on their quality control. I had to return one of the MDF pieces that was damaged, and after starting to assemble, I realized that several of the pre-drilled holes were not in line. Also, some of the cuts on the MDF were out of line. The worst part: the base plate was a nightmare to level out. Finally after adding small washers as shims it was acceptable, but not flush on all sides (not sure if that was a warp in the MDF of what). I think the fence assembly seems to be good quality and all other features. I really think in retrospect I would have looked alot harder at other models, and probably would have gladly spent a few extra dollars for better quality."
2,Product Review,"I recently purchased the unit and thus far have been quite dissapointed. To start the assembly was easy but the materials were unsatisfactory, I was missing several fasteners and one of the panels was not square. The hole guard is a joke, I drew blood the first time I opened the door from the sharp edge.If you are interested in having a flat consistant surface to work from seek another unit. The table edging protrudes above the surface of the table which must be trimmed. The most significant problem is the router mounting plate is not flat. I have access to a blanchard grinder which corrected the problem.Essentually if your are looking for a cost effective table that produces work that has some variations, this is your product otherwise I would invest in a Benchdog. If I did it over again I would move to the Benchdog, After correcting the table trim problem I figured I was stuck with the unit."
2,too many lips,"The fence indicators are not precise enough. I ended up putting on sticky measuring tape. The real problem is the excess of lips. I leveled the plate to the table but there is still a gap all the way around the plate. The insert is also not level with no real way to level it. This isn't a problem when doing template routing or edge routing, but it was disastrous to my sliding dovetails and tenons.(end grain routing) I think I'm going to sell this and get a Kreg or a Benchdog table."
3,"Nice table, but the fence isn't aligned","The table is solid and well constructed. I am generally very happy with it, however the movable panels attached to the fence are not flush with each other. The left-side panel sticks out about 1/16"" compared to the right-side panel and it catches wood pushed through the bit. I chiseled away the edge to allow it to slide past, but the panel itself is still 1/16"", so the route is still uneven. It's very frustrating and I can't figure out how to fix it."
3,No You Don't Clean With Soap & Water,"I guess I should of gotten the stainless steel wok. It's really a lot of work to clean off the protective coating it comes with & then seasoning the carbon steel wok is really taking a long time. We haven't cooked with it yet. I just wanted to comment it's a real chore to clean and season this thing. You do NOT clean it with soap after it's seasoned, just hot water and a scratcher that has no soap and burn it dry. Just like a cast iron skillet. I'm sure after we get done we'll love it."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"The moistest, most flavorful cake I have ever eaten. I love Tortuga Rum Cakes, especially the Banana"
4,Cute little house,"This little birdhouse is very well made and a good value, the only drawback for me was that I had expected a larger house, but no matter some little bird will claim it for its own."
5,Great construction.,"The price is right. Cleaning is easy. A safe, warm winter shelter is needed now for my wild birds. In the summer, I'm sure the houses will be very busy. I am going to order two more, so there are no battles."
5,Perfect,"Attractive, well built, bird house--with wide enough opening, long-lasting material, and roof opens for cleaning. It's durable enough to hang in the cold winter months. Shipped within 3 days. Comes with round wire cable as shown in photo."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"Product didn't work. Because I bought it as a present and held it over 30 days, can't send it back to Amazon. Koolatron customer service wants me to trouble shoot and replace circuit board. They also misplaced the email I sent asking for new part. Recommendation: Don't ever buy from Koolatron or Amazon!"
2,Great Disappointment,"After surveying many books to purchase in preparation for college, I bought this book. I would not recommend this book for the following reasons: continuous sarcasm creates constant confusion, regular sexual innuendos get old fast, irrelevant page-fillers line book, but leave for an empty mind, and grammar and writing are much lower quality than expected of a Harvard graduate. The only suggestions, which I actually thought were helpful and relevant, of which there were some, were all too obvious and things I learned my freshman year in high school. Overall, I would not suggest a student, or anyone, buy this book, I regret that I did."
3,Okay Read,"I was glad to have read the book as to know what is expected to happen when staying on campus. However, it's only for freshman. What about students that are transferring from another institution, say, a community college? I did find some information useful when I was going through the process of enrolling in a four-year university and going to orientation. However, there are some things that I really didn't get into reading because I already was aware of that. Apart from that, the book is a pretty good read for anyone who is considering going back to school and staying on campus."
3,Four years is NOT very long!!!!,"It has been MANY years since I finished my BSEE degree. It was not at all easy. It should NOT be easy, because you want that degree to show that you deserve some level of respect.You can always 'party' when you finish school. If you go in thinking it is one big party, you will fail!!! Most people in the hard areas such any engineering or science areas had better be serious because FEW get out in four years.Also do not worry about failing a quiz or test once in a great while. Failure is a wonderful teacher! If it happens often find a new line of study or try much harder.If you are looking for a girl friend or boy friend then you are partially doomed. Unless, you meet somebody in the same field of study who knows when to be serious about school work!!!If you are taking a field of study JUST to please someone, then STOP IMMEDIATELY! This is a life altering experience, be smart about it!"
3,ok but has bad facts,"This was a good fill in the blanks book. But I do wish that the writers that they get for this series would at least read the books previous to it. Where did the sentence about Christine being involved with a new horse 'Mistic Blue' come from. if they had just read the previous book they would not have put this sentence in. As in the other books written by authors besides Joanne, the facts do not hold together to the previous books."
5,the hobo philosopher,"I hate reading this guy but I feel that it is my obligation. Mr. Chomsky has to be about as far left as left can go. But he is so well informed and so persuasive. He has got all the political arguments that most of us don't even want to consider. But you can't read Mr. Chomsky without opening up your mind. If you have a closed mind you won't be able to read him at all. In a debate Alan Dersherwitz accused Mr. Chomsky of being from outer space where he resided on the planet ""Chomsky."" And Dersherwitz who lives himself outside the Milky Way on the planet ""Dersherwitz"" should know an alien when he sees one.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:Mien Kampf - An Analysis of Book One"
2,Breaks down after a few uses,"This foam breaks down with use, so you'll only get a few uses out of them. I think I used them four times before throwing them out.On the other hand, I think I only paid about $6 for them. So on average, that's $1.25 per use. Not a completely unreasonable price to pay to protect your knees."
3,Overal decent knife,"This Henckels is a big upgrade if you have been cooking with the likes of Ikea's finest, then you will love this knife. It feels fairly solid and the initial sharpness is acceptable. I really like the weight of this knife. You can feel that there is a lot of steel at your disposal and the handle is comfortable. That being said, I have since purchased Wusthof Grand Prix II knifes. You can tell that they are in completely different leagues. I am keeping this knife as a backup knife in the event that I need one in the future as it is fairly sharp but does not hold its edge as well as a higher end knife. All this being said, this is a great knife to bridge someone from a cheap set of knives into premium ones. The difference between this and the kives I had been using prior to the Wusthof's is amazing. It has motivated me to cook more in the past month or so."
3,a moving story,"i thought this book was amazingly moving. it portrays a prostitutes life. her drug, law, and family problems all in one. i think the reason i liked it so much is because it was so real.even though it is a fiction book, there are really people out there with the same problems."
1,A slang dictionary must be updatable.,"This is just a way for Urban Dictionary to milk what their site stands for. If you want to keep up with slang, an offline dictionary is not the way to go. New slang is created and added every day on urbandictionary.com; most of it varies in importance, origin, use and documentation. All together, this is not an appropriate dictionary. Don't waste your money."
2,A poor rendition,Basically missing all the best [read: rude and offensive] bits of the website. Buy it if you wanna support them and have something to rest your mug on. I've read it cover to cover and it was nowhere near as good as the website.
2,check out the on-line version for a more thourough lexican,"You should already know most of the words in this book, but if you feel somebody you know is culturally illiterate and might benefit from these well know words send them one. I recommend the on-line version for some top notch entertainment."
5,A must have in any Paul Simon collection,"Wherein we get as close to knowing the real Paul Simon as we're ever gonna get. An underrated masterpiece of honesty, wisdom, song craft and art. If you wanna write a song about the moon - think of Mr. Simon before you start.The re-mastered version is a marked improvement in sound over the original cd release."
4,"All great, with one exception","I first purchased this album when I was 15 years old and visiting France. I had just started playing acoustic guitar and learning all things Paul Simon but had no idea this album existed. It was all I listened to for the rest of my stay. Nearly 20 years later, I still love every song on this album...Except for ""Cars Are Cars"" which I hereby state is the absolute worst Paul Simon song you will ever hear. Otherwise, this album is almost perfect. One of the most underrated -- and therefore most unheard of -- songs Simon ever wrote, ""Song About The Moon"", pops into my head more often than I care to admit. Originally, this was to be the Simon and Garfunkel reunion album, but at the last minute, Simon decided to remove Garfunkel and release it as a solo album. Does anyone know if the tapes still exist of Garfunkel singing on any of these songs?"
3,"Although Not A Commercial Success, Still A Great Album","I like this album of Paul's even if it wasn't a successful seller. I just wish that certain songs on this album didn't have anything to do with his relationship with his then-girlfriend-then-wife, [Carrie Fisher].The songs that I like are ""Allergies"", ""When Numbers Get Serious"", the (""b"") version of ""Think Too Much"", and ""Song About The Moon"". All the other songs were great too. Even though the sales were so low, this album was still worth getting. Almost all recording artists wind up having an unsuccessful album once in a while. Even when that happened to Paul, he bounced right back up. He's still good at what he does."
3,Pre-Star John Anderson album,"BUYERS PLEASE NOTE:This item now goes by 4 different titles, Backtracks, Mississippi Rainstorm, Somehow Someway Someday, and Country Comfort. All 4 have different release dates and different labels. Country Comfort is missing track 11 Bad Morning for Leaving but otherwise the track list on the 4 albums are identical.In my opinion, Backtracks is the best recorded of the 4 albums and this is the worst recorded of them. Backtracks showcases the pre-star voice of John Anderson very well."
4,shoes to get married in,Any Fluevog shoes are worth it. My new husband and I decided to both wear his styles to get married in. Fabulous!
2,A mediocore case by Sony,"The two things that I don't like about this case are: 1) it is a bit loose for the camera. In the excess space, you could put a spare memory stick or battery but those have no pockets and would occasionally rub against the camera. 2) When you try to place the camera in or out, you may find yourself pressing the power button which might damage your lenses."
2,Awkward case,"The quality of construction is pretty good and this does fit my H9 camera. It is easy to attach the camera to the case, but storing it (by folding the camera into place, is very awkward. I think a more conventional case would serve the H7/H9 better"
1,Too complicated,"The case looks nice, but when you try to use it is too tricky.Sometimes I needed a ""helper"" to put on the case to my camera."
1,Not the camera case I thought it was,"I purchased this item thinking that it was just like a regular camera case but in leather. I had just bought the SONY DSC-H9 digital camera. I don't know if the term ""jacket"" made the difference but I could barely fit my camera in because there was so many different parts of the case to attach together. It's definitely not a sample case that you zip up! I wish I had taken pictures of the case before returning it to better explain what I mean... Sorry! :-)"
2,Nice product but not my cup of tea,"This is a nice case, good protection for the camera. I personally did not like it because of the way my camera fit into it. Some people may really like this though. thanks"
3,"Must have for college students, not for professionals","Hennessy and Patterson put heavy emphasis on conceptual understanding of how modern computer work and how the performance is measured by benchmarking technique. I think this book should be a good wrap for college student.The thing that is pitiful is the exercises behind each chapter which is astronomically much more difficult to grasp and to comprehend. They might be too wordy and not suitable for someone who just learn computer architecture.The 'virtual' DLX ISA, although functions as a simple architecture, should be carefully revised to support or channel various issues in modern processor (like superscalar or VLIW). Students are stuck with DLX for the whole semester without the opportunity to explore other ISA like MIPS, VAX, or Intel x86."
1,disappointed,I am a computer engineering student who bought this book as a requirement for an advanced architecture course. I find this book cryptic at best. I find the text so general and abstract that it's impossible to read and the problems at the end of the chapters are so poorly worded that I would have been better off with no text at all.
4,the faning,i just love this book because it has so much detale.the chaters have soooo much feachers and detale to them eshpoley rothe rose because every day she wares the same cloer
1,A to Z mysteries bald bandit,"I loved this book because it's interesting,& the best part is when the bank robber got arrested.I love this book!!!"
5,best book,"Dink,Josh and Ruth rose were trying to find a red head with the video of a bank robber robbing the bank. The best part is when they found out the detective was a bank robber. They were at Dink's house. The police of Green lawn police department caught the robber and put him in jail."
5,A Book Review by Jenny C.,"I read a book called The Bald Bandit by Ron Roy. It's about a bandit who robs the Green Lawn Savings Bank. The three detectives (Dink, Josh, Ruth Rose) solved the mystery. When a private detective named Reddy came to look for the videotape the three detectives decided to help him. Reddy said if they found the videotape they would earn a hundred bucks.My favorite part of the book was when Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose got the videotape and they watched the tape and they noticed it was Reddy who robbed the bank. When Reddy was at Dink's house ready to get the video, Dink hid it and gave him a tape of soccer. Ruth Rose sneaks into her house and calls the police. I think the thief was pretty smart.I think the book was a perfect fit for me because I love reading mystery books. When I read this book at home I can't stop reading it until I finish."
4,The Amazing book,"This is a story about three kids named Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose who try to find a kid who has taped the robber on camera stealing $ from the bank. It's a very adventurous story. My favorite character is Josh because he always eats food every fifteen minutes.I loved the book so much, my favorite part in the book is when Ruth Rose was Elvis for Halloween.I recommend this book because its, fun, adventurous, and exiting. This book is part of the Atoz series."
5,The Bald Bandit,Having trouble getting your 3-5 grader to read? These books are the answer. Simple plot lines with enough long words to challenge your elementary student.
4,Good for first graders,"""A little scary. Adventurous."" Those are the words my six year old used to describe the book. Looking forward to the next book."
2,overrated,"it's a fun game but it takes too long in loading. You can never escape computer cheating, coming back in the final seconds, and playing defense is a trained art. Don't think it's worth the price, get NBA 2K"
4,"Not quite ""NBA Jam"" on Xbox but the best you can get on Dreamcast","After playing NBA Jam on my friends Xbox I really wanted to get a similar game for the used Sega Dreamcast I had bought for $20. This game is no NBA Jam but it's as close as your going to get for the Dreamcast. If your not comparing it with any other basketball titles then you're definitely going to love this game. Like most basketball games though, this is not exactly realistic since you can pull off all kinds of crazy moves the real NBA stars could only dream of. The controls are easy to get the hang of and the game has most of the features you would expect from a game like this.Conclusion: If your looking for a basketball game for your Dreamcast then this is what you were looking for!"
3,mediocre,"Showtime is a good game with all the pushing and roughhousing and all the mayhem.What i am trying to say is any basketball fan who whants to play basketball games where its played the rightway do not buy showtime.Here are some examples for instance,you can pretty much punch the living pulp out of the player to steal the ball and the dunks are unrealistic and last but not least everybody shoots way over averege in the game.So anybody who loves basketball with no rules get this game the only problem is that the options get old real fast."
3,"NBA Jam it aint, But still fun.","Overall NBA Showtime is a pretty nice game. But I guess the NBA Jam formula has just gotten old because I remember Jam on Genesis being more fun. If you have never played Jam this may be great spectactular fun with lots of cool options. Again, this overall is a pretty cool game, not the best but still alright. Midway has now succsesfully created good x-treme football and Basketball games so lets get workin on a baseball one."
1,[Price].....for this?!?!?!?!?,"I bought NBA Showtime with the purchase of my Dreamcast hoping for some real basketball. I was sure disappointed. After playing it twice I put it away for good. The game is stupid. NBA Showtime has the worst gameplay ever. The computer can jump 50 feet in the air to make a block then swish a full-court shot. The graphics are terrible. The players' muscles' are bigger than their heads and they look very unrealistic.This game blows! It's just like NFL QB Club except for basketball, an NBA 2KX wannabe!Do not buy this game. Midway sure know's how to [mess] games up!"
1,Worst Game Ever!,"After buying my Dreamcast used with alot of games, I just noticed that this is the last game I tried out, and the first game that I put away. The gameplay is the shallowest ever. I didn't play (or look at) this game since I tried it for the first time. The graphics are extremely bad. The players look very unrealistic. The colors in this game are very bad and dark. the entire game looks like an N64 game.That's about all I have to say about this NBA 2K1 WANNABE GAME!!!I hope that this review was helpful to you."
2,"Been there, done that!","Hey, I played this game 5 years ago and it was called NBA jam. Skip this game, get NBA 2K. There is no reason to buy this game. Good graphics, though."
3,good but not compared to NBA2K,a decent game especially if you liked NBA JAM and HANGTIME but considering the fact that an in depth and extremely fun game called NBA2K is on the dreamcast this game only gets 3 stars compared to the 5 i give nba2k
1,Please read this,"This game is worst game I have ever bought in my whole life. We don't have access to change the views. It doesn't show replays. The graphics are the worst of all, because the back ground people don't move. Please don't buy this game, I rather recommend you buying NBA live 2000 or NBA courside2. Thank you."
4,nothing really.,"cmon write some reviews this games still good isn't it? hasn't been a review in like 2-3 months! I bought the game a week ago, because partly I didn't like spending all my quarters in a arcade machine, I mean it was fun in the arcade but can get a little costy after a while.Later, Bob Baller (don't really care if u find this review not helpful its not meant to be, just to give information.)"
3,NBA- too much showtime,"I'm a big fan of the NBA Jam series of games, which this is a part of. However, the big difference between this game and the others in the series is that defense is nearly impossible. If either team wants to dunk, its going to happen. Even if you block a shot, the other team will likely get the rebound and dunk it anyway. Passing is so quick, that the other team can make 5 passes in 2 seconds for an easy dunk. This is the case against the computer or other players. It's just not much fun when offense is so easy and hard to stop."
5,awesome episodes,this is the fourth disc to season 2 part 2. this disc contains the first couple episodes from season 3. this is an awesome collection of episodes. if you have not seen season thre then i recommend you do
5,Good buy,I got this for my son for his birthay. It keeps him busy on long trips. I love the fact that it has the option to turn the sound off!!!

1,nooo,"that was too dam expensive, and after a while it stopped working. i would never order another one of those things again. i just thew it away"
5,Great writing and photos,This is a great book to promote writing and photojournalism with children. The pictures and writing make you feel like you are exploring with them!
4,His back was to me,"Very enjoyable movie. Lou is one of the best at his craft. The is a great for the family if you and yours like westerns. Great lines in the movie. ""So where do you want to get shot, the stomach or the head?"" ""Oh, how about in France in the Spring"". Try it, you will like it..."
5,El Diablo,"I purchased this DVD to add to our home collection, as my family have enjoyed it before having rented it twice before. Several of the family liked the humorous vein of the story, while others just enjoyed it for a new western."
4,A good comedy Western,"This movie should not be viewed with the idea of a serious western. I did, but it didn't take but about 5 minutes to see this was a comedy with a western flavor. Others have given the general story of the movie so I will comment on the actors. I thought they all preformed well and made it a fun watch for the evening without taxing my brain. This was from a VHS tape and was very good color wise and clear viewing. I would recomend this for a fun evening. A little gory and some swearing so parents check it out before letting young children watch."
4,El Diablo,El diablo is a funny western about a young school teacher who decides to rescue one of his students kidnapped by a natorious bad man. Knowing nothing of gun play he teams up with an old gunfighter who tries to teach him the skillful art before rescuing the girl. The adventures they have while chasing the gang down and teaching lessons is funny and entertaining. It is well worth the time.
1,el diablo,It only plays half way through you are selling junk that does not evan work its useless.I dont want my money back i want a dvd of el diablio that does not skip or stop i want to watch the movie all the way through dont e mail me or text me send me a dvd or double my money for all the trouble
4,Sammy's still out there,"From North Carolina to you, Phil Ochs' protege proves his worth again by marrying tradition and topical in a quiet civil ceremony. Walker plays instruments he builds himself, and this recording has the nice informal feel of a good home recording. It would be great to see him at the Woody Guthrie festival in Okemah Oklahoma, because he would be the star attraction."
4,Good Gun,"This gun is good with an average range. the bullets fall quick so get light bb's. its a good gun all in allPros:LightSturdyRIS system lets you attatch things to all 4 sides of gripGood for beginnersAccurateCons:bb's fallRange is averageBattery life is okDelay in shooting (after you pull the trigger, it takes about 1/2 a second to shoot gets kinda annoying)Loud"
5,cheap gun but good quality,This an all around great gun for the priceMy kids love it so farand it doesn't brake the bank to let them have fun
1,Junk,DO NOT BUY this is terrable the clip broke within the hour the barrel fell out and the battery over heats dont buy for your own good and there is no refund don waste your money
4,Good,Only problem with product was directions were NOT in English and no English instructions could not be found in box. :(
3,ok for the price,Good weapon realy fast but not to accuratate. I hate the fact the big battery lays on the top like that..It is not durable the stock broke the first week. The magazine could only hold like 20 bbs. Also it came with a light it didnt even go on right. You also must have a secondary.
1,Terrible Gun!,"This gun is bad. The first day I got this gun the magazine broke! This gun is plastic and kind of flimsy. If you want something durable than buy a metal gun. Also it is very loud when you shoot it, so if you have picky neighbors than don't shoot it often."
4,Superb jazz guitar,"A beautiful and musically varied solo acoustic approach to jazz guitar. The style veers a bit more formal than swinging or bluesy, but the musicianship is impeccable--a very listenable and rewarding album, especially for those who love guitar virtuosity."
4,Very fine playing by a master,"The number of solo jazz guitarists is slowly increasing since Joe Pass's seminal 1973 disc ""Virtuoso!"" Gene Bertoncini is certainly on anyone's short list of masterful players, or should be. The material here is not as familiar as might be heard on some of his other CDs, but the quality of performance is magnificent."
5,"I've been there, I know, and the book captures it!","I was born in NE, lived there, then in other remote ranching areas. The people, times, and conditions that are masterfully described in this book are what it is all about. I doubt that those who have lived their lives in cities, on lots, among throngs of people, and within the mainstream of the American culture, can fully realize the truth and character of this story and work. I probably see these people and events through a different window than the author, but she has captured their essence. Read it and live the special life of those who look across rolling hills of nothingness and see everything!"
5,best quality with reasonable price!,"There are many pockets and partitions that I need.This bag is compact, light, but you can bring as many as items you have.I have Canon Xsi with three lenses, it is perfect for me.I believe this bag is good for the bigger cameras, such as 5D and 1Ds as well."
2,Have it less than a month and already a rip!,"I purchased this because of the great reviews on Amazon. I also checked it out at Best Buy prior to my online purchase and the bag looked decent and sturdy. After the first week of usage, I was disappointed. I have a Canon 40D and a 18-35mm lens. I purchased this camera recently and have not purchase any other accessories. When I put my 40D into the Canon bag, the camera moves around too much and the supportive padding is not sturdy to hold the camera in place. Also, there is no support strap inside the bag to lock down the camera. I think the bag should have some type of supportive strap to keep the camera from moving. After one month of usage, I discovered a 4"" rip on a seam in the upper right region of the bag.Pros:Looks nice and large storage capacity.Cons:Poor quality. Poor storage support.Amazon:Retail price at Best Buy store in City of Industry, CA is $80 and retail price at amazon.com is $42.00; a saving of nearly 50%."
5,Canon Backpack,"Excellent backpack. Lots of space inside, highly resistant velcro separations for re-organizing your equipment, plus it is nicely made and feels like it will last for a long time.I've had mine for almost 1 year and don't have any complains. Highly recommended."
4,"Great Light Duty Bag ""You get what you pay for""","I've read all of the reviews, good and bad. Made note of the cheap zippers used in the construction. Purchased it anyway due to the very low price. Here's my take: its a pretty good bag for the price, ""you do get what you pay for"". This is a light duty bag geared towards Rebel and EF-S lens owners. I dont recommend it for the heavier 50D, 5D or 1D series. Although the 50D/5D with batt grip will fit, the measly padding offers little protection. My camera gear is constantly growing and I use this bag solely for storage of my 5DMKII at home. I purchased a more durable bag for carrying.I've given it 4 stars for Rebel + EF-S lens owners looking for a good economical bag. I dont recommend carrying any heavier semi-pro/pro gear with it. I also would recommend removing the Canon logo so people dont know what your carrying around."
5,Great Camera Bag!,This bag does it all. It carries so much more than other bags and the backpack style is ideal. The separate outer compartments are perfect for storing small essentials.
4,I love the Bag and great service.,"The bag is great. The quality is very nice. The bag has good storage. I fit my Canon XS a 250 mm lens, a canon point and HD Camcorder and all the chargers tapes batteries. I still have storage space. The bag is a little to big just to carry around for everyday stuff. I think it is a great vacation camera bag."
5,"quality, quantity, at a reasonable price","Well the Canon photo Backpack arrived today, earlier then predicted, and it was as advertised.I had also considered the Lowepro Trekker 200,and Tamrac expidition 3. The Canon in the final analysis had more interior usable space and more external options for carring stuff ( but not by a lot), it was also a few dollars cheaper. All three products offered similar camera/Lens protection levels, and flexable interior versatiality aka configuring storage space to meet your needs.If you can try on the different designs of the manufactors to see what floats your boat.I made my choice based on my planned trip to a few national parks in Utah and what I need to bring on my day hikes. Any one of the three back packs would have been fine the differences are minor,for example the Trekker 200 sits high on the shoulder and has a smaller footprint but we are talking maybe 3 inches in length,it still straps to your back and carries more lens then you should need."
2,ok for the money...,"Nothing really wrong with it given the price paid. Easy to modulate the interior, good capacity, light weight.Not very comfy when loaded with lots of things.Good value for money."
5,Great on-the-go camera pack,"I own a Canon EOS 7D with four lenses, Speedlite flash, lens covers, hoods, etc. This bag fits it all. There's extra area on the front for storage of documents (or, often times, my Kindle). Side pockets, interior zippers and sturdy/spacious dividers allow for all my accessories to go with me (including two batteries, charger, CF cards & card reader). As long as you're not slamming the bag around, this is a great option to keep all your camera & glass together."
5,Great Bag!,"I just received the Canon backpack camera bag and I am really happy with it. I am not a professional photographer...just have a Canon Rebel EOS camera with a couple of lenses and a small camcorder. Everything fits great with plenty of room to tuck in whatever else our family may need for a sporting event, school concert, etc. Very comfortable to wear - would be great for moms or dads who need their hands free to manage little ones. Love it!!!!"
5,Perfect camera bag!,"Love this bag, every thing fits . Soft compartments with Velcro to adjust the exact size you need. Was soooo pleased with this I gave away all my other camera bags!!!"
1,Garbage,if zero was a choice I would pick that. the bag unzips on its own and my camera and lens crashed to the ground.
5,Great backpack!,"This backpack has traveled with me to a lot of places and has proven very comfortable on my back and big enough for my Canon 20D, three zoom lenses with hoods, two flashes, a few filters and manuals, and a charger with extra battery.Don't try this at home, but I've been able to pack 11 (eleven) lenses, six of them telephoto, and a body into this backpack, and the zipper still closed without much effort."
2,"Inexpensive, CHEAP non-pro style backpack","I was swayed by all the good reviews and bought one, even though the older style Canon backpack I had bought and then promptly got rid of some years back had left a bad taste in my mouth. Well, let's just say things aren't much better. There are a number of improvements and the styling is nice. But a Rebel with battery grip doesn't fit. Therefore, I don't think a 10D or a 20D will either. Not sure about an XT since it is smaller. Assuming of course you have the add on battery grip like I do. The zippers absolutely stink. They are light duty and don't zip smoothly. I feel like the weight of the camera up high will force the zippers to slowly unzip and there goes the camera. I am so unimpressed. It's not even worth the cheap price Amazon is asking in my opinion. Spend some more money for a good bag like a Tamrac."
4,Awesome bag! Stores a lot of stuff!,"The bag is great! I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT 350D, battery grip, EF IS USM 28-135mm lens, Sigma DG Super Flash, and a number of filters and they all fit nicely into this bag!The padding is good and the dividers are good! Lots of other zipped pockets for storing charger and extra batteries! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the backpack straps feels awkward on my shoulders. I feel that the bag doesn't fit close to my back... this may be due to the heavy camera with the battery grip... but otherwise, excellent bag for its value!!! Highly recommended!"
5,Great looking bag!,"A mentor of mines once said that it's never a good idea to buy a bag that bares the same name as the contents inside of it (Canon bag with Canon camera inside of it), since it's a easy tip off for would be thieves. However with the great amount to ""thumbs up"" reviews of this bag and the overall design of it, I couldn't resist in purchasing one.I give this bag a TWO THUMBS UP because it's the right size. It's not too big or small either. The velcro dividers makes it easy to resize compartments, allowing you to fit a SLR camera and any size lens attached to it. The bag is also stylish and I wouldn't mind carrying it wherever I go. It's also a great value as it's a mid size bag that bares the Canon name. A recommended buy! :)"
5,beginner camera backpack,"I bought this product so I could manage my cameras and equipment while I fly out to photo destinations around the nation. The trip to San Diego, CA was my first trip using this bag. The cameras were easy to get out and the bag was not a burden on me while walking large airports like DFW. The bag stayed on me while hiking down some rather steep cliffs off the California coast and was easy to clean off when it got sand on it from the various beaches I went to. Coming back from San Diego I got stuck in DFW airport due to snow, I used the back of the bag as a pillow while sleeping in the airport overnight without damage what was in the bag. The bag does prove to get heavy from the weight of my cameras and their equipment, but doesn't leave a mark on my shoulders from the wide strapes. I would recommend this bag for a freelance photographer with a small business, it is perfect to begin holding all your cameras and film."
4,Great bag after slight modification,"I ordered this bag in January 2008 and have used it on several trips. It is a great bag because it holds my 4 lenses, xti camera body, speedlite and other accessories with room to spare. The padding on the straps make them very comfortable, and if you really need the stabilization, there is a small chest strap...nothing like a backpacking strap, but it does its job. The only complaint I had was the ""tripod strap"" on the bottom of the pack. The straps were not quick release snaps, but rather the kind you have to pull to loosen or tighten. I had a quick fix for this by going to walmart and getting the same width straps and some quick release buckles. About $5 and 2 minutes later, I had a pack that I was very happy with."
5,Backpack,"The backpack was just what my fiance needed. It is extremely easy to put the camera in the bag, and it also allows you to have your hands free when you need them the most. Not to mention if you are taking pictures you don't want to have a bag falling from your shoulder to your elbows right in the middle of the best shot you may ever take. It's awesome!"
4,Great bag for the money,"Very good bag for the money. I fit all my lenses meter and camera body in this bag with pleanty of room, tough it isn't a huge bag. There is a slightly misleading pic on here that shows a laptop in the bag. I can fit my powerbook G4 in the outside pocket BUT THIS IS NOT DESIGN SPECIFIC< NO PADDING > but it works :)"
2,Was not impressed,I don't know how this bag managed to get almost 900 positive reviews. I was shocked when I opened the box and saw the actual size of this bag. I have two bags now to carry my gear and was looking for something I could pack most of my equipment in for day trips. This bag is smaller than one of the bags I was replacing. My 5D Mark II with the 24-70 f/2.8 L lens attached takes 1/3 of the space of this bag alone. Also as others have noted either remember to zipper around to the bottom every time or safety pin one end of the zipper at the bottom to force you to remember or you'll have your equipment falling out if you zipper both to the top. Not a bad bag but just don't expect it to be nearly as large as it seems on Amazon.
2,"low price, low quality","As many users suggested here, this backpack is OK to use, but when you stuff pro gears like a Nikon D300 camera, a 17-55mm F2.8 and a 70-200mm F2.8 lens, and a SB800 flash, the bag is not strong enough to hold them tight - the major problem is the pads separating the rooms in the bag are a bit on the thin side, you just don't feel this product is sturdy and safe. But what can I say, cheapo is cheapo."
4,Canon Photo Backpack,"The bag is a good value for the price. I loaded it with three cameras, a Canon Rebel, a Canon 5D, a Canon G11 and four lenses. It all fits but is heavy and it is difficult to reach the equipment as the bag has to be removed and placed on the ground. I am planning a trip to Russia and the Baltic countries. The name Canon is prominent on the front of the pack. I have been advised to remove it for security reasons. That will not be easy without damaging the bag. I probably will transfer what I need to a vest each morning and leave the bag in a secure place."
4,Set it up however works best for you,"I'm always amazed at how much equipment I can fit into this bag. It gets too heavy to be comfortable before I run out of room. I've set it up multiple ways for different gigs, and it's proved very handy. I guess the only real downside is that with so many compartments, sometimes it's hard to remember if I put my filters in the side pockets, the interior mesh pocket, or the back area. A good problem to have, I suppose."
4,Canon backpack,I use this for my Nikon camera. Because its good and its not expensive. Does everything I need it to. I wish that there was more padding on the front of the pack. I feel like its not well protected on the flap.
5,Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack,"excellent item...very well planned out. Holds a lot of things! Lots of compartments / space, etc. Well made - durable and nice color."
2,Tearing apart in just 2 trips,"I had this bag for two months now, although it has enough space to store the SLR and 3 lens, its not long lasting - just good enough for 8-10 weeks or max 2-3 trips. I had carried my camera in this bag for two 1 day trips only; during my second trip i noticed that the outer zipper cover of the main compartment is tearing apart, that scared me, could have cost me my camera ... does not seem safe for a $1000 camera, have returned the bag and awaiting the refund. Have attached some pictures."
1,Bad Customer service,"Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras (Black with Green Accent)DO not buy this Bag. Run away as fast as you can. It has the Canon name but they do not support this product. After having this bag for four months the stitching began to come apart on the outside and inside. Call up Canon and they told me I was out of luck after 30 days. There are better bags on the market for a little more so , don't support this product.Un happy camper"
2,Poorly Made,"I had this backpack and found that after a year of sporadic use the zippers were tearing from the main compartment and the liner on the inside was peeling off. If you are getting serious about photography this is a starter pack only.I recently replaced this with one from Thinktank that is 3x more expensive, but it quality that should last a lot longer than one year.You get what you pay for and this is the cheapest camera backpack out there.I do not recommend this unless you only have $50 to spend."
2,"Looks great, not functional","The looks of this bag are great, but the inside is not as functional as I'd like. The Velcro strips will NOT adhered to the sides and are always coming unstuck leaving my equipment in disarray. I should have went with another type or brand. I am very disappointed in the quality."
4,Great bag for the money,"This bag, although not perfect, is really a bargain. It is avery large, well built bag. I have been wanting a good camera bag for a couple of years, but did not want to pay $100+ for one of those LowePro bags. It goes without saying that the LowePro bags are more sturdy, and I believe they are the better bags. However, I highly recommend this bag for those, like me, on a budget. I love mine!"
4,Tight squeeze for my Canon 7D with Vertical Grip,Overall satisfied with this bag. Not quite as large as i had imagined. The slot that is designed for a camera mounted with large telephoto lens will barely hold my Canon 7D with vertical grip and 70-200. I have to tug and push to get the zipper to close. This bag would definetly not work for someone with a tall camera like a 1D series. This is why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I almost gave it 3 stars. Canon should have noticed this before putting it into production.
1,Seams are poppin!!!,I purchased this backpack approx. 6 months ago. I have used it about 3 times a week. The form and fuctionality of the item is fine. The quality of the construction is poor. The seams are beginning to pop at multiple points. If you are looking for a backpack for even moderate use I would look to a different brand. I am suprised that Canon put its good brand on this item. I have owned many Canon items through the last 30 years and have always been satisfied. I am having doubts about the brands quality.
4,great backpack,"I was really pleased with my Canon backpack. When I bought my camera last year I priced camera cases,either they were really expensive or too small. This backpack hold my camera lenses and my digital video cam and has plenty of pockets for all the other things you might need on a pictures taking trip. The price was great too. This is my first SLR camera and now I have the perfect storage. Iam planning a trip across the United States next summer and I'm all set with this backpack."
4,Bigger than I expected...,"This backpack was a bit bigger than I expected, but just what I needed with several lenses and cameras. There was plenty room for my DSLR, 70-200, and several other lenses. There is also room for my tripod on the back which leaves by hands free. I would recommend this backpack and will probably purchase another one. The amazon price was half as in the local store."
5,Solid and Dependable,"I'm not a professional photographer but I do have a tendency to lug all my equipment around with me. This backpack case is wonderful. I've found it to be comfortable when wearing it, and getting to my various lenses and filters is easy. The color hides the dirt I invaribly get when I toss it to the ground. If I travel I will be putting a small lock on the clamshell zippers to keep the tempted from trying to see what is inside, so outside of having the whole case stolen, I feel this pack is a low-priced, great camera security system with ease of use and convenience."
4,Great for Travel,"Great for Travel , excellent if you need to go out or just keep your stuff in orderin a sesion."
3,Started falling apart quickly,"For the price, this is an ok bag. It holds quite a bit, and has a lot of compartments. However...1. If you have a 70-200mm lens, and use a lens hood, it will fit, but it's going to be a really tight squeeze.2. I quickly outgrew this bag. I have a Canon 5D Mark II, a 70-200mm lens, a 85mm, a 24-105mm, a 50mm, and a couple of 430EX Speedlites. Trying to get all of that to fit is a pretty tight squeeze.3. One of the zipper handles broke to an outside compartment within a week.4. The material used is thin, and the zippers are cheap. As a result, if you leave the zipper even a little bit unzipped on the main compartment, the weight of your gear will cause the entire bag to unzip and dump your stuff out.This is a good bag if you have a camera and maybe 1 or 2 lenses. But, if you have expensive gear, I'd invest in a more expensive, well-made bag."
5,Great Purchase,This product showed on in a timely manner and was in great shape. I have loved using it and am very glad I purchased from this buyer. Great experience!
4,Canon 200 EG photo backpack,"This backpack is a great value for the price. Has interchangeable velcro padding to accomodate different sizes, will hold several lenses, flash,and camera body. It is lightweight, but padding could be more substantial. Good use for outdoors photo shoots. Would recommend to others."
5,Rocking Backpack,This backpack is a great way to put all your lens and camera. I am yet to have enough items to fill up the empty spaces but I know when I get more equipment than I am surely in no position to worry not having any room to fit them. I even can fit my laptop. It's great! I recommend travelers to purchase this backpack. It's great looking too! I wouldn't mind using this for school.
5,"Absolutely best camera bag, plenty of room for extra lens!!!","Great camera bag! Lots of room for all my lens, flash,etc. Sturdy, water resistant, and lots of padding inside to protect your valuable cameras! Enough room that I can leave my smaller lens on one Canon, and longer lens on other Canon, and have plenty of room still. I like the two side velcro pockets also, so that you can throw your keys in or extra money so you don't have to carry your purse also! Great bag overall, just what I wanted!!!"
5,Great for Olympus evolt e500 kit,"Awesome size. Can carry 3 lens, ancillary stuff, books, 1 kit & tripod. Big zise - decent padding. Happy with purchase."
5,No complaints,"I bought pack as a gift. The recipient loves it...very useful, plenty of room, comfortable and light weight. Just what they wanted."
5,Great Bag,"So far this bag has been great, I think it was a great deal. I pack it every where I go, and it seems to be very durable. I have taken one long trip with the bag, From the US to Israel, stopped in London and Amsterdam as well. Still holding up well, and I had it packed tight. I give it an A++!!Note: Please excuse spelling"
4,Straps,"I got this bag because it fits everything I need and I thought it would be a good beginning photographer bag. So far it has worked out well but not as well as I would have liked.It holds a lot of gear but the strap design and the way the zippers work doesn't seem completely functional. I guess you get what you pay for with this bag.To elaborate...The shoulder straps are sown in at the top right next to each other with no gap between them. If you have wide shoulders, you might want to try it on before purchasing. For me I have to make it sit really low on my back in order for it to be slightly comfortable and I like my packs to sit up high.The zipper isn't very solid and it seems weak. It is hard to zip up half the time and the other half of the time the weather proof flap gets in the way. As I said it isn't entirely functional.If you can get past these two issues then this bag is a great buy for the money."
1,Canon Camera Backpack,"I used this backpack to carry a camera and two lense around Europe. The pack has plenty of room for the camera and accessories plus an addtional pocket big enough to carry magazines. Also, it has a mesh pocket and traps for tripods. It is an excellent value for the price. Other similar sized packs cost in the range of $80 to $100. Delivery was quick too...one week."
4,Well worth it.,"Probably not quite the equal to my Lowepro model of similar size, but quite impressive nontheless. I purchased this for my wife, hoping to save a little money (don't tell her). Very sturdy, with added pockets I'd have to pay extra for elsewhere. The interior padding is especially sturdy. Don't know yet how useful the tripod straps will be, but they are also well secured. Padding and strapping seem adequate."
4,"So far, so good","So far, this bag is exactly what I expected. It is very stiff and not overly comfortable, but is has not been used much so far. I am hoping it softens up a bit and will not feel so rigid in the straps. This will be a good day pack for my family and has plenty of room for our gear. I have not had any problems with lenses moving around or anything being loose in the bag. As I get more gear for my camera I will probably upgrade to something nicer, but for now this bag is perfect!"
5,great,Great bag just waiting for the camera to put in. The only other thing I will do to the bag is add more straps .
5,Best Camera Bag,This has to be the best camera bag out there (that we could afford anyway) very good product for the money! Do not go spend $100 on another bag. This will hold everything you need plus some! I love it!
4,Satisfied.,"I am satisfied with this back pack. construction is good, not the best I've seen.. I got this item for one purpose. I'm not in the states at this time, so when I ordered a D700, with a 50mm 1.8, 70-200mm 2.8, and 24-70mm 2.8 and a grip... some filters etc, I needed something for my friend to carry it in on his flight! That's all!I thought it wouldn't be a good as my other bags but I was surprised! Now I use it regularly. Its a Canon branded backpack, on the outside and even on the inside lining yet I got all Nikon gear? Well I have canon gear as well.!!My main gripe, It could have been 3-6 inches taller, seeing that i want to use it so much."
4,Excellent,"Fits lots of lenses with ease and has good padding. gave it a 4 because of the tripod mount, it's still good but could have been better..."
2,Bag is Fine - Zipper a Bit Flaky,"I've had this bag for a month and have noticed the zipper is separating at times. I've taken to having the zippers both on one end to be sure the zipper does not open up while on my back, dumping my Sigma 70-200 F2.8 lens on the ground. Not good.If I could return it today I would as a future zipper episode haunts me."
3,ok bag...for a while,"I have used this bag on and off for a about a year now and it had been a good bag overall until about a few of months ago when the zipper tabs started falling off. By now the bag is very difficult to use because most all of the tabs have fallen off and it is very hard to zip the compartments open and shut. For the price it is a ok bag, but if you are going to use it a lot and want a long lasting bag I would suggest a more expensive Lowepro or Temrac bag. As with everything, you get what you pay for."
1,I dropped my Canon 60D from this backpack,"I was walking fast pace to the airport terminal. The zippers were coming loose slowly from the weight of this camera and eventually the backpack was wide open.This backpack should have some type of buckle snaps on each two sides.I'm very unhappy right now, dropping my Canon 60D that I just bought. It has some cracks but still working good."
5,Perfect Camera Bag,"Love this carrying case. It holds all my lenses, and of course my camera, and even has room for my mini camcorder. I would definitely recommend this to any amateur/hobbyist photographer."
3,Canon back pack camera bag,"Canon 200EG Deluxe Back Pack + Deluxe Photo/Video 57"" TripodVery fine bag but to small for my use, I will only use on limited small shoots. I will buy MUCH larger version. Canon 5D II with 70-200mm f2.8L too big to fit with battery grip installed."
5,Canon Backpack 200EG,Perfect pack for a couple of lenses and a couple of flash units. The interior is very easy to reconfigure the pocketing. Shoulder straps are multiple adjusting and well padded. I LIKE.
3,padding is thinner than I expected,"I have a Lowepro - Mini Trekker. I am pretty satisfied with it. When I bought my Canon 70-200mm f2.8 IS. I outgrew with my Lowepro - Mini Trekker. Logically, I looked for bigger size of bag from Lowepro. However, based on the Amazon reviews, this Canon 200EG bag has more reviews and better rating. The price is much more attractive too. However, when the bag has arrived, the padding of the bag was much thinner than I was expected. So I returned this bag and ordered a Lowepro CompuTrekker AW instead."
5,Great Camera Bag,"I really like this camera bag. It holds my camera, six lenses, external light, digital camera, movie camera, all the accessories imaginable, plus my tripod can be strapped on the outside. I can also stick a water bottle in the side pocket. The only draw back would be the weight of the pack after it's totally load. Most of the time I have only one strap thrown over a shoulder, but if I'm hiking I will use both straps to distribute the weight evenly. I would buy it again."
4,Good item if only...,"Enough to hold a SLR, 4 lens and flash plus all the nick nacks in the zippered sections. Straps are strong, but zippers don't hold to firm, had to tie it together when travelling and walking around. but great product still."
3,This is an Okay Bag...,This bag is okay - I used it for shooting weddings for a few months before purchasing a new bag. It's a little smaller than I'd like - I really need something with more space for more lenses... This being said - if I were on vacation and taking one camera and two lenses instead of two cameras with several - then this is an excellent bag.
3,Solid,"Great bag that has detachable compartments to put your gear in. I love the zips and front pocket has great storage for smaller items like memory cards, batteries and more. The one down side, the zipper broke quickly =("
5,Camera case.,"I love my case. I hold three lenses my camera, video camera and additional flash with plenty of room and easy to get at. Also has plenty of additional storage for other small items."
5,I was lucky,I had been searching for something like this and really felt lucky it was advertised by Amazon coincidently.
4,Very good bag at a great price,Tons of storage space in this bag. A bit bulky when you put it on your back but pretty comfortable to wear.
4,Very satisfied,"I read the reviews for this bag, and the bad ones complained that it was too small, or that it fell apart after a week. Well, it has not fallen apart after a month, although I do take good care of it. Is it too small? Listen, camera bags are expensive, so if you pay around $30 for a camera bag and it can hold multiple lenses and two SLRs on your back, you should be happy. The bag is smallish, but not at all tiny, and I would say that the bag is for a hobbyist and not a professional. I can even put my tripod (which is in a bag) in the front part of the bag. I personally think that this bag is the best bag you can get for the money and it will make your picture taking experience so much easier."
3,Leaves something to be desired,"I purchased this backpack thinking that it would be well-designed with a photographer's needs in mind. I've found it difficult to use for walking around and shooting, because the pack is not made to be accessible. What I'm mainly disappointed about is that when you want to open it, you basically have to set it down and use both hands to open it up and get out your camera. If you try to sling it around to your front and zip it open with one hand, the zippers are so easy to open that the whole bag falls open and your gear dumps out. You can't open it one-handed or standing up. This is a serious problem if you want to be on your feet moving around and have quick access to your camera.Other than this issue, it's a decent bag with plenty of space, but the accessibility is such a big problem that I almost returned it. I expected more of Canon."
3,A little disappointed,"I just bought a Canon SLR and needed a little day pack to carry the camera and all the essentials. I do like all the compartments, it makes it easier to be organized. The first time I used it for a trip the zipper handle broke. I was at the airport and was in a rush to get my wallet into the pack. I must have pulled it the wrong way and the handle that pulls the zipper broke."
4,Good one,After buying this product i was happy. Good amount of space in it.The canon label on top of the bag went off. But apart from that all was fine. THough i have not ever taken it in the rain. But drizzles are fine for this bag.
4,Great Camera Bag,This bag is wonderful for my Canon 7D and lenses and accessories. It has plenty of room and lots of padding to protect your equipment. The straps on the side come in handy for carrying your tripod or straping your jacket to your bag if you get hot while shooting pics. The only complaint I have at all is that the top of the straps seem to be a bit too close together. Perhaps as I wear it more they will soften up an little and won't feel like they're pinching my shoulders. Overall a good bag and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a good backpack for their Canon.
4,High quality backpack but be careful. . .,"This is a quality-built bag for it's price-point. 'Nothing cheap about it. You just need to be cautious about advertising to others what's in the bag, i.e. 'Canon' is right out there for everyone to see. . . .and to advertise that there is likely some high-end camera gear inside. While Canon products are worth advertising it's wise to keep the bag close to you.My only serious concern is with regard to the bag's pocket-fit for my lenses. They can very easily fall out and there's no good way to make them more secure in the bag except to be very careful. . . .as opposed to the LowPro Flipside 300 series bags which are configured a little differently and can be made more secure. They're a whole different animal though.The Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack is a really nice bag and highly recommended."
4,Great pack,This seems to be a good pack for the money and holds a DSLR and all sorts of lenses and equipment.
3,Excellent DSLR backpack,"Backpack is excellent for all your equipment. Very comfortable. Compartments can easily be changed for your convenience. Could not fit my 13"" laptop in the outer compartment."
4,"Decent backpack, reasonably priced","Excellent response by vendor, Adorama - shipped right away and had it in hand in 48 hours.Product is advertised as being able to hold a camera with battery pack attached... yeah, kind of, but you have to squeeze it in. As with other reviewers, I would have appreciated a few more straps. You must have a place to lay this pack down to access your materials. Don't even think of trying to stand it on its end. All that being said, it is sturdy, comfortable and well designed. You can get a good bit of stuff into it including a couple of lenses.Very well designed for a day trip of photography climbing up the hill to get pictures of autumn in Vermont... exactly why I bought it and exactly what I intend to do very shortly.Worth the money..."
5,great,Thanks to the great pictures that were provided for this product we got exactly what we wanted from this camera backpack. The item was shipped promptly and the order was accurate. The backpack offers an adequate amount of space for equipment and seems to be pretty sturdy so far.
4,Good but not great,"A good camera bag if you are traveling. My 10D fits very nicely with two other lenses and a flash. However, if you have a vertical grip like I do you will find that the camera is a bit snug. Also it is lacking specialised compartments for things like flash cards and betteries. Would have been nice. Padding is adequite but not great. Could have been thicker.My 2 cents"
5,Love this backpack,"We've had this camera bag backpack for over a year now. It's durable and practical - and easy to carry the weight.It's not really ""easy access"" like some I've seen, but if you are a casual photographer that wants to carry a camera when hiking or vacationing, this would work well."
4,Great Bag!,"This is a fantastic bag. I love the way my camera slips so easily into the top - just ready to grab out at any time. Easily adjusts to fit all of my equipment including my 2 lil point and clicks. As was mentioned before, it could be improved with some interior straps but I don't open my bag too hastily anyway. This bag was so worth the expense and has made my shoots so much easier. (I also like the fact that it just looks like an ordinary backpack - reducing its attraction to thieves)."
3,Good for the price,"I'm not one for writing reviews. I figured I would just say a few words. This bag is worth the money, its comfortable, and holds a lot of equipment. I use mine as a carry on as well. The main complaint I have is that the zippers are fairly loose. I'll explain... Since its a backpack type bag, I like having the zippers meet in the middle, at the top and unzip it down. Sometimes the zippers work themselves free, and then slide down, and the pocket begins to open. luckily I have always managed to notice, and stop it before dumping all my gear. I have since resorted to pulling the zippers to one side and swinging it off of my shoulder to open it from one side. For the money, it's great, because I refuse to pay 100 dollars or more for a bag. Padding is good, and it has a lot of storage space."
2,A fair bag...,"The bag is spacious and can be used to tote an ample amount of equipment. The straps, however, are thin and uncomfortable. Also, opening it up to get a specific item is laborious and unless you remove the bad and lay it flat you risk spilling equipment. After using this bag for a short time I retired it in lieu of a SlingShot"
2,Too small and thin,"This bag was too small for my Canon 1D Mark II so I had to return it. The padding seems very thin too, especially in the area on top where the camera is supposed to fit. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with professional gear."
4,Very Pleased,This backpack has a lot of usable protected space for the money. I'm finding that I can pack what I need for a particular outing and still have plenty of room left for those extras I never seem to be able to leave at home. The price is very fair and my equipment feels very secure even when not packed to the gills.
5,"Bad zippers, but otherwise excellent","I've taken this thing all over from Hawaii to New York to Florida to New Mexico. It's sturdy, has lots of compartments and protects my gear. It's great, and I have no complaints except that the zippers are kind of crummy. Be careful with them, and you're fine. I also blacked out the Canon logo so that fewer people would know of the treasures stored inside. :)"
3,Too big for a day trip,"For the photographer out on a weekend shoot, this backpack has room for everything. For a photography enthusiast, with only 1 SLR and 2 lenses, this pack was too bulky and heavy."
3,canon photo back paqck,I like the layout of the backpack but the only problem I have with it is the direction that the the cover for the zipper was put on. it should be the opposite of what it is. When you have the backpack on everything can get under the tab including rain instead of running or falling off. I bought it to keep dirt and moisture off of my camera and lenses. I'm not talking severe weather just moderate weather so I probably would buy something different if you are real concerned about thse problems
2,Dissapointed,"When I decided to get backpack for my new camera I figure I would get a Canon backpack for my Canon DSLR. I previously owned a Nikon and bought a Nikon backpack and was pleased. I have to admit the price is the first thing that caught my attention. So I started to read the reviews and found good and bad reviews, more of them good then bad. So I decided to buy the backpack and when it came in I was dissapointed. The saying is true that you get what you pay for. I like the layout of the backpack, it had plenty of room and pockets. The padding was not very thick and seemed like there was no protection if I was to bump into something. The bottom line is, I didn't feel safe putting my camera in this bag. So I did more research and bought a KATA R-102. The moral of the story is, Don't skimp on the bag after you've already spent a couple thousand on a camera!"
5,Great Camera Case,"I purchased this camera case about 3 weeks ago and I have found it to be all that I needed. I have always hated the traditional camera bag that straped over my shoulder and for a long time, I avoided taking my cameras with me because they seemed bulky. Now I no longer feel this way since the backpack style is so much easier to bring along. It also gave me all the space that I needed to keep all my equipment in one place."
4,Inexpensive but good camera bag,"I can load a Nikon D80 w/55-200mm lens, a D70 body, 18-70mmlens,Nikon SB800, 50mm lens and a lot of accessories, manuals... Don't forget to hide the label Canon that can attract thieves who get you in trouble. This good bag doesn't cost too much like other brands. It has enough room for your cameras' gears.Why don't you get it ?"
4,Excellent bag for the $$$,"An excellent camera bag for the money. A basic bag with most of the necessary compartments that one needs. The only complaint is that the main zipper is quite loose on mine and it takes very little effort for it to completely unzip. I haven't had a disaster yet, so in the meantime I'm contemplating how to reduce its likelihood. Overall I'm very happy with it, especially at half of the price of other comparable bags."
4,Camera Backpack,"The Canon 200EG backpack for their EOS Cameras is an exceptional value. If you have different lenses you want to carry and want them available yet have your arms free from carrying a camera bag, I readily recommend this product. It easily handles many different sizes of lenses. For your money, you cannot beat this product if you want to carry your camera and lenses and feel confortable about your investment being well protected. The only drawback I found is I feel it does not come with enough elastic straps to keep everything in place, but this is easily corrected with a visit to a nearby fabric store."
5,Top-quality Bag at a very low price,"You can spend a lot more money for such a high quality bag. Large but not too large. Holds all of my 6 lenses, and the body, and a flash, and more."
3,Great at first site- not good with heavy telephoto lenses,"When I first received the bag, I was very happy with it. I was able to customize the inside padding to fit exactly what I needed to put in there.However, after loading all of my equipment (Canon 40D with battery grip, 70-200 f/2.8L IS, speedlite 580ex ii, 15mm fisheye, 24-70 f/2.8L) the sturdiness of the bag decreased immensely.When I put it on my back the back of the bag sagged, causing the equipment to hit each other. the stitching in the zipper and skirt ripped after only a few uses.****Would not recommend if using heavy lenses****"
1,"Broken Zipper, Broken Equipment","The bag was fantastic for the first year I had it, but for serious photojournalists who find themselves in situations that involve a lot of walking, getting in and out of the bag, taking the bag on and off, it wears down fast. The bottom of the bag was actually worn to the point the plastic bottom was coming out. Last night, the zipper broke open as I was walking down the street and $6,000 in equipment hit the concrete. I gave that bag a lot of use and it was pretty good for a while, in the end it cost me BIG."
1,Canon Backpack 200EG,"I bought the backpack hoping it would be useful. The plastic zipper kept unraveling, and that was the end of my using it. It is in the garage somewhere. I regret purchasing it."
3,"Comfortable, yet unsafe for equipment","This is by far the most comfortable backpack I own. But I have only rated this 3 stars because of lack of security and inconvenience. My camera and all lenses and attachments fit in the Canon bag, plus my extra camera bodies. Yet, the only part I feel secure with is the part of the bag where my camera and lens combo fit. This part has a strap with velcro, which tightens across the lens to keep it secure in the bag. Unfortunately, all of the compartments are open,(meaning there is nothing with which to secure the lenses and other equipment) which means that anytime I want to access anything from the main body of the bag I have to take it and lay it down so I don't lose anything. So, even tho this is a GREAT value and extremely comfortable...it is the bag that I keep all of the equipement in that I am not using. I use my Lowepro Slingback 200 for day jaunts and short trips, and I am still looking for my ""perfect' bag. (any suggestions?)"
5,canon camera bag,Has just enough space to carry extra lens and even a backup camera. But not too bulky. Highly recommend it for people with slr or dslr cameras. I love it!
1,zipper broke on the first outing!,I was so dissapointed in this bag; the very first time I used it the main compartment zipper broke!!!! I really wish I had ordered the Tamrac for just a few dollars more.
1,This bag cost me $400+,"First use, I had my Canon 60D and EF-S 18-135mm IS lens in the backpack. The bags main compartment was zipped and zippers met in the middle (big mistake). First awkward position I was in climbing down a rock face the weight of the camera opens the zipper and my camera goes flying out and hit the rocks below (about 6' drop). The lens broke in half, the camera seems to be OK (thank God, otherwise this poor design would have cost me over $1000). You could lessen the chance of this happening by having zippers meet at the end of the zippered section, but his is a very poor design risking expensive equipment, and it's not very comfortable to boot. It's inexpensive to buy, expensive to own. I'll never use it again."
2,good looking bag and my lens just pops out of it.,"I got it about a month ago. I love it as the style is so modern looking. Also have canon brand to induce the theft to steal your camera as well. When I got it first I transfer all my gear from my old bag to this bag. Then I was trying to grap the top holder. The zipper just snapped open and one of my zoom lens fell out of this bag on the ground. I was mad. Since I just had it only less than an hour. I decided to put it back in a box and returned to amazon and got my credit back in about two weeks. Eventually, I bought a samsonite worldproof instead. Hope this help you."
5,Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras (Black with Green Accent),"Well constructed bag, easily customizable. I find the shoulder straps to be a little uncomfortable. It holds quite a bit but is smaller than i expected. In the default configuration my Canon 7D with battery grip does not fit. It is too tall to close the zipper. If you flip around the whole set of inserts it fits but the dividers stick up. Its a great bag for traveling when you arent taking all your gear, but doesnt work as a place to store all your stuff when not using it if you have quite a bit. Overall i would recommend this bag for a small travel backpack."
5,lots of space and comfy,very good back bag .... lots of space to fit a big camera + lenses .... really comfortable to put in the back.i'm very happy with my purchase !!!
4,I love this bag,"It's comfortable, has good padding & a lot of pockets. I've been using this bag for several years now and I feel my equipment is completely safe inside it."
5,Super Great Necessity!,"Holds so much! Customizable. I just slip my camera in with zoom lenses intact. I keep an extra battery grip on my camera body and it fits too. Extra pockets for accessories, manuals, water bottle, etc. Bag is waterproof! Great construction!!!!! A Must Have!!!!!"
5,Great pack,"Camera and accessories are well protected in this lightweight, comfortable pack. Velcro padded dividers allow easy customization. Camera quickly accessible via top zipper. I paid 29.95 which I thought was a great price for the value."
3,Canon Photo Backpack review,"I bought this for a Canon Digital Rebel XT. Its bigger/bulkier than I expected, almost as big as the backpack my kids use for their school books. It also didn't come with any information/instructions explaning what the different pockets, straps, etc. are intended to be used for. On the positive side, its constructed very well & I like the movable, yet secure, dividers allowing customization for different lens, etc. I wish there were more straps to help secure the camera or a lens."
4,Great Bag ... Great Price,There are so many companies that make camera bags ... for it's size this bag is a great value.
3,Nice bag but not all that comfortable,"I think the bag is well made and meets my needs except after wearing it a bit the straps cut into my shoulders. Grant it, I am a larger woman and it will be difficult to find a bag that is comfortale."
3,Waterproof??????,"I like this bag a lot, everything I expected. It is not, however, anything close to waterproof. In a light to moderate rain storm it will leak like crazy. Lucky I tested it before we used it."
4,Great Bag for the price,Bag has lots of storage. Heavy Duty zippers. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is it's not super comfortable for me because I'm 6'5. My wife loves it she is 5'8
3,Not too Bad...,"I have no problems with service or delivery whatsoever.The backpack is a nice starter peice but not recommended for enthusiasts. The backpack is small, and the shoulder straps are wanting. The interior is nice and there are sufficient pockets and sufficient space for starter gear.Not too Bad..."
5,Much better than a camera bag,I have been using a canon camera bag for the last 10 years. Decided to try this when it went on sale... Wow... what a difference it makes when lugging a lot of equipment around. Highly recommended.
3,Canon Deluxe Photo backpack,"Lots of room for both my D-SLR's and 4 lenses, spare batteries, battery chargers, etc. etc. Nice slip clips for attaching a monopod or knee pad on either side of the bag. My only complaint (which is a global complaint of just about any product made in Asia) is that the zippers seem sort of cheap. I expect the bag to outlast the zippers as in many products such as backpacks and coats."
4,Nice backpack,"Easy, fast access to everything. Water resistant. Could be a bit more comfortable to wear."
5,Very nice and orginized,I love my day pack. I carry my camera with a couple of extra lens and I am also able to carry my mini video camera as well.
4,This bag was just right for me,"I purchased this bag because I had more gear than my old one could carry. I have a DSLR body with battery grip, two medium size zoom lenses, a long 70-200mm f/2.8, a tele-conveter, a flash, and some miscellaneous cords, filters, and stuff. This bag has plenty of room for all of it and some space to spare. It feels comfortable when I wear it with all my stuff in it and hike around. It has some exterior pockets for getting at some extra things quickly. I also use the roping on the back-side to hold my jacket.All in all its very nice."
5,"Awesome bag, and a GREAT price!","I was given this bag by my fiance as a gift for our wedding. I am very BIG into taking pictures, and we go off roading all the time and the bag I had before just didnt work well for our offroading. This bag is great its VERY durable, and has lots of storage space, and protects my camera and lens and such very well. Im very happy with this bag, and wish I had gotten it much sooner."
3,A safe home for all your toys,"I recieved this a a gift.. a very nice gift indeed. It holds all my photography goods, and I worry no longer about bumps and such. It's been in rain and lots of snow, and has never let me down. It has a nicely customizable interior that can make room for even the gangliest of items. I hav a Canon 300MM, 17-55mm ef-s, 2 speedlights, a 50mm, and several other little odds and ends including several filters, tripod adapters, ect..It holds them all, and just screams, ""lets go on an adventure"".. in fact I hear it calling right now..."
5,Loving It!!!!,Love this bag. It holds my 60d with room to spare. I got all my lens with lots of room to space. Highly recommend. design let's me get camera out without opening the whole bag. And the price is fantastic!
4,Great price but.,It is nice for the price but its also a bit small for me I would like it to be 20% larger and have a larger side pouch for food snacks but in the market of camera bags it is one of the best for the money.
4,I think I got too big of a bag.,"I only have one camera body and a pair of lenses and a flash so while it all fits nicely it's just too bulky for me to carry around. I'm in a wheelchair so putting it on my back isn't a great option either. But it does what it's designed to do, carry your stuff."
5,awesome,exactly as shown... the packing was perfect ... just it would be better if the picture was with a human as the bag seems to be smaller than it appears...
5,Great Value,"I was looking for a bag that would carry additional gear for a month long trip. This bag, for the price, is an exceptional value. First it holds a lot of camera gear. It is comfortable to wear. There is room for an iPad or small laptop, a rain jacket, water bottles and a tripod.On the negative side you will have to put the bag down to get gear out. It's not a sling bag. You will also have to exercise some care as the bag while padded is not as padded as others but with reasonable care this should be manageable.For $39.00 you cannot go wrong buying it."
5,Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras,"Great camera bag! Holds everything I need for my Digital Rebel xti, including 2 filters 2 additional lenses, flash and additional pockets for memmory cards, books etc."
4,Great bag for the price,"Great bag for the prices. It's not a high end bag, but it is made well an is exactly what I was looking for."
5,Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras,"I bought this backpack for my husband's Cannon EOS Camera and lenses. He loves it because all the stuff fit well inside, including his portable DVD player.Now he is ready for another vacation.Happy wife."
1,very disallusioned,"I bought this bag last July. The first week one seam came apart, the next week a zipper broke. Two weeks later another seam came apart. A month later another seam came apart. The week after that another zipper broke. I have all of my new equipment in the bag and it is just about full. I would not recommend anyone buy this bag unless you want your expensive equipment to fall out! Very disappointed! However the padding inside is nice."
3,Not incredibly durable,"I like the size and flexibility of this bag, but just be forewarned that it's not especially durable. Admittedly, I tend to abuse and overstuff my bags, but this one tore slightly at the seem near the zipper so it's not built for abuse. I repaired the tear and it's held up fine since.I do like all of the extra padding, but it would be even better with velcro straps to hold everything in tight.You also have to make sure both zippers are closed all the way or the bag may come open at an inopportune time. This is not good!Overall, I like the looks and flexibility of the bag, but considering my habits next time I will opt for paying more for a more durable bag."
3,"Great Features, Poor Build Quality","I really like the design and features, bought this for a vacation. One of the zipper tabs broke on day one, the logo came off on day three, and the stitching around the main compartment zipper started coming undone at the end of the week. I'm going to reach out to Canon customer service for a replacement, very disappointed considering I have one of their shoulder bags from the 90's still in great condition."
5,EXCELLENT VALUE!!!,This is a great pack for the price. Most aftermarket backpacks are over $100 but at this price nothing can compare. Plenty of room for my meager setup so might not be the thing for professionals but for me it's perfect! Until I get more stuff....
4,Great pack,Lot of space for the serious amateur. Lightweight yet sturdy. Only complaint is that it comes unzipped easily if picked up the wrong way.
3,Camera backpack,This is a great backpack that lets you carry a camera and several lenses and other accessories. The downside of this bag is the size. the nose (top) is not as deep as the rest of the bag. Also the sides are a bit soft and may only offer minimum protection
3,Not as large as I thought,"When I looked into buying this backpack, it was pictured with two cameras, lenses and other camera accessories. I have two cameras, a wide angle, telephoto and zoom lens plus other accessories and am not able to fit all of the equipment into the bag the way I thought I would. I now have two camera bags to accomodate my equipment - disappointed."
4,Satisfied,The backpack has a lot of space inside to keep all your accessories organized. I was able to hold 3 small soda bottles in one of the pockets. I like the fact that it has a strap to hold a tripod. Overall I'm pleased with the product.
5,Great Bag,"I have had this bag now for a bit over 6 months. I travel a lot throughout the year to sometimes very exotic destinations. I am a camera/photography enthusiast, and have decent equipment. It was just a pain to carry it all sometimes due to the lack of propper carrying gear. Sumarizing the whole thing, I am able to carry my Digital Rebel XT, 3 lenses of various sizes, to include a wide angle and a telephoto, all the accesories of my XT, charger, filters, cables, hood for the lenses ect, and let me add that that I also carry a Minolta Dimage A200 as a secondary camera, with many add ons to it as well, and don't let me forget the lip gloss and girly stuff my girl adds to my bag as well. All of that and it is not stuffed! The compartments are great and reconfigurable. And I love the little CANON logo, where everybody can see it. Nice bag, Worth the money"
4,Almost a great bag.,"Nicely padded, reasonably well crafted. Someone said once it would fit a 12"" ibook. Well, it sort of does. But then the seam of the pocket that supposedly fits it tore, so I can't do that anymore. I'm discovering the backpack idea just isn't for me anyway, it's comfortable but really inconvenient. I've almost dropped lenses trying to open the bag without setting it down first. I know, my fault, but this isn't the bag for me, obviously. If you want a good, cheap bag, buy it. Just realize you can't treat it like you would a $70-$100 bag and you'll be fine,"
5,Great camera bag,"Great bag, inside is configurable with the velcro dividers. I can easily fit all my gear in it. Smaller front zippered pouch can fit a book and the other zippered pocket can hold my laptop (14""). It has accessory straps all over but I removed them - you can easily put them back on if needed. I also took a tip from one of the reviewers and sewed the buckle strap across the front for added security, simple needle and thread job. Front lashing is very useful and the overall material of the bag is very sturdy."
4,Fantastic deal and I could not be happier,"I went ahead and read most reviews on this back pack. One thing to realize is if you are looking for a backpack to carry a lot of your gear and protect it this may be for you. If you are looking for a ""Pro"" or custom back pack you may want to look else where. I looked at several options for back packs and for what I need as a hobbyist and not a professional this really fits perfectly. I read where people are wanting to have very easy access to their equipment while on the go and this is the type of backpack that you will need a little bit of time and area to set the pack down to remove equipment properly and safely. This is what I carry in my bag:Canon 50d18-55mm lens50mm lens1 flashSony hand held video camerachargers for both camerasmemory cardsodds and endsI still have room for the 24-70mm I want to pick up."
4,Great for a beginner photographer +,"This is the first camera bag that I have bought as I start my career as a photographer and it is good for know. There are enough pockets and compartments for my dSLR, flash, lens, and my Point and shoot camera as well. I also have stashed in it my extra memory cards and batteries. It has a dedicated tripod strap that is on the underside of the pack. The outside ""light jacket holder"" is a joke and it appears to be more for decoration than anything else. I would have like to have small zipper pockets for my memory cards instead of the elastic pockets."
4,Canon Deluxe Photo Bag,"I am VERY satisfied with this product. Great storage options - moveable dividers. Great for the recreational photographer. I am able to fit my Canon DSLR, multiple lenses, video camera, digital camera, and all necessary chargers/cords that are associated with each piece of equipment, plus much more. Also has external straps, so taking a tripod along with you is no inconvenience. Not too mention, it was HALF the price of any retail store! Even has a hip belt, which makes hiking with this pack very comfortable. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!! Highly recommend!"
2,Nice design but poor stitching,I thought this one had what it took but it coming apart like a worn down boxer a the seams. I just finished doing a little stitching on the fella but I don't know how he's going to hold up :(
2,Needs Improvement!!,"My first trip out with this bag was disappointing. The zippers broke off in my hand like a cookie as well as the Canon logo. The stitching on the flaps covering the zipper ripped and left a hanging raveling mess. It is not nearly as water resistant as they claim it is. We also got rained on that very same day! The equipment in the main compartment got wet but not damaging so (I tried to keep it covered) however, everything in the front pockets was not so lucky. This would be a awesome bag if it was better made. When I first received it, it seemed to have been very well made. It does hold everything I need it to securely, with room left to spare. If you purchase this bag do so at a discounted price. DO NOT pay full price for it!"
2,Looked good at first but the detailed reviews make it clear.,"The reviews here in display a wealth of information. The thing that glared at me were ""you have to put the bag on the ground to open it up"". Bad news, especially if you are shooting bear at Cooper Landing, to make matters worse is the mention of the two inch wide straps (hiker's night mare) and the fact the bag is not rain proof.... sticking zippers and things falling out when opened was enough to convince this is not the bag for me. Of course neither is the one I am married to but I still love her."
2,The zip too easily opened,"This bag is ok if you don't put too much stuff in it. Because the zip opens easily all the way to bottom, if you have too much stuff, or if something (e.g, tree trigs) is catching the flap, it will be widely open in less than 1 sec, and all your expensive equipment will likely fell to the ground. That will be a few thousands $ loss. This will also happen when you are not using extreme caution when opening the bag to retrieve stuff.So please be cautious if you wish to buy this bag. It's UNSAFE. The should have some locking mechanism for the bag."
3,Decent bag for the price,Pro's:Large bagGood design with lots of good sized pocketsPerfect for taking a short tripThe priceCon's:The zippers are very poorly madeEverything about feels low quality although nothing has broken yet.Doesn't live up to the Canon name
2,False Advertisement,"At first I was impressed with functionality of compartments of this bag and how easily adjustable they are to fit my 20D, different lenses, flash, etc. As other reviewers have said, it fits a lot of camera equipment.However, future use revealed a huge flaw in design and most troubling - in technical data on this backpack. Canon states that it is ""Constructed of waterproofed polyester and nylon"" and ""Water repellant and urethane coated for extra durability"" BUT, the bag lucks all this protection on the side that leans to your back, when you wear it (padded side), so water from rain easily seeps inside backpack. I got under rain and mist for about 3 hours and all equipment was wet from back, padded side. This is totally unacceptable! I got to return it."
4,Canon 200EG,"I am new to photography so I do not have anything to compare this with. But I was looking for an inexpensive,well made starter back pack and this one fills the part very well. It is well built and holds what I want for now."
3,camera position is whack,"This is a great camera bag for the price, has all of the adjustable straps you could ask for and feels relatively sturdy. However, I was surprised at the odd layout choice they made for the camera body + attached lens -- right at the top of the bag, and honestly this is the area with the least amount of padding. I can see how this would provide quickest access to the camera, but I think I want more shock padding around the camera than some of my other gear. Huh."
5,Simply Awesome,"I shopped camera bags at many locations, including Best Buy when I purchased my new camera purchase. I wanted something that would really protect my camera when I travel but not be awkward to carry around. I found this bag at Best Buy for $79.99. After looking at it and taking it apart at the store I ran home and purchased for a MUCH lower price at Amazon. The value and quality is just wonderful. So glad I purchased and have already traveled many times with absolute security & safety for my Canon Rebel XTI. It is large inside but not too bulky. Holds my 80mm & 300 mm lens perfectly and also have plenty of room for my smaller digital camera & video camera. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a durable bag for their digital camera."
3,"Satisfactory, not great",This bag is certainly big enough for the rebel and extra lenses. I can also fit my videocamera in it to be fully packed for a digital day. I don't love it because it's too big.
2,"It should be considered a storage bag, not a backpack","While this bag works great as a storage device (customizable compartments and plenty of room for a number of accessories) it should NOT be considered for use as a backpack. The straps and the bag itself are poorly designed with regards to comfort while using as a ""backpack"". The straps are nothing to write home about, but worse still are the inside components of the bag that, when carried as a backpack, create pressure points throughout the back of the bag and cause discomfort over even the shortest distances.If you simply need a gear bag, this will work great. If you plan on carrying your gear on your back, look for a different pack."
2,"not durable, poor construction","I completely like the design of this bag, but I took it brand new on a 3 week trip to India. I carried it with me everyday and by the end of the 3 weeks, it had 2 rather large rips at the seams where the main compartment zipper is. One of the rips occurred during only the 2nd week of use. I'd recommend a more durably constructed bag."
5,great bag,"Received this bag about 3 weeks ago. I have a Nikon D80 with 2 lenses, the charger, cables, lens covers, etc. I like how everything fits in the bag, and I can fit more stuff too. If you only have one camera and one lens, this bag may be too big. I like all of the pockets and compartments in it. The only thing I don't like is the canon logo on the front, top. Nothing against Canon personally, but it screams ""there's a camera in here!"" I will try to take it off if I can. Took it on a trip this past weekend, and really liked it. Overall, it's nicely padded with many good features, a versatile bag, and I have already recommended it to a friend."
3,Huge,"If you have lots of lens and accessaries this is your bag. If you want something compact and elegant, you probably should keep looking. I find this a bit gawky and much too large for normal use."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"I absolutely love this camera bag!!!! It is perfect for holding all my gadgets, lenses and has room for much more!!!! I encourage anyone who loves to take photographs to buy it."
4,camera bag,"bag has plenty of space for slr, lens and misc products. would rate EXCELLENT if it had straps, and a tad more room in the front. v good product, made well -- good price too."
2,Zipper doesn't stay closed,"The bag is easy to use: It opens out flat which makes for easy accessing of equipment. The big drawback is the main compartment where the lenses are kept has a double zipper-left and right sides. While I was carrying a full pack one of the side zippers worked it's way down and one of my lenses fell out and crashed to the cement! Now I safety pin the 2 zippers together at the top, and still with the weight of the bag the zip works it's way open as much as the safety pine allows it."
2,"Nice bag, very uncomfortable","Bag is pretty good for a typical amateur photographer. Holds about 3-4 lenses on top of a mounted one. Has lots of pockets and compartments. Biggest (and only) complaint is that it is extremely uncomfortable to wear around. The design of it is too boxy and the way they designed the straps makes it sit very awkwardly on your back.I hope they redesign the straps, otherwise that's the biggest downfall."
5,Perfect bag for a guy!,I bought this for my nephew and he's loving it. The storage is great and the padding is protective without being too much.
4,Great deal,"Plenty of room in the bag for whatever you got. Plenty of outside straps to carry whatever else you got. Material isn't great quality, but very sturdy.Best camera backpack for the price."
5,Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack,I love this backpack. It's perfect for all of my camera accessories. It's not too big or too small and has a whole bunch of pockets for all my filters and other extras including my binoculars. It also has straps to hold my tripod so I don't have to lug it around while I'm walking which is great! The best part is that it doesn't cost 180$ like most of the others do. I'd reccommend this to anyone who enjoys outdoor photography.
3,Just OK,"I was so excited to get this and then as others have commented, was not thrilled with how easily things could fall out. I thought the backpack would be just what I need. I travel a lot, and was disappointed that this was not an easy bag to switch lenses. I had to find a flat area and open it carefully for fear of a lens falling out. I am going back to my old bag which when carried across my body made lens changes much easier."
4,Nice backpack,Got this item for hubby for christmas. He likes it. The bag has two removable partitions that velcro in at any place you want them to in the bag. It could have a little more partitioning to secure small things like lenses and caps but overall does what we need it to do. There is a strap for your tripod on the bottom and a couple pockets on the sides. It looks good on the outside and the straps are comfortable and adjustable. The price was great for what you get - most camera backpack bags are three times the cost. So it is a good value.
5,Canon Backpack,"Stop searching, I put ALL my stuff (and is very large)inside and went for the adventure, this is it!!Saludos, Allan."
1,Horrible,This bag is horrible. If you value your equipment don't buy it. Your lens don't fit it tight with the simple velcro. There needs to be some better way to hold your stuff in there. Your stuff will come spilling out the first time you forget to zip the top. Complete waste of money with a nice canon logo. As soon as one lens comes tumbling out you will wish you had never bought it.
1,poor quality,this backpack was very uncomfortable. the inserts are stiff. it doesn't represent canon quality (I hope).
4,Canon Bag,I got this item in a timely manner. I wish the one of the zipper handle did not break off to fast. Other than its been great.
4,Great bag for the price,"Stylish, high-quality, nice features. I am very happy with this bag. My only disappointment is that it doesn't hold *quite* as much as I had been led to believe, but ideal for most."
1,Horrible!!! Literally fell apart at the seam in under 6 months!,I got the bag as a christmas present and it has COMPLETELY fallen apart due to manufacterer crappiness. BUY something else!
2,Only if your gear is cheap.,"I had a 40D 24-70L and a 70-200L IS in the pack. After walking around with the pack on for about an hour the zippers peeled open and dumped my gear on the pavement! Fortunately I have insurance to cover the damage. (the enses actually held up very well to the impact but still sustained some damage) I have a small clip for the zippers now to ensure they stay closed until I can replace this POS bag.If your gear is cheap and light then sure use this but back up the zippers with a clip.Bottom line, don't buy this bag."
2,Too small,"I have a laptop backpack, and I was hoping that this one would hold my laptop as well. It doesn't. In fact, it's very tiny. I'm 6'3"" tall, and this just looks weird on me. It's too bad, because despite its size, it's very well constructed and will certainly hold your camera equipment securely. I'd have also liked a better system for holding your tripod. Velcro would have made this sooo much easier. As it is, the tripod straps are hard to adjust, and in the case of my tripod, the straps are almost not big enough. It's very hard to get the tripod in and out. If not velcro, then some sort of clasp, like what they have on the front of the back pack (between the arm straps) would work. Something that you could easily open and close.Unfortunately, I had to travel right after I bought this thing, and I can't return it. BUMMER! Maybe I can get rid of it on eBay or something."
5,Great little backpack,"I've just got this back pack in the mail and was absolutely surprised with quality and functionality that it provides. Very light, stylish, it can fit my camera, 2 lenses and there is plenty of place left for different accessories. It has a big front pocket, straps for the tripod (at the bottom) and it's weather proof too.Also, it looks a lot better than the picture. A lot better than the packs I saw in retail stores for $100 and up.Highly recommended."
4,Well made backpack - I'm sure my lenses will be happy.,"This is a high quality backpack with lots of padding and protection for my lenses. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it. There are also some extra pouches - the very front has a string enclosure - that's to stuff a lightweight jacket - I haven't tried it but it seems like plenty of space. Then there's a small zippered area behind that - nice to have an extra pocket... AND one more zippered area - this one larger and has room for memory cards - although the memory card slots seem a little tight if you are using CF cards, but lots of room in this compartment, including two elastic pockets for storing a wall charger or cables, or whatnot. Then the big compartment for the camera and lenses. Lots of room for lenses here and the slots are reconfigurable thanks to velcro."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!,"I received my bag on Saturday (2 days ago). Just put my gear in it to go shooting tomorrow and it started desintegrating at the stiches. Has a big 3 inch tear in the front, where the green fabric connects to the black fabric. Yes, it is very roomy for all your equipment but it is cheap made. The funny thing is I can not return it because I removed the cannon metal logo and I put a butterfly patch in there. So I am stuck with a piece of crap that I did not used not even ONCE. I am so mad I could scream! Again, buyers beware, this bag will desintegrate. If you want to waste 40 dollars, go for it, but you were warned."
5,Happy,Received this product recently and am very HAPPY with product. Will be giving to a friend as a present and hope they will appreciate is as they hike alot and this will protect the camera now.
1,Canon is hurting themselves with their name on this pack.,"I bought this pack because it was inexpensive and quickly found out that the ""You get what you pay for"" rule definitely applies to camera packs. With over $4500 worth of gear to put in it, I promptly returned this pack when I saw the horrible quality zipper on the main compartment.First off, this is a very small pack... for a larger person like me, the pack just didn't fit right (I almost ran out of room on the pull straps when wearing the pack). The zipper on the main compartment was defective and kept coming open (from both the zipper pulls as well as from the opposite end. Yikes!A 20D or larger body would have a difficult time fitting into this pack.Remember: ""You get what you pay for""."
2,"okay for budget-minded, but not pro quality","I've owned MANY backpacks (more than 20) for various activities (backpacking, hiking, photography, computer, every day use, travel, etc) over the past 35 years. And I'm a fairly serious semi-pro photographer with Canon 40D and 50D, bunch of lenses, strobist setup, and studio lighting setup. This Canon pack is marginally ""okay"" as a camera pack, and just ""okay"" value for the price. Before you buy, compare to (look at and touch) packs with more structure and protection, safe ease of use, and better suspension. I was given this pack, yet I spent money on a couple different LowePro packs to use for actual jobs. The Canon 200EG is ""okay"" for very lightweight duty or storing extra lenses and gear at home, but if you want to really get the job done, spend twice as much and get one that'll keep you happy as you use it, be comfortable to wear, protect your gear, and make it easy to get your camera fast."
4,"Great bag, if it fits you right.","I bought this for all my gear and it fits! I was able to put in my: Sony Camcorder, Canon SD750, Canon G9, underwater housing for the two cameras, and 2 lenses for the G9. I thought the bag was comfortable, but my husband thought it was too small for him. I'm 5'6"" / average and he's 5'11 / 260lbs, with broad shoulders.I would suggest taking off the Canon logo on the bag just to deter theft."
5,JUST BUY !,"I'm a person of few words. After using this back pack for 6 months, all I can say is that all of the reviews are true. I love this camera case!!"
5,Great product!,"I absolutely love the backpack. It is very well made, plenty of room for my camera and accessories. It also can carry my powerbook and tripods, so it makes the perfect portable photo studio. Wonderful backpack."
4,Great for the price.,"I like this backpack. I've had it about 6 months now. The straps that were supposed to hold the tripod don't really work easily, and that is my only real complaint."
1,Shoddy and Weak Construction,"I'm a big man, so maybe it's just me...but with a fully loaded camera bag, I expect the shoulder straps to last...what...a couple years? 3 months...and one of them already seperated at the top...lucky I didn't drop the gear.If you're broke, or really cheap, use the bag. It divides nicely, and carries plenty. The lace crap on the outside snags on everything, but does hold waterbottles nicely.I got a Promaster bag...MUCH HAPPIER!!! Even has a real Tripod mount, whereas this has little plastic cleats, two of which ripped out first week."
4,Best Deal in it's Price Range,"As simple as they come, but it does the job. I've been using this bag for over a year now. It fits my filters, 3 lenses, a A Photo/CD Burning drive and two flash units. Still room for several nick-nacks, etc.The only minor complaint is ther is no great way to strap a small tripod to the backpack. I used the small straps on the side, but the straps broke through the plastic fasteners that were holding them on. I'm now getting creative with the bungie laces on the back of the bag.That said, I really didn't expect a backpack at this price point to be as good as it is. So 4.5 stars."
4,it is what it is,"This product performs exactly as described. Very roomy, lots of individual pockets, and well padded for fragile items. Comfortable carrying straps. The only thing that would improve on this is wheels...it can get heavy."
2,Zippers Ruin What Could Have Been an Awesome Pack,"Have had this for a little more than a year now. At first I loved it -- it holds a lot of gear.A year later, I would not buy the bag if I had it to do over again.The zippers are very, VERY loose -- the loosest of any bag I have ever seen. If they are not zipped-tied together, or the straps threaded through each other, the zippers come open on their own. If you have the bag more than about 1/3 full, the weight of the gear pulls the zippers completely open -- end to end. They unzip UNBELIEVABLY easily, so you're guaranteed to bounce all your camera gear off the ground if you don't secure the zippers.I've not damaged any equipment with it -- hopefully never will, but I've come close a couple times.No excuse why a CAMERA gear bag from CANON should have this issue -- they know exactly what kind of equipment is at risk by using such poor quality zippers."
4,Great for the money,"Although it's not the best bag, I must admit for the price it's just splendid and does what it needs to do. Plus, it carries a lot of equipment."
4,Great Backpack,It's a great backpack. Does as advertised lots of cells and padding. My only gripe is when the pack is loaded and you have it on your back the design of the straps are somewhat narrow on top that it squeezes and rubs the nape of your neck. It gets irritating after awhile.
2,Not of great quality.,"My bag suffered a tear at the top after minimal use. Also, make sure the zipper is close ALL the way, because it might just swing open at anytime causing your equipment to fall off."
5,Big enough for my equipment!,"Bought this a little over a year ago; started with very few items to go in it, mainly bought it at the time because it was 1/3rd of the price than what Best Buy was selling it for! Any way since i bought it i've added a 60D with battery grip (yes it does fit attached), canon 15-85,sigma 150-500 & tamron 70-300 lens also the extra batteries,filters and anything else that goes with photography have all been in the backpack! Yes it is a little heavy but thats why i bought it for because it carries alot of equipment and feels comfortable on my back. And contrary to what others say it so far has been very durable! P.S. so thieves won't get the idea i'm possiably carrying around some expensive equipment i proceeded to sew a Jeep patch over the Canon tag on the outside as to keep wandering eyes looking else where! I'm also a Jeep fan!!!!!"
4,Very comfortable,"Perfect for take your slr camera with all its equipment (charger, extra lens, cables, etc), but Canon forgot to make a compartiment for the laptop, anyway a really like my backpack."
2,Only good for small shoulders.,"This backpack is ok, but not great. If you have a smaller body and relatively small shoulders, it will fit you perfectly. However, if you have average male-size shoulders you will find this backpack too small and uncomfortable. I've had a few friends try it on, and all the females loved it. All the males (average size) said it was too small and didn't fit comfortably. My advice is to find a store that carries it, and try it on first. It holds things well, and I generally agree with other reviews - except for the fit factor."
2,Cheap zipper material,"The other day, I was closing the main compartment and the metal zipper tab broke while i was pulling on it. 2 seconds later, the other tab broke. Just as a test, I wanted to see if i could break the remaining metal piece that was still attached and it broke like a cracker. Very cheap material!The tripod staps on the bottom are really hard to open and close. This bag was not well thought out."
5,pack just right for a hike.,"i read some reviews before i ordered this pack. it just arrived today so i have'nt had a chance to test it in the field. i packed a Canon rebel XS, 2 lenses, external hard-drive. filters, remote, usb cord, charger. there's plenty more room left. i'm waiting for a Bounce-Swivel Flash (Metz 44-AF for Canon). there's room for that and a couple more lenses so it's plenty roomy for an amateurs kit. it's not too big nor too small. appears to be well made and worth the price.other reviews have said that the zippers creep open so i did a simple fix. i'm using a twist tie to hold the zipper ends together. when you open the zips, just leave the twist tie attached to one zipper pull.all in all, i'm happy with my bag."
4,"good, not perfect",The compartments in this bag fit everything that I need to carry plus more. my only complaint is that it doesn't fit like a true backpack; the weight of the bag is distributed awkwardly unless the straps are pulled so tight that the bag is resting at the very top of the back.
5,Perfect for the price,I went shopping for a backpack style bag as I started to run out of room from a smaller camera bag I owned. I was looking for something not overpriced and nice looking. I first saw the bag at Best Buy for over $70 but when I searched online I was able to purchase brand new for $40 including shipping! The bag is perfect for me as it holds plenty of the accesories that I own. I recommend this bag for anyone looking to get started.
4,A good purchase,"This camera backpack is affordable, has a nice look, and offers plenty of space. I was not crazy about the overabundance of straps that came with it, but all but two of them can be removed, so it really wasn't a problem. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and can't wait to use the backpack while I am traveling! It will hold everything I need and keep my camera safe and dry."
4,"Really, it's a great bag.","I read many of the reviews here before I bought this bag and I admit I was a little worried. Some folks claimed the bag would unzipper itself, spilling contents to the ground and others dinged the zipper for being cheap. But I have found this bag to be anything but cheaply made or insecure. Now that I've taken it out on several photo safaris, packed with lens', I trust it completely. Maybe there was a defective batch or something, but the bag I have is sturdy, easy to get in and out of, has ample room for my gear and is as comfortable as can be expected. I love this bag. If my best friend asked me to recommend one I'd tell her to buy this one) (in fact *she's* the one who recommended it to me!). Great value here. If you're looking for a convenient way to carry your camera and all its accouterments you've found it. No regrets."
2,Junk,"Make sure you see this in person before you order. They have them at Worst Buy or Circuit Scam. This thing is about as flimsy as a diaper. The zippers are cheap junk. They will break if you breathe on them wrong. Not like the Uphill backpack I have which was only $60, but could withstand a nuclear explosion. This backpack, however, belongs to the tidal wave of ubiquitous Chinese-made trash that has inundated our market and is currently being foisted upon the American people. Did I mention there is a bright shiny ""Cannon"" logo on the front? Nothing screams ""steal my $3000 worth of equipment"" like plastering Cannon on the front. Also, the zipper opens from the back so make sure you hold on for dear life if you are in a crowd. I give it 2 stars because it does have a lot of room.Really, you should check this thing out first. It is VERY cheaply made junk."
3,Pretty good for $35.,"Bought this and later sold it because it is not very well made. Fits plenty of gear, and the price is right...but a few zipper fobs came off...not that big a deal. Good for a cheapie bag."
5,Love at first site,I have one for my canon and love it. My brother fell in love with mine. I bought it for him for Christmas. He loves it. The price was almost half of what I paid for mine. This is an awesome camera bag.
3,Can't Lock,"I dropped my camera because the zippers do not have safety locks. Zipper has a tendency to work it way down...so, now, I have a zip tie to bread tie to secure...It's okay, but, I would rather have on that locked securely."
4,Great deal,"I found the same exact product at a local Best Buy for $79.99. I must admit that this bag may have a bit more room than I need, but hey at least I have room to grow! Bag seems very sturdy and durable. Padding is pretty solid. Room for more lenses and accesories than any normal person would need and probably just enough room for a professional! Great for a day trip to amusement park, camping, hiking, or anything of that sort... can fit a very nice camera/lenses securely, snacks, drinks, a change of clothes, or whatever else you'd need. All of this room in a very compact and comfortable package. Overall GREAT BUY!"
3,"Great bag, but way many belts and weak top production","This is a great bag with rasonable price. It does have way enought space for many lens plus flash. Not heavy and comfortable to carry in the back. However, It has way many belts on both sides and bottom, the idea must come for carrying tripod, but I don't see the necessary to have so many belts because I won't carry 3 tripods in the same time. In addition, weak top production is another concern.I have to say AmazonBasics copy cat made better improvement for it.AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories (Black)http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Backpack-Cameras-Accessories-Black/dp/B002VPE1WK/ref=pd_cp_p_0"
4,Good Purchase,"The backpack has space for all my equipment and seems to be built well. The shoulder straps seem to fit a little funny, but other than that it works for what I use it for."
3,Good starter bag and best price!,"I saw this bag at another big box retailer and it was $80! I used my Amazon app on my smartphone and scanned the bar code and VOILA....it was over 50% less on Amazon! As for the bag itself, it doesn't really compare to the ""professional"" quality camera bags, but I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a backpack. All in all, it works for me. Houses all my equipment and lenses, plus room for snacks, Ipad, etc. when I am traveling. Good value for a starter bag or for someone who needs one for quick weekend trips and doesn't want to spend a lot of $$$. Also is water repellant."
5,Great bag,"I bought this bag based on reviews here and I must say I agree with all of the positive things said. The bag is well put together and has numerous compartments and pocks. I can get two camera bodies, lenses, a flash unit, 6 battery packs, a battery grip and all kinds of other odds and ends neatly stored away. It is comfortable to carry and has lots of padding to protect its precious cargo. For just over 30 bucks this bag is a bargain for sure!Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras (Black with Green Accent)"
1,Would not buy it again,"This is a great concept in theory, but it does not work. The straps began rip appart the second week I had this bag. And, I don't even have that much stuff in it. There is no place for a tripod. And, the compartments are very inneficient. :("
3,Good - But,The bag is good but with several L series lenses and a 5D Mark 2 there are fit problems. The battery grip has to be removed from the camera body to fit the body with a mounted lens in the camera section of the bag. also with an L series lens - such as the 24-105 on the camera it is hard to fit another L series in such as the 24-70 lens.
1,Very Disappointing!,"I chose this Canon backpack for an upcoming trip to Yellowstone and took it out in the field immediately to test it out. Biggest problem is that zippers slid open while I was walking with it on my back and my telephoto lens fell out on concrete and broke! I also agree that the compartments are not well designed. Not only did the velcro dividers come undone when packed (unable to hold weight of lenses) but small items such as polarizer lens cases and lenscaps slide freely underneath dividers so that you have to dig around constantly to find what you need. Also very difficult to strap tripod onto bag and when it's strapped on you have to take it completely off again in order to access anything else in bag.I am in process of trying to get a full refund on bag and trying to work out issue of damaged lens with cannon as well, and will be more careful in choosing a new bag that is better designed to replace this one."
4,Great pack. Period.,Regardless of the great price this is a great pack. Has features of packs costing 3 or 4 times as much. Plenty of storage. Very well made. Would have given it 5 stars but I'm not crazy about the big hard plastic logo.
5,Great photo backpack,"This is a great photo backpack. It's well built, light and versatile. It's price is very reasonable. I would rate it as being comparable to the Tamrac and Lowepro products in quality."
5,Great Bag!,This backpack has plenty of room for two cameras and lenses. I am able to put my rebelxti + lenses and my video camera. Plenty of pockets and moveable padding - makes it very flexible.
3,"Fits everything, however...","This bag is great in terms of handling all my gear: a Canon 20D and 580EX flash, 24-70mm L, 70-200mm IS L, and 10-20 Sigma lenses (along with all three hoods). Furthermore, it has plenty of pouches and straps outside for a tripod, and is made of quality materials. However good that sounds, the backpack has no thick support straps to lean on the hips, hence leaving all that weight on my shoulders. If you have a heavy setup like me, the backpack becomes uncomfortable mighty fast. I do not recommend it for folks with several heavy lenses. It should work fine if you have smaller lenses..."
5,Great Functionality and Value,"Wonderful at any price, exceptional value at $40. Enough room for my camera, lenses, filters, instruction manuals. Ingenious use of velcro wide straps insure that all equipment is snugly held. Well made to last. Light weight for what it holds. This backpack is well designed to spread the weight like a high end day hiking pack."
4,Very Happy,"I got this bag prior to my most recent vacation and much to my Fiancés chagrin it really served its purpose. It easily handled all of my camera gear and tripod. In addition, it served as a good carryon for storing my iPod, magazines, and snacks. The only downsize is that there should be clips for the tripod straps so be advised that it is a bit cumbersome attaching and detaching the tripod from the bag. However, for the price, this product and its quality is unbeatable"
5,Canon back pack,I love all the compartments and space. It holds two of my DSLR's with lens and even has room for my Flip video camera's and additional lenses. Not to mention the price was excellent. I got it for $41 from amazon.
5,"Great bag, great price.","I was looking for a bag that would be able to hold my new camera comfortably, and this bag definitely fits the bill. The interior is incredibly spacious. All the horizontal dividers are moveable, so it is very easy to configure the interior to fit your needs. The only knock I have is that the backpack isn't very comfortable if you have broad shoulders. My wife doesn't have any issues with comfort, but I do. But, then again, it has great capacity and is a lot cheaper than some single camera cases I've seen, so it's hardly a detractor."
5,Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG,I love it. This price is a very reasonable. The material is very good.
3,Spacious but not solid,"I store my SLR in it, but it is a soft pack. Light-weight but not very protective"
5,The perfect bag,I looked for months for the perfect backpack-type camera bag. When I saw a friend using this bag I knew I had found it. Plenty of room for my Canon 20-D with additonal lens and room for my camcorder. This bag is lightweight and affordable. This was my first purchase on Amazon.com and I was extremely satisfied with the process.
4,great value for a great pack,"Cons:- the side pocket and side straps wont hold a full size tripod (but will hold a gorilapod)- shoulder strap arent the most comfortable design, cuts in too tight around the neck- the upper chest strap arent sewn into the shoulder and will slide down and not stay where its suppose toThe previous list are just a short list of nit picking details. Overall the bag is fantastic. Hold A LOT of gears. Has many compartments to seperate and organize your equipments. It can also hold a tripod via the 2 loops on the bottom of the bag. The inside, main compartment is well padded, fully customizable layout, and does offer decent protection to the equipment. This bag has only been used in dry weather, unsure how it will handle the elements."
4,Big capacity backpack,This bag can carry a lot. It can fit my Sony A200 DSLR in there with a flash and 4 lenses and still have room left for my filers and batteries. Good price!
4,Successful the first time.,"Used this to carry Canon camera equipment on a recent birding trip. Out of the box, it took a few minutes to figure out how the separation system worked, but once I did I liked the flexibility for accommodating my specific stuff. Was able to include an SLR camera with a 70 - 300 lens attached, some periferal equipment and two separate lenses, one of which was for the spotting scope I was bringing along. There was room for more. Carried bug spray on the ouside. Since the trip included bus travel and frequent getting on and off, did not use the pack as a backpack very much. However, it was small enough to fit in the luggage rack above the seat (small bus), the clamshell opening allowed for safe extraction of equipment and a clear view of what was still in there, and I felt confient that my camera equipment was orderly, protected, and convenient to get at. I noticed one other in the group had an identical pack. Well worth the price. Was glad I bought it."
5,Fantastic Bag!!,"I purchased this bag for my Canon Rebel XSi. I had bought a few lenses and the bag I had been using was not big enough. I liked the look of this bag. It's a bit more sporty than some other bags. It looks like a regular back pack and wears like a regular back pack. I was very glad for that, because using a bag w/a shoulder strap gets a bit annoying when out walking around and such. The padded straps are comfy and it adjusts easily and comfortably. I liked the color of the bag too, it was a nice nutral color. The bag has so many little pockets and areas for things it makes organization simple! The main part of the bag is well padded and I feel very comfortable putting my camera and lenses in there knowing they are well protected. Great value as well. It's moderately priced for such a good sized bag. It was a bit bigger than I expected so I was nervous at first that it would be ""too"" big, but everything fits so well and I still have room for extras. I love this bag."
4,Mostly a great product,"This is one of those products that is just shy of 5 stars. The bag is great, but there are just some small details that need to be fixed, and then this bag would be the bag of all bags. Small things, like... The straps on the bag for storing monopods or tripods would be better if they had clips rather than just snug downs. The snug downs work, but take a lot more time undoing and doing to take such devices out, and then put them back. With snaps, getting to the tri and monopods would be quick and a 'snap'."
4,Perfect fit,This bag was the perfect size. It is not too big and it has plenty of compartments for our camera and accessories.
4,"pretty good, just not great","I bought this to house camera and video equipment. It serves the purpose perfectly. As long as you are dedicating this bag to one set-up, you will love it! However, if you have an idea that this bag could be used to carry several different camera set-ups based on the day, you will be a bit disappointed. The inside compartments CAN be moved around, but the velcro is cumbersome, and too much changing about leaves things looking ragged. So, if you have one camera and a set number of lenses that you always use, this is for you! If you want to use this one bag and change out your cameras and lenses for the particular shoot, it will disappoint."
3,Nice back if you're not leaving,"It's a nice sturdy, thickly padded backpack, at no time do I feel like my gear is in danger of being banged up when I put my bag in the car, which I love.The cloth that's supposed to cover the zipper for the main opening is on the opposite side from most backpacks and doesn't cover the zipper right, so if you're not careful, and decide to use your backpack in the rain, your stuff gets wet. Another thing I don't like about this design is the fact that there are no stops or straps to keep the bag from opening accidentally while you're wearing it. Two snaps would have been nice back there, just in case.I'm currently looking for something to replace this bag. While this is a very nicely padded backpack, I just don't feel comfortable relying on a single unprotected zipper to safeguard my gear."
4,Good camera backpack for the price,"I bought this because everyone talked about how big it was and how it could hold so much stuff... well it does hold a good amount of gear, but it is by no means big. It holds an acceptable amout camera gear and I do like the bag.The negatives for this bag are:1. The zipper does feel cheap. I'm always very cautious with the zippers because I don't want them to break. Never leave the zippers at the top of the bag when carrying around your gear as they feel like they might open on their own and drop out your gear.2. I wish their was some more velcro or a web or something to hold the gear in place. Stuff can easily shift around in there and you have to be careful when opening the bag that stuff doesn't fall out.If you have a little inginuity and are willing to modify the bag yourself then this is the bag for you! It's very inexpensive and seems to be good in every other way. I would buy this bag again knowing that I will need to make a few changes when it arrives."
5,As always Amazon has the best price,This is a nice addition to my arsenal of ever growing camera gears. This will be used for my new Canon XSi and accessories and does accommodate all of them even the lens hoods. Yes I wished it did have Velco to prevent items from falling if you opened it accidentally the wrong way. You can buy the Velco strips to secure the open tops. Again Amazon had the best deal. In my area (Honolulu) the price is almost double!
5,Amazing product!,"Where to start? This product is fantastic! There is so much room to fit almost anything. I have two SLR bodies and three lens and still have room for an iPod, a pair of binoculars, a bunch of accessories, and much more. The design itself is terrific. There are so many different pockets and useful straps for holding objects like a tripod. The padding on the backpack is not the best, but it works! Inside, the padding on the inner perimeter of the backpack is somewhat thin but looks sturdy enough. There is a plentiful amount of dividers which comes in handy at times, and the padding for your back feels so comfortable! Overall, this product has just been a wonder, and I would definitely recommend this to a friend!"
3,Good Backpack Not so good Camera Bag,"It keeps my camera safe and I am usually with my little Girl so I could not go with a shoulder bag. It is a little thick and depending on your gear heavy. It serves its purpose and can be frustrating getting in and out of it. Especially in and out, off and on."
4,Camera backpack,"Great overall design, a lot of room and best of all, adjustable compartments to fit whatever camera or lens you have."
5,Great Bag!,"This bag holds everything! I can put my Canon XS along with 4 lenses as well as the cleaning kit, sd card, my netbook and a ton of other stuff. This bag is great.. I did take the advice of other commenters and I took a black sharpie to the silver canon logo. When I go travelling, this bag is useful because I can have everything with me.. and then some =) I love this bag.. the quality of the bag could have been a bit better but so far it's held up pretty well. I have to agree that the interior could have been designed better. Everytime someone tries to get into my bag (especially customs officers) I have to tell them to open it on its back so my lenses don't fall out. But other than that, I'm a very happy purchaser!"
3,Tough but NOT really tough camera bag,"Tough but not really tough enough for camera bag pack because mine is already broken I used it only for 6 months may be,, I carry a lot of tools like my METZ CT 60 power pack flash beside my camera and one more fill in flash. Now it stay chillin' in my bed room."
3,"OK Concerto, excellent Etudes-Tableaux.","Kissin was a bit too young at the time for this concerto; that said, his tone is ravishing (slightly metallic on this particluar piano, but that's in terms of bells, not anvils). Overall, the playing is technically sound, but one could question the use of pedal here and there, smearing articulation, and at times--no fault of his own-- Kissin is drowning in the swells created by Gergiev. The Etude-Tableaux are excellent; several could actually be considered signature readings of the pieces. Buy this recording for the etudes, and use the concerto for points of comparison with the likes of Cliburn, Duchable (a personal favorite), Ashkenazy and Weissenberg."
1,"Truly, Stunningly Horrible!","I heard this Rach 2 on public radio today, and was awestruck. I waited for twenty minutes in my driveway to hear who could possibly posses this clumsy sense of rhythm, this ability to make even the most graceful transitions sound forced, this manor of hammering awkwardly at the most beautiful left-hand runs ever composed, and a total -- and I mean complete and utter -- lack of dramatic sensibility. The local NPR station sometimes plays recordings of the local community orchestra; perhaps the no-name soloist from last season?... No, I would have remembered a performance as bad as this...Of course I recognized the name of Kissin when I heard it, famous as it is. However, I am not familiar with the rest of his discography for a simple reason; I only buy discs which are acclaimed critically. Yet, modest as Kissin's reputation is among reviewers, this performance truly shocked me. It really was THAT bad."
1,mediocre C-minor,"To put this streight Kissin doesn't understand Rachmaninov's music at all. He makes mistakes high-school students at Moscow conservatoire are tought to avoid at a very early age. I don't mean that my understanding is inevitably right, tastes are different in the end.However some pieces sound so bad, you can't help feeling sorry for the pianist. His rubatos lack elementary taste. His pedal is a disgrace and at times a disaster! In the end amazing second concerto sounds cheap and pitiful.If you want to listen to a beautiful interpitation, get Richter's."
1,Chinese lack of quality!,"What could be a reasonably priced product with ample power suffers from several quality issues. Ingersoll-Rand should be recognized for quality tools throughout their price range. This Chinese manufactured product, however, has a combination of extremely rough surfaces as well as poorly designed and difficult to use controls. The nut at the base of the grip used for supply air also has a sharp edge that presents a hazard to a user's hand. Ingersoll-Rand has manufactured impact wrenches that are far more user friendly. My recommendation, upgrade to a much better model or buy another brand!"
5,To look good is important as well,"It completely met my expectations.It's powerful, it works great and it looks great.The only thing you need to look at is the size of your compressor and the hose.It really needs a lot of air but if the environment is equipped for that it brings a lot of fun."
5,Great earrings!,"These are great earrings-the stones are great quality. I liked these earrings so much that I bought them in 4 other colors. I have purchased them for presents for others, and get compliments all the time."
3,"Not exactly ""Practical""","This is an ancient text. In a modern context the term ""practical"" is laughable. That said, it's a classic text, so there you go."
5,Practical Taoism by Tom Cleary,The culmination of Cleary's work in Taoism and Life. A guide to the Way in today's world.
1,THIS ITEM BY KODAK SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM MARKET,"THIS ITEM SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET PLACE, THIS PAPER STANDS AS A NOT SO GOOD ITEM FROM KODAK.I'M STUCK WITH (TWO) BOXES OF A BAD PRODUCT.I WOULD LOVE TO SENT IT BACK TO KODAK FOR A REFUND. GLOSSY IS THE ONLY PRODUCT TO BUY FOR THE 1400 PRINTER."
5,I give this album 5 academy awards. Including best songs.,"First of all, what I really did is that I borrowed this album from the library. When I listened to the third movement of the sonata no. 1, I started to remember that my clarinet teacher played it to. How fashionable! I was amazed by the clarinet playing and the piano. I would like to thank Richard Stoltzman and Goode for making such a wonderful album."
2,A Performance Lacking in Taste,"In these performances, Richard Stolzman offers us phrasing that is so overdone that it is offensive. While I do not favor the bloodlessly cautious interpretations that are to be found in several other recordings of these works, Stolzman goes tastelessly in the opposite direction.He has a pleasant tone and good intonation, but these are wasted on readings which do Brahms' music a disservice. Richard Goode's work is at a higher level. It is too bad he didn't collaborate with another clarinetist."
2,"Please, please buy the original","I have to agree with Christopher Culver's review - I am disappointed and irritated for having bought this album. Having heard the original ""Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares,"" this one didn't work for me at all. I bought it expecting it to be a more recent, higher quality production. While the recording quality is indeed far superior,the changes in arrangement and pacing of the titles from the original album, and, the additional selections here just don't cut it musically. Do yourself a favor and buy volume 1 of the ""Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares."" It is much more absorbing and lively, despite the poor recording quality from an earlier time."
3,the ladies have done better work,"There is another disc around (perhaps their first) that is so much better. Trying to find it. But the ladies are so wonderfully---Bulgarian, mystical and inviting."
5,"Stunning, instantly-accessible beauty.","Some of the most beautiful, haunting sounds ever made. The first two ""Mysteres Des Voix Bulgares"" albums were very poorly recorded, to the point where it interfered with enjoyment of the music, but this recording is quiet and transparent as crystal.There is still far too little of the vast Bulgarian repertoire available in the West, so it is somewhat a shame that they chose here to re-record several of the same songs from the first two albums. However, it still richly deserves its five stars.If you don't have the first two ""Mystere"" albums (or the out-of-print and surprisingly poor third album), this is certainly the one to start the re-education of your ears -- they will eternally thank you."
4,my western ear is stretched,"I love this recording, and I love this music. I don't have anything to compare this too since I don't own any middle-eastern style music, but as a lover of classical music it is interesting to hear the types of music that existed even before then. These women have beautiful voice, and create sounds you might not believe possible. If you are interested in international choral or vocal works I believe you would really enjoy this."
2,Unrealistic,"I'm an experienced ghostwriter. Let me nip something of Grossman's in the bud right off the bat. His major premise seems to be that you don't have to spend a lot of money on a ghostwriter because all you need to start is a proposal about your book, not the actual book in hand. Then you just send the proposal to agents/publishers and, if it's good enough, bam! you'll get a big advance. Um...no. Unless you're a celebrity or an expert with a HUGE platform, good luck getting a publisher to give you an advance for a sight-unseen work. It's almost irresponsible to suggest that it can happen. Grossman's wrong. I'll give him two stars because there is some practical advice in here, but that's all he's getting until he joins the rest of us in the real world."
1,Extremely boring and forgettable,"This is your typical story of Mings vs. Chings. It tries to be large scale, but way too much time is spent on the story and it really becomes a struggle to sit through. A General of the Mings has been killed and now his family is on the run. Polly Shang Kwan plays the elder sister and Carter Wong helps them out because he was once saved by the General from execution.Polly Kwan has a memorable entrance into the movie but other than a lion dance and the final fight, nothing else stands out. What really made me mad is that Carter Wong doesn't even participate in the final fight.1/5Picture quality from Groundzero is bad but watchable."
4,Un Celentano maturo,"Un bell'album, con idee originali, bei testi e buona musica.Un Celentano maturo, da ascoltare con attenzione.Da segnalare la malinconica ""Marì Marì"". Da acquistare."
4,Not rec'd yet..but soon,Bought for function as well as for looks and decor.Great Friday price of $15.Golda's in Canada sells it for $70....and not in the color I chose..Maine Blue.
4,The death of China's mistletoe supplier opens a can of worms,"China's mistletoe supplier is a surly loner who raises goats in the Texas hills. He is found dead on the side of the road next to his brand new $20,000 truck. There seems to be many more mysteries around this neighborhood other than the identity of the murderer.As usual, Ms. Albert writes a really strong mystery with vivid and colorful characters. There is more than one mystery involved as well as China's worry over the strange behavior of her best friend Ruby. Great book, enjoy!!!"
5,"Fun, But Never Fluffy","As with any of the China Bayles mysteries, ""Mistletoe Man"" provides just enough background on the main character, China, to create a comfort level for someone new to the series.I enjoyed this book as much as I have enjoyed the eight prior mysteries. While I'll agree with another reviewer that it was light on action and heavy on relationship development, this is not a bad thing! Susan Wittig Albert writes of friendships, family ties and other relationships with depth and intricacy. Readers should never fear ""fluff"" when reading her mysteries.The tremendous amount of herbal information in each book would be enough to draw gardening enthusiasts; that the stories centered around the herbs are entertaining, thought-provoking and complex makes this appealing to anyone!"
4,An Enjoyable China!,"I have read all the books in this series, in order, and that's the way I would recommend the series to anyone. I really like China and her friends. They seem like good old friends to me now after nine books. This is a really good example of a ""cozy"". Most of Ms. Albert's books in the series have had a lot more murder and mayhem with people getting shot and killed everywhere. That makes this one quite enjoyable. China can concentrate on solving the mystery, and not trying to dodge killers. I liked this book, but just the same, it is predictable. An astute reader will be able to pick up on Ruby's problem right away and maybe on the murderer too. Still I recommend this series. The characters that people these books are so very real, and I love them all."
4,great gift for dad,"I purchased all three dvds of When It Was A Game for my dad for fathers day. He is a huge baseball fan. I know they came out a while ago but since the content is from baseballs golden age I figured my dad would still like them. And he did. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is I would have rather bought the dvds in a set...that was only available in blueray which my dad doesn't have, so I had to buy each one seperatly. Overall, another good purchase from amazon."
1,When it Was Game 2,"When I received this product, the packaging was correct, the label on the disk was right, but the film on the disk was When it Was a Game 1! I realize that this mistake was not the fault of Amazon, but of the producers of this film. Amazon sent me a replacement, but the results were the same! I gave this review one star because of Amazon's excellent service, but zero stars for the film producer's mistake."
5,Wonderful trip down memory lane.,"This is such a pleasant movie for any fan or baseball who wants to view how the game was played before expansion, PED, and other steriods ruined the game with cheaters such as Bonds, McGuire, Alex Rodriguez, and Clemens to name a few."
4,"It's not a turkey fryer, it's a brewpot!","I just want to point out that you can recycle the oil from these fryers with a small filtering device, so it's not wasted.Second, this is great for those of us who home-brew. It's tough to find an affordable and large pot to boil 5 gallons of liquid safely. Plus, you don't want to do it on the stove, since boil overs are hard to clean up."
1,A whole in the bottom after 1 use,"We used it once and the metal was so thin that it burned right through the bottom. Just a small needle sized hole, but never-the-less, it leaked all over our brand new patio. Had to buy a pressure washer to remove the damage. Pass on this one."
5,Simply the best,"This is the best investment I've ever made: I will never, as long as I live (I'm 15), need to buy another recording of the Brahms 2nd or Appassionata--obviously this is difinitive. So if you want to save money, instead of spending it on five other recordings of the same piece (you know who you are), but this one. Just to go quickly into the App., with seemingly every other artist the big chords in the first movement are just noise(ex. Rubinstein) but with Richter for the first time they make sense(this is a micocosim of whole CD)."
5,The Best Scherzo Ever,This CD is worth the money for the 2nd movement of the Brahms alone. The best 2nd movement I have ever heard. Thank God it is still in print!
5,"Incredible piano playing and a big, big performance.","I remain impressed with the Richter performances which are being re-released. This performance is even more remarkable since the conductor and soloist did not have the opportunity to rehearse. The result is simply the best recording of this work I have ever heard. Richter plays some of the most difficult passages ever written with clarity, ease and power. The orchestra playing is first rate. This is the one to have."
5,2Step,"Vital 2Step combines soulful R&B vocals, driving beats of Drum & Bass and the seductive swing of house. The first US Release mixed by DJ Lee of London's Black Market Records. There is no other cd like this one, its one of a kind. If you really like Drum & Bass and R&B, you will love this cd. Its a nice combination with captivating and intoxicating beats that will keep you mesmerized and dancing! The 15 tracks are a compilation of tracks by Artful Dodger, DJ Zinc, Wookie, Richie Dan, Resevoir Dogs Inc, Y Tribe, Groove Chronicles, Colour girl, Master Stepz, Bini & Martini, Second Portocal, Nadine, T-Tree and Captain T. This is a must have!"
4,For the Newcomers,"This album is a great peek into the strange world of UK Garage. Part R&B and part Techno Break Beat. Fans of producers like Timbaland, Jermaine Dupri, and the Neptunes may be interested to find out where that 'hiccuppy' style of beatmaking originated. Doesn't matter if they won't admit it, one listen at this genre or even it's history will tell the truth.This album starts off with the 'flagship' stars of 2-step himself, Mr. Craig David and Artful Dodger's ""Re-Rewind"". It then journeys into more obscure classics. Definitely alot more interesting than those two step albums where all the tracks are just two-step remixes of American Music.The mixing could be tighter but all in all this album is fun and entertaining. If you like this then I strongly reccomend music by So Solid, Craig David and Artful Dodger."
3,The cover photo is a strong hint.,"This is not music to listen to, at least not when you're sober. The repetition will drive you nuts. However it's ideal as a cutting-edge, pulsating, earthy backdrop to other social activities that some people find more enjoyable after downing certain substances, hopefully all of them legal."
5,"Never thought I'd like this, but....","This book has all the elements that make me avoid something--seemingly pretentious, cute kittens, French, flashy wealth and glamour, and despite all that, it completely pulled me in. Two things made me really appreciate this book, and convinced me to buy it for my 5-year old daughter who was enchanted with it: first, the design/art is really captivating. It has a retro feel, a 1960s futurism to it that I can't take my eyes off. Second, it has more than a shallow use of Hawaiian (particularly for this genre). Well beyond Aloha, with an index in the back. The bold graphic illustrations of the Tikis are terrific. It makes me want to get a couple of copies so I can cut out the pages to hang around my office and put on Ultra-Lounge CDs--a guilty pleasure indeed.The other reviewer appreciated the volume for very different reasons than I did. No guarantee anyone else will like this book, but if either our experiences resonate with you, you might appreciate it as well."
2,Not a book for a beginner,"While Mr. Bennett clearly qualifies as as authority in celestial navigation, this book is not well suited for beginners. The narrative is a bit to succint, forcing the reader to try and and ""fill in the blanks"" in order to understand what the author has stated. Modern publishing makes it easier to present tables and examples with the narrative; however, in this book the tables and examples are at the rear of the book, which makes switching back and forth difficult. The main advantage of this book are the tables. In my opinion this is a good resource book and a celestial navigation reference guide, but not as your first celestial navigation primer."
2,Outdated Charts (2003-2007). It's Now 2012.,"Per Amazon, 2 Stars = ""I don't like it."" I like the book.The power of the book is that it crunches pounds of tables and almanac information into a compact 200 page spiral bound notebook. The cost of compaction is, per the author (and I agree), an acceptable reduction of accuracy. Included also is a brief review of celestial nav basics.However, it is now 2012 and the tables in all versions carried by Amazon are outdated. The Amazon search brings up the oldest (2003) version without including the dates. A non-copyright protected (therefore hassle-free) PDF file version covering 2011-2015 is available at Boat Books Australia [...] (Amazon - please take note!)"
5,Good Resource for Intermediate to Advanced Navigator,Excellent resource if you wish to manually navigate or if you find yourself in a situation which precludes using GPS.
5,Mastered the Art,"Listening to 'Mastered the Art' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats, from Spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and Galaga samples (you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up). 'Mastered the Art' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth. Like any original work of art, 'Mastered the Art' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop, jazz, groove, and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions. Greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece. Now if only he'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection. . ."
2,Limited Utility,"This book is really only useful to those who have newer sergers that chain & coverstitch. There are 2 helpful pages each on stabilizers, thread, & accessories - out of 170+ pages of text. The text is written in a gushing ""golly, gosh, aren't we irreverent & fun"" style. The project instructions are sketchy, more outlines than instructions. In the end it doesn't matter, as the projects themselves are so unattractive & home-made looking I wouldn't ever consider making them. A disappointing waste of money."
2,Glad I waited; I found it on sale for $6.95.,"At $24.95, this book was too expensive. I do not have chain and cover stitch so it was of limited value to me. It was worth $6.95, though."
2,Written by Narcissists,"The giveaway is the introduction on how the two authors met, over sangria. How ridiculously narcissistic. It reads as if it were written by someone with a bottle in one hand and a pen with napkin in the other. It is useless for the beginner who needs step by step photo instruction with description.I'm glad I checked this one out at the library, because its going back."
5,Riveting performance,"This is an amazing DVD. The LSO proves that is is one of the best orchestras, if not THE best orchestra on the planet. Worth the price of the disc for the Rite alone."
3,sammy's back,"though i think this book was kind of farfetched and thrown together, i'm really glad that we finally got to see why sammy and tor moved to ireland, and similarly, why inspired them to move back. i'm also glad this flashback wasn't in diary form. it's so exciting that's sammy's pregnant with twins!hopefully the editors will listen to reader demand, which inspired this book, and reconsider their decision to cancel the series."
4,Great Book,"this was an awesome book to read and i would reccommend it to any horse lover. The only problem that i had with this book was that the author said that the Famous steeplechase horse Red Rum was a stallion, when he was actually a gelding.In the book,Red rum had sired a foal.But since he was actually a gelding,the truth is that Red Rum,could never have sired a foal,since he was fixed."
4,Start at the very beginning,"I was looking for some fitness instruction when going out for an ROTC scholarship in high school and found this book at my local library. I had no real exercise background but wanted something that I could do at home, without much equipment, that would get me in some kind of basic shape for a potential future with the military. I am happy to say that using this book prepared me sufficiently to win the ROTC scholarship (though I ended up accepting a different funding package to get to college) and I've kept up my fitness to this day. It may not work for everyone, but it's a good basic workout that hits most essential areas, and takes body fat percentage into the fitness equation which is so often overlooked."
5,Best book on exercise ever,"I found this book at a library years ago and studied it. When my son took interest in his own exercise program, I recommended it and bought it for him. He likes it too. It's a great book."
2,Less impressive than it looked,"In the photos it looked like there was a glass sphere being held and turned by the water. In reality it is just a molded plastic piece painted gray that the water falls over, and is quite unimpressive to watch.I'm not upset about the purchase but in the future I will pay closer attention to the details of the product."
5,Best pop up book ever!,"This is a beautiful book, with well thought out pop-ups and amazing pictures. The story is very cute. One of my toddler's favorites!"
5,Book Purchase,I bought this book for my pre-school class. The children love it! It is a perfect book to read before nap time.
5,Fabulous,"If you love Charlie and Lola, you will love this. This book definitely lives up to the original story."
5,Lovin it in Florida,My 3 year old daughter loves this book. It is cute and quick and very very funny. She sometimes doesn't like going to bed just like Lola and so she really thinks this book is funny.
4,Great for beginners and fans,"I purchased this for my daughter, who enjoys the television series and other books featuring Charlie and Lola. It's great for beginning readers, since the colorful, cheerful graphics complement the sparse text."
5,Charlie & Lola,"We never get tired of Charlie & Lola! The characters are endearing, the writing is clever, and the illustrations are wonderful! My three year old son asks for this book every night."
2,I would not recommend it,A nice looking stainless steel splatter guard. But it does not keep the oil from splattering all over the stove. Plus it is made in China. Definitely not worth the price.
5,My Favorite Christmas Album,"This is a wonderful album...familiar, yet different enough not to be at all routine. I give it as a gift whenever I can, and all my friends enjoy it, too."
5,Grandfather mentioned,"Everyone should purchase this book.It is a chapter that contains information about the murder of my maternal grandfather, Walter Gunn."
2,do not buy !,"i will never watch this movie again i didn't even watch it all the way through it was horrible ! the effects were bad , the acting was worse please do not buy until you rent it first, i made that mistake."
4,Mirror Mirror on the wall...who's the deadliest of them all!,"This is a story about a possessed mirror, and the power i weilds over a young, low esteemed girl, and it's dealy consequences.Rainbow Harvest is the girl, a sort of Winona Ryder type actress. She plays the part very well. The late Yvonne DeCarlo also stars as an estate seller who tries to help twart the cursed mirror. This was also one of Ricki Paul Goldin's early movies. As usual, he was pretty good as the silly boyfiend of Nikki, the heroine. And playing the part of Rainbow's Mom is the late Karen Black, queen of the B- Movies.Pretty standard story, but it is directed well and moves along at a fast pace. Worth the money because it does what it should : entertains."
3,"Middling fare, but certainly not unenjoyable.","A social teen outcast (played by Winona Ryder look-a-like Rainbow Harvest) discovers a mirror in her room that gives her special powers, which she proceeds to use violently on her taunting classmates. This supernatural horror/thriller takes way too long to really get going, but is pretty entertaining for the last forty or so minutes. Despite a few very silly moments and a baffling ending, there's enough blood, suspense, and nudity to satisfy horror fans looking for a quick fix.** 1/2 out of *****"
1,Terrible machine,"I was using it for venision and the meat would not go through the funnels. It just squeezed out of the sides where the funnels attached to the grinder, or backed up into the feeder, not matter how fine it was ground. In addition, This stuffer had no small funnels for the link-size sausage. Also, it was nearly impossible to get them due to the size requirements.Do yourself a favor and don't consider this at all."
3,Decent lens hood,"Not a bad lens hood. I like the connection to the lens barrel makes it quick to install or remove. A tad flimsy compared to other lens hoods, but unless it takes a fiar impact it should suffice."
4,Expensive,"This lens hood is awfully expensive for a piece of moulded plastic that probably cost no more than a few cents to make. But it fits and it does the job. You really need one, and these guys are the only ones who make it, so what are you going to do?"
2,linhvo,"Beware of this seller, will minus by shipping fee + returned fee even han't open item. And refund take about 15 days."
3,Repaired my Cuisinart SPB7CH,"This part was a perfect fit to replace the broken clutch on my Cuisinart SPB7CH. I probably should have bought two since the Cuisinart design is so cheaply made. Regardless, this did the trick and delayed the expense of a new blender. Replacement will require you to take the blender apart in order to release the remains of the old clutch piece."
5,Spinner,"Small black piece of plastic, with counter clock wise brass threads, worth about 28 cents. Costs six / seven dollars or more. Plus shipping... Ain't America great."
5,Journey of Self into the Path of Love,"This book should be mandartory to read. Chopak walks us through a light that we all have within us but so few of us truly find. A Path of Love is not a religious book nor self help, in my opinion. It is a philosophy that we all have yet many of us tread the earth feeling lost. Love and spirit joining with the centre of our beings...our hearts."
5,DEEPAK GOES DEEP,"Deepak is always inspiring - and backed up by good science and the golden heart. Fascinating and uplifting. I also got a lot out of Harold Klemp's writings on the HU sound - also opening the heart to divine love.Here's a favorite quote from Klemp on the off chance there's an interest:""If life's too hard,try singing HU*. It's a love songto God. Sing it for ten minutes.Sing it quietly in your bedroomso no one will disturb you. Orif you must, sing it silently inside,when you're among people. Thentrust God to give you the answerto help you with your problem.""=\=\=~ From Wisdom of the Heart, Book 2 by Harold Klemp ~(*HU sounds like the word ""hue""; you can simply close your eyesand sing it gently, over and over.)=\=\="
5,Recommended,"This book was an eye-opener. After reading it for the first time, I picked it right back up immediately and read it for a second time.I found it to be a didactic approach to matters of the heart and soul which were pre-conceived to me an un-explainable.Read it before you fall in love again. Recommend it to your loved ones. Thanks Dave for ""lending"" it to me.-Richie Etwaru"
3,Get Gilson if You Really Want to Learn M & E,"Carney presents a very good, if not watered down, collection of cases, essays, and questions on Mergers and Acquisitions. He does insert a lot of his scholarship between the covers however - and he isn't the best M & E mind out there. (But who am I, a Law Student, to make such an assertion).It's relatively short considering the size of the subject covered and gives no primer in basic economics which the Gilson book does. I find that to be a major mistake in an otherwise competent book.If you really want to learn the subject, get Gilson. The only thing that sets this book apart is that it is up to date and still in print."
5,Dexter Freebish...The New King of College Rock!,Dexter Freebish takes over where Train left off with the college rock scene. Starting with their hit Leaving Town and just blowing you away by Song 3 Higher. Definately worth the spins on your cd player. Pick it up today!
1,WORTHLESS,"This movie is, according to every other web site, 88 minutes long. When you view it as an on-demand Amazon Instant Video, they show it to be 52 minutes long. The movie stops abruptly in the middle of a scene, effectively cutting you off from watching the last half hour of the film. DON'T BUY THIS AS A STREAMING VIDEO!!! You'll be disappointed that you can't actually watch the whole thing. As I can only comment on the first 52 minutes, the movie seems good so far...I'll let you know if I ever can watch the rest. The DVD may be the way to go, but since it's produced on-demand, I'm not so sure it won't have the same problem."
1,"If you want scratchy shorts, look no further","These are a cotton/polyester blend which I expected, but damn, the fabric is very scratchy and uncomfortable. I think the label should read ""50% steel wool 50% burlap"" because unless you have skin that's rough and thick like an elephant, I wouldn't recommend them."
5,Love these!,I am a turtle person and when we renovated an entry way my husband surprised me with these for the new bifold doors hiding our washer/dryer. They are very well made and add a nice personal touch to the room! I now want to go around replacing all kinds of knobs around the house with these....
3,Book review,"This was the third book of a trilogy so I had to read it. Unfortunately it was not as easily available as books 1 and 2. Truth be told it wasn't as well written either. Books 1 and 2 of the series were fun, entertaining and hard to put down. This book took days to muddle through. The book was written as if the author just wanted to complete the series and put as much time into tying the characters together as my 12 year old does with his school work!"
5,Enjoyed very much,"This was an enjoyable book with good characters and a interesting story. I liked reading all the books in this series, with this one being the best of the three. Will be looking for more on this author."
3,wish it mounted like other canon hoods.,"i'm not a fan of the ""squeeze to mount"" setup of this hood. i like the other mounting method of ""twist and click"" of other hoods."
