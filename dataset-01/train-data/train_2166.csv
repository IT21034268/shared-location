4,"Movie is a B, 3D effects are B+","I was going to buy this movie, but when I noticed that Comcast was renting it through xfinity I decided to that instead and save some $15.It was a cute movie with a good storyline and avery nice 3D environment. The movie is not as impacting visually as OWLS, but manages to do a good job. Disney movies tend to be very colorful and this one will not disappoint in that respect. This movie tends to be one of the highest rated 3D movies, I think that has to be on how well the movie incorporates the 3D effects without being overwhelming. I personally like and look for movies that have heavy 3D effects, but as we all know those are hard to find, this movie has about 2-4 big pop up effects, but the entire movie plays a very well defined 3D environment.I would consider buying this movie in the future, but maybe after I ran out of tittles to try out. I think it's a good movie to show off your 3D HDTV.I will be looking forward for more Disney 3D movies."
5,Great movie for the family,Excellent story for the whole family. My kids and baby girl enjoy to watch this over and over.Also the video quality and audio quality are good
5,Loved by all!,"This movie is awesome. My 3 year old completely loves it. When he, yes I said he, had surgery he specifically asked for this movie. He loves the character, RYDER! I love the movie as a whole, but I really love the music in it!"
5,Great movie for all ages.,"A truly wonderful movie! The visuals, the music, the story, and the voice actors are spectacular. It doesn't have the emotional depth of a Miyasaki movie but it is a lovely take on the fairytale."
5,This is a classic,This movie is reminiscent of the original Disney classic animations. It was as if Walt and the original crew did this film. Anyone at any age can watch this movie and feel great from watching it.The musical number at the tavern was hilarious. That frying pan as a running gag was priceless.It is a heartwarming story. Everyone who own Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast should also own this film. (I just wish I could say the same about Brave ... what a sad waste of two hours and 30 bucks that film was.)
3,good movie,My daughter loves this movie and I love watching it with her. To bad the shipping Hella sucks it took me about 2 weeks to get it... Well as long as I got it that all that matters :-)
3,cute but weird adoptive mother,"Though I suppose she isn't really adoptive, the Mother Gothel character is emotionally abusive and disturbing. We have some friends adopting a daughter and she will not allow her daughters, biological or adoptive, to watch this. I agree.The storyline is too convoluted and my three year old did not enjoy this movie. The chameleon character is cute and well-written, very child-friendly.If you have nothing better to do, I guess you can rent this. Meh."
5,LOVE this movie!,"Love, love, love this movie. My 5 year old daughter watches it all the time and I never mind watching it with her. Definitely the best Disney movie in a LONG time. The music is fantastic and isn't to scary for little kids. Great movie!"
5,Loved it!!!,"I think Disney came up with the best movie ever! I can't get enough of it. Love it, love it!"
3,I like this movie :D,"It's cute, but not my favorite Disney movie. Bought for me as a gag gift because of my hair, I wouldn't have bought it for myself. :D"
3,Very average for Disney,"Fantastic character animation, mostly due to Pixar, and despite the Menken soundtrack, the songs were really forgettable. I will probably never think of this movie again. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good."
4,Worthwhile,A very sweet and amusing movie. I'd watch it again...especially for the horse.....He was laugh-out-loud funny. A great family film.
2,Apple TV Compatability,"The streaming feature is good, but I cannot play the movie on my Apple TV using the iPad, only through my iMac. This is inconvenient and doesn't make any sence to me. The Apple TV quality of the movie is not HD, another mystery to me."
2,Tangled ? Was it good?,"Actually I had downloaded this video for my granddaughter, but we didn't get a chance to view it when it was taken back. I really don't like Amazon's policy on this. If we rent it, we should have as long as we wish to view it. Very unhappy with this."
2,Missing disk,"The package contains only one disk. that is Blu-ray disk only. The reason why I ordered this combo disks are, I can play the Blu-ray at my home and the regular DVD in my car. Because my daugher loves to watch this movie. When I contacted the seller, they mentioned that it contains only Blu-ray disk in the comments. But I didn't see those comments anywhere. They were failed to show me the comments. I am disappointed whith their service."
4,Tangled,Enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. Looking forward to seeing it again in blu ray.
3,Love animation,Decent remake. Animation is high quality. Not quite a Pixar take but my kids love it. I recommend it at least once.
5,Best Disney Musical since Beauty and the Beast,"I saw this movie in the theater with my best friends 4 year old daughter. I thought it would be just OK but I wanted to see it with my little 4 year old friend. Well, she did love it a lot. And to my surprise so did I. I bought the 3D blu ray and it's the best 3D movie I've seen to date. And it's just a great film. I highly recommend seeing this movie that was not publicized as it deserved. It is really good and I don't think the movie got a fair shake in it's initial release. Watch this movie. You will love it!"
5,Best Disney Movie since Little Mermaid!,"I absolutely loved this movie! I don't understand how the Academy could have overlooked it. It was so much better than Toy Story 3 and the SKG Dragon movie! I am so glad I didn't see this in the theatre, I cried my eyes out for the last 15 or 20 minutes. It was a fun action movie with a wonderful love story. My 14 year old daughter hates Disney princesses, but loved this movie, she's demanded to watch it every day! My husband also loved it. It's a great family movie with wonderful Alan Menken music! I highly recommend it."
5,Suprisingly great movie,"I had heard this was a very funny movie, and it was. It was also beautifully done. What was siprising to me is that it is an ""old school "" Disnery Musical. Yes, the pictures are CGI generated as opposed to hand drawn but it features music on par with say Hercules, which was a pleasent suprise. I'd reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the mid Diseny classics (aladdin, The little Mermaid, etc)."
5,Great Movie,Its a great movie for kids. It is well animated and looks good in 3D. Still hate the singing tho.
5,Frying pans who knew??,My 3 year old fell in love with this movie from the opening scene.... the first viewing I don't think she ever blinked because she was so entranced.... I have lost count as to the number of times she has watched this movie... I couldn't have chosen a better movie with a more appropriate heroine if I had designed the story myself. Thanks So much!
4,Poppy,"Bought the two disc Blu-ray/DVD combo so I could give DVD to grandkids. My wife and I ""previewed"" it last week and decided it would be perfect for the kids to watch. Good entertainment although not great like ""Cars"" (my favorite)."
5,Tangled (Two-Disc Blu-ray/ DVD combo),The movie was very charming and the new type of computer graphics that they used was AWESOME.... It was very moving... in some parts funny and in others made you cry... i would recommend this DVD for everyone of all ages! I enjoy shopping on line at Amazon because the prices are usually cheaper and the service is AWESOME!
4,Another Hit,"I wasn't expecting much, but, as usual, the Disney team knows how to take a flimsy story and flesh out characters with personalities, adventure, humor, romance, a bad guy/gal or 2 and some nail-biting until all is well. We always know there will be a happy ending, it's the ride to that end which is so enjoyable. Go ahead and buy it, your whole family will enjoy!"
5,Tangled 3D-BluRay-DVD-Digital Copy,Wonderful movie and a really nice combo package. Highly recommend this movie to anyone with children and it was a treat to watch as an adult.
5,lovley film,wow i cant believe some one would write that much about a movie... i personally loved the movie and im 22. now i would not recommend it for younger children because they might think its ok to start disobeying Mom and Dad. but the older ones will understand her dilemma. i have watched it twice now and could watch it again...
5,Great movie!!!,"Another wonderfully made movie by Dreamworks. The movie is funny and very entertaining. Enjoyed the characters and the songs were magic. A film for all ages, definitely , will make you smile."
4,great 3D entertainment.,"As usual, with amazon, it was shipped fast. Lots of humour and the 3D in this movie is just great. Disney hit a home run with this movie."
3,Thats some long hair,"Eh, it was ok, lots of cutesy songs. The horse stole the show IMO. I felt this movie was more for girls though much like the princess and the frog."
5,Happiest ever!!!,I'm happier then the last movie I got because I got a used one that skipped 10 mins in. But I returned it and got my money back and got a new one instead.
5,I love this movie!,"This movie is so good and adorable! It's one of my favorites and if you haven't seen it, you should!"
4,great family film,"Tangled is a good film for a family to laugh and make a few memories. :) A few scary scenes with the ""step mom"" but otherwise it's great through and through. Bravo!"
4,"Easy to get tangled in ""Tangled""","Once again, we have a delightfully entertaining movie that appeals to both children and adults. A sure winner for the entire family to be viewed again and again."
5,Best Movie Ever!!!!,"I love this movie. It's my favorite disney movie. Scenes are very bright and clear in blu ray. After getting the DVD, I've watched it over 3 times in the past weekend. Songs are great. Characters are awesome and you've just got to love pascal. :) Storyline is also very original."
5,our favorite disney movie.,"Great music!! A little dark at times for my four year old we had to watch it the first couple of times totally skipping the kidnapping in the beginning and mother knows best scene, but now she loves dancing and singing to the music so much she quickly gets over the couple moments she doesnt like in the movie. As with all Disney movies there is a happy ending."
5,Tangled,Movie was in great condition and arrived in time so I could give it as a present a few days after I ordered it!
5,Great family movie,Great family movie with lots of amazing animation. It also has a lot of humor for kids and adults alike.
5,Terrific,"I took my 10-1/2-year-old son and daughter to see this movie, and we all loved it. The twists on the original plot are smart, funny, and even thought-provoking. The songs, which are glorious, fit seamlessly into the plot. Furthermore, they advance, rather than merely echo, the action. Indeed, when we first saw the movie, we had traveled most of the way home before I realized the movie was a musical. This is a film for all ages."
4,Daughter's Favorite Movie,This is the favorite movie in our 3 1/2 year old's rotation. It's done well and is tolerable for adults to watch with enough humor to keep you interested.
2,CD would not play properly in player,"Put the dvd into my player, the intro played just fine, when the movie started, it would freeze. It continued to freeze throughout the movie. It is not my dvd player because my other dvd's play okay."
2,Not so good,"It had its moments, overall disappointing, good for kids, less so for adults. Summation: Regurgitated Disney Drivel... boring music to boot."
2,No where near hand drawn titles of the past,"Boy I am a sucker. After hearing this was finally a Disney title that equals past efforts I was shocked to find I had to shut it off after 30mins. Four completely boring songs, generic CG animation and story, characters I just didnt care about. Princess and The Frog steam rolls this 20 times over. Apologists like to the pull nostalgia card but I can honestly say we have back stepped greatly since the days of traditional animation or how they dealt with story and songs."
1,Disk skipped right out of the box!,"The movie is great, no problems there. But it went straight from the box to the computer and I even tried it on a DVD player and it skips. Another person in this house had a copy that skipped as well, and I've played plenty of other DVD's on these that did not skip. I'm going to try to get a replacement for the defective disk. I also looked online some people who purchased the DVD from Amazon, Walmart and the Disney Store also had the same problem. :/"
2,Completely forgettable,"Despite the wonderful animation and art direction, this is yet another of Disney's failed attempts to capture the magic of their ""golden age"" of the 1990s. The Lost Princess/Rapunzel is just another ""misunderstood"" girl who's coming of age means rebellion against her parent. This is practically a theme for Disney films of late, perhaps done so they'll be marketable to the so-called spoiled ""tween"" girls who think the the world revolves around them. In any event, this film has the obligatory (and forgetable) musical numbers that fall flat and don't advance the story, but rather are just an interruption of it.Save your money, unless you want to entertain young children with the bright colors and fast-moving action. The story isn't worth the journey through ""Tangled."""
1,received only the blue ray disc.,There was only 1 disc is the package. I didn't realize it until I was ready to give it to my grand daughter for her birthday. So I really haven't seen it. Can I return it?
5,Tangled,Disney has come out with a very nice film. In some parts I really had a good laugh. The movie is not just for kids.
3,Fun Movie,"Fun Movie for whe whole family, a classic turned into a modern fun time. Not a Shrek but definitely worth a watch."
4,Awesome Movie,Great Disney movie that is re-mastered into Blu-ray format. Great combo pack for those that haven't converted to Blu-ray player yet and still have DVD players.
5,wonderful,"This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. It's such a fun, cute, and surprisingly deep movie."
5,Totally Fantastic! Can't wait for it to be released on Blu-ray.,"I've seen this movie three times at the theater, only in 2D so far, and have another viewing scheduled for next weekend. This movie is adorable, so beautiful, the music is fantastic, the humor...delightful. I didn't get a chance to see it in 3D, and wish I still could, as it is hard to find at theaters now. I think this movie is best seen on the big screen to be able to appreciate the absolutely amazing colors, the action and the charm of it. I was hypnotized as I exprienced this adventure with such joy. Rapunzul is so sweet, the horse is hysterical. I adored the scene where the little girls braided Rapunzul's hair. So much hair!!! The syncronized bird's eye view of the dancing was very cool! Go see it, if you can still find it somewhere. You will LOVE it!!!!! And for sure, you should buy it!!"
5,Love it,"Got my daughter this for xmas she is going to love it , I cant wait to give it to her for xmas"
5,Cute story,"My daughter (8) and my wife love this movie. I have never seen it, but they have watched it multiple times."
5,Great value cleaning kit,"Priced like a cheapo kit, but is good quality. What more could one really ask for? Just remember you will need bore and chamber brushes specific to your needs."
2,Good but nothing special,Used this to clean my AK-47 and Glocks the red paint thats supposed to protect the rifling in the barrel from damage comes off pretty easily exposing bare metal and the patch holders are made of a cheap plastic they broke off right at the thread level so I had to dig and turn to get the broken piece out this happened the first time I cleaned my AK barrel pushed a patch thru I had to replace them with brass. This is nothing amazing I thought it would be something nicer than a regular old brass setup but I will be investing in an all brass setup this is not made to last.It does the job however its protective appeal the seller protrays rubbing off so easily makes it just another steel rod with cheap attachments.
3,Watching for coating flaking off.,"Not a bad item, I used it a few times to clean all of my guns after a day of shooting, After about the 5th use i had one of the extensions start to flack off pretty much ruining the reason I bought a coated rod."
5,just like the old days,"so glad i have kids as an excuse to buy the stuff i played with as a kid. these rings are awesome. have had them over a year, and use them all the time. p.s. it totally helped one of my three year old twins to start having the courage to dive down on her own to collect the rings. it totally worked. the twins are four and awesome little swimmers. i think these rings were a huge stepping stone for her confidence of swimming on her own... she was ready, she just didn't know it yet. these rings gave her that extra little boost."
5,Great swimming education tool,"Our daughter's swim class used dive rings, so I searched and found these. Great for playing ""diving"" games (with parent supervision of course) to increase a child's familiarity with being underwater. Even our toddler likes to pull them up from the pool's top step and enjoys holding and dropping them. Good buy for anyone wanting to increase their child's swimming skills."
4,Great swimming toy,"My 4 kids are enjoying throwing these into the deep end of the pool and retrieving them. They are hit & miss with standing upright at the bottom of the pool. I'd say they stand up 50% of the time, however, my kids jump in so quickly after them, that may not be a totally accurate assessment. But I have seen them at the bottom of the pool on their side. I've also seen them upright. Regardless, my kids don't really care which way they land, they just like something to jump in the pool and retrieve. :) They are sturdy and I think they were a good buy."
3,not a 25 degree bag,"I am an old NW camper and needed a bag for several trips this summer. (2007)This is a skimpy 2 pounds of fill bag. Comfortable at night with fleece pants and top at 40 degree nights.I went camping at 3000 feet in June, wore polar fleece to bed, had to put on polar fleece jacket and hat at 1 am. Out side temp 35 degrees.so this is good for very warm weather, RV camping, I was not comfortable and I am 5 '4 150 lbs and I found the bag tight.spend a little more money if you are going to sleep out side, and yes i had a very good air mattrress."
5,mummified,"This sleeping bag is very nice. I am pleased with the comfort, the warmth, the nice features, and the light weight for hiking. I recommend it to anyone that needs a nice bag that doesn't want to spend alot of money on one. A great value."
5,"Warm Bag, great Pack Weight","I recently used this bag for some late-fall / early-winter camping just outside of Lost City, WV. Temperatures bottomed out to just under 30 degrees and dressed in nothing but boxer briefs and a cotton t-shirt, the bag (in conjunction with a Thermarest sleeping pad) kept me quite warm and sleeping like a baby throughout the night. I am 5'8"", 150 lbs and the bag fit great with room to spare. While a little tricky, it was certainly not impossible to jam the bag back into the provided stuff-sack. While I do not have the exact measurements for the bag in its stuff-sack, it's small and will even fit into a day pack with some room to spare. Great product. Recommended."
2,25 degree? No way.,"This bag won't even keep you warm in 40 degree weather. For the price, it's just fine for summer camping. But if you plan on backpacking, it's too big, heavy, and the warmth to size ratio is awful. If you're serious about backcountry camping/backpacking, save your money and get something that'll keep you warm, pack light, and last."
4,Decent,"This is a decent intro sleeping bag. Arrived and works as described, not really a ""stuff bag"" but a solid starter."
5,Good bag,Very fluffy bag but I think a liner is needed for winter camping. Lots of foot room and easy to turn in.
5,Comfy and Warm,"Very warm sleeping bag, I did buy an cotton lining though b/c it is unlined and gets a little sweaty"
2,did not keep me warm,Coleman Taos 25-Degree Mummy Sleeping BagThis bag is light and easy to pack but did not keep me warm in 36 degree temps. Even with fleece pants and shirt over warm pyjamas I was cold.
3,Not a 25 degree bag or meant for tall people.,"I bought this bag and found that it was not long enough for me. I am 6'2"" and could not completely fit in the bag. The ratings for these bags are pretty weak. I have found if you want to camp in 30 degree weather, you need a 0 degree bag. This bag was the same. It was comfortable, but only kept my mid-section warm. The rest of me was pretty cold. I gave this to the wife as she doesn't camp as much and is smaller. She used it once and found that it did not keep her as warm either. I would say that if you are planning on camping in under 40 degree temps, find another bag, otherwise it was ok for the price."
1,Poor quality.,"Zipper failed on second use (tried it out at home), leaving me high (or rather, cold) and dry at the campsite. Do not recommend."
4,Good but cold,"Overall nice bag. Shrinks down pretty small and seems to be very well made. The zippers are nice and the seems are sturdy. Its not really a 25 degree bag though. I'm not a person who is always cold so i figured this bag would work well in 35 degrees. I was very cold! I was in flannel pants and a few long shirts on but was still very cold from the waist down.As for size, its good. i had plenty of room but i am skinny and 5'10"". It was the right length for my body.This bag is good for +40 or people who are always warm."
3,not 25F rated sleeping bag,"This bag is definitely not rated for 25F. I went camping in Lake Tahoe, it was in the 30s and night, and I had to stuff up quite a few layers to keep warm.Relatively small for someone about 5'11"" and up. I really don't like that the foot gets smaller. You really can't move much once you zip it up. The material feels very nice, but if you're looking for something roomy and comfortable, this isn't your bag."
2,Good... but not what i thought!!!,"When I finally got into my bag for the night I found out that it was a tad bit skimmpy. If you have a wide back, this isn't for you. Later that night, it went from 0 deg weather to -15 deg weather, quick. Even though my tent was semi-heated, I found myself shivering, I had to put on some more layers to get comfortable, but unfortunately, it just made me a little wider. So everytime I turned, the whole bag would turn. So if you get this, layer up and lose some body mass, lol. Better for skimmpy... I mean skinny people. Not for the gym rat. ;)"
5,"Clear, easy to read, this one is a winner!","My fourth grade daughter struggles to ""look up"" words in a dictionary. The small print and cluttered format frustrated her to tears. Then we stumbled upon this treasure. The clean typeface, blue colored entry words, and generous use of white space, made this dictionary easy to use. We gave a copy to the LD classroom teacher at her school. The teacher was thrilled - students find this dictionary much more ""user friendly"" than those provide by the school."
5,THE SEX ICON OF THE 80's does it AGAIN!!!!!!,If morrissey was here i would say come here you big sexy stud you.......19 songs!!!! Not only 19 songs but yet annother great compilation of hits by morrissey. I stood in line for half an hour and paid a little more then $30 for this gem. Yet i still dont feel cheated when the same cd is cheaper here. I WOULD GIVE-UP MY GIRLFFRIEND FOR THIS CD. ( she never ment more to me then morrissey anyways -teehee- ) What ARE YOU WAITING FOR??????
1,History of PA Swiss Germans,"The kindle formatting was a mess, making the book difficult to read. This is too bad because the historical detail is impressive and sources appeared to be good. The good news is a genealogist can search easily for specific family names."
2,Great Price That is all.,I purchased this product because of the price and the Bran name. I have already had to replace one side a second time since purchase. AMAZON was great in the warranty process they sent out the part and the shipping was made easy. I was doing an oil change yesterday and saw that the other side in no torn open. The Rubber boots are not holding up on this item and it is lots of work and time to replace them. There fore I rate it at a 2 star for the price only.
5,It's a gasket,"I live in the middle of nowhere and do appeciate being able to purchase something like this from amazon, but considering what this is, a rubber gasket, the shipping costs were outrageous. A gasket doesn't need a padded envelope; wrap it in a single sheet of paper and stick it in a letter size envelope with a .42 stamp for gosh sakes!"
2,Acceptable but not great,Not near the quality of the original Oster sealing ring but acceptable. It is only about 1/3 as thick as the original.
4,Perfect - except shipping costs...,"Only bummer is that shipping costs make this far less of a deal than at first glance (hence my four stars). Other than that, what can I say? Does exactly what was intended, brought to life our 1980's blender - LOL!"
5,"it fits perfectly, and it works as intended","The title says it all. Once again, amazon came through with this difficult to find part, and at a very reasonable price. thanks amazon."
5,endless fun,We have had this kitchen for almost 4 years. We bought it for our first child when she was a little over a year old. We now have 3 kids and it's the one toy that they have never gotten bored with.
3,From Under Pete Shelley's Basement Stairs,"As modern Buzzcocks product continues to appear at the rate of two live albums for every studio job, we here get another bucketload of demos that have presumably been sitting around at Pete Shelley's for years. Some of it's good, e.g. the demo of Boredom and the raging take on I Don't Know What to Do With My Life. Some of it's astonishingly funny in a Max Splodge kind of way: see Mother of Turds. But most of it is alternative versions of songs you already have in better versions. Educational, especially for the evolution of songs like Promises which Steve Diggle sings here making up the words as he goes, but inessential save for the fanatic."
5,Gritty and gripping emotional story from Alexandra Sellers,"Alexandra Sellers' contribution to this anthology is another moving and intense Sons of the Desert story. Hadi al Hajar is a Cup Companion to Prince Omar--readers of this series will recognize what that means--and from the moment he sets eyes on Kate Drummond he's determined to resist the pull. Kate gives as good as she gets, though, on their journey through Barakat looking for a mythical, magical valley. Finally, in a remote mountain inn, they both crack....beautiful and intense. The other two stories also worth reading, Susan Mallery writes a sweet virgin story and Fiona Brand a strong time-slip romance. For those who haven't discovered the Sons of the Desert series yet, this is a pretty good introduction, although the story isn't as quite romantically hot and sexy as Sellers' usual."
1,Got No Charge,"The connection for this charger was too small for the Nokia N75 cellphone, which uses the new smaller Nokia round connection hole. It's a problem I've also had with a Nokia travel charger bought from an authorized retail seller. Maybe Nokia is having some quality control issues. In any event, the seller of this mobile charger provided me with a reasonably prompt refund."
1,"Low Price ? Yes, Original part ? i don't think so.","I bought this part as its Original Nokai part, but I was disappointed. I doubt it's original. When it's connected to my phone on the move, it's barely charges because it disconnects and connects again with each stop.Also it's hard to plug the charger, which it should be smooth.Don't let the low price fool you."
5,Excellent charger,Excellent charger. charges my 6555 very quickly (about 40 min) which is comparable to nokiawall quick charger. Highly recommended
2,Too tight for comfort,"Although the charger has a Nokia label, I expcected better quality and wonder if it is a knockoff. The charger was very tight fit into my car's charger port; so tight that I was concerned about damaging the charger port. I attempted to squeeze the two spring blades a little closer so the fit were not so tight, but one of the blades cracked. Now, however, the charger fits much easier.My next disappointment is the short cord, which barely reaches from the charging port to a tray on the console.Oh, and, yes, it does a great job of charging my phone."
5,Cheaper than knockoffs and fits perfectly and snugly,When I first purchased my N95 I bought a cheap knockoff for twice the price I just paid for the Amazon one. The knockoff would not stay in the phone and would not maintain a consistent charge. Pay less and get a better quality product from the manufacturer of your phone. A great deal. Works fine for my N95 and E71.
1,Junk. Not as depicted.,"The item pictured in the ad is not the same as the one sent. The phone plug will not engage and must be held in manually to charge my E71. 12v end plugs in but is obvious shoddy manufacture and finish, as is the cord. No matter, though, since phone plug renders it useless. Everything about it conveys, ""NOT NOKIA"". Not worth the trouble of sending back or pursuing with Reiko just to recoup ""shipping"" charge. Typical China-made junk. Had exact same plug issue with Radio Shack version, also. Difference there was they didnt have the obvious cheap price/bogus shipping charge scheme. They just sell you the junk and charge a lot to boot."
4,Car charger for Nokia C6-01,"This car charger was delivered in an ""E wireless accessories"" plastic bag from CellularFactory a quick three days after ordering. The invoice reads ""NOK-6101"" and white imprints on the side of black charger read ""6102/5310/E71 NK6102CC"". Although there's no confirmation on the unit indicating that it's actually a DC-4 car charger, the end does go into the phone's power connector rather than the USB port. The Nokia 6102, 5310, and E71 cell phones listed on the unit use lithium-ion batteries similar to my C6-01, versus the car charger ""suitable for Ni-Cd and Ni-Mh batteries"" recently returned to another company. Initial tests indicate that it's working as promised, but it has a RED charging light rather than the green light listed under Product Details."
5,Works fine,"I keep this in my car in my console as a backup, because I usually charge my cell phone in the house. I only had to use it once, but it worked just fine when I needed it. I bought it, because it has a nice tight coil and takes up little room in my console. I previously had a straight cable and it was too messy in the car."
3,cost affective,can't complain. it was cheap and it worked :) it outlived the phone i had so that's always a plus
3,Product was ok however,The phone car charger is fine. The customer service is not so good. Shipping was very slow arrived after promise by date which made it late for a gift. Answering email was also slow. I would by this product again but I would NOT buy from this company.
3,I still use it,I had to push down hard for it to go into my car's charger port and it takes a longer time to charge my phone.
5,Nokia DC-4 Mobile Charger Rocks!,I bought this charger for my Nokia BH-900 Bluetooth Headset. It does an outstanding job on over the road trips when quick charging is a must.
3,It works okay.,"The charger is okay. It is built sturdy and I had no problems with it. However, it doesn't seem to charge my phone very quickly. It takes almost double the amount of time as the home plug-in charger."
1,Never received it.,"I never received it from the vendor. USPS showed it was delivered, but I never got it. I contacted Vendor, but they haven't responded."
2,Use a generic charger instead,"The barrel connector is too loose to fit securely in any Nokia phone and constantly falls out, and the cord is absurdly short.Save money and frustration, buy an aftermarket charger instead."
3,Easy to learn but lean on content...,"DDC's Macromedia Fireworks is great if you have a limited background in graphics. I teach High School Technology and use the DDC books for various subjects. My biggest complaint about this book is that the lessons are pretty lean. I have a hard time keeping my students busy for 48 minutes with the length of each lesson. I also think that the book could have been a little more creatively done. I wouldn't necessarily call the lessons boring, but they definitely aren't very enticing for the average high school student. Overall I'd say the book is a good resource for the average beginner to learn Macromedia Fireworks, but it could have been so much more!!"
5,Insightful and Entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I read it in one sitting. When one story was completed I couldn't wait to read the next one and before I knew it, I had finished the book. I thought it showed you from an insider's view how rewarding and anxiety filled this type of profession could be. It was at times both funny and frightening. I highly recomend this book to anyone whoever thought of being an escort or even using an escort."
4,Disturbing yet fascinating....,"Readers looking for a j/o book or a collection of erotica about hustlers would do well to look elsewhere: that's not what this book is about. But if you're interested in what *really* goes on in the world of male escorts, this is definitely a must-read! Don't expect it to be all sweetness and light, either: you get the rough with the smooth here. I *am* looking forward to the publication of Aaron's next book, too!"
1,High-school level drivel,"This is the classic example of lots of hype and little substance. The subject is treated superficially and, although somewhat interesting from a homoerotic perspective, it never goes anywhere, except around and around the author's own self-centered world."
5,A Delightful Read!,"Since I first picked up Aaron's book almost a year ago I have re-read it on numerous occasions. His book is a fast and funny read that will brighten up your day. Suburban Hustler is written almost like a diary with a different story each chapter. Although some of the tales are startling, Aaron keeps the book on a comical note. I have passed his book along to all my close friends and they too have found his life, and book, amusing."
5,Deliciously appetizing!!!,"I really love this book. If you only read one book a year, this is the book to read."

1,Wonderbread and Nonalcoholic Beer,"With this book, Aaron Lawrence manages to turn a sizzling subject into something as yawn-inducingly dull as...his nom de plume. In ""Suburban Hustler,"" the emphasis is decidedly on ""suburban."" Anyone hoping for anything edgy, weird, outrageous or even vaguely original will be sorely disappointed. If male prostitution were available in a New Jersey strip mall store called ""Hustlers 'n Stuff,"" it would be this book."
2,you get what you pay for......?,"hey....i gotta go with the review by ecker....and then some...this bag is not padded at all.it will get the guitar from here to there.the pocket is same as any other,but inside material is like a thin peice of felt,easy to tear....your not gonna get a full scale guitar in this,lengthwise,and the width could hold a les paul body style,but i doubt any other.the material of the bag feels like rough denim,in,and out.im gonna use this bag as an excuse to get a crummy guitar to match...it will scratch your guitar.......the only decent points i see,are the shoulder straps,and prompt delivery,it came a day and a half after order.....yes,its probably worth the $8 spent,but the shipping is just as much.so your not saving any money at all.ive gotten $15 gig bags that were sold locally,and they were padded.i was just being lazy,so i suggest forgo the convenience of it coming to your door,and head to a shop....i must say very impressive delivery though.."
4,Captivated,"I love a ""good read"" and consider CAPTIVE AUDIENCE to be one of the most enjoyable books I've come across lately. I found the author's characters to be believable, their personalities, actions and reactions just as interesting and varied as ""real world"" people. Mr. Hatfield's use of subtle humor and puns is an appreciated pleasure also.He gave me enough information to ""see"" the enviroment he has created without going overboard with techno jargon, something I do appreciate.Any book that can keep my mind busy enough to ignore a hurricane raging outside has got to have something going for it! A good yarn overall and I look forward to his next efforts."
5,Polish Language,This book was informative but also included several requests in polish that can be copied and used by people who do not know how to write in Polish.This book also gave places that had Polish information. Excellent book for People who need information on How to write requests for information in Polish. Requests for information to Poland ate more likely to be answered if written In Polish.
2,Good Idea - Just Not Effective,"I have been using spring clothepins for years to keep my pant legs out of my bicycle chain/sprockets. I decided to try real bicycle clips and bought these - as Quilter's Clips since they are the same product at a lowr price. They are too loose and tend to slip down even when I turn the pant legs up over them from the bottom. After chewing up a good pair of trousers, I went back to clothespins. I am looking for something similar to the clothespins, but with less ""tail"" hanging down. A clamshell style clip would be ideal, holding the pant leg away from the chain while allowing it to move up and down with normal pedaling action."
3,Late.,Although the game is good I did not like the length of time that it got here. It was 4 days late. Game is awesome.
2,this game...,"this game kinda blows. There must be like six songs that play throughout the entire game and none of them are good. Gameplay is kinda weak, but I'm not really into that whole fast and furious crap. I didn't keep this one for long."
2,Snoop dog destroyed the doors,"Some people did not like the free roaming enviornments, I did,and Some people did not like the soundtrack, I did not.I wish I waited to buy the game when the price goes down, but Iwas a fool.I think this series has a lot of potential but I would like tosee custom soundtracks, more diverse visuals, and better presentation in the next installment.I liked the better learning curve, and they had better customization.I suggest a rental before you buy."
5,the bomd,i have this game already cause my dad is the creater and i think it is the best game ever you know those new added races the three new types guess what my idea o yeah
4,Awesome and fast!,"The shipping was very fast, and the game came in great condition, it looked like new. The only downfall, is that I didn't receive the user manual, or the gaming book. But overall, great everything."
5,"Although its dated, its still fun.","Need for Speed Underground 2 is still a great game after all these years. I still prefer to play this game over newer NFS games on the 360. Vehicle customization surpasses other NFS games, the option to fine tune your vehicle, even change your lights to HIDs? What elese could you ask for? Game runs a bit choppy on the 360, but does run better than I remember. This cult hit is a must have for your NFS collection!"
4,My Truth Lies In The Ruins,"My reason for purchasing this book was that I believe I am a descendant of William le Hardi Douglas, the main character in this book. I wanted to find out more about him, and I have certainly done that. It was a fascinating book, especially his love for his wife, Eleanora of Lovaine. A wonderful way to learn more of Scottish History.I did feel a little irritated at times, it should have been proof read properly before being printed. Several spelling errors, I am not meaning words in the glossary, which was very helpful. Sometimes words were repeated in sentences when they should not have been.Apart from that, it was an enjoyable book, which gave a remarkable insight into the life of William le Hardi Douglas."
3,Light and easy to steer BUT folding requires a lot of practice,"Positives: Trendy look, compact, light, easy to place on/remove child from the seat and very, very easy to steer. My 1 year old daughter liked it immediately as she found it easy to climb in and out of it. Seems like she felt very free and comfortable sitting on it. Smooth ride for baby - smooth pushing for mother.Negatives: Folding requires a lot of practice - definitely not a ""One hand fold in less than 5 seconds"" (at least not yet). Manual is poorly made. Seat and back padding are disappointing (padding looks better in the picture than in real life) - especially the padding for the back support. ""Reclining"" is a very, very limited. Fabric is ok. I got the Terra Cota color. I wish I had gotten the black one (Surfer) as the grey is very unappealing (again, it looks better in the picture). Handle feels a bit wobbly."
5,Wonderful!,I love this stroller. It is so lightweight and it folds up so nicely. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Well organized and informative book!,"This mutual fund book was one of the best I have read yet. As a young professional this guide is geared towards the investor who has a long-term goal, for me its a comfortable retirement. I like the way that Chand only selects the best funds that have consistent above-average performance, long manager tenure, low risk, low fees and wide availablilty. Great Buy!"
4,finally a good platformer for xbox,"this is a great game there are about 20 boomerangs you can use. my favorite is the kaboomerang. you can drive around in helicopters, subs, a truck type thing, and go karts. you can also use mechs. this game is so fun. i played this game for 25 hours total. it's only flaw is that killing lizards is way too easy."
1,DUMB,I didn't really enjoy this game. Its too confusing and the story line is stupid. Trust me don't even spend your money on this game.
5,WOW!!,This is really value for money! It's heavy and the sounds it makes are incredible. I bought this for my husband to run aroud our house on Christmas eve pretending to be Santa's sleigh. It was really loud but beautiful. The sounds are so lovely! I'm really happy I bought this and my son's eyes popped out of his head!!Thanks for such a fantastic quality product!!!
3,decent,"I liked that these vitamins were relatively inexpensive, contained coQ10, and lutein, (new fad things I guess, but I wanted to try). But I wish they made them iron-free. I was recently tested for iron and was told I was at the high end of normal. I guess not all women need to take their daily iron!Also, because this product contains iron, it is low in calcium and magnesium (I think calcium blocks the absorption of iron, or vice-versa, and calcium and magensium are absorbed better if taken in a certain ratio to each other).People with thyroid problems may want to avoid this product as it contains iodine.It is also low in biotin. I'm not sure if this is an easy nutrient to get otherwise?Rainbow Light makes a multi which does NOT contain iron, PABA, or iodine, for those who shouldn't take them. I have recently ordered this and will see how goes."
4,"Marvin, Marvin, Marvin",Great entertainment for Marvin Gaye fans. His music is timeless and very enjoyable and has such memories if you are from that particular time era. He was such an interesting troubled soul.
2,just awful,marvin gaye the man this dvd is sad i own other live at the montreux concert and this has to be the worst one yet.dont waste your time or money on this dvd just awful.
1,Ignorance is dangerous,"After finding that my family is of a Jewish lineage, I started celebrating the feasts. Not long ago, I was referred to this book by a family member that has taken issue with me celebrating the feasts.I was unable to finish it, as it reminded me of the hate filled speeches of Stalin and Hitler that I heard in history class. Works like this send up red flags in my mind. Knowing that, if these works become popular, they lead to hate, and hate always leads to murder.If you want to know more about what Messianics believe, call up a local Rabbi, or read Restoration: Returning the Torah of God to the Disciples of Jesus ByD. Thomas Lancaster.Remember to be loving, and not hateful or disrespectful."
5,THE BOOK THAT MESSIANIC LEADERS DON'T WANT YOU TO READ,I have been involved in the Messianic movement and an active member of a Messianic congregation for more than 20 years. Stan Telchin's critique of the movement is both true and accurate. This is the book that many leaders of the Messianic movement will not want you to read. I would encourage all Messianic Jews to seriously consider the issues voiced in this important book.
4,"Helpful, irenic critique","His conclusion: ""Messianic Judaism and Messianic synagogues have no biblical, theological, historical or pragmatic justification."" (p. 25). Telchin knows that the modern Messianic movement is more than just Christianity contextualized for ethnic Jews. Their desire to be a '4th branch of Judaism"" is insulting to both Judaism and Christianity.Telchin is no theologian, but he has a very interesting story to tell.His requisite chapter on antiSemiticism includes some heart-breaking sound bites from John Chrysostom."
3,House Churches or Cell Churches?,"While it is nice to see that there are those in the instutionalized churches that see the need for reformation, I see a greater need in restoration. The modern Americanized church has become so filled with business ethics and principles that we have missed the clear New Testament teaching on servant leadership, authority, and the eternal purpose of the Church.This book will offer you great insights into the cell movement. I would highly recommend this book if you are curious about how cell churches operate. If you are apart of a cell church and are still struggling with the clergy/laity system of most American churches (including cell groups) than I would encourage you to check out Frank Viola's book ""Rethinking The Wineskins"" (...).The message in this book is clear, the church needs to change the world instead of the world changing the church. We must seek to return to a biblical model and pattern for the Church."
5,One of a Kind,I am a definite fan of this outstanding book. It approaches the problem of co-dependency in a unique and theraputic way by asking questions that co-dependents would ask and explaining how their feelings were affected. It hits many things right on the head. It is written so that a person who is co-dependent can understand why their problem exists and how to deal with it. I loved it. I reach for it many times over.
1,America what is not wrong,"In this book Barlett and Steele paint a bleak outlook for the dwindling middle class. Due to government manipulating and corporations leaving America the middle class will soon die out. Writen from one-side of the issue and concetrating on individuals the book does not give an acurate portrail of life in America. The myopic view of this book looks past all the new jobs being created in other feilds as manufacturing jobs move away. Also overlooked is the freedom in the system, who wants to give up their rights so things can be more fair."
4,The Debate Continues,"The issue of to landscape or not to landscape has been argued long and hard since this calendar first came out. Personally, I like the landscape version as I don't write on my calendar, I just use it to reference the date. Perhaps they should release two versions of the calendar and then we can debate ""letterbox versus fullscreen"" to our little trekkie heart's content. As always it's the artwork that keeps me buying this calendar no matter what the format. The beautifully rendered pictures are so much more fascinating than a calendar filled with frames cut from the TV shows or movies. I would have rated it five stars, but Simon and Schuster has cancelled the book that they have been promising in the last two versions of the calendar, so I'm a little peeved at them."
5,This was one of my favorite books as a child.,"Growing up on the coast of Maine, I had the opportunity to meet and know Mr. Winterfeld. My first exposure to him was when he came to my fourth grade class to read ""Stargirl"" to us. I didn't know how lucky I was at the time, but as I matured and spoke with Mr. Winterfeld more often, I realized just how special this man was. I remember being saddened when he passed away, and when I began purchasing his books for the little people in my life, I remember that he passed away owing me a chess game. <smile> ""Timpetill"" held quite a fantasy for me - an entire population of town's children, left by frustrated parents, to deal with their problems and behaviors by themselves. The town's children dividing into two factions, and how and when the parents decide to return. I had often though as a child what that might have been like, small town Maine and no parents to govern us. I highly recommend this book for the younger person in your life."
5,MAGNIFYING SAFETY GLASSES,"THESE MAGNIFYING SAFETY GLASSES ARE EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND IMPROVE MY VISION WHILE DOING ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE SAFETY GLASSES."
1,Fogging renders them useless,"For the past 7 or so years I have bought this product. I wear them out by carelessly scratching the lenses, breaking them - which is all my fault. They were the only/best full lens magnifier I could find. Worked great for old eyes. HOWEVER, they CHANGED them. The newer ones fog up terribly if you are susceptible to that. I perspire a lot - and if the weather is even slightly humid, my eyebrows get damp, the glasses fog up, and I am blind. I've tried defogging sprays - not much good. Instead of fogging up in 15 seconds, they then fog up in 30. I will never buy another pair. They render me effectively blind. Gotta find another solution .... So sad. Was such a terrific product."
4,mag safety glasses,"I have used the older version, and now the newer ones. The older ones were clunky, but did not fog up. The new ones fog up whenever I exert myself, such as hanging up side down in an anchor locker in order to tighten a nut. I have tried using anti-fogging stuff with moderate success. I am stuck with these, as no one else seems to make a full lense safety reader."
5,Great lizard! Very realisitic!,My daughter loves reptiles and collects anything related to them but they must be realistic for her to enjoy them. This is totally awesome and would fool anyone who wasn't looking closely for breathing! It is sturdy and durable and she will get a lot of enjoyment from this collectible.
4,The Best Romance I've Read All Year,"Talk about hooking the reader in the first sentence. ""He was dead. Really deeply, profoundly dead. And she had killed him.""It just gets better after that. Most romances nowadays stink, but this one was a pleasant interlude. I was especially surprised to have enjoyed this book because it didn't have any sex scenes--a little of which I like.I'll be reading more by Amanda McCabe. But maybe she could put in a few short sex scenes now and then......"
4,Venice charms.,"After seeing her dead fiancé's body on the floor, Lady Elizabeth Everdean had gone off to Venice to live her life as Elizabeth Cheswood, a painter who wishes nothing more than to perfect her art. Nicholas Hollingsworth would like to bring Elizabeth back to London, but he, too, finds that Venice has worked its magic on her and for him. Can they live a full and happy life together? Amanda McCabe's blend of comedy and intrigue is a very intricate one, well balanced with the additional enrichment of an Italian backdrop. The vivid characterizations and descriptions make Venice come alive for the reader, and one can't help but laugh at reading it. A very enjoyable read."
5,A Great Read!,"A Death in The Hamptons is a ribald yet poignant drama starring a cast of characters seemingly cut from the recent pages of today's tabloids and set in one of the most glamorous resort destinations in America.From a big name movie star (guess who????) who figures into the murder of another actor, to the sniping self-centered gossip columnist (hmmm, I wonder.....), the book is filled with a cornicopia of personalities which are so close to the truth it is chilling.I promise you it will not disappoint even the toughest skinned readers.The book moves at a fast pace through to a taught climax and death struggle on the high seas where good and evil play each other out amid the swells and sharks.A Death in the Hamptons is brash, bold and unforgiving in style, while retaining a genuineness and sensitivity that is truly unique. Matt Bloom is a major talent whose star is on the rise."
1,A Death In Babylon,"Once again, this isn't the Hamptons -Mr. Bloom, who I met at a recent reading and book signing at East Hampton's BookHampton admits that he intended the novel to be more ""satirical black comedy than mystery."" While those were reassuring words, the publishers intentionally didn't market this book as a ""SpoofHampton"" novel. So the reader is left lingering somewhere in between, as the dialogue is way too corny and amateurish to support a serious murder mystery plot, yet not in any way humorous enough to be touted as satire.To the folks that know nothing about the Hamptons but what they read in the tabloids or see in self-proclaimed Hamptons documentaries, it's embarrassing. The message is loud and clear: Once again, we live amongst a superficial backdrop dominated by the self-indulgent, unscrupulous and morally bankrupt rich&#65533;.leaving any reader familiar with the ""real Hamptons"" feeling cheated and desperately in need of a shower."
4,Nice unit,"I bought this primarily because of its color. I like its stand that gives it a stable place to sit. The photos make it look cordless, but it is not which suits me fine. It has worked well the few times I have used it. The beaters have really deep anchors and do not eject easily. Actually, they are a pain to eject. However, that is fairly minor since I generally only do that once per use. Maybe they will get easier over time. The speed control feels a bit pointed to eject the beaters and it hurts my thumb to press it so hard. It has worked like a champ in beating cakes and cookie batter for me. The ejection problem would not cause me to not purchase it again, but it did rank it down one star."
2,Works but Bad Design,"This mixer works - I've had it about 2 years now.Negatives: The difference between the lowest and highest speeds is very narrow - sometimes I need a much slower speed to start. The biggest negative is the beater ejection. Horrible! Very difficult and it still hasn't gotten any easier over the two + years I've used it - very bad design. Another thing is that the beaters have started to rust - I do put them in the dishwasher.Positives: The motor has held up fine, the cord is a nice length and the unit wipes clean easily after use.Would not buy again."
2,No SLOW for this baby!,"The mixer itself is great, as in efficient if you work for the SPEED channel. There is no slow speed. Even #1 is faster than the BMW 328I. Use a big, BIG, bowl or you'll be wearing whatever you are mixing. Great for mashing potatoes or cauliflower (I'm vegan) and super for batters that DO NOT need to stay lumpy or airy (pancakes and brownies). I've had to purchase an additional hand mixer from a thrift store to get the slower speeds I need for not wearing my culinary creations. But hey, on the stand, it looks like a very cute robot."
2,No low speed! Looks nice.,"As another reviewer has also said, it should really be emphasized to anyone considering this product that the lowest setting of ""1"" is pretty darn fast. Like the contents of your bowl flying all over the place fast... really annoying. Even if I use an extra large bowl, its still a problem.For being a simple mixer, it's quite disappointing to find that it is so flawed. I would think any product tester would have immediately reacted to trying to use this mixer and exclamed, ""we can't ship that, there isn't a low speed"". But I suppose the marketers came in and said, ""oh, but we can, we'll just say it has 6 speeds and the consumers will have to believe that one of those 6 must be slow"".And the sad part is, the marketers got me this time... Hopefully they won't get you... and mine is going to the donation bin..."
4,Just one complaint,"I really like this mixer. It's attractive, compact and takes up little room on my counter, powerful, and seems like it will be long lasting. However, the beaters are rather difficult to eject. I'm used to a seperate eject button and having the beaters pop out, however with this one, you have to pull them out. I don't use a mixer all that often tho, so I can live with it since I like the other features."
4,Great Little Mixer,"This is a very good mixer, especially for the price. I read many reviews before buying this, and the only minor problem that I encountered while using was the slow speed isn't slow enough, but not a deal breaker. The biggest complaint that I read was about the beaters being hard to pull out..WRONG simply push the speed control while in the ""off"" position and the beaters eject themselves. I don't know why so many people had a problem with this. There is even a symbol by the speed control with the beater emblem indicating this. The mixer has a nice balance to it and my hand never felt tired of holding it plus it has a turbo boost button! I highly recommend this mixer."
2,"No Low Setting, so Batter Splatters","This mixer is super-cute, and I had moderate expectations. I just wanted a small hand mixed for jobs that don't require my industrial Kitchen-Aid mixer. The problem is that it does a lousy job on small jobs. It has no low speed, and all the higher speeds are about the same. I wish I had used it within the return window so I could have returned it and gotten something else. It's really impractical unless you enjoy cleaning up batter splatter all over the kitchen."
2,Returned it unfortunately - too hard to eject beaters,"Within 5 minutes after opening, we decided we had to return it. The push button to eject the beaters was just too difficult .So we never used it, but the unit did feel very sturdy and well built."
2,Red Heritage Sunbeam Hand Mixer,"Don't buy this mixer, unless you like cleaning up your entire kitchen after you are through using it. This mixer workmanship is great. The color could not be better. I do not use the stand so I cannot comment on it. The problem is the LOW speed is not low enough. Think medium to high. It slings whatever you are trying to mix all over the walls, the coffee maker, and you. I have used it to make mashed potatoes, cakes, and icing. I have tried smaller bowls and larger bowls. It is always the same- a mess."
1,Very disappointed,Grizzly H5892 Diamond Dresser 3/4 CaratStore purchased @ Gizzly Pa location. Diamond come out of it's mount on first use.
4,review,Great book with lots of good information. This book is my textbook for some military warfare classes I am taking at college. It has lost of information and is easy to understand.
1,JiM CaRrEy,"I thought the book was very interesting, but it could of been better. The author could of explainedhis life a little better. If the book was explained more with humor it would of been better because it is more likley for a child to read the book then a adult. Over all the book was good and I learned a lot about Jim."
5,Great way to learn Project quickly,"I took a Project course through work years ago, but didn't end up using Project on the job. Now they want me to start using Project at my new job. I didn't want to slog through a lot of text, so I bought this step-by-step visual book. Now all my Project skills are coming back to me. A great way to quickly review Project or learn it for the first time."
2,Ok game but nothing to write home about,"Was expecting a very good game but it is an ok game,it is better shooters out there with better stories(Black Ops-SR1-3 and etc)"
1,3hr game not my cup of tea,"I bought this the same time I bought Hard Boiled. And Like the movie I thought it had too much and way too much action no story what so ever. This game is just like that but it has horrid voice acting I've every seen and Heard.The only good thing about this game you play one of my fav actors Chow-Yun-Fat. But that's about it. If you had Max Payne and this next to each other, Max Payne is way more better.I strongly recommend you don't buy this game along with The Sum of All Fears. Stranglehold will not make an imprint in my book.Yak!"
4,THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX,"At the risk of projecting my wishes and hopes onto others I highly recommend that you read this book. Reading it in its entirety with an open mind you will be able to explore the reasons why even though the world pines so for peace, understanding, harmony, community, and love, it more often than not ends up with frustration, conflict, and war. Make sure you take off any institutional or establishment blinders you may be wearing because the author spares no vested interest in his assessment of the human condition. That being said, he also explores the close connection between our minds and the institutions and establishment that have been created and perpetuated, and offers a promising route to a more humane world. His arguments are compelling. A very good, but challenging read."
1,Don't waste your time,"Butler identifies a number of valid issues inherent in society, institutions and bureaucracies and he seems to have Libertarian leanings but he does not offer one legitimate piece of advice about how to make the necessary changes to the issues he presents. His main theme to solve the issues is a childish wish that all people will learn to disenfranchise themselves from institutions and become one with their fellow man, which is his solution to everything. This book was singularly the biggest waste of my time."
1,Another Head-in-the -sand Book,"I don't know why these liberal moonbats keep writing these kind of ""If no one came, there would be no wars"" rants. These left wing types must get use to young bright eyes looking up to them in their protected classrooms and various ""safe"" speaking engagements and actually start thinking that they have the answers. Forget that history is full of violence, and that many evil idealogues started out by telling the ""people"" that peace would prevail if only they would follow that leader. Hundreds of millions have died following such leaders. Be very leary of snake oil salesmen like this author. He has no truths and his advice is dangerous."
2,Poor recording,"Buying Masur (for me at least) has always been hit or miss. Take, for example, his recording of the Dvorak 8th and the Janácek Sinfonietta - an amazing performance of both of these works. Large brass sounds, responsive playing, interesting, well thought-out interpretations. His recordings of the Beethoven overtures for Phillips are equally thrilling. On the other hand, take his recording of the Beethoven 5th. It seems like a different conductor and orchestra than in the Dvorak/Janácek performance. Here we find a bored orchestra playing a concert staple with no energy, no emotion, no nothing. That is what you will find here in this recording of Frank's only symphony. The energy of the piece is totally destroyed and we are left with a mediocre performance of this great romantic work. Look elsewhere."
1,The fall of rap continues,"Untill now Eminem has been a solid artist offering good albums and even a good film. But what happend? After his 3 tracks on the 8 mile soundtrack (which are amongst his best) I thought this could be his best album yet.I was horrified to see I was wrong, not only was I wrong I was completely off target. Everysong on here lacks any real energy and felling and he sounds bored. Songs such as Puke and Rainman are terrible I say leave the funny stuff to Weird Al. And for the serious tracks, they lack any feel. Like toy soldiers is great for the first 2 or 3 listens then you just dont want to know it.Eminem surrounding himself with artists such as Bizzare and 50 Cent has obviously hurt his career, his once rebelious rap music has turned into mainstream pop and I say to eminem, Game over."
2,"yawn.....zzzzzzzzzz.................yada, yada, yada........","Nothing impressed me as far as the sample clips go. Nothing caught my ear. Rather boring, dull, and dry. None of the songs seemed to have much creativity involved either. I like his earlier albums better than this one. Is it Slim Shady or Dim Shady, I forget?Aloha"
1,more crap for the masses,"eat it up, if i take a dump on a compact disc, will you buy that to? same thing."
1,Sounds like EM put together a BAD MIXTAPE,you wouldn't want to listen to any song more than once...whole album one disappointing chuckle...and I AM AN EMINEM FAN...BUT DONT BUY THIS ALBUM...dont alow em to go PLATIUM off this trash...MAKE EM STEP HIS GAME UP FOR THE NEXT...this is wasted plastic....I THINK EMINEM RAN OUT OF IDEAS...I think he should go LIVE IN THE CONGO for 6 months or so THEN COME BACK AND DO SOME POSITIVE RAP...lol
2,Lost Himself,"This album is probably the biggest dissappointment in rap history. after playing his first three albums nonstop since i got them, i of course ran out and got this one on the first day. this album is straight up bad. not one song on this whole cd would have made it on any of his other 3. this album ranks right up there with ""Infinite"" which he put out before the slim shady lp. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM, IT IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER. look, eminem can be called one of the greatest rappers of all times, but this album does not even rate as mediocre. nobody i have talked to likes this album. he needs to go back to what made him successful."
4,He's Back,"If this was any other artist besides Eminem, it would be automatic 5 stars. But the best rapper of our time has a lot to live up to. The beats from Dre are some of the best he's ever produced. And Em's skills have never been better. Songs like ""Evil Deeds"" have amazing lyrical complexity. Overall, this is his most well-rounded album. Slim Shady is present a lot, as is the mature Marshall Mathers of the Eminem Show. The only problem is that we've heard a lot of the subject matter before. Understandable, since he has ""touched on everything except little boys."" Great album, but not as revolutionary as the Marshall Mathers LP. I guess it takes more to shock the world these days."
3,shoulda been better,"The main thing that harmed this album was the fact that kept singing in a whiny, annoying voice on choruses (Evil Deeds,Puke,Mockingbird).Fans told him he could sing when emitting feedback from The Eminem Show's Halie Songs. Plus there is no typical Eminem anger driven songs like Cleanin' Out My Closet, Kim or even Lose Yourself. His bouncy side is only displayed on last track Encore. Em's humour songs are no longer funny but just stupid and wack. Shoulda of been a lot better"
3,slightly generic,"this album is aiight but eminem produces half the songs, and he really shouldnt have coz his beats suck. on the upside there are some great personal songs and some funny ones and dr dre produces the most beats he has for a shady joint (8), just lose it is prolly the worst dre beat(second only to gwen stefanis rich girl). pleez eminem dont quit even when youre coasting with an average album like this its still better than a lot of other rappers."
3,A more Mature Shady,This cd may not be the best of the year or anything but i really like it compared to other Eminem LPs.Eminem shows a more mature side to him(on some songs)and it makes me respect Eminem more then i have before.Of course he has his immature songs that are designed to make ppl laugh but u gotta expect that from Eminem.Anyway this is still a decent cd probably worth 3.5 stars.
1,Proof That America Is Culturally Bankrupt,THIS is the best selling cd in this country? The majority is usually wrong....
1,Lousy,There are a lot of misfits out there who are like lemmings jumping off a cliff for this disgusting excuse for a musician.
3,"I'm not a kid, and I'm not happy.","I keep seeing all these bad reviews and I keep wondering why everyone is overlooking all the actual good songs on this album, which there are a few. ""Mockingbird"" is the best, then ""Like Toy Soldiers"", then ""Encore"", then ""1 Shot 2 Shot"", then ""Mosh"", then ""We As Americans"" and ""Love You More"" from the bonus disc. All those were in order from best to worst, and nobody gives any credit to those. By the way, I've had enough of these damn haters dissin' Eminem. He has three great albums and has talent. If you don't like an album, why the hell would you bother to even go onto the artist's website, let alone review the cd?! Just curious."
1,Forgot about Dre,"Encore is by far Em's worst album. It was the biggest dissapointment since Outkast's last album. I was an Eminem fan until now. Not only did the album suck, but then he turns yellow and apologizes to Ja Rule and Benzino. I couldn't even get past track 6 on the album because of the wacky beats. Whoever told him his beats were cool should be shot. Everyone can't be a producer the main reason the other three did so well was because of Dre. Dre had the beats and Em had the flow they were like Batman and Robin or the fat guy with the skinny friend. I miss the old Em because he was hungry and was hustled hard to get to the top. The truth is he doesn't need black people to sell records. He turned his back on BET and has now found his new home on MTV. His thousands and thousands of fans who are mostly white and will listen to anything he puts out. What happen to you EM? Only god knows."
2,2 1/2 stars,"I have to admit, I have never been a big Em fan because I find his lyrics to be (predominantly haha) very childish and lacking of any skill or substance. Against my better judgement I went out and purchased this CD. Right off the bat, I see that he has placed alot more retrospective thought into this album and you really feel like you got a little something out of it. I must say though, this does not an album make! You will tend to just get annoyed by most of the songs on the CD. I think that his G-Unit counterparts released far better albums, even for all 50s overexposure, the entire G-Unit have released alot tighter solos. There are like 2, possibly three tight songs on the CD (Ass Like That has an infecious beat). I guess you have to be like a hardcore Em fan to appreciate it. I am not. Like the old saying goes, to each is own. (just not for me in the future)--LusH"
2,Eminem's losing it,"I really loved eminems past three albums before this one. The naughty eminem who once loved poking fun of fat chicks and boy bands now seems too have grown too much of an ego and takes himself too serious. Ok, its great to grow up as an artist, but it sucks to grow up in order to make the world take you more serious. I think Eminem had his own style and was triumphant with it. I believe Eminem used humor in the past to get over with his life that once seemed hopeless but now he's become angry. He tries to fit in with the rest of the ""angry"" rappers and everytime does so, he becomes less original. I miss the eminem who didnt give a s*** about critics, politicians or anything...but now he's come out with a song that ""encourages people to go vote."" I sincerely think he does'nt really care about the elections. He's jumped in the bandwagon way too fast. Congrats Eminem, mainstream culture loves you."
1,What a BAD Encore....,"i waited sooooo long for a new album from him! and when i did get it. i realised that his encore is wack!der is like what..... NO good songs!!! the best track on the whole album, i found was a skit!!! ""Em Calls Paul (Skit)""i found that skit funny probably only because im a fan of MJ.im also a huge fan of eminem! but this is such a disappointment.I liked ""Mosh"" also but not for long..and plus... every1 is sick of him dissing Kim! i think we have heard enough of her after tha past few yearz.....Eminem doesnt even have to try, and he will sell records.This maybe bad but i no he will become good again!... He really did bad on this album."
1,Hm..,"Straight garbage. The only song I liked was ""Like Toy Soldiers"". ""Marshall Mathers LP"" rapes this. Past Eminem was better. Current Eminem sucks."
5,sexy album,let's see... where do i start with this?? THIS IS THE BEST F***ING ALBUM EM HAS BESIDES RECOVERY!!! XD i freakin love this album it adds humor to seriousness and em's idiotic genius to the songs and rhymes he spits.
2,Wow. That's all I can say.,"There are only 2 good songs on this album.I'm not even going to try to get deep into this. This will be as short as the best song on the album (Never Enough).Sucks.Beats: Overall, annoying.Raps: Decent."
3,LAST ALBUM,Finally his done (Yes last album this is true for more information go to allhiphop.com).Oh yeah Eminem is not a white Tupac now he's got these rich white kids thinkging there gangsta. Eminem acts black no that being gansta not black.Note to white folks and eminem a durag does not make you a thug.It is for black peoples hair not to look tuff
3,He's Finished!,"Ever since the first single ""just loose it"" and the fact that this is his last album, I knew it was going to be wack, or at least I wouldn't like it. I was right. I only bought it because I figured he would still bring his Lyrical Decapitating mentally. It's rarely shown, I gave 3 stars for the 3 songs I did like, ""Puke"" ""Rain Man"" and ""Big Weenie"" I'm not surprised at how lazy this CD is. This guy, all together has most likely sold about 40 million albums, (including the 8 mile soundtrack) and he only put out 4 albums! When that's the case your time is UP (Musically) and he knows that! I will never again buy an album if it's the artist's last one, cuz they get extremely lazy, they already have MILLIONS so they don't care!"
1,"Encore, Please eminem leave the Building","Encore *1/2 StarsDespite that he made fun at George W. Bus**** (Thank God), This is a disjointed album, just all of the other feminem albums he made, the same usual making fun at pop stars, And other things that has been done during the last 3 albums, Just Lose It is the absolute worst song in the history of rap and everything else (except Mosh) sucks too, this is the lead contender for the worst album of the year and it will be on my christmas list.Big Thumbs Down for Me."
1,Doo Doo Sauce,"Yo this cd is Boo Boo son, im really begining to hate this guy the cd has horrible production and bad lyrics for a guy like eminem this is one of the worst cd's of the year i am so angry that i have even listened to this garbage i wish i could give it negative stars."
1,bad,"you know a CD is wack when ""a music fan"" has to review it 10 times to higher the rating! Looks like dissing michael jackson and ruining martika's toy soldiers hit bit eminem in the (...) and now he's not as popular as he once was."
4,Better than I expected,Eminem gets a little full of himself a bit and it shows.This cd falls way short of expectations but still manages to produce enough good songs to keep my satisfied.
4,Different but good not for mainstream hip-hop lovers,People who like the mainstream crap will probably not like this album as much as the previous ones and think the album stinks. Anyone who can appreciate a great lyricist like Em and the def production of Dre. will like this album.
1,You don't relate to us no more,man when you were the angry poor white trash with a messed up life we understood you but you are the people u used to talk smack about ..M you are bigtime buster and this albums production was bunk. Sorry i really liked your music but you better hang up jersey.
4,He should have released Straight from the Lab EP instead!,"You owe it to yourself to buy this alblum if you're an Eminem fan. It may not rival The Eminem Show, but it's not half-bad. It's about time that he got back to some of his lighter lyrics. I for one am tired of hearing about how he went from rags to riches, about how he hates Kim, or about how screwed up his mom is. In that sense, this album, while still dark, is a relief.The down-side is that there aren't that many truly great hits on this CD. Don't expect to find a few songs on the same level as ""Just Lose It."" The bonus tracks are good; I'm glad to see he released ""We as Americans"" and ""Love You More,"" but I also wish he would have released ""Canab*tch,"" ""Bully,"" and ""Monkey See, Monkey Do."" Along with ""Mosh,"" and ""Like Toy Soldiers,"" this CD could have been much, much better. Who knows, maybe it'll grow on me. Again, it's good, don't get me wrong, but you know what they say, ""good is the enemy of great!"""
2,Eminem Fan,"I have been an fan of Em from the first silly single, but heard the rest of the first album and I was hooked. The first 3 albums were great, but this album is not. It is really hard to beat the first 3 albums and this doesnt even come close. I've heard people say since Em has had all his beef with Ja and Benzino that they wish he wouldnt take himself so seriously, well he didnt on this album. The only difference is it came out with alot of good word play, but no substance. I know in the future he can make an album equal to or better then the first 3, but I guess we will have to wait a couple years."
1,UR A WIGER!!! ur the white micheal jackson!,"alrite... enimen.. u r a white boy from a trailor park... u sing about crap... u may b musically talented but u shud stop making some damn rap crap homie!!! please, do urself a favor"
5,Whats wrong with everybody....,"This CD is phenominal. This is a great CD from start to finish. It's a heck of a lot better than most of the crap thats come out this year. Nobody has really got it done for me as in terms of a whole hot album. Face it the quality of hip hop may be declining but Eminem is still hot. From the intro to the bonus tracks, it's all fire. My favorites include ""Just lose it"", ""Toy Soldiers"", and ""Never Enough"". I give this Cd a 5 because ""The Eminem Show"" was good but it could had been better, and this album is that and more. It's up there with ""The Marshall Mathers LP"". This CD is gonna sell of course because it's good!!! Great job Eminem. Now where's Detox (which is hinted at the end by Dre and Eminem)."
1,eeeeeeewwwwwwwww!,Good thang i only paid 5 bucks 4 this dum wannabe wanker. Maybe the reel slimm shady died and this is an imposter?
1,Eminem is a hypocrit,"Mr. Jackson doesn't need to be picked on by this ""rapper"" if you can call him that.Mr. Jackson is the biggest selling artist in music history.Eminem is a hypocrit. I'll tell you how: Weird Al does parodies of many artists including Mr. Jackson, Prince, Madonna, and Coolio. He doesn't embarrass them, but does it in a kind way that is entertaining. Its an honor for Weird Al to parody you. When Weird Al told Eminem that Al wanted to make a parody of ""Lose Yourself"", Eminem said ""No, I don't want to look bad."" Well Em, you sure have done a good job trying to hurt Mr. Jackson.Well, no ones on your side, but your physco kiddy fans. New's hosts, entertainers including big stars are defending MJ against your disgusting act. You dont' deserve a music career to sing....oh I forgot, you can't sing."
3,mosh,"I love eminems music. I own all his albums. I just listened to his new album. I don't know if I like it that much but after listening to it more times I am sure it will grow on me. The song I do not care for is ""mosh"". Is this song attacking president Bush? Well that's what I heard and if he is than I can promise you that he will lose a lot of fans including me. He has know right to talk bad about what the president has done for our country because he could never do his job. I am very proud of our president. Yea so eminem disrespects everyone but he's pushing it.!!!!"
3,"Sure, why not?","I don't think Eminemn is very..smart, and I'm nit a HUGE fan, but this album iss his best, and I think maybe people who hated him before MIGHT change their minds."
1,GARBAGE..,Just like the trailer trash that he is. Best left out on the curb so the punks can carry it away!
1,Response To Shadow,"This Shadow reviewer said that Eminem made fun of more people than Michael Jackson: Madonna, Nysync, Moby etc. Fair enough, but wait. You must remember something.Did Eminem puke on them? Did he pull their noses off? Did he imply they were criminals? Michael Jackson is innocent, and having Eminem trying to defame the biggest selling artist in history is completely immature and shows that Eminem ""has NOT grown up"".However, I may be one of the BILLIONs of MJ supporters slamming Eminem, but I must say, I've listened to this piece of junk. My friend owns it, but she too, was dissapointed. She sold it to the used CD store.""Like Toy Soldiers"" and ""Puke"" are just immature, and shows that he has ran out of material and substance. ""Mosh"" is completely silly, and yet, stupid.So, Eminem's career looks like it has haulted to the stop...though he tried to do that with MJ. However, MJ is invincible, and obviously, doesn't take crap from amateur entertainers."
2,Disappointed,"So what, he made WEAK Anti-Bush song. Let's go sorm the White House because Eminem said so. What a joke. A little late there buddy, the elections were two weeks ago. Is Eminem on the verge of falling off? As other reviews have said, he has lost his hunger. He's bored. He has nothing left to spit anymore. It just seems like this CD was too hurried. I'm not hating, I'm just disappointed. What happened to his untouchable creativity? His past CDs are classics. This one is over-rushed pop trash."
4,Very Good Album,"I have bought all three of Eminem's records so far and they have been fasinating. He bashes all these people in rhymes that really make sense. He doesn't whine all the time that he grew up in poverty but he does talk about his father very much and it's getting pretty old. I would rate this album an excellant buy becuase it's the Deluxe Edition which includes the 2nd CD. A few good songs are ""Just Lose It,"" ""Mosh,"" ""Evil Deeds,"" ""Puke,"" and ""Mockingbird."" This isn't probably his greatest album because my favorites are The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP. I would buy this CD but I would buy better albums of his first. I think he did a very good job on it but he could have done better."
4,Not completely silly.,"Ok, I will come right out and say it. This isn't as good as his old cds. The angry, violent, and intense songs are gone. Most of the songs on this cd are more comedic than anything else. But that is the beauty of Eminem, as he said in one of his first singles, he just doesn't give a f**k. People think he is writing these songs for no other purpose than to be funny, but it isn't as simple as that. Eminem has already hit success, not only as a rapper, but as an actor and producer. We know all about his past, do you honestly want to hear another song about kim? The underlying theme of this cd is that Eminem can say whatever he wants. You think he is joking and being silly? Doesn't matter, he can say whatever the hell he wants, because he is EMinem and you will buy his cd. Maybe I am reading into this cd too much, but I still some wit behind the silly lyrics and sound effects."
3,not at his best!,"i go as far as to say eminem has slowly become the target of the critics. this album is different and has shown me that he is very creative and is a great producer. encore in my opinion has lackluster beats and seems like em is struggling with his lyrics. point in mind big weenie and puke. em is going to make alot of money but he still cant make a serious album.great: mockingbird,spend some time like toy soldiers crazyinlovegood: yellow brick road encoregarbage: the rest of the album"
1,Big disappointment,If there was a 0 star I'd give that EMinems new album 'POINT BLANK'' sucks Encore is overrated and a Big disappointment.. It's cheesy I was expecting awhole lot more I think EMs past his time DONT BUY THIS ALBUM ITS NOT WORTH $10 BUCKS...
2,"I love every signle Eminem album, but even for me this is a letdown","I love every single Eminem album from Infinite to Relapse, but this album is just awful. Most songs here have awful, annoying beats with dry and less meaningful lyrics. The songs just dont have that spark that Eminem songs usually have. There are, however, two of Em's best songs from this album:Mockingbird- This is one of my favorite Eminem songs ever. He is full of emotion here, making a truely beautiful and meaningful song to his daughter Hailie.Like Toy Soldiers- Just a plain good song. Great beat and chorus, and very meaningful with well-written lyrics.Other than those two, awful album. Oh well, Em made up for it by making Relapse."
1,Trash,"This is the worst album I have ever bought by any artist. He used to rap well and have intelligent lyrics. On this album he got juvenile with his lyrics and tried to sing but he has no voice. I liked the four preceding albums to this one. Infinite, Slim shady LP, Marshall Mathers LP, and the Eminem show were excellent. Now he's making garbage like this. He sold out big time."
4,couldve been better....,"This is a solid album no doubt but it seems like eminem didnt put as much thought or whatever u wanna call it as he did in his previous albums.With songs like just lose youself and big weenie i was like wtf was he thinkin.Overall the album does actually have some good songs like mockingbird,mosh,like toy soldiers,rain man which didnt make a whole lot of sense but just the way he rhymes on that track he kills it,and spend some time the chorus was crazy.All of the other tracks were just aight nothing special but i do recommend this cd just to complete your eminem collection but def not his best..."
2,Average album,"Eminem seriously underachieved on this album, its average, no where near his previous 3 releases...Best Songs:Like Toy SoldiersMockingbirdRain ManEvil Deeds"
1,the day has come when people realized that em is OVERRATED,"this album really is just terrible, there's not much else to say, i hate this album and i hate interscope records for controlling the mainstream rap industry, if you support this album you are not a fan of real hip hop."
4,Encore by Eminem,"Ok, first off these poor reviews on this album are wrong. This is a really good album, its just as good as 2002's THE EMINEM SHOW, despite what people say. The best songs are Big weenie, One shot- two shot, mosh, and Yellow brick road where he apoligizes for the racist tracks, and tells about his life. This is better, thats right i said it than THE EMINEM SHOW. Buy this and his 1s't album THE SLIM SHADY LP, those are his best two!4 1/2 stars"
4,It's ok,I have been an Eminem fan since I heard the first cd. The Encore cd is ok but I did not buy the album to hear a different Eminem. I bought the album because I am a fan and I like it regardless of if he sounds different or whatever.
2,'A** like that' insult to foreiners,"To be honest the song 'A** like that' insults foreiners (mainly hindus if you can here the background music) and makes bold statements about how foreiners only want to have sex and sell drugS.Since I'm behing honest I might as well say that I like that song and that I didn't care about the lyrics until I read them.'Please I'm a human being I have needs, I'm not done, not til I'm finished peeing'in an forein accent can be very insulting.I (...)rate this 2 stars for insultment to forein accents. (But it's so damn catchy)"
1,Feminem,"Garbage album,only song worth listening to is Toy soldier,besides that,the only good thing this cd could be used for is a cup holder.I used to be an Em fan but realized that he's one of the most overrated rappers of all time along with Jay-Z,Lil Wayne,and Biggie.Em raps about stupid s**t.Em third album ""The Eminem Show"" was also garbage.His first 2,were good but thats it for him.Feminem is just a comedian rapper nothing else more and he ran out of ideas.He's done.Don't buy this garbage.P.S Kinda sad I got this cd as a Christmas present."
2,If Feminem's Fans Only Had a Mind....,"If they only had a brain...all they had to do was go to the wizard. Give them a heart: So Em knows not to diss the King of Pop: Michael. Give him a brain: Take away his hypocritical statments, and regurgitated crap. Courage: Courage to get back at Michael..after Michael made Eminem look like a fool.To all of you sad, worthless Eminem fans: No one is on your side. News anchors, celebrities..etc...are on MJ's side! Em looks like he lost it...and finally...we get some fresh air."
4,Decent,"Even though there is a lot of flaws on this album, I still think there is tracks on here that are good. Not a classic album but not a weak album either. Its decent. I'd still cop it if I were you. Theres some tracks that I was like ehh whats this? But some tracks that were hott for sure.#1.Curtains Up#2.Evil Deeds - 8/10#3.Never Enough - 8/10#4.Yellow Brick Road - 10/10#5.Like Toy Soilders - 10/10#6.Mosh - 8.5/10#7.Puke - 8/10#8.My 1st Single - 8.5/10#9.Paul#10.Rain Man - 6.5/10#11.Big Weenie - 6.5/10#12.Em Calls Paul#13.Just Lose It - 7/10#14.Ass Like That - 8/10 (Funny)#15.Spend Some Time - 10/10#16.Mockingbird - 10/10#17.Crazy In Love - 7.5/10#18.One Shot 2 Shot - 10/10#19.Final Thought Skit#20.Encore - 10/10Decent album, not the best though"
2,first 50/50 review on Eminem from me,"Eminem is truly talented but this album, seems almost like a game compared to The Marshall Matters Lp and The Eminem Show, sorry but Eminem, i know likes to have fun poking fun of other celebrities but the gags go way too far, and this album is not even close to as serious as his past albums."
2,Don't waste your money or time.,"Don't buy this CD.I can't believe I just typed that, but it is my strong advice for any fan of Eminem's previous releases.Some tracks are very good, such as ""Mosh"", ""Evil Deeds"", ""Never Enough"". Even ""Toy Soldiers"" and ""Yellow Brick Road"" feature unique beats and articulate lyrics. The rest of the tracks are totally opposite. Lyrics are jumbled, often don't even rhyme, and sometimes just make no sense. There isn't any of the sharp wit or humor of his previous releases. Far too many of these tracks feature farting and burping sounds, Pee-Wee Herman screeching, and monotonous singing of inane chorus lines.After watching Eminem's ""Mosh"" video, I was very excited for the release of this CD. I am fairly tolerant of artists changing their style, but after playing it through several times, I can no longer stand it. I am literally embarassed to play this CD in public. This may end up being Eminem's last CD, whether he planned it or not."
2,How many times can you make the exact same CD?,Well once again we have the silly single(Just Lose It) and then the serious one(Mosh) Once again we have a song about Hailey(Mockingbird)and an angry song about the ex-wife.(Puke) Don't get me wrong lyrically he's on point(as usual) but well.....what's new ya know? This makes me wonder what kind of depth Eminem has as an artist. I mean in 10 years will we be hearing the exact same thing or what?
1,Eminem Fan,"I have loved Eminem since his first CD, he has always had great performed at a very high level in every aspect of his cds. But this cd is absolutely terrible. I hope that this is just a big joke from Eminem and he is proving that he can just crap out a cd and it will go multi-platinum, because it will.But if anyone actually think this CD is well made, they must love the CD because its Eminem, not because of the music. He has no feeling in his voice, he has horrible lyrics, and the production sounds like it was made in someone's garage.Every CD before this I absolutely love, but I am dumbfounded so many people think this is a great CD, how can you say that. I think Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of all time, that is why it is so hard to hear this CD, its absolutely terrible in every aspect."
1,Never been more disappointed by an artist...,"Wow. I expected great things out of this album, especially after the others were so incredibly good. Encore is just a re-hashing of pretty much all the same topics in his other albums but he seems to have lost all of his artistic ability. The lyrics are nowhere near the quality Mathers established on his previous albums; some of them are just plain stupid. Eminem seems to be running out of things to write about. I'll definitely won't buy his next CD without hearing it first.Awful."
1,worst eminem album,i am a huge eminem fan and this is by far his worst album yet...so disappointed he would even consider putting this album out
1,"Eminem? You are as ""GAY"" as Andy Dick!!!!!!!","Anyone as obsessed with threatening a skinny little gay man like Moby and hurling slangs at him is simply gay themsleves and in denial. And stupid lyrics to boot- like ""Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark..."" Pussy! Elton John made him look like a no-talent when he played next to him. I'm glad his overexposure is over."
1,twinkle...twinkle...single star,ok ..eminem thats it..you have reached the verigo of your insanity.there is no need to give any advise for people above 18for those who are below 18...PARENTAL ADVISORY: this album contains some explicit weirder contents so dont buy it for any reason..incase if you have already bought this album ..KEEP IT AWAY FROM YOUR CHILDREN or else your children will become someone like EMINEM in future..
5,I liked it; so there!,"I am a huge Eminem fan, and I have all of his albums (including this one). O.K., so he's not quite the same guy he was when he made ""The Slim Shady LP""; big deal! Eminem has grown and changed over the years, but he hasn't lost his edge. From the politically-charged ""Mosh"", to the funny-as-hell ""Just Lose It"", to the ""Em calls Paul"" skit (the best part of the album; Michael Jackson, you brought it on yourself!), this is his best work yet. My rating: 10/10."
3,3.5 Stars To The Man Who Tried,"Eminem has done some really kooo albums in the past.But This is not one of them.He really tried to make this album kooo but failed to do so.But my personal favorites are Like Toy Soldiers,Puke,Big Weenie,Ass Like That,and One Shot,2Shot.If you are an Eminem fanatic (like me) you would go and buy this but if your barley starting to like Eminem then I recommend you buy his best album The Marshall Mathers LP.Overall he gets 50/100.Which is not so good.Hopefully him and Game make a record together.Now that would be kooo!"
3,Not his best but still try'in!,"I gonna make this as brief as possible. I got much love for Em, but I was very disappointed in this cd. I don't know if this album was rushed or what! I thought he would have more club bangers like""Lose It."" My other favorite tracks were ""Mosh,"" ""Yellow Brick Road,"" and ""Encore."" His last cd, The Eminem Show was way better then this cd. Anyway, if you're a Em fan like me, don't be surprised if it is not what you expected. Maybe you just have to absorb Em's thoughts more."
2,"Worst eminem album, and a step backwards for creativity.","It is clear by this album that he has nothing new to say other than he loves his daughter, he hates his mom and he hates kim. Whooooo there is some new news. hah!This album is honestly the worst eminem album out. I have all of ems old albums and to this day i can listen to them over and over. I got sick of this album before I had heard half the songs. There are only a couple of good songs but by good I dont mean to the same degree as his old albums. Simply that there are a couple of songs you can actually stand to listen to.The cheesy... This album is the source of eminems cheesiest single yet.The bad... His old albums had songs that were not a favorite, but this album has songs that I will literally never listen to more than the intro (the time it takes me to hit the next button).I have to say that this albums date of release and content show that he is simply cashing in on loyal fans, with little or no concern for his content."
2,Skip the Encore,"I love Em's previous albums, almost every track of every CD which for me is uncommon. However, with Encore that is not the case. I bought this based on the fact I liked his previous CDs thankfully I only paid $9.99 at Best Buy for it. I think this release is going to have a lot of variance with his fans but ultimately I wouldn't be surprised if the majority agrees this is not his best CD.So what makes this so bad compared to his previous CDs? While I don't mind Em experimenting with his style, Encore has a radical departure from anything else. I'm hard pressed to even think of even one song I really like. I love songs like ""My Name Is"", ""Without Me"", ""The Slim Shady"".My only recommendation is listen to a friend's copy first or something before buying it. In the meantime, I guess I'll have to wait 2 more years for his next album and hope it will be the same level of quality as The Marshall Mathers LP."
2,"Once you lose the edge, its time to turn in your wings","And thats exactly what happened on this album. I could not believeit when I listened to each track, I kept waiting for Em to come out and blow me away, but it never happened. I have seem Eminem in concert a few times and always thought he could do no wrong, but he just did putting out this album. I hope this is not his last, he can't end it like this!"
3,Un-decidable album,"This album (as stated in another review) doesn't seem to gel well as an album piece like the previous 3. It does have some good moments like ""Like Toy Soldiers"", ""Just Lose It"" and ""Mosh"" but unlike the other offerings this album just doesn't have songs that jump out at you like ""Till I Collapse"" or ""Kim"" it seems very... well, very bland. The blue cover seems to represent the album well. It is a good album but why it took 2 years to write and get out here is a mystery, if this IS the end then it's a bad ending. I must say though, the sleeve is disturbing... more so than any I would say I have seen, I expect repurcussions for the sleeve alone!Average album and I would say the worst out of The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show. Each album he improved... this album he seemed to step back instead of forward."
3,It's A Decent CD But It's His Worst Solo CD He's Made Yet,"At First When I Heard Encore I Was Really Disappointed, It Reminded Me A lot Of D12 World Which Wasn't Really Good. But Then I Gave It A Chance And Kept Listening To It And It Grew On Me. This Album Is A lot Different From His Other Three. There's Less Serious Songs And More Cheesy Funny Ones. And It Seems Like He Concentrated More On Making Beats With Bass Then Decent Lyrics. The Songs That Stood Out To Me Were; Evil Deeds, Puke, Rain Man, Just Lose It, Ass Like That, Crazy In Love, And Curtains Up Feat Dr.Dre & 50 Cent. If You're A Big Fan Of Eminem You Should Like This CD But This CD Isn't Really For People Who Aren't Big Fans."
3,Could have been beter.,"This CD was alright. I was expecting much better. I am writting this review while still listening the CD waiting for it to be more then ok. There are a few songs on this CD that surpass the perfect junction. I think the lyrics in ""Like Toy Soldiers"" are the lyrics a powerful rapper such as Eminem needed to say. He set the business straight. That song and Mockingbird are very pasionate. Other then that there are a couple of songs that are worth listening to, but I must say its Eminem, and all fans of Eminem and true rap should buy this just to support what Eminem has given to all us over the years. Buy it, it might grow on you as it is growing on me every time I listen to it. You might be let down your first go through it, but youll be pleased with what you get out of the few songs that do hit you. Even with un-Eminem esque songs such as ""puke"" and ""meenie"" and others."
5,Newer Style,"Definitely a good buy, but Em fans who loved his first 2 LP's may not like the style of these songs, similar to those of 'The Eminem Show'.Em shows his classic sense of humor on tracks such as ""my 1st single"", ""rain man"", ""big weenie"", ""just lose it"", and ""ass like that"", but also shows his serious side when he raps about the usual suspects such as ex-wife kim, daughter halie and his rap beefs."
2,Not the best,I like Eminem's music but I thought that this cd was pretty much a redo of all of his other work. I did not like it at all. I loved the bonus tracks though. I wouldn't recommend getting too excited about it.
2,Pop Hip-Hop,"I will write the most brutally and honest review of this cd that I can. I really think that this is the biggest joke of a cd that i have ever heard. Why do u ask that? Well the only song that i think would be considered listenable is ""Never Enough"". That song is hot and the verses from Em and 50 are hot. But the rest of the album is ridiculous, from Ass like that, to Puke, to his dumb single Just lose it, to Rain man which is very stupid and not funny at all. I mean honestly i dont get why all you idiots are buying this album and saying it is actually good. The only reason that this album gets 2 stars is because of that one hot song. The rest of the album is just a joke. PLease for the sake of good hip hop dont buy this album. I made that mistake and am on my way to Strawberries for a return and buy some real hip hop like Nas."
2,Eminem got soft after his 2nd album,I thought em's 4th cd was gonna be his best yet from all the hype it got in magazines and all that but i ended up real dissapointed. there are a couple of songs that save the album from being 1 star but the rest is garbage. Just Lose It was the most commercial single em ever made.
1,Will Someone PLEASE Pull The Plug?,And stop polluting our airwaves with insane babble and egocentric lyrics. I honestly don't understand how there can even be a market out there for this garbage. No wonder the world is going to hell in a handbasket... This CD only furthers that belief.
4,Its the last chapter,"Everyone is complaining how this album is crap and isn't as good as his others. Thats how it was meant to be. The man has acomplished so much and maybe one of the only thing that needs to be done is to put out crap and see if people still buy it. Like he said in rain man he just made a song and didn't say s***. Everyone also is complaining about the lack of anger. Eminem has been angry forever, isn't he 32? Maybe he's just tired of being angry. When you listen to the album keep in mind that it is his last album. You'll realize that hes just closing up, clarifying, and explaining every issue that he has been faced with. This album is the last chapter and afterwards the book is closing. An album like this leaves people satisfied and not anticipating more."
2,biggest disapointment of 04,"I believe Encore was a horrible choice for the title because this album is not an encore of his last album. I don't know where Em picked up this new type of flow[whiny,nasal pitched singing voice] but it's garbage. Even the singles are wack. Why write Mosh, was White America not good enough. Just Lose It is especially weak, even the video. It seems Em put no thought in this project and it shows in almost every track. What's most shocking is the production. It's horrible. No matter how bad this record is there are a few highlights like when track 20 is finished the agony of listening to this uninspired crap is over. I swear listening to this is the equivelant of chinese water torture."
2,WHAT ?!?,"Can anyone explain just what happend to the talented artist he used to be...I gave him 2 stars an I'm so full of guilt because this CD is a complete joke. So many sounds and background noises taken from other tracks...is he gettin' lazy or what? I just can't believe I waited for that piece of junk. You can listen the album all day long and not a single track seemed to have been done in more than 5 minutes. The main track...just lose it...guess what...it's about his touch! But hey, he's human and Encore proves it."
1,His Fans Dont Have a Mind,"If they only had a brain...all they had to do was go to the wizard. Give them a heart: So Em knows not to diss the King of Pop: Michael. Give him a brain: Take away his hypocritical statments, and regurgitated crap. Courage: Courage to get back at Michael..after Michael made Eminem look like a fool.To all of you sad, worthless Eminem fans: No one is on your side. News anchors, celebrities..etc...are on MJ's side! Em looks like he lost it...and finally...we get some fresh air."
1,Manufactured Noise!,"This type of ""music"" should be outlawed as far as I'm concerned. It's nothing more than manufactured noise with pointless lyrics and a monotonous beat. No wonder the generation of today is so corrupted! Marshall Mathers, take my advice and go back to Detroit! You'll fit right in with those folks!"
1,Don't buy it.Waste of time,Eminem is finished.He cant rap.Dont buy this cd.Buy R&G Snoop's Dogg new cd or Crunk Juice or R.U.L.E.
1,Eminem is overrated,"I don'y know how people can love that. It's a weak album and it proves Eminem is overrated. Stupid lyrics, and when he begin to sing chorus, it's horrible. So, don't buy it."
1,i aint ever seen an ass like Eminem,"This sucks. Big time. Eminem only had two decent records, Marshall mathers and Slim Shady. Eminem Show is okay. Buy his older stuff, when he was still fresh. Now he just reapeats himself. Ass like that is the stupidest song of all time"
1,Too much effort,"Em put too much effort in this album that it ended up comming out crappy. Maybe it was the 50 cent influence that messed his flow up, I dunno. Has anyone else notice that Eminem tends to like twitch his eye like in a wierd way. Something is up with him for sure. But anyways he needs to chill out a little bit for his next album cuz we do not want anything like this ever again. Thank You."
3,"This could've been a better album, Average...","This album is merely average to say the least. Eminem was smart to use the singles ""Just Lose It"" and ""Mosh"" to propel his sales. This album just lacks in something that it seems Eminem had on his previous releases. It doesn't live up to the hype that other Eminem albums have rightfully gotten, with controversy always surrounding their content. I was highly disappointed by the very first track the minute I began playing it. ""Just Lose It"" and ""Mosh"" are the two strongest selections compared to the rest of the album. 3 Stars."
2,How about something new?,"After 4 albums, I know about every personal problem Eminem has ever had in his life. I didn't need 2 cds off this album to tell me anything more.Yeah, your mom was bad and your dad left you. I have pity, but please for the love of God and everything that is holy, leave it out of your next album.You've heard the lyrics before. Sadly almost every track has the same beat. What is new here?Skip this album unless you need a frisbee."
3,"Catchy songs, but very few masterpieces","A lot of fans said they were missing the Slim Shady persona from the first two albums. Those fans will be satisfied with this album. Eminem has returned to his usual routine of taking cheap shots at defenseless targets like Michael Jackson, Jessica Simpson, and even the 14-year-old pop princess, Jojo.However, if you are an Eminem fan who, like myself, believe he flourishes on his most personal tracks (such as ""Rock Bottom"" on his first LP, ""Marshall Mathers"" on his second, and ""Cleaning out My Closet"" on his third), you will find yourself greatly disappointed by Eminem's fouth release. Other than ""Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Like Toy Soldiers,"" ""Mosh"" and ""Mockingbird,"" this album is full of cuts that, although catchy and amusing, have no substance and are not up to par with the expectations of Eminem fans."
2,What is this?!?!?!,this is the worst cd i have heard eminem put out. i loved his old stuff but this is so off that i could just ring his neck for it. im not even going to bother putting much here other than his sound is really different and i dont like it >:[
5,Round of Applause for Encore,"This has to be Em's most original album. That man's delivery is crazy and the bars that he spits are crazy but it demands fans to listen to what he's saying. The hooks are subpar at times but only towards the middle of the album. That's my only problem. Many people have to stop expecting him to give an exact duplicate of the classic albums that he's released in the past. This album is a classic for different reasons. He gave aspects of each persona, something that the Eminem Show lacked. On the last album, he was so personal that the Slim Shady persona was abandoned on every track but two (Without Me, Dad's Gone Crazy) I loved this album, I havent skipped a track yet, although Ass Like That is something that has to grow on you, other than that, each song is hot for its own reasons. Dre really delivered on this album as well. Props to Marshall for this album."
1,"Sad, and Pitiful","Eminem has no substance, and no ground to be creative on anymore.BUY MICHAEL JACKSON THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION INSTEAD!"
1,"Some Misfit Has Posted 10 ""five star"" reviews in one day!","There is one dimwit who has posted dozens of reviews on this site under fake names if you look at the string of supposed ""five star"" reviews that are one or two sentences long, well, can you call them sentences? I'm starting to think this ""person"" is a monkey or mentally ill. I guess he has nothing better to do than defend a worthless album. If you remove this ONE FOOL'S reviews this CD gets less than 2 stars!"
3,Very Disappointed,"I've been a fan of Eminem since he burst onto the Rap scene, in fact, he was the first rapper i ever listened to. But THIS, was a HUGE disappointment.He's still got some lyrical genius, which can be seen on tracks like 'Mockingbird', 'Like Toy Soldiers' and a FEW otheres. However he totaly ruins this album by putting on annoying meaningless crap like 'Big Weenie' and 'Ass Like That'. 'Just Lose It' was also one of the worst songs on the album, at the start it was ok, but if you think it's a good song after time and time again, you know nothing about Hip-Hop.Giving this album 3 stars is being kind.Please bring back the old Marshall Mathers that caught the attention of our ears in the first place, not this rich successful rapper who sounds like he's lost his lust for music :-(."
1,Give up,Give up eminem youre finished.This cd is very bad.I only liked youre 1st cd.Now youre dead to me.PEACE
2,What?!,"Man, what happened to Em's seriousness? I am an Eminem fan, but this CD is full of happiness, and is not the serious side of Eminem I had expected when i purchased this CD. I'm pretty dissapointed."
1,I Be Hatin',Because this cd is laaaaaaaame y'all. It's fun to watch this little pecker post obssessively..check it out..he's doing it as I type..what a wanker
1,"This is noise pollution, pure crap!","This along with all rap is crap. This has got to be the dumbest most pathetic and feeble genre of music ever. There are no good elements in rap. Every rapper has to put on some tough attitude like being a punk is cool, because of that almost every kid at my school acts like a punk and tries to live the rap lifestyle. There is nothing musical about this either, it is just a guy talking over top of a computerized beat, bad poetry at best. This genre along with all the emo bands out there and nu metal bands and of course pop is killing off music. Thank god bands like silvertide and rose hill drive are coming along to save the world of music. Maybe they will bring us back to a time when musci was good like in the 70's and 60's. MTV is killing off music, please do not watch it. F**k MTV."
1,Bad in almost every sense of the word.,"Bad: Adjective1. More inferior, as in quality, condition, or effect.2. More severe or unfavorable.3.

By this I mean, take out Puke, My 1st Single, Rain Man, Big Weenie, Just Lose It, and Spend Some Time. This makes the CD infinitely (no pun intended) better."
1,why!!!,"why is this retard still poluting the airwaves i dont care about the explicit lyrics. but come on what garbage my thing is rock, dont buy this, youd be better off going to the freakin flea market and buying a Yoko ono cd thats how bad this is, why is he still doing this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,suck ass,"suck ass cd. eminem has gotten wack. big weenie and 1 shot 2 shot are so annoying. this cd has just a few good songs like never enough,ass like that,just lose it and encore. the bonus cd is just a waste of time though. i'm glad i didn't buy this one"
2,Worst Solo Release,"Anyone who tries to say it is not his worst solo CD is fooling themselves. There are a few ok tracks, but for the most part Encore Blows. By the way, Mosh is NOT one of the good tracks, it's a rehash from the 8 mile disc and just because it agrees with your political beliefs doesn't make it a good track. (And doesn't change the fact that the pres was re-elected) Stick with the Slim Shady album and Marshall M album, don't waste your $$ here. Will I buy the next album? Likely, but I'll wait until I hear about it first before running out to buy it the first day."
3,ENCORE,EMINEM HIT US WITH A ANOTHER GOOD ONE IN 2004 EMINEM REALESED ENCORE A VERY FUNNY ALBUM WITH SONGS LIKE JUST LOSE IT AND LIKE TOY SOLDIERS AND MANY MORE FUNNY ONES BUT ENCORE WAS IT AS GREAT OF AN ALBUM AS THE EMINEM SHOW CD THAT DROPPED IN 2002 BUT ENCORE STILL HIT US HARD WITH TRACKS LIKEMOCKINGBIRD AND LIKE TOY SOLDIERS BUT ENCORE STILL REMAINS AS EMINEMSWROST ALBUM ON THE CHARTS BUT I THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD ALBUM WITH FUNNYONES LIKE JUST LOSE IT AND RAIN MAN AND DR. DRE STILL LAYS THE BEST BEATSDOWN AS ALWAYS ALOT POEPLE DISLIKE THIS ALBUM BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD ALBUM WITH GREAT SONGS THANKS FOR READING MY REVEIW WELL SEE YOU.
3,Disappointing Follow Up to The Eminem Show,"It's finally happened. The guy has run out of things to say...the lyrics are no longer inspired and most songs border on the inane. If you don't have it already, go buy his last album instead."
3,I guess I Can tackle this one,"Ok, so as with many of the CDs I review, I heard this CD played in my store.I listened to it all the way through.Now, yes, he has matured, a LOT. His samples and beats are neat, but overall this CD tended to be a bit boring. It wasn't his most creative, even if it was his most vulnerable. I wouldn't call it generic, just not Slim's best.However, I do recommend this for any Slim Shady fan."
2,Rome is Burning,"Dear God...if one could actually watch Lou Gehrig suffer Lou Gehrig's, day by day...well it'd be like listening to Eminem's career/legacy disentigrate on this album...c'mon man, don't be Sandler...don't trade your high standards for a couple extra bones. I feel victim."
2,"Eminem, what happened to you?","This album is crap. The beats are terrible, and the lyrics are worse. There are only a few songs worth hearing; Evil Deeds, Like Toy Soldiers, Mosh, Mockingbird, and One Shot, Two Shot. Everything else is total s**t. Many of his songs try to be funny, but are just plain annoying (Puke, Rain Man, Big Weenie, and Ass like that). In Rain Man, Eminem can't even keep the rythem. If you want to get an Eminem Cd, I'd suggest Infinite. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,OMG Am I The Only One That See He's Getting Wack,"The Album Is Really A 2.5 but hey don't have that on the ratings. He Is giving out the same bull every album and now its just getting annoying. First single is always on some joke type ish and its wack. Second single is a serious track which he tries to make himslef seem serious when he is just a joke. He follows the same track type in every album 3 tracks about how he hate kim, 3 about how he hate his mom, 3 joke/not serious tracks, 1 i love kim track, 2 growing up white b.s. track, 2 daughter tracks, and it all adds up to the marshal mathers bullsh*t. Follow this format people and you two can become a great overrated rapper like eminem."
4,Good Album,"Another good Eminem album. Encore delivers most of the time and offers some new hits. Key Tracks: ""Crazy In Love"", ""Mockingbird"", ""Puke"", ""Like Toy Soldiers"", ""A** Like That"""
2,Looks Like He Lost It,"Yeah I'm sure a hundred people have joked that ""Just Lose It"" is prophetic of what happened to Shady. I thought ""Mosh"", although wack musically but good lyrics, would be the real ""Encore"" but sadly this cd is just plain weak. Just because he is Eminem is no excuse to release sheeyat. Maybe he's just run out of ideas? The whole celebrity bashing to get attention routine is transparent. Gee how creative to kick Michael Jackson when he's done. That's an easy target. Whatever was special about this guy seems to be gone. I wouldn't be surprised if he quit music in a few years and tried to be an actor."
1,Yeah same guy,Yeah that guys that are given eminem 5 stars is the same guy.Do you love eminem.What kind of [...] thing is that.Don't do that.It's bad
2,He's run out of ideas,"I was afraid that Eminem would not be able to top himself after ""Lose Yourself,"" and I see I was more or less right. This album isn't bad, but it really isn't good either. I'm playing it in the office right now, and none of my coworkers like it, and they all liked Eminem in the past. Encore? I don't think so."
1,Not rap but crap,"Total trash. Don't get me wrong, I liked Eminem's older albums a lot. His style has completely changed now, and it seems like he's made this album just for the sake of making a bloody album, rather than expressing himself via his medium of music. Each and every song except the one I describe below is unbearable.The one star was for the song ""Mockingbird,"" which, although overly sentimental, did show that he is capable of positive emotions (i.e. how he loves and cares about his daughter). I like this and consider it the only redeeming feature of Encore.I gave this album a chance and I regretted it. It's a stupid, stupid album full of retarded garbage. Spend your money anywhere else and you'll be sure to get more enjoyment out of it."
4,I Will Miss You Eminem,"Eminem is definitely one of the best rappers out. He has an original style all his own. And this final cd, shows just that. He keeps the crazy jokes and sharp lyrics going on through out the album. He has some decent beats too. I respect him for leaving the industry, so that he doesn't over due it and cause fans to lose respect for him. Much love Em, you had a good run. Any true Eminem fan, should definitely have this album."
1,Crap,"Hip Hop now is in a state of redunacy where everyone is rapping about money, cars, ice and hos. Granted, Eminem is not rapping about these trivial matters, but how often can we hear about his problems with his mom, ex wife and so forth? This album is a recycle of previous work, yet people praise him for being innovative."
1,What the HELL Was He Thinking???,"I don't know what (or even who) this is supposed to be, but it's NOT EMINEM as we once knew him. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show, but for crying out loud, what on earth was he thinking? This whole thing sounds like it was put together in a week! And I'm sorry, but ""PUKE"" shouldn't have been included here at all. Maybe certain folks find bathroom humor funny, but not me. I've listened to the CD nearly half a dozen times now, and I just can't warm up to it. Maybe next time he'll get his act together-literally. Pass this one up. A complete bomb."
1,Same guy,"Hey,this guys that are given eminem 5 stars is always the same dude.Do you love eminem?Are you faggot or something like that.Stop doing that.This cd is bad"
1,This album really sucks.,"I am not hating on Em. I have ALL of his albums and all of them are hot. When I heard this cd, I was really disappointed. He has fell off. On that note, I hate when people write reviews, and tell other people to stop hating on someone just because they do not like the album. Everyone does not like the same things and is entitled to their own opinion."
1,What is this?,Is this a CD.I don't think so.I mean what guy pukes on a song.That's terrible.Eminem do as a big favor and retire yourself.This cd is too bad to be in stores.This is not rap or hip-hop.This is nothing.Thanks
1,Hillary Duff's alter-ego,"Am I the first to figure this out? The jokes on the paying public - a trashy moron making millions for churning out throw-away tracks with such curious ramblings. White men can't jump. White kids can't rap - apparently. Who cares what this moron has to say?? I had class clowns with more wit in junior high. Pop keeps getting worse; McEminem is proof. Aspiring rappers, hang up your mics - rap is dead."
2,commercial pop music,"Where's the old school hip-hop sound, Em? It's the same stuff as the last album. I miss songs like ""Role Model"" and ""Just don't give a f*ck"". Seems like he only wants sell to the big audience and not the real hip-hop fans. Even my mom likes his songs now. This is general music is for ritch students who play this kind of music on parties not for real hip-hop lovers. Too bad, he's spoiling his talent."
3,"Three and a half, actually...","It's a good album, but to have been a masterpiece as before it would've been a rather short album with the material that is here. The good one's are good, and the bad one's, well, they're bad. You know the album won't be on par with the other's when you hear the first two songs, which are weak. There are though, as I've said, some jewels throughout, just not enough to make a great album as he's done before. There might've been more material if he would've waited a little longer, but it's all about the money in the rap game. To say the least, I think it might be some time before we hear from Marshall Mathers again, which might be a good thing."
3,This was ok................... I guess,"I loved the slim shady and marshall mathers lps i give them both 6/5 stars. I thought that the Eminem show was good, but not as good 5/5. I couldnt wait untill the new album came out. I was even begining to think that he quit going solo and just totally joined d12 (which i like them to) but when eminem raps solo he is outstanding. then this cd came out i thought that just lose it was anoying with the ahaahahaha hah part. all the other songs were ok though but this cd was a quick make of eminem to satisfy his fans, so he just made this without thinkingo well"
3,It's alright,"First let me say that I love Eminem. I have been a huge fan since he came out. This album was very disapointing though. It doesn't even compare to his other three albums. Some songs are good like Never Enough, Like Toy Soldiers, ans Spend Some Time. But most of the other songs are just annoying. He complains about Kim a lot on this album and also is too apologetic. And the album has a lot of burping and farting sound effects that aren't funny but just annoying. He should've worked a little harder on this one."
4,Falls On Deaf Ears With Some Sperts of Greatness,"My overall feeling of the cd was a letdown. However, as like most eminem cds it takes a couple weeks for some of these tracks to hit you. Lyrically a great album, but some of the topics talked about are not very interesting...like in the song ""Puke"". However there are shades of greatness mixed upon the many tracks of this album in ""Mockingbird"" and ""Yellow Brick Road"".My favorite song is ""Love You More"" which is a bonus track that hits home for me and I'm sure will with many who have been in types of relationships like that. On my last note I think if you listen to the tracks longer and interpet the songs harder it will grow on you."
1,Less Than Zero- I Feel Sorry For His Daughter,"Eminem must have spent 20 minutes producing or atleast writing the songs for this crapola of a cd. I can't believe people like this drivel. The cameo by 50 Cent is pathetic too- his STUPID misogynistic lyrics about a ""wannabe actress"" shows just how low the mentality is with these lowlifes. Child Protective Srrvices should snatch Halle away before she grows up to be another immoral burnout."
1,Em fell off,"I hate to say it cuz I am an Eminem fan but this album sucks. The reason I am an Em fan is because of the talent he has constantly displayed in every album...until now. The lyrical talent that propelled Em to the top can hardly be found in this cd. There are only three good songs. I wouldn't recommend buying this cd. Every artist has a bad album and this is his. It's inevitable that he will take more flak for this crap just cuz it's Em but hopefully people will cut him some slack...even the likes of Pac, Nas and Jay-Z had AT LEAST one bad album and I like those guys too. Maybe next time Em..."
1,CCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!,Gosh!!!!!I want to puke and choke on the puke and then die.This is how bad this cd is.
2,ewwwwww,"Okay, I had HUGE expectations for this CD, I was not expecting this. . .I am soooooo dissappointed. Every song sounds the same! There are not catchy songs anymore, and well the only good track is Mosh. Its a new style yeah, and I suppose some people will like it, but I HATE it. Ugh I just LOVED his other stuff, its so dissapointing. I guess Eminem had to grow up or something, but I for one, maybe many, lament this. . ."
1,WORST EMINEM CD EVER,this cd was by far eminems worstThe Beats were HorrendousThe way the lyrics sounded was even worsethere are 2 maybe 3 good songs on herethe Bonus disc only has 3 songs2 of them are decentI personally feel i wasted my money on this cd
1,Crap,"this has to be Eminem's worst Cd, but not only that, it is one of the most annoying CD's i have ever listened to. the lyrics are repetitive and annoying throughout the whole album. when i first heard ""Just Lose It"" on the radio i hated it and i still do, but i hoped that the rest of the CD would not be as bad as that piece of crap. well i was wrong, every other song is even worse. horrible."
1,the Weird Al of Rap,"Eminem is One of the Most overrated Artists Ever. He has a bit of wit&Humor here&there but his Routine has long ago played out. the Production is Corny&He writes so Predictably. He is a Wanna-Be Rebel. that foolishness at Mocking Michael Jackson just shows how little Creativity He truly has. the more I see Eminem the More I long for the days of Vannilla Ice. Eminem thinks He is the Archie Bunker of Music,but in reality he is just a meathead with Marginal Talent."
1,A Complete and Total JOKE.,"Yes, Eminem is a joke. But you know what folks? He doesn't care. He's laughing all the way to the bank. While the youth of America uphold and follow him as some sort of god, Marshall Mathers is laughing and living it up. And all he had to do was shout obscenities and nursery rhymes into a microphone! Maybe I can make a CD too? Nonetheless, it's no wonder that the music industry is self-destructing. They only brought this on themselves, and they deserve their self-inflicted wounds as far as I'm concerned. It's not just Eminem either. 90% of the stock at my local CD store is pure GARBAGE. I say let the RIAA and the music business in general suffer a slow, painful death. I, for one, won't mourn its demise. This type of music is only more proof that society in general is morally bankrupt."
2,How much time did he put into this record,"This album was an upset; a real disappointment. When I think of the track ""Just Lose It"" the only thing I lost was my money! A few songs made the radar like, ""Yellow Brick Road"", ""Toy Soldiers"", ""Mockingbird"", ""We As Americans"" (bonus CD) and ""Ricky Ticky Tock"" (bonus CD). Unlike some of his other Albums, I had no idea what message he was trying to deliver. Maybe it was more of a mix tape approach? He definitely sounds like a Toys ""R"" Us kid with some of his tracks, but I must admit ""Ass Like That"" was hilarious. Anyway, this won't be the album of the year.ONE"
1,LET'S REPEAT ONCE AGAIN,"Oh poor Eminem. Is it that he is losing his imagination or he has nothing more to say? I'm tired of Eminem making fun of other artist, this time he choose Michael Jackson and Madonna to make fun of them. Isn't he tired of talk sh*t about other people. Why doesn't he waste all of his talent in writing some other useful things. Because he has talent, there's no doubt. But this album, all of this songs and writing just have been done before.Buy ""The eminem show"" or ""THe slim shady LP"" instead of this."
4,Gimme an Encore!,"Where to start. I spent the last 6 years listing to Eminem's rivals ICP. I always kept an open mind and checked out all of the Eminem albums and was never impressed. Eminem's Encore is excellent though, to my surprise. I purchased this album after I heard it for the first time. In ""Mosh"", Eminem so openly thrashes George W. Bush, which was needed from somebody the youth could relate to. Other songs such as ""Spend some Time"",""Mockingbird"", ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Encore"" made me a believer that Eminem is good at what he does. This is a definate buy, for all of you who haven't purchased it yet."
5,Eminem is the greatest rapper living. PERIOD!!!,"Everybody has to understand that Eminem is going to be different. He is going to be himself on every album or record. He has lyrics out the ass & beats too! This album is different from any other rap album out this year. It is worth your money. If you can bump Ludacris, Usher, Lil' Jon or Chingy, why not Em. Give the man his respect & give it where it's due. Forget that talk about he's boring & all that other garbage. He's definitely a lyrical legend & this album proves it!"
1,Hey yo,"Hey [...] are you gay or something like that.You see you have only one review so you must be somebody else who already did a review with another nick name and you are posting that review to defend eminem.Do you love him or something like that.You must be gay just like him and the cd suck.Eminem is just a 15min superstar.He's been in the game for 4 years and he is already finished.He can't rap no more.He's done.He's not like other rappers such as, Dr.Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Warren G etc. that been able to stay in the game for more than 10 years always doing hot CD's.He uses line from other rappers and he as done nothing for the hip-hop world.[...].He can't rap and I shouldn't be producing 2pac albums.2Pac wouldn't like him if is still alive.Eminem youre done.RIP 2PAC AND B.I.G."
1,Garbage,"This is one of the worst albums I've heard in a while. When is he gonna stop making these retarded a** songs like Just Lose It and Big Weenie? If his whole album was full of songs like Mosh and serious s**t like that, maybe I would give him more than one star. And for those of you who believe this B.S. that Eminem is the best rapper, obviously you've never listened to a real rapper like Jay-Z. Em's got talent, but he ain't got nothing on Jay-Z. None of Em's albums compare to The Black Album. Get off this white boy's d**k."
1,"0 stars... this ""music"" is dumb... just dumb.","This guy is talentless. He's on MTV yet mocks MTV. Hypocrite. He writes songs about himself and how hard his life is/was. Redundant. He writes songs about people that don't like him/he doesn't like. Boring. The songs are stale, the beats are wannabe, and the voice/lyrics are really stupid. Eminem is for kids who don't know any better. If you are an adult and you own Eminem, shame on you.Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured, talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each ""song"". Please throw away your Eminem material. Don't sell it, just toss it."
2,Where did Eminem go,"A large shift in eminem's flow resulted in a dissapointing album. He reached his peak with the Eminem Show, but this album shows signs of a downfall. His rhyming style seems different and not as solid as before. This album was hard to get into and cannot be taken as seriously as the previous three. Some songs are decent , never enough, like toy soldiers, just lose it, and mosh being the best. After listening to this album one can only hope that shady makes atleast one more album that displays the talents of the old eminem."
1,Stupid. Hectic. Idiotic. Terrible.,"I used to really like him when he was in D12. Yah, they were a fun band, but now, Eminem and his horrible rapping hit the spotlight. I mean, come on! ""Ass Like That""? ""You make my slinky go DOING DOING DOING""?????? C'mon Em. You can do much better than this.PS. About my name. S.H.I.T. Get it? lol anyways, trust my review."
1,thanks for selling out marshall,"www.realmusiccrusaders.com - fighting to save music for the sake of arteminem has an incredible flow. i find it amazing how he can rhyme the middle of word with the next word and he can use very interesting rhyming patterns. well thats about all thats good about him...and im not even talking about his deplorable lyric content! no, we're talking about the fact that eminem has completely sold out. everytime you turn on MTV you see him and he is trying to sell himself or one of his ""artists"" from his label. we feel that he has stopped evolving. he continually writes about his mom and his daughter. yea we know...you hate your mom and love your daughter. WHO CARES GIVE ME SOMETHING OF INTEREST (and no, rapping about Benzino and the source doesn't make you interesting, it makes you well marketed product!) this album proves that his formula is still working for some unknown reasondont forget www.realmusiccrusaders.com - fighting to save music for the sake of art"
1,The guide to making your very own Eminem CD!,"Ever sit around and think ""Hey! I wish I could be cool and make a CD, just like Eminem!"" No? Well, I'm going to tell you how anyway! Just follow these steps, and you can make an Eminem CD of your very own!1. Have a song making fun of someone (Michael Jackson is popular these days)2. Include a song about how much you love your ex-wife3. A song about how much you hate your ex-wife4. A song about how much you love your daughter5. A song that tries to convey a good message, but fails miserably6. A song that tries to be funny but fails miserably7. A song whining about your poor childhood8. A song about how much you hate your Mom9. A song about how much you love your Mom10. Another song crying about your childhood11. A song about how hard it is on the streets12. Make a couple filler tracks to add lengthThat's it, kids! Now you TOO can be a cool mainstream rapper like Eminem! Good luck, whitey!"
2,Will the real Slim Shady please step aside,"I really like Shady I have all his cd's and love them all except this one.This is just horrible,i first read other peoples reviews first but it didnt matter i still bought it should have listened to the other reviewers complaints.This album has no substance,where that Em.spirit,anger,attitude what ever it is his had in the past.There is only a couple of good songs on here one you have probaly heard 1000 times on radio already,its time for shady to step aside and let Buck,50,and Banks take over album releases while shady produces like Dr.Dre does now with some cameo's in some songs I just believe Eminem has run out of material...Really how long can all his songs be either about Kim,Hailey,his mom or his srewed up past,it was intresting the first few go arounds now its just old..."
1,1 song only!,What a horrible album this was! I would only buy it if you wanted a good song wich was Just Lose It. That was the only good song on this cd!!!
2,What happend?!,"Slim, you dissapoint. Aside from about 2 or 3 songs (like Toy Soldiers) the album is filled with lame, unoriginal, songs that lack in both content and presentation (Big Weenie - c'mon dude, for real?). That's right, some of Em's rhymes on this album just kinda suck, and his style actually used to be good, back in the day...Oh and Mosh sounds like a political-message rap song that at a point in time maybe had some substance but for whatever reason got turned into a dumbed-down political message for the ""general audience"", who don't even really like/get it. Seriously, Mosh was shady's big chance to expand into a new direction with his music but instead he delivers at half-effort.After ripping Toy Soldiers and some other track I gave away this CD to a friend. There's good quality hip-hop out there but Encore isn't it."
1,"Disappointing, immature, regressive","Dear oh dear - what happened here? I've liked most of Em's prior work, and he appeared to be heading in a positive direction culminating in the brilliant 'Lose Yourself'. But what happened here? It's like the progressive improvement never happened - he's back at square one.Musically, it's all rather uninspiring. Much less variation than his more recent work, and uncompelling hooks. Where are the 'Stans' on this album? There's not one song with a beat that incites you to hit the 'replay track' button.Vocally, it's all over the place (and I do wish he wouldn't try and sing - it's rather painful). Lyrically, it's disastrous. I thought the boy might have been maturing after listening to 8 Mile. But this album is full of juvenile crudeness that is neither amusing, nor shocking - just rather pathetic.If you have nothing to say, Mister Mathers, I suggest you remain quiet."
1,One of the worst albums I ever heard!,"Don't even download this crap, Em has hit rock bottom although I thought he was never that great begin with, there's something wrong with you if you think this is hot, I suggest that you check out KRS-ONE's ""Keep Right"" album instead if you want a recent quality hip-hop album."
1,What happened here?,"Eminem's previous 3 albums were each increasingly better, but Encore is just a complete failure, don't buy it. I gave this album many chances and tried to like it, but the sound effects and music are unlistenable. If you want get into Eminem, check out The Eminem Show, Marshall Mathers LP, or Slim Shady LP instead."
2,"If the effort was there, it doesn't show...","I'd first off like to say i'm a pretty big eminem fan but this album was just kinda weird. and not in a good way. i see reviews on here saying that they are glad eminem still has his way with words but i just don't see it on this one. it seemed like he was just rambling on without any real direction. which i guess some might say that's what he does but it just wasn't there on encore. The bottom line - The beats were bland and his rhymes, with the exception of a few tracks, were almost non existent."
2,God help us all,"I am a big music fan, and like rap (well good rap), but this is where i draw the line, this is not crap, but this is not good this is redundant as you may have already figured i mean he just says the same thing. My biggest annoyance is my first single with the diss on christopher reeves, how can anyone even like eminem after that for god sakes the man is dead has been through more trauma then anyone really and he sits there in his nice clothes and able to walk around and disses this man thats all i can say. And then to show you the talent listen to the song ""big weenie"" where he talks about that he doesnt have to look at a paper that he can say what he thinks well i counted like 15 seconds about someone having bad breath and tooth decay thats got to be the dumbest thing i have ever heard and to just let you know the only reason he really sells albums is some talent but more that he is white now and a pop icon other then that he has lost talent and all respect that i had for him"
1,Is it over yet?,"I hope this is Eminem's last album, but I had hoped his first album would be his last. Evil Deeds is good, the rest is downright ugly. If you want REAL rap, go with Run-DMC, an example of rap BEFORE it died."
2,Very Disappointing,"Oh well, the wait continues for a good eminem album. I can't understand how such an intelligent and gifted guy can't get it together for his own album. He did great work producing for other artists such as 2pac, Jay-Z, Nas and Jadakiss but for some reason he forgets how to produce for himself. I was never such an Eminem fan but i really thought this album would be different but again it's bland, boring and repetetive. The only 2 good tracks here are Rain Man and Just Lose It with the latter being good simply because the lyrics are so funny, only Em could get away with it. But as usual this album will go multi platinum but it really doesn't deserve to. Maybe next time he'll improve. We'll have to wait and see i guess."
1,"Em this, and Em that! I beat Eminen with a wiflle bat.","I see all the good reviews this piece of trash album its getting and its obvious that there are too many white boys in this site. This album is pure thrash!! He is not the greatesh rapper of all time, and he will never be!! He's had a few good songs, but thats it. ""You people"" do something a little bid right and want to make it the greatest ever."
1,This cd [...]. Really.,I have been waiting for this cd to come out and am so disappointed. The bets and lyrics are weak. Eminem is either talking about his ex girl or [...] remarks. listening to the remarks make you wonder about him. I CAN RECORD 21 OR 22 DIFFERENT FARTS AND PUT THEM ON A CD AND IT WILL SOUND BETTER THAN THE ENCORE CD!
5,Here we go again,"Snip it and stab it you professional savants and degredational bearers of no forthought. Remeber you speak to the ""cattle"" and they listen to you like some clandestine leader of the same social impediment of depravity and desired lawyer'd wit. Untill you grow the hell out of all of it. Talk about Eminem maturing... what a condescention you pedistled nit wits.You really need to listen to this album. Its subtlties as much as it expected crashes. You reviewers an critics surely haven't listened to it enough.This man is an animal, alive and well fed. Eminem might have become to good for a blood thirsty, two second attention span ADD time stamp, that needs something to please it as instantly as Mcdonalds food or heroin ... Its all because you've sold out to the idea of the generation of excess and are happy there where you can please the fascade.Eminem... You rock."
2,Will the Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up!!!,"Aside from the Yankees blowing a 3-0 lead against the Red Sox this album is the biggest disappointment of the year. This album is a weak effort by the best rapper out there and is a major letdown. Eminem went soft on this album and fails to do what he does best which is stir up controversy and make hilarious rhymes. The only person he manages to offend on this album is Michael Jackson and that's already been done. I think the problem was that Dre did not have enough input into this CD since he only produced half the tracks on it. These are the best songs on the album including my favorite Encore featuring Dre himself. When Eminem laces the track all you get is a weak beat complete with fart noises, burps and puking. Hopefully bad reviews like this one causes Eminem to elevate his rhymes and be the great rapper that he is. I look forward to new Eminem albums and hope that he doesn't go out with this weak CD."
2,Slim Shady Where ARE You?,"This album is so terrible it leads one to the theory that it is intentional. I mean, listen to Just Don't Give A F***, Rock Bottom, and Brain Damage from his first album, and then Puke, Mosh, Ass Like That from Encore and the difference is obvious. This is passionless music. If you want a passionate Eminem, check out ""Straight from the Lab"". Em is either saving his best for the bootleggers, or has gone off the deep end. I truly want to believe it is the former."
2,no im sorry,"ive got all em's albums ,they were all off the hook, but this ones just not there ,the first 3 i was instantly hooked, i might get used to this in time but its not on the level we are used to hearing from the man, he's got all his shady artists on here, 50, obie, d12, all i can say is rap is just gettin worse, some one should save it, krs one, public enemy etc should drop another bomb before 'rap' turns into watered down pop, some of you will love it but not me"
2,Time to Move On,"I loved ""The Eminem Show"" and could not wait to get my hands on the follow up. Now that I have it I am wish I would have waited longer.Eminem gives us new material from a musical standpoint, but its the same old thing regarding the lyrics. O.K., you had a bad childhood, you hate your father, your wife Kim was a drag, and until Dr. Dre came along your career in music was going nowhere. Been there, done that.This effort gives the Eminem fan nothing new to grasp on to. Nothing fresh, no inspiration, no reason to listen more then once. We have heard this story before. Might be time to retire your jersey."
1,I can't believe people actually enjoy this,"This album is terrible. This is below below what Eminem's standards should be. A couple good songs and a funny skit should't sell 4 million copies in the first week. Eminem needs to learn he can't sing. 'Mockingbird' would've been good without it. 'Spend Some Time' would've been good without it. Everything would be better without it. Dre's production is TERRIBLE. Nothing special from him. Nothing special from Eminem. Stat Quo is wack. 50 Cent sounds dumber than ever (""She says she is an inspiring actress""). Bland, bland stuff."
1,Horrible... pure trash,"Eminem was on the top of his game on his sophomore album the marshall mathers lp. Since then his music has declined into one of the most monotonous and poorly produced albums i have heard. As a big eminem fan, i was extremely let down by this album... it's just not good. His first single 'just lose it' has none of the ingenuity of the singles from his previous albums and feels churned out last minute so that he can attract the mtv audience... the lyrics he spits just don't sound like the eminem that broke new ground with The Slim Shady LP. Maybe he's getting tired..but his lyrics just arent as satirical and fast paced as they once were. This album just seems as though eminem doesnt care anymore and just wants to make more money."
2,Bummed At Shady,It's really hard to defend this CD. I listened to it about 10 times to give it a chance 'cuz some cds you gotta give time. But this is just stupid. There's a few good moments but out of 23 tracks I like maybe 3- that is a bad ration 3 of 23!
3,Where is the REAL SLIM SHADY?,"I was horribly dissappointed. Eminem is my favorite rapper, and arguably the best rapper in the game. It seems he's given up multi-syllibly rhymes all together. I guess that he's tired of being held to a higher standard than other rappers, and figures that he shouldn't make the effort. I want my money back."
3,Sorry,I'm not feeling this album the 3rd was the best because he let himself go. This 4th album is too much of a joke get Jeff Foxworthy instead.
1,To the FANBOY below...,"Just STOP listening to music altogether. PLEASE, PLEASE JUST STOP SMOKING HIS POLE AS WELL, ITS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN YOUR REVIEW.To everyone else, listen to all of Eminem's albums before this one. Actually you probably have unless you live in a bubble.That is all."
1,Wow.,"So I have absolutley loved Eminem since back in the day when he first realeased is first album. I think Eminem has completley forgot why people orignially liked him...he was different. Now, he is exactly like every other rapper, only rapping about money, girls and the such. It's really quite sad that he has deteriorated so much, if he wants a remote chance at saving his career he should really go back to being crazy Slim Shady again."
5,.............WOW,"""Encore"" Eminem's newest cd, I think is the best cd he ever made. Most people writing reviews of here are all saying some stupid stuff about him changing his style and flow but its not really changed. His songs are a little different than his old ones but they are still mad hot. Out of 23 songs on this cd, 22 are good. Some serious songs and some really funny songs. All the beats are crazy on most of the songs. I think this album will sell a lottt of copies ever since people herd Just Lose It and Mosh. Should you buy this cd?..............hell yea. Go and get it now becuase you get a limited time offer bonus cd that has 3 unreleased songs. Go...Buy...NOW"
3,I liked it....yet......,"I liked the album....some of the songs were really good. My favorites right now are just lose it, mockingbird and ass like that. However, I must admit its not as good as any of his other albums. Unless you really like eminem....maybe borrow it from someone before you go out and buy it."
4,Eminem's Best Album since the Marshal Mathers LP,"Look, I've been reading a lot of reviews of this CD online and people are missing the point of this album. Someone on amazon.com cited that Em plays Triumph the comic dog on ""Ass Like That."" While Eminem mentions Triumph, he's clearly taking on the persona of an Iraqi whose home is being invaded. Eminem just pulls out Triumph beccause it's a song and it's easy for him to cop out that way. To think that he's playing the entire song as Triumph is ridiculous. A new Eminem album will always be under the microscope at release, so it's obvious that people will disagree about this CD. I seriously think that Em's rapping is at it's prime on this album as well as the Self and Dre produced tracks. He's not going to rehash the same things that are on his previous albums. Instead, it's as if he's come to terms with his taciturn past and this album is summation of the artist's career. A benchmark album for Eminem with, hopefully, more to come."
1,oh..no!..not..again,"so why dont the king of rap just retire..by the time im typing this one im extremely tired after hearing this terrible album..i wonder wat kinda music is this in a world of britney and brian adams ?i think eminem is cracking up and he must consult a psychiartist before beginning his next album for the sake of his fans..the track puke,just lose it ..and its video proves his insanity..og guys im telling u from the deepest end of ma heart that..""PLEASE DONT BUY THIS ALBUM""..if u really wanna buy this one buy at ur own risk!!"
1,over rated,"dont get me wrong slim shady can rap to be a white guy.but to us blacks he says some really stupid flows.n-syncis gone fred durst is gone britney and christina are both falling off j-lo aint with puffy, mosh came out to late.hedont have no one to make fun of exept for micheal jacksonhe all ways talk about some one who cant defend them self lyically he hasent dissed jay-z and he knows he better not say any thing about bone crusher!"
1,Break It To The Pitiful Fans,"First, I wake up everyday wondering how Eminem maintains a fan base of many. But then I tell myself, ""well, a lot of the population is delusional and tastless as well as....stupid."" So then I say, that's definetly his crowd.How can a man like Eminem crtiicze Michael Jackson: The man who is the biggest selling artist of all time. Michael Jackson, who has higher standards. Michael Jackson, who is idolized by many...and yet Eminem said that he STILL idolizes Michael Jackson.Eminem says Michael is a genius, a legend, and has gone through a lot of $hit. Is he just hypocritical? He bashes a legend, a genius, the man he idolized? He wants to add to more of this B.S MJ is persisting through?Eminem, you have low standards, and maybe that's why your records sales are decreasing, and your fan base is weakening. I went to your official site, and I have seen many of your loyal fans turn on you. Sad Eminem, you crossed the line of trying to be controversial in order to sell records."
5,The best album of all time!,This album is simply incredible! 5 stars is not enough for this masterpiece!
3,it's OK,"I only like 3 songs on the album. The part where he talks about Christopher Reeve is very very cruel. The best part of the album is only 1 second long... it's a cool little sound effect that sounds like he's rewinding the tape. And I guess Yellow Brick has about 30 seconds of a real cool rhyme. So the album has 31 seconds of good stuff on it. The rest is recycled stuff, with a few cool parts. Oh, and if you a teenager you might think of his attempts at humor are funny."
1,ROFLROFLROFLROFLROFLROFLROFL,"OMG IT'Z M-N-M!!!111!1111!!!!OMG THEZ ALBUM R0X0RZ!111!!111!!!!!11!1111D00D, LIEK WUN TIEM, I HERD THEZ ALBUMN CUZ MY HOMIE DOWNLOADED IT FRUM TEH INTARWEB!!11!!!!OMG, THEZ ALBUM RAWKS!!!!1!!EMINEM IZ TEH MOST TALENTED GUY EVAR!!!1!!11LAWL!!!!111KKLOL!!!!11!!!!1SO N-EWAYZ, CHECK OUT THEZ ALBUM, N SEE 4 URSELF WHY PPL LUV IT!!!!!!IT RAWKZ!!1111!!!!!!!!1!oKey oKey!11!!!!1Actually, Eminem is nothing but a little scrawny white boy who talks too much. Keepin' it real, yo."
3,BUNCH OF FU**ING IDIOTS,"YOU ARE ALL (MOST OF YOU) A BUNCH OF FU**ING QU*ERS!!! THE CD WAS GOOD, NOT GREAT, BUT GOOD. THIS IS SIMPLY EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD BAD SONGS, GOOD SONGS, AND A FEW GREAT SONGS. CALLING IT GARBAGE MEANS YOU HAVE AS MUCH TASTE IN MUSIC AS PARIS HILTON HAS IN GUYS. AS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THINK EMINEM IS BAD FOR SOCIETY. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ME AND MANY OTHERS WHEN I SAY SUCK A FAT DI*K. AMERICA IS A FREE COUNTRY AND IT MAY BE PLAGUED WITH A FEW BAD THINGS, BUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS NOT ONE OF THEM AND IT IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO STOP BIT*HING ABOUT. IF YOUR GAY AND YOU CRY ABOUT EMINEM SPEAKING HIS MIND, REALIZE THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS PART OF AMERICA AND SO IS THE ABILITY OF BEING A QUE*R SO EITHER STOP BITCHING ABOUT IT OR GOT TO PAKISTAN AND GET KILLED FOR BEING A F*G!!!"
3,What Happend?,"What Happened? It seems Em has lost his Unique style and flow on this album. I mean theres sum tight tracks on this disk but over all it seems Half A$$'d. It sounds like the cd was done in a hurry and not much time was spent on it. Maybe its because all the drama Em has to put up w/ in his life....Or has he lost his touch? I'm hoppin he'll make a come back on his next album. Cuz this just doesnt feel like Em. He can do better than this! And what tha F*ck was he thinkin when he wrote ""Puke"" and ""Bi Weenie""?"
2,Disappointing,"Eminem no longer knows Eminem,musically that is.Or so this project says.It is fragmented,scattered and schizoid songwriting and producing at its worst.Where is the creativity of THE WAY I AM or MY NAME IS...?Nothing close to that will find here."
2,"A decent album, but it's not Eminem...","It seems to me like Eminem was castrated after finishing the Marshall Mathers LP. This new album is just a bunch of lullabies and love songs. The bonus cd had 3 songs on it, and they were better than any song on the actual album. I was hoping that Eminem would redeem himself after the Eminem Show, but i was wrong. I listen to a song like ""Criminal"" from The Marshall Mathers Lp, and it just destroyes any song from the new album. Eminem NEEDS to make another album like the Marshall Mathers LP. That was by far his best album, and no album since then has been able to touch it. I can't believe that I waited in anticipation for 2 YEARS for this album. Way to blow it, Eminem."
1,Glad you got your wallaroo back,"Well, I'm happy to see that Vanilla Ice has reunited with his wallaroo. Apparently, he just came out with THIS album and it's selling millions. It's good to see Vanilla back in the public spotlight and he's finally selling records again! Welcome back Mr. Ice!"
1,SUCKS,"EMINEM SUCKS. HE IS THE WORST RAPPER EVER. ALL YOU FOOLS RATING THIS WELL HAVE NO IDEA. THIS AINT HIP-HOP, ITS RECYCLED JUNK. IF YOU LIKE THIS YOU SHOULD KILL YOURSELF. HE IS COMPLETELY UNORIGINAL, HAS NOTHING TO HIS LYRICS, AND THE BEATS ARE THE SAME OLD RECYCLED JUNK. IF YOU LIKE THIS THEN DONT CALL YOURSELF A RAP/HIP-HOP FAN - COZ YOUR NOT. YOU ARE A POP FAN."
2,Very Very Disappointing,"What The F**k is this?Oh a Rap Album, you must be kidding me,Really ok since i have to give my opinion i will give one.This Album is probably one of the worst, or ""The Worst"" rap album of all time.I'm not Hating just look at rappers likes Pac,Biggie,Nas,AZ etc. and tell me that this is rap.Eminem if you ever get to read this i want you to know your old albums like ""Marshall Matthers LP"" was great but this one is simply bad.Ok finally, i have to say all the songs in this album is just purely C R A P, so why the 2 stars only because of ""Toy Soilders"" the only song which is good, my advice is if you want to buy this album for this one song give it a go, but i recommend you buy Az,Nas or Rakim it will be much worth it.Peace.."
2,Get off the stage.,"This is a pitiful release from an artist who is capable of much more. There are maybe 3 or 4 songs worth listening to in this whole deal. While production is pretty much there, Eminem seems not to care about the lyrics. He whips them off in various styles, but they, for the most part, sound like he's rambling about whatever topic. It's as it he's not even trying as all on this one. Skip it."
2,What was he thinking???????,"I am a big Eminem fan but I dont know what he was thinking with this one.He shows alot of lyrical talent on Yellow Brick Road, Mosh, Like Toy Soldiers,Never Enough and We as Americans.Its his worst album since the Slim Shady Lp.If he doesn't step it up maybe fans wont ask for an Encore!!!!!!"
5,OK I'm Just Here To...,"Hello, I am one of the producers of the newest rap phenomenon, B-Melch. This 7-man trio, some white and some black, will be releasing a CD sometime soon. I can not yet tell you the release date. They do not have any information on them, we are keeping them an almost complete secret. Their CD will not be on Amazon, it will be a rarity. I will be sending some people their first single ""Pork Soda"" that comes with info on the band. One of the members was in a band that you might have heard of."
4,As good as the Eminem Show,"This cd is just as good as the Eminem Show. Some people didn't like Eminem Show, so probably wont like Encore either. If you liked the Eminem Show cd, you will like Encore."
3,Just OK,"What a great time it was in 2004. My friends turned 21, the Boston Red Sox won a World Series, and Eminem dropped a new album. While this album was a good quick-fix, it's far from the Slim Shady LP and Marshall Mathers LP.Just Lose It is a hilarious 'cuz it's Eminem being as goofy as he ever has been. That third track is intense, but I wish he could've done another verse on that sing, instead of 50 Cent. But props for the Nate Dogg cameo.The last song on the album is intense too. Dr. Dre helps the song a lot. Great beat.The rest of the album has OK songs and a lotta filler.Overall, buy this album at the reduced ""used"" price. Don't pay full price for it. It's good for your collection, just because it makes it more well-rounded."
2,Hardly an 'Encore',"Encore; an album that was supposedly composed in 2 weeks by Eminem, really shows a lack of effort. I can't consider this album, as a whole, 'music'.He gave his fans what they wanted--- an updated Slim Shady-- and, they got him. Too bad Eminem has matured too much to take on this persona again, and produced 'potty-humor' that only his daughter, Hailey Jade (see 'Mockingbird') can laugh at.I gave this album 3 stars (as 2.5 stars isn't selectable), because half of the songs on this album are bearable. However, the 'mature' Eminem showcases some brilliant lyrical talent, like 'Yellow Brick Road' and 'Never Enough'. I find Eminem is a better storyteller now than he is a comedian. Hopefully when (or if) Eminem produces another album, he'll come to his senses and drop the fact that he's not funny anymore.Those who have listened to this album would agree that if Eminem had released this album as his first, his success would be non-existent.I don't think that this album is worth the buy."
2,Eminem - Encore,"After a 2 year break from Eminem Show, Eminem releases this less than average album.The lyrics on this album fail pretty bad on most tracks, but are really good on some others. Tracks that are lyrically good are ""Yellow Brick Road"", ""Like Toy Soldiers"", ""Spend Some Time"", ""Mockingbird"" and that's really it in my opinion.The beats, its half and half like above. Good beats are ""Like Toy Soldiers"", ""Spend Some Time"", ""Mockingbird"", ""Encore.Overall, Eminem just wasn't hungry on this album. A few good tracks, followed by a pretty good flock of mediocre tracks just doesn't equal up the first two albums Em released. Hopefully he'll release something better in the future.My Top 5 Songs1.Yellow Brick Road2.Like Toy Soldiers3.Spend Some Time4.Mockingbird5.Encore"
1,"EMINEM IS DESTROYING THE ""MUSIC"" WORLD",Oh how sad he can't get through a single ''song'' without cussing 50 million times. The only good song is Mockingbird.
1,Limp,"Yo Slim Shady the lyrical wit is reeeeeal slim on this wackjob of an album. Dude, didn't anyone have the courage to say, ""Em, dude, this cd is whack. Maybe ya better record some more songs."" And Em musta said, ""Nah, my dumb little fans will buy anything I puke out!"". There was a time when his hyper rapping style and goofiness was entertaining but now it's just annoying. It's time for someone else to get the attention you got. ""Rain Man"", ""Puke"", ""As- Like Taht"", ""Just Lose It"", all whack. Yeah ""Toy Soldiers"" is a'ight and there's a few moments but for 20 songs it's like trying to find a cashew in a mountain of sh-t."
2,Has a couple of good tracks but rest are weak.,I guess I am expecting to much but I feel like for the money I should get a solid cd. What I do not understand is how D12 and 50 cent are produced so well and Eminem comes off like this.
1,Hes going backwards..,"I loved eminem when he first came out, i thought of him as a rap genius with gracious catchy lyrics, however hes gone nothing but down hill.. his insults and dry humor can only be good for one album.. he needs to find a new method of getting peoples attention and keeping the fans hes lost on the way,this latest album sounds more like an explicit Barney and friends album.. with what seems like a 10 year old nagging and dragging on the same subject track after track.. GARBAGE pure GARBAGE- I expected so much more from eminem, i only hope he can redeem himself"
4,Fair Unbiased Review,"Ill be honest, this is not Eminems best cd and i have heard and own every song he's ever done...from infinite to encore. This cd is probably on par with the Eminem Show but his first two cd's may never be topped so its not a major concern. Fans of the first two cd's may not appreciate his new style but honestly, the more i listen to it the more the cd grows on me, Tracks like: Evil Deeds, Mockingbird and Puke, show great lyrical prowess with a great flow. Most people love it, some hate it but in the end, this is a quality album that most rappers should shoot for. By the way Jakko(mj) is wakko (guilty)"
2,Biggest Dissapointment Ever,"i honestly couldn't bare to listen to more then half the songs on that album...its not that it just wasn't his best album it was his absolute worst. he made a song about dissing a pupet. what hurts is that songs like toy soldier, love you more, and we as americans showed that Em still had the ability to do groundbreaking work but he just chose not to"
1,"He sings like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic","On the very annoying songs where Em tries to sing the hooks, he actually sounds alot like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. A friend of mine pointed that out to me, and a seriously is true. But it's not a compliment, it's shows how bad the songs on this cd are.I just think this cd is mostly depressing and where Em tries to be funny he just isn't. There is a lot of gross stuff on some songs and I'm not being a prude I just don't want to listen to Em taking a dump while talking on the phone. It just isn't entertaining. And there are other things like farting and throwing up that sound disgusting. Some reviewers are saying Em has ""grown up"" and gotten mature but I mean how mature is this unneeded ""humor""?I thought ""Just Lose It"" was the worst first single from any of his cds. But now after listening to the whole album I think ""Just Lose It"" is one of the better songs. Not saying much. Em's rapping on some of these songs is just lazy and uninventive."
4,Encore,"Pretty good album, lots of variety even within the realm of Eminem. Silly, serious, offensive and intense- a good mix. There are only two or three songs I regularly skip past while listening to the whole album, and 3/20 isn't so bad!"
5,Ace Reporter,"In this age of rip-and-read anchor persons, it's startling to confront an example of an earlier age when reporters were journalists. Robert Casey is a journalist's journalist, perhaps the best writer of any who covered WWII. He frequented both European and Pacific battlefields to report the human face of what he saw. In this book, he records events and experiences from the European theater from early in the American entry into the war to the expulsion of the last German armies from France. Covering Atlantic convoys, motor torpoedo boats in the Channel, the D-Day invasion, the breakout from the Hedgerows, the liberation of Paris, he writes with both intense human involvement and the reporter's eye for detail. He was there, and he makes you feel that you are there. There's nothing like him nowadays; our loss."
5,All this and Podles too!!!,"As a Fillenatic I can recommend this highly. Very funny production with the marvelous Ewa Podles being a wonderful comedienne and treats us to some of her extreme notes from bass to coloratura!!! Great imagination went into the final scene with all sorts of strange guests I had never seen in other productions. Good idea I think as the last act is pretty short and this gives it a bit more body. Kelly is a bit light vocally, but is OK, and looks very good. Devia is always very good vocally. Maybe a bit stiff early on......but she warms up pretty well for the last act."
1,No sense of fun,"I'm a lover of this particular opera - but I recommend anyone who would like a copy of ""Daughter of the Regiment"" to seek out older versions done by the New York City Opera. Or that marvelous version by Beverly Sills at Wolf Trap. La Scala has practically turned this opera into Opera Seria! There's absolutely no sense of fun at all in it."
5,cool,i have v1 my sister has 2 v2 and the batteries alwayz run out but pretty fun to play with. i am 13 and my sister is 11 and we like to connect. there kinda girly but when i have to watch my sister it gives use something to do.
4,A WHOLE NEW FAMILY TO FIT IN,"This virtual toy will teach your chilldren responsibility and what caring is all about. I love my tamagotchi!!! This toy is good for 6-15 year olders. You will go through a whole bunch of generations in just one little set. so i suggest you buy a tamagotchi for your children asap. If you need to know how to use the tamagotchis go to www.tamagotchiconnections.com,tamas make wonderfull birthday presents!ps. This perticular tama you are looking at is a really rare type and has a really cool color."
5,A nine year old girl's review.,"In version two you can get Pyoncotchi and Mesutchi!(The other Tamagotchi version.)There is over 60 characters! I have 2 tamagotchis. One version 1 and version 2. Although my chain broke easily,I still like this a lot! The best part is the shopping on it! It is a very fun and awesome!!"
5,Tamagotchi,I may not have one but my friends lend me it and thier really fun youcould turn off the volume shop play games and have lot's of generations.
4,Tamagotci pretty fun,Me and my sister went to toys r us to buy a tamagotci when we got home we played with it for a little while. We liked it but we were expecting it to be more fun.It does not do much stuff all you can do is ask it to play a game and a lot of times it says no.But other than that it was pretty fun. We also think that its sort of expensive for such a small toy.Thank you for reading my review.
5,Big Time Fun in San Diego!!,Our daughter (age: 11) had the original Tamagotchi and wanted the new version 2. We went to Toys R Us and they were sold out. So we went on line and she got to choose the exact one she wanted. She has thoroughly enjoyed connecting the two together and with her friends. It's amazing how many different things you can do with it. It's a very social toy and teaches responsibility as well. We highly recommend one or two. They make a great birthday gift!
1,Buy the new game boy micro or ds insted,Parents if you are looking for a gift for your 12 year old son/daughter i highly advise you to NOT BUY THIS TOY! When version 2 came out me and every one else in my 6th grade class really wanted one eso me and all my friends got together and went on over to toys r us and bought the last ones they had. When we got back to my friend shays house and started to play them we were extremly disapointed The chain broke off the second it left the package AND they were extremly boring.So if you want to buy your child something that they will really truly enjoy i reconmend either the gameboy ds or the gameboy micro both of witch provid hours of fun!Thank you for taking the time to read my review.
3,Almost Great,"This toy is not my fav, but also O.K. I have the same one. But it beeps way too much. :("
5,Tamagotchi FUN,Although it is hard to take care of....it is sooo much fun to have your tomagotchi fall ihn love.
4,TaMaGoTcHi TiTle,I think this toy is good for 2 reasons:1.It is educational2. it teaches responsibilityI also think its bad for 1 reason:1. My cousin had a tamagotchi and at school one of her friends connected and the other one ran in to it with a knife.
1,the biggest waste,the batterys run out so fast and after a month ofuse it starts waring out I now I have 4 kids andthay all have them.
1,AGREED. Do not buy!,I purchased this at a charity auction 18 months ago. Tonight noticed the clicking sound of death! I will get my brother to try the fix set out herein. Amazing...
1,Impressive to begin with......,"Had two of these, one for my dad, and one for me, we were both quite happy for 13 months or so (does that mean I got a good one compared to the other reviews here!)Standard problem listed here with the board and the cooling, occurred on mine one week, the very next week my dads failed.What a piece of Junk."
1,Good while it lasted,My vt-12 died after a little over a year - same ticking sound from the control board that others have reported.
1,Died in 10 months,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I received it for Christmas from my boyfriend and it died today. (October 15!) Customer service told me the same thing, 90 day warrantee, I have to pay $45 to replace the control board and have to sodder (sp?) the wires into the board when I replace it... Since I can't even spell the word, how can they expect me to know how to fix it? This is a terrible company, and I wish we had read this review list when he bought it! This Christmas I will wish for a legit wine fridge!"
1,"Nice little cooler, but factor in an extra $34.95 + shipping","If you are looking for an affordable wine cooler, this one is pretty nice looking, but while price shopping just factor in an extra $34.95 + shipping for the control board that you will need to buy within the next year to replace the control board that is nearly guaranteed to fail. No reason not to expect the replaced control board to fail after another year too. I'd be interested to know how many control board units Vinotemp is selling vs. how many actual wine coolers they are selling. Maybe I would be less annoyed if they considered the control board a wearable part and sold it on the shelf right next the unit itself."
1,Fix Controller Board Yourself!,"VT-12TEDi stopped working after about six months; the common ticking sound from the controller board. After a little research, I found the 16V 1000uF 16mmx10mm capacitor (silver and black can) on the board (upper right corner) was bad. Visual indications are the typical ""popped"" top of the capacitor can. I purchased a higher quality replacement capacitor for less than $1 and replaced it. It was a very easy soldiering job that most people with a pencil iron could do. The unit works great now and I don't expect it to go out again anytime soon."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Mine broke about four months after I bought it. Instead of cooling my wines it heated them to over 90 degrees! Two bottles were ruined.The company's warantee is only good for 90 days. I called and they said tough luck, not their problem. They do NOT stand by their product."
1,The power supply died after one year,"This wine cooler worked okay for a while. The temperature went up after a few months, but that was easily fixed by cleaning the dust out of the filter on the back. Unfortunately, this week the power supply died, and now the cooler doesn't work anymore. It only makes clicking noises when plugged in. I'm not sure if I should buy a new power supply from Vinotemp because this problem seems to be quite common."
1,"Never stayed at correct temperature, stopped working after a year","Almost immediately, it was unable to keep the temperature at which I set it. It hovered around 55 instead of 50. When our home was warmer, the unit generally stayed around 70 degrees even though it was set to 50.After about a year, it stopped displaying the temperature, and the main control board started making a clicking noise instead of turning on. It no longer functions, and repair is more expensive than the original price of the unit. Like other reviewers commented, the product only had a 90 day warranty."
2,Vinotemp 12TEDi,"This wine cooler lasted about a year, and then quit, emitting a chirping sound. I took the back cover off, and could see a green and a red LED flashing as the unit chirped. I removed the electronics board and replaced the 1000 microfared capacitor (the old one was bulged and damaged). The unit is now working properly again. Apparently, the board has weak components, as I read about this solution from others."
1,DON'T BUY THIS COOLER!!!,HAD THIS COOLER FOR ONE YEAR AND IT STOPPED WORKING. CALLED COMPANY AND THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT EVEN BEFORE I TOLD THEM WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. I GUESSTHEY HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE. WANTED TO SEND ME A REPLACEMENT CIRCUIT BOARD FOR $45.00. I DON'T THINK SO. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.
1,Definitely not built to last,"Like other reviewers, we had ours for less than a year when the main circuit board died. They wanted around $45 to send us a new part, which I find outrageous. How do they justify and live with one of their models lasting less than a year? In fact, I am wondering if they're designed that way -- go bust in less than a year's time to force people to buy the new part...cynical maybe but crazier things happen everyday. Shame on Vinotemp!"
1,Lasted 3 Years and died,Should have checked into more reviews. After 3 years it died and costs too much to repair. Going to try NewAir this time.
1,Vinotemp Winecooler,"I bought the Vinotemp Vt-12TED about a year ago (12/2009) and it never held the temperature as set. It was NEVER too cold always too hot. If I set it at 65F it would always be at 70F. If I set it at 55F it would stay at 70F. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYTHING, OTHER THAN THE TRASH!"
2,VT-12TEDS-2Z stoped after 13.5 months,"I bought the unit on 11/28/2008. Looks nice, compact & dual zone. Perfect for on top of the wet bar counter. Worked fine, no issues until 01/2010. For about two weeks it was having problems holding the temperature variation in the dual zones.. then evened the temperatures to the same degree in both zones, then no power when plugged in. I would not buy this unit. I should have known with a 90 day warranty the manufacturer knew the technology was not stable enough to risk providing a minimum of 12 month warranty period."
2,Good while it lasted,"After almost 24 months it died on me with no warning at all. I had it sitting under my desk where it got plenty of ventilation and was out of the sun. If I plug it in it makes a clicking noise in the back and no lights come on, good thing my city electronic waste recycling is free this month. It looks very nice and kept my wine cool while it worked, but now I need to replace it. I agree with other reviewers that the shelf spacing isn't large enough for some of the bigger wine bottles out there, and it really isn't very deep either. Next time I will purchase a different brand that has a bit more space inside and is built with better parts."
1,Horrible Product,Wow!!! The other reviews are so right on. Bought my cooler approximately 1 year ago. I woke up this morning and heard a clicking sound coming from my Vinotemp wine cooler. I then noticed the LED display was not lit. I remved the back panel and noticed that a green and a red light were flashing on and off. [...] . What crap!
2,One more,"Just like most of the reviews above, my unit worked great..while it worked... Held a good temperature (I had a analog thermo in the unit) and was sleek. Control board failed last week after approx 1 year. Clicking sound and green light flashing. I'll probably buy the stupid board just so I don't have to throw this thing away."
2,Not quite worth it.,We had this for almost 2 years before it started clicking and went out. Called the company and were told that it would be 35.00 plus shipping for a new circuit board. After reading reviews on the item we decided it was not worth it. We too experienced it having a mind of its own when it came to setting the temperature. We almost got our money's worth.
1,Too big for a paperweight,"As others have stated, do NOT buy. Less than 3 months and it has the clicking noise without any lights....looks like a prime case for a class action..D"
4,Best instant oatmeal ever,"This is IMHO the best instant oatmeal ever. The problem is only one grocery in my area carries this brand and they are erratic in stocking the flavors I like (Apples 'n Cinnamon and Baked Apple). Consequently, I have to order it on line. The only draw back to online ordering is price; it cost me more than 100% more to order on line than to purchase in the store ($0.99 in store vs $2.15 per serving on line). And to make matters worse, Amazon doesn't stock it all the time. Right now I have to sign up to be notified when it will be available again. So, I end up having to go to other suppliers on line to find this product.However, this is still the best instant oatmeal in the world and I will pursue it to the ends of the earth!!!!"
1,"Extremely, over-rated","I bought this game in hopes that it would be similar to the pc version of The Sims. But it is a bit more complicated than that. I don't like the controls, they're confusing and it takes a while to get used to them, and getting the right view is nearly impossible. I personally don't reccomend this game for other The Sims fans. You don't really get to customize your character like the other games either, which is disapointing."
4,My favorite Sims game,"As everyone else has stated... this is certainly unlike any other sims games. You won't have a house to buy or build, you wont have to have a bunch of annoying friends that constantly nag for your attention... but rather you get to run free and do anything you want. In fact, i'm probably the only one still playing this game in 2012! I've been a fan of all the Sims game since the beginning and this one beats all.Pros:- Interactive Jobs- More clothing styles- Needs stay green longer- More money- Crash Pads in every district- Excellent graphics- Real music- WEATHER!Cons:- Too many loading screens.- Game doesn't have enough goals- Too many villians- Stupid pets that pee and get in the way- Can't queue the same object twice in a row"
2,Urbz: Sims in theCity,"This game was not as fun as the newer version. It was a lot harder to understand, but it was okay for those that have the time to read cheat codes to find out how to operate the SIMS. I rate this a C-"
2,Disappointed!,"My children found this game quite a disappointment. They claim it was ""kinda boring, and not entertaining"" in comparison to the other Sims games which they love. They recommend the ""Sims Unleashed Expansion Pack"" and Sims versions one and two."
5,definantly good,"For anyone that doesnt like this-- i think its time to stop complaining and relise that either A. you are to old for this game or B. you dont know how to have fun, or you cant bring yourself to make it fun. Amazing game, great graphics, and evreyone who says its bad becuase its about gaing popularity and all that jazz, lighten up. Relax znd let yourself have some fun!"
1,it's to slow,Everytime you wanna go to a different place change your look or go home it needs to load it takes about the same amount of time to load the whole game in most games. I will never buy it sucked compared to the rest of the sims game ut i'm notsure about sims 2 my computer isn't good enough to play it. But only buy the game if you want to sit and wait forever just to play for 5 mins.
5,Excellent Historical Book,"I am an Arthur Ransome fan, but there is a lot in this book, of which I was not aware. An Excellent biographical work."
5,Cover for mah jongg and bridge table,"Cover is of excellent quality and met the need I had. Shipped to me ahead of schedule, which I appreciated."
4,You should learn your music.,"Shadows Fall is metal, Mastodon is stoner hard rock, and hell even Trivium are more thrash. Killswitch have more in common with the old melodic death movement from Sweden during the mid 90's than hardcore any day. Hardcore sucks, Terror, Hatebreed thats hardcore and they suck. Atreyu is more the OC hardcore with the commercial radio friendly crap. Spend five minutes and look up your genres bud."
1,Disappointing,"This was very disappointing, My Son had a very hard time putting the pieces together, as did the rest of the family, Still we did use it as an opportunity to explain about bones and skeletons. And it was certainly durable... But I would not waste the money on it personally."
5,Hilarious!! Not Retarded!,"To Onstar: ""Lady, I repeat, I'm trapped in the car with my parents"". This album is hysterical and infinately quotable. She's intelligent, sarcastic, smart, VERY funny, and will make you tear with laughter. We've listened to it many times and although we know what's coming, it's still hysterical. If you like Ron White you would probably like her. Good political humor, social commentary, with a clean presentation, yet hysterically edgy. She is extrememly sarcastic, with great metaphors about George Bush. I can't wait for her next ablum. ""in other words......"" She's simply a great giggle over and over again. I HIGHLY recommend her. There are so many good routines, I can't pick one."
2,Only Ok,"I had seen an earlier comedy performance of hers by streaming and thought it was pretty good but this one fell a bit flat. Maybe my expectations were too high. It certainly is not bad but not nearly as witty as the previous performance.I do give her high notes for minimal no to profanity. Stand up can be creative and funny without being vulgar.I will still purchase her next offering because overall I think she's a quality performer. She needs to sit the water bottle down, she drank from it so often it was distracting from the content."
4,Smart and funny,"I don't usually enjoy female comics since they seem to always cover the same things, husbands/boyfriends or how hard it is to be a mom. Like I haven't heard it or lived it before! Kathleen Madigan is so smart and funny. Fresh, funny take on life."
4,Pretty good,"I generally don't like comedians that only talk about their families, but I liked this. Not great, but worth three dollars if you want to watch some stand-up comedy."
2,disapointed,i ordered these earring and was disappointed with them. It was my fault as they had the dimensions listed. Not my style at all.
4,"Better Than Being the ""Screen Police""!","The kids can argue with you all day long about more computer time, but when the computer shuts down automatically after a pre-determined amount of time, it's final! I love this program. It's not quite as intuitive as I had hoped, but then again I'm no computer genius . . ."
1,not worth it,"purchased in 2008, it hosed up my computer from the start and I had to replace the hard drive to remove it, thought about reinstalling today but it will cost me another 29.95 to get it going, not a good product."
3,Good idea difficult execution,"This product is OK. However under Vista, it would crash when in administrator mode. Generally could start it back up without a reboot and usually get done what needed to get done. No terribly intuitive but worked OK. My new ISP handles filtering now and it's much easier!!!"
1,Time and Money Bandit,"I bought this because of its' high rating, but after two years of owning this software, I am not sure what other people liked about it. It was difficult to install, and every year it shuts off internet access until you pay $29.95 again. I have had this installed for two years and I have had to pay it every year. I use it on two computers for my two kids. Every time I paid this I had more trouble. It seems that paying the extra $29.95 is not enough to get it working again. I had to call customer service each time to get it working again, and so, twice a year, I have to spend hours on the phone to customer service to get it working again. (I have to do this once for each computer per year). Learn from my mistake, Avoid this money and time bandit. Maybe they call it ""Time Control"" because of the time an adult has to spend trying to keep this software running."
1,"Good product, but be aware of the hidden $29.95 annual subscription fee","After using the software for one year, I am satisfied with the functions and ease of use of the software. However, I am totally surprised recently to find out that for the web filtering function, there is a $29.99 annual subscription fee, which in my opinion, it is a total rip off. What's the purpose of the software without web filtering? It's cheaper to buy a new one than paying this fee every year. The fee is not listed anywhere on the box or product description. Here is the link to their FAQs:[...]"
1,After two years of glitches I'm giving up!,"I have Windows XP and this is installed on two computers. This software has prevented my kids from accessing the safe websites I have listed forcing me to bypass everytime so they can access them. What's the point then? On bypass mode it won't even list the websites or computer files accessed, much less the time period or date. Additionally, it will cause glitches on the admin's side and I can't access my own programs. Also, it will randomly shut off the settings I have customized for the kids forcing me to restart the computer. It will say ""the settings are locked by another process"". I'm uninstalling this expensive piece of garbage today and replacing with something better. do not waste your time. I did for two years and it was just ridiculous."
1,Terrible tech support,"I would advise NOT buying this software. I have contacted the company 4 times for help in resolving an issue, and I never got any kind of response. If you buy it, you should pray that there are no issues for your computer."
3,"Pretty book, but not enough instruction","I like the book for the pictures, but her instructions leave me in the dark. I may use some of the designs for hat or headband patterns, but that's about it. Worth picking up used, not new."
4,"A great CD, buy it before it go out of stock","Some songs makes the CD really worth: the live version of ""Cindarella Search"", expecially the lead guitar, is wonderful. Some other songs, like ""Lady Nina"", are nice, but have to be labeleled definitively as ""B"" sides. These are the minority on the CD, and after all I think this is a very good one. I liked the first edition which missed ""Keyleight"", ""Fugazi"" and ""Script for a Jester Tears"" and I think these three songs add a great value to a CD which was already good."
5,5 star,fantastic perfect addition to any Fish or Marillion fan. Had these on vinyl much much better on compact disc. Thanks
3,Marillion - Real To Reel (Bonus CD),"É um disco razoável e que vale para completar a coleo do Marillion. Um disco ao vivo originalmente que melhorou a qualidade nesta verso remasterizada. O disco bnus no traz excelentes novidades, mas vale para quem gosta da banda com o vocal do Fish. Nada além disso!"
5,Super Funny,"Super funny, but buy it at audible.com for next to nothing rather than on the CD. Everyone in the cast gives a first rate performance, and Estelle Harris (George's mother on Seinfeld) is hilarious."
2,Maybe for a watchmaker,"These are not split bifocals. They're 'all the time' magnifiers, so they go on and off constantly while working.The split bifocals are much better but they're hard to find.Did I mention these are designed for smaller heads? Maybe the 4 four tall tiny aliens found at Roswell N.M. could use these for 'Earth Vision' or something. They don't work for me."
1,Weak,Good thing there were screenshots of the movie on here. It looks nothing like the DVD cover and it looks ridiculously cheap in storyline and casting and design.
1,Titled wrong!,"I am disappointed that the book with a title about tailgating has so many recipes requiring the oven! I can use any of the cookbooks I already own to find things to bake and take to the game. If you are looking for a cookbook with recipes to cook on a grill or with some other portable devise in the parking lot before the game, this is NOT the book you want. If you are looking for interesting and even tasty recipes that you can cook for guests in your home (watching the game on TV or such) this cookbook is fine."
4,Linda di Chamounix,"Buy this video for beautiful singing all round, and the music is consistantly fine. The story seems to be a comedy done seriously, or a drama done lightly, the production is unsure which, and the staging is serviceable but looks cheap--perhaps intentionally. Gruberova takes the ""hit tune"" early on rather fast to show off, but she can get away with it. These drawbacks are minor. The dumbness of the storyline may be why ""Linda"" is neglected. In general, this rarely performed opera is a surprisingly beautiful and often exciting ""find."""
5,An eloquent read...,"Whether or not you are familiar with the Grecian mileu, I warmly recommend this collection of Joy Stocke's poetry that were inspired during a visit to the island of Crete. Joy's words and expressions are as classically elegant as Grecian columns. Moreover, any one -- if not all -- of her works will touch a chord in your heart. Reading this book will delight your soul as well as stimulate your mind."
1,Extremely derivative,"From what I can tell, One-21 has changed their sound quite a bit since this album, and I think that's a good thing. I would rather have someone pound tent stakes into my ears than listen to this garbage. It's a shameless rip off of Operation Ivy and Rancid, all the way down to the bass lines. Don't get me wrong- there's nothing wrong with sounding slightly derivative- all bands are to some extent. But this cd is nothing more than a ""good clean fun"" version of Rancid. So why not just buy a Rancid cd? They're fifty times better. Christian magazines even marketed the band that way- if you liked Rancid, you were suppossed to like One-21. A way to play punk in your mom's minivan without making her angry. I remember being so disillusioned when I actually discovered Rancid and realized how much this band (and Christian bands in general) rip off what's already out in the culture rather than creating something new. In closing, this cd is utter rubbish."
2,Must be some thing at the factory..,"I Think this product has a serious problem..I received 3 of them and it was the same for all of them..You have to jockey with the earpiece connector plug for quite a time, justto get it to work, then you have to keep adjusting it so it will stay working.Need I say more..."
3,"good, but foggy","I have used the older version of these glasses for a few years. Although bulky and geeky, they performed very well under all circumstances. The newer version looks sleeker ( marginally), but fog up on my face with the slightest bit of exertion. I have addressed this with some anti- fogging stuff for dive masks...but it only helps a little.If bifocals just don't cut it for you, then these are the best alternatives I have found."
1,"""Spring has sprung"" and other clumsinesses!","Oh boy! I thought this book, by a fellow South African, would be a treat. Out of loyalty, I waded through it hoping to find some redeeming feature.Example (p7): It was a pleasant, sunny morning, spring had sprung, and she was feeling a bit better to be out and about working on Raspberry Hill.Hm... OK, often less is more, and the simple is the eloquent. Personally I found it funny.On page 17, Etienne (the hero) says ""..There is the problem of who is going to stand 'in loco parentis' of three young boys.' [whose father had died.] I thought it was 'in LOCUM parentis' ('in place of the parent').And while the hero was supposedly a good looking Australian, why did I keep seeing him as fat and toady? Um, make that fat, South African and toady. Probably because the things he said sounded like those typically said by such."
2,Watch Out!,"This filter did not come with the advertised prefilter. The filter is too small for the application which is a poorly designed Euro Pro Shark Pursuit upright vacuum cleaner that is designed to shut down on overheat when the small filter clogs, and that happens in less than 5 minutes of vacuuming. It takes 45 minutes for the vacuum to cool down enough to restart."
2,stilton cheese,"The product arrived within the designated time but the cool packs surrounding the cheese were no longer cool. Inside was a leaflet stating that if this happens then it's no problem essentially and the cheese is still good which may be the case but I would have felt more assured by this product had it arrived cold. I had no idea how long the cheese was left out (non-cold). Other food distributors can manage to deliver their products still cold, why not igourmet?I was particularly annoyed by this as the shipping for this item was so high.I will not order anything that's fresh from igourmet again simply for this reason."
4,many way to say i love you and really mean it,"this is A good book i would recomand to any who likes mr rogers.i use to watch his show when i was a child. he was a smart and caring soul thank youmr rogers. Being a child of the 60's was fun fred open the world up for us and made us see thattheir were NO ONE to say "" that you can't do that becaues your a woman"" The Flower children really let it all hang out. with the roits and public disobaidence and it was a wild time for all of us. getting to see the hippies first hand in San Francisco what a rush."
1,O rings were cheap,Cheap plastic o-rings caused it to leak. Had it connected to gravity fed rain barrel and leaked out the rain water.
2,NO POINTS HERE,"HE MISSES A 3 POINT SHOT. HE MISSES A 2 POINT SHOT. HE MISSES A SIMPLE 1 POINT FOUL SHOT. NO POINTS FOR THIS BOOK. THE EDITOR SAYS HE HAS COMPILED SOME OF THE BEST EXCERPTS EVER WRITTEN ABOUT BASKETBALL. EITHER HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE GAME, OR HASN'T READ ENOUGH BOOKS ABOUT THE GAME. A DEFINITE SKIP."
2,"Good try, but falls short","I appreciate the effort that went into making this film. The acting was not as good as other Christian films. It just didn't measure up to my expectations. The story line was not very strong either, though it did have some good moments."
2,Not good,"Weak at points, poor portrayals of characters, inaccurate and can be annoyng if you have read the Bible. Why is it so difficult for contemporary directors to follow the story line?"
1,Imaginative,"They have gone to far with creative ability....making stuff up, we watched it for an hour subsequently it went into the garbage."
4,Excellent Depiction of the Scriptures,"I thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of the purpose of Christ on earth. The ""telling"" through the envisioned eyes of Peter was an excellent approach."
3,Not exactly what I expected,Was Peter really that old and unkempt looking? Scratchy voiced to boot. I was a little disappointed with his portrayer.Content was good but dragged several places.
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a film for my family that would be a moving true to life spiritual drama of the Apostle Peter's life and the last supper. I appreciate the producers efforts but they didn't have to mix fiction so much with the facts...Scripture alone is beautiful why they felt like they had to doctor things up so much, I don't know. While watching it I had to point out to my daughter the parts that were in scripture and the parts that were not...I just didn't want her watching the movie without knowing...This was annoying. I wish I could find another dramatization of the Apostle Peter's life. One that would stay more true to scripture and biographical facts...Something with a holy feel and good dramatization...Anyways, God bless the movie producers of this film. At least they tried..."
3,It's ok,This is not something I would watch over and over to learn more about Peter. It is unlike the movie PAUL which gives you at lot to think about and helps you understand more about who Paul was and how he might have lives.
1,She needs Hellp (typo intentional...),"Mary Baxter follows a long line of those who have ""been there, done that"" and come back to merchandise it. Her account is by far the most ridiculous; even Betty Eadie's Mormon afterlife has more in common with the Bible (and that is damning with faint praise.) Hell shaped like a human body? Satan ruling Hell? Where in the world did she get these notions? Oh yeah, ""Jesus"" showed them to her (hint: this was not the Jesus of the Bible.) I suppose what really saddens me most about this book has been its popularity. It sat atop the bestseller lists in Christian bookstores for several months. Why? It is nothing more than poorly written fiction. But to talk to many Christians, this belongs in the canon of Scripture."
5,Scared the hell out of me,"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a believer in Christ, but once I stared reading I couldn't set it down. This book got my total attention and scared the hell out of me. If you're a believer in Christ than I have to strongly recommend this book.As for those like myself,I assure you that after you read this book you're always going to wonder if you're living the right way of life.All I know is that hell is the very last place I'd like to be."
3,Give Me A Break!,"This book was recommended to me by a lady that I work with. She is a very dedicated Christian and a very nice person. I mean no disrespect to those of you who believe, like my co-worker, that there is any truth in this book. We all have an obligation to our fellow man to try to enlighten and keep them from hell, but I have a couple of questions:If we save even tens of thousands of souls from eternal damnation, or hell, by telling lies, will we still go to Heaven???Can we be saved by believing a lie?I am going to continue to believe that there is a hell, and be confident that I never want to know what hell is really like."
5,"Beautiful, informative... a must!","Best work I've seen on TNG as yet; a real pleasure to read, leaf through and read again. If you're a TNG fan, you need this."
5,poetic lyrics...,"Eisley was a band i stumbled upon by an MTV interview, after that i had to check them out. I was definalty not disappointed. The lyrics that Eisley sings is like reading poetry at the same time. ""Laughing City"" was my favorite track as was ""I Wasn't Prepared"" and ""Telescope Eyes"". I felt that ""Tree Tops"" had a steady loud beat that kind of drew you away from the mellowness of the rest of the CD, but again, the lyrics were well written. It's something I'd add to any collection and still earns a spot in my CD rotation."
4,Tyler Family Bring It,"Eisley, Laughing City (EP) Warner Bros./Reprise:Made up of three sisters, a brother and a next-door neighbor, this local quintet shows artistic wisdom well beyond its years. Its freshman effort is smooth and melodic, but not overly poppy. The two lead singing sisters (Stacy and Sherri Dupree) dominate the tracks with their beautifully syncopated vocals. ""I Wasn't Prepared For This"" displays the band's keen awareness to their surroundings through simple lyrical connotations. One thing is certain about Eisley: The group has a unique sound, which is saying something in an age where the next big thing sounds like the same old thing. Every song reflects the band's sincerity, and you feel that this effort is genuine."
4,I's likin' Eisley,"Great band.A lot of comparisons can be made - (Innocence Mission, Sixpence, Belly, etc . . .)but they've certainly got their own thing going on.I first heard this band when I was listening to the radio running through the park, on local radio here in Texas. Which was kind of interesting, because they played ""Telescope Eyes"" with the line ""let your short legs carry you away . . ."" and it was all kind of funny, to be running hard to that. Anyway. It just assaulted me - they are so young and their lyrics, vocals and overall compositions really moved me. I can't wait for a full-length record . . . Song #7 is a really incredible composition if you ask me, uniquely strange and beautiful.Additionally, it was a nice surprise to see them with Coldplay - they performed well - the vocals are as crisp and lovely live as on recording.:)"
3,Pretty good,"After seeing them in concert with brand new i decided to buy there cd out of pity. Brand new and hot rod ciruit are way better live than eisley i thought. They did not mix in with the music and was too light aand soft. The girls were really good looking though. ANyway the cd is pretty good, but i think there are much better bands out there. If your into dashboard or something corporate, buy this cd. The use a elecpiano which is prettycool. Guitars are not the best and the base is not great. But in all the sound and vocals stand out. Eisley is a mediocore band."
4,Eisley on Watch List,"I saw Eisley at Coachella, SXSW and several Dallas shows.I had the pleasure of listening to thier demo stuff for several months and finally the Laughing City ep.'I Wasn't Prepaired"" brings to mind classic Lennon compositions while 'Telescope Eyes"" will certainly have their audiences singing along at live shows.""Tree Tops"" is the sleeper with ingeneous vocal improvisations and memorable instrimentals. ""Over the Mountains"" shows the groups technical expertise bringing to mind arrangements by Pink Floyd and Led Zepplin.The vocal harmonies are reminescent of the Mama's without the Papa's.This band is obviously way beyond thier years, ages 14 to 21. No wonder Coldplay's management snatched them up and is having them open US summer show's.The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 is because I wanted it to last longer than the 5 songs.I have heard thier other material and I can't wait for a full length cd.Those other songs will command a 5 for sure."
4,Eisley is better than what is heard on this album....,"Eisley is AMAZING. The are musically wise beyond their years. The reason I am giving Laughing City a 4 is because I don't feel that this EP shows their true musical capabilities. In fact, I am disappointed in way. I have been listening to their indie release, EP2, for the past few months. I've seen them dozens of times around the Dallas area and at SXSW. These girls and guys are so incredible at what they do, and this EP disappoints me because the general public will not be able to see/hear/understand this. Telescope Eyes has been overproduced. To hear the original version, as it should be heard and played, you must listen to EP2 or go to their website. You must see and hear Eisley live in order to fully experience their greatness. Nonetheless, you should buy this EP in support of such an amazing group. Just know that what you are hearing isn't true Eisley...it's just a small, over produced taste."
1,cheap looking frame,I was very cheap looking and the paint chipped off quickly don't waste your money
3,Something a little different,"This CD is somewhat odd. Yes there is rock music,but it feels like it is borderline punk too. Or more like ''dark rock'' if such a title actually exists. If you happen to like this CD,be warned because the other releases for Duraluxe sound nothing like this,which is a shame because this CD is very unique and not many people even have it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes sludgy rock or just a different kind of band."
3,good,This was a good film if it was not for all the violence and stuff it would be a even better movie. This is not a must see unless you like action films. The acctresses in this movie where really good. I have seen other movies that they where in and they really do get into there acting parts.
1,Few movies are worse than this one,"This was not very entertaining. After I looked at the reviews in Amazon,I bought it. I made a mistake. I collect dvds, and I am going to give this one away for a joke to someone. There is no real plot, the acting was lacking, and the story did not develop very well. I was left wondering why I bought it. I have only bought one that was worse, and I threw it in the trash. People need to review better."
4,Spirit of the night,"It starts with Tara (Jenna Bodner) on a train returning home to Brecon, North Wales to her father's funeral.At the funeral Tara meets a close friend who she has not seen for years Michelle (Blair Valk).Michelle is trying to talk Tara to sell her father estate to Alek (David Starzyk) who wants it for all the treasures within.There is a curse that was placed on Brecon centuries ago and Tara unknowingly falls prey to it.The curse suddenly empowers Tara given her acute animal instincts incredible stamina and strength for filling her desires.Tara search for answer to her family past and then the treachery of her friend is reveal.As the story go on they is a lot of good directing, Spirit of the night leave me still wanting more when it ends so I wonder if there is a sequel."
3,Hot red head she wolf in weakly plotted film,"Huntress is a mixed bag. I really like the concept about an attractive red headed she-wolf. But the problem or problems I had with this one are 1.) They should have focused more on the werewolf 2.) The badly implied threesome and 3.) I wish they could have more background story about the ""curse"". Too bad they didn't make a sequel."
2,dvd,If you like slow moving movies with a lot of sex you might like this one. If your looking for a good killing movie not here. The women are good looking but the acting is rated F.
3,You know what you're getting by the cover.,"Look, if you are buying this movie you know what you're getting. Typical movie from the Full Moon crew. It doesn't have the strongest storyline at all but the main female in the movie is worth the purchase."
4,"A little known, under-appreciated erotic thriller...","This movie is that rarity of rarities: an erotic film that is actually done well. Jena Bodner, in her first film role, delivers a credible performance as a woman undergoing a lycanthropic change and makes the movie worthwhile all on her own. Yes, she is nude every other scene, but you can hardly hold that against her. The castle setting, direction and cinematography all add a great deal to the production. My one complaint is that the ending is a bit inconclusive and up in the air, then, it looks like they were looking to make it into a series of films. The old British TV show ""She-Wolf of London"" might have done well to employ more of the primal, sexual themes used here. This is not one of the high art horror movies, like Dario Argento or Mario Bava, it is strictly exploitation, but it is well-done exploitation, and a pleasant surprise for a weekend night."
4,Very good price for the amount of stuff you get!,"I purchased this to use in my homeschooling(kindergarten) curriculum. I was pleasantly surprised at how much was actually in the package and the very reasonable cost. My only problem is that there appears to be 3 lines of glue on the package backing. So, whatever letters are next to it, were actually stuck to the glue. When I tried to pull them off, it made the back of the letter all fuzzy and little threads pulled away. I'm hoping this does not affect the lifespan of the felt.The kids LOVE the felt letters and the games we can play with them though. :)"
1,Bliss fading..,"I loved Jason in Jellyfish. I loved Jason in the Grays. I loved Jason's 1st solo album. And here, he's just treading water. Has he lost his touch in crafting a pop tune?"
4,Shines Metal Right Up!,"Mother's is a great polish, but having it in a tube would make many applications easier, not to mention transporting it. Unfortunately, it's made mostly for cars, boats and planes, but sportsmen could also use it for their knives and firearms if it came in a large, toothpaste-sized tube. It also would be nice to have free shipping (hint, hint).As it is, carrying it around in a jar is about as much as one can hope for as of now."
5,there is a song that is not in the soundtrack,"when lucy diamond is driving the car inside the tunnel to the club taking amy and the other girl as ""hostage"""
2,Disappointed,"This is probably more like 2.5 stars as there are redeemable songs here.I was disappointed with this CD. I loved the music in the background of D.E.B.S. but I guess I mostly liked just the short parts they played in the movie. Most of these songs I could do without.The best songs on this soundtrack are Be Like Water and Strict Machine. I'm not sorry I bought these but it would have been a lot cheaper to buy them as singles if that were possible. A Little Respect is not bad but I found out I only really like it in the goofy movie scene when Lucy Diamond dances to it. Love Cats is also okay as is Another Girl Another Planet.Even if you absolutely love the movie like I do, buying the soundtrack may not be for you."
4,Please help me find a song not on soundtrack,"I'm looking for the artist name and title of the song in D.E.B.S. where they are in that club Lucy takes the two girls and that guy Scud too. It's not on the soundtrack. It reminds me of going to a club called Eons in greaterford,PA and makes me remember extremely happy times.Any help would be enormous. any ideas?Thanks,Moni"
4,Great campy fun,"Loved this. As a mere male, too. It has a lovely comic book style, and should be taken in that light. Fun, fluffy, sweetly romantic when it needs to be, life-affirming as only American adolescents can be. Go see."
5,"Across the years, Percy Gomery's humor and insight can still touch you.","This is one of the most pleasant travelogues you will have the pleasure to read. I found the title while browsing other sources, and thought I would take a chance. This author was a professional writer, and an auto enthusiast in the early days of long motor tours. His description of travelling across Canada with his wife during the summer of 1920 is priceless. His humor and wit are very readable, and most apt. When I finished the book, I wished I could meet Mr. Gomery personally and shake his hand."
1,Another c leaner,I bought this vacuum Dec.03 used it once and the handle broke took it back to Target and they kindly replaced it. Haven't used it again since Jan.04 since my roomate has a very good vacuum.Well as soon as I try to use it the unit shuts down after only a couple of minutes of use. If I let it sit for an hour or so it will give a couple of minutes of service again. It is by far the most frustrating piece of junk I have ever purchased. I just wish I had the forsight to get a differnt one when the handle broke in Jan. Even though it has only been used a couple of times I have owned to long to take back. I would never recomend or buy anything made by this company again!
4,Gets the Dog Hair!,"I bought this vacuum today--came with a free handheld. The handheld is tiny compared to others out there and just as (if not more) powerful. The upright: I did the kitchen floor and the bedroom (carpet). Initially I said it's a vacuum; it did what it should but I have a dog and much of fur had accumulated under the bed (clumped around the footposts); last week I had used my old vacuum (which went kaput when a dog toy got stuck in but that's a different story) and it could not make a dent in the accumulated dog fur. The shark picked it up like it was nothing. So as of now, I'm impressed. It's also very light and easy to maneuver and the headlight is brighter than others I've used."
1,Complete garbage,"I don't even own this vacuum, luckly. However, I borrowed it from my friend since our own vacuum is beyond help. Obviously, this vacuum doesn't put us in a much better situation. It's complete garbage though, it will last about 3-5 minutes with a mid-way (by the ""full"" line) filled canister, and about 5-10 with it completely empty. I've owned a kenmore that's still kicking strong after 15 years, and this Shark vacuum still has the tags and stickers on it. Going to recommend my friend to return it while she can. Trolls need not bother saying ""WELL CLEAN THE FILTER MORE LOLZ!"", because while that effects how long it's short time span is, it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It's just a horrible vacuum.Never going to buy from this brand again, and will make sure to pass it on to friends, and obviously you folks."
1,I despise this vacuum!!,"My biggest problem with this vacuum is that there is only one tiny little hole for all the dirt to be sucked up in...it's on only one side of the vacuum (very deceiving!) and it constantly gets clogged and it's not easy to get to so you can clean it out. It shuts down all the time....It's just an overall mess and their customer service will cost you more money than a new vacuum...total waste of money.My cheap ""backup"" vac, which is a little $20 Boss has more amp and better suction that this piece of crap. I wind up using it on more areas that I do the shark, which is more like a sick goldfish."
2,Lots of work to clean!,"Seems to pick up dog hair well, but HEPA filter clogs with dust so quickly I have to clean it after vacuuming each room. Each time there are several parts to remove, disasemble, and clean (usually by wacking them against the fence), and even though I'm doing this outdoors there is no way to avoid the clouds of dust that fly out. If you don't clean it frquently it overheats. The little hand held ""Baby Shark"" that came with it is pretty useful, but otherwise this thing's a pain. I'm going to bite the bullet and spend four times as much on a Dyson, hoping I don't have to clean the filter so often."
1,"Ok, if it works","I've had this unit less than 4 months and used it maybe 10 times. It overheats quickly, after which you have to wait a long time for it to start again and then it'll only work for a few minutes.Yesterday, the unit stopped working completely and they want me to pay for shipping (they waived return shipping after much complaining) but expect 6 weeks for it to be fixed. In addition to the shipping time of a couple of weeks, at least, this means going without a vacuum cleaner for 2 months. In other words, the warranty is as good as useless. I'll be sure to avoid Euro-Pro products from now on."
1,Unsatisfied,"This video was too simple with only 1 adult speaking and showing the actions. Not at all interesting for children to watch and learn how to do the actions. Furthermore the making Christmas card section most unhelpful. There was only 1 suggestion and that was to write the word ""Merry Christmas"" on a card. I think everybody already knows that! Waste of money."
1,Wrong Donkey!!!,This is not the plush Talking Donkey...it is a smack back Donkey..$7.98 at Toysrus with no shipping.
5,Amazing Book,This is an excellent summary of talks and writing of the Swami Vivekananda. It covers a wide range of material and concepts. Those who follow Religious Science and Unity School of Christianity material will be struck by how close the ideas are to those incorporated into those two faiths.
3,Joyce Walther Returns,"I have never understood the chapbook industry. Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out.Young mystery writer Joyce Waltham has her second story published (the first was in Cardiac Arrest). Joyce is a promising author and a local hero for her involvement in the previous tale. This time she is shopping for copies of the magazine running her latest story when a policeman stops her to report a possible break-in at her car. Joyce follows the policeman to the parking lot and the story really begins. Joyce's detective mind is always at work.This one is not quite as good as Cardiac Arrest as it lacks a similar level of surprise and twist. This one is far more straightforward. Still, it is an enjoyable little mystery. But do check out Cardiac Arrest first.I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading."
1,Very poor,This is just a book of rough maps no details and very few off road trails. Not worth the money.
5,Hair Gel,This is the best hair gel around. If you want your hair to stay spiked you should try this product. I like it very much.
4,"Dusk Till Dwn 3 Pack, Good Stuff!","Arrived quickly, well packaged and in excellent condition. The original movie was by far the best and #3 wasn't bad.... but #2 was a waste of time =("
5,"Fondue, real genuin fondue cheeze","Veryy good cheeze for fondue, from Switzerland. Quick delivery and it is the real thing! very tasty."
3,Our first fondue experience wasn't what it should have been,Our first experience with fondue and I'm totally willing to concede that it's probably our inexperience with fondue. Bought everything you can expect at a fondue party (we've been researching for months). The chocolate fondue was a huge success however this product didn't live up to expectations.The flavors together were a sort of sharp cheese mix which we enjoyed however it was stringy and never truly melted into what you would expect in a fondue cheese pot. We 'may' purchase this again to try however we're thinking of going with another cheese fondue mix (mexican anyone?). We'll seeAgain the flavor was great and even following the directions on how to handle the fondue if it's stringy didn't seem to work. Oh well. Live and learn :-)
3,at the train station,"you would think the whistle is going to annoy you, but it's actually 1 tune and soft sounding, but my son broke it the 3rd day he had it and he's 2"
1,Sounds nothing like a train,"I know the title said ""mini"" but I couldn't believe how small it actually was when I got it. It barely makes any noise at all unless you blow into it full force, and the noise it does make is high-pitched, annoying, and sounds nothing like a train. I was highly disappointed and would not recommend this toy."
2,Not worth it,"This whistle doesn't make any noise. Instead, I purchased a bigger one from Toys R Us for $0.99 that worked much better. I don't recommend this one."
2,"Small, cheap whistle","I got this for a stocking stuffer for my son. The product is a piece of junk and I regret buying it. The whistle is small, about the size of my thumb. When you blow, it does't really make any sound at all - certainly not a train sound. The whistle was basically opened and tossed aside once the kids realized that it didn't work. I will try another train whistle."
1,Just Awful,I bought this for my nephew because he LOVES Thomas the train. This whistle is JUNK. You have to blow as hard as you can to even make a sound and the sound it does make is ear piercing (sounds nothing like a train). It's also a lot smaller than I thought it would be. This isn't worth the money. Wish I would have never purchased this.
1,Terrible Product.,"This product was not worth my money or time trying to make it work. Im sure the makers of this product thought it would be a little cute toy but out of the mailbox it didn't work at all. My son on the other hand liked it somewhat. He would just make the toot toot sound with his own voice. Half a day later, it was garbage. The mouth piece shattered and collapsed. Such a flimsy wood toy. Buyer beware."
4,It's great for youngsters!,"Got this fairly quickly, and like others have said it is not too loud of a whistle. It's something that a child can blow into that won't grate on your nerves after a while. Plus, the little guy i bought if for really gets a kick out of the train sound whenever he sees his (silent) Thomas the tank engine being pushed down the track. I recommend this for anyone who wants their child to like the sound of a train whistle!"
5,WILD AT HEART,"FINALLY A BOOK FOR MEN, ABOUT REAL MEN AND HOW WE REALY SHOULD ACT, AND NOT WORRY ABOUT BEING PC."
1,Waste of time,Waste of time. Started off with some nice thoughts but makes like everyone (male and female) is permanently wounded by others. Nonsense.
2,What's the Real Purpose?,"Though Eldredge puts a lot of thought and energy into the book it appears to lose ground in parts to an disquieting echo of the ""me"" generation. Giving your life to Christ allows you to understand it's not all about ""me."" If you feel you have lost the zip in your life and your marriage there's a higher purpose other than gaining (or regaining) the ""dangerous"" aspect of your masculinity. I would recommend reading Warren's ""The Purpose Driven Life"" with WAH. Figure out why you are here first, the rest will fall into place."
2,Melodramatic!,"I recommend ""Wild at Heart"" The bookBut not the ""field manual"" The manual is a work-book intendedto used as part of a ""12 week study"" In it the author assumes your ""raymond"" from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" not all of us men are. In my case I'm ""Robert"".The study book requires a support group. Eventhough Eldredge [the author] denys it. He is a thrill-seekerwho's hook on bloody action films. [ his hobbies include ""cliff diving"", ""rock climbing"",& ""fishing amongst grizzlies"".] ""Braveheart"" is one of his favorite films. And reading between the lines, he seem to be promoting bullying. With his ""anger is good""and ""be dangerous""."
1,Perpetuates the agony,"The book, _Wild at Heart_, is a poor attempt by Eldredge to ""help"" men find their 'adventure', and this Field Manual is just an extension of that misfortune. You would be much better off skipping both the book and the manual, and looking to the Bible and your own wife (for those of you who are married)."
5,Essential workbook to accompany the book.,This is really a workbook with deep revealing questions to accompany each chapter in the book. If used for a personal journey or a small men's group this field manual wll guide a man through his inner problems and facilitate excellent discussion points and to help each man on his journey to find what God has created men for.
3,Wild at heart,This is in my library and will be valued for its help in counseling people through their personal struggles. It was recommended.
4,Great companion to the book Wild At Heart,"If you are looking for a good mens study, Wild at Heart and Wild at Heart Field Manual are a great set to use."
2,Lame,Seemed to be aimed at a person that doesn't know much about flying. Maybe you should wait to get your multiengine rating if you're at that level.
3,"Michelle Branch is a fresh, young talent.","I bought this CD in late 2001 when it first came out after hearing the first single ""Everywhere"" on the radio and at first I thought it was the greatest thing ever (yes, was I ever that young?) but now looking back on it, it's your typical debut from your typical young female contemporary pop/rock artist. But at the same time that dosen't make it a bad, it's still mainstream enough for Top 40 listeners to enjoy and alternative enough for anybody who's not interested in what's top of the pop charts at the moment to enjoy as well. Good album."
4,I like that Michelle!,"Michelle gets in my head and I can not stop thinking about her. I did not think I would like her CD, but some of the songs keep popping into me conciousness. You know, like, ""You're everywhere to me ....."" I would give 5 stars but I think she could be more adventurous. I would like being into her in the future."
3,50/50 Album,"This album has some great songs. Especially the singles she has released but it was a dissapointment. Some of the songs sound wierd and just kind of drone on. The opening music for some of the songs is stupid and does not set a good tone for the song like in Everywhere, and All You Wanted. Although there is bad parts her singing is good and I am glad on the album cover there is no pictures with her stomach showing..... How refreshing!"
5,Where has this girl been all this time?!,"This is one of the best albums by a female artist that I have ever heard! Here I am, about ready to go insane because there are so few albums by females that are good, (The few good artists: Pink) and then here comes Michelle Branch.I""M SAVED! I swear, I must have listened to this CD about seven hours straight and had it memorized in only two. I only have one more question:WHERE WAS SHE WHEN THE PEOPLE WITH BRAINS AND GOOD TASTE IN MUSIC NEEDED HER?!"
2,"No, I'm not being harsh.","I'm being real. The fact that contemporary music listeners acclaim this CD as being one of the most deep and reflective albums in current Pop music shows how dumb we've gotten since Britney Spears and N'Sync. This may be a notch up from Spear Britney and NStink, but it's nothing to be acclaimed; for Christ's sake even the songs that hit the radio are hokey and overproduced, how long will it take listeners to again understand that there IS music past female posterchilds with one-hit-wonder written all over them?No, i'm not scapegoating anybody! This is just uninspired, boring, and incredibly annoying. My female dog Missy has more true emotion and inspiration in her voice, and dog's are probably the most emotionally shallow house animal there is. Stay away from this album, for God's sake I'd recommend Christina Aguilera's new album over this.. I'm Serious!"
1,OVERATED!!,"I don't care if she writes her own songs, or sings without the help of machines like other pop people. Her songs (...). Period. I can understand how people can like her, but she's not ""amazing"". There's been many before her that have written better lyrics. If you listen, her lyrics aren't that ""brillant"". If you want some real female talent, listen to Carole King."
2,Boring.,"I don't even know what I liked about this CD when I bought it.. but I know I never listened to it much, and still don't. It's just plain BORING.. there's nothing original about Michelle Branch at all.. if you want REAL music, check out Def Leppard's Greatest Hits. *I* even write better lyrics than Michelle and I'm not even in the spotlight, lol. Don't waste your money.. she's nothing special and neither is her music."
1,this sounds nothing like mxpx,mxpx are my favorite band because they are punk rawk. this is not punk rawk. this is britney spears. do not buy this album. burn it off of me. just send me email and i will burn you a copy. cause that is the punk rawk thing to do.
3,Bake and let cool for 3 to 5 years,"All power to Michelle for writing and playing her own songs in a music world that is looking for sexpot divas willing to have words fed to them mostly by older men. The fact that she actually plays the music on this album herself merits recognition, but if you are really interested in an album by a good female singer-songwriter I would have to recommend ""Tails"" by Lisa Loeb. I find her lyrics to be quite heartfelt and her acoustic guitar pleasing to the soul. She has also been on this planet a little longer than Michelle. Now I'm not one to knock youthful talent, but experience does count for something and this is apparent in Lisa's words. Hopefully Michelle will keep fighting the good fight and reach a higher level of sincerity and maturity in a few years. In the meantime check out Lisa Loeb."
2,very average overall,I got to hear this Album in full depth recently&I was curious after seeing She was on Madonna's Maverick Records Label.I Give Her Credit for Writing&Playing. but overall thus far in the Game Her Material is fairly Safe.She has a Chance if She is Allowed out of a Formula Sound that appears alot on this Set.Vocally hard to say Where She will end up.
2,not too impressed,"when i first heard ""everywhere"" i didn't like it. as i heard it more and more i started to like it and now i love it. unfortunately there is NOTHING on this album that can live up to the excellence of that song. branch is young though so i'm expecting a better try of course, but this isn't my idea of a good album.the lyrics are stupid on ""you get me"", and i didn't understand ""drop in the ocean"". another songs didn't really keep my attention. i don't think that this album is a good display of the material that she is capable of and its hopefully not a good reflection of her material for the future.i am giving her one star for the fact that she plays her own instrument and for ""everywhere"" cuz thats a hot song. the second star comes from a collection of things: the chorus on ""goodbye to you"", the fact she writes her own music and lyrics, and the fact that she isn't even twenty. but as for musical talent, she loses major points."
5,"music from the heart, I do relate","Amazing, ""Good bye to you"", wow I feel this song, I write music and these lyrics are touching home, and my heart. I've been there and felt there to. Keep the insperation flowing......"
5,Surprisingly great album!!,"After hearing Michelle's second hit single ""All You Wanted"" I thought to myself...""hmmm this girl could go somewhere."" So I finally picked up the album a few weeks ago. Before I listened to it I didn't really have high expectations and thinking that it would probably be full of sappy ballads. Well to my surprise there was only one slow song and that is the last one ""Drop in the Ocean."" I only had to listen to this cd once to fall in love with it. It is a big PLUS in my book for the singer to have written their own material and Michelle both writes and plays her own guitar! I like all the songs on this album but my favorite of hers is definitely ""Here With Me."" Not only it this song catchy but it seems as if it was written by myself because I can relate to it so well. Other stand out tracks are ""Everywhere"",""All You Wanted"",""You Set Me Free"", and ""Sweet Misery.""Great job Michelle!!! Can't wait for the next album!"
2,"Sorry, but it's boring...","The two songs All You Wanted and Everywhere are really good. Because of that i bought the CD, but i'm warning you...all the other songs sound the same. They are slow, use the same tune and Michelle's voice just gets annoying after a while. Rather buy Avril Lavigne's new CD...now there's talent!! Her songs are all different and each one has something new to offer...and she doesn't get boring!!"
4,dont DROP IN THE OCEAN this cd!!!!,"First of all, if you want inspirational pop, go buy Carlton's be no nobody. second of all if you want typicial pop aka radio pop get Clarkson's thankful. but if u want pop with a meaning this is the album for you...branch delivers songs that all have ""plots"" people can relate to...having a crush (everywhere, drop in the ocean) to breaking up (goodbye to u) or even regretting breaking up (if only she knew)....i must say that the two songs i love with all my heart are:DropInTheOcean - this song starts out being a nice song for a night of passion, but then as the night intensifies, so does the song... A+++++++++++++++++++++AllYouWanted - this song is clearly unexplainable...its just too great!the other songs, dont get me wrong, are awesome but my least fave songs are ""something to sleep to"" and ""u get me""i hope this helped - manish"
4,Branch Breaks Through,"What can I say? This CD is great. From the first-released smash single, ""Everywhere,"" you know this disc is going to be a gem. My personal favorite track is ""Somebody Who Cares,"" in which Michelle shows her true roots in vocals. In some of the lines, I had to compare her with fellow artist Alanis Morisette. Don't get me wrong, they aren't very much alike, but you will know what I'm talking about when you hear the second verse. It's unbelieveable to me that it is only her freshman effort: she sounds like a seasoned artist.I would definitely recommend buying this album, because it is pure enjoyment to listen to. She's the first female artist I have genuinely enjoyed for a long time, because she plays, writes, and can SING her own music. Pick up ""the Spirit Room"" and start listening to the next smash hit in pop music."
3,steady rock chick,"Michelle Branch is riding on the success of her first radio hit Everywhere, partly fueled by its appearance in American Pie 2. Ain't no breaking new ground but she does serve a delicious dish of ppo/rock radio tunes that's bound to make u sing along.The fact that she's from Madonna's Maverick will inevitably draw comparisons with the label's #1 star Alanis Morissette, but Michelle has more of a clear, pristine voice. She would appeal to the sub-teens and college kids...Would love to see this lass mature, but it'll take time..."
5,Excellent.,"Wow. Admist the overhype of Avril Lavigne's supposedly self-written, self-played album, Michelle Branch is unceremoniously kicked aside for the unobvious lack of talent that is Lavigne. While Avril goes off claiming to play the guitar, yet playing for only one song on her album, and hyping herself as a songwriter, yet needing help on every single song on her debut, Michelle Branch is an honest breath of fresh air. She indeed, plays the guitar on every single song on her album, and also, unlike her punk counterpart, plays guitar live. She either wrote or cowrote the songs on her album, and her lyrics compared to Avril's seem like the Pacific Ocean compared to a swimming pool (depth-wise).I won't go into detail about every single song, but among my favorites are ""Everywhere"", ""All You Wanted"", ""You Set Me Free"", and ""If Only She Knew"". I STRONGLY recommend this album. Especially above the prefabricated pop-""punk"" trendiness of Avril Lavigne.(Notice I made no reference to Vanessa Carlton!)"
5,Awsome!!!!,"The Spirit Room is the best cd. If you like the song Everywhere, you'll like the whole cd! She is a very talented musician. It's a nice change from Britney and all of those people. This really is a great cd!!!!"
5,Best female singer/songwriter,Michelle Branch is the best female singer/songwriter to come along in a very long time. Her voice is beautiful and so are her songs.She's awesome!
3,"Pretty good, but not great","I listened to this CD ... because I heard Branch sing with Santana on the radio and really liked it. Unfortunately the Santana inspired song, at least in my opinion, is much better than any of the the songs on this CD. She's got a nice voice, but nothing special or new. The songs on the CD are listenable and she will definitely have a nice young following because the music really isn't bad. But for an older listener like myself, who is use to listening to the likes of Houston, Carey, Newton-John, McLachlan, etc etc this isn't the kind of music that I would go crazy about. If the music on this CD was as good as what she sang on Santana's new CD I'd buy it."
5,Very fun catchy music,"Michelle Branch is a very talented singer and musician. I am in my early 40s and find Michelle's music very refreshing. It's a nice change to see such a young girl's singing, writing and playing instruments and doesn't get loud with her lyrics like most young musicians of today."
4,pretty good cd,"this is a pretty good cd that shows that michelle has a lot of musical range, kind of poppy but what isn't today"
5,one word....whoa,"okay...my review may not be the MOST helpful review in the world butI got this CD for christmas and I love it. Here with me, Everywhere, All you wanted, and If only she knew are my favortie songs on this CD. the songs were played on the radio or have a unquie beat to them that i have never heard before.note: if you wanted Goodbye to you on this CD...THE SONG ON THE CD IS NOT A RADIO EDIT...IT IS THE ORIGINAL RECORDING. i was bummed out when it wasnt a original recording...but it didnt stop me from likeing this CDIf you want a CD that has a great voice adna nice steady beat..then i recommend that you get this CD"
5,A delight!,"Michelle Branch is a breath of fresh air in an industry full of Britney and Christina type divas who sell their bodies not their music. I'm delighted that there is a woman who has entered into the teen scene who doesn't dress up as a hooker and wear absurd hair extentions.Great music, great lyrics and a great voice that is all her own. What more could you ask for?"
5,My Absolute Favorite CD,Michelle is such a talented singer and songwriter. Not to mention she plays guitar. I love her lyrics and style. I would recommend this CD to anyone!
5,Awesome CD!!!!,"I bought this CD with a gift card I got for Christmas and I wasn't disappointed. When the song, ""Everywhere"" first came out, I wasn't all that crazy about it but it took a while for the song to grow on me. My sister got the CD from a friend and my best friend also has the CD and I'd go over to her house and listen to it non-stop. The songs that I listened to were pretty good so I decided I'd go out and buy the CD for myself. It turned to be a great album and I hope Michelle Branch does just as good on the Hotel Paper CD. My favorite songs on this CD are ""Everywhere"", ""All You Wanted"", ""You Get Me"", and ""Here With Me."""
2,Highly overrated,"I have listened to this too many times trying to find what people see in this, these ears don't hear it. Her voice is nothing special, same with the meaningless lyrics. The melodies are just as easily forgetable as the words. Don't buy this CD because you like the first song (everywhere) like I did. The rest of the disc sounds nothing like it. It's the only truly good song on the CD. There are about 3 others that are listenable. The rest I can hardly even get through, with some of the music and background vocals so annoying in places I want to pull the CD out of the player and smash it. Lousy production to me with annoying background vocals that like to drown out the main vocals. There is alot better music than this out there, not recommended by me. If you want some new chick tunes that rock with decent production, lyrics with some meaning and real melodies, try Rachel Farris her voice and songwriting skills infinitely better than Michelle Branch."
3,Entertaining album,"Thanks to the mega-hit ""All You Wanted"", Michelle Branch has enjoyed commercial success with her debut album, ""The Spirit Room"". While she may write her own songs and play guitar, most of the songs on this CD offer up nothing new and are as catchy as can be. The difference, though, is that Michelle proves that having a hit song doesn't mean you have to have manufactured vocals and snappy dance moves. I think that Michelle has great potential as a songwriter and only once does she show how great she can be, on the song ""Drop in the Ocean"". While this album isn't spectacular, it's an entertaining one and it shows the promise of this young woman."
5,The Best CD Out at The Moment,"Michelle Branch is so unmanufactured, it's amazing she has come so far in the indusrty. She has amazing vocals, she plays guitar wonderfully, and she writes all her own music. The songs are so powerful, much more than Avril or Brittany. Definetly the best albumn of the year (for me, at least)"
4,Great but overproduced,"I think this disc shows the great talent of Michelle Branch, but it suffers from being overproduced. There are some music and vocal effects that get on my nerves and make it difficult for me to whole-heartedly recommend this disc."
5,Wow~~can it be any better? ^.^,"I heard the title song ""Everywhere"" on the radio...had no idea who it was but thought it was extremely catchy and fun to listen to..And I found out that it was Michelle Branch......as soon as I knew who it was ..I had to own it. Style of music is very pop, and country, which sounds alike Natalie Imbuglia <-(probably wrong spelling ^.~) and some start out like groups like Goo Goo Dolls, Jessica Riddle, Nikki Hassman, Jessica Sheely <-(they are in ""Wedding Planner"" sound track),yet Michelle shows that she is somewhat different that those artists. I just hope that she would continue wonderful song writting...she's one of those artists who I've would love to buy next album, expecting that it would be just as ..no ...way better, improved songs that would give back to the pleasure of listening music."
5,shes gggrrrrreeeeeeeaaaaatttt,she was so awesome in her songs and shes from mesa arizona my home town baby My names Bob Mschcioush
4,polished and pleasing...though a little derivative,"I must admit, I very much liked Branch's first single, Everywhere, and was waiting for a second single to be released before purchasing the cd. Though I don't know if a second single HAS been released, I know that I did give in and buy the album...and am glad that I did. Some of the songs are too pop oriented and seem geared for a younger demographic...but there are enough fine ones (such as Drop in the Ocean) to redeem the album and make it worthy of purchase. A guilty pleasure, perhaps, but when pleasure comes so few and far between...why not enjoy?!"
4,What a great song!,"I really love the song ""Goodbye To You"". After seeing Michelle sing it at the end of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, I had to get the CD. She is really talented. All the songs are good. But I can listen to ""Goodbye To You"" over and over."
1,sux,stereotypical depressed female brunette rocker girl singing about stereotypical depressing issues regarding lovegeez how many times have we heard thatOOH TEH IRONY!!!
2,Didn't listen to anything other than te singles,"So that explains my three stars. What I heard was musically 1 at best. I can no longer stand pop radio. I guess music is supposed to be about freeing some emotions. That works here from what I've heard. However, it still isn't fascinating in the least. Lastly, can anyone else find anything different than Venessa Carlton. I think Clonaid succeeded a full 17 or so years before they told us. Absoutely indecipherable."
2,hi from the shadow room,"I'm not a big fan of women's music, but this is ok. i also recommend Love, Shelby if you like this."
2,JUST B/C SHE'S BETTER THAN SPEARS DOESN'T MAKE HER GOOD,"I've only heard one song but it was enough to know that Michelle Branch is being very over-hyped. She's not that good. Her voice and lyrics are average, if that. Her hit song, whatever it's called, sounds like it could have been written for any teenybop singer. I heard she writes her songs, though, so I have to give her that much credit. At least she has enough intelligence to write her own lyrics, however unoriginal they are. I guess our society is so accustomed to bad untalented pop singers (Spears, C. Aguilera, J. Simpson, M. Moore, J. Lopez, etc.) that when one of barely average talent comes along, they are held in much higher regard than they deserve. Michelle Branch is an example of that."
4,Better than most,"This cd is one of the better pop cds. I'm giving her 4 stars in comparison to other pop cds. But you say it's talent? I could write better songs than hers when I was 11. But I'm classical. To be a classical composer you dont just have to look pretty and be able to play two chords on a guitar that sound ok. You have to have true talent. This is a good example of basic, simple, and unoriginal music. OOH! WOW! She could pick up a guitar when she was 14. That sure is talent."
3,I Think You Should Buy This One!,"This is an awesome cd! I love the song ""All You Wanted."" But to tell you the truth, after a while the songs get old. Ecspecially ""Everywhere."" It will get old fast. I have put this CD at the back of my cd case. I tried to give it to my little sister but she did not like it either. Even my dog would not dance to it! But for those people who love listening to the same songs over and over again, HERE IS THE CD FOR YOU!"
3,Stop-ah Saying-ah Ah-ah...,"This CD has some REALLY great songs on it. BUT Michelle has this anoying habit of singing an extra ""-ah"" at the end of every verse. The first track is by far the worst... but others throughout the CD are also bad.This CD would be great if she could just stop-ah adding-ah an ""-ah"" at the end-ah of every line-ah!"
2,"Very, very boring","I have to echo what a lot of other people are saying: This album is really mediocre. It's a collection of bland, inoffensive, peppy tunes that will fade from mind as soon as the CD ends. I actually skipped past a lot of the songs on the first listen. I was expecting alot more, but the album didn't live up to the promise of ""All You Wanted"". I guess she gets some credit for writing the songs herself, but what does that matter if it still sound like the same commercialized, processed pop?"
2,"""Goodbye to You"" featured in Buffy tVS Season 6","Michelle Branch did a guest spot on BtVS Season 6's episode, ""Tabula Rasa"" (the episode following the incredible ""Once More With Feeling"" musical). Watch and listen as ""Goodbye to You"" is the only sound as Tara's, Willow's, and Buffy's worlds fall apart."
4,A GOOD BUY,"I LOVE MICHELLE BRANCH SHE IS NOT LIKE MOST POP STARS I LOVE HER SONGS ""HERE WITH ME"" AND ""EVERYWHERE"" SHE DOESN'T NEED TO SHOW 2 MUCH SKIN TO PROVE SHE HAS TALENT SOME PEOPLE CONFUSE HER WITH VANESSA CARLTON BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON VANESSA IS THE ANNOYING ONE NOT MICHELLE"
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT,This album is awsome. Most of the songs are great. She is no doubt one of the best singers ever.
4,Christian for teens,Michelle is an awsome artist. As a christian teen it is hard to find music that is age/religion/content appropriate. I enjoy listening to MB and it is great. I reccomend for any and all teens. Any age group actually.
2,Disappointing,"i decided to try e cd when i saw so many giving her e thumbups.But, it turned out to be disappointing.Yes, i like the tunes of many of the songs.However, i find her voice really irritating.It gets too sweet, whiney and unnatural at too many a time. It just doesn't go well with the music."
4,Not Quite All I Wanted...,"This is a pretty good CD, my favorite songs being All You Wanted, Everywhere, and Sweet Misery. The rest of the songs are pretty good, but none really live up to the expectations I had after hearing her first two singles.. I expected more ""All You Wanted""s on the CD, but although the songs are good, some become boring after a while. I think that Michelle will be better on her next CD, because by then she will have found her style and stick to more upbeat tunes, like Everywhere. At first, I really liked this CD, but after a while, it gets a little boring. Now, I have to be in the mood to listen to the whole CD without skipping any songs. Nonetheless, it is worth your time and money, and is a good CD to check out and I recommend it. I give this CD a 'B'... maybe a B+. ENJOY!"
5,Michelle Branch is the BOMB!,"Michelle,Michelle Branch brings a heartfelt, spirit-driven, and refreshing sound to music today! I can listen to the entire CD without fast forward. Occassionally, a song here and there is put on repeat. The CD leaves your with an uplifting and ""keep it real"" feeling. This CD is great for completing a task, daydreaming, or going on a roadtrip."
5,Raw & True to the Soul: Welcoming Michelle Branch,"What a talent this teenage girl is- armed with a raw voice and the ability to write songs and play them on guitar, Michelle Branch has proven that she is truly a force to be reckoned with.Michelle's music is transcidental in meaning- it can be interpreted as an act of love, an act of faith, or the pure need to get her feelings and emotions out there. Wave the not-so-dirty laundry.The songs on this CD are stellar, especially her hit singles ""Everywhere"" and ""All You Wanted"", which is my fave song on the disc. Other songs that are outstanding include ""Something to Sleep To"" and ""Sweet Misery"".This young woman has brought back acoustic music to TRL (thank you, Michelle!), and a fresh sound and voice to an over-hyped, belly-button-baring industry. So, if you'd like to start riding the wave of independence in the music industry, this would be a good CD to start with."
5,Very rare among todays artists,"Michelle Branch's The Spirit Room is just amazing! It is so refreshing among todays teenybopper music to hear an artist who can actually sing,and writes their own stuff and plays their own music. I have to say my fave songs that stand out on the album are Goodbye to You,which is beautifully written,Sweet Misery,Drop in the Ocean and If Only She Knew.I do really like All You Wanted but I've heard it so many times,it bothers me. But overall,I definitely recommend this cd to those looking for something different than Britney."
2,Misleading...,"I was first exposed to Michelle on a late night ""live"" performance... I first heard Everywhere there and it had punch, and the influction in her voice brought the promise of something really new and interesting. However, after hearing the cd after purchasing, I must say, the rest of the album scarcely resembles the song that is indeed, everywhere. There are highpoints, the vocals and production is layered appropriately however the cd just quickly devolves into ""typical"". After ""Torn"" by Natalie and ""Taffy"" by Lisa Loeb I was hoping for more follow through as far as a ""complete"" cd. This is more a collection of chorus's with the verses being more of an after thought than something solid. If you like lite pop this may be a good cd for you though if you are expecting something a bit more raw, alive, and down to earth this isn't it. (...)you could do worse than the Spirit Room, but I can't reccommend it (**)."
3,"Some catchy tunes, but it's your usual teen angst nonsense.","Michelle Branch's ""Everywhere"" is cute and light, varied in its rhythms and thus catchy, but the rest of the CD, let's face it, doesn't make much of an impression.Because she's a pretty, sweet-voiced, confused, sometimes angry teenage girl, she sings songs that a confused, sometimes angry teenage girl would like. All the songs sound the same, with lyrics you can visualize written on the front of someone's notebook for math class.Her collaboration with Santana, currently Grammy-nominated and at the top of the charts, is better. The song's more mature and studied than anything on this album."
2,Got Boring Quick I Only Liked About 4 Tracks,1. Everywhere 4/52. You Get Me 1/53. All You Wanted 5/54. You Set Me Free 1/55. Something To Sleep To 2/56. Here With Me 2/57. Sweet Misery 2/58. If Only She Knew 2/59. I'd Rather Be In Love 4/510. Goodbye To You 2/511. Drop In The Ocean 4/5
4,She's got potential !,I bought this cd because of 'everywhere' and 'all you wanted' but soon realised that the whole album was quality- 'you get me' and 'sweet misery' are two examples. She has a great voice and the music goes well with the vocals. It is hard to describe a genre but she reminds me of alanis morisette ... only better! I would recommend this album to anybody looking for something a little different for the usual pop sound.
4,I love this CD!,This is one of the few CDs that I can listen to over and over again. There are only two songs that I really don't care for but the rest are amazing!
5,Seven stars!,"This is now my favorite CD in the world! I wish I could rate more than 5 stars. I simply love every single song on the album. They're all so good, but track 6, ""Here With Me"", is my favorite.The_decockster's review of this CD was, BTW, one of the best reviews I've ever seen; I bought this CD after I read it. Kudos!Love ya, Michelle!"
5,The Spirit Room Completed.,"The Spirit Room Completed.This cd is remarkable especially for our time!No Britney Spears wannabe, no little pop Princess (...)!This artist is one of a kind.She writes her own songs and is in touch with her spiritualside.Her voice is soul full her mind is unique and there's no fullon (...).Michelle Branch is an inspirational singer with loads of talent and determination.She may one day be a legend in her time and let's hope that many people will recognise such talent."
5,"well, michelle...","you have to get a new single out there so people can hear more of you!!!!! this album is so great. Arizona's new teenage wonder is climbing up the charts as we speak. ""the spirit room"" is an awesome album for the whole family. it's amazing how michelle can express her feelings in such an inspiring way. As she sings from her pencil on ""all you wanted,"" michelle teams up with friends for ""you get me,"" ""something to sleep to,"" and ""drop in the ocean."" They're all equally fantastic. michelle branch...don't forget those words in the upcoming years."
4,WOW! I am blown away by this singer,"Not since Macy Grey's debut album have I enjoyed thoroughly a debut album. Like Grey's album, I have listened to this continuously since I've gotten this CD. She's so talented for someone so young. What a great voice! You won't be disappointed with this purchase. Michelle Branch is an up and comer, she's not like all the other pop princesses, who just sing and wiggle. She's written all the tracks and plays the guitar. Trust me, get this album!"
1,What's going on?,"I submitted a review/question for this album 2 times, it should be posted here by now. Please post my review."
2,"Why Are There As on the Ends of All Her Words""","Instead of saying ""you,"" she says ""you-a."" Instead of saying ""everywhere,"" she says ""everywhere-a."" Am I the only one who notices this? I don't get why she does it, but I find it really anoying. I do like the song ""Goodbye to You"" a lot but the one on the album is an acoustic version and it doesn't sound as good as the radio version."
2,"Ok, but nothin special.","This cd can be sorta fun but only when you're singing along. I, personally, don't really enjoy her voice like some people here seem to. Her songwriting is shallow and unoriginal and so is her guitar playing. The overall product is sorta catchy but gets old really fast. I can't stand ""Sweet Misery"". That's just ..."
2,how much can we take,"how many more britney wannabe's can we stand come on now, when will this pop stuff end."
2,OVERRATED... DIDN'T SEE IT AT ALL,"i have owned the cd since i heard the second single ""all you wanted"". when i heard it ... i hated it. i really did. there is nothing in it at all that i liked. i only like a couple of songs, all of which were the singles and ""something to sleep to"" and the guilty pleasure ""you set me free""! the rest of the cd was basically torture.Luckily michelle saved her career with her sophomore effort HOTEL PAPER!! PEOPLE GET IT. BUY IT. EMBRACE IT!!"
4,Michelle Branch's The Spirit Room,"Michelle Branch shows an ability to write music, write lyrics, and play guitar.This album is quite nice, however I cannot say that Michelle herself is.My favorite is All You Wanted."
4,Michelle Branch kicks...,"I USUALLY DON'T LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC BUT SHE ROCKS!! WHEN EVERYWHERE WAS ON THE RADIO AND MTV I LOVED IT. SHE HAS THE BEST MUSIC EVER. WHO NEEDS A GRAMMY? MICHELLE BRANCH!!!!! I COULDN'T WAIT FOR HER CD. NOW THAT ITS HERE, I LOVE IT. THE ONLY RESON ITS NOT A 5 STAR IS BECAUSE USHER IS BETTER. BUT SHE KICKS A**."
3,Not too bad,"After hearing her song Everywhere, and after seeing all the good reviews, I was expecting a great CD. Mabie I had too high of expectations.There is a good variety of sound in this alblum, which is actually quite impressive. I also like her positive attitude. But the problem is that they are all love songs. There's nothing wrong with love songs per say, but when the whole CD is that, then the songs seem to become more the same as I listen.But she has excellent tallent, and I am looking forward to her next alblum."
5,One of the best CDs in my collection,"There is nothing worse than buying a CD because you like one of the artist's songs, just to discover that the rest of the songs are terrible! There is not one song on this CD I don't like. Very refreshing sound and originality. Especially love ""Drop in the Ocean."""
5,All I Wanted..Was For Everybody To Buy This CD & Her Poster,"Michelle Branch is a awesome songwriter, plays great with the guitar and the piano. She sings well. She has a beautiful voice. She's young and pretty. As a new fan of Michelle Branch, I would give her a 8 out of 10 for her prettiness. In some of her photos, she's is so hot and beautiful. The song called ""I'd Rather Be In Love"" should be part of the three hit singels including ""Everywhere"", ""All You Wanted"" and ""Goodbye To You"" ""Goodbye To You"" and ""I'd Rather Be In Love"" made me cry. These two songs are both sad and love in a way. I also like her videos. I can't wait to hear from her new album. I wish I can go to her concerts, or watch her perform on TV. I am getting her poster. I also want it to be autographed (signed). I recommend ""The Spirit Room"" to everybody in the world."
4,Where's the Radio Version!!!,"I thought most of the tracks were great, but the one track that I really bought this CD for was the RADIO VERSION, which I happen to LUV, of ""Goodbye To You"". I think the version on the CD is ok, but it's not nearly as emotional, expressive, and especially consistent, as the style that her other hits are."
4,very talented,"Michelle Branch is a very talented artist, all of the songs on this album are great and she has an excellent voice and is an awesome guitar player. There is a really good variety of styles and lyrics on her album and i think it is definitely worth buying."
5,I love it!!,"I bought this C.D. in 2002 and I still love it!1.Everywhere-5/52.You Get Me-5/53.All You Wanted-5/54.You Set Me Free-6/55.Something To Sleep To-3/56.Here With Me-4/57.Sweet Misery-5/58.If Only She Knew-4/59.I'd Rather Be In Love-4/510.Goodbye To You-5/511.Drop In The Ocean-2/5Overall,when you get this C.D.,also get these:Ashlee Simpson-Autobiography, Raven Symone-This Is My Time, Joss Stone-Mind,Body,& Soul, JoJo-JoJo, Ashanti-Chapter 2, Ciara-Goodies, Linkin Park-Meteora, Beyonce-Dangerously In Love, and of course,Michelle Branch-The Spirit Room.Oh yeah by the way,I don't have Ciara's album Goodies but I am going to get it for my birthday! I just know it will be great!Also go get Lindsay Lohan's new album Speak when it come's out December 7 2004! Bye!!!"
3,great pop cd,"The album lives up to its purpose - a ""breath of freshair in the midst of teen pop music""... so Michelle getscredit for writing good songs at the age of 14...I recently saw Michelle in concert and I could see whypeople in their college/high school years enjoy hermusic... it's very relatable to teens.If you're looking for a teen who, in my opinion,writes better lyrics... check out Vanessa Carlton,Katy Rose, or Shelby Starner."
4,"good album, good indeed..","Being a rock/classic rock/metal kinda guy, I generally dont get into the pop music too much, but Michelle Branch is an exception. I'm not sure why, but this album is just very appealing to me. This album is [girl] pop rock at its finest.Writing your own (very decent) lyrics + the ability to play guitar + good vocals = The Spirit Room.If you're into the girl pop rock type of music, this is a good one for you.One simple request, don't tell my (male) friends that I like this album."
3,One Time Charge,"There is just the real needfor owners of the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS to constantly recharge their batteries for the gameplay for those handhelds. While there are just so many different ways to keep the longevity fresh by buying backup batteries, or constantly recharging it from the sockets, Cellboost made a battery that seems like a entitly, but it just isn't for the die hard gamer. Their battery charger for the Nintendo DS and the Game Boy Advance, works well at charging the Nintendo game systems, but it is only for one particular use, not as a constant use for owners. Although it is a good idea, but it just is a waste of money. I strongly suggest you buy a backup battery for the Nintendo DS, or the Game Boy Advance instead.Price: B-Effeciency: C 1/2+Overall: C+"
3,"Interesting material, poor Execution","The material is extremely interesting; but the format of the book is too small to really appreciate the material, many of the images are split across the page and impossible to see in detail, and the reproduction of some is poor (Fuzzy, out of focus). Needs to be executed in a larger format with illustrations one per page"
3,font too small,"The content of this book is excellent so far--but it's frustrating to try to read the small font. If this book were reprinted with larger font, I'd buy copies for all my friends. I have never encountered such tiny font! That alone keeps me from ordering several copies. My copy is a library book. I had planned to read it, then order my own if I liked it. I would probably get it in Kindle edition, but there's not one. With a Kindle, at least, you can enlarge the font."
4,review all sorts maps,"Amusing collection of different sorts of maps. As well presenting mapping data as resolving problems in visualization of knowledge. Very inspiring for designers, writers and people ordering some information."
1,it was bad,"the book was bad. it was not a good book, so i thought it was bad. In one word, I would describe this book as bad. In two words I would describe this book as really bad. that about covers it."
1,Lucky Dog Tarp disintegrates in less than 1 year but the kennel is OK.,"I purchased the Lucky Dog 5 x 15 foot weatherguard Kennel Roof System less than a year ago from Atwoods and the tarp is disintegrating. It is shedding small silver flakes all over the place and has developed a large tear. This cover is in an open area that is not exposed to falling limbs or excessive pine straw, just a lot of hot Arkansas sun. I am very disappointed in this tarp because I have car covers, boat covers, motorcycle covers, propane grill covers, etc. that are several years old and they are holding up fine. This tarp didn't even last a year. I like the kennel, it wasn't to difficult to put together and it gives you the option of 5 x 15 feet or 10 x 10 feet. But I do not recommend this cover. You can purchase a much cheaper tarp that will hold up for several years."
3,Supplement vs. Replacement,"The ad was for CatSure Meal Replacement, and what we received was the Meal Supplement. I went ahead and used the product as we have difficulty finding this locally, but next time will ensure that what we receive is the meal replacement and NOT the supplement. Advice would be to contact seller to make sure what you receive is what was advertised and visa versa."
1,Didn't work for me.,"Bought this for a very sick cat whom I've been force-feeding for two weeks. She has thyroid cancer and can't swallow regular food, and I was hoping she would be able to lap it up, since she still drinks water. She would not drink it, so after reading a couple of reviews here I tried force-feeding her some. She vomited it back up within a couple of minutes (she doesn't vomit the other food).For comparison, I tried giving it to my healthy cat who loves everything. She wouldn't touch it, and when I rubbed some on her nose to give her a taste, she shied away from the saucer I set in front of her.I looked for an expiration date on the can, but found none, so I can't tell if it could be spoiled. It doesn't smell spoilied. Worst, I got this at PetCo, and paid $10 for a single can. So, neither cat liked it, and my sick cat couldn't keep it down. From other reviews, it looks like results vary."
5,Highly entertaining as well as informational,"Good basic instruction of how and why to journal. I have read many books on the subject, but this makes the most sense."
5,Obviously not for Idiots,"I usually bypass the ...for Dummies and Idiot's Guides but after reading this Idiot's Guide I might be looking at others more closely. This book is well-written and thorough, a very good compendium and probably the first journaling book to read before considering purchasing others. It details the many types of journals as well as the many reasons a person might want to keep one in the first place as well how as what to journal in and how to keep the writing private. It goes into specifics for each type of journal ('the unsent letter', for example, toward healing and resolution) and generally serves to enlighten one about journaling."
5,Helpful Beyond Belief,"As a Mormon, I've been trying to keep a creative and meaningful journal for years. I had so much I wanted to say, and say it well, but until I read this book, I had no idea how to do that. Now, with the information and ideas that this journaling book has given me, I'm keeping the kind of journal I've always dreamed of. I'm not only writing more creatively, but find myself leaning toward the more spiritual aspects of journal writing and growing. Give yourself the gift of this Idiot's Guide and quit feeling like an idiot."
1,Save your money,"I was disappointed with the lack of useful instruction in this book. There is evidence that the author had difficulty padding the material out to book-length (an entire chapter is devoted to weighing the merits of writing in a spiral notebook versus typing into a computer). When the book finally gets around to discussing the various types of journals to keep, it doesn't go into very much more detail than can be simply enough inferred by the chapter title.If you're looking for examples, they can all be found -- for free mind you -- in the sample pages ...As an aside, I am suspicious that these Idiot books may be written quickly to cash-in on whatever is ""hot"" at the moment. The Idiot's Guide to the Roman Empire for instance -- makes frequent mention of the movie ""Gladiator"". When I was reading this book, all I could think about was the sad possibility that someone at the publishing company thought it might be beneficial to cash-in on ""Bridget Jones's Diary""."
5,Sap Sago Cheese,"My father used to eat this cheese in his childhood years and loved it. He is now 77 years old and has been asking at all local supermarkets about how to obtain Sap Sago to no avail. He was very delighted when I found this product on Amazon.com...he had me order 2 for him. Once it arrived, he immediately had to try it and it was exactly as he remembered! Thank you so much for making it so easy to find and purchase this product of him."
5,BEST SUB BOOK OR SHALL I SAY TEACHING BOOK AROUND!,This book has it all for new subs like me! It was written by a Mother/Daughter team who has taught for over 35 years. It has tons of things to do to make up for non-existent lesson plans and even a much needed Sub List Kit on what subs should pack in their briefcase daily. It provided great ideas and some tried and true examples. They had everything in there that you could think of and also some sample situations that you can learn a lot from. It is a well thought out book and organized very nicely with cute little illustrations. I purchased the Teacher's Bag of Tricks and Instant Success in the Classroom (the yellow book) as well and they were mainly full of lessons plans (that were so-so) or Sponge Activities (most of which needed to be reproduced). They didn't provide any examples or practical advice at all. I would say stick with this book and you will definitely have your classroom going places!!!
4,Essential guide for substituting in the elementary grades.,"I bought this book as guidance as a new substitute teacher in high school and intermediate school. Although there are ideas that are helpful to these years, this book would be most helpful to a substitue teacher in the lower grades."
3,Great Book For New Subs,"I think this book would be great for new subs, but I was a little disappointed with the lesson plans. I've found myself in several situations where the teacher left me no instructions and I don't think these lesson plans would be very useful. It does have lots of great tips and some classroom management ideas though."
5,cookin' with the cleavers,"The best cookbook for a non expierenced cook such as myself. I found the recipes to be very easy to follow, with ingredients I have in my kitchen. I would recomend this book to any cook at whatever their level might be."
3,Partial accentuations,"Atmospheric ensemble can't help wear certain past and present influence when not pursuing wholly original territory, but strive for organically inspiring big band fusion nonetheless."
4,Very solid: nice extras.,"Pros: rubber analogue stick.main buttons feel very solidsame feel as the originalgiving the L and R trigger alternative buttons on the main face.Con: the D-pad seems a little stiff: but not an issue after playing a day.other people who played with this controller said they didn't noticethis, so it may just be a very personal thing.All that: and it works just like it should."
3,What Do I Expect?,"I've never done this but what can I say. I paid $3.00 plus a couple of dollars for S/H. I have not used it yet but if something happens to it, I go back to the old saying ""You get what you pay for"". Just to let everyone know, you will not get the controller pictured. The controller pictured is an official Sega brand controller. You will get a third party controller."
2,Devil seed. meh.,"Story line is the diner food of movies(nothing fancy, you know what to expect), but if you're doing a rehash- make it good. This was boring AND low budget- which for me is a unenjoyable.Moves slowly and honestly, I just don't care about the characters or who the evil entity is. I made myself watch the whole thing because comments based on a partially viewed movie are irritating and irrelevant.Verdict: 3.99 poorly spent."
3,Nothing Great,"Actual rating- 2.5Very middle of the road kind of movie. Not the worst low budget movie I have even seen but not the best either. The storyline is typical of possession type movies and lacks any true character development, the viewer isn't given anything to make them care for or about the charcters or the situation they find themselves. Also, there is no really story development beyond girl gets possessed, no explaination as to why it choose her, who the demon was, and so forth. One or two good jumps but over all wait untilit shows up on Prime (or Netflix) and watch it for free."
4,Made me jump several times!,Would recommend watching this just not by yourself ! . . . . . . . . . . .
2,Not a good,"Slow and to much of a remake of baby jane, very good trailer, poor movie, got bored to quick, sorry"
4,Better than some others...,"I've watched quite a few low budget horror movies. Devil Seed looks low budget at first, and in several scenes throughout. BUT, there are a number of VERY impressive SFX scenes. They are very impressive. The story works through the standard demonic possession story points. The writers and actors work these into a University campus scene well. The lead actress stands out of the pack. Overall, a fun movie."
3,Not original but not bad,"These actors did fairly well for being pretty much unknown. The story is nothing we haven't seen a lot before, and there should have been a bit more pay-off, but it is okay for a cheap rental."
3,SEED NO EVIL,"In the history of demonic possession films, only two have really impressed me---THE EXORCIST and THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE. Countless others have been thrust upon us, most of them derivative flops. DEVIL SEED is a low-budget entry that has an incredibly slow first half before achieving any modicum of suspense. Once that happens, it manages to involve the viewer's interest, saving it from being a total disaster.The cast of unfamiliar actors is merely adequate with no real standouts. No trend setting special effects.DEVIL SEED is worth a rental if nothing else is available."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money!!!!,"This movie was terrible!!!You could tell it was pieced together, using the premise from quite a few different popular horror movies of this genre.The acting was horrible!!And it was ridiculously predictable.Not to mention, it completely lacked the ""jump"" factor!!!Do NOT waste your time and money on this movie!!!!Believe me."
3,"Not bad, considering I've never heard of any of the actors","I love horror movies. Even the bad, cheesy ones. It's tough finding good demonic possession movies. I have had this on my watchlist for awhile, an decided to buy it the other day. The 3 main actresses, who play Alex, Jess, and Bree, are all pretty attractive (especially the blonde who played Bree). They all did a decent job with their roles. Most of the other characters (the teacher/adviser) and the boyfriend were a little cheesier. The scenes where the demonic possession was taking place were few, but mostly pretty well don. I could have just done with more of them. All in all, not bad. I would say it's worth a look (especially for the blonde whol played Bree...)"
5,Scary!,"This is a very good movie! Paranormal 1,2 & 3 don't have nothing on this movie. It's a must see!"
3,It was alright,I thought it had to do with supernatural but it wasn't. More like a guy hiding in a room so that the cops don't find him
4,A Wonderful Memory of A Long Lost Photography Gallery,"A few years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Helen Gee when she gave a talk before a New York City camera club. I greatly enjoyed both her great sense of humor and knowledge of photography, including its history. All of these are on display in her memoir. Although Helen Gee is not a great stylist, she tells her story in an engaging, conversational style. You share in her numerous disappointments and triumphs, as she struggles to survive as a young single mother, intent on pursuing a career in photography. The book is filled with humorous anecdotes about famous photographers such as Edward Steichen, Lisette Model, Robert Frank, and her problems with greedy landlords and petty gangsters. Anyone who wants an excellent view of life in Manhattan in the 1940's and 1950's as well as a glimpse into an important period in American photography will find this book quite captivating."
4,A modern classic,"My children loved this book: wonderful poetry, rhythm, imagery, and pictures covering a wide geography. This collection is a musical joy for babies & toddlers learning language and an early love of books."
4,"Requires slight ""tuning""","Purchased this knife to round out a set of other four star knives. As a Santoku, it has the classic rocker shape, long bevel on the cutting edge, and plenty of finger clearance. Not sure how effective the kullens are. As a Four Star knife, it is thinner than others in the set and has a more abrupt front bolster, both due to the Santoku pattern. Also, when it came in, the back edge and the edges of the bolster were very sharp and uncomfortable to use. I burnished them off with my sharpening steel to make the knife comfortable to use. Now ""tuned"" it's an excelent addition to my set. Selected the 7 inch over the 5 inch on a hunch and glad for the size."
5,The sharpest knife I have ever owned!,"I had always wanted one of these knives, and finally caved in and purchased one. I cannot believe how quickly I can cut up a chicken! It takes one tenth the time as with my other ""sharp"" knives. And, I was able to easily cut through beef ribs to separate them before cooking. If you are tired of wrestling with difficult meat joints, this is the knife for you! I give it 5 stars!"
4,My Henckels 7-Inch Santoku Knife,"I love this knife. It makes slicing of anything so easy. The knife feels a little heavy, but I am all right with it. I find myself taking this knife out to slice everything. I have actually become a better slicer, since using this knife. I would recommend this knife to anyone who wants a good quality knife that is not too expensive."
4,"Awesome Knife, except maybe the handle","We were given this knife for a wedding present from a family member who knows I am pretty hard on knives (*I expect them to do well with all foods, I don't expect it to second as a gardening or handyman's tool), I was hesitant at first after reading some other negative reviews about this knife. I have been very pleased with it over the last 18 months. I am very impressed with Henckel's as a company, have found them to be good and easy to work with when I had a problem with some other utensils that broke after initial usage. Overall, this has become a ""go-to"" knife in our kitchen.I didn't give this knife the fifth star because I personally feel the handle could have been made slightly more comfortable, I wish it had a slightly less ""fitted"" feel, but that could just be my preference, or my wide hand."
1,disappointed long time user,"I have owned the set of 4 star knives for many years. Last year, my husband added this knife to our set. I love the weight and it has quickly become my go-to knife. I ""collect"" kitchen tools and know how to treat them with respect. All of my cookware and cutlery is hand washed and immediately dried. Nothing but dishes and utensils go into the dish washer.However, today the blade chipped while cutting chicken thighs. There is an entire piece of blade missing and I will probably have to throw out the chicken since I can't find the metal.I will contact Henckels on Monday to determine their warranty procedure. I hope to update this review with a five star response!"
3,What's with the edge?,I have purchased Henckels knives in the past and have always been pleased. This knife is different. The edge was poorly honed and had a tremendous burr which required considerable stone work to polish off. The edge itself seems to have a indented section and the bolster is poorly fashioned. Perhaps I have purchased a poor knife out of an otherwise perfect lot but at these prices I expect more.
2,Questionable Blade Quality,"I own many Henckels Four Star Series knives and while I am a fan of the Santoku style knife, I have to say I am a bit disappointed with the blade life of this model. After routine use the blad has become somewhat pitted and uneven. I've never had a similar event occur with any of my other Henckels knives and I haven't subjected this knife to any particularly harsher treatment or maintenance.I don't know if the hollow edge is to blame or I just received a defective design, but I was unexpectedly disappointed."
1,amazingly poor quality,"We got this knife as a part of a large set to replace our Henckels TwinStar set that got dull to the point of being unusable and could not be honed. After a little more than a month of light use the blade cracked! Mind you, we've life-long owners of fine quality knives, they're carefully hand-washed and dried immediately, so there's no abuse on our part. Of course since it was purchased a little over a month ago Amazon won't take it back for exchange, so we're stuck dealing with the manufacturer and paying money to ship it back for ""inspection"" before they even consider getting it replaced. What a joke. I expected better from Henckels, I guess i'll be going with Shun for the next set."
4,Indie Horror Worth A Look,"Torment is a low-budget horror film from director Steve Sessions. I played a supporting role in the film as one of the victims so I may be a little biased in my review.For the budget it had, the movie looks great. Suzi Lorraine pulls off a convincing portrayal of a woman who falls deeper and deeper into a world of a serial killer offing locals which may or may not be actually happening. Until her husband (Tom Stedham) is murdered, then what was thought to be all in her head becomes a living nightmare.This has all the classic elements of a psychological slasher film. The final half hour really kicks into gear and is a non-stop thrill ride until the very end.For such a small cast, I can assure you there is a high body count. This film uses the ""torture porn"" aspect but those scenes are pretty low key and not too disturbing.Rent it or buy it when it comes out. All who were involved worked extremely hard on it and had an awesome time making it."
4,Awesome B-Flick!,"I really liked this movie. I was a shrink, so the main characters being psycho really appealed to me. Of course, my friend Tom Stedham is in it as well, so I'm heavily biased in my opinion.Get over a couple of lighting issues, though, and you have a very solid B-movie. With a creepy clown. Scary!"
1,missing debris screens...not as advertised,"I ordered 3 of these as I found them hard to locate. The filters are advertised with debris screens. Not a single one came with the debris screen. I am assuming the seller has kept them or given them away and is still selling these at full price. I have had to reuse the screen from my original filter. Luckily it was salvagable. Good delivery, bad service to remove the screens."
4,Works Very Well,"I bought this replacement for my Shark Hand Vac after SOMEONE borrowed it and threw away the filter with the trash that the vacuum picks up. The filter works very well, however, I would suggest that shark makes the filter attached so it cannot be accidentally thrown away so easily.All in all, the shark and the filter that comes with it is very handy and easy to clean. I'd recommend it."
5,It's a filter!,What can one say? It's a filter! It fits perfectly and does what it's supposed to do. No issues what-so-ever.
2,"Wasn't the worst, definetly wasn't the best","I got the phone because it was small but I didn't know I'd be sacrificing so much. The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. I get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing. All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone."
1,bad experience,"Bought this from a local Cingular store. Took it home and wasted one evening trying the decipher the WORLD'S WORST (in my opinion) instruction manual. Couldn't even enter my address book. It gets returned tomorrow. It looks to me as if the instruction manual was translated by software directly from the Korean. In contrast, my old Motorola Star Tac manual was complex but logical and reasonably intuitive."
4,A good basic phone,"If you want a good basic, flip phone, I think this is a good one. It does not have all the ""extras"" touted by some but it has good sound quality and performs well."
1,Worst cell phone ever?,"Yes, I would say this is the worst phone I ever had. Every problem mentioned has occurred while I attempted to use this phone. It constantly dropped calls and had to search for the sim card. Some of the most important and basic concepts of a cell phone have been overlooked on this product. It should have never been put on the market. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE JUST BECAUSE IT IS FREE WITH A PLAN. You will regret it if you do. I'm going back to a Nokia."
4,If you are clumbsy like me...this is your phone...,I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine..
1,This Phone is Horrible!!!,"I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls. They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't. The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly. Don't buy this phone!"
1,Random Dropped signal and calls,"This crazy phone will frequently go from full-scale signal to dropping a call while standing in one place. When it happens, the screen goes blank and there is a 20-30 sec delay as it figures out where it is and gets a signal back. Meanwhile you've lost a call. Could be at the beginning of a call or anytime thereafter.Also will give random errors when looking up a number from the contacts list. Frequently comes back with 'error reading smart chip'. Usually have to shut it off and 'reboot'.It is basically a piece of junk."
1,20% good/ 80% bad,"We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year. Very inconsistent service. When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was ""blacklisted"". After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500. We were told it was ""like for like"" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand. If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!!"
2,"Think ""limited""","If you want an inexpensive phone that will do VERY little other than make/receive calls, this phone is adequate. If you like to do ""complicated"" things with your phone, like (gasp!) change your ring tone from time to time, don't bother with this phone.I paid $18 for this phone. That was about the upper limit of its value."
4,Nice basic phone,"I've had this phone for a few weeks now, and it gets the job done. It's not a flashy phone for those looking for all the latest features, but it does have a IM capabilities, a couple standard games and decent ringtones. My one complaint is that the phone drops calls easily when there is only one bar of service; I'd prefer if it just told you that there wasn't enough signal strength to make the call in the first place. Overall though, the phone is well made and is of good quality and I recommend it to those looking for a basic entry level phone."
1,9 months - many problems,"We bought 2 phones on a family plan last October. We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed. Our major use was to communicate between each other. We were happy for for about 5 months. Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned. Our phones were replaced during April. One sim card was replaced during June. Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone. Another replacement phone is on the way to us. The major problems have included ""service not available"" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, ""unable to read"", ""insert card"", and of course dropped calls. Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call. At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution. I can not depend on it. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Phone constantly reboots,"It's a cheap phone and you get what you pay for.I bought 3 of these for my kids a week ago. Within a couple of days I returned 2 of them because they kept recycling. The third phone is now acting up and one of the 2 replacement phones is also acting up. That's 4 out of 5 phones exhibiting this flaw. I'll be swapping these LGs for something more reliable like a Nok or Moto. No more LGs for me.Some of the others here noted things like the phone making noises and the screen lighting up for no reason. That's the phone recycling and it does it for no reason. Next time it does it, look at the display and you will see that your bars go away. If you happen to be on a call when it does this, it disconnects you.In the last week, I've invested way too much time diagnosing this problem for Cingular. I can force the phone to recycle just by holding it near my MP3 player, or laptop.I have a Moto V3 Razor and it works flawlessly."
5,Great help,I have no problem with this headset. It is clear and leaves the hands free.If these break after a decent length of time I will try to purchase another set of the same thing.
2,Head set was inoperative,"The headset, as received did not function. When I reported this to the supplier, I received a prompt and agreeable disposition. I would not recommend this headset, but have no qualms about doing further business with the vendor."
1,No mute,"The description for this item says ""speaker mute function."" This apparently means that it mutes the speaker on the handset it is connected to. There is no mute feature on the headset. Also, even with the volume on the phone at its highest I can't hear some calls very well. There is no volume control.Given the lack of features, this is way overpriced."
4,simple and good,"Just plugged it in and it worked on my cordless home phone, The lack of a in-cord volume is a missing convenience. The head set is so comfortable that I forget I have it on. My wife has to point it out. It is odd that I can't hear my own voice over it when I am speaking as others have. Just got used to it and now I am hooked. highly recommend it - and hope they add an in-cord volume and mute control."
5,Excellent bracelets and worth the money,"I read the reviews and I had to give it to a bunch of girls in my family. I ordered 10 of these and it arrived in good packaging and on time. Everyone liked it and for the money, this is a great gift. If you are looking to distribute it for a large crowd, this is very affordable. The stones are attached to a stretchable rubber band. One size fits all."
5,why only 5 stars?,"oh yes, i think this book is more than 5 stars. not only because of its quality, but because it represents mafalda's life, and that's something more than just 5 stars. read it, love it, think it, laugh it, recognize yourself in this book!"
5,"Witty, smart and critical","Nobody can see the world better than mafalda, the most sarcastic kid in the world. Life in the eyes of mafalda and her friends is real, crude and funny."
5,A must for everyone,"Mafalda is probably the most intelligent cartoon ever written, it transcends time."
3,Battery Mismatched,"I bought 3 Canon A70 recently from amazon. I also bought an olympus B-70su 2100mah battery charger from another site, What I don't understand is that only one camera accepts the Olympus Battery, The others told me to Change the Battery Packs. I understand Olympus states that only Olympus products are to be used with the Olympus battery. But a battery is supposed to be universally accepted. 2100 mah is a lot of power. specially if you scuba dive and dont want to change the battery on the boat while you're still dripping."
3,Where are the extra tracks listed in the title on Amazon?,"Better sound than the first CD issued, but I feel gyped as the title says extra tracks but there are no extra tracks as the original had 9 and so does this version.Even the music samples indicates for those who remember the original number of tracks that were present, that in fact, no additional tracks are included whatsoever, whatever happened to truth in advertising?"
2,An Eroica lacking in heroism,"when one of the most dramatic statements in the history of music and art is belittled by the assertivness of pedantic musicology ( acting here as a substitute for deep artistic feeling and understanding), the outcome can only be disappointment; and disappointment it is."
2,"Good Overview of the Epic- But ""Classic"" Art?","This book is put out by ISKCON, and includes an excellent summary of the epic for those unfamiliar with it (including an overview of the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by ISKCON). However, the title is misleading- this book does not include pictures of ""classic"" renditions of the Mahabharata, but photographs of s modern sculpture in New Delhi called ""Glory Of India"" (apparently sculpted by the author) paired with sketches by the author. So if you are looking for a short version of the epic that it fairly read-able, great; if you want classic sculpture, not so great (and the art that is show is fine, but not fabulous)."
1,Pejorative towards Native Americans,"Since the book was written in 1939, I did expect some bias, but the way Allis refers to Abenakis so insultingly - for instance calling them ""John Redskin"" and ""of childlike imagination"" - just made it repulsive."
3,Missing Stop,Did not come with the round stop. They are definately showing a different item than the one I got and I see others had the same issue.
2,"Too many errors, factual, historical, literary...","It's hard to take this work seriously when it's so full of errors. The author became a self-proclaimed Brazilianist overnight and it shows. A good ethnography requires more than what went into this work, although it's an interesting topic and a great job of anthropological showboating."
2,Routina,"This book doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. Also it tries to interpret events. Anybody with internet access can read about favelas of Rio and the ""parallel government"" that rules the shanty-towns.In fact, at least two groups in Rio give tours of these slums. And you will find things quite peaceful (the tour operators have not been injured in over 15 yrs of giving tours).In a word: it's all about (drug) money."
5,"Great book, and Great price also.","I purchased several of these books for friends (Through Amazon), all were well pleased with the quality of the books. The books are the older copies, but just like the new printed copy of the book, and at a give away price. Thanks so much from all"
5,A Taste of Foreign Luxury,Some of the finest ham I've eaten.We keep it around to serve to guestswith cheese and crackers. My Wifeand like it with apples or pears.
2,Meh,Just meh. There are many other artists that do this genre with more interesting arrangements. I wouldn't run out and purchase it.
5,His best album ever!!,"I don't know what a world music is.This album is like listening to a whole season of concerts in one sitting.Randy performs on two rare Michael Jacobson-Hardy handmade cutaway guitars, as well a 1948 vintage Gibson L7 jazz guitar and a Godin Jazz Multiac synth-guitar. In addition, he deftly coaxes echoes from cultures around the world playing the North Indian sitar and tabla, West African djembe, balafon, djun-djun, Lakota flute, and other instruments which he plays with equal virtuosity.Nobody can define his music as a world music. He explores a genre-defying variety of styles, including jazz, world fusion, western classical counterpoint, flamenco, North Indian, and Native American."
2,This is for middle school children,This book is sooooooooooooooooooooooo basic thank god I didn't rely on this soley. Save your money this book is not worth it.
3,Sizing (US) for Adidas,"Purchased a pair of Anzo Mid Slip-Ons but the sizing is a bit small. This is my second Adidas purchase via Amazon and I wanted to leave a review to inform others about sizing (US). For both purchases, the actual shoe is about half or even one size SMALLER than what I expected. Not knowing better, I bit the bullet with my first pair and kept using them as a casual pair around the house, but will return my Anzo's since I had planned to take them on walking-intensive traveling.The shoes appear well put together and feel relatively light, pretty much how I had imagined them to be per the site's description. I wish the sizing chart had info to take into the consideration this sizing difference so that I could have ordered half or one size larger."
3,nice reading,Igor's passion for artificial consciousness is well known. This book talks more of philosophy than the engineering behind his passion. It has some intersting imaginary dialogues with some of the pioneers in the theory of consciousness. It stirs more questions than it answers. Nevertheless its a good read.
5,amazing indie post-rock,i have seen pele and heard them the tracks on this album are beautiful and harmonious. very smooth and enjoyable
3,"Good concepts, bad writing","I am currently using this book as a text for a graduate level game theory course for political scientists. Although Morrow does a good job covering the important concepts, the writing is wordy, awkward, and confusing. It makes it difficult to follow some of the more complicated problems, especially when learning the ideas for the first time. I would only recommend this book for people who already have a grasp of the ideas and want to learn more and see examples -- not so useful for first-time game theorists."
3,Answer keys are a little bit questionable.,"There are apparently two versions floating around (from the same edition and same printing) with different answer keys in the back for some of the more difficult problems.Otherwise, this is the standard textbook for game theory for political science. I'm inspired to read Schelling!"
5,Her best album?,"At first I thought some of the lyrics were a bit cheezy, but now I'm embracing every part of this album. What I thought was cheezy seems to be part of the ""confessions."" It's completely fantastic."
4,Bad Reviews are from Mariah Carey Fans,"Mariah Carey, the stuffed sausage dog whistle, has sites that give links to reviews of other female singers telling her fans to write bad reviews. This is so immature. In any case, here's a true, valid review of this album: It's musically amazing, but the rating has to be slightly downgraded because of its lyrics in some songs. ""I Love New York"" is hard to listen to because it's Madonna trying so hard to be something she's not. However, she completely makes up for it with musical masterpieces, such as ""Sorry"" and ""Jump"" which are riveting and live in your head long after the songs stop playing. ""Isaac"" is not the controversial track it was made out to be. It's actually very fun and spiritual.In any case, don't listen to the bad reviews on here. They are planned from the stuffed sausage fans."
1,Bad Confessions,"Madonna shoulda Stayed away from the spotlight..After such great records in 2005, Her Confessions is seriously lacking the Originality it needs to stand out..The songs ALL sound the same and the Music is recycled and feels very plastic.."
2,It's OK,"It's cute fluffy nonsense that is a little more than derivative. The music is fun but someone needs to tell Madonna to stop writing her own lyrics. I cringed when I heard ""I Love New York"", I wonder how many sleepless hours she had in front of her laptop before she decided that ""dork"" and ""New York"" was a great rhyme."
1,Oh Please..... What Happened to You???,"Ok, I tried to understand. I listened to the album several times before i pass judgement but unfortunately it did not work. This is a lame album compared to American Life and Ray of Light.I always have high hopes when it comes to her album but i was quite dissapointed with this one. Why? She sounded like a trying hard Kylie Minogue or a Sophie Ellis Bextor wannabe.The tracks:Hung Up- ripped the first part of Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba. Great Idea, bad lyrics.Get Together- is this Love At First Sight part 2? ..Sorry- this sounded like an old Erasure songand so on and so forth... Final judgement? Forget About this album. Look for other albums instead."
1,I confess: this should be wiped off the face of the earth-yuk yuk triple yuk!!!,"Hi muzak hatersI confess: this should be wiped off the face of the earth-yuk yuk triple yuk. This lame music has been intensely UNinteresting for several decades.Cloathe the Volts, enough is enoughTake a little do a little and run"
1,Stuck in the 70'S,"This ALbum is total trash, the only good track is ""Get Together"" Other than that...........its totally not worth it. But everyone writing reviews are madonna queens so they will enjoy anything she puts out. If she sang lalalalalalalalal boom boom, theses idiots would be like oh my god number one dance track since bedtime stories!!! Unfortunately I have to give it 1 star or else amazon wont let me post it!"
5,She's in a League of Her Own!,"This is another incredible example of how Madonna can breathe life and emotion into Electronica. Her lyrics are one the money and tell about things that everybody can relate to. Also, unlike a lot of Pop/Dance music, she always has prefect diction so there is no guessing what she is saying.The music itself is extremely complex, blending classic instruments with synth. She is constantly pushing the envelope on what can be done with music.To those who don't like her, I have to say: ""Your jealousy is transparent, and will never make you better than the sole of her shoe"". Obviously, you are not listening with an open mind, and your hatred will destroy you."
5,Feeling Like an Energized Bunny!,I love this collection of delicious songs. Try them and you'll find yourself satiated.
2,Repeated boredom,"I personally found this CD to be repetitive. Seeking a group decision I took it to work where 20 other people, ages 20 to 45, kept looking at me asking why should they be tortured listening to my mistake purchase. I can take the Euro/Techno sound but give me a little variety. I swear they used only one maybe two pads on the drum kit, no bass drum. I would also say they only used about a quarter of the whole keypad of the synth. The lack of any muscians( check the last page of the inner sleeve, only the last song used guitars), proved to be too much as I had to remove this after about seven songs. I kept thinking of Cher's ""Believe"", but most of the songs on this CD are slower in tempo and beat. As with most strictly club CD's this loses all of its appeal outside of a club when most of the listeners are sober."
1,What A Let Down!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Madonna, Who wrote the lyric's?? Your Kid's?? I have always been a fan and bought all your albums. But I am not with you on this one. I can't believe that this Album is being compared to Ray Of Light. Ray Of Light was a work of Art, this is just ok at best. I understand that this is a dance album, but can't we have a little more thought and meaning in the lyric's?? And what is going on with your voice? Well I guess you don't need one if there is nothing to say. I just think your better than this."
2,Just didn't cut it,"Hung Up was a darn good song and mostly because of the ABBA sound. It is strange that a CD that started so well ended up so badly. I listened to the entire thing and had to hit the forward button because there was no way to make it through song #4 it was so awful. The song Push was about as pleasant as a police siren. I Love New York was just mostly her hollaring ""get off my street"" about a hundred times. Issac sounded like classical music speeded up with an Arab guy singing in the background and ends with him uttering something that didn't make sense about the gates of heaven and ""that's what it's about"" It is a weird CD and not worth the money. Her career ended with Ray of Light and everything else is now just making CD's just to make them knowing it will sell because her name is attached to it. Also her loose butt flapping in the Hung Up video didn't help"
5,Sheer enjoyment!,"I have to admit that I was very skeptical at the thought of Madonna's release of a ""dance""-type CD, as I am a bigger fan of her earlier stuff than her most recent compilations (i.e. American Life). Boy was I wrong! I am happy I went off of the other reviews on Amazon and by what others around me were saying by going out and purchasing it, this CD is truly terrific! I have been playing it in my car for three days straight, it's great for lifting your mood and giving you a sense of renewed energy. Shame on me for not thinking the Material Girl still had ""it"" in her, I am happy to say that I was proven wrong!"
5,"Pulsating, amazing, one of her best.......","Madonna's new album is absolutely amazing from beginning to end and you cant help but want to dance for the whole hour of music. Being a huge fan of Madonna for just about her whole career, I am always ecstatic when she puts out a new album. I must say that ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" is already my new favorite Madonna album and I have only had it for 2 days. This is a must own album for any Madonna fan (duh) to anybody who loves to dance, and sing and get up and do thier thing!!! Congrats Madonna, this ROCKS!!!!!"
1,Waste of money!,"Wow, I couldn't believe how bad this was after all the hype and great reviews! I own a lot of Madonna's earlier work, most notably the Immaculate Collection. Now, that's dance music. This is boring, droning, repetitive, mechanical and monotonous. It reminds me of a broken record, every song blends into the next until 45 minutes later, you realize how bored and tired of the whole affair you are. It ain't disco folks, it's ""Techno"" and it stinks. Anyone who calls this a return to form or even suggests it's disco music is either under 21 years old or needs the wax removed from their ears! A real piece of crap. This will let you know why the music business is hurting."
1,This is a Horrible attempt at Dance.,"Leave it to the Europeans Honey!Jump 9/10Very catchy, dancy song. One of the shorter tracks that could've been longer."
5,Her confessions are welcome!,"She definitely knows how to reinvent herself. ""Confessions"" is a collection of fresh and new songs that just fit very well on a dancefloor. My favorite ones are ""Jump"" (her vocal in this song is amazing), ""Get together"" and ""I love New York"", although ""Hung up"", ""Let it will be"" and ""Isaac"" makes you feel like dancing.Madonna proves once again that she is the most influent and impressive singer of pop and dance music."
3,Back To The Floor,"With her 14th studio album, Madonna again reinvents herself. This time around the musical stylings are the 70's disco diva sounds that she helped to overthrow with her first albums in the mid 80's. ""Hung Up"" is the album's first single and opening track and is the best song on the album. The song is catchy and fun and is her best single since ""Don't Tell Me"". ""Get Together"" has a moody synth beat and ""Sorry"" has a thumping bass line. ""Future Lovers"" finds Madonna equating music & dance to spirituality and religion. Confessions On A Dance Floor is a good album, but not groundbreaking."
3,Must hear the CD more than once,Must hear the CD more than once to like the music. Still American Life is a better CD. Here are my favorites tracks:Hung Up - What can I say......DISCO!!!Future Love - Its Donna Summer on drugsHow High - Perhaps the best trackLet It Will Be - Excellent - between this and How high track - heck play it back to backForbidden Love - Madonna will be in your dreams when you listen to this great track - this is my personal favoriteJump - More Pop oriented dance .....Push - Amazing beat - Very FunkyLike It Or Not - This is the future DISCO BeatHere are the others so so tracks:Get Together - has potential - but I passSorry - just okI love New York - WhateverIssac - Forget this song.....Final Score: 8 out of 12 - Approx: 66.66%Overall - I am a little disappointed.....It shows you never believe the hype until you hear it yourself
3,"Not as good as I hoped for, not as bad as I feared",This will make die-hard fans happy but those who have yet to be hooked by Madonna will not be converted by this one. I find it okay.
1,Special Edition Reduction...,"This Special Edition was ill conceived. The Bonus Track is good for all hardcore Madonna fan's, but this packaging is an utter disgrace. The journal is cheap and the entry is just lyrics from a song off the album. The photo book is okay, bigger than the artwork for the standard cd, but lacking. And don't expect lyrics either for all the tracks. Overall this is uninspired with no real special qualities. If you are collector get it, if not download the song elsewhere. Hopefully there will be another Limited Edition with more extras...take a cue from other artists Madonna and WBR."
3,"No Revelations in ""Confessions""","I've been a fan of Madonna's music from day one, largely in part because her music has always transcended just being entertainment. Until now. This is the first album that seemingly relies on a past-proven formula of success, rather than to blaze a new and interesting trail. As such, it is a good dance music album, however, one that could have been released by a number of good dance music artists. Can it be that Madonna has become just another face in the music crowd?"
4,A much-needed return to form,"This is definitely the Madonna we've been missing, but didn't even know it. No more politics, thank the Lord. Though admittedly, most of the sound of this album isn't anything Kylie Minogue hasn't been doing for years overseas. Oh well, most U.S. listeners will never know the difference."
5,AMAZING CD!!! MADONNA IS HERE TO STAY!!!!,This one of Madonna's best cd's. Sorry is my favorite song on the album and trust me it's hard to pick one out when they are all so excellent. This dance only cd is a must have for everyone that loves listening to music. I love it!!!
4,*F*A*B*,"This is one of the best albums I own. It is exceeding all expectations I had of it, and it certainly lives up to all the hype it made. Much better than 2003's ""American Life"""
5,I'm so in love with this album I just don't get tired of it,I purchase this cd when it first came out november 15 2005 and since then I can not stop listing to it I hear it every day and it was like yesterday I ran to the store right after work and got it madonna your the best thank you for a great year to me it's my favorit cd. you should buy it if you like dance music I recomend
5,Great!!!,"Fantastic album from Madonna here. This is definately her best yet, second is Like A Prayer. The album features the smash top ten Hung Up (which reached No.1 in the UK) and the new single Sorry. I can't speak about favs as I have far too many! Buy it---non-Madonna fans will be suprised by this great dance effort from the Queen of Pop!"
5,BILLBOARD MAGAZINE review can't get better!,"The diva has returned to the disco. The swirling, throbbing and altogether great ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" is Madonna's nonstop ecstatic cabaret. The 12-song set takes some of its musical cues from the likes of Giorgio Moroder and Richard X, though it remains thoroughly and uniquely a work of Madonna, who never gets lost in the dizzying beats and dense production. The tunes focus on self-discovery (""How High""), enlightenment (""Future Lovers,"" ""Get Together""), empowerment (""Jump"") and love (""Push""). There are also fluffier cuts: a rocking dance anthem in ""I Love New York,"" the ABBA-sampling lead single ""Hung Up"" and the springy ""Sorry."" In the wake of 2003's dead-on-arrival ""American Life,"" ""Confessions"" is a welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop. -Keith Caulfield"
4,A Madonna album that I actually like!,"Like somebody said before, this is a album for people who dont really like Madonna. All the die-hard Madonna fans who complain about the songs all sounding the same are not use to listening to techno,drum & bass,industrial,trance,etc. On first listen, this is what a good electronic dance album should sound like(one long continuous song)& after repeated listens the songs start to show themselves. If you hate Madonna but like electronic music & can listen to this album without thinking about her celebrity life you might really enjoy this."
1,Dissapointed,"I never received the cd ""Confessions on the Dance floor"". I have called twice. I hope I can get someone to help me."
2,This is NOT as good as I thought it would be.,"There is One good song on this c.d and that is Hung Up..and maybe Sorry is alright, but this sounds very dated, like really bad 80's cheese..save your mony folks...Reccommended Instead of this washed-up trash:carrie Underwood-One HeartKate Bush-Aerialmariah Carey--Ultra Platinum Edition of Mimi"
3,Confessions of a Fan,"I confess I'ts ok. But its not all that great. I was really hoping for more. Many of the songs sound alike. I think shes lost it for the most part, and needs to hang it up. But nonetheless I'm glad to file another on my cd rack (this one will not be in my cd changer)"
2,This album would be great....if Madonna didn't sing,"Am I the only one here who thinks that Madonna is a hack with absolutely no talent and an ego the size of Jupiter?!I listened to this album because my friend requested me to pick out some good songs for her wedding reception party (!!)I went through the entire album and found myself bobbing my head to the amazing beats [who unlike Madonna actually HAVE talent and produce absolutely awesome stuff]. I loved the songs....that is, until Miss Diva started singing.I'm sorry-I don't mean this to sound like a rant but frankly I'm so tired of people telling me that Madonna is some sort of musical genius because she really isn't. I guarantee you that if you are looking for insightful lyrics or complexity...this is definetely not the album for you. However if you're looking for something light and something that you can maybe sorta dance to [some of the songs are really weird to dance to in my opinion], then buy this album.A classic it is not."
2,Great Effort. Not Much Delivery success..,"Madonna has never been 100 % original. She has always borrowed ideas from other artists but she usually masked those ideas with her own originality. Unfortunately, on this album, she does not even hide her blatant borrowing and it seems she is running out of steam. She borrows ideas from ABBA, The Jacksons, Kylie, The Police, GoldFrapp, and Donna Summer. She even borrows ideas from her former glorious self. Part of Madonna's problem is she is relying too heavily on Euro Pop. Since Ray of Light, Madonna has used Euro Pop to mask other things she has been lacking. What's lacking are passion and energy in her voice and meaningful and creative lyrics. Clearly, Madonna at 47 is at a crossroad...she needs to make a decision on continuing to be Queen of Pop or just another Euro Pop female singer. Having said that, this cd is not bad but it is not to the level that we expect from Queen Madonna."
5,You go Madonna,"Someone must have gifted Madonna from birth, because honestly, love her or hate her, who has done more? 2,000 years from now when people are studying our culture, Madonna will be listed- she is an icon. And personally, I have had her album on my MP3 player for like, three months now, and it is addictive. Her lyrics on this are classic Madonna with a sense of maturity. I feel righteous dancing to this. I personally think it is highly adventurous to keep picking up styles and turning them into your very own flavor- it is incredible to me. Keep on keepin on, Madonna-"
2,It was what I expected...,This cd from Madonna is okay...if you are a fan of techno music. That's what it is basically consisted of. I just like Hung Up.
5,Great CD!,"Hung Up 10/10 the best song on the CD!Get Together 10/10 Good song, I like it!Sorry 10/10 I love this song, very good!Future Lovers 10/10 This is a very dancy song, love it!I Love New York 10/10 I love this song tooLet it Will Be 10/10 Nicely done song, not the best trackForbidden Love 10/10 I like this song, very good!Jump 10/10 nicely done, nice beat too!How High 10/10 love this song! Really good!Issac 9/10 werid song, Nice song though and its a long song tooPush 10/10 Diffrent song, like it!Like It Or Not 10/10 I really like this song!All of the songs on this CD are good, if you don't have this CD, go out and buy it! It is an awesome CD, this is a CD that you can believe the hype on. Go to your nearest store that sells CDs and buy it, you won't be dissapointed!"
2,madonna has lost her edge,"I bough this CD with the hopes that it would be great. After all, the two singles that came out on the radio (Sorry, Hung Up) were awesome. The rest of the songs, though????? Not so much. I was incredibly disappointed to find that those two songs were the only ones I liked. And, I already can hear those for free. The other songs were just boring beats and lyrics that were either spoken word (weird) or when sung, they weren't sung well. I have only listened to it all the way through once, and don't even remember where I put it after. That was a few weeks ago....Needless to say, I haven't looked for it. Seems to me that, just like her concerts, this CD was way over-priced. Not worth it at all. Buy the single"
5,Madonna is back,This album is a masterpiece of work. Madonna has went above and beyond with this album. I have been waiting a long time for Madonna to put a complete dance album out and it has arrived. I love that all the music runs together without a miss of a beat. Way to go Madonna!!
5,"Well Madge, Ya Done It AGAIN!!!!","I am a HUGE Madonna fan, so I'll try to be as unbiased as possible. I have followed her career since she started and I always look forward to what she offers next! Madonna has always had a remarkable instinct of knowing exactly what the music world needs, exactly when it needs it! She has rescued us from the clutches of the very tiresome rap and hip-hop. If you don't get up and dance ... or at least WANT to.... you MUST be dead! The music is ingeniously layered with non-stop DANCE beats. Though the CD is not as fun as I thought it would be, it's still F'ing FANTASTIC !!!"
5,I still can't get enough of the music,I can't stop playing this I have an unhealthy obsession of playing this at least once a day or else my day sucks. Hearing dance music get you through life can be a beautiful thing.
5,mimi may be best selling of the year BUT,this album came out a little over a month ago and so far people I know prefer this over the mimi CD. Once 2006 arrives madonna will continue to release more singles with music videos and go on tour and then we'll see who had the more entertaining career comeback
3,Disco Meets Techno,"This is one of Madonna's most unique albums. She's reinvented herself yet again. And this time she's introduced a new sound that we've never heard on previous Madonna records. It sounds like a mix of 70's disco and techno/trance. After listening to the album several times from beginning to end, I've formed mixed feelings about it. The songs blend together after a while. And instead of hearing 12 separate tracks, it sounds like one long, drawn out song--sometimes creating overkill. However the album has a few stand out numbers that make the record more enjoyable. My favorites are--1. Jump2. Get Together3. Sorry4. Forbidden Love5. Let it Will BeIt's definitely unlike anything out in stores today, but the album tends to deliver too much of a good thing--which makes it a little unbearable at times. Nevertheless, it's still worth a listen. 3 1/2 stars!"
3,nothing special about the special edition,"Dont get me wrong, i love COADF, its my second favorite Madonna album (next to Ray of light). But this special edition...well lets just say i expected more. I mean, the 40 page booklet of the complete confessions photoshoot is awesome and the new track ""Fighting Spirit"" is very good to but thats basically it. it also comes with a blank book for drawing (i guess). I just expected more like different versions of some songs or something to that extent. I reccomend you buy this Special edition it wouldnt hurt. Just dont expect anything very spectacular.Fighting Spirit- is a great song. however, Madonna could have done something better with the chorus part. but still its a great song. and is the main reason why i got this. it has a great message and will have you dancing."
5,Buy It 'Cause It Is Going To Make Your Driving Groovy,"I've been having such a capital time driving through my city and blasting this CD out at the same time. Man, Madonna rocks seriously!!!!"
4,Madonna is still a queen!,"""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" is a great album and you can't go wrong with this purchase. ""Hung Up"" is a great song and a great way to kick off this non-stop collection of future pop. All the songs were well produced, excellent samples, and technology usage. It is by far one of her best albums to date. I think that it is a few notches below ""Ray of Light"" and ""Music."" I just wished that she'd focused more on providing some depth to the lyrics. She has been successful in the past with providing great lyrics along with some addictive beats. This album is pretty light in that territory and ""I Love New York"" is just terrible. She should have used it on her ""American Life"" and it would have been in good company with the rest of the cheesy songs. So please skip that song and enjoy the rest of a very good dance album."
5,Best Album since ray of light!!!!!,"I love this album! It has great sounds and is beautifully written. Most people may not like I Love New York, but it is Madonna paying homage to the place that made her a star. Jump right now is my favorite, but the more I listen the more I love all of them. You won't be wasting your money here. Buy it and dance :)"
2,madonna,"This album has all dance songs. No Ballads. This album reminds me of the 80's. When we were all in track suits and leotards and leg warmers. My favorite track on here is Push. I also I hate: Hung Up, Isaac, How High, I love New York, Like It Or Not,Future Lovers and all the other songs."
4,"I like the song ""Hung Up"" Very cool. Don't know about the rest of the album ...","Madonna Loses Belgian Plagiarism CaseNovember 18, 2005, 3:55 PM ETA little-known Belgian songwriter won a plagiarism case against today (Nov. 18), leading a local court to ban the megastar's song ""Frozen"" from sale or broadcast in the country.Songwriter Salvatore Acquaviva's suit had alleged that Madonna's 1998 hit from the album ""Ray of Light"" plagiarized parts of his song, ""Ma Vie Fout L'camp (My Life's Getting Nowhere),"" which had been written five years earlier.""The judge has ruled Madonna must withdraw from sales all remaining discs, and orders that TV and radio can no longer play 'Frozen,'"" Acquaviva's lawyer, Victor-Vincent Dehin, said. No damages were set.Madonna can appeal the ruling. A call to the singer's New York-based publicist was not immediately returned."
2,Is the Disco closed yet?,"I like many gay men love dance music. However, I found Madonna's latest to be utterly boring. To sum it up, it reminds me of being at a bad after hours bar and they just keep playing the same monotonous songs over and over again, before you know it it's 5am and you have a pounding headache and you just want to go home. Madonna's become a brand, and a boring one at that. The first single ""Hung Up"" was atrocious. What a waste of an Abba sample. My biggest complaint is that Madonna's lost her spunk, and it's evident on this entire album. She sounds like she's going through the motions, there is no fun left in her vocals (well there isn't much to her vocals to begin with). Where's fun Madonna? I think she got lost somewhere between Kabalah and English Roses. Madonna hasn't made a good album since RAY OF LIGHT and it's becoming painfully obvious."
1,remember when madonna was innovative?,"Well, this isn't it. Every track is one uninspired basic house beat after the next. Boring doesn't even begin to describe it. I'm all for reinvention, but this is reissue. Don't waste your time."
2,I expected better.,"Disappointing. Coming from Madonna, I truly expected much more. The dance tracks are generic-sounding. If you're in a club, surrounded by sweaty half-naked people, and partially stoned, the music is fluffy and can/will make you feel good. Sitting at home listening to the CD, you can't help but ask yourself, ""What the heck went wrong?"" Only two songs stand out: Jump and Push."
2,TIRED and ENDLESS....,"I don't care how big of a Madonna fan any of us can be, this CD is just annoying. Did she phone in the vocals?My partner is however stuck on this CD like Linus to his blanket. He LOVES it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Madonna basher. I just don't like this CD. For all it claims to be, ""Confessions"" is neither catchy or groundbreaking. The lyrics to most of the songs are brainless and repetitive. C'mon, ""Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone...."" The arrangements are a techno nightmare relying mostly on samples of other songs. Like we need to feed ABBA anymore royalties.Better to buy Madonna's early stuff. Now there's an idea... How about making an album sampling her old music and then ""techno"" it all up. She wouldn't even have to show up to the recording studio."
3,Confessions Is Nothing Too Interesting...,"I was a fan of Madonna in her early years, and even in the 90s she wasn't all that bad. Yet her newest works, including Confessions, just leaves a whole lot to be desired. Her songs are just empty with the same old cliche lyrics that now at her age just make her sound immature. A woman her age I think should have a lot more intelligent things to be saying that's all. Also a lot of her songs just are uninteresting to the point of boring these days.Nonetheless, the album overall is not horrible. There are some songs that prove likeable such as Hung Up, Sorry, Push and especially Forbidden Love- which is a very beautiful song. Other than these mentioned songs though the rest of the album is nothing worth buying. Her older stuff is much better, but old Madonna fans may want to at least try this one out just for the sake of being a fan for so long. For sure there will be a song or two that will catch your ear, but that's about it to me.3/5"
3,Frustrating flawed Madge,"There's so much good in this album. It's almost apoligetic for her dreadful self-centered ""American Life"". Lots of good beats and hooks lay throught the CD. Unfortunetely, Confessions crashes into a mess in the final three tracks. Issac is more of her efforts to publicize Kaballah. Push is just a generally weak cut. Like It Or Not is just more forgettable music. Yes, she gets self centered and hypocrytical on I Love New York (""Paris and London you can keep""? Uh, didn't she move from NYC to London?) but at least you can take it as a love letter to the NYC dance seen. Future Lovers could almost be a sequal to Ray Of Light, while Jump could easily be another single. If one can overlook the problems of Confessions, you can enjoy this album."
4,Great Dance Cd from Madonna,"When first purchasing this cd, I was a little skeptical, but after the first listen, I was hooked! Great driving music, and although there may not be a lot of substance to this cd, it is a great listen, and well worth the purchase. Goes back to ""old"" Madonna, without all of the kaballah/spiritual crap...just great music, that you can listen to on your car on the way to work....mindless fun!"
3,shut up and raise your kids already,"Just kidding. Madonna started out as cutting edge dance/disco, and this is where she has tried to make her come back, of sorts. Her best work lately has been dance music, invigorated or even redefined by outstanding producers, that seem to rewrite her songs in the process.This is a collection of catchy but trite dance grooves that borrow and steal from early 80s/Giorgio Moroder era disco. Unfortunately this was around the time when she was last relevant, and this disc will not change that. It is a little onanistic to steal from a musical style that was the origin of her own career 20 years ago. Here, she revives early 80s disco, which Kylie Minogue and Madonna herself circa Ray of Light/Music, have already done better."
1,she is finally washed up,"This album is probaly the worst Madonna album in over 10 years. What a shame American Life was such a flop....this album is the result of nobody buying that great album! The only catchy song is the one with the Abba sample. Everything else seems like a desperate attempt to get another hit. I don't see the Cure or Robert Smith with any writing credits, but she completely stole the melody and title from the song ""Just One Kiss"". I hope the Cure's lawyers hear this album!"
1,Boring and LOUD--,"The best songs on the album in this order are Hung Up, Forbidden Love, How High, and Isaac. This is not an album I'll keep as I just won't listen to it enough.I watched the MTV Europe awards and basically cried after her performance because it was SO GREAT. I couldn't wait for the album and now I'm just terribly disappointed.She's lost the plot and I can't even begin to think what her next move will be. It looks like Carrie Underwood may just knock her off the #1 spot too and that is SO SAD."
1,so-so c.d,"The best songs in my opinion are Get Together (because it sounds like vintage Madonna), Future Lovers (the most futuristic song on the album that owes a lot to Donna Summer's I Feel Love), Forbidden Love (yes, it is true Kylie took a lot of ideas from Madonna and on this song Madonna does a reverse), and Sorry (a great bass line from the 70s Jackson). The other songs sound like filters. I do not regret buying this cd...I enjoy it. But while I still listen to Madonna's earlier materials (except for AI)...this album will find its way to my basement in the near future."
4,Make me feel like a dork.,"Madonna's latest (at the time I'm writing this) is a dance music album, as if you couldn't guess that from the album title. It's a solid album, with good beats and catchy melodies. Madonna's voice is in fine shape, too. One aspect of the album that I found slightly annoying is that there are no breaks between songs. One song leads right into another. So, if you just want to play one song, it won't have a ""natural"" beginning or ending, if that makes sense. If it doesn't make sense, just click ""not helpful"". Anyway, that's just a minor complaint. Overall, it's very good album that Madonna's fans should enjoy. As an aside, I saw Madonna in concert the other day, performing the songs from this album, and I must say she puts on quite a show."
5,Smash On a Dance Floor,"I threw my birthday party a few days ago. I played several tracks from this CD and people loved them all. Play this CD at your party, for your morning shake or during your housework whatever. You'll love it!"
4,Madonna- Confessions delivers!,"I truly love the new Madonna collection of songs. Growing up in the 80's with Madonna, Confessions takes me back to musical dance rythyms and tunes that I love listening to.I wish ""they"" would release Get Ready To Jump for radio release as this song by far would be perfect for airplay. I love this album. It makes me move. Madonna sounds crystal clear and beautiful as I think she always does.DouglasAtlanta, Georgia USA"
1,Terrible!,"This album is pure trash. Madonna is a sell out, plain and simple. Her last album talking bad about policts flopped, so now she is just working with hot producers and making dance music because it is popular, she just wants money. She is a sell out. She can hardly even sing, and she is unoriginal. Most of these dongs aren't even danceable, Madonna you are almost 50, quit acting young and making this crap, it is not even good or enjoyably, SELL OUT!"
2,Lacking - this CD only has 1-2 good songs,This CD does not live up to its hype! Only 1-2 good songs.
5,Madonna's back!!!,"Hailed as her ""comeback"" from the poorly received ""American Life"" cd Madonna returns to her roots with the finest dance record in years. Future singles from the album are sure to be ""Sorry"" and ""Jump"" but the album as a whole is an awesome party record. You can put it on and go. Even if you were disappointed in her last few albums give this one a chance. You will be suprised at how once again she as re-invented herself!!!"
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun..... One of Madonna's Best","I have been listening to this album for the better part of a week now. It is simply fantastic!Yes.... I have been a Madonna fan since the early 80's - but, I too have had my share of dissapointements - mainly American Life and Bedtime Stories. But THIS ALBUM is one of the best, if not the best Madonna has ever done. As for ""listenability"" from beginning to end, for me it is only comparable to Ray of Light.Madonna is back to the basic ""grove"" with this one. I challenge anyone (who is objective anyway) to sit a spell with this and keep from moving!My personal favorite tracks are Hung Up, Jump, How High and Let it Will Be.In today's overly ""hip-hop"" environment, this is a sinfully sweet confection that I will be enjoying for quite some time to come."
2,stinky pile of poo,"i'm a madonna fan and really enjoyed her last album. there's nothing on this one to compare to ""love profusion"" off of american life. it's all shallow disco with a 16/16 beat. the music is uninspired, dull, and repetitive. at least the producers decided to lose the annoying pitch-shifter they have been using on vocals since cher's album ""believe"". it's time to hang your pumps and ho outfit up, madonna, cause you jumped the shark with this album for me."
1,Gimme Gimme Gimme A Frigging Break!!!,"Madonna is so lame now that she is stealing riffs from ABBA. The song ""Hung Up"" is so horrible that her husband stormed out of the room when he heard it. And she isn't even talented enough to make the cast of Mama Mia let alone ABBA."
2,I prefer old school Madge.,"Sorry, Hung Up and Jump are the only songs I really enjoyed on this album. I found myself skipping many of the other tracks, I just wasn't very impressed by it as I am with her other CD's. Although I wouldn't say it's full of filler tracks which it's not Madge puts passion into each song but I just don't find them appealing.I'm really at a loss if I would recommend it or not, I would recommend 3 or 4 tracks but not the CD as a total. I would recommend some of her older CD's if you want to hear Madge at her best. If you decide not to buy the album I would definitely suggest you buy those 3 tracks I mentioned."
1,Just another clone album,What are these reveiwers on? Madonna is outdated and boring now. Its the Crazy Frog and similar outfits like Banana-rama that are selling the records now. Avoid!
5,What a treat!,"Listening to this Madonna's effort is like eating non-fat candy all day. Sweet, harmless and pleasurable!!!!"
2,More Post Modern Tedium from the Material Girl,"Hey there everyone, listen - that scraping sound you hear is the sound of a last gasp attempt at ploughing the depths of pseudo-nostalgia to make a quick buck. Or could the sound actually be Madonna's whiney voice, still faking emotional torment and pain after all these years rather than expressing any real feelings of her own? Rather than being controversial as many have misjudged, Madonna is actually the epitome of tedious entertainment. This new album is a milky confection, a hodge-podge of recycled cliches and techno bleeps. If the truth be told, Madonna is more akin to a centre-right political party than a serious pop artiste - offend no one, and just tentatively go with the flow to ensure your survival in changing, challenging times."
1,Disco Grandma,"If you don't need lyrics that matter, if you're not listening for original melodies, if you like a beat that toddlers can dance to, this album is for you. Thank goodness I sampled the songs on AOL first and saved myself much grief. All I can say is, ""Madonna, what a mess!"""
5,Great album!,"This is an all-around great album, the whole thing just keeps the music coming, I really enjoy listening to this album a lot! It's very, very good!"
5,Wow,Confessions from madonna is a great great album and one of the year's best. I find it very satiating. Gargantuanly recommended!!!
2,Nice Try!,"If you are into madonna then you might like this album. It has it's moments... If you like dance music this album get's boring at about the middle of the second song. However, if you are looking for a good dance album go out and get Gwen Stefani's ""Love Angel Music Baby."""
1,Madonna sinks to new lows,"the album has failed to capture what it's been publicised for, it's not at all that dancy, the music is sampled from all over the place, and i can honastly say that the only good song on it is Isaac, even though i am against her bringing her beliefs into her work, so all in all, if u didn't buy the album yet, don't, it ain't worth it, the queen of dance and pop has finally lost her rythm.. i wish i can give this album a lower rating, but amazon's lowest rating is only 1 star, and even that madonna doesn't deserve"
2,Sin,Te return of Madonna is bad. I like Hung Up but i have spent 18 for only one song (Hung Up) the others songs are too dance and every Dj around th wrold can do it an maybe better than this cd.Sorry
3,Great production...lacking lyrics.,"This CD is good. No mistake about it. Still it is far from great or even in the top 20 of the year, perhaps the top 100. The production is great which is perhaps the albums most redeaming quality but the lyrics aren't memorable and not very thoughtful/meaningful as those from the Ray of Light album for example. I'd say I enjoyed perhaps half of the 12 songs, the other 6 you can skip, especially her, ""I love NY"" which is perhaps lamest song of the CD."
5,Wow!! Madonna's best disc ever!!!,Madonna does it again...She gets better with the years.Can't wait for the tour next summer...A+
3,I Confess - It's Bland,"""Hung Up"" is the best track on the album. It kicks things off perfectly and is bound to be added to her ever growing cataloge of classics. Continuing on, things run at a steady pace if not reaching the heights of ""Hung Up"". But from ""Forbidden Love"" on the album looses its sparkle. Where is the personality that grabbed us into such hits as ""Burning Up"" and ""Frozen""? Where is the unabashed enjoyment of dance we heard on ""Holiday"" and ""Music""?Confessions might get you moving, but you will quicly tire of the slow, restrained beats and inane or obtuse lyrics that run rampant like a virus on the second half of the album. Even worse, precious few tracks will stay in your mind past the dance floor. Remember when Madonna's music was infectionus? I was expecting joyful dance music on this album.At best, this is a mixed bag. A sad let-down from the former queen of the dance floor."
3,"Was expecting more, but still a strong effort.","When I heard Hung Up, I immediately fell in love with this album and contemplated getting it. I decided to use the First Listen on AOL to make up my mind on this album, and it did.The best song on this album has to be Hung Up by far. The song gives a past feel to it, but also pushes the genre in the future. I thought this track would top the top 10, but it has not done so far.As far as the other songs go, they could have been better. Some of the lyrics did not make sense, but most dance songs usually do.Stand out tracks on this album include Get Together, Isaac, Let it Will Be, Hung Up, Jump, and Push.This album is recomended to true fans. For dance lovers, buy this album as well. For people who do not know if they will like this, I recomend looking at AOL or MTV.com for listening sessions."
2,Only ABBA should do ABBA ---save your money on this one,"When I first heard Madonna's single on the radio, I thought what is Abba getting back together? Did I miss something? HAHA. After I found out that it was Madonna's new single I just rolled my eyes.With that said, I love Madonna and have all of her cds, but this one? Not on my favorite list. Her Dick Tracy sound track is amazing, Rain, Material Girl, Cherish, are all such wonderful songs. But when 47 year olds start singing clubbing songs it makes me laugh....its like my 73yr old gramma hitting the club scene.There is nothing orginal about taking someone else's work and putting your own lyrics to it. I hoped that this cd would be better but it just isn't.I like the older songs so much better then this cd. Save yourself the money and just download it if you want to listen to it. I wish I did!"
2,Really Overrated,"I respect that Madonna had a lot of success and maybe one of the biggest ever, but the last LP, Confessions on a Dance Floor, has been overrated a lot, everyone says this is the best album of Madonna, but not even the half of the success of her first albums achieved."
5,Not bad!,"This album isn't bad at all! It's full of great dance songs, and I think Madonna and Stuart Price work EXTREMELY well together! Look out for other great Madonna albums:-Madonna (1983)-Like A Virgin (1984)-True Blue (1986)-You Can Dance (1987)-Like A Prayer (1989)-I'm Breathless (1990)-The Immaculate Collection (1990)-Erotica (1992)-Bedtime Stories (1994)-Something To Remember (1995)-Evita (1996)-Ray Of Light (1998)-Music (2000)-GHV2 (2001)-American Life (2003)-Remixed And Revisited (2003)Have fun listening to this album!!"
5,Really Great Album,"This is a great Madonna album. So many songs are fantastic. Favorite songs are: Hung Up, Get Together, Let It Will Be, Forbidden Love, Jump, Isaac, Push and Like it or Not (9 out of 12!) But in reality, I think all the songs are good.I don't think it gets enough credit.She is the QUEEN!!!"
5,confessions on a dance floor,"Madonna goes on a whole other direction with ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"". Her sound is the same, only this time with awesome backbeats! ""Hung Up"" combined with Abba's music to ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" is a cool song and the Abba music suits the song 110% I agree with one review; the song ""I Love New York"" she says 'if youu don't like my attitude then you can f off'. I mean, say the whole word! In the same song she says 'pussys' with no problem. WTF? Anyways this is a fantastic cd and it is meant to be played FULL BLAST!!!"
5,MARIAH IS NOTHING compared to MADONNA,"This is absolutely the best Madonna album. It is her quintessential piece of artwork. While Mariah is around flapping her fat behind on MTV, Madonna continues to actually have a brain. Madonna's work is deeper and more inspiring than even. No one can compare."
5,WARNING: Highly Addictive!!!,"Don't listen to this cd if you don't wanna get addicted to it for months.Just when you think you've had enough of it, you'll crave for it again in no time."
4,Great album !,"Hi: It's so nice to hear our lady singing back over real danceable tunes, not over futuristic spiritual syncs. Best cuts in my opinion are ""Get Together"" and ""Jump"" ( can't hardly wait for mixes of those songs). Price's work is awesome. I was a young Madonna fan in the late 80's and I like the way she has evolved, though I'd love to see her teaming up again with Patrick Leonard ( her best work ever), Stephen Bray and perhaps Shep Pettibone. Things has change since those days, so we have, so she has. Great work...Wonderful artwork and cover ( I hated the Erotica and the American Life covers )."
3,Shake to What Madonna Gave Ya',"This is all joints & jams - no ballads or grooves. There are 2 Eastern-influenced songs - ""Isaac"" (featuring Yitzhak Sinwani) and ""Push"", a la of her ""Ray of Light"" album - and 2 songs produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The line about ""U can 'F' off"" (using the letter 'F', not the word) in ""I Love New York"" is corny, but all-in-all a good album. Booklet does not include lyrics."
5,dance music at it's best,dance music from madonna is a nice fresh change from the r&b/hip hop dominating american charts. Get this CD and a copy of american life if you already haven't today. Confessions delivers the dance jams and american life delivers the guitar ballads
5,Thank god she's back!!,"This album is beyond all expectations!! Easily her best album since Ray of Light, Madonna takes her 20 years of evolution and projects it 20 years into the future. Every single track is so heavily layered with samples and beats it will make your head spin! It's hard to pick a fave, but I'm sticking with ""Sorry"" at the moment. This CD is a must have!!"
4,"Great album, she's back!!","First off, Mariah and Madonna do two different types of music. It is stupid to compare them. Why can't we buy both cd's? They are both great in their own particular genre. My favorite song it probably Isaac. Everyone else thought it was weird, but it gets stuck in your head. This album is much better than American Life. I think the album flows well together. I can see all these songs being played in the club if not for the beats alone. I'm a member of Team L.A.M.B. but I can support other artist as well. When you back yourself into a corner, your mind will never expand."
4,A Welcome Return to Form or a Competent Comeback,"Yes she has done it again, Madonna has pulled something good out of the bag and re-established herself after the rubbish that was American Life. This CD is full of great dance tracks and Madonna has reclaimed her throne even if for once she isn't leading the charge but just being part of the pack. It is a competent comeback and nothing more as there is nothing new or remotely original here. Hung Up would be lost without the ABBA backing and Sorry (track 3) is just Hung Up without the ABBA backing and to rhyme New York with dork is really scratching the bottom of the barrel. A must buy for the fans and anyone that just loves loves loves 'Hung Up'. Unfortunately for Ms Ciccone this won't win many new converts."
3,Nothing tops Ray Of Light.....,"Yes, this CD is catchy, but there's also something about it that isn't that catchy enough to listen to it after 2 months after it's release date. Ray of Light is still my fav, but this is another good Madonna CD to add to your collection. (Plus her remixes are the best and she always releases all of them - unlike other artists.)Best tracks:Hung UpGet TogetherFuture LoversI Love New York"
1,This dumbkuff forgot disco died in 1979,"I can't believe how many people are taken in by this phony known as Madonna, Madonut to me. Are there that many blind sheep who thinks this disgrace to Italian Americans is great. Her use of the song Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba on Hung up which should be called Hung Over was sickening. She's proven over and over again that she's a bad singer, actress, writer and king sized HYPOCRITE who hates her fans and only likes their MONEY!!! Confessions on a Dance Floor!!?? Dressed up disco crap for the millenium or shall I say ARMAGEDDON. If any of you pallies want good music, buy Ted Nugent's Double Live Gonzo or Live at Hammersmith!"
3,Confessions on a Dancefloor???,"Don't be fooled by reviews saying this album is a true dance record and that it is the best album Madonna has ever made, it's not the truth! Sadly Madonna just can't seem to leave the electronica style of music behind and it's become exhausting and predictable. While Confessions is a step towards dance it never really gets into the genre completly. The beats are however infectious (hence the 3 star rating) but lyrically and vocally the album falls flat. One of Madonna's greatest gifts is that she always has been able to write some of the most catchy pop tunes of our time (Holiday, Like a Prayer, Lucky Star etc..) but here the songs are totally forgettable. I've listened to the album at least 4 times and other than Hung Up I can't remember any other song. They don't ""stick"". This album will soon find itself out of my cd player and will be laid to rest with the other cds I shouldn't have bought collecting dust."
3,Umm....,"This album is OK. This is her 1st album that didn't instantly grab me. Yes, the production is excellent, but who really cares about that if the songs aren't enjoyable. The 1st 3 songs are hands down the best, then after that it just a blended stew of lameness. And what is with the song ""Push"". Am I the only one that thinks of Mariah Carey or J.LO when I hear it? And ""Jump"", eww, not a good song, it sounds so weak. It's almost a joke. I love Ray Of Light (everyone seems to compare it to that album), which if Ray Of Light was a person, it should be very offended. Oh, and I thought American Life was great, diffently a fav. I don't know what else to say. I've come to the conclusion that, maybe I'm just not gay enough for this CD."
3,"Sorry, but Hung Up again","Although she is still a big artist album wise, Madonna has only released 3 great albums in her career, i.e. True Blue, Like a Prayer & Ray of Light. All the other ones have had great songs but lacked consistency (Like a Virgin did though come close being solid).Having heard Hung Up and reading rave reviews of Confessions, I hoped, as a fan ever since she sang Holiday on TOTP eons of years ago, that finally another solid set was in the works. Sadly, she disappoints again.There are 4 great songs on this album; 3 have already been released as singles and I am sure the 4th one will be as well. The songs are Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry and Forbidden Love. A couple of decent songs are also included but the rest is, regrettably, filler material. These (great) songs salvage the whole set, justifying some love and 3 stars, thus being in whole average but Madonna really should do better."
2,a bit disappointing,"I have been a longtime fan of Madonna, but I was thoroughly disappointed by her latest CD. Of course her hit single ""Hung Up"" is very catchy, but that is only because she sampled an Abba song. Even tracks that have some potential are ruined by her cliched and self-involved lyrics. Get over yourself Madonna, not everyone wants to be you and have your life."
3,Doesn't measure up,"If you're looking for ""The Immaculate Collection,"" you'll be disappointed. There are a few strong songs in this collection, but nothing like the best of Madonna. I watched Madonna's special on televsion during 2006 and got excited about buying ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" (which featured many of the songs she performed on televison), but the video portion of the television broadcast must have significantly enhanced the audio experience because I was under-whlemed when I played the CD."
5,If You Like the Single Hung Up.....,Then why not get CONFESSIONS on a DANCE FLOOR and see what all the rage is about? Madonna has once again reinvented her image and this collection of future hits is as amazing as her early albums in the 80s were and as Ray of Light and other more recent works!Madonna may have grown older and more conservative (thank God) but this album demonstrates that she can still be a mover and shaker!
5,Madonna's Best Album To Date!!!!,"Madonna has topped herself once again with Confessions on a Dance Floor. This album is better than 'Ray Of Light' because the music is much more fun. The album will keep you dancing throughout. The stand out tracks are 'Hung Up', 'Sorry', 'Jump' and 'Get Together'. GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!"
1,Just another dance album,"The whole album sounds like one only song, just like all the ""New music"" I like the ""ABBA"" song and wish i bought the single only, I got bored, isnt an album that i would play in my car till the end, sure will/is a hit on the dancefloor."
2,Too much synthesizer,"The first song ""Hung Up"" is to me the classic Madonna sound that I wanted to hear. This song is a great 80's feel dance song and is definately a five star song. The rest of the CD sounds like the ""Ray of Light"" CD. If you like the synthesizer sound than you will love these songs... if you don't then think twice before purchasing. Once I heard ""Hung Up"" on the radio I assumed the rest of the CD would have the classic sound. Hopefully there will be a Confessions II CD."
1,Awful,"Now I am not a madonna hater, look at my review history, I have given Madonna albums 5 stars!But Madonna's new 2005 release ""Confessions on a dance floor"" has showed that she is not only desperate for attention, but has also ripped off her fans of their money for this awful, boring, and flat album.On november 15th, i ran to my local record store to purchase this album, I thought madonna could do no wrong. But i was horrificly dissapointed when I listening to this tripe. Not only are all the songs montonous and souless, half of them are not even dancey! Songs like Issac, Like it or not, and Let it will be show that she has lost her creative genius.However, the record does have a FEW decent songs, noticeably ""push"" and ""jump"" But both are not worthy of spending $15.00In conclusion, stay away from this awful, boring, and montonous album, get Mariah Carey's ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" instead."
1,Lamb,This dude who claims to both respect Madonna and Mariah is a LAMB. Dont be fooled. And NO Mariah is not the best selling female of all time. Mariah and her propaganda crew inflates her numbers to no end! Celine Dion has sold more then Mariah for crying out loud! Madonna is in the Guiness Book of world records for being the best selling female. If Mariah was you would think they would have changed it. Madonna could have the best selling album to if she released 50 versions of the same album.
4,This Music Speaks for Itself,"While not a milestone collection such as ""Like a Prayer"" or ""Ray of Light"", this fun-filled CD brings dance back to the mainstream. After 23 years, Madonna proves that she still has her finger on the pulse of music despite her ever-changing style.Each & every track makes the listener want to bump, grind or flow to the beat of their disco-esque production. It took several listens of this collection for me to fully appreciate its musical value.I hold Madonna as a lyricist in high esteem. Unfortunately, a handful of these songs lack quality lyrics (""I Love New York"" is painful to listen to). Because of this, I can't give ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" 5 stars. However, the music on this CD speaks for itself."
5,Madonna Re-Invents Again....,"By the time I heard the song Hung Up (Before the release date of CD), I firmly believe that Madonna have more new experiments on her album, Confessions on a Dance Floor. I have the album, and listen to each and every track, believe me - I was not dissapointed. I am very impressed with this album. This twelve track album is a non-stop, all-dance music. After each and every song, a new song immediately comes in without any pause with each track. If you want to experience a disco environment at your home, just put this CD in your sound system. Her songs have a vibe to 70s and 80s concept, and has a modern twist. Hope you won't mind me saying this - I really love the album artworks. I was so impressed how Madonna poses - Her body rocks!!!! No wonder she's in a very good shape at an age of 47. Trust me, this CD won't let you dissapoint. Buy this CD. It is worth to buy. You'll surely dance...."
4,Absolutely Intense!,"This disc jumps right out at you with dizzying, spellbinding and trancelike tracks with infectious hooks. The music never stops between songs, but segues seamlessly into the next song. This is serious pulsating dance music with flawless production that sounds retro and futuristic all at once. I Love New York is a standout track, featuring a heavy churning groove and ripping guitar as it takes you into the chorus. This rock music fan has found this disc to be a pleasant surprise."
2,Not too good.,Great riff from ABBA. But Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! is much better than this fake.I think this is only shadow of Madonna from 80's and 90's.
1,Horrid Album,Madonna's career died w/ Ray of Light..She should definitely RETIRE her brittle bones! and go live in the English Country-Side..
1,I confess: this should be wiped off the face of the earth-yuk yuk triple yuk!!!,"Hi muzak hatersI confess: this should be wiped off the face of the earth-yuk yuk triple yuk. This lame music has been intensely UNinteresting for several decades.Cloathe the Volts, enough is enoughSenders Can"
1,"This is a part two song of ""Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie"" by ABBA...","THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE EMBARRASMENT TO MADONNA AND TO MADONNA FANS WORLDWIDE. What is Madonna thinking? Is she crazy? She's copying over 75% of the music ideas from ""Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie"" by ABBA in the new hit song ""Hung Up."" This is not new music. This is copied and unoriginal. She must made that song in only one hour. ABBA should sue Madonna for this. I CAN'T BELIEVE MADONNA IS THE MOST HIGHLY-RATED ARTIST OF ALL TIME ENDS UP TO BE THE MOST PLAGIARIST ARTIST OF ALL TIME. WHY IS HER RECORD COMPANY ALLOWING PLAGIARIZE MUSIC TO THE PUBLIC? WHAT A DISGRACE."
2,Sounds like one long song,"To be fair I've listened to this CD five times in a row--you know, to see if it's one of those CDs that grow on you. NO! Listening to this is like being trapped in an elevator with MUZAK playing continuously. Hung up and sorry are passable. Your high and Push are just shy of potential-and that's it. What happened to my 80's icon? What's with the Jane Fonda 1982 workout outfits? It's not doing anything for me. While she still has the moves and the body, I'm just not feeling this one. The extra star is just because she's Madonna."
1,What Was She Thinking???,"I have to say, I looked forward to this album, and it is one of the worst of Madonna's long career. I grew up listening to her music, and must admit that the lyrics and musical scores are very immature for someone who has been around as long as she has. I would expect this from a novice singer, but never from an artist in the leagues of Madonna.Her best album to date has been ""Ray Of Light"". She's had two very mediocre albums in between, but to have an album holding a magnitude of higher expectations fall as flat as this one is extremely disappointing.Save your money and spend it elswhere on music that really is chart worthy."
1,THIS is what the wait was for? Yuck!,"I remember the day when Madonna was a trendsetter. Now she seems to be the follower, but getting a bit lost. With the exceptions of ""Jump"" and ""Future Lovers"", this CD is a total waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid Madonna fan. I just feel she sold out here for a quick buck (since her movie career is nothing). It would have been nice to have had a ""dancefloor"" CD that contained songs to which you could actually dance. ""You Can Dance"" was a remix CD, but at least it showed some variety and originality. On this endeavour, Madonna sounds like Kylie Minogue...only less focused and singing off-key (as usual)."
1,IS MADONNA THE NEW EMPEROR?,"Do not waste your $$ on this album. All the songs sound the same! Madonna has taken dance beats from the past and just added a few elementary rhymes (i.e., New York, dork)! I expect something a little deeper from a 46 year old established singer and former superb songwriter. But like sheep to the slaughter, a lot of people are buying this cd just because it's Madonna. Oh well."
1,Where is my review?,"Who did my review disappear from the Amazon site?I've been a customer of Amazon for years, now I ask, why I should think like the majority of mediocre people? Why should I like this outrageous Madonna? Only because people want I to like? I want my review back. Where is the liberty of expression?Maybe Amazon did this because of Madonna's pressure, who knows?I only said things that I really believe, is my opinion, I'm a free man.Maybe Amazon only wants reviews saying good things about the goods in question in order of increasing sales. This is ridiculous!"
1,Hmmm why would anyone bother,"Everything on this Cd sounds exactly the same and Madonna goes half (...) with her vocals as usual. The lyrics are a pile of crap too... I mean ""I Love New York"".... wow good for you... we don't care!"
5,"Madonna's best album since ""Ray of Light""","This is definitely Madonna's best album since ""Ray of Light"". From track 1 to the end, it's a great dance anthem album. I was in a club and they played the album from start to finish the weekend before it hit the street! Everyone was out on the dancefloor!Standout tracks are: ""Get Together"", ""Hung Up"", ""Push It"", and ""Like It or Not""."
4,Madonna got her groove,"The is easily one of the best Madonna CDs, I have heard for a long time... ever since Ray of Light and Music. Dance music has always been a large part of her talent, and it clearly shows here. Madonna produced most (if not all othe songs). Only a handful of them are written by her, but they are terrific. ""Jump"" is my favorite, but I dig ""I Love New York"". Yeah, ""Hung Up"" is addictive, but really all of the songs are done so well. This CD is a real jolt to a career that is almost as old as I am. She has been around for so long, you forget the knack she has for just letting you listen...and dance."
4,Kickazz,"First CD I have purchased in a long time with no regrets.Every song is memorable, the lyrics are empowering without being preachy. Hypnotic beats keep you locked into Madonna's world and literally make you feel like you're in a highrise dance club. My mind takes a trip everytime I play the CD, which is nice when you're sitting at your desk for 8 hours a day.The only thing that kept me from giving the album 5 stars is that song #5 ""I love New York"", was subpar for me...in fact, Id go so far to say it's 'stupid' compared to the rest of the album. It's the only song that seems silly and has nothing to offer me. But, cut that song out, and the album is absolutely snap. Finally Madonna gets fun again and does what she does best: make you want to get up and dance :)"
4,Dance Music with a Purpose,"Has a Donna Summer meets Ray of Light quality to it. It has move your butt music with meditative interludes and is guaranteed to make at least one part of your body move. No lyrics in cover, a few pics of Madonna and credits is all."
5,"SHES DOING FINE AGAIN, GREAT DISCO - POPTRONICA ALBUM !","MADONNA RETURNS TO THE DANCE FLOOR WITH A VERY FINE ALBUM, IT MAKES ME REMEMBER MADONNA IN THE EIGHTIES BUT WITH A 2005 POPTRONICA FLAVOR, IF YOU LIKE TO DANCE YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN OF POP !"
5,Smoking!!!,Madonna is the goddess of artist reingineering...once again she has transformed herself and the music to let us know she is the queen of pop no matter her age. I have followed Madonna since her first album in 1983 (I was 12 at the time)and she has impressed me the easy way she can change her style of music without losing that Midas touch. I've always tought that Michael Jackson was great at that before running into trouble in the late 90s.Love her music and hope to hear her for at least another 30 years.
5,One of the best albums of 2005.,"This album is brilliant - even better than Ray of Light!! The best music Madonna has released for a long time and I think the best Album of 2005.This is the first album that is really euphoric and uplifting all the way through that Madonna has ever done. No Messages, politics, complaining etc etc. It makes you want to dance and feel good.Sorry is a genius pop song, Future Lovers is going to sound amazing on a sound system in a club as is I Love New York, Jump and How High. Let Will Be and Like It or Note are very clever well written songs.Can't wait for the remixes and the hopefully a new tour - should be an all out disco tour!"
5,"Best of 2005: Madonna's best since ""Ray of Light""","""Confessions On a Dance Floor"" opens up a new period for Madonna's music, one where she's going back to before she started making music, blending in a disco-like sound with bits and pieces from her ""Ray of Light"" period. With multiple producers lined up at her side and this being her sixth no. 1 album, it took over the dance and pop charts by storm soon after its release, ruling in a way only she can get us used to.The album opens with ""Hung Up"", an ABBA-tribute song leading into one song after another of solid performances, with ""Let It Will Be"" and ""Jump"" serving as two solid album anchors. Though the last two tracks loose a bit of power, the album as a whole is a very impressive production that reconfirms Madonna as the undisputed Queen of Pop and shows her at the top of her musical condition. Without a doubt, one of the best albums of 2005."
5,*Bows down to Madonna*,You did it again girl! I have loved you ever since I was 7 (I am 18 now) and you have been an inspiration to chicks like me. Me and my friends love driving around blasting this CD! Your best since Ray of Light! I LOVE YOU! (you think M reads these? lol) Long Live The Queen!
4,"Better than ""American Life...""","A much better album than ""American Life"" although I felt it wasn't as dancefloor friendly as has been hyped - it's a bit plodding in places. ""Hung Up"" and ""Push"" are great though. ""Push"" is old school Madonna, brilliantly sung with great lyrics. ""Forbidden love"" is another fave.As a Madonna fan since 1983 I have followed her throughout the years, only stumbling when ""AL"" came out in 2003. I found both the politics (which really isn't her thing) and the ""poor me, I wish people understood me"" ranting a bit too hard to swallow, particularly coming from a multi-millionaire with no real everyday problems.Whats really missing from this album is one or two more disco house/trance type stomping dancefloor fillers other than ""Hung up"". I did think it would be a bit faster - if this was played at a proper club, it would have to be speeded up a bit. Still, it's a much appreciated return to form. Let's hope Madge sticks with this type of thing, it does suit her so well.Regards."
5,Her best ever!!!!,"I confess I did not get the special edition, but nonetheless, I purchased the album anyway. I listened to 6 times in the past two days, and let me tell you, a great studio album since ""Ray Of Light"" in 1998, It has been a while since I bought a studio album of Madonna's . But with every song you pretty much have to listen to with your eyes closed, the beats are amazing!!! The first three songs pulls you in and, ""Get Together"" is playing in my head as I am writing this, this shows you how much this album is affecting me. Aside from the first three, the rest is awesome, like ""Forbidden love"", ""Issac"", ""Push"", ""How High"",""Jump"" and other songs that will pretty much have you dancing, but not in the car, that could be dangerous. Either way, you'll love it if you are a Madonna fan, or a dance fan."
5,Class.,"Brilliant Limited Edition. That's all I've got to say. The CD is by far one of the most awaited and anticipated albums of the year, I love it!The bonus track Fighting Star is great.The two colour books are fabulous.Need I say more?"
5,dance music rocks,"this year charts were bombarded with r&b/hip hop and non talented singers trying to be rock chicks. Madonna on the other hand took a different musical direction and came out with a dance driven electronica album that appears to be a breath of fresh air in the music scene for getting out of the underground again. Madonna never fails to use the element of surprise to get the attention of music fans, and benefits greatly from it. Expect Madonna to be having hits from now till late 2006/early 2007. I guarantee you she will win a grammy or two for this dance music masterpiece."
4,The Ultimate,"Madonna and she's super Star! I been a great fan of Madonna but lately missed out listening to her but suddenly she's back with a bang especially with her ultimate number 'Sorry' - It's got a perfect beat, continuous flow and rythm and her voice so soothing n fresh as ever. You'll want to hear this song again and again endlessly! Tina Turner at the age of 50 plus had entertained the audience but Madonna - she's super reigning and age don't seem to touch anywhere. Back to her roots, I Love New York and Forbidden Love are two numbers that I like very much too. Forbidden Love is a slow dance track that would make you sway with joy sealing destiny forever. A Pop n trance - thats Madonna and she sure sells!"
4,You need to listen with the volume turned way up,"You have to listen to the CD a few times to get a feel for it. After that, you are hooked and you'll love the beat of the music and the techno feel of the music. I wish Madonna would have left the song ""Isaac"" off the CD. That is the only bad song on the CD, so I had to give her 4 stars. Otherwise, she would have had the 5. It's great to hear music that sounds different from all the other junk out there. Kudos to Madonna!"
1,You're not in your twenties anymore,"Why does Madonna refuse to acknowledge that she is a middle-aged mother who looks ridiculous trying to look and act like she is 20 years old. I've never been much of a Madonna fan, and the few tracks I've heard on this album only reinforce my opinion of her music. I admit that at one time she was an innovative force in the music/entertainment industry, even with VERY limited vocal talent, but c'mon now.. isn't time to pack it up already? It goes to show that it doesn't take much to be $ucce$$ful in today's mainstream market."
1,"Love Madonna, but not this album",When i listened to this album i found it to be quite dull. NO sparks or anything. She proved she cant sing like she used to. Ill go back to listening to Ray of Light because this is not a good album
2,Ik ben droevig...,"She sings in the beginning of ""Sorry"", as the phrase ""I am sorry"" in a great number of other languages.She probably used Babelfish, because if you translate ""I am sorry"" into Dutch you get ""Ik ben droevig"". But unfortunately, ""Ik ben droevig"" has quite another meaning in Dutch, it means ""I am sad"". Let's call it a research mistake.The album itself makes me kind of sad too. This has nothing to do with disco music, this is simple DJ music (samples all over the place). Yes it's popular music, so it will sell well. But this album will be forgotten in a few years from now.Except maybe for some legal cases popping up every now and then."
2,You've got to be kidding??,"This is not ""old"" Madonna. Although Hung Up is good, the rest is ALL filler. I'm so disappointed it makes me sick. How can anybody think this is a good buy? The words are pathetic and the sounds as if it took 15 minutes to write. Too much ""talking"" in the songs which make it sound cheesy. And to be honest, it's not even a good dance CD. You keep wishing the next song will be stronger, but they are all weak after Hung Up and even though I like that one, it's not like it's Vogue or one of the many Madonna classics. You are Madonna, what's up with the synthesized Britney voice?? Oh well, bye bye $9.99, hope you enjoy the money Madge."
2,"Great Producer, Bad performance.","Again after his fabriclive Jacques Lu Cont (Thin White Duke) shows us what quality of sound is meant to be. The 21 year old genious, an english man despite the name, produced this dj like album without loosing its popish nature. Madonnas first target for this album would be the middle age gay community, maybe this is why the first single includes an abba sample which i think ruins the whole Lu Cont intention. The sound of the album itself is outstanding but the album lacks a meaning. I mean if you are giving us ""confessions"" try the new york lyrics. Very deep. If the intention was to make people jump off their seats, I think ""Hung up"" will do the job, indeed I think this single will be overplayed in every single club around the globe. So with a little time it might become too much."
1,Horrible! This is music?,"I was expecting good things from this album. Even though the current single ""Hung Up"" isnt anything groundbreaking, I thought I would give it a try. I am embarassed to say I bought this CD. There is nothing on here that sounds like a legendary singer. Madonna, this might be the end of the road for you. I am very disappointed in this album."
5,Fabulous Madonna,"It's astonishing for a 47-year-old woman to produce something as fresh as Confessions On A Dance Floor. There's nothing on this record that I can be disappointed with. The album brilliantly starts with Hung Up and defiantly ends with Like It Or Not. From the start onto the end, I find myself lost in a whirlwind of sheer fun. But, the highlight for me is during the tenure of Let It Will Be. It's fierce, it's insightful, it's defiant and it has the most meat. Highly Recommended!!!"
5,Madonna's Back!,"I have to admit after enjoying ""American Life"" I didn't quite know what to expect from ""Confessions on A Dance Floor."" But I gotta tell you that I received is as a Christmas gift in 2005, and I have honestly listened to at least once every day since I first played it. I love 70's disco and especially old Donna Summer and Madonna took that concept and ran with it. Best Dance album ever. Once you hear the stirrings of ""Hung Up,"" which is the first track...you're hooked."
5,An Ode to Joy,"Madonna brings us a masterpiece composed of twelve dancy songs.The level of production done by Stuart Prices is incredible, each song is unique and has it's own flavor.There are songs for every taste, catchy and funny, romantic, upbeat, just about every type of dance music compiled in one cd."
5,Awesome!,"I pre ordered this and got it on Saturday 12th and it aint been outta my CD player since.....WOW what an amazing album the best in years. Opening with Hung Up it is pure dance at its best with amazing tunes such as Sorry,Forbidden Love,and something completely different with Isaac.....Madonna is a musical geniusBuy this CD now!!"
5,Queen of pop is back,"Madonna does it again, always one to never disappoint with a great dance album."
5,dance...Dance...DANCE!!!,"This CD is unbelievalbe! Madonna fans WILL NOT be disappointed! Dance fans will not be disappointed. If you love dance music, then you'll truly enjoy this CD. The music sounds really, REALLY good!!Unfortunately, her lyrics seem to play as the background for the music and her voice on a majority of the songs. SHE IS SAYING SOMETHING (religous undertones?), listen closely even when the music distracts you. :o)I agree with others, this is an instant classic! Buy it and DANCE!! This CD will keep you on your feet!!"
5,Hot Thai Chicks Love Madonna!,"I'm a New Yorker who's been traveling Asia. Right now, I'm enjoying myself in Bangkok, Thailand. Over the past week, I got to spend sometime in some of the city's hottest clubs. Man, people here loved Hung Up and Sorry. Those tiny beauties shook their ass off whenever Madonna blasted out. A few days later, I did what I'd never done before which was buying Confessions on a Dance Floor just to see what the Thai fuss was all about. Now, I see why! God, am I becoming a fan? It'll be fun to hear what my friends have to say about this."
5,GREAT!,"Brilliant album from Madonna, definately her best yet, and I'm not just saying that!Lovin' Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry, Forbidden Love, Jump and Isaac!"
3,Madonna Singing Trance?,"Madonna singing trance??? Well... I don't know. The songs are pretty good. All the songs are very consistant with the same beat. However, the songs get old pretty fast. I will give the packaging 5 stars. But overall, this CD is average."
3,Christmas Gift.,"This album is OK. I only like 5 songs from it. Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry, I Love New York, and Push. All the rest - gotta go. I got it for a Christmas gift and I'm a person who appreciates everything. Right now this CD is on my shelf, collecting dust. I pick it up every now and then to hear Get Together."
3,Like a media hype,"I believe this album is like one of those movies you hear so much about and see pictures in the cover of magazines and then when you buy the ticket and sit down at the theater right in the middle of the movie you realize this was another marketing plot to sell an average or mediocre product. The album's best cut are 'Hung Up' and 'Isaac', the rest is not so good.From her most recent work, 'Bedtime Stories' is her best 5 star album following 'Ray of Life' and 'Music', this album is not at the same level at all.If you want to hear some good music this year by a pop icon get Sinead O'Connor's new reggae album 'Throw Down your Arms' its brilliant and a more genuine effort than Madonna's hyped work.. and it is on sale here at amazon."
3,"New for Madonna, not new for the rest of us.....","Yeah, so it may seem she has done something new and exciting...for herself, but it's nothing but fabricated music, following the rage of pop stars today.If you go off and listen to some europop, you'll hear where Madonna came up with her album. I mean, she does live over there after all now.The songs are GOOD. They are FUN. But, unlike many of her previous albums, this shows nothing new at all. It's not groundbreaking, and I was rather disappointed.I was eagerly awaiting this album since about August or something, when I heard she was coming up with something knew. I couldn't wait to hear it, and when I did. Well. Meh.Nothing new or anything. But it's still good. It's fun music and it is enjoyable, but it's nothing horribly exciting or new.I'm glad she's come out with something new though. I hope her next album is something amazing.But yes. A must for any Madonna fan, or if you're a collector."
2,Great music -- Lame limited edition!,"The CD is great. The Limited Edition leaves a lot to be desired -- could have included a DVD, full lyrics, etc. instead of the pointless diary. I bought it for the bonus track (which is terrific), but I was not happy with this clunky package. For someone who is so cutting edge in her music, this is another packaging disappointment like the ""American Life"" Limited Edition."
5,Best No-Brainer Album in Years!,"I miss the ""artistic"" Madonna that gave us Ray of Light or Like A Prayer, but this album is burning up my stereo and putting me in a great mood when I need it. The songs are short on lyrics but incredible on production and Madonna's singing is excellent (especially when she uses the lower register of her voice on ""Jump."" The two standout tracks here are ""Jump,"" and ""Sorry."" Who said dance music was dead?"
5,the CD we've been waiting for,"This CD blew me away. This is the CD Madonna has always wanted to make. Ok, so she ""borrowed"" a few things. Who hasn't? It's great from beginning to end. Quite a few of the tracks hold a special meaning for me. She hit a nerve with this one."
5,Number one album in 40 countries.....,"Confessions On A Dancefloor Is the best Madonna album sinceRay Of Light in 1998.Madonna brings the world a very strong collection of greatdance songs,of which she co-wrote and co-produced on each one.The most noteworthy tracks here are Hung Up,Jump,Forbidden Love,Sorry,I Love New York,and Get Together.U.S. radio stations should be very ashamed of themselves forlargely ignoring a Madonna masterpiece!In typical Madonna fashion,the album and singles have set someunprecedented records around the globe...good for Mrs. Ritchie!"
3,"Trite , Weak Lyrics, Sound Mix Cool","It's obvious that Madonna has the money to hire the best sound mix team, but has gotten lazy with her lyric writing - it's trite and simple simple .. ""sticks and stones won't break my bones"" and another example ""I love NY other cities make me feel like a dork?"" !! What!?who knows probalby a marketing ploy to sell to 12 year olds."
5,definitely one of this year's best,"I initially didn't like the album but it grew on me over a few days. Interestingly, no one track stands out as a popular fave. Practically every track has lots of people who like and dislike it.This being my third Madonna album, I thought I'd know what to expect. I'm 15 now and I didn't know much of Madonna before. But I was wrong. This album is just so different and there's something about it all that makes it amazing. The lyrics (other rhan on I Love NYC) and the music blend really well.. it seems so out of this world. I like that it's dancy and all but she sings about things that are meaningful and intelligent like on How High.Definitely worth at least a few listens."
4,Incorrect Info,"The review by Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina"" (should be the first review) is wrong several areas:GET TOGETHER does NOT contain a sample of Stardust's Music Sounds Better With You.FUTURE LOVERS does NOT contain a sample of Donna Summer's I Feel Love. Part of the song is an homage to Giorgio Moroder. No sample involved.LET IT WILL BE does NOT sample Madonna's own Papa Don't Preach. In fact, the two string parts sound nothing alike.PUSH does NOT sample Madonna's own Like a Prayer.I won't even start on the grammatical errors in his review..."
5,Get Into the Groove,"Impossible not to shake your booty after listening ""Hung Up"", ""Sorry"" and ""Jump"".Impossible not to fall in love with ""Get Together"" and ""Forbidden Love"".One of Madonna's best works, with every song as a potential single."
5,"Thanks Madge, for another great album!",Another great album from the Queen!I don't understand why some fans don't like this product!It's absolutely FANTASTIC!
5,"She's BAAAACK better, tighter, and fiercer than ever. Now DANCE!","Madonna has really done it this time. She's managed to give something to the die hard fans that have been with her from the early dayz, as well as those who jumped on the late train in her career. The album explodes with glitter amid disco balls that flash you back and jerk you into future disco with a non-stop stream of dance pop that's finger snapping/toe-tapping good. ""Get Together"", ""Sorry"" ""Let It Will Be"" and ""Jump"" will make you jump out of your seat. This is by far M's best album since Ray of Light. Trussst me darrlinks. You won't be disappointed. But never mind me. Hop to it and find out for yourself."
5,"If you're human, you won't be able to resist this album.","Madonna's new album is something special. The songs are so exuberant and powerful and fun and magnetic that only a robot could resist them. Give yourself over to the frenetic vibe and just have fun! Enjoy it for what it is and if you've spent the last several years bad-mouthing Madonna and everything she does, it's OK to rescind your negativity. We die-hard fans will forgive you and welcome you back into the fold of Madonna fans.I love the message on ""Like It or Not."" Like Madonna or not, you'll be boogeying your butt off to this music for years to come if you just give it a chance. Take that, you haters!"
3,She Can Do Better!!,"I must say i did enjoy this cd. However, Madonna can do soo much better. The lyrics have no meaning and seem to have been written by a 10th grader. The music is great and a welcome change from other popular artists. The tempo is the same throughout, though, so I think I will become easily bored with this cd."
2,not so Hung Up on this album,"this is the first madonna album that i've gotten. i took a chance without even listening to it that madonna had went back to the 80's slightly hip-hoped pop madonna. but its far worse. madonna has gone into the territory of...*gasp*--TECHNO!! if u like techno, thats fine, get this album, but to anyone who thiks this album is gonna be...hmm....good-do not get this album. unless u have the word DJ in front of your have or own a club, save this money for a night at Ruby Tuesday's."
3,?!So So!?,"The new cd by Madonna is one that many older and younger fans can injoy and dance to. Overall the cd was just another cd full of nice and catchy songs, but none more catchy than the enfectous dance hit Hung Up. This song has gotten plenty of radio and video air time and has made a statement that Madonna is here to stay and will continue to make music for the generation she is living in. That is the only song worth listning to on the radio and I feel the album will do well with the already good sucess from the song. She may need to write more like it if she plans on selling more albums though.!"
1,"Mindless, tasteless, insubstantial fluff.","This ""music"" is just uncreative, derivative nonsense. Can Madge sing? No. Write a decent lyric? No. Write music or play an instrument well? No and no. So as usual she pulls in some folk to concoct a musical backdrop for her inane self-congratulatory lyrics. Yeah, lots of people love NY, woo-hoo, but it's not the only cool city in the world. Wanna dance? Go buy some Paul Van Dyk. Hear authentic, talented musicians trying to improve the world? That'd be U2, for starters. Care to hear a great singer? Almost anyone is better. Times up old girl; you may be popular, but so is McDonalds."
5,My first Madonna record,and based on this it wont be my last. I have seen the Hung Up video on TRL and I really liked it so I bought the album a week ago and I have not stopped listening. Best album of the year.
1,This cd is boring...,"Madonna is a star,but this cd, has been very boring and dull,I had to be honest,sorry Madonna's fans. I really wanted to hear something ""disco"" in this cd,but it has not any ""dancing"" song""Hung up"" is the best track.The others are really boring.Madonna has the fama from the past.that's it."
1,Don't Buy This,Don't buy this because all of the songs are the same. The Emancipation of Mimi is a much better buy. These songs sound the same because they are all dance songs. I bought this and The Emancipation of Mimi at the same time. I barely listen to this
1,Not Great..Not Good..Not Bad!,"These Confessions shouldve been kept to herself. Push is horrendous. Hung Up is an example of plagarism at its worse. Isaac is all over the place. The only good thing about this c.d is sorry. btw. Madonna just LOST a plagiarism suit, a very serious one , the courts in Belgium say she STOLE the song Frozen."
3,Madonna's glass is half empty,"I found some lyric creativity,but with the constant sampling of songs that occurs these days,one must wonder when somebody will go out on a limb and develope a rythm or melody on thier own.I expected a little more in that category from the great one,but was dissappointed considering what she has come up with in the passed.definately some good tracks,but i am still waiting for the next ray of light....."
4,The mature Madonna I've been waiting for,"'Confessions' is a very ballsy bassy European mix and makes 'ray of light' sound like a dated electronic joke. ""Forbidden Love"" is her greatest ballad ever. I hope common folks who don't buy this hear it on the airwaves soon. So many great songs to enjoy after getting past the track 1 ABBA single."
4,Music Obsessive,"Madonna, whether you love her or loathe her, is undoubtedly a jaw-dropping cabaret. She can rock a crowd, old and young and churns out nuggets of musical gold. Possibly spurred on by Elton John's slants about her inability to sing, she faded her own voice up whilst singing at the MTV European Music Awards. I have to say it didn't sound the best. Anyone would struggle dancing about like that without getting horribly out of breath and sounding like a wavering 13yr old choir boy with a voice about to break. She should have mimed because genuinely I don't think most people would have cared. She's a total show woman: hard-working and impossibly innovative when re-vamping her image...As a package, Madonna is abbbbbsolutely brilliant. 'Hung Up' is generating some extraordinary bootlegs and I can only imagine how 'Get Together' will sweep the Club National in 2006.Go Madge! Hands in the air people!!"
1,Doesn't Fit,I ordered a clear case cover for my Motorola KRZR and upon receipt the case didnt fit my phone.
1,Case breaks very easily,"The case broke after a week, with relatively little use. The weak points are on the part that fits on the main body, where the wings that hold the case near the keypad seem to be under a lot of stress, which varies as the phone is opened and closed - all fine conditions for crack propagation. The problem seems to be that both the plastic is too brittle and the design puts it under considerable stress in an effort to keep the cover on. The shape is fine, leaving the USB port and camera uncovered. It fits on nicely, but it is much too fragile to recommend."
1,Try Another case,"My case also had the charger cut out on the wrong side, plus I couldn't get the darn pieces on...i didn't want to force it. Buyer Beware!!!"
3,Stout and lacking elegance,"Mozart: Concertos for piano No27; Concerto for pianos No10I feel some stout and less elegant character for this performance. I wish a little more elegant and delicate performance were mede, as, particularly for concerto No. 27 the atmosphere of resigmation and loneliness are what would move listners most touchingly. ----Contrary to that, I feel as if a strong and fat lady were marching with determination -----"
2,disappointed,"I purchased 3 of these for my daughters. One is hardly played with and is fine. The batteries on the other 2 died within a month. After replacing the batteries, they no longer work because my daughter wore them around her neck and she perspired. Try to figure that one out. I am out $40."
5,exactly as described,"exactly as described,no problems at all with this item.My friend I bought it for Loves it,thanks :) :) :) :)"
1,Poorly designed,"A bumper sticker should have few words in a large simple font so it can be read from a good distance. This sticker is made up of two sentences, one in a small point size in reverse type. In most cases the punch line of this sticker will be missed rendering the set-up meaningless. Short statements or slogans work best."
2,I hope this review will be 'more helpful' than Jack Dempsey,"This bumper sticker does not account for the fact that not everyone is from Europe. Some of us, in fact, are from Pluto."
3,Gimmicky,"This is a very heavy album, with the vocals being exceptional, comparable to Bruce Dickenson. The cover artwork pays tribute to knight heroes of the past. Key tracks are: Crusader, Set Me Free, Sailing to America and Do It All for You. They were one of the leaders/ pioneers of New Wave of British Heavy Metal along with Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Get it to feed your urge."
3,LAST GOOD SAXON ALBUM,"This is the last good SAXON album. Coming after the masterpiece ""POWER AND THE GLORY"", it has great songs. But there is already a clue to what would come in later albuns: the dreadful ballad ""DO IT ALL FOR YOU""..."
4,My Favorite Saxon CD,"This album still sounds good to me 16 years later. Excellent musicianship, great production and a heavy sound make this a great addition to any fan of 80's heavy metal.Favorite songs are: ""Crusader"", ""Do it All For You"", ""A Little Bit of What You Fancy"", and a cover of the Sweet's ""Set Me Free"".Byford has a bit of a high voice, but it goes well with the music and rounds out what I consider to be a timeless classic of mid-80's heavy metal. Enjoy!"
3,Saxon - 'Crusader' (EMI),"I'll give it 3 1/2 stars.Originally released in 1984,this was Saxon's seventh lp.I remember seeing them as support act for Motley Crue on their 'Shout At The Devil' tour.Yes,this really happened.While 'Crusader' may not be the band's best album,it's still very much worth having a copy of.While I've heard other fans comment that 'Crusader' was Saxon's last 'good' lp,that simply isn't the case.In this fan's humble opinion,Saxon to THIS very day,is still able to cut a good record.Tunes I do remember them doing live(their set was nearly as long as the Crue's)was probably the better tracks off the album,which were ""Sailing To America"",the title cut ""Crusader"",""Just Let Me Rock"",""Bad Boys(Like Rock And Roll)"" and maybe the 'sort of' metal anthem ""Rock City"".Rest assure,'Crusader' holds Biff Byford's signature vocals and the crisp guitar sound of axemen Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver fully intact.A decent find."
3,"Not their best, but still good.","After ""Wheels"", ""Strong Arm"", ""Denim"" and ""Power"", this was not exactly their heaviest, finest hour. (Even the band admits it was something of a commercial departure). Nevertheless, it contains some great tunes, including ""Crusader"", ""Sailing to America"" & ""A Little Bit of What You Fancy"". Definitely worth owning, but get the others first."
5,The way rock and roll should be!,"Top of List for Hard Rock. The guitar, drums and bass are some of the best that any group of the 80's ever had. A must for anyone who loves good solid rock."
3,Historic curiousity,"This short volume attempts with fair success to translate 17th century recipes for various dishes and drink into usable modern recipes. The originals are included with the translations, and the volume is sprinkled liberally with quotes from the Pepys diaries and other sources as well as explanatory text. There is even a ""Festive Feast"" dinner with multiple dishes and music suggested.This is fun reading, and the recipes are also enjoyable to try. How close they come to reproducing a 17th century meal may depend on how much imagination you can bring to the experience."
2,Expensive,"This edition was a required text for my film class. A bit overpriced, definitely go for the cheaper 2nd edition if you can."
3,Nice textbook,Nice binding and pages. You can highlight without it bleeding through. It is ok written I manage to not fall asleep while reading chapters for school. It is up to date in its cultural and cinematic references.
1,Not what I expected,"I bought a 45 of Le Geant De Papier back in 1985 while touring Europe, and I was hoping this CD would contain the same song, but at a higher quality. Unfortunately, the feeling on this track is completely different. The electronic sound is gone, a piano now accompanies Lafon, and the reverb is cranked way up. Even the vocals sound different, although I don't know enough French to know if the words have changed. I am disappointed in the result, and I will have to keep looking for a high quality recording of the original 45 cut.One other gripe is that the CD liner is deceptive, listing this album as a compilation. There is no hint that the song has been redone, even the copyright date for the track remains 1985. I have come to distrust Sony music, and this simply reinforces my belief that Sony music products should be purchased with caution."
4,Well recommended history of war psychology,"A fine, well researched history of military psychological practices in the 20th century and easily comprehensible by the layman. As an American, I found the English spelling and punctuation annoying (honourable British writers reverse the use of single and double quotations, don't you know, Love), but you can get past that. I'm sure the British have similiar feelings about the American writing style. I can best compliment War of Nerves by telling you that I am citing it in a book on mental disorders during the American Civil War. Aside from that, I was intrigued by Shephard's thoughts on the creation of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a recognized mental condition, i.e., that it came into the lexicon as much or more from social and political reaction to Vietnam as a step forward in mental evaluation."
3,Plus and Minus,"Good:- Out of the box, this camera is dead easy to start using. From opening the box to taking my first shot it took all of ten minutes.- Responsive zoom feature.- Easy to use software (similar to Photoshop, etc.)- Easy to interface camera and TV for slideshows. All the appropriate plugs are included.Bad:- Like many digital cameras, this model eats batteries. However, I think this one goes through them much faster than others I've experienced.- Short battery life means that its useless to set the date because as soon as you change the batteries you have to re-set the date/time, which isn't easy because:- The cross pad is not responsive. Its small size makes selecting menus options difficult.- The manual is obviously written by non-English speakers. The poor syntax makes reading some of the instructions difficult.- Long lag time between clicking the button and taking the picture."
3,"CD= ok, Live= AMAZING","ok, Now since i am the first person to even probably take a look at this cd on this website...thats a bad sign. Free Sol's 11:11 as a cd, overall is decent...nothing super special or intriguing. Lyrics are sometimes childish (i.e. To keep from crying ima roll up the fattest blunt you've ever seen....wow,deep)...the instrumentals are a mix between the roots and other soul superstars like musiq, eryka badu, and jill scott. BUT and this is a HUGE but, I just saw them Live at a small club in New Orleans and they were AMAZING...honestley, better than the black eyed peas in terms of energy, lyrics....and they played like 6 new songs, (album coming out in 2 months according to the guitarist) and it is going to be HOT, if this group does anything on Cd like they do live, they r gunna Blow Up....so go see thier shows... and buy the CD cuz they are pretty hot...."
4,Rostropovich is definitive Shostakovich interpreter,It seems this Symphony has been resurrected recently and has found a commonplace in the schedules of all the major orchestras. This recording is spectacular but has some very minor drawbacks. The tempi are not followed strictly and the orchestra is too tame at times. Control is good but a little more spark would make this recording flawless. Highly recommended!
4,Darkly satsifying!,"If you're like me, you are absolutely tired of the endless Christian symbolism (even though most of it is used to mock or parody Christian symbolism) in the Goth subculture that we inhabit. Thankfully this jeweler came through for us and made a wonderful pendant that shows both our dark nature and also our Jewish heritage.The pendant is well designed and sturdy, the rope that holds it up is creative with the two knots to tighten the necklace around your neck, though it can be frustrating if you realize suddenly you put it on the wrong way after tightening the knots! It does feel a little heavy, but really that's what you want when you want it to hold close to your chest and not have the pendant move around too much.I am hoping (though it is a more expensive hope!) for this design to made into a silver piece with a silver chain one day. Otherwise, it is probably the best Jewish Goth jewelery piece I have seen yet."
2,Pretty terrible design,"One of these was recently installed by my landlord. The design is pretty terrible. It has numbers on the surface, but they are so far away from anything that moves when you set the temperature that you can't actually see what temperature you've set it to. It also doesn't keep whatever temperature very well; at least in my installation, if I set it to a comfortable temperature, it will wait too start heating until I'm uncomfortably cold, and stop heating when I'm uncomfortably hot. People have told me I'm not particularly sensitive to temperature, so I'm pretty sure it isn't just me."
5,Best of the Lot!,"I recently became interested in tiles and tile-making and ordered a half-dozen books on the topic. This was the one book I'd keep and recommend over all of the others. Frank Giorgini is a teacher's teacher! I felt like I was sitting in on one of his classes. His in-depth knowledge, step-by-step photos and explanations and clear love of the topic are inspirational. Even if you knew nothing about handmade tiles, this book would make you want to start creating them! I especially enjoyed all the examples that were created by various students - there was something for every taste and level of experience. He makes it look do-able and easy. His tips and tricks will save amateurs much suffering. After reading this book, I felt eager to begin designing and creating my own handmade tiles, and confident that I had enough knowledge to do it right.Personal note: I envy his students the opportunity to learn from Frank Giorgini!"
3,Good sounds,Worked correctly in remaster and the new tracks are very well. A classic one form the original formation of Deep Purple.
3,A NON-ROCKER REVIEW BY JACK SPICER,"I DISCOVERED ""ANTHEM"" (CUT #6) DURING THE ROLLING CREDITS OF A MOVIE AND SUBSEQUENTLY BOUGHT THIS ""DEEP PURPLE"" CD. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF MUSIC IN A COLLECTION WHICH BEGAN IN 1955 AND ANY MUSIC I POP FOR NOW MUST BE BE EXCEPTIONAL. ADD TO THAT, THAT I'M NOT A FANCIER OF ROCK MUSIC HAVING GROWN UP WITH FATS WALLER & GLENN MILLER. THE OTHER ELEVEN CUTS MAY BE GOOD, I CAN'T TELL, BUT ""ANTHEM"" IS A 'KEEPER' AND WORTH BUYING THE ALBUM FOR. IT AIN'T GLENN OR FATS, BUT IT WILL TICKLE YOUR MUSICAL SENSIBILITIES."
4,mostly about Muslim integration,"Recently, Holland has been rift with problems of integration of ethnic minorities; especially those from a Muslim background. It has been noticed that some [many?] form enclaves in Holland, and do not speak Dutch well, or even at all. This book, written some 20 years ago, is quite timely today, given this context.It discusses the learning of Dutch as a second language. There are two main ethnic groups surveyed. Surinam and Turkish. The former are from a former colony in South America. Smaller groups, like those from Morocco, are also discussed. Comprehensive statistical analysis is given. The authors have spent considerable effort to understand the efficacies of various teaching methods. Mostly directed towards immigrant children, rather than adults. The conclusions are largely positive. Though in the light on current events, one might have wished for more integration."
3,Good but not great,"One of the reasons I got this product was because of it's size (my former desk was way too big) and because it could fold. Other Winsome products I've purchased that fold (bookcases) got the job done, so I thought this would, too. My biggest complaint is that the pull out shelf for the computer keyboard is sticky on one side and no longer pulls out smoothly. This occurred after a few days use. It seems as if the hardware used for the runners is made of an inferior (soft) metal or something. Mostly, I keep the shelf out, which is no big deal, still....would be nice if it worked the way it was promised to work.Other than that, the piece is nice looking and sturdy. I wouldn't sit or stand on it but when do I have occasion to do that?"
3,"Works as Intended, But What About My Knees?","For anyone wanting yet another piece of furniture, but has space constraints, the Winsome Wood Foldable Desk is an ideal choice.The surface comfortably holds my laptop, a lamp, various desk items, and has space to spare on one side or the other for papers. It folds up easily when I need to slip it out of the way.The major detraction here is the keyboard shelf. If you like to do anything with your legs/knees other than sit in the prim and proper upright position at the desk, then you're in trouble. Removing the shelf is the simple solution, but since it does aid with the stability of the desk, the desk is a wee bit wobbly without it.A side note: Winsome Wood is a name I've known since I was very young. It has a great deal of quality credibility attached to it. And while this desk is all wood and functional, I would have expected something of slightly higher quality given the name. However, I did only pay about $100 for it, so I'm not really complaining."
4,Very nice,"The unit arrives requiring minimal assembly (four wood screws provided with hex driver) to attach the folding top. Note that the hex screw driver is totally inadequate as provided...expect to use a motorized or other serious hex screwdriver to get the screws completely in. I hate to think about other products from this company that must be assembled..it took considerable effort for these simple four screws.The beechwood is solid wood, quite beautiful (needs oil polish to preserve), and somewhat heavy for the size of the item.Overall, I am happy, and the dimensions are such that it fits in a relatively small space."
3,Almost perfect.,The quality of the wood is beautiful however since this is a mission style folding table there is no true support in the front of the desk. I went to Home Depot and spent just 4 dollars on two small sash latches. With these attached to the sides the table is much more sturdy and it still can function as a collapsible table.I am a cabinet maker by trade so trust me when I say that this is nice looking with good wood but as far as function its a 3 out of 5.
2,Poor quality,I wish I had not bought this. The screws keep coming out because the holes are too big in critical locations when I try to fold to to move it. I would not recommend this product .
3,A bit flimsy,"Purchased this last Christmas for my son's room - it looks nice, but it's pretty cheaply made. It's solid wood, but because of the foldable design, is very unstable. Definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a real desk, and wouldn't have bought this if I knew."
2,wobbly,"this thing is compact and stays on its feet... but it makes me nervous because it wobbles if bumped and even slightly while i type. the size is what sold me, but if you have the $ invest in something thats not ""foldable"""
1,Hobby Warehouse and Virtual Inventories send damaged goods,"Received shipment of the Mission Style Computer desk. It was deliver ontime. It was also delivered with damage to the wood, less the instructions and less the screw to finish putting it together that another purchaser had started, stripped the holes, boxed it and sent it back to the company. I paid for a new piece of equipment and instead got a used piece, with less than quality condition, in a box that had been opened, retaped and sent back and with only half of the original equipment. I would not recommend this distributor not Virtual Inventories Inc., (their shipment department) for any form of purchase. They send you the remains of a previous unhappy purchaser with no regard for the fact that you paid up front for an original item. Definitely a""don't shop here"". Not considered ""amazon quality provider""..Win"
1,Winsome Foldable Desk,"Not the same quality I bought 10 years ago. I just wanted to match my Mission style shelves, but it was a disappointment. The wood and craftsmanship are inferior. I bought Foldable 4-Tier Shelf, Foldable Cart and Foldable desk. I kept the first two, but the desk was so bad, huge pieces of broken wood were patched with the wood filler on top and the bottom of the table, I had to return it. I don't recommend this product."
3,Decent but nothing special,"Pro:Solid little desk that does the job.Con:This item is surprisingly flimsy. The instructions direct you to build the product upside down, which I did. While flipping it back over after building it, I did not exercise extreme caution and one of the flimsy legs cracked. The desk is still usable, but I was disappointedThe list price of $199 is absurd. I'm now thinking that $99 is a bit much to ask for it as well. It's seriously just a few bits of finished wood attached together.The product came packaged with large sheets of styrofoam around it. I understand that the product needs protection during shipping, but the styrofoam is the obnoxious kind that crumbles into thousands of little foam bits. Annoying and messy."
5,A perfect little desk,"This desk only requires four screws to put it together, but as another reviewer mentioned, the little Allen wrench they supply is useless. It actually bent before I'd gotten the first screw in more than halfway. Plan to have a sturdier 4mm Allen wrench handy to put it together. Otherwise this is the perfect desk! Since I find myself moving often, this eliminates one more thing that I have to take apart to transport. It simply folds up and is ready to go! The top is just the right size too. It comfortably holds my laptop, printer and other desk paraphernalia. I also like how the keyboard tray extends the whole length of the desk. I tend to use it for extra desk space when I'm working on paperwork or even crafts. Overall, this desk is sturdy, well designed and heavier than expected. The only thing I'd change is the height. While I'm a bit short, this desk is somewhat taller than other desks I've used, and I will be getting an adjustable chair to compensate."
3,foldable desk,"I was a bit surprised when it arrived - as it is a little unstable and the pull out for a key board does not operate very smoothly. But, for the price it is OK."
5,Parcifist notes on WW 1,"Many books have been written about WW I but the way Ellen N. La Motte wrote about the absurdity of war it is simply astonishing. No wonder that her book got banned in France and the US as she doesn't see any heroes on a battlefield, only brutality, barbarity and inhumanity from all sides. ""The Backwash of War"" is a book for all times. Such amazing pacifist notes shouldn't stay hidden. Get it right now."
3,Late shipment with no correspondence,I ordered a generator transfer switch on 8/1/05. This website states that orders usually ship within 1-2 weeks. I's now almost 3 weeks later; I have an electricain scheduled for this weekend and still no switch. You would think someone would have contacted me by now.
5,Super Solutions to our problem pests,We have had a growing problem with woodchucks. This book has easy solutions to solve our problems. User friendly and solutions are no promblem to make with no nasty chemicals.
1,Poorly written and full of errors,"This book has multiple errors, some DANGEROUS misinformation and 95% of the ""Cures"" don't work at all. Seven is NOT safe nor is it organic. It is a white crystal powder insecticide chemically produced. It is toxic and a known carcinogen - very healthy right? Most of the information in this book is repeated multiple times for other pests too making over 1/2 the book fluff. Now errors in information covered we look at his writing skills. This can't be overlooked, there are hundreds of mistakes that are spotted by my 8 year old son. To be clear - the ""cures"" don't work worth a damn, the book is a piss poor source of useful information and following some of the advice is actually HARMFUL to your health."
4,Very informative,I am pleased with the contents of the book. I was looking for alternative pest control and this book seems to have answers.
3,"Helpful, but disappointing in several areas.","The ""cures"" didn't get rid of spiders or water bugs, (roaches), but there were fewer of them.Am hoping that there is a residual effect with some of the products."
5,Great uncommon tips,This book is wide ranging and full of bits of info not found elsewhere. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting pesticide alternatives.
3,So-So,Tried a few tips to get rid certain insects and the results were below par. I plan on trying other ideas from the book for future issues. Maybe have better luck.
2,Questionable information and full of errors,"Although there are a ton of great ideas in this book, it's a difficult book to read due to the lack of an editorial staff.It is not ""all-natural"" as the title implies.Simple spelling errors, grammatical errors, and a lack of organization all give this book 2 stars.I think it ""bugs"" me (pun intended) also that he calls spiders insects. ""Spiders are beneficial insects and are welcome in most homes."" p.46 I know I'm being picky, but it irks me that someone that has studied zoology would make an error like that.Keith"
2,A Lot of Information - poorly organized!,Published in 2005 I thought there would be some color photos. Nope! And no index either which makes it real difficult to find anything. disappointing and frustrating to use.
2,not comfortable,"This is not comfortable at all. Sound quality is ok but not great, but even with the smallest earpiece it was painful after just one minute of use."
2,"Good sound quality, lousy mic","I got this headset hoping it would be an upgrade over the $15-$30 models. The ear piece was fairly comfortable and can be worn for an extended period of time. The sound quality was excellent and the volume was good. The major short coming and the reason I don't use this headset any more was that nobody could hear me. Even with the small boom style mic I constantly got complaints that the person I was speaking to couldn't hear me. I do most my cell phone use in my car, so its not a noisy enviorment. I would suggest trying another headset."
3,Good product. Very uncomfortable earphone sleeves.,"The QuietSpot is a good headset. However, the earphone sleeve is very uncomfortable to wear to a degree that it actually hurts your ear (considering the fact that you need to insert the earphone into your ear, even the small sleeve is not small enough). Unless your ear canal is wide, you may want to consider the alternatives, Jabra for one."
3,Un-familiarity breeds contempt,"While Mr. Peikoff has written a very thought provoking book, this book should be read with a very critical eye. I seriously question whether or not he is familiar with the material he references throughout this book.Specifically, it is readily apparent that Peikoff has never thoroughly understood Nietzsche or the Greeks -- philosophers who he makes broad, sweeping remarks about. At least in the case of Nietzshe, Peikoff is so far off the mark with his understanding of Nietzschean philosophy that his remarks are almost comical as they don't just miss the mark, they quite often posit an opposite meaning.I give this 3 stars simply because the skepticism, dissent, and critique of U.S. governement that ""Ominous Parallels"" instigates is not only worthwhile, it is necessary."
1,A great example of what objectivists have to offer.,Are there any John Galts coming up with a cure for cancer? and new math equation? anything? No No No. All we get from the objectivist is the type of balony found in The Ominous Parallels. A book for and by fanatics. Not science not history just the application of a crazy philosophy to produce a crazy book. The most mediocre people out there today are Objectivist.
1,A great example of what objectivists have to offer.,Are ther any John Galts coming up with a cure for cancer? and new math equation? anything? No No No. All we get from the objectivist is the type of balony found in Ominous Parrells.
1,"Great Music, Poor Recording",Zorba The Greek has always been one of my favorite soundtrack recordings. I was looking forward to receiving the recording without dialogue. To my dismay the CD sounds like it was reproduced from an early record release because of all of the pops and hiss that occur throughout the recording. A major disappointment.
1,You get what you pay for.,"The black plastic bristles break off because they become brittle immediately. Though I have used this only about three months, it is about half bare of bristles. (Those are also a lot of fun to pick up off the floor and counter.) I was surprised because the one I used for years was Vidal Sassoon, but this is just a cheap disposable curler."
5,a powerful spiritual epic,over the summer i immersed myslef in the fantastical world of the hindu pantheon by reading epics such as the ramayana and mahabharata.i personally despise abridged editions of any book but since i had some free time on my hand i had a had a good read through this abridged version. in my eyes it failed to capture the poetic splendour of the complete version{which i had read a week earlier consisting of 1600 pages} but earned my respect in its attempt.
3,Ramayana,"This is a real easy to read version, reads more like a novel versus scripture which is what is suppose to be in Santana Dharma."
3,A very famous story but...,"I read this book with great interest. Certainly the story of Rama's tale is exciting and one that is recounted many time in the East. However, in reading the story, one thing kept getting in the way: the book keeps praising the virtues of Brahmins non-stop. After a while, this ceaseless glorification of Brahmins became extremely annoying, at least for a non-Indian like me. I am speculating here but the story of Ramayana probably had a big influence in the way the caste system in India evolve through the centuries."
2,this cd is trash,i keep hearing how good the get up kids are soooo... i go out and buy this cd. i pop it in my cd player. a couple of songs i relize it is trash. i can't see why people like this cd so much. i bought the alkaline trio to when i bought this cd....that cd is far better.
2,the sit down and whine kids!,"here me out. im not a fan of emo or anything emo inspired at all. so when my normally punk listening to friend recommended this cd, i was expecting to hear punk, not emo. this is not even good emo. i honestly dont know what this is. i listened to this cd over and over again trying to like SOMETHING about it, and those are hours i will never have back. the lyrics are consistently bitter and spiteful on EVERY SINGLE TRACK. the vocals are quite bad, i really dont think that pope was making any sort of attempt to sing in key. (or any sort of ""key"" near it) but maybe that is what emo is all about, i dont know. if you MUST buy this album, buy it used. anything more than that is not worth it."
4,God Bless Emo,"There is not much i can really say about this that hasnt been said.... Yes this album is alluringly rough around the edges, yes this album very much grows on you, yes this is emo. And we all love emo right?I have owned this album for what seems like forever and always dismissed it up till now. I play it over and over and over to the extent that all my friends know every word due to over exposure.This is a much harder and grittier sound that retains some of the ""Core"" of emo. Unlike some of the pretty keyboards on ...Home About, this is all about rocking guitars and more strained vocals.Were i to criticise i would moan about the lack of any shouting in any of the choruses. I would moan about the fact that it isnt the heaviest emo i have ever heard and they arent quite Saves The Day. But if you like your emo lite, than this is the band to try!"
1,HUH?!!,"I just don't get it. I picked up ""Something To Write Home About"" a year ago after reading a good review of it in some mag. That's a good record; defintely nothing groundbreaking, but a good energetic, emo album. So I figured, why not try ""Four Minute Mile"". When I played it the first time I didn't like it at all, but I gave it a chance and listened several times to see if there was something I was missing...there wasn't!! Ok, now... there's nothing wrong with raw, under-produced albums. Some of my favorite albums are just that,(Operation Ivy, Rites Of Spring, Sebadoh, Pavement, every hardcore album from the late 80s & early 90s)but this one just dosen't work. If you're gonna make an album in this emo/punk/pop..whatever style, you should probably be able to keep the vocals, as well as the guitars, in tune with each other because wheather GUK fans want to admit it or not these guys are mostly pop."
3,They Are Not For MTV,"its a pretty good poppy cd. after about half of the cd i have to take it out because i can't deal with the whiny pop sound. their appearance on MTV made me dislike them. it is a good cd, but since they went on MTV i have to give it only 3 stars. it you like these guys you have to pick up stuff from promise ring, cap'n jazz, and saves the day"
5,beyond groovy!,"The best cd I've listened to this past year. Also two of the best shows I've seen in the past year. Every track's a keeper. My favorites are ""Fall Semester"" and ""No Love"". Good stuff all around."
5,looking for the best music that totally rocks....found one,This is one of the few cd's you don't need to hit random. It has great lyrics and a great beat. You can really get involved in the music no matter where your at.
5,A song every Mother can relate to,"My daughter who's 8 is a true Spice fan. She sings the songs everyday. The person who wrote the song ""Mama"" has touched every mother's heart. Whenever it's playing in our home, I drop what I'm doing and kiss my daughter. She's so special to me and I want her to know she's always loved. It's a great song to show ""girl power"" can easily be carried from one generation to the next. It's very much my favourite song and I do enjoy most of them.Let's hope Mel B and Victoria now get to enjoy singing this to their children.""Mama, I love you.. Mama I care....."
5,It's excellent and should've been released in the U.S.,"Personally, instead of ""2 Become 1"", ""Mama"" AND ""Who Do You Think You Are"" should've been released in the States and it's incredibly unfair us Americans have to wait until we get the CD to hear these beautiful (in ""Mama's"" case) or happy pop (in Who Do You Think You Are's"" case) tunes from the Girls...Ginger-less or not."
1,2500d review,"its my belief that this unit is plagued with a cooling design flaw. It trips after only 30 mins of play due to heat. I bought 2 and they both have the same issue. Unless you plan on mounting this unit under a fan or your car's a/c vent, I dont recommend this product."
3,Off to a good start,"I would give this item a total of 3.5 stars(if it were an option.) I believe that this is a good way to begin your PCAT study, it kinda just breaks the ice. But, it seems a little simple in comparison to the kind of questions asked by the Kaplan books(Kaplan was said to be the only company with actual access to the old PCAT exams.) Therefore, I would recommend this title, but mainly to break the ice for the real studying!"
1,I wasted my hard earned money.,"I bought this book to practice in between classes. The math portion did not prepare me for the PCAT and, like another reviewer said, some of the answers and explantions were wrong. It cost me valuable points. I should have paid the extra money for the Kaplan book."
1,Flashcards aren't useful if they're wrong,"I purchased this book years ago hoping for a good review. After a few pages, I discovered that one of the answers for a mathematics question was incorrect. I reworked it several times and consequently chucked it after realizing that I had it right the first time...and the second...and the tenth.I managed a great PCAT score sans the use of this review book. It's not a worthwhile purchase -- find yourself a resource that actually does what it's supposed to: help."
3,Sometimes Repeats Questions,"A decent PCAT review. My wife used it to study and was pleased with her score. Some of the answers were wrong, however, particularly in the math section, and the explanations for which answer was correct were often unnecessarily complicated."
3,"Helpful book, but beware...","This book is useful if you want to prepare for the PCAT at those odd free moments throughout the day. The book does not discuss the essay part, only the multiple choice questions. However, the book also has typo's and incomplete answers. For example: Q-122 regarding the areas of 2 circles correctly picks answer C but contains a typo in the equation. Otherwise the book is well worth the price."
4,Does the job!,Just what I was looking for.Fits my creative like a glove and offers protection at a modest price.
5,Very pleased,"I bought this camera 2 years ago and have not been disappointed. I haven't had any problems and I'm very pleased with the quality of pics this camera gives. I have had no problems with grainy pics, or taking pics indoors or out. It also has a great red eye reduction feature and I never have to do touch up to get the red out of eyes.I did purchase rechargable batteries because it does go through regular batteries quite fast. But since I've started using the rechargable batteries, I've had no complaints!I really believe it's how you use it and what you're using it for on how you'll feel about this digital. I'm very glad I purchased it."
1,Grainy,"This camera on paper looks great; a solid build, optical zoom and a 2.0 megapixel resolution all at a cheap price. It sounds great. Unfortunately my tests at using it indoors produced poor results. The pictures (on any detail setting) suggested that they were taken using a 256 colour mode or worse. Images were grainy and transition between similar colours gave an unnacceptable pixelated effect. This camera was supposed to be an upgrade for a Creative Labs PC-600 1.3 megapixel camera. Comparing the pictures showed that I should have stuck with what I already had."
2,LOOK FOR ANOTHER BRAND BATTERY EATER,"HAD IT FOR 1 YEAR AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR, NEVER WORKED AGAIN.In addition the battery life is about 30 pictures and indoor pictures are not good at all"
2,"Low price, low quality",Attractive price but poor build material and usefulness. Poorly ground up the herb and gets stuck in top section all the time. Stopped using it after I found metal shavings from the poor design that started grinding metal flakes inside the grinder. I'll be more careful in picking my next grinder.
3,La Traviata is not match with Edita Gruberova,"I like the voice of Edita Gruberova. Her cold and straight voice is very beautiful. So according to her voice, I think she does not match with the role which is full of energy."
5,"It's fast, it's fun, it's inexpensive...AND IT WORKS!","Everybody is interested in ""core strengthening"" these days, and this program offers many of the benefits of Pilates---including improved flexibility and balance, better posture, a lithe ""dancers"" body---but without the expense and inconvenience of classes or costly equipment. The quick results, variety, portability and low cost of this workout will appeal to all busy women."
1,Save your money!!!!,"I just want to warn you about this companies equipment. They don't stand behind it at all. So far I have owned 2 of their prodects and neither one has lasted 1 year. Unfortunately, their warentee is for 90 days. This Portable DVD players battery never worked (I brought 3 of them back before I got one that worked and that one stopped working after 40 days...and the batteries only warenteed for 30 days). This company does not stand behind their products and their customer service...well I guess they call it that...is useless. Trust me...don't buy anything from them. Save your money!!!"
4,Not bad for the price,"I got this Apex PD10 on Ebay for $165 new. Lowest price I could find anywhere on the net.I read alot of reviews about the unit getting very hot while being used, not the case with mine. Don't know if it's because I don't put it flat on the surface of the table (back end propped up) or if thats just how this unit is. The picture is pretty clear, color is alittle on the red side, the color control doesn't do much good. I wish it had direction controls on the unit itself, you have to navigate with the remote. Not always easy. Esp. if you have big fingers. The 5.6"" screen is big enough, I don't have a problem viewing anything. Does have a zoom feature but keeps a smaller pic of the org. in the upper left corner so it blocks part of the zoomed pic. weird.All in all, a decent Dvd player. If I had more time to really look at more (taking it on a trip), I would probably spend alittle more and get a different one though."
1,my first portable and most likely my last,"if this is the shoddiness i am to expect out of a portable dvd player then i will never buy another.first, the thing isn't even a widescreen display like in the picture.secondly, the thing practically cooks the discs, they get so hot.third, if you lose a little part, you're screwed. Apex, doesn't offer replacements. i lost the remote, and now i can't access anything, i have to hit play and i can only see the movie. good luck with TV show DVDs that have you individually select episodes.it seems like nothing but negative complaints as we continue:when you turn the unit on its side to turn up the volume it starts to scratch the disc up. oh, and did i mention the extreme heat!Do yourself a favor, save yourself some money and buy a better brand, because you will have nothing but problems with this!"
3,Good Product,"Feature wise this is one of the best portable DVD player out. I really like having a/v input / output on the device it self. :) :)!Picture and sound quality pretty much sticks.After having it for a year now i am going to upgrade to one that has a bigger screen size and better sound quality for only a few $ more. I will miss having the a/v input / output though.But again if you want the features get this, also it is a very good price for what you get."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this to pass the time on some road trips for myself and my kids. I was very much lured in by the low price. What's the old adage - you get what you pay for. Of the first 3 DVD's I played, it had trouble with 2 of the 3. It would skip, freeze, and otherwise not track well. I thought that maybe it just didn't do well in the car, but the same problems persisted sitting on a flat table in the house. Hence, back it went, and no more APEX products for me."
2,"Well, at least mine last longer than the others...","I received this player as a gift over 3 years ago. The remote has never worked quite right and I typically had to be no less than 4 inches from the screen in order for it to work. I just figured that since it was a portable player, it wasn't meant to function across a small dorm room. Apparently the engineers didn't factor in the possiblity of using this to play DVDs on a regular tv. Let me just say now that the DVD player received very little use until this year. Within 3 months of increased usage - what my friends still term sub-normal - it has completely died. The warrenty's been expired, so I'm not going to bother paying to send it off."
1,Bad Item,"After a few minets of play the DVD gets real HOT to the touch, DVDs inside get real hot......After less than 5 months Moter burns out .......DONT BUY ONE OF THESE"
3,"Decent quality, bulky battery, good value","What can you expect? Just 18 months ago one of these things cost almost a month's after-tax take-home pay, and now it's just some spare change. Of course you won't get Panasonic or Toshiba quality, but that's not what Apex has come to be known for. Like other Apex products, this DVD player works, and delivers quite some value. My biggest gripe is the big battery, which seems to add another 3 pounds to the DVD player."
3,apex pd-10 review,"we bought this at circuit city to keep my 2 year old daughter occupied on the trip from chicago to minneapolis. we rented 5 dvd's at blockbuster for the trip. there were good and bad points to this player. BAD: 1) player froze up sometimes, and this was on interstate freeway, not exactly that bumpy. seemed like the generic or copied disks froze up more than 'factory' disks. 2) the audio is useless as you can just barely hear it. i will have to research hooking up to car stereo if we keep it. GOOD: 1) hooked up to the home tv easily and played fine. you get what you pay for, but in a mobile i need the thing not to freeze so much."
5,Come Home,"I saw Eugene Bridges at the 2005 Pocono Blues Festival and he was sensational. I wish that hour was tripled. He largely lives, plays and tours in Europe, so we don't get a chance to see him much in the U.S. It's a shame, too. I purchased this cd because the band he was playing with at Pocono was on the cd and he played most of the cd live. Just flat out great blues, super voice, excellent guitar work. I can't say enough about the cd except I am buying his other two."
2,Spanish Fig Cake,The cake was very very dry. The photos made it appear more appetizing. Nice chunks of almonds but I don't think I'll be ordering this again.
4,The Beat Goes On,"Earl Palmer is an incredibly important figure in pop music. His drumming virtually defines early rock 'n' roll, especially his recordings for the Specialty label in the 1950's.It was great to hear him talk about his early years and how he became such a major performer in the studios of New Orleans and Hollywood.It is also fascinating to hear him talk aout his desire to be a bebop drummer.As a result of reading this book I went out and bought a whole bunch of records with Palmer.Anyone interested in the roots of rock or in what makes a good drummer should read this book."
2,NOT the best Dante on Record!,"This recording is good, but James Conlon's version on the Erato Label is THE BEST, thus far, and the one to beat. This is unquestionably a major masterpiece by Liszt and along with the Faust Symphony they are the most advanced harmonically and profound emotionally of all symphonies penned in the Mid-Romantic Era. Daniel's Dante sonata is down right dull, and since other versions of the symphony are superior and since the other reviewers here kicked the overall vote way too high I must give it 2 stars. It could have gotten 3 otherwise."
4,DId I miss something?,"Just bought the game and spent the last couple nights playing it. The worst thing about this game, is there is no cockpit view that I could find..perhaps I am missing something, but that was one of the better features of previous games. In this game you get chase views and hood view, but no cockpit view."
2,Great game gone bad (just like NASCAR),What a dissapointment ! The graphics are subpar and choppy to the point of distraction. The various game modes are unique and entertaining. Did I mention the poor graphics?The pop-up cell phone is annoying and insulting. Congradulations to EA sports for becoming another NASCAR advertising puppet. Maybe in the next version you can incorporate the NASCAR mid-season rule changes.The 2004 version is a diamond compared to this peice of coal.
1,Disappointing,Tried the game last night using both the controller and a MadCatz II steering wheel. Steering controls were terrible on both ... to the point that the game was unplayable. VERY disappointing!
4,A good analysis with frills,"Stripped of all the guesswork about the motives of the Brethren who decided in favor of Bush in Bush v. Gore, SUPREME INJUSTICE is still a damning indictment of the reasoning expressed by the five justices in the majority. His guesswork and unattributed quotes weaken Dershowitz's arguments, and what he has written will do little to change the minds of the partisan readers. But then the book was probably not intended to convince so much as to express indignation at judges who seemed to conveniently forget their own past opinions in a case that will be discussed over and over again for generations to come. If you have any interest in how the Bush v. Gore decision was made, and whatever your own feelings about the presidential election of 2000, you should read this well documented critique of the Supreme Court's role in that debacle."
3,"A ""Must Read"" , But a Tad Redundant.","I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be very informative. However, I felt that after the author made his point, i.e., established his case, he then felt compelled to restate it to the point of ""overkill"". I got the impression this was a legal brief expanded to book length .Nevertheless,I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand why and how the Court did what it did."
4,Partisan outcomes have priority over legal principles?,"If you were baffled and outraged by the U.S. Supreme Court's role in deciding the presidential election of 2000 with its controversial ruling in Bush v. Gore your not alone. There are millions. Legal expert Alan M. Dershowitz addresses this controversy head-on. Dershowitz argues that in this case for the first time, the court's majority let its desire for a particular partisan outcome have priority over legal principles. Dershowitz goes on to say that the involvement of the court has severely compromised the Court's role in national affairs. The Court he says once had held a unique place in our system of checks and balances; it is now seen as a decision maker that reeks of partisan politics. No matter what your opinion is about who won or who lost this book brings you good insight to one of Americas leading legal minds and takes us on a step-by-step journey in one of Nations most controversial decisions.FinancialNeeds.com"
3,A law review article masquerading as a book,"While I more or less agree with Dershowitz's analysis, I find this book annoying because it was clearly hastily written. For one thing, it is tremendously repetitive. There are 206 pages of text, not counting footnotes, and about 60-70 pages could easily be cut out. The reader is lucky if Dershowitz merely repeats something once, since usually he repeats things three or four times--often using the same language. Plus, there are silly mistakes which someone of Dershowitz's stature shouldn't make. For instance, in a footnote, he tells us that first Thomas and then Souter joined the Court when actually it was the other way around. All in all, while people interested in the Court will probably want to read this book, save your money and take it out of the library."
4,"finally,the truth.","...Dershowitz speaks the truth, the book IS indeed an accurate portrayal of the recent presidential appointment...."
2,First chapter is all you need to read,"I agree with the arguments in the book, but as I progressed past the first chapter I got the feeling the Author was strecthing it out to turn his magazine article into a book."
3,Dershowitz is eloquent,"I couldn't be surprised that Alan Dershowitz wrote an eloquent appraisal of the Florida situation as it relates to the Supreme Court. He brings his opinion forward with the same passion we saw while he was lobbying in Florida during the election aftermath. The only tarnish I can see on his stance is that he would have probably been a nominee to the Supreme Court should Gore have won. His motivation seems to be to keep criticism of the Supreme Court alive until 2004 when he may have one last opportunity to help a presidential candidate that could yet name him to the bench. I see the clock ticking for Dershowitz in this regard, and it is reflected in the passionate writing."
4,judicial history defiled,I have always loved history however the decision bushvs gore was appalling.The author certainly provedhis case to me and most patriotic citizens should read this book.The integrity of our judicial is in jeopardy.Our founding fathers predicted that selfserving men women would come along in the future and try to bend the court to partial political findings.I suggest that everyone should read John Adams along with this book so they realize the struggle for independence and freedom in this country and the brave men and women that brought it about.We havea great wonderful country and we must protect our freedom from partial judges.
2,Slickly manipulative,"The problem with books like these is that their authors use their academic credentials to legitimize what is, in essence, partisan propaganda. Such is the case here, though I suppose one must give Mr. Derschowitz due credit for at least not trying to hide his agenda in his choice of a title. It is, after all, quite clear that he is biased wholly in favor of Al Gore, and makes little effort to examine the issue in a fair and evenhanded manner. This is a natural and laudable action for a lawyer defending a client, but here he is presenting himself as a legal expert supposedly examining only the facts of the case, which is, of course, highly misleading. Mr. Derschowitz is instead arguing for his ""client"", Al Gore, and, had the shoe been on the other foot, he'd have presented equally passionate arguments for Mr. Bush."
4,Seems to leave no stone unturned,"As a layman, it seems to me that Dershowitz and his assistants have left no stone unturned in describing why the Supreme Court's decision to even *accept* Bush v. Gore made no sense, as well as the ultimate decision reached by the majority. Dershowitz et al point to Constitutional law, prior case, and prior decisions by these very justices, as well as their opportunity for personal gain. Comparisons are made to cases where the death penalty is involved - - theoretically a loss of life is pretty important, yet cases were not accepted, or decided inconsistently from this one. The reasoning seems very solid to me, and I'm glad I'm reading it. The tone, perhaps, is too angryor strident, though, to convert anyone who agreed with the Supreme Court decision. The book makes me want to invite five robed justices over for a BBQ and a little chat."
4,Too long . . but still good,"I enjoyed this book and Dershowitz's commentary. I agree with Dershowitz, about the 2000 election but also think that his argument could have been much shorter. Overall, however, it was a quick and informative read written easily for all of us that are not accustomed to legalise. Skim this book and get the main ideas, but don't spend too long - there are too many other good books out there."
1,Partisan Drivel,Partisan Drivel. Several different newspapers commissioned recounts and not one came up with the conclusion Al Gore won.What about the partisan behavior of the Florida Supreme Court?What about the Democratic controlled Civil Rights Commision refusing to publish the disenting opinon of the minority members of the commision? The Supreme Court's minority got to publish their opinon.
1,Sour Grapes,"This book made me laugh. If I had picked it from the humor section, I'd give it a five star rating. Dershowitz has been howling mad since December, when he and Rev. Jackson were making wholly unsubstantiated claims of election tampering by Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris. The reasoning in this book is overly biased, and the facts of the case are highly distorted, if not entirely fabricated. In six months this book will be in the bargain bin."
1,A Man Who Knows Corruption...,"This book isn't worth the paper on which it is printed. This is the same man who defended the most corrupt President the United States has ever had and then has the nerve to turn around and call the Supreme Court ""corrupt."" One has to suppose that had the Supremes decided in Gore's favor that Mr. Dershowitz would have applauded the decision as ""bold"" and ""courageous."" It seems as though Mr. Dershowitz likes the ""Silly Putty"" view of the law and the Constitution. . .stretch it to fits one's personal political views and you've got good law--unless of course his side ends up on the losing side."
1,Biased,"This book was written by a man that has a very one-sided view of what happened in Florida. The basic truth is that the US Supreme court did not decide this election, but only stopped the Florida Supreme court from violating the US constitution. While this book has a lot of interesting facts, I felt like there was a lot missing that really pertains to what this book is trying to drive home. Another book that will give the other side of the story is ""At Any Cost : How Al Gore Tried to Steal the Election"" by Bill Sammon."
1,Partisan Politics as usual,"Being a liberal lawyer makes this book very one sided. He shows his bias in every thing he writes, it is as if he was defending his client Al Gore, which I suppose he was. If Mr Dershowitz had been a conservative lawyer he would be hearalding the decision by the supreme court and the book would be defending that decision.If you are looking for a true bi-partisan look at the legal issues revolving around the supreme cout decision, this book is not for you. Buf if you are a liberal and want to read something from a liberal to help solidify your feelings then read this book"
5,The Truth about the Election and The Supreme Court,"This is a concise, extremely readable explanation of how the Supreme Court ignored their oaths (at least 5 of them) in order to choose a winner in the 2000 election. Dershowitz also explains how we got to the point where the Supreme Court could act in such a manner, and suggests means to avoid similar problems in the future. One of his more interesting theories is how the Roe v. Wade decision and other related cases led to a court of idealogues who would allow themselves to be compromised as this court was. I couldn't put this book down. He does not get bogged down in conspiracy theories about irregularities in the vote or any of the other unusual occurrences. The book focuses purely on the Supreme Court and their role in the election."
1,What is wrong with people,"So I tried getting ahold of the seller since the phone didn't work with my phone plan. Since the seller ignored me, I gave the rip off phone to somebody with a TMobile plan only to find out that the phone doesn't work at all. PLEASE do not get ripped off by this seller!!"
5,Great soundtrack,"I love it. Actually, I like Ruins better, but the main reason I want to post this at all is 'cause if some people are put off by it not including 'Shine' (the credits theme) know that you can legally download the full song from Mr Big's site (""http://www.mrbigsite.com/discography.html"", it is on the left hand side). So if you like Hellsing, this is a great CD and you can still complete the soundtrack."
5,Excellent CD,Yasushi Ishii did a great job. i havent been able to remove this from my cd player in a month.
2,Horrible explanations,"This book is not a very in-depth book on the principles of california real estate. It covered topics only very breifly, and really sped through them with not a whole lot of explanation. I would highly advise buying a different book if you intend to pass the CA Real Estate Licensing Exam."
5,Helped ME pass the test.,This is an excellent general introduction to the principles of California real estate. I passed the broker's exam on the first try with no experience as a real estate salesperson and no cram course. This book was a great help in preparing for it. A large percentage of the test questions deal with the principles covered in this book.
1,Error,"I am really disappointed in these. The first test worked and gave an accurate negative results. The others used over the next few months both gave the book error meaning a reading couldn't be obtained. This happened despite following the directions. (Really, not that difficult a task.) I would not buy again."
1,False pregnant reading,Took these clearblue tests with my daughter and came out positive.Started feeling sick every day and the same symptoms as I had with her so took 2 tests( the ones that say pregnant and how far along u are or not pregnant.Well I took 2 both came back (positive 2-3)Because a friend told me she had a false pregnant on these I took another first response and it said negative. Took another tesco brand test last week also says negative.I'm so upset....
1,HORRIBLE!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,"Had the 5 pack of Clearblue Digital. Took the test after period was due, NOT EARLY. 4 of 5 said ""pregnant"". I took a couple first reponse as well after reading the reviews on Clearblue, they both came up negative. The next day, my period came. After reading reviews, and going through the same situation as most, I am not sure how it is aloud that they can even be on the shelves. That is very terrible to have your hopes up like that. Not just one test, but 4 of them came up as positive. I have told many people who are also trying to have a baby not to buy this product and to pass it on. Wouldn't want someone else to go through the same disappointment I did."
4,clear blue digital,"I was very pleased with the clear blue digital preg test. They are easy to use, understand and worth the price. Trying to decide if you see a line or no line or a faint line on all the others really can make you crazy! The easy to read screen is wonderful! Only issue I had was that there are acutally only 3 test sticks in this package when the discription says 4."
1,Crushed our hopes!,"I was having symptoms.........so I thought, so I took a test and it came out positive! I was so excited and I called my husband immediately. I also told 3 friends, and thank goodness I didn't tell the family as I wanted to confirm it w/ my doc. I will be cancelling my doctor's appt for this week as I took 2 more tests, 1 same brand and a diff. brand and they both came out negative. 3 days later.........I am so disappointed, at first I thought, a chemical pregnancy, but then I saw these reviews and am disgusted!"
4,Maybe too sensitive,"I have a documented history of early m/c's. The Clear Blue digital now reads hcg at 25mcg or less. Last month I used a CBE digital and received a positive. I also used three other brands and received a positive on them the same day as well. A blood test showed borderline result. What I learned from the nurse is, HCG can stay in your pee longer than in your blood. If you had low levels, it is possible to get conflicting results. The next day, my temperature started dropping and new tests read negative (including another CBE digital).So, one day can make a big difference in your result.Technology might be a little too advanced for my sanity. But, I'll keep using them and maybe one day will have a miracle!Also, you shouldn't tear it open to read the lines. They don't mean the same as a non digital test."
2,"Good concept, but . . .","The digital readout screen is a great concept and I understand why women chose this test over the standard stick test (myself included). Unfortunately, the mechanics behind it need some tweaking.I used one test on Monday and it said ""Not Pregnant"". Then I used the other test stick on Wednesday and it said ""Pregnant"". I was elated, BUT not about to go and tell ANYONE that I'm ""pregnant"". To be sure I took a standard stick test (E.P.T.) today it came up ""not pregnant"" . . . I got my period two hours later and 4 days late.To be hundred sure you are in fact pregnant, women should see their doctor before telling family, friends, and co-workers. That's just common sense."
2,Not worth paying extra for,"I've used many different types of pregnancy tests ranging from store brands to expensive name brands and I have to say, this one (which I would consider a more expensive name brand) is not worth paying extra for. It's major feature is that it clearly reads ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant"" on the indicator, but other than that, you pee on it and the collection part of the stick is not any larger or easier to use and it gives you results in the same amount of time as any other test I've used. It was accurate for me, so that is not an issue. Overall, if you can't figure out how to read a traditional pregnancy test, which simply has a ""+"" or ""-"", then this is the test for you, but if that is the case, perhaps you should seriously reconsider having kids."
1,If you are a frequent HPT taker...don't use this one!,"I had an absolutely terrible time with this HPT. The assembly and everything is fine...very self explanatory. I took the test and it read negative. I then took the test stick out to throw it away and noticed two lines on the stick. I, being someone who has taken A LOT of pregnancy tests, know that two lines means pregnant. I then called the company to ask them about this problem. The woman on the phone was VERY rude and explained to me that the stick was not to be read except with the digital reader. I then asked her...well why are there two lines but it still says negative. She then proceeded to tell me that I needed to read the instructions and ""somehow"" we got disconnected. I still do not know if I am pregnant or not. But when I do finally test again, I will be using a regular ""plus"" or ""minus"" one from now on."
1,heart broken,I want the words I read to be true with the first test I took. However other test said not prego. My heart aches right now I can now only hope that I can soon get pregnant.
2,took this a few days ago got 2 not pregnants,"i had my tubes cut about 5 yrs ago i recently have been sick and not filling well and i took a home pregnancy test ept i thank and it said i was pregnant so i was like what, but i thought maybe i was reading it wrong so i took alot of pregnancy test over the pass wk r two and had a few come back as pregnant and a about 2 say no so i decieded to take this test cause it says it in words and i was due for my pd but it wasnt here and i know its late, so i took this and got two not pregnants and was like ok so then i went to the dr yesterday to get a blood test done to make for sure and the dr said the blood test said no. then just to check i bought 1 dollar tree test and a box of clearblue test that say - for not and + for pregnant and i took them all 3 and they all 3 came back as pregnant so whats is up with this test r am i having problems with the test i dont no just thought id tell u"
1,PIECE OF CRAP!!,"I bought a 2 pack of Clearblue Easy Digital pregnancy tests and neither worked. The first one gave me the see leaflet sign and the 2nd one flashed pregnant, not, timer symbol and see leaflet over and over again. It is so strange. Its like a demonized test. I glanced down and saw pregnant and nearly jumped out of my seat, then it flashed not, then the timer and so on. After 2 mins of that its decided to finally work semi-normally and flashed the timer sign and then finally ""pregnant."" I do not trust this at all. I will definitely be testing again but NEVER with another one of these. Not only did I venture out with a very cranky child but I wasted $$$ on these pieces of crap!!"
1,Thanks for nothing! FALSE POSITIVE,Just got my period yesterday after thinking I was 6 weeks pregnant! What a joke...a very bad joke! This should be taken off the market. I will never buy again! Good luck to all ttc!
1,False Positive,"I just returned from the doctor's office and found out I am not pregnant, despite the positive read from Clear Blue Easy. Still in disbelief, I took another test and sure enough it says positive too. This test obviously needs to go back to the lab. After two miscarriages, this is a tremendous disappointment."
1,3 flase positives,My huband and I have been disappointed three times by this product during two different months. My doctor confirmed that we are not pregnant with both blood and urine tests. Clearblue will only refund for one test.My doctor has ruled out ovarian cysts with an ultrasound and I'm not on meds so false positives can occur with this product. buyer beware!!!
1,False Positive,"I have never written a review for anything on the internet, but felt compelled to say that I received a false positive with the digital Clearblue pregnancy test. I have never heard of false positives with HPTs until it happened to me. I called the company, and they said that it's extremely rare unless you're taking fertility medications (which I never have). Very heartbreaking and frustrating that a 99% accurate digital test produces a false positive - I understand false negatives and pregnancy tests, but I am really upset about a false positive. I would not use this product again."
1,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT DON""T BELEIVE IT!!!","I have been trying to conceive for 3 months without any luck, so I was thrilled this month to finally recieve a postitive result. Before I told my husband I took 2 more test just to make sure, all 3 were positive. Just to get my period 2 days later and find out at the doctor I was never pregnant to begin with. Don't waste your money on Clearblue easy, it will only lead to dissapointment."
1,"False Positive, Devastating","I took this test and got a clear ""Pregnant"" result. I then read about the false positives experience of others and took two other brands of tests and received negatives on both of them. I also took another test out of this box and it came back ""Not Pregnant."" Buyer beware! Do not purchase! It has been confirmed I am NOT pregnant."
1,What crap...,"I will never use this brand again. I was getting faint positives on conventional tests and decided to run to get digital to confirm. Came out prego. What a disappointment when i couldn't replicate the results on subsequent digitals of the same and different brands. Less than 24 hours later, period comes. Now the company would argue miscarriage but I doubt that was the case yesterday when I took more digital tests 3-4 hours after my ""pregnant"" and those all came back ""not pregnant"". Anyways, false positives are suppose to be very rare but I guess if you want to get your hopes up or play a cruel joke on someone this is the way to go..."
4,Easy enough to read.,"I used this test and also had a friend who is pregnant use this test. The way that the readout works is that the words ""not pregnant"" are printed in the screen, and either just ""pregnant"" or ""not"" and ""pregnant"" show up depending on the result. While the readout is clear in both cases, you can faintly see the ""not"" even when the readout is ""pregnant"". I can see this as potentially being confusing. It was accurate for both me and my friend, but your mileage may vary.The instructions were clear and easy to read. The packaging was a little overmuch. I definitely feel like the packaging could be reduced to be more eco-friendly."
5,Very easy to use and easy to read.,"Not much to say other than it works are advertised. Easy to read. However, it is a lot more expensive than other kinds that are just as easy to read."
1,False positive,"Just used this test at 8 days past a 5-day transfer (equivalent to 13 days past ovulation; I did IVF) and was quite excited to see ""Pregnant"" show up. However, 2 other non-digital tests (supposedly with greater sensitivity to detect HCG) showed negatives. Beta HCG confirmed -- not pregnant."
1,False Positive,"Stay clear of this test. Took a test first thing in the morning recently and it almost instantly came out positive. However, later that day, another test came out negative. Tried again next morning with different brand, but again had a negative. Went to doctor next day (already had appointment) and they performed both quantitative and qualitative blood tests and both came out negative. I am not menopausal, am not on fertility drugs or any other medications, have no health issues, and performed test as it instructed to.Be warned."
4,Easy to use and fairly accurate,The product as any pregnancy test product offers 99% accuracy as it claims and it is fairly easy to use and the results easy to interpret.
3,Easy to Read Results,There isn't too much I can say about this product. It did it's duty and informed us quickly we had nothing to worry about.It's the little things like that which really matter -- the reassurances in stressful times.
1,Disappointed,"I took this test more than 4 months ago and it was positive. I was joyful for 1 day. The next day I started bleeding. I would have only been 2 months, but still, I was upset and thought I was having a miscarriage. I just took one tonite and the hourglass went for the alotted time then it just went blank... I read all these reviews while looking for a way to fix it. Now I'm thinking that maybe I just had a heavy period and it was not a miscarriage??? I have never had problems with any HPTs. I found out I was pregnant with my daughter with one from the $1 store! I just don't trust it! BTW the tests came from the same box- I'm not sure if 4 months is enough to have it expire, but tonite it leaves me with unanswered ?s. Truly disappointed and going back to the store to spend more money!!!"
1,Punishment product!!!,"The worst product ever!!! It proved again that the cost of product doesn't always speak for its quality. My wife got the same experience as the real people here. Please ignore those 5-star reviews, which clearly shown are written by the company to boost their review. Maybe it is easy to get a false negative result due to misuse, but it is not easy to get a false positive result that is devastating for couples on ttc. You can be in the heaven at one moment, then fall to the hell at the next moment, you may think you had a miscarriage and keep asking what you did that deserve the punishment. Mental or emotional damage is not less worse than physical damage. Some people may never find out the truth and stay devastated about their loss or self-blaming. I am so sick of this product; and clearly the company doesn't have any moral by even selling them, not to mention the price."
1,Total dud!,"I am currently trying to get pregnant, bought this because I prefer the digital tests and ""get results sooner"" is obviously important for me. Have to say I'm very disappointed! I took all three tests: (1) 2 days before my period was due, got a pregnant result; (2) 1 day before period was due, got a NOT pregnant result; and (3) 1 day after period was due, got a pregnant result. All within 2hrs of the same time of day. What are the odds of getting two wrong pregnancy tests? I was so excited I was sharing the news with closest friends and family. Had a blood draw pregnancy test yesterday (4 days after period expected) and was stunned to find out I am not pregnant. I will NOT be buying these again."
1,Clear Blue should be ashamed to still be selling this,Bought this product and was over the moon to get a positive. Doctor did blood test and I am not pregnant. doctor says I am not the first to get a false positive with the digital test! I have done some research and clear blue only tested this on 400 women. I personally don't feel this is enough to justify calling it over 99% effective! Reviews speak for themselves - come on clear blue do something about it!
1,Devastated,"I used this test and was over the moon to see ""Pregnant"". As others have said, it was so exciting to be able to show it to my husband and not confuse him with lines he wouldn't understand. Unfortunately when I double-checked with other brands later, it turned out I was among those to receive a false positive.Seeing the word ""Pregnant"" made it seem so much more definitive, ""unmistakable"" just like the ads say. I wish I'd stuck with the traditional lines and allowed there to be an element of doubt. I completely got my hopes up, I thought it was really happening, I'm glad I only had a few hours of excitement before it was shattered. I understand about false negatives but I had no idea there was a likelihood of a false positive. I'll be sure to temper my excitement next time around."
1,I had a False Positive too!!!,"In late March, I was a day late and took a one of these pregnancy tests (the day before my husbands birthday)- which was possitive. The next day at work, I started bleeding. I've had one miscarriage (which happened to be on our annieverary- so special occassions haven't been the best luck for us) so it really freaked me out. I went to the doctor that afternoon and she said I was not having a miscarriage- that I was not pregnant to begin with!!Now, my period is 8 days late (very unusual) and I just took the second test in the package which says I'm not pregnant (which I don't know if I am or not- but needless to say, I can't trust the result anyway!)"
1,Never trust this product,"My wife and I though she would be pregnant, so she took this test and it came back with a clear ""pregnant"". We tried two other tests from a different brand that came back negative. We were both very confused so I decided to try one to see how accurate they were. To my surprise the test came back and said I was pregnant... Never trust this product as you can tell."
1,STAY AWAY!!,"I bought this because it said you could test up to 4 days early (I am 1 day early).I have used the older versions where the just give you pink or blue, one line or two or a + or - symbol with no problems. You don't even have to assemble those, with the digital you do.This one gave me a digital error code. Even though I bought 2 tests, they can only be used in the digital reader which the instructions say not to use again if there is an error code! GREAT! I can't call them either because they are only open 9-5 M-F.When I removed the test strip I noticed only 1 line, in older ClearBlue tests this meant NOT Pregnant, but from what I am reading here you can't even go by what the digital tell you!I wish I bought the cheap Wal-Mart brand, Equate, like I did last time! Worked fine. I even bought some from the $1 store that worked w/o a problem."
2,False positive a real bummer!!!,"I used Clear Blue Easy Digital when I found out that I was pregnant with my first child two years ago. It worked great and I was completely happy with the product. A few months ago, I bought and tested with the same brand and again it read ""Pregnant"". My husband and I were elated. Just to be sure, I tested again the next morning...and it read ""Not Pregnant."" I was confused because I've always heard that false positives are very rare, until I specifically searched on-line for this brand. To my surprise, it seems to be very common with the digital brands. I have a few left in the pack, but if I ever test again and get a ""Pregnant"" I will be sure to confirm it with another brand and at my doctor's office."
1,Horrible!!! Completely Inaccurate!!!,"My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant, this would have been the first day of my period so I took the test this morning and got a positive result - with the test reading: Pregnant. Well, then I started my period a few hours later after sharing the news that I was pregrant. Just returned from the doctor's office and found out I am not pregnant, despite the positive read from Clear Blue Easy. Still in disbelief, I took another test and sure enough it says positive too. What a waste of time and money and a tremendous disappointment. Thanks a lot, Clear Blue Easy, you suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,False Positive or very early miscarriage???,"I got a positive result yesterday, the day before I expected my period. This afternoon I got my period. I also used these tests for a previous pregnancy a got accurate results. Very early miscarriage of false positive?"
2,"False Positive again, I'm afraid...","My husband and I have been trying to conceive for three years, we've never had any children. I've taken tons of pregnancy test and for the first time ever, I got a ""Pregnant"" sign two nights ago. I was so elated I woke my husband up at 5am and cried tears of joy! I've wanted a baby so bad and it seems like all my prayers were answered. My husband said I should take a different test just to be sure, but since it was so early I waited a while and googled ""false positive"" just to find out how nearly impossible it was. When I took the second, third, fourth and so on they all said I was not pregnant. I am going to the doctor in an hour and then I will find out exactly how accurate this test is... but from reading these reviews, I already have a feeling :-( I will follow up when I get back and let anyone reading this know... I would much rather get 1000 negative test results then one false positive, I feel like my hearts been broken :'-("
1,False Positive,Ok I took this test last friday & it said I was pregnant. I called everyone I knew I was soo excited! Well then I took the other one in the box & it said not pregnant. So I went to my doctor today & found out that I am not pregnant. I am soo upset!!! I will NEVER buy this test again!
3,Nice but too feminine.,"It's a very good cologne with a fresh and very sophisticated scent. But I think it's too feminine, too tender for a male. To say it in other words, if you are an athletic and very masculine guy who wants to accentuate a tender part of himself little more than Pleasures could be very good solution. But if your goal is to exagerate your masculinity little more, and add more strength and adventurism to your personality than I think you should look for something else.. This one is too womanly."
5,Awesome card!!,"Simply put, this is an awesome card. I upgraded from two nvidia Albatron 6600GT cards running in SLI mode. If you don't already know, there are a few jumps between the 6600 GT and the 8800GTX. I can finally play Doom3 in the highest graphic mode - at full frame rate. IT'S AWESOME!!"
5,Awesome!,"This card simply does it right. Faster than a 7950 GX 2.It needs power, make sure all supply connections are made.Have Fun!"
5,Excellent for Games,I am using two of these in SLI and these cards can run new games really high detail without any drop in FPS. Excellent product from EVGA. Lots of overclocking potential.
5,A sleeping beauty - only comes around when aroused.,"There are two main requirements for the installation of this most impressive Graphics card,1.You must ensure your computer case is suitably large enough as this Card is nearly 11 inches in length and its width can swallow the space taken up by your standard card.2.Your power supply must be up to the job- a minimum of 550 whatts is the standard.This is my power supplywattage and i have experienced no problems.Your motherboard aswell as CPU must be of sufficint quality to justifie the purchase of such a card.If your CPU is less than say a Intel E6600 then you willnot reap the benifits of this beaty.If your computer is up to the task this is the DADDY to own."
