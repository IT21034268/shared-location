2,"Good Idea, Bad Implementation","When I first heard of this game I was impressed, a good idea. The ability to choose what ever vehicle you wanted, land sea and air etc. I was immediately fronted with long loading times. I decided to try the single player first and it was extremely slow and choppy game play so I tried out the multiplayer which where even longer loading times. I stuck with this game for a good several days thinking I could get used to its flaws but I just couldn't get past the buggy and choppy gameplay.The graphics are nothing to cheer about below Medal of Honor and Soldier of Fourtune II.The sound was ok.All in all not worth the money. Even with my system specs you still have to turn down the graphics to medium and even low to have decent gameplay and I can run Medal of Honor and SOF2 with high graphics on multiplayer and have it run smooth.System specs:Windows XP ProDSLPentium 4 2.0 gHz256 DDR RamGeForce 3 Ti200 128mb ramSound Blaster 5.1"
1,requirements,waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too mcuh requirements...cthe grpahics arent thaaaaat good. I give this a one i hope maybe theyll allow more people to be able to play
1,check your vedio card first,"To play this game, you ""MUST HAVE"" NVIDIA GeForce4, GeForce3, GeForce2, GeForce256, ATI Randeon 8500, Randeon 7500, Radeon, Matrox Pathelia. If you don't, don't try!"
1,Battlefield FLOP!!,"Bought the game the day it was released with eager anticipation given all the hipe. I'm a loyal fan of Meddle of Honor so I thought I couldn't go wrong given EA was behind the development. Big dissapoinment! Gameplay lagged, game detail looked rushed and unpolished, there was no sense of nostalgia that the Meddle of Honor series engendered and the campaigns were poorley conceived and developed.My advice: save your money and wait for the Meddle of Honor expansion due out in November. Battlefield 1942 is a big flop!!"
1,I ordered new,I ordered a new game so I could have the latest version but I got the first version which wont work with the mods I wanted it for. This is the last time I buy software from Amazon.
1,Worst single player imaginable!!!,"Simple, where i used to live i didn't have internet, DONT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE SINGLE PLAYER!!! The AI's are more stupid than my mom's dog, litteraly. I know i have a great machine. In a single player game the bots usually just sit in one spot and twitch! or they will pick you off from across the battle field. There is nothing to the single player game.It sucks!!!!"
1,A lot of trouble,"I had a LOT of trouble with this game and I have a pretty hefty gaming PC. It locks up my computer all the time and I cant even play it. I have downloaded the patch and I am still having trouble with it locking up and occasionally the sound will not even play. I have almost [$$$] in the game, the expansion pack, and the prima guide and it is just setting on my desk. I am an avid PC gamer and I have never had so much trouble with a game. I would advise anybody who is thinking about this game to go to the official Battlefield 1942 web site and check out the message board. You will see that i am not the only one with this problem."
3,"A good premise, bad execution","I will only give you the negative comments in this review. In Multiplayer, whether you join an FF server, you will be surrounded by people who have no clue how to do anything and of course the few TK'ers that ruin the fun. Lag is horrible, even with a ping of 35ms you would warp around frequently, and once you climb down a ladder on a moving ship you have a 1 out of 5 chance of warping out of the ship in to the ocean. Lag is horrible, I must stress this. Also, the weapons are uneven among different classes, and the poor accuracy combined with lag causes people to run around in circles shooting and reloading most of the time.This could all be fixed by some updates, but as of now those are the main problems in multi-player."
3,Not Like Medal of Honor,"If you're expecting a game similar to Medal of Honor (MOH), you're expecting too much! First of all, I had to get a new graphics card (had TNT & that didn't work) just to play the game! After it was installed & I was FINALLY able to play, I was a little disappointed. Driving the vehicles is fun (although I have not mastered the planes) but you don't have the one-on-one battles with soldiers like you do in MOH. Most of the battles are fought using tanks. The graphics are good, but I thought MOH was better. I'm looking forward to THAT upgrade soon!!"
5,BF1942 is a GREAT GAME!!,I have to say that Battlefield 1942 is a great game!!BYW- It does work on Win 2000 contrary to what it says here!
2,"OK, this isn't an honest review because.....","It locks up my machine 80% of the time.To start with after you install the game you have to jump through a bunch of hoops at File Planet etc. to get a patch.After all that I have to reboot 3 out of 4 times starting the game. Yes, I have the most recent video drivers and DirectX 8.1.Yes I meet the specs, Dual PIII's @ 1GHz, 851 Megs of RAMS, LVD SCSI drives and a Geforce4 TI4400 running Windows XP oughta do it!If you have to get an EA title get Medal of Honor! This feels like a work in progress(beta) and they have a long way to go!Don't spend 45 bucks on a beta version!"
2,Hope you have a killer pc,"This game, is great. Probably the best game to ever hit the shelves, BUT, hope you have a killer PC with lots of RAM, good graphics card and memory. This game will be very jerky and laggy even on low settings. Everything else on it is good, the weapons and the vechiles are amazing. Just hope you have a VERY good pc."
3,Mixed Feelings...,"Ok, don't get me wrong, I played this game at a friend's house and it is the single best army game now, and probably ever will be. However, the requirements are bigger than the Earth itself. My computer meets all the requirements except one... It requires a GeForce Video Card to play! So basically, I spent $ to get a horribly glitchy screen. My computer runs perfectly on high video settings for Star Wars: Jedi Outcast, but doesn't stand a chance even on low in Battlefield 1942. Before buying this game, make sure you have a GeForce Video Card, if not, get one, because this is a game you do not want to miss out on. I know I need to get myself one soon."
4,Just that! Keeping Love Alive,"This book can be used as a daily reader. You and your partner could use it for inspiration. It will give you guidance through your journey of love. I found it at a couples workshop in Cumberland Furnace, TN. My fiancee and I are using some of the tender readings at our wedding. This book will provide you with the hope that you always want in a relationship. Great tools to ""Keeping the Love Alive"""
3,Tangles,"I am not very imprested with this hose. Tangles on its self easily and is a ""bear"" to coil by hand. I prefer my old rubber hoses. It is very lightweight however. And has reinforced ends. I would have been better off with a 25 ft in the workshop rather than the 50 ft I bought"
3,Think about it,"I have this very hose, it is extremely light weight and stays very flexible but I will never buy another one. If you want a hose that becomes a knarled mess in your work space this one will do it. I have even soaked it in hot water trying to relax the memory in it but its useless, I cut mine down to 2-25ft sections that didnt make it any better. I would spend the extra, deal with the little bit extra in weight and stay with rubber."
5,Great hose made in USA,Buy it. You will never get another heavy hose again. Makes it a lot easier when on ladder or in confined spaces. Does not hang up as much and is very sturdy. Of course I would remove old nails etc from the floor to prevent possible damage. But this hose will not kink and break on you.
5,prefect hose for spray painting,"anyone have tried spray painting know that the difficult movement is the air hose in the way when you move the spray gun around paint job, and this is the prefect air hose and so flexible and light to use, most of the time I almost forget that I have a air hose attach to my tools, now I get rid of the other pvc hose and planning buying one more of this air hose."
1,PUR air hose,Threaded fitting snapped with very little pressure when I started to thread on the quick disconnect. Obviously defective. We needed the hose that day for a job we were on so we cut it and put in a hose barb with replacement threaded fitting. Unfortunately the strain relief was attached to the dfective factory installed fitting so now the hose probably won't last very long.
4,The CD of the cassette world,"Superb. It takes a few days to get used to the style of the hoses, but by no means it it a compromise. The only discussion I had to have with the hose is the re-usable fittings. The fittings work great, but they are a bit of a hassle to tighten the nuts together, the nuts are a bit skinnier than standard nuts and it takes a bit of finesse to tighten everything up, but other than that, I love it. I can customize my length, and I've finally found replacement fittings to use the existing hose I've cut up for more hose setups."
2,Intresting but not a major work,"Dr. Witherington is one of the rising stars in conservative theology today, and is an amazingly prolific writer (he seems to produce books as quickly as most pastors produce sermons). I guess because of that I expected more from this commentary. I simply did not find much new in this work. Most of Dr. Witherington's observations are what any astute layperson would arrive at on their own. If you are new to reading Mark then this book would probably be of some help in that it will introduce you to major themes and ideas. On the other hand, if you are moderately conversant with modern Markan scholarship, and you are looking for more insight, as well as a more detailed reading of the text, you would do better to look elsewhere. In particular I would suggest either Morna Hooker's superb ""The Gospel According to St. Mark"", or Ched Myer's challenging ""Binding the Strong Man, A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus"". Both offer much more serious scholarship and research."
2,An insult of a book! Put the tree back in the forest!,"Gross errors throughout this unfortunate book. Errors range from the innocuous and incorrect spellings to grammar mistakes to awkward and inappropriate translations. I may be a gringo, but I've spent enough time in the Spanish speaking world to know this guide will cause more confusion and frustration than it's worth. Caray! 'Evitalo como si fuera una enfermedad.'"
2,Understanding Islam requires understanding Christianity,"The biggest problem here is that Phipps does not discuss the Christian and Jewish sources of Muhammad's revelation. Muhammad thought he was a prophet in the Jewish sense and when the Jews of Arabia rejected him he decided to pretend he was more a follower of Abraham than were the Jews. It is clear here that both Islam and Christianity were attempts to steal the religion of the Jews and make them unbelievers despite their pretense of belief. This has great meaning today when Islam is the enemy of the Christian West and of Israel. Islam is a Judaeo-Christian heresy and not a religion in its own right.The Jews have suffered from Christians and Muslims for the same reason: they are made to be bad believers, yet Christians have in fact become polytheistic with their Trinity and Muslims have become Jew-haters and bible distorters."
1,Are you all serious?,"This book is incredibly dull and unerotic (and don't say it wasn't meant to be a sexy novel; just look at the cover and front page). The two lead characters, Wynne and Paula, have unbelievably charmed work lives and are supposed to be sophisticated business women. Yet they show the emotional maturity of 12 year olds. POTENTIAL SPOILER: Paula freaks out and won't forgive Wynne for having a one night stand with her while Wynne is still living with someone she doesn't love and is going to dump anyway. The road back to love is fraught with dull lesbian drama."
3,Star-crossed,"It was an okay read. I almost lost hope that the main characters would get together. It wasn't the best lesbian romance that I've read but it wasn't the worst either. It was an entertaining, quick novel to read."
3,Never Reached Greatness,"I found parts of MacGregor's ""Just This Once"" interesting, but the story seemed to hit a lull in several places. Wynne and Paula's meeting during Wynne's work related hotel stays, a hotel where Paula was employed, was good, but I couldn't find the enticement needed to make this a great romance story."
4,A well told story,"This is not a new story, but it is one told with style. One of the nice points is that MacGregor takes her time dealing with the issues between her characters. MacGregor gives her characters time to develop their relationship and then more time to deal with the problems that arise between them. They don't disagree one day and suddenly realize the next that they are soul mates meant to be together no matter what has happened between them. MacGregor also manages to make both characters human and people that a reader can relate to. Wynne has made some bad mistakes, but the reader will recognize how these occur in real life when people lose control of events in their lives. Paula's reactions are also perfectly understandable and ring true to experience. What this book demonstrates is a maturity of style and life. This isn't MacGregor's first novel and it shows that she is growing into her storytelling art. It's a pleasant read and a well told story."
2,Be honest people!,"I read so many reviews about this book and find they are overly exuberant at best. This is NOT one of Macgregor's best efforts. I am sorry I trusted these reviews and spent $9.99 on this weak story. I found myself very confused about which character she was writing about half the time. If you would like to read a well written novel by this author, I would recommend trying the Shaken series or the House on Sandstone. It would be nice to start seeing some honesty in these reviews when we as consumers are spending our hard earned money on these stories."
4,"Interesting, Informative, Trivia Book","This interesting trivia-style book discusses basic odds and chances written in an easy question-and-answer format. Subjects range all over the map, from liklihood of marital success and crime victimization, to turning gray by the time you are 50. There are questions about health problems, the workplace, attracting the opposite sex, length of athletic careers, etc. In short, interesting information attractively presented, though a few answers have changed over time since this book arrived in 1990. My brother read from these pages during a recent dinner, and we had fun chiming in with our guesses (sometimes debating the book's answers). This is a fun and readable look at many questions from everyday life."
5,Good Quality,The HP Color Inkjet paper is 24 lb. paper which is just a bit heavier and thicker than most copy paper. The heavier paper gives a more professional feel when used for business letters or anytime you want to make a good impression. The high brightness make images appear sharp and crisp. Text is also crisp with no evidence of bleeding. In myCanon PIXMA MG5220 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One (4502B017)the paper feeds well from both paper trays with no jamming. What more can you ask?Unlike the other reviewer my order arrived in just two days.
1,Damaged corners beware!!,Be leery about ordering any paper online due to the high probability that the corners will be damaged. I ordered two packages of paper and both had damaged corners which causes the printer to function incorrectly. I won't be ordering paper online any more.
3,buyer pay attention,"We understand times are tough, and companies are using every marketing tool to keep going, pay their employees continue operations. But consumers have to be in the look out as individuals and families are faighting for survival. Check for advertising tricks.I'm saying this because this pack of HP good paper seem to be a great purchase - as usual trough Amazon - but you may overlook the hidden reason of the price, it contain oddly enough 400 sheets instead of 500... Same wrapping same photo of the ballon, same colors and layout, but one fifth less amount of product.They may have study this technique from modern bread bakers, less bread in same bag, same price.Watch out for smaller cans, bottles, and bags foks.Braulio"
5,My Canon Printer Loves It!,"This is my go to paper for everything. Yes, it is a heavier stock but it keeps my Canon Printer happy and turns out a beautiful bright white printed copy. I can't stand cheap gray tinted or yellow tinted printer paper. I've yet to have a paper jam using this particular paper. My printer instruction booklet recommended a heavier stock and this fits the bill perfectly. I highly recommend!"
4,Good paper,"I buy HP paper for my HP printers when the price is sensible. I like the brightness, and the heaver weight of the paper makes double-sided printing work well. Ordering from Amazon is easy, saves carrying home the heavy paper and avoids the sales tax. Amazon's great service and quick prime shipping makes this an easy decision."
4,Solid ink jet paper,"- Bright, sturdy printer paper- I use it on an HP photosmart printer with good results (for photo prints I use photo paper, but for everything else, this is solid)- Costs a little more money because its higher quality paper, but to me it's worth a couple dollars extra over the super cheap stuff you might find in a large store- I tried one package to see if it was worth it, and just ordered a second package.- Amazon delivered quickly."
5,JACO IS LOOK'N DOWN AND SMILE'N...,"JAZZ FUSION IS ALIVE AND WELL... THE CAB SERIES IS DEFINATLY WHERE IT'S AT. THE COMPANY IS SLAM'N..!!!! FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR CAB3...IT MAY BE IN PRODUCTION SOON. THE GANG IS LOOK'N TO PUT OUT A POSSIBLE LIVE PRODUCTION. MAYBE A LITTLE OF CAB1 AND 2. LET'S HOPE SO...KEEP IT COMING GUYS, WE NEED MORE."
1,Totally unacceptable!,"Reflections of my life(6th, as printed) not found in the whole album. The sole purpose of this purchase is for the song. It was not there. Besides the cd alledgely contains 18 songs but it actually contains only 13. I don't know how to rate this. I think it's totally unacceptable. I'll not buy again."
1,Not worth the money,Too expensive and long time problem with my table - customer service & sales could not help fix problem. Was given the run a round by sales dept countless times. Table could be nice if it was more stable.
1,"Table nice, arm rest and sales process is not.","The table is nice. Like the size, heat, portability. The arm rest is designed poorly as it makes Velcro noise and tilts as one arm is removed thus disturbing the client. You will end up not using it. The vendor and company and Amazon really disappointed me in the sales process. The CD's were not shipped with the order. How hard can it be to just send me some CD's? They are ""investigating"". Sound like a scam. If you want one of these table, expect to be happy with the table, disappointed in the sales process and the arm rest. Good luck."
5,Cured meat at its finiest,"Great stuff. You take your first bite of the jerky and chew. The full impact of the taste doesn't hit you right away and for the first few seconds it's like ""wtf this meat is flavorless."" You continue to chew in shock and disbelief. But then -- Then you slowly start to sit down as the saliva in your mouth starts to extract the flavor from the product and it begins to dance on your palette playing out an intricate scene involving a ninja and a ballerina, both elegant in their own respect, but the ninja, the spicy side, will not hesitate to kick some ass as well because he's a ninja for lord's sake.Anyway, if you like beef jerky at all I would definitely recommend you purchase this fine product."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book after watching a program on Food Network about Super Suppers. The founder of the company is also the author of this book. Since there are not any stores near my home I thought I might still be able to make some of the food I saw on TV. The book was smaller than I thought, and the recipes were very basic; there were even duplicates. It seemed like a children's cookbook, and I was very disappointed."
1,Awful,This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It meanders everywhere but really goes nowhere. Do yourself a favor and read some Terry Pratchett or some Piers Anthony or absolutely anything else instead of this.
3,great harmony music from the forties!,"of course, this isn't the black Clark Sisters!!!! Just because this isn't what you're looking for doesn't mean that it's bad swing 40's music! it is actually good 40's vocal harmony music! OPEN YOUR MIND TO All types of music. Don't be ignorant of other music genres! Expand your mind!"
2,A good second choice,"All well known Swing Standards but not as creative as their Sing Sing Sing album,. Still, a good second choice if you love the original Clarke Sisters"
4,..,"The United States possesses both the world's largest national economy and its strongest military forces. Those two aspects are mutually reinforcing, entwined and reliant upon cyber-based systems. These systems are used to manage our nation's critical infrastructures and are always at risk to illegal penetration and sabotage and must be securely maintained. Baklarz and Forno have taken a critical and unique approach to ascertaining the risks to our cyber-systems both inside and outside our government and to presenting methodologies that can be implemented to minimize those risks. A book that is not to be missed!"""
4,The Ancient terminology in a modern Time.,"After reading the book I had a whole new perspective for info sec and really gained from the experience. I felt that some of the theory in the book was dated but for the novice to intermediate it is a ""ART OF WAR"" must have for the practice."
3,Interesting!,"The Art of Informatin Warfare was a good read on information warfare and computer security topics. It was easy to follow, humorous (at times) and is something that I (a ""newbie"") could follow. The examples in the back were very helpful in testing some security items at the office."
3,This cd player does not play mp3s!,"When I purchased this item I was looking for a cd player that would play mp3s. This is a great cd player; however, it does not play mp3s or wmas as the description said. I was able to return the product for a refund, and the whole thing was handled professionally and promptly. I just don't want anyone else to make the same mistake."
3,disappointed,I wish they had mentioned in the info that the headphones are the silly ones that hook over your ears.....bought it for a child and I would have chosen differently.
3,Hong Kong before China turnover,"While the book gave me a great history of the former British Colony it was written before the turnover to China. Great review of the power-brokers of Hong Kong, however it left me with a desire to know more about what has transpired since 1997. I suppose the rating I gave Jan Morris' book was due simple to this fact. I hope someone extends on what she has written and bring those of us interested up to date on the new role Hong Kong has in the world and China's dealing with this financial center of the world. It saddens me to think that in 2047 China will probably have destroyed the ambiance of this wonderful city. However, I will not be against Hong Kong people. Going fast now is the Cantonese language that is being replace with Mandarin."
1,Why was this published?,I think this could have been a pamphlet. It tells us what we learned about exercise and body type in elementary school. I give it 1 star for enthusiasm.
3,There is nothing wrong with the sound quality of this CD,"This Cd re-issue of Keely Smith's 1959 Because Your Mine isn't as bad as Be My Love from the 60's, but it isn't nearly as good as her jazzier sessions with Billy May and Nelson Riddle. The music is sometimes swinging and crosses into middle of the road pop, however I would'nt say it was bad. Keely's voice is beautiful, and turns the middle of the road pop tunes into standards, and the muzaky orchestra is bearable, and not dated sounding. If you're alrady a Keely Smith fan buy it, if you're new try Cherokeely Swings with Billy May's arrangements, and try her recordings with Nelson Riddle too."
4,Romantic Keely,"If you like Keely, which I do, you'll like this CD, particularly if you want to hear her romantic side. I had not read the listing of numbers closely enough as I was wanting more of the Jazz/swing Keely, which this isn't. None-the-less,it's a classy CD!"
5,progressive cornerstone,"The ETERNITY X albums surely deserves greater attention than most of the new Progressive heavy-metal bands, in a recently quite crowded genre (Both quantitatively and qualitatively). Each of them present a subtle blend of symphonic elements, powerful keyboards and very well put together songs. I would probably go as far as saying that this CD propely earns its huge reputation of being a cutting egde state of the art example of progressive metal .For anyone into prog metal this cd is a progressive cornerstone."
4,No middle ground here.,"You are either going to love this movie or despise it. I really enjoyed it, but it's not for everyone. I'll spare you the plot summary since Amazon already has it, but I will tell you that words cannot describe this movie. The grindhouse influence on this movie makes Tarantino and Rodriguez's effort look like a mainstream blockbuster. This movie is basically a mind-trip through 70's kung-fu, sexploitation, and gore flicks with a modern-day headline thrown in to pull it all together. It's almost like Cronenberg decided to film an artsy homage to the grindhouse era. Sarah Lassez is a super talented actress (not to mention that she's SMOKING hot). If you're into trippy movies like Requiem for a Dream or Donnie Darko and you liked 70's grindhouse films, this is for you. However, the mainstream movie or horror viewer will likely hate this."
3,weird,I've rated this movie at 3 stars but this is only because it features Sarah Lassez. She's beautiful and talented. As to the movie itself I've no clue what it is about. The menu has as a background a blood spilled Sarah Lassez and a piece of bloody meat. I guess this sums it up.My main gripe with this DVD is that picture quality could have been a lot better. It's not really bad but the picture suffers from bad scaling artefacts. This probably could have been easily avoided. The deleted scenes are non anamorphic and they do not have this problem.
3,uh yeah,she is a great actor however this movie doesn't really make sense also could of been a lot shorter... they longer this movie went on the less and less sense it made however sarah Lassez is hot
3,Start of the series is not the best,"Once you go on and read several others--and I urge you to read them in order, starting with this one--you may well agree with me that the first is unquestionably the weakest of a good series. It is hardly a bad book, but it lacks the force and focus that the later ones bring. It is as if the author were feeling his way forward with the character and the plot line, chapter by chapter.This is a good series, however, and the first book is essential to it. Like others, I would rank it third in the Forester/O'Brian list...but that's good company!"
3,GREAT SONG SELECTION; PRODUCTION IS DULL,"Reeves voice is incomparable and the song selections are great! The production values are dull. Reeves recorded at a time during the sixties when arrangements were lush with strings, which I love. For those who love simple arrangements, this is the CD for you as Reeves voice is the primary attraction. If you want a voice complemented by sophisticated production (aka the sixties sound) you will be disappointed. The songs are great, Reeves is great, the production not so great!"
1,Not impressed,"Being a Professional Surveyor I expected this to make my life a bit easier. However, even taking readings from the same spot I usually got wildly different answers for example, 2.5 metres against 7.4 metres. We are NOT talking of slight differences here !! For me, it is completely useless as all measurements need to be double checked with a tape. That rather defeats the object of having it. Sometimes, it reads OK, probably random though. Basically I ended up taking twice as long to do the same job as a tape. Anybody want to buy one...going cheap ;-)"
1,Don't waste your money,Unreliable when used on drywall. Can not trust any measurements unless perfect surface (hard and shiny) is target. No visible beam to help aim.
5,It's the BEST!,I have had this notebook for a month now and it's everything that's promised. The only problem that I had was the pointing device would go on its own but that problem was easily solved. On the bottom right there is a little box which you have to click off and then the pointer works normally. I love the 17 inch screen and the Windows Vista premium is excellent!
1,Need new screen after 18 months,"I bought this laptop believing that Toshiba would stand by its product. Six months after the one year warranty expired, the screen began to form thin lines. Toshiba said it wanted $450 to send in the computer and another $250 to replace the screen. I will never buy another Toshiba product and suggest you don't either."
3,"Éxcellent Product, but............","is fast, slim, the win vista wow is excellent, but only bad is not have the fingerprint Reader!"
3,Just Standard,"It's not bad, but I like Staple's kind better. Closes easier. It's o.k, and it arrived without any problem - no broken ones."
5,Great!,"These work as expected. They are perfect DVD cases, and worked out great when I helped produce DVDs for a fellow film student's short film. The DVDs fit nice and snugly inside, and were easy to get back out. Also, the covers fit nicely inside, and weren't too loose at all.The DVDs did have a bit of an odor to them when I first got them, but it wasn't very strong, and wasn't really a problem. All new things have a ""new thing smell"" and it was to be expected. Not anything I worried over, and over time the smell has diminished."
3,"Decent, not great.",These are decent but do not compare to the cases you get when you buy a professional DVD. The case itself seems flimsy but it might just be my imagination. The plastic film on the outside is loose and flimsy as well as not put on properly on a few cases. The push-release button locks the disc in place fine but doesn't release it too easily. You end up having to pry it off anyway so the push-release is redundant. Also seems like it will break after awhile.Decent for home use but I would not recommend these if you're trying to use them in a professional setting.
4,Good to have on hand,I bought these for single discs of favorite movies. Plastic sleeve allows for printed matter. Push-button keeps discs securely in place. Good deal.
3,Not bad for the price but could've been SLIGHTLY better.,"I had bought these as replacement cases since I grab used games often and happen to stumble on a few copies where it looks like the previous owner took a good hacking to it. So if anyone is like me I like to do what I can to make any little bit of it seem good as new. Hey it makes me feel better what can I say?For a 10 Pack the price isn't that bad really, my only criticism on the product is when placing the disks inside it took a little more than necessary effort to make sure they stayed in. Also the clear slip for your labels seems shockingly fragile. I had one case easily rip just by putting it down and stacking others ontop of it.In the end I just had to remember these are replacements and would never be as great as the original case that got damaged. It was just a pity though because Memorex always seemed like an okay brand."
5,Just what I needed,"These cases were exactly what I was looking for: someplace to store my homemade DVDs and ""backup copies"" of other DVDs. The clear plastic sleeve is nice so you can easily add artwork. When mixed in with my other DVD cases on the shelf, I can't tell the difference. Great cases and a great price."
1,Do not buy this case,"I just bought a 10 pack of these and although many reviews had varying results, I personally recommend against buying this item. The little plastic dvd locking thing that holds the dvd in place inside of the case is so cheap that it's pretty difficult to pull the dvd out. Every time that I use this case, I worry that I might damage my disc or break the plastic button that holds it in the case. Very frustrating product to work with."
2,Super flimsy product,"I guess they do indeed hold discs. But that is where their utility ends. They are VERY flimsy and are difficult to snap shut because the two sides don't really match up well on any of the cases. Also, the side that opens is all scuffed up and peeled back (probably from handling and storage), but is like that on all of the packs I bought. I'm considering buying them as they are just shoddy and pretty much useless."
5,DVD Storage Cases,I found them to be adequate. I saw some had called them flimsy. I took out some movies and compared the cases. yeah its a boring evening. Well some of the commercial cases were very strong and some were just like these. I just bought them to replace the factory cases that come with broken plastic tabs that hold the movie in. So they worked for me. They snapped shut and opened fine for me as well. I gave them 5 stars because I could not find any faults with them. They are DVD cases...
4,"Great item, weird smell","This item is perfect for housing movies and software that need to stay safe, however, and this is just nit picky (and weird), but it has a weird barbecue smell... The smell is really potent and I had to spray it down with a deodorant spray just to be able to stand it. That could be just an isolated incident, but I believe it is the plastic. Other then that it is great! It is a lot better then the slim cases which is all anyone ever sells anymore, so I was happy to find them!"
4,Acceptable for the price but one big flaw...,"The hub for the cases I got sucks. It holds the discs in REALLY well but the part that looks like a push-release isn't connected to the clips that hold the disc so pushing the hub doesn't do anything. Instead, the disc has to be pried out. I've read really mixed reviews on these, though, so I'm not even sure they're sending out the same cases in every order. Mine don't have a weird smell, the plastic is sturdy and the plastic film for the cover is perfectly fine unlike some of the negative reviews I read. Actually, these would be perfect if the hub wasn't useless. Still, holding the disc in too well is better than not holding it well enough."
5,Memorex 32021980 DVD Storage Cases 10 Pack,"Have bought several packages of these because I prefer my DVDs to look the same. I don't like the kind that have cardboard covers, or just didn't want to hassle with covers that have a lot of stickers that are hard to remove."
4,Good cases,"These cases are similar quality to what you find on DVD's you purchase at the store. The clear film on the outside is slightly thinner, as is the black plastic the case is made of. However, overall, for the price, they are good cases and I'd recommend them to friends and family looking for cheap DVD cases like I was."
4,Good,"What was so good about Wes??? Wow he played a 7- string, big whoop. He usually played the same riff over and over and he never played any solos. This new guitarist, Mike, plays solos in Underneath The Gun, and other good riffs. The riffs aren't constantly repeated anymore. The tunes are just as good too. Theres still some immature Bizkit (Eat You Alive, Gimme The Mic, Phenomenon), but theres also some slower Bizkit, and of course what would a Bizkit album be without an all rap track (Red Light, Green Light) this CD rocks. I can't beleieve Blender said Limp Bizkit was worst band of the year. They rule, and so does Good Charlotte (who Blender said was 2nd worst)."
2,It's Over Fred,"The latest Limp Bizkit CD proves what I have known all along...Les was the key component in the band's earlier success. Lil' Fred loves playing ""rock star"" but lacks the necessary talent to parade around like a small man's Hugh Hefner. The album has a few descent tracks, but overall, it is lacking in lyrical and artistic vision. I think all amazon customers could do better elsewhere."
1,ONLY 1 PROMBLEM...ITS SUCKS,thers only 1 probblem with the awful cd and that problem is that is compltetly sucks-this band is by far the worst band ever to come out.FRED I HOPE U READ THIS! CUZ U SUCK!
3,pretty good but.......,"GOOD LORD!!! it gets kinda annoying when he says ""baby"" about 500 times in just one song. i guess he just discovered this word. other than that it does have some high points. Eat You Alive is an awesome song and features the best line ever ""No doubt that i'd love to sniff on them panties now."" that is just awesome. Eat You Alive, being such a pathetic loser myself, kinda feels like my personal anthem and could be for some other losers like myself. just watching someone and never actually talking to them. anyways, i kinda trailed off. i recommend not to buy it but just to dl it and burn it."
1,BORING,"This album is horrible! It's so boring and lame. Only good song is ""Eat you Alive"". The rest just sucks! It's nothing but sappy love songs. All the energy this band had left when Wes did."
1,Limp Bizkit has gone Limp!,"Wow, what can I say beside F the RIAA. This Album sucks. Eat you alive is decent but my god does the rest of the Album make me wanna burn the CD. I thought they coould make up for chocolate letdown but I guess not. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Wes-less Limp Bizkit like LeBron-less Cavaliers.,"""Eat You Alive"" gave me false hope that this could be an alright album after the departure of Wes Borland. I was wrong. There is very little to like about this. The guitar riffs are weak and don't stick. There is an overall lack of cohesiveness. Wes was the glue that held this weak band together, and without him, they would have sucked and do suck now without him. Check out the songs online and download ones you like, but don't just buy this album in it's entirety. You're bound to be disappointed."
1,My review.......,"Yo, I see Fred Durst screaming out ""I'M WHIIIIIIIIIIIIITE!!!!!!"" on the cover and he looks like a jack @$$. No more white rappers!!!!!!!!! Please!!!!!!! Paul Wall I guess I can deal with but he's the only one!---------G.D. signing off"
1,"Stop MTV, and the artists who are UNDER IT!","I mean, this new album by Limp Bizkit is just MTV's way of trashload music. Start a petition to get rid of MTV and its artists and to cause the apocalypse on those stupid niggas!"
1,Results are Horrible,"Limp Bizkit is easily one of the worst bands in music today. Their cover of Behind Blue Eyes is disgraceful. First, they took out the 'heavy' part and lyrics and replaced it with that L.I.M.P. Discover crap. Then they add that ridiculous last verse with new lyrics that in no way fit in with the theme of the song. I understand trying to add your own spin to a cover and not just playing it 'by the numbers' but this song is a complete slap in the face to the Who. To top things off, they didn't even spell Pete's name right in the credits. It's TownsHend, not Townsend. Rumour has it that the band only picked the song because they wanted to cover an old hit and it was the easiest one to cover out of a list of potential songs. In conclusion, WORST BAND EVER. Listen to real music."
1,Results May Suck,"I could talk about how bad this album is and how much Limp Bizkit sucks, but it seems dozens of people have already made their point across pretty nicely. Instead, I have a comparison to make of everyone's most hated front-man. You know who Fred Durst reminds me of? A 21st century version of Vanilla Ice. Like Vanilla, Fred tries so hard to have a ""thug"" image that he ends up being a parody of himself. Also, like Vanilla, he can't rap for his life (or sing for that matter). And lastly, Fred has made the worst music today since, you guessed it, Vanilla Ice. Come to think of it, have you ever seen both Fred Durst and Vanilla Ice in the same area at the same time? Hmmmmm.. I think I smell a conspiracy! No wait, that was the smell of crap coming from the radio playing a Limp Bizkit song."
1,uhhh dude like this cd blows---,this cd is realm bad heres what i think of this band SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSSUCKS SUCKS SUSUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKSCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS uhhh dude this cd sucks and so does this sucky band!!
2,An Honest Opinion,"ok, let me be real clear about this, my HONEST opinion of this album was that it sucked. i know everyone else is saying the exact same thing so it makes me sound like a conformist ass-hole when i say ""results may vary"" was a s****y album, but its true. The bottom line is i used to like limp bizkit, (before i had any knowledge of what real music was) but now i really, truely don't. Unlike most people who have not even listened to this album, i have, and because of that i can give an honest opinion....it wasn't very good."
1,Hey now ppl dont be hating KILL DURST,"ne way, y'll have seen my other review for this. but i am just telling the public, that we should sew durst for being with sheman britney spears. umm srry, lets change there name to WIMP BISCUT ya biscut is spelled rite. so this is what i propose to WIMP BISCUT. i say this to them . yll suck and ur and ur sellouts who want money and give single teasers for the albulm. so go kill urself"
1,"fred durst is a lame ""artist""","don't waste money, or even waste time downloading it and listening to it, eat you alive is the only half-a** decent song to be on this usless piece of junk(not even good for toilet paper). fred said he got picked on in school, boo freakin hoo, he proably cried like a little school girl after screaming like one when he got beat up for being a dumba**. nuff said."
4,This is What I Call E-V-O-L-U-T-I-O-N!!!,"FOR ALL YOU GUYS WHO GIVE THE ALBUM ONE STAR, YOU DONT REALLY KNOW WHAT TRUE MUSIC IS ABOUT. EVERY BAND HAS TO CHANGE SOMEDAY, FOR ALL YOU LB FANS WHO LOVED THE OTHER 3 ALBUMS. SOME EXAMPLES OF BANDS WHO CHANGED THEIR TYPE OF MUSIC ARE METALLICA, LINKIN PARK, AND KORN. I KNOW YOU MAYBE WONT LIKE THIS ALBUM FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT GIVE IT A TRY. MR. FRED DURST IS A LOT SINCERE AND UNDERSTANDABLE IN HIS LYRICS THAN IN PAST YEARS. ALSO, THE ROCK SONGS ARE MORE THAN THE RAP ONE, WHICH SHOWS A HIGHER GRADE OF MATURITY. EVEN WITHOUT WES IN THE BAND, I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE GUITARS IN THIS ALBUM ARE AMAZING. MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE ""BEHIND BLUE EYES"", ""BUILD A BRIDGE"", ""EAT YOU ALIVE"", AND ""GIMME THE MIC"". IF YOU ARE A TRUE LB FAN, PLEASE BUY THIS ALBUM...- AGUANTE LA ANARQUIA SAS 07!!!"
4,all who hate can eat..well you know,"I DONT GET HOW JUST TWO YEARS AGO, EVERY MAN OUT THERE WAS SPORTIN BACKWARD CAPS AND WANNABE GOATTEES, AND NOW THEY ARE ALL ""ACTIN"" LIKE LIMP SUCKS. I HAVE AN IDEA, STOP THINKING THE WAY MTV, YOUR THINK THEY'RE COOL FRIENDS, OR ANYONE ELSE THINKS, GROW A SET, AND REALIZE THAT LIMP IS STILL ONE BAD ASS BAND. SURE THERE ARE A FEW SONGS ON HERE THAT EVEN I DONT LIKE, BUT I AINT JUMPING SHIP, THESE BOYS CAN ROCK, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. OTHER THAN THAT, JUST KEEP ON KEEPIN ON. LOVE YA'LL, I'M OUT."
2,"No Good , Not at all what they used to be ..","First cd i heard i was like ''ok this can be good'' , then came the second and i was annoyed at the singers lyrics which seemed like a [...] wrote them ... first cd was also immature but i was young at the time so yeh.. now 22 and this band is a joke . great for 1 hit singles but crappy cd's and poor lyrics . no energy and no creativity ... check out these bands/cd's if you want something better ....Band Cd---- ----Reveille - Bleed the SkyLinkin Park - Hybrid TheoryTaproot - Gift"
1,limp bizkit results may vary,limp bizkit is the worst band in the history of music. i would give this record zero stars if i could and i never even heard it. i cant believe this is what kids listen to these days god help us.
1,This is just horrible..,"Please Fred quit now...You're first couple of albums had some catchy songs and I liked them..but now you are sooooo boring...bland riffs, horrible lyrics and ""rhyming""...please stop rapping...I guess Wes looks pretty smart about now...He WAS the only interesting guy in your group anyways"
1,How?/Why?,"How? How does something so horrible ever get produced? And why do some people like this sh*t? Seriously, this might be the sh*tiest album i've ever been forced to listen to. I am amazed at how pure crap such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, Staind, and Slipknot ever got so popular. Those aren't the only ones, but they are the ones i detest most. I understand some people listen to these noise polluters when they are ""angry"" or need to be ""pumped up"" might i suggest Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, or Audioslave for the anger management, and possibly some GNR,early Aerosmith, or Van Halen(with David Lee Roth) for the energy kick. BUT PLEASE stay away from ""Results May Vary"" for your own protection."
1,Fred Durst the most talented frontman in rock music??,"I saw someone said that (read the title). No offence, '85 Delorean' but if you thing that Fred is the most talented frontman your'e seriously missing out. I realize that you don't listen to (good) rock music from the 60's, 70's, 80's (Not this Bon Jovi Crap and etc.) and the early 90's, 'cause if you do you would find out that 'Behind Blue Eyes' made by The Who, and Fred Burst STOLE their version. Limp Bizkit is one of the worst (if not the worst) bands ever puked to the world, their songs suck, their players suck and Fred as well. Do yourself a favour, go get something by Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Metallica's 5 first albums (the others stink as Limp Bizkit), Black Sabbath, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Guns N Roses, Queen, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix etc. etc. etc..... I bet you that you won't think anymore that Fred Burst is the most talented frontman."
1,Buy all Limp Bizkit Cd's! But RUN from this one!,"Limp Bizkit use to be my favorite band untill they put out this load of crap! You can buy it to laugh at if you like! All of their ohter cd's are the best cd's you will ever here!!! Except this one blows. The first 2 songs are decent like B-, but then the rest of the cd is boring, slow, and repeats alot. Gives me a headach, I bought it and listened to it alot trying to get into it with no luck.....Why FRED??? WHY??????Thanks for reading me!"
5,"Im limping with the bizkit, beby","Limp bizkit is the ultimate band and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fag. pop is poison, full rap is full crap, hip-hop i think not. Limps only bad song is that ""if i could touch your body"" crap. Everything else is totally awesome music. Bless the Bizkit."
2,Limping Bizkit,"Im sorry to say, but this cd is barely listenable if your a limp fan. There are about 2 pretty good songs on this cd, and the only reason they stand out is becuase they are the only songs that sound like the old limp bizkit. This new mainstream hard rock [stuff] is a pitiful, limp bizkit was good becuase they had their own style. If you seriously compare the last 2 cds to this cd, you cannot say ""Results may vary"" is at all in the least bit good. Do not get me wrong, i love Limp Bizkit but the Result dont vary, this cd [stinks]. The other reviews on this site are disillusioned. In the hope that maybe if they listen to the cd enough, they will like it. Dont waste your money, and dont even waste your time downloading it. You will be greatly dissapointed, i know i was."
3,Not as bad as people are saying,"I personally dont like limp bizkit (there best album was there first), but my friend got this album and i listened to it. It is not as bad as people are saying, its no classic by any means but its not bad. People do have a point that the lyrics are kinda corny and not very deep, but have they ever been. If your not a fan of the band, then why are you reading this and showing interest. If you do like the band, then you will like this cd, its not that bad (for limp bizkit)."
4,not the best but it'll do,"to start things off, i will admit that for being a Limp Bizkit fan, this is not their greatest work ever, but what is really starting to annoy me are these anti-limp bizkit fans. first off if you are not a fan to begin with, then don't bother listening to their music and try to discourage other people from buying what you already think is a waste of time. second if u never liked any of their other cd's then why are u wasting your your time and money buying this one and then saying how crappy it is. i think some of you people should learn when to open your mouths cuz thier better off being kept shut."
1,dont do it!!!,"dont even take the time too listen to this crap, this is the worst band ive ever heard, and the cover of the album its mediocre,just like the music. and the vocals, please do yourself a favor and dont buy this cd."
4,Music Fan,"I actually think that this CD is pretty good. Don't get me wrong, like all CDs it has some song that sux, but over all it was exellent. I especially like ""eat u alive"" :)"
2,I can't believe this is happening,"You know, I would be the last person to trash Limp Bizkit. Ever since I got hooked onto ""Nookie,"" I've been a fan. And, for a long time, I've been defending their worsening ways. Most of my friends hate LB. But I stood my ground. Fred, I have no idea whats going on, but do something quick. This album is less than mediocre. With an exception of a few songs, there wasn't much to this CD. Whatever happened to agressive rock? Why so many slow, lame songs? I heard it before I bought it, so I knew that it was crap, but bought it anyway because I am a fan. You guys really have to step it up; I can't hold off these anti-Bizkit people any longer."
4,limp bizkit has never sounded better,i know most of you people here are great fans of hard rock with people that scream and shout for no reason but to annoy us and make us angry but some people would prefer 'softer' aproatch one of the best song i heard last year was there cover of the Who's 'behind Blue Eyes' at that point i knew i needed to get this album then i was amazed to find one of the best songs i have ever heard 'Down Another Day' along with this 'lonely world'and 'build a bridge' stood out to me to make this the best album i own and i own alot of albums.
4,"This is limp's ""grown up"" CD","For those of you that prefer when a band doesn't mature or expand musically, like Metallica or Radiohead or Manson, you'll probably hate this CD. It's not nearly as predictable as their last two albums, and is infinitaly better than Significant Other. It's still limp, but it sounds like they've taken the best hip hop and rock that they do and left out the filler garbage that their last two albums were laced with. This album sounds like Durst is trying to get away from just trying to sell music to the mainstream and is actually making music for himself as an artist."
3,not that bad,i am not a big fan of limp infact other then this cd i like maybe 3 songs one of which wasnt even theirs. but this cd actully is salvageable and i think it was a great decision on the bands behalf to remake blue eyes great song and if they cut out the discover l.i.m.p part i would like it more then the originale. eat you alive is a good hard rock song some one earlyer made me laugh by saying heavy metal you obviouly dont know music there is nothing heavy metal about this band.
1,why is this crap still around,"PLAY THE BEATLESPLAY STEELY DANPLAY LED ZEPPELINPLAY AC/DCPLAY SYSTEM OF A DOWNbut definatly do not play this crap...ha this is stupid.I can,t even decide if Fred durst is black and white. HA"
2,what the hell,"ok so i've known about limp bizkit since they first came out with three dollar bill y'all in 97 and i loved that cd when it came out. ever since then they've just been stupid with what they've done. they have the worst lyrics possible and i understand why wes left. Fred can't rap (...) and he needs to stop trying because it's really annoying. a great CD is korn's first CD it's their best and even they went thru their changes but they're still good. you might also wanna try the deftones first and second CD's b/c they are some great CD's. bottom line is limp bizkit is ok for a few songs here and there, their first CD is the best all around besides that just get the good songs off your friends and don't waste the money on the CD's."
2,I have to agree with the majority,"Its terrible, in most aspects. There are three good songs, the rest just suck.Eat you aliveBuild a BridgeBehind blue eyesThose are the only good songs. Limp Bizkit is the biggest example of how alot of bands start out good and just get progressively worse, never rising back up again. 3 Dollar bill ya'll was awesome, Significant Other was great, Hot Dog was ""eh"" and the new one is just bad."
3,Its Limping Piece of Sh@t!,"F##k fred and his retard Mike Smith. Cant sing and play for nuts. i used to like the album but now hell it sucks WAY BIG TIME. why i gave this crap 3 stars?? Well firstly at least Fred tried to be better by writing some almost decent lyrics. Well at least he tried. Man i had to dig out Significant other and three dollar bill to hear good old limp sh#t. This album is too soft and too corny. It is like as if Fred wants to be part of a boyband. man tell that coward piece of crap to F.O. and get a life. I dont think that the so called meaningful lyrics are as sincere as Korn's lyrics. and besides he is moaning his ass off way too much. Please, Fred. You cant pull it off like Korn. One thing that Korn does so well is to express hate and depression very well. As for Limp Bizkit, too bad. they are not even a fraction of Korn's talents. the only good thing abt LB is the drummer. Other than that, since wes left, LB has become Lousy B#tch. Better luck next time."
1,LIMP BIZKIT SUCKS D*CK,If you want real talent and some heavy metal check out Black Label Society not this disgrace to genre.
1,Pure Garbage!!!,"Hopeless mindless slop- do your ears a favor and go buy a beatles,led zepp or pink floyd cd -those bands had talent!"
1,For all of you who have read how long my other reviews are..,"I'm going to make this real quick: I hate Limp Bizkit, they suck, they always have sucked, Fred Duuuurrrst is so bad one of Jerry's kids came up with his lyrics, and I just wanna give a congratulatory nod to Fred Durst's Numba One Fan for being the biggest joker on this website! When I read your review on Led Zeppelin IV, I laughed so hard I crept my pants! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!Before I forget, nobody insult 'phycho!' His reviews are so phychotic that I hid in the closet for a week, so don't make him mad. ok, it your life."
1,The same stuff,"Every song on this album sounds exactly the same as all of the others, except the lyrics are different. Just like all of their other albums. The only good song on this album is ""Behind Blue Eyes"", which was originally written by ""The Who"". And trust me, they sound much better playing it than Limp Bizkit."
1,ANOYING! LOST THE TOUCH!,"This album is so anoying!, so wrong don't buy it!, the only good thing about it, it's that they already are bringin' down the price of full cd's way too go!"
1,Pathetic,"Limp Bizkit is one of the worse bands in history. The guitar work sucks. The drum work sucks and of course, Fred Durst sucks. Get good Metal, good Rock, Jazz or Classical Music instead of this junk."
1,"No, they really don't vary at all.","Is there anyone else on the planet right now less cool than Fred Durst? I mean, all of a sudden he's bragging about who he's been sleeping with, who he wishes he was with (his pathetic Wayne's World come ons to Halle Berry), and whining about the pratfalls of being a famous person. On a Philly radio station, he unleashed a string of obscenities at the interviewer after said DJ asked about the less than overwhelming acceptance of ""Results."" (""There will be the smart people who will appreciate me and c-s-kers like you that won't.) Well, stop worrying Fred, you'll be hanging out with the likes of Winger real soon.This is possibly the whiniest album this side of Dashboard Confessional. Fred, give it up. The teenage mooks that thought the juvenile butt joke rants on ""Chocolate Starfish"" were the height of rebelliousness have grown up; and covering ""Behind Blue Eyes"" doesn't make you an artiste. Now get outta my face, ya blubbering slob."
1,"God, This Really Sucks...","Limp Bisquick have done it again. Seriously, I though ""Chocolate Starfish"" was bad enough with its generic and recycled riffs used over and over. That album was bad, but this? This is just a sin against nature.Here's an overview of some songs on this record:""Eat You Alive"" - Retarded lyrics and mundane music.""Gimme The Mic"" - Obviously a Beastie Boys ripoff.""Almost Over"" - Fred needs to find a thesaurus and use words other than 'little'.""Red Light Green Light"" - Wow, I almost blew a gasket when hearing this. Snoop Dogg teams up with Durst on this one.""Behind Blue Eyes"" - Fred Durst should be stoned to death for butchering a classic. Have you seen the video? Fred Durst and Halle Berry are just French-kissing enough to piss off the Who.Man, these guys suck. Trent Reznor was right. Fred Durst is the scum of the earth and this album proves it. Definitely beats ""St. Anguish"" to the worst of 2003 list.(...)"
1,Crap,"Limp Bizkit is just a group of losers trying to be cool who end up looking stupid. This album sucks, they practically ruined a The Who classic (Behind Blue Eyes), and Fred Durst tries to be cool, and fails miserably."
3,what happened?,perhaps they should have waited a couple more years to put out a different album...Perhaps we should have known this album wouldnt wouldnt be that good because it wasnt even promoted really. i gave this cd 3 stars because it has about 3 good songs. the rest are real lame (slow crappy songs). pretty much only the first 3 songs on this cd are anygood because they are heavy. the rest are slow and crappy. if your a die hard limp fan then go ahead and buy it. if your new to rock then try something else. this definately isnt as good as theyre 3 previous albums. maybe we'll get something better next time around
1,how far they have fallen,"once upon a time a long time ago they used to be my favorite band right when i started gettting into heavy metal and stuff but soon i grew to dislike them heavily, know there are about two songs by them i like. Fred Durst is widely despised and doesn't care as he keeps producing music that no one will by. This cd is awful do not buy it Fred Durst stop humilating yourself."
1,What the hell?,"Man, It's hard to count how many times me and my friends have dissed limp biskit. They just suck. They try to sound like metal on this album. On the eat you alive they try to sound like pantera by screaming. Nobody can top the great brutalness in pantera. Otherwise limp bizkit sucks and fred durst is a poser. He's also stupid. In gimmie the mic, he says there is no room for posers, it's time for some real performers. Well he is just dissing himself. Do us all a favor and get real metal. you know Black sabbath, Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Led zeppelin, acdc, van halen , etc."
1,No Good - at least I think so,"Got to admit .. Sammy G is right. Limp Bizkit bites.After the song ""rollin"" every other song they have ever came out with ... sucks. This review is also coming from someone from their own home town ...Their marketing plan to get you to buy the album ??? Cuss as much as possible .. thats pretty sad and obvious. The songs are showing less and less talent, as if there ever was really any to begin with ... then again this is just my own opinion ... I could be wrong but I doubt it !"
2,"Results didn't vary, this album is A LET DOWN!","No one is a bigger limp fan than me. Yes the band has gotten older and wants to be recognized as a TRUE rock band, but too many artists try to change their sound, to show how good they think they can be. Besides eat you alive, there isn't one song with the same energy as we have come to expect from Fred and the boys. Artists forget what got them famous and why we love their music. To wait as long as we had to for this album makes it all the worse. Talk about slow songs, I didn't buy a simon and Garfunkel cd, I thought I was buyong LIMP BIZKIT. Where is the energy Fred? Where is the lyrics besides the word "" Baby"" every other song. Big let down dude. I can only hope there is a remix album , that speeds these S L O W songs up. Get back what made you or at least make an album sooner. Im going to throw this one out and pretend it was never made. Don't buy it!"
4,Much much great work,"More of a four and a half ... I really like this new cd though, a lot. This new one brings you back to the days when Significant Other made Limp Bizkit a name that was cool, not a joke. I really like Durst's voice on this one too, whereas it really beganto annoy me by Starfish. His lyrics aren't that great yet, but some are a lot better then prevoius, standout being ""Almost Over"", which i really like. The funk is back too, w/ songs like Phenomenon, the angst is back w/ stuff like Eat you Alive. A lot of people, dont like how Durst complains, but that's what he writes about, and it's really nothing new. I don't know, I enjoy it, but I guess that that's just preference. The only thing bringing it down half a point, would be the fact that this band also made New Old Songs and Chocolate Starfish and some of the lyrcis. Good stuff though."
1,The suckiest sucks that ever sucked,"Lets make this short and sweet. Fred has very awful vocals in this one, can,t growl, scream and his melodic singing in worse than what you get in a karoeoke bar. The guitarring without Wes(he is not that great inside of Limp Bikit eitherway) is just below bland. Bass and drumming is as good as nothing, not special at all. DJ should just perform at parties and weddings. Song are just bad to worst. Avoid this album or band."
1,This sucks,"The only good song is ""Behind Blue Eyes"". Everything else sucks. Want real music? Listen to Lacuna Coil, Slayer, Metallica (even the new stuff's better than this crap!), Stone Temple Pilots, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Suffocation, Crimson Thorn, Strapping Young Lad, Lamb Of God, Arch Enemy, Dimmu Borgir, Old Man's Child, Ozzy/Black Sabbath, AC/DC, etc., etc."
1,yo bro!jock rock man!,Ahhh man this album rules bro!this is the perfect sound track to smashing beer cans on my head a playing some hardcore football. All those haters who say Limp Bizkit and rap rock is over are so wrong. theres nothing better than having some white surburban dude rap about the hard times man.with out mimp bizkit you wouldn't have any of this hardcore or metal they pratically invented it. soo if your smart you'll buy this album. in ten years it will be up there with led zepelinn 2 or even 3..
4,Great Limp Bizkit evolution,"My first though when i heard the release of a new limp bizkit was ""oh no..not again"" haha, but i was wrong. The album show us a different limp bizkit since ""Chocolate starfish.."" or ""Significant other"". It's an interesting and intelligent evolution, i think Fred was forced to come back to his more hardcore roots, and the new guitar player, Mike Smith (ex Snot) was very involved in this evolution. It surprised me the cover of The Who ""Behind Blue Eyes"", very emotional. And other very emotional songs ""Lonely world"" and ""Down Another Day"". And of course the most hardcore songs like the first single (intelligent decision) ""Eat You Alive"", ""Gimme The Mic"" or ""Phenomenon"". And Obviously the collaboraton whit some raper, this time was Snoop Dogg in ""Red light-Green light"" great song. Fred could be the most hated guy in music industry but i have to recognized this a very very good album, an aplause.p.d: My english it's not very good...but you understand right? see ya"
3,selfishness,"Im so sick of people who are always whining because of nu-metal bands such as linkin park, korn and limp bizkit. Saying that their music is bad/sucks, etcetera, etcetera. They are the same people who think that out of all the other 15+ metal genres, there is only ONE of them that should be called ""metal"".They never thought even for a second about all the people who live in countries that even bands like metallica are hard to find in ANY music store because they dont even KNOW what metal music is!!So im grateful that bands like limp bizkit could make it to where I live, even though I never liked ""commercial"" music, metal, hip-hop, whatever it may be. But to me and to at least a few other people like me, its the only choice we have. So, next time before you complain, think about us!!"
3,New Limp Old Limp,"If you are really a Limp fan youll like this cd no matter what. If you have not liked earlier Limp Bizkit stuff, dont worry this cd takes a new direction and previous non limp bizkit fans will enjoy this cd as well. This cd musically may actually be the best limp cd so far. I love it.Having said that you may be wondering why i gave it three stars, well heres why: The cd is great, but its not the Angry Limp Bizkit i have come to know and love.I still recomend it for Limp fans, and even more for the people who didn't like the previos Limp albums."
1,Add in a guy who yells....,and people who can't people muisc what do you get? Limp Biz...I mean Limp Bisuckit. This is the worst band in the history of bad bands. There is nothing good here. If you unless you like some one who yells. If you also like people who can't even play then hey go for this. But if you want real metal music go pick up a Nightwish CD.
5,"A solid album, even though Wes is missing.","This is Limp Bizkit's most mature album. It is more then just !@#$ this and !$#% that. For those of you who don't know, Wes Borland is back with the Bizkit and they have recorded a new album titled ""The Unquestionable Truth"". It is going to be awesome so make sure you check it out when it is released."
3,Could have been better,"I've been a fan of Limp Bizkit ever since they came out with Significant Other. I'd have to say that this is no where close to it. In fact I was pretty disappointed with it, but you have take the album for what it is and not for what the band has produced in the past. This album, for what it is, is an OK album. Has some good songs. This is not an album where you will want to listen to every song over and over again. If you're looking for a masterpiece, this is not the album to buy.What I want to know is if everyone here hates Limp Bizkit so much, what are you doing browsing through their CDs?Anyways, coming from a fan, if you want an album like Significant Other or Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ don't expect Results May Vary to be that album, but if you are willing to try out a different style of music that Limp Bizkit hasn't done before than I'd say buy it. Just don't expect the best."
1,GODDAMNIT!!!,"As I shake my head in disgust I remember the good days. Before Fred became a bitch. Before Wes gave up hope. Thier debut will always remain a favorite of mine. But if I ran into Fred right now, I would beat him so severly that he might actually gain some understanding of what he has done. The crimes he has commited against music are unforgivable. As for the rest of the band, they too should feel shame, for being a part of this corruption of an artform. Fred and the rest are now no better than the boybands and britneys of this world.At least Wes stayed true."
1,worst album i've ever heard!!!,"the whole album is absoloutly SUCK......i hate everysongs.....but i love BEHIND BLUE EYES,that is the best song in the album&for me,that song is the best song in 2003,my whole family love it!!!so it just my opinion,i'm not a fan of them(not hate them too,i'm in between) if you want 2buy this,just do it(u must be a fan of them then u can stand them).....&if you don't,just want 2have a try then don't buy this....."
2,Awful,I have never cared much for ol' freddy but I still listened to this band cause I liked the music. This CD is by far the worst. Aside from a couple good songs Fred spends too musch time dissin and not enough time singin and rhymin like he does best. In my opinion Freddy boy should be banned from the music industry. He has burned way too many bridges and turned his back on some of the bands that helped Limp Bizkit get to where they are today. Save your money and buy something else. The newest Crazytown is better than this CD.
1,This has to rank as one of the worst CD I bought,"I heard the first single from this so called cd ""Eat you alive"" and loved it. Now I never was much of a Limp Bizkit fan but really liked that song so I bought the cd. Besides that song the cd is the worst cd I bought in a long time. All the songs sound the same and it gets old after the 5th song.Don't even think about buying this cd, spend your money on a great group like Linkin Park"
2,The worst Limp album,This album is a big disappointment. I've been a Limp Bizkit fan since their first album and I can tell you that this is the worst CD they've made. There is no good hooks or riffs besides in a few songs. Most of the songs are too similar and have the type of lyrics that nobody really cares about. This definitely nothing like Limp Bizkit's older music. I recomend buying a KoRn or an Insane Clown Posse album instead of this if you are a metal fan.
5,Solid CD from start to finish.,This is one you can listen to over and over without getting tired of it. It's great to find a CD you can listen to all the way through. Most CD's you're having to skip around to find the 2-3 decent songs. Here you can just sit back and enjoy. By far one of their best efforts.
3,A good effort,"THE guitarist of nu-metal has just left your band! all is lost...well not if you're cocky frontman fred durst. complete with a new guitarist, limp bizkit were quickly back on the scene after borlands departure with 'Results May Vary'. Not a bad effort considering the expectations, this being the follow up to one of THE albums of rock in 'Chocolate Starfish...'. Well worth a look."
3,Not bad,"Personally, I don't know how you can like Linkin Park but hate Limp Bizkit. Sure, Fred Durst gets pretty self-absorbed on this record, but there are also several good--dare I say great--songs (like ""Gimme the Mic"" and ""Head for the Barricade""). The guitar work, catchiness, and all around excitement of songs like those make up for Fred's poor lyrics. If you liked Limp before, there's no reason to stop now."
3,It actually is not that bad,"This album is not bad. It is not as good as the other albums, but it has some good songs on it. Clearly they needed Wes Borland back and it happened. I'm looking forward to the next album with him. The reviewer back a few reviews is a loser for thinking that this is the best Limp Bizkit album to date. I mean come on dude."
2,what u should expect,"the best song on this album is the hidden track after ""behind blue eyes"", called ""I wish""....its like a minute long but is the only thing worth listening to on the album"
2,There worst yet,i'm a pretty big fan of limp bizkit been listening to them for a few years was very disapointed with this cd. wouldnt reccomened it. try on of there other cds instead
1,Rage is better...,"first of all, fred needs to get a new day job because his vocals suck. secondly, they need to stop acting like they can play classic rock cuz they can't. they completely ruined the Who's ""behind blue eyes"". third of all, Zach is 10x better at rapping then durst will ever be. at least they don't need snoop dogg to help them out. rage also doesn't need a disc jockey they have tom morrelo instead. lastly rage is 10x heavier than the LIMP will ever be. so if you want some real ""rap""-rock then check out rage against the machine, you won't be disappointed"
1,blech...,"This album is horrible. Limp bizkit has decided to go on without the only talent they ever had (Wes Borland), and create one of the biggest earaches you will ever hear.Definitely not worth buying, not even worth the ten cent CDR to burn it."
1,THE STEALER!!,fred Durst stole lyrics in Phenomenon. He used some lyrics from the song Bring The Noise by Anthrax and Chuck D. I hope he gets found out and sued.
4,This C.D. was a major surprise.,This C.D. shocked me. I bought it because I had always liked Limp Bizkit's style. I was skeptical at first cuz Wes left and he is really what made Limp Bizkit really good. I was amazed at how awesome Results May Vary sounds. It's way different but clearly for the better.
1,This Album BLOWS!!!!!,"Two good tracks: Eat You Alive and Behind Blue Eyes, and the rest is crap!! This is Limp's worst album to date. I now hate limp bizkit because everytime I buy one of there albums the only good tracks are the ones you will see on MTV. They don't even seem to try on the other tracks."
1,THIS ALBUM SUCKED THE MOST ASS IN RECENT MUSIC HISTORY!!!!!!,"ONE OF THE GAYEST,WORST ALBUMS I CAN THINK OF TO DATE,WHY IS FRED DURST TRYIN TO SING,THAT GUY HAS NO TALENT,THE SONG""BEHIND BLUE BALLS""REALLY DOES SUCK MORE ASS THEN ANY OTHER SONG IN MUSIC HISTORY,""EAT YOU ALIVE""SUCKED ASS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE RETARDED ALBUM,IF SOMEONE BUYS THIS,THEY SHOULD BE PUNCHED IN THE FACE AND SLAPPED,AND SOMEONE SHOULD GIVE ME THE MONEY THEY USED TO BUY THIS CRAP SO I CAN GO OUT AND GET A PROSTITUTE,WHICH IS BETTER THEN LISTENIN TO THAT FRUITCAKE FRED DURST,WHO ONLY CAN FANTASIZE ABOUT EVEN BEING WITH BRITTNEY SPEARS,LET ALONE ANGELINE JOLIE,THAT GUY CANT EVEN CAN GET HIS OWN HAND TO LOVE,SO THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYIN,THIS GUY SUCKS AND NEEDS TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT,GROW SOME HAIR AND GO BACK TO THE RETIERMENT HOME,GRAMPS!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This is pathetic........,"I really cannot believe Limp Bizkit actually has new stuff out... I never liked them from the start but pretty much everyone who idolized them back in '99 no longer does.. so I don't know why they are dumb enough to think that anyone cares about them anymore!Limp Bizkit is the pure definition of garbage. Fred Durst represents all that is disgusting, wrong, and not needed.Please do not listen to this garbage- Listen to some REAL metal like Iced Earth or Evergrey!"
1,"Not shocked, good elevator music.","Limp Bizkit should be guest performers on American Idol. All the tracks are weak. If you bought this album I suggest you throw it at someone who gave it 4 or 5 stars. If you like this garbarge you probably like river dancing too, cause that's the only way you can bounce to this h0mo music. The rumors are true, Fred Durst is making a collaboration album with Clay Aiken!! Alright that should keep you Limp Bizkit fans pumped up."
1,Not a good one...,"This must be the worst album by Limp Bizkit...I'm not a big fan of LB but when Wes Borland was still the guitar player, he provide some interesting melodies...Results May Vary got 2 or 3 decent songs, but is incredibly uninspired and the point where Limp Bizkit totally lost their way..."
2,"Sorry, Fred but your not heavy-ass metal","First off this CD is unacceptable compared to limp bizkits last 3 CDs. I liked only 4 of the tracks and one lyric I found offensive. "" You want to hear some heavy-ass metal that can penetrate deep in your ear drums? turn it up mother fxxker! turn it up mother fxxker!"" How the hell can this band think that this is heavy metal?! and if it is I don't want to be a metal-head anymore! You could mabye consider their stuff before chocolate starfish nu-metal, but this is not. so if you want to hear some heavy-ass metal turn it off mother fxxker and put in some killswitch engage mother fxxker. If you still really want a bizkit CD then buy one of the 3 before this, they are much higher quality and in three dollar bill yall (their first CD) they hadn't sold out yet. But if you want some metal buy a killswitch CD, or a shadows fall's CD, or even a mudvayne CD, but do not think that this is heavy metal."
2,What happened to these guys?,"After an album that really took nu-maetal to the next level Fred Durst and his crew had to go and realease the most useless Limp Bizkit Album. From the moment you start listening to this album you will realise how these guys have changed their style. Two to three tracks includung ""Eat You Alive"" have fred durst rapping or screaming his lungs out. The rest of the album is considerably soft with no attenpt at raw heavy nu-metal that Limp Bizkit is renowned for. There is no dout that most Limp Bizkit fans fill find this album to be a dissapointment and like me will eventually start asking themselves What happened to these guys?"
1,dosent even deserve half a star,I notice their is a Parental Advisory sticker on this CD and i Figuerd out why. Parents beware your son or Daughter is listening to complete Ass this Cd sucked so much ass this review sheet wont even give me enough words to describe how much this sucks So its Called results may Vary yes they did vary and the result is $#!T
1,I want my money back.,"Ask yourself one question: ""Why am I not hearing singles from this CD on the radio?"" Answer: this stuff is just plain bad. I liked the previous releases and I did manage (forced myself) to listen to this CD several times. I cringed every time. It's sad that the only glimmer of hope was a cover of ""Behind Blue Eyes"" from The Who... and it was completely botched. At the movie theater you can get a refund if you complain loud enough about a movie that sucks. Unfortunately, there is no retribution for the consumer in the music world. If you buy it and don't like it, too bad. If I can prevent just one person from wasting money on this CD, then I will sleep well at night."
1,I am so sick of Fred Durst. What a loser.,"I don't know who gave this garbage band the idea they had talent, but I keep hearing people say they used to like limp bizkit (They don't deserve to have the letters in their band name capitalized), but this band does not know music. I'm surprised the band hasn't just abandoned Fred Durst and moved on to play their own music, but Fred is the kind of guy who just wants attention. He's just in it for the money, and he wants to impress the fans, if there are any, by making them think he's some kind of bullied little kid, and he thinks they'll feel sorry for him, but he's so wrong. If you want someone to pity you because you've been wronged, then you gain and earn their respect and you don't act like a total p***y at the mic. If he was bullied at school, then why didn't he ever do anything about it? Why does he just keep complaining about it?"
1,One word: Disappointing,I nearly shot my self after having purchased this album and learning how bad it was. Fred Durst give me back my $15 dollars.:logs on to ebay to sell it for 25 cents:
1,holy freaking crap...this SUCKS,"OK, I was never a fan of Fred, I think he's a no-talent loser. Even so, I could tolorate some of Limp's older songs. I thought this might not be half-bad. I was going to rate this a 1-star cd, but then I heard something horrible: Fred had the NERVE to cover one of my favorite Who songs ever!! and Fred killed it and pissed on it's grave. I cannot tell you the ANGER I felt when I heard this. The Who were the greatest rock band in history, and Pete Townshend has written some of the best music of the past 40 years. And Fred thinks he can sing one of their songs!/! SHAME on you!!!! All I can tell you is, DESTROY this cd and buy anything by The Who if you want to hear how Behind Blue Eyes is supposed to sound."
1,"I""D GIVE IT A ""0"" IF I COULD!","This CD weak!! This band is weak!! Fred Durst cant sing, he's way overexposed and it obviously shows that music is last on his list of priorities. Dont waste your hard earned $$$ on this ""LIMP"" CD!!"
1,Please no more,"This record sounds like Limp Bizkit trying to return to their earlier sound from Three Dollar Bill, but really they just ripped off the songs with a new guitar player. There were several moments where I thought, ""Haven't I heard a better version of this before?"" Also, I like Snoop Dogg and he can't even save the track ""Greenlight"" or whatever......I think it's about failing driving school or something. And finally, there's this one track where Fred rhymes ""baby"" with......""baby"" like 100 times in his rap. I hope Limp Bizkit retires to party with Playmates all day and not make any more music for the love of the money, cause they sold out a long time ago."
4,Pretty Decent,"I used to be obbsessed with BIzkit, but now its Good charlotte(big change). This cd is good, but what really makes it are Almost Over, Build A Bridge, Underneath the Gun,and Down another Day. I am not that in to the metal side of them anymore. If you like metal you will like most of this album. If you like softer nicer songs you will like 25% of this album. My friends want me to sell this cd to them and i say no. even though i am not into limp bizkit that much, this is a very good album."
3,Wow...this makes u depressed :-/,"Wow! I would never think Limp Bizkit would switch gears into this type of music. It really is soft and slow. Besides ""Eat You Alive"" most of the album is slow.Behind Blue Eyes made me almost kill the computer from depression it really touches ur heart. Not for the Weak.But very good guitar and lyrics.So is Build A Bridge.For you soft ppl. Yep Soft Limp Bizkit has ARRIVED.dang it does really make u sad :("
3,"Go Head, Fred!","Limp has come back with that underwater sound that gives them a kindof uniqueness. People have mentioned other songs of brilliance on the album, but no has mentioned the blended melody of Down Another Day. That song is simply awesome! I give it a 3 because I didn't just fall in love with all of the songs on the album...but who am I to criticize!?! Until I (or you out there) can produce something better, Go Head, Fred! (and the rest of the Bizkit)"
4,Buy This Album!!,"This is a pretty good album. Bizkit are not that at acoustic songs, but on this album they were. I don't understand why a couple of the songs are either acoustic or non-distortion songs, but they came out good. Eat You Alive has a good rythm and I recommend this album for everyone. Mike is the new guitarist is good but no Wes Borland.Great Album!!!"
2,Warning,"This album has some Potential good songs on it, but the lyrics arw so goofy and meaningless that i actually laughed throughout the whole album, which i got from a friend cause he hated it. Im not kidding by the time the disc ended i was on the floor in pain from laughing so hard. Thank god they hung it up finally."
1,Results Did Vary,"I cannot believe how bad this album is! The new guitarist is good he fills up wes borland's place really well. The only good song in this album that is ""Limp Bizkit"" is Eat You Alive. It's one of their best songs ever. The rest is just like N'Sync attempting rock. Behind blue eyes what kind of trash is that. This is certainy not limp bizkit. What happened to the real rock in their first 2 albums three dollar bill being in my opinion the best then significant other. What is wrong with them? I only hope limp bizkit wake up and see they lost a big number of their fans by releasing this garbage, POP , sorry for an excuse of a limp bizkit album!"
2,Sad enough I Bought this C.D.,Ok the reason i bough tthis C.D. was because i liked their single Eat you Alive i thought it was catchy but when i recieved it and played the whole C.D. through i thought it just sucked with the xeception of a couple of songs that sounded alright i thought Build A Bridge and Behind Blue Eyes were alright Eat You Alive is pretty good but all in all Limp Bizkit doesnt have much Talent and if i could change what i woul have boughten i prob would have bought like a Ozzy Osbourne cd or something but yeah dont get this unless you truely love limp bizkit
1,"What happened...SOLD OUT, period","Wow, it is really difficult to tell the difference between Justin Timberlake and Fred Durst (limp bizkit) these days. This CD isnt even worth the sin it costs to steal it. I cant believe how terrible this band has gotten. It seems as if they are just coming out with new albums to make a quick buck. If you want nu-metal the way Limp Bizkit should have been, check out Ill Nino, Korn, or P.O.D. but leave this one for the pop princesses. Very depressing."
4,It's pretty good,I for one like limp bizkit i think all there albums were good I would recommend this album to anyone who like's limp bizkit give this album a try. And for all those people who think linkin park is better please!!!! all there songs sound the same and there annoying.
4,Excellent,"This product was just what I had been searching for. It arrived within a few days, so I was able to finish my project quickly. Thank you."
5,An insiders view of the Battle of Midway,"This book is an expansion of the account contained in his memoir ""Crossing the Line."" He provides details that few others will have found in the conventional histories. His point of view is that of an 18-year-old ordnanceman for a torpedo squadron. Another review has complained of his criticism of the navy and some of the officers. There are standard hagiographies that would suit such critics. Those of us who have served in the military are aware that not everyone is a superman. The fact remains that Midway was won with fantastic luck. Wade McCluskey found the Japanese carriers and few remember his name. I wish someone would write a biography of McCluskey. Alvin Kernan might just be the right person. This book is indispensible to anyone who wants to study the history of the Second World War in the Pacific."
2,Nothing New,"Those familiar with the Battle of Midway will find nothing new here. On the contrary, the book is so full of errors and misconstructions of fact that it only further distorts the reasons behind the tragic slaughter of the U.S. torpedo planes and their aircrews during this famous battle. Much of the technical information cited in this book is outdated, inaccurate, or incorrectly analyzed, leading to erroneous errors and conclusions throughout the text. Readers wanting to know the real story to the U.S. torpedo planes would be better off obtaining a reprint of Lord's classic work Incredible Victory, Lundstrom's First Team, or the newly released Shattered Sword by Parshall and Tully."
4,Another perspective,The Unknown Battle of Midway: The Destruction of the American Torpedo SquadronsThis book is a very quick and very informative read and offers a very different perspective as to the Midway encounter. I recommend it.
3,Great Concepts--and otherwise,"I bought this out of an intense interest of semiotic approaches toward language and culture.I love the concepts that Lotman covers, the only problem is the style they are written is very circumlocutionary--the whole time I'm reading, I'msaying, ""OK, but now get to the point."" Extremely verbos style, extremely high lexical density makes for difficult reading.The concepts, however, are fabulous. Especially the particular issue of the ""semiosphere"" as representative of a diachronic intersection of fluidexchanges converging in any single moment/place/time. Excellent stuff."
4,Debbie Does It Again,"I wish they let you give 4 1/2 stars, four is too low. The songs on this recording were recorded in 1959 and 1960, when Debbie was getting over her divorce to Captain Dunce himself, Eddie Fisher. Trade Debbie Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor, what was he thinking? What am I thinking? Back to the album. This collection is a group of jazz oriented songs that would be performed in a casino or the like. These would've worked very well for Frank Sinatra or Bing Crosby. In fact, Bing includes some comments in the liner notes. I love Debbie Reynolds, so I had to get this. If you like jazz get this, if you like Debbie, get this period. Although her biggest hit, ""Tammy,"" is left off, her other hits are here, like ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"" and ""Am I That Easy To Forget."" I enjoyed ""City Lights"" very much as well. The album is titled, ""Debbie/Am I That Easy To Forget."" Well Debbie, no you are NOT! I'll always treasure you're performances, whether acting or singing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! Stinks.,"Okay, when using a Thesaurus - you quickly want to look up a word and get another word to use in its place, right?YOU WILL NOT GET THAT WITH THIS VERSION. This one refers you to another word in the book, you go to the next word and it refers you yet again to another word. Very few words have what you will be looking for. WASTE OF MONEY - DO NOT BUY.You get tons of useless information, but that's about it.I don't understand why this book is set up the way it is and find it USELESS. It is currently resting under my bed."
4,Time to fly,"This album should not be listened to while driving. The haunting melodies and etherial voices have a tendancy to make you want to close your eyes and see other-worldly images, not good while driving! The best feature, and worst feature, is it's lack of variety from one song to another. For casual listening it may not be your cup of tea, but for using for meditation or body work (Reiki, Yoga, Massage) it may just be perfect. Worth the buy."
1,Is He Kidding?,"I would have given this book no stars if given the option. If you want to read about the Fifties Red Scare look somewhere else. This book is full of innuendos, unsubstantiated anecdotes, and blatant lies. Fariello will not even admit that there WERE atomic secrets during the forties and fifties. He consistently ignores any evidence of any wrongdoing by any leftist, Communist or fellow traveler. It seems that he would have the reader believe that there never was ANY espionage going on at this time. For a more interesting book-one backed up by thorough source material-read""Bombshell"" by Albright and Kunstel.There is no doubt that the hysteria that swept the country at this time was the cause of wrongful prosecutions and harrassment by government of those on the political left but this really is not the book to learn about these facts."
1,Unstable stand,The stand was unstable and not square. We didn't feel it would be able to support the 360 lb surface plate and returned it.
4,"Beethoven Violin Concerto, David Oistrakh","While the quality of recording is not the greatest, David Oistrakh's playing is superb. I have over the years heard his performance of the this concerto with various orchestras of the world, I am partial to this one, with Alexander Gauk conducting. Particularly the religious, moving first movement."
3,Reebok Men's Ignited Run Running Shoe,"Shoes are quality made. No cinch loop on toungue for strings to pass through. I have been regularly using the Road Lite Premier running shoe.It has the transitioning bridge. This Ignited Running shoe does not use the transitioning bridge, is less flexible and has a wider forward sole. The shoes are not shown on the color coded chart that comes with reeboks other shoes. I found the shoes ""clippity cloppity"" and stiff. I suffered ankle and knee pains after using them. I have a high arch and typically run 4-8 miles per day. They are sturdy shoes and well made from quality materials and stitching. The size was correct and true for a reebok.I can not reccomend them for running though."
3,It's Just A Broom - No Handle!,"Unless you want to sweep on your hands and knees, make sure you purchase the handle separately!"
2,Not worth buying,"Unless you are a huge Johnny Cash fan this CD is not worth buying. Half the cd is Linda Ronstadt,Foster Brooks, and Roy Clark. For a real good behind prison walls cd buy Live at Folsom Prison or Live at San Quentin"
1,I'm sure the guys in the prison enjoyed it,"This has ""made-for-T.V."" written all over it. Not the best Cash live recording I've heard (the DVD isn't that impressive either), though I'm sure the guys in the prison enjoyed it. I think I would have enjoyed reading about this show more than listening to it."
1,Johnny Cash Behind Prison Walls appears to be overdubbed,"This show was done actually around 1974 and was originally released on a video called ""A Flower Out Of Place"" in the early 1980's. It was a show originally hosted by Glen Shirley who wrote the Cash hit ""Greystone Chapel"" from the ""Live At Folsom Prison"" album. Although I have not purchased the new CD or DVD, I have seen the video broadcast on satellite. It is in my estimation after having seen and heard the original video that that Cash's band members W.S. Holland (drums) and Marshall Grant (bass) were overdubbed with tracks recorded by other musicians. I don't know why it would be done this way, but I'm afraid that it is true. I do not plan to purchase the CD or DVD."
2,Underpowered and overpriced,"Anyone who purchases a BA-35, uses it and then tries out the TI BA II Plus for about 12 bucks more is going to suffer a bad case of buyer's remorse. The 35 is woefully underpowered in financial calculation capability compared to the next higher level of financial calculators. The reason I have one is that is is one of the required calculators for the actuarial exams (for reasons I have yet to figure out).My overall recommendation is -- if you want a financial calculator that has actual capability, spring for either the HP12c or the TI BA II Plus."
5,Works Fine,"Nothing wrong with this product. It cuts good, lasts reasonably well and doesn't come apart. If I had one complaint, it is that the seam is rather lumpy making the work bounce as it passes by. For fine work, this would be a problem."
4,"A Good Idea, But...","Keely Smith is one of my favorite female vocalists, and Billy May is fine arranger, conductor and trumpet player. So this 1962 collaboration for Dot records should have been a classic package. Unfortunately, it's not as good as it could have been. Twelve ballads performed faster than the composers intended didn't work in 1962 when Keely was a household name, and they're less effective in this Jasmine reissue. The distinctive voice and phrasing are good, but the ""To Each His Own,"" ""Where Is Your Heart,"" ""Stranger in Paradise"" and the other tunes are delivered at a pace better suited for the dance bands of the early 1930s. Both Smith and May have done better, but if you're a Keely collector, you'll want this to add to your stash."
5,What A Voice!!!,I have several Keely Smith cd's from old to new and this is probably one of my favorite's. Keely and Billy May together are a hit!!!
4,The TI 73,"The TI 73 is the best. At least in my opinion, it is the best for all the people in Middle School. If you are in Middle school at this moment and you need a graphing calculator for math or science, don't go out and spend alot of money on another kind of calculator. The TI 73 is fit for the job!"
5,Brings back memories,"These dolls are the real deal! I really think Mattel found the original mold when they made these dolls. Suffice it to say, these dolls may be repro but they are even better than vintage as they are brand new. From head to toe, Barbie and Ken are dressed to perfection in their 1959 duds. No kidding, everything is totally like the vintage dolls. If your original Barbie mysteriously disappeared somewhere, get this gift set and you have her back in all her glory with her favorite guy, Ken by her side.Vintage stuff is great but with this set, you cannot tell the difference."
4,Great Imagination! Enjoyable Read:,"I was touched profoundly by John Martin's extraordinary imagination.I sensed a wonderful mysticism ,synonymous ,perhaps, with the authors obvious Irish heritage.Once I got past the introduction's of the character's ,I could not put this book down. The ending came too quiclky and left me wanting more. I am looking forward to more of John Martin's imagination."
2,Broken,"I gave this cookbook 2 stars because although it was exactly what I was looking for, it came in an unacceptable condition. My mother had the original book for as long as I can remember and it had become well worn. Pages were falling out of it. This book was for all intesive purposes the same. When I gave it to my mom for Christmas she was so excited. Unfortunately, the three ring binder on it was broken. This is very bad considering that you need them to turn the pages. I would say that considering it was brand new, this was unacceptable"
3,better homes and garden 1953 classic edition (used),i had been looking for this edition for awhile and it was great to find it at amazon. the quality was fair but was for a gift to family member. she loved it.
2,Fifties cooking at its worst,"I had high hopes when I bought this reproduction cook book, based on my memories of my mother's (1947) edition of this famous cook book. However, the '47 edition was much better. This one is full of '50s-era recipes, with lots of canned food, gross casseroles made of Spam, etc. Plus the pages are ""browned"" to look like the book is aged, which just adds to the yucch factor. The food looks icky and the layout and illustrations are charmless. Want a retro cookbook? Buy the 1950 Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book (it's great!) or haunt the used bookstores for an old edition of The American Woman's Cook Book. Both are superior to this one."
5,BEST OF THE BEST FAVORITE RECIPES,I WAS SO PLEASED TO RECIEVE THE 1953 CLASSIC EDITION. I HAD BEEN USING MY GRANDOTHERS COPY FOR YEARS AND IT HAS JUST WORN OUT BETWEEN HER USE AND THEN MINE. I LOVED THAT THE PAGES OF THIS CLASSIC EDITION WERE DISTRESSED TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT THAT THE ORIGINAL HAD. THANKS FOR REPRODUCING THIS COOKBOOK.
5,This game rocks,"I rented this game once and was really let down at first. I thought that I had rented a multiplier flying game. But once I started to play I realized this was the best flying game I'd ever played, and I still think it is the best. It gives control over targets, weaponry, and other ships like never before. Rogue Leader for game cube was supposed to be the ultimate in control, but Starlancer really gives you the feeling of really being in the action. This game is a must buy!"
3,Pales in comparison to the rest of the Tenchi Universe,"I hate to say this... but this video is perhaps the ONLY Tenchi Muyo production that I was disappointed by. If you expect the same consistent and well-rendered animation, you'll get it for the most part. But here's what you won't get: The same dubbed voices for many of the characters- they're gone. Some really whacky and unsightly animation flaws- there are a few that took me aback. And lastly, a storyline is missing. I'm a HUGE Tenchi fan, so I still deem it watchable, but don't compare it to the rest of the series. Try ""Tenchi Muyo! in Love""."
5,A new direction for Mike Errico,"The new CD takes off in a new direction. Instead of the folk instrumentation of his previous work, we find a full rock band. Much of the energy of Mike's recent live CD is present in the studio product. If you've followed Mike Errico you will be pleased, if you haven't you will be in for a treat."
4,A Passion for Seafood,"What a wonderful cookbook for fish. As we try to eat healthier and eat more fish, it is difficult to find good recipes that allow the real flavor and texture of the fish to shine through. Gordon Ramsey's book has tons of great recipes with wonderfully light sauces and fresh vegetables that compliment each type of fish perfectly. He's even thrown in a few dessert recipes for those of us who like to end a meal with a taste of something sweet! This book is a winner!"
4,Worked for me,I have had these on hand for awhile. When I feel anxiety creeping in to my day I usually take 2 at the same time and dissolve under my tongue. Shortly after taking I begin to feel calm. I am ordering multiple boxes; I would rather have a homeopathic solution than zoloft or xanax.
3,Chair Dancing -- Quite a workout,"Jodi Stolove's Chair DancingJodi Stolove's Chair Dancing Through the DecadesJodi Stolove's Chair Dancing Around the WorldInjuries may keep you off your feet. But with Chair Dancing you can still get plenty of exercise. I've purchased three of the Chair Dancing DvDs. They provide fun, interesting exercise that can be done sitting or standing. The 35 - 45 min sessions provide warm-up, work-out and cool-down and allow for differing fitness levels.These programs provide aerobic and coordination exercise, not strength training."
2,poor exercise,Just thought it was more for elderly people so that's who I gave it to in a nursing home.
4,Fantastic,"This album is fantastic if not perfect. I like the first track ""Soft Smoke"" which has great guitar playing at the beginning of the song. Wicked song. The second ""Saturday Nite Riot"" ain't as good as the first one but still good. My favorite songs on this cd are ""Modern Swinger"" a extremely catchy song and ""Little Razorblade"" a awesome track. I usually go for stuff like The Click Five and Mcfly but I do like the Pink Spiders too."
5,A Must-read for all Harried Mothers,"After reading the book, I suggest that it should be a must-read for all the harried mothers of the western world - and for many harried fathers, as well. It tells us everything we need to know about how to effectively and safely delegate routine housework, and why that is often, if not usually, the best option.All that, and it's wonderfully entertaining, too! The writing style is breezy with just the proper balance between statistics to prove the point and amusing anecdotes to drive the point home.My favorite section is the historical analysis of how we got where we are - where women in our society shoulder the lion's share of homemaking tasks and think that a proper mother would never delegate the washing of clothes and the preparation of meals, but she will quite happily delegate the raising of her children - often while she washes their clothes and prepares their meals.Read it and see if a light doesn't come on for you as it did for me."
4,Don't let your housework ruin your marriage,Please read this book if you feel overwhelmed by housework and family responsibilities. I have always believe in having a housekeeper especially if you were married and with children. A housekeeper is not a luxury but a necessity as having a car to get around town. Having help will allow you and your family (either if you are married or not) to have more time for yourself and with your loved ones. What is the point of working hard to the point of becoming exhausted if you do not have the energy to enjoy simple things in life? Don't let housework and stress ruin your marriage or any relationship you now have.
1,Selfless plugs,"This ""author"", and I use that term loosely, has the nerve to write several ""customer reviews"" (as opposed to editorial reviews, which she is obviously not qualified to do) on several ground breaking amd creative books regarding social and economic conditions. For what reason? To shamelessly promote her own book. This is a pathetic attempt to plug her own work, and its a disgrace to legitimate authors. She ought to be ashamed of herself, not only for her comments, but for this pathetic literary attempt. Shame on you Kathy Sherman."
5,amazing,"this album is truely something different....I have always been in hot pursuit of new music..(not the radio ready kind)...I just bought Beluah? yoko....Holy Sons....Arab Strap,Hugs and Pints at the...blah blah blah...not since The Shins ""oh interverted world"" have I enjoyed an album so much...and been surprised by the consistency of quality in the writing..for example..I bought the Fruit Bats recently,...and the record was good, but had no spark....from ""Banner"", to ""Cuba""...Laguardia's songs make me sing. The only problem is that i know pretty soon every one else will be singing too and it is going to drive me out of my mind...so i'll enjoy it now while it lasts.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
3,booka-ma-thing love hate,"the contents of this book WILL entertain kids as old as 80 !however the darn pages keep falling off the spiral binder. the pages are made of thick paper (wonderfull) but with constant adjustment of the wire binding, this makes it difficult to turn the pages easily.Have resorted to taking it apart and getting o- rings to keep every thing intact.If you can make it through this frustration you will enjoy. By the way... this is the second one I have purchased in the past 8 years."
3,"Great Book, but not quite enough to do...","I like the book a lot! All the games they have in there are really fun, but can get boring after awhile. They should've put in more games, or at least make the games a little more interesting. All in all it's a well designed book, sturdy, durable and all the pieces are well contained!"
4,Daughter and wife love it!,"Bought this game for Christmas. My daughter and wife love it, and it is a great workout! The addition of the Wii remotes adds a different dimension and a higher level of difficulty. A worthwhile buy...just add another dance pad!"
4,Great family fun!,"We've had several nights of playing ""DDR"". My kids 9 & 11 have a blast really getting into the music and steps. I definitely recommend playing with the remote and nunchuck if you have the Wii to get your whole body into. The only thing I didn't expect was that the dancers on the game are not doing the same steps as you (the player) so you definitely need to be creative."
1,Everything is lacking,"I am a long time veteran of DDR and was excited this morning when I opened my present -a Wii DDR. The song list looked good, and the hand movement idea seemed promising. But when I started playing, I was very dissapointed. All of the songs had been DDRified, and I could not find the menu to turn speed to my usual 1.5 and the strange arrows off. There were arrows that spun, funny ones in ice, and ones that looked like bombs from previous DDR titles. To use your hands, you just sort of twitch. Not dance. I would give a more in depth review but I only played it for so long before I got annoyed with the DDRified music and the seemingly unchangable speed. Get the PS2 one if you can. I recommend DDR Max 2 or DDR Extreme. Supernova is OK too. I think this might be a good option for kids though, but for anyone older than 11, its a big NO."
3,"over all, be careful of waht you step into....","it's good game to have, but, you better be careful of what you step into...cause i twice my ankle...."
2,Broke within a week!!!,"DDR is great fun!! My kids played it all day for Christmas and even got their aunt, uncle & Papa to get up and dance! Great exercise for us!Unfortunately, the Wii remote controls made it more difficult, so my kids didn't use them--they just danced on the dance pad. Then, the DVD that came with it stopped working. We ended up sending it back for a refund. We then bought the Playstation version.DDR is a great game, but avoid the Wii version. Buy the Playstation version instead!!"
4,New DDR Addict,"I've owned this game since the release date and have played almost every day since. This is my first experience with DDR outside of Dave and Busters, and I have to say that this game is awesome.I can't even begin to get above the second level of play, but I'm having so much fun with the first two levels, that I really don't mind. I have found the graphics just fine for my purposes, and the song selection is a good one that ranges from recent hits to favorite oldies.One of the best things about this game is that without changing my diet, I've lost 6 lbs and lots of inches in a little over 3 weeks. I've got more energy and actually look forward to a form of aerobic exercise.I would recommend investing in some type of padding to put under the dance pad as there isn't much cushion but that is pretty much my only gripe.I highly recommend this game for both beginners of all ages and for more advanced players."
4,Menus not as intuitive as other games.,"I will leave the critical work of reviewing the minutia of the gameplay of ""DDR Hottest Party"" to more capable reviewers. Suffice to say, the gameplay itself carries on both the Wii's tradition of simple, casual gaming with the now familiar interface that has become the hallmark of the DDR franchise.My biggest problem in familiarizing myself with DDR Hottest Party can be summarized with one hint: GET OFF THE DANCEPAD WHEN YOU'RE IN THE GAME'S MENU SYSTEM. If you're standing on a control pad when you're in a menu, the game acts like a Windows PC with a stuck key, perhaps aptly so."
4,Very fun with OK graphics,"This game is very addicting. I pre-ordered it for my wife expecting her to play it exclusively. I've been playing it on and off. It can be a nice form of exercise and since you're moving your whole body on the pad, it doesn't make you as sore as a long Wii Sports session.Moving your hands with the wiimote is challenging along with the foot steps.The pad reminds me of the old Nintendo Power Pad in terms of quality and appearance. It connects using one of the gamecube controller compatibility ports on the Wii.The graphics are not the most amazing, even on the Wii. After seeing a game like Zelda, it just seems boring to look at.Some of the songs are unlocked as you progress. It doesn't seem to ask you to use your miis in the game which I found to be a disappointment. It does track some of your progress."
4,Fun For All,"This game is great! It's got lively music, fun colors and sets and is addicting! It's got several different modes that enable to you play against the computer or a partner or with a partner, so that together you can beat more difficult stages. The score rating is a bit harsh and inconsistent the higher you get into it, but it's fun to play, so that doesn't really matter!It's a great party game (when you purchase additional dance pads) or can be played for enjoyment on your own! Overall, it's an awesome game and won't disappoint!!"
3,Pretty fun,"Overall, it's pretty fun; however, it's hard to get the timing down at first, especially with the hand controls, which can be very frustrating. I don't drag the pad out as much as I thought I would, but it still is something different to do with the Wii. I recommend playing it at a friend's a few times before committing to ordering it."
5,Great for the Tween Crowd,Our daughters have had a ball with this Christmas present. The 12 yr old and her friends really enjoy it and it challenges them - she thinks the grading is really tough. But even in just a few weeks she has moved up from D's to A's on some of the songs. Her friends all choose to play this when they come over.The 6 yr old who desperately tries to keep up with her older sister always gets D's - because the game is made for 10+ yrs old and her legs cannot even reach all the sensors. It doesn't deter her though - she loves the music and will stand next to her sister and mimic the moves without being on the pad. They have so much fun dancing every night. (Although it does freak them out when their dad and I start singing the words to all these songs from the 70's/80's.... It also is kind of weird that our 3 yr old is walking around singing Disco Inferno!) Great purchase for our family.
5,Best game for a fun work-out.,"I love the work-out I get from this game. There is an actual work-out function in which you can input your stats and choose how many calories you want to burn. Then all you have to do is dance, dance and it will tell you when you accomplish your goal. I don't even realize I'm working out, it's just fun dancing to good music. My only complaint would be that there are only so many songs, and as of now, it's not possible to download more."
4,Lots of fun,"This is the first DDR game that I have purchased. My husband and I have lots of fun playing, we are both novices. We ended up purchasing a second mat so that we could play together. The mat selection seems to be limited and not nearly as many choices as with the PS2. The hand motions give the game an added challenge. I like the workout mode where you can set the number calories you want to burn and they game keeps giving you new songs until your reach your target number. It does pause after each song to give you a score but you can jump right through that by pressing the A button.Overall it's a great interactive game where you can burn some calories."
2,Dance Dance,I don't like that you also have to do hand moves. They don't seem to sink up correctly. Music is kind of lame. I hardly know any of the songs.
3,Is a mess using your hands ( En espanol Tambien),"The game features great music as all the DDR, but it seems like the sync with the wii remote dont work as well as the pad. Sometimes (not to say always) I used to shake the wii remote at the same time I was suppose to, but still it dosen't get it is not sync. I will recommend to just play the old DDR with out using thye hands.El juego es divertido pero no lo malo es que aveces no esta sincronizado para utilizarse con las manos. Es mejor el juego normal de DDR. La musica como siempre esta super."
4,Dance Dance Revolution,Game is great family fun. The dance pad is a little small for adults but all in all an enjoyable way to get some exercise!
4,Great Entertainment,I bought this product for my cousin and she was thrilled with it. I'm horrible at Dance Dance Revolution but the kids love it and the package isn't bad for the price.
2,Boring and not Dancing,"My daughter and I played this for about a half an hour right after I got it and we found it just ok. It doesn't have anything to do with dancing except for the music. You are not dancing, you are just stepping on arrows and waving your hands when they come up.It might be fun for kids but not anyone older. If you want to get off your duff while having fun, try the new Live Active Outdoor Challenge game. It is awesome!Active Life Outdoor Challenge"
2,Not as easy as it looks!,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife who wanted it for working out. She's having a hard time with it. The game came with minimal documentation and no instructions, so she's unable to figure out how to use it. She tried going on line for help, but the help she received didn't apply to the version we have so she's still nowhere with it. Our next step will be to recruit the services of one of the neighborhood kids to teach her how to use it.Bottom line: make sure you know how to play it before you get it."
4,This game is great fun!,"This game is an absolute blast! My entire family (age 5 on up) LOVE this game. There are some easier songs for the little ones and boy do they get harder for the adults. The hand markers add an extra challenge, however, they can be turned off to simplify game play. The only downfall in my opinion is in the workout mode, there is just way too much time between songs to get a really effective workout, by the time I get into the next song my heart rate has already almost returned to normal. Still, what a great way to get off the couch and move around and have fun in the process!!!"
3,fun,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter as she had the same for her PS2 many years ago, thinking that she would take to this one with the same enthusiasm, much to my horror she said it was too hard, and to date only played on this about 3 times in total, maybe its the coordination (hands and feet) and she may just get into it in months to come, but from a parent perspective its a bit difficult, other than that the product is good, the mat i have to say is a little low cost, but suppose with anything costs have to be cut to bring the overall sale price into realistic values...All in all, its ok with good tracks and decent workouts, just maybe not ideal if your kids are under 12..."
2,Two thumbs WAY down,"Let me start by saying that I used to LOVE the old DDR game back when it was on Xbox. Great techno music to dance to and fun game modes. THIS game however, exciting dance moves and instead replaces it with the Wii Controller. The music was also VERY low-grade, which was not what I was expecting since I am a big 80s music fan.Maybe it's me whose changed, but this game just doesn't pack the same punch."
2,A Longtime DDR Fan,"I got this for Christmas and was thrilled. Before anything, we had our Wii set up and I was ready for dancing.My first observation upon beginning game play was that I had to turn off the pesky hand movements part of the game. They were really just taking away from the all around experience.Then, I saw the song list and was pretty disappointed. Some of the tracks were really fun..but it seemed mostly to comprise of radio songs with a techno twist.The dances seemed a lot easier and well..it's just not a classic DDR game.After playing for about a month, unlocking some of the better songs, my final say on the game is that looking at it as a game..seperated from it's predecessors, it's alright.Looking at a long history of amazing DDR games though..this is a big let down.Perhaps if we could move back to some of the more ""DDR like"" songs the game would be better."
3,DDR HOTTEST PARTY BUNDLE,"THE DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION HOTTEST PARTY BUNDLE WAS ON TOP OF MY DAUGHTERS CHANUKAH LIST. I PURCHASED IT AND SHE IS LESS THAN OVERWHELMED. SHE FEELS THE SONGS ARE LACKING AND THE CHALLENGE IS NOT THAT GREAT. SHE PLAYED FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR AND THEN PUT IT AWAY. IT SEEMS TO GET THEM MOVING AS SHE WAS EXCERCISING AS SHE DANCED AND SHE LIKED THAT IDEA, BUT SHE FELT IT WAS ""BLAH"". I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER DDR GAMES HAVE AS FAR AS THE MUSIC AND CHALLENGE SELECTION."
1,disappointed,I brought the game used and I guess you get what you pay for. The disc didn't work and I had to send it back.
4,Fun!,"This game is really cool! They have some cool songs like ""clocks"" (originally coldplay), ""1 2 step"" ""too little too late"" ""right round (like a record)"" ""99 red balloons"" and a lot of older songs. Plus you have the opurtunity to unlock new songs and arenas. The crowd will often ""request"" a song and if you win, you can unlock that song. Also the wii mote is added in that certain moves call for you to move your hand up or down along with the foot step. The one thing that does annoy me though is the guy who talks when you dance (like every 20 beats). He says stuff like ""in danger of failing"" or ""awesome,"" but he annoys me, I just want to hear the music and ignore him. Overall, I really enjoyed the game even though I am horrible at DDR."
2,Not Really Good,"I felt that this game just wasn't worth the money I spent, and oh boy was it a pretty penny! The responsiveness of the Wii Controler just wasn't working, and I just was disapointed overall."
4,wii dance dance revolution,"game is fun for all ages.had some problems in the beginning though. bought the bundle, but the dance pad wouldn't work. hear that's a problem with some of them. i think we just had a dead pad. well, we exchanged it for a new one, and it works perfectly fine. if you're having problems connecting the pad to your wii, just exchange it for a new one. hopefully, you'll get one that works.other than that, it's a fun game. it's a bit different than the other ones since this allows for hand movements to be included in the routine. it's more challenging, but also very confusing. but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad."
4,Fun but mat could be better,The game itself is fun and really needs practice to get to higher levels. The mat can slip on wooden floors and doesn't respond to all touches consistently so I would say it is adequate minus. They really need to improve this mat. I was wondering how other mats from other companies interact.
2,the pad is busted after 6 weeks,"The game is fun and all but the big downer in my case was that the DDR dance pad started malfunctioning after 6 weeks for fairly light play. Specifically, one of the buttons (A) seems to be stuck and one cannot override by using the corresponding wiimote button.I'm still investigating the warranty options. Amazon's site is amazingly devoid of any hints about warranty support."
4,Fun New DDR Experience,"I've had this game a couple days and it has been SO MUCH FUN!If this is your first DDR experience I suggest playing on an easier difficulty (maybe without the hand movements) until you get better so you don't get overwhelmed. Also the first level in groove circuit mode is a tutorial type song that should help. If you already have one of the older DDR games (I had PS2's Supernova), the new hand movements, special blocks, double taps, new songs etc add alot which makes this one worth adding to your game collection.I WOULD have given this 5 stars, but I would like to see them offer smaller motion sensors that could be strapped securely to your wrists. It may seem like a small picky little thing, but after an hour or so your hands get tired of holding the controllers (don't forget to use your safety strap!)"
4,What's not to like?,"So far this looks like quite a winner. We also bought a second mat, so two of them dance at once. The second mat is highly recommended to make this a more social exercise. It doesn't really resemble dancing, but at least it provides a bit of exercise trying to keep up."
4,Funny and melodious.,"The acting and the sound is good.Sweet and melodious, plus a funny young Dulcamara. I like the package.The display is new but it does the job."
2,AIRFORCE - NOT AFRICAN FORCE,"Judging from the samples provided, this appears to be a compilation of material from Ginger Baker's Airforce - NOT African Force - a completely different outfit. You'll hear Denny Laine sing Man of Constant Sorrow and Steve Winwood sing Do What You Like. I just wonder what is going on with the profusion of semi-bootlegged, and poorly packaged material surrounding Ginger Baker lately. This is clearly just another sloppy attempt to cash in on previously released material."
3,nice heavy weight,"heavy and washes up okay - but be prepared for it to shrink - 2xlt isn't really correct. It is long enough for a 6' 5"" gut though"
3,Not worth the hype,"I've used this hose heavily for 1.5 yrs. Is it a nice hose? Yes. Is it a great hose? No. Not at the 2x (or more) the price tag vs. rubber IMO.Likes: Doesn't stretch (permanently), lighter weight, doesn't kink easy, less friction while dragging around objects.Dislikes: more 'memory' and 'springy' than rubber (easier for it to trip you, get caught on things, or twist on itself - a MAJOR safety hazard IMO), price"
4,Good Hose--No Fittings Included,"This is a great hose. I got this recently and it works well, and I do think it's better than a rubber hose.There are no fittings included with this hose, so once it arrives, you have to go out and buy fittings for each end in order to hook it up and use it. Amazon.com apparently doesn't carry the fittings (what's up guys I though you had no shelf space issues? Stock all the parts please). Sparing Amazon some of the blame, there's no reason the manufacturer couldn't include a couple fittings with the hose. The fittings are between 1 and 4 bucks at retail, so with a product of this price, the cost of the fittings shouldn't change much. Besides my wish fort fittings to be included, this is a fine hose."
3,"Works, but not the best.","This hose works, but it gets tankled and kinks up when you merely look at it. I'm constantly tripping over this thing, and coiling it at the end of a job is unnecessarily time consuming. The red rubber ones are better."
3,Good with some reservations,"""thadduesh"" makes some excellent observations about the referential gaps in this work. His evaluation is nothing short of brilliant and incisive. On a less substantive note, I would add only that the reference does not function very well as a teaching tool unless the student already has a solid basic understanding of grammar. The supplemental excersises help students identify problems but rarely provide enough practice and drill to correct them. In short, Hacker's work best serves the writer who arrives to it with only minor issues to address."
1,"Thanks, wrong book","Too bad that a site I clicked on that put me here said it was the third edition of A Writer's Referenece, the fourth edition won't do me much good, and now I have too of them. So, it wasn't so great."
4,Excellent book for those interested in the subject matter,"A very good book, although the introductory fiction is one of the worse pieces ever written for Ars Magica (it's too large and feels very artificial). Four types of hedge wizards are described: Cunning Folk, Spirit Masters, Natural Magicians and Ascetics. My favorites are the Spirit Masters and Natural Magicians, mainly because due to their presence the book also includes a very nice appendix detailing Items of Virtue (for the Natural Magicians) and some spirits (for Spirit Masters). The Cunning Folk are on the bottom of my list due to the inclusion of the totally unnecessary rules of wild vis.Be warned, though, that, if you're not intending to include any of the above four in your Saga, the only useful part of this book will be the appendix."
3,Came without Spray-nozzle,"This is a really great product, and works very well removing organic stains from inorganic material (e.g. barf from carpet).Picture of product shows it with a spray nozzle. I received it without the spray nozzle, which is a significant inconvenience."
3,"Love the look & feel, not impressed with durability","The rubberized case has a great feel and looks sharp; the durability isn't so hot. Scratches easily and the little piece around the charger port broke right away. But the RAZR isn't all that durable itself, so koodos for the nice looking case."
4,Communication Odysseys,They were on time with my book I was glad for that so I had it for the first day of school.
1,peice of crap,"I got this DVD player about a week ago. The first time I tried it, the thing worked fine, even though I only watched for 30 minutes. However, the next day I tried, (with a full battery), and the thing didn't work at all, it started fine, but within a couple minutes it started skipping and eventually, the screen went blue. Then I tried the peice of crap in the car with the cigarette outlet, once again it was fine for the first couple minutes, (during which time you could hardly see the screen, no matter what you changed with the brightness) then as usual the peice of crap DVD player just froze, and I was forced to turn it off, and return it. I strongly suggest nobody buys this peice of crap."
2,Audivox D1730 DVD Player,"Very good picture, comes with charger, litium ion battery, car adapter. However, right hinge cracked after very limited use. Warranty service only available in NY; thus, you must ship the player back for repair."
5,THIS IS A FANTASTIC PORTABLE PLAYER WITH FEATURES GALORE,"THIS PLAYER HAS A GOOD PICTURE AND SOUND.I PURCHASED THREE OF THESE,TO GIVE AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. HAS 3 HOUR BATTERY LIFE."
4,Audiovox D1730,"The picture and sound quality were great, but the sound is not loud enough to here when on an airplane. Sound is not loud enough."
3,Good picture - but some problems,"I purchased this unit primarily on spec and price. The 7"" display is bright, and DVDs play well. Unit is attractive and slim - easily carried, and just fits between the front arm rests on many cars so kids can see in the back - better than a fix-ed in car unit since you can also take it with on the plane/hotel/etc. Battery lasts for rated 3 hours - but is somewhat bulky.However after 4 months of ownership, I have noted 2 major problems.i) Unit can overheat when playing back DVDs - causing frame to freeze.ii) Screen hinge mechanism seems weak. One hinge already failed on my player, and the other is already cracking. We'll see how good the AudioVox warranty repair is.Overall, I'd look at the Panasonic or Pioneer models next time for a few $$ more, the hinges look more robust. Bigger than 7"" model may not fit in the car as well."
4,Nice DVD player,"We've owned this DVD player for about a year now and are very happy with it. We use it in the car on road trips, have taken it on an oversees plane trip and use it in our home. We've had no problems with it whatsoever. It does get pretty warm after it's been running for a while, but so far this has not affected its performance. The sound is sometimes not loud enough when using it in the car, but we solved this by bying a cassette adapter so the sound gets routed over the car stereo. I liked that this DVD player already came with the DC adapter cable for the car. We bought an extra battery for a 10-hour plane trip, which turned out to be unecessary, as they had DC hookups between the seats (on American Airlines) and we could have just powered it from that! Overall, we are very satisfied with this product and the low price. It does a great job of keeping the kids entertained on trips, and while at home we just plug it right into the TV."
4,Great Value but Fragile,"We bought two of these for our 5 & 8 year old sons. They are a life saver for travel. They have a great picture and good battery life. They include everything you need, even the DC adaptor for the car, which costs up to $... extra with other models. The only downside is the hinge design is not made to withstand any more than very careful use. Our 8 year old managed to break one of the hinges on his without really getting rough with it. It still works fine and we have glued it. Just be careful if younger kids are going to be using it. Of course, for the low price, you can just get another one if it gets really torn up. We bought two of these for less than one of some similar models we looked at."
3,Ok but.....,"This is an okay player, especially at this lower price. Just be aware that our battery lasted only 1.5 years before it would not hold a charge and over time, the unit makes a grinding noise. A replacement battery costs about $75.00+ from Audiovox and to have the unit cleaned/repaired would cost about $95.00. At that point, it's cheaper to just buy a new unit."
2,CONSTANT TROUBLE,"We have had this unit for less than 2 years. After a few months use the screen went black.....you had audio but no video. I had to box it up and send it to NY, after several weeks we were sent a refurbished unit, but they did not return the cigerett adapter. I called them and got no where except to be told that i could order another one from them for $35I have had this ""refurbished"" unit for a few months and it is now doing the same thing as the first one. All in all we have used this unit only on trips. Total hours ever used since purchasing the first one would not exceed 10 movies on the two combined.I would NOT recommend buying this unit, thier support is lousy and it is very unreliable even if you can get it to work. Freezing up is another story in itself......"
4,he is not a clown with the big floppy shoes!,"This CD is a verry funny compilation of prank calls made to businessesm organisations and any everyday people. He asks outrageous questions and makes fools out of the people he calls. You probably think it is just another comedy album, but buy it and see for your self that he is a greek legend!"
4,Do Not Talk Over Me,"I would rate this album for comedy 4 stars !I recommend this album to everyone who likes a laugh.If you buy this album you willn't regret it.Plumber,Queen and the National Park are the greatest calls ever."
1,Terrible,"This pillow is way too soft! My baby sinks into it and it provides no support. At first I thought maybe my daughter was too little, she was about 7 pounds when I first used the pillow. Now she is over 13 pounds and still sinks into it. It was a complete waste of money. Don't waste yours!"
2,Not comfortable!,"I thought it was going to be a great help but the thing slips away from your body and it doesn't work, at least not the way my baby nurses. Not all babies are comfortable laying perfectly perpendicular to your body, it's hard to get ""tummy to tummy"" that way. The sides should be longer so that it actually wraps around the waist. Maybe using a non-slip cover would be better but still..."
1,Does not fit!!!,"The baby kept falling between me and the pillow. It does not match with my body, I am thin person and I really can't use it in any way. Money throwed away."
2,"If you think it's as good as a boppy, it's not","I got this because I felt like the boppy pillow was way too expensive. This pillow really can't be considered a nursing pillow, especially for moms nursing right after having the baby. The arms are so short that it doesn't go past your post-pregnancy belly, and doesn't give you any support for your arms at all. I found that it would slide off of my lap and was just a waste of time. It ended up as just a place for the cats to sleep. Also just an awful horrible idea to not have removable covers, but the one redeeming quality is that you could shove it in the washing machine and it would come out undamaged"
3,cool but slides,This is a very nice soft pillow. I loved using it to nurse when my baby was very small. Although I attached my elastic pregnancy belly support band on the two sides so it would hold it close to my body. It worked wonderfully like that. Otherwise I always felt like it was sliding away from me.
3,overpriced,"the right shape, the right firmness, and i thought the price was right. however after 7 weeks of light use, the pillow already has a hole in it, where the cover pulled apart at the seams. the fabric and stitching just aren't durable. combine that with the fact that the cover isn't removable for cleaning, and definitely not stain-resistant, what you really have here is an overpriced throw pillow.if i had it to do over, i would have bought another my brest friend pillow (which wasn't perfect either, but was MUCH more durable)."
4,EXCELLENT OI !/MELODIC 80'S HC PUNK,"Of a very particular kind. This unique sounding collection features over an hour of the most original and fresh sounding 80's hardcore punk. Massive choruses in atypical non-oi, no-singalong fashion, a lead singer with a gravelly voice, powerful,highly skilled two-guitar arrangements with plenty of metally/rock'n roll solos and machine gun drumming, this collection of the self titled lp + a lot of 7 ''and demos covering the 82 - 98 ! period starts out in what reminds a little of Bad Religion but rapidly develops into a speedy melodic mayhem of unrelentless heaviness. The sound leaves a lot to be wished in the upper treble department but the music more than makes up for it. A CRIMINALLY underrated brit-punk band hailing from the early 80's."
3,Warm-Up,"OK - I just listened to the album and by the time it got to the last song, Matthew's wonderful ""weisselklenzenacht"", I said to myself hey the band just got cookin' and now it's all over? Well my suggestion to the group is why stop now when everybody's warmed up and the juices are starting to flow. I can't wait another 12 years for another spin of the ignition, so let's get going with another recording session and let the band advance into full throttle before we lose this special energy."
2,well's on fire,"I was disappointed by this latest release from Procal Harum. They were one of my favorite bands quite awhile ago; their Felt Forum appearance magnificent.Although Gary Brooker still has a great voice and soulful piano playing, most of the music sounds generic and the lyrics mostly bland. As I listen to this CD I am wanting Reid to go further with his lyrics rather than staying in a safe mediocre zone. He is capable of brilliance as are Fisher and Brooker."
5,"Super recording, but read this","Wonderful record! It's quite a bit more consciously engineered to sound like their classic 1970's sound than Prodigal Stranger was. (They MUST be asking their current guitarist to sound like Robin Trower??) On the other hand, no attempt by Brzezicki to sound like dear departed Barrie Wilson. The songwriting as always is great.Yes, the recording's absolutely great, and will please Procol fans, I believe. It's also a novelty to hear 1960's icon band PH singing topical songs (September 11, Wall Street Crash, etc). It's a bit like seeing Dwight Eisenhower on Nightline."
2,must be better choices,"The chemical smell from this pad was so bad on arrival I had to store it outside. The fumes dissipated in roughly a month, but after two months the pad has hardened somewhat, so that it does not grip very well. It's now adequate for sanding, but not for routing."
5,A jazz vocal classic in the swingin' tradition...,"Keely Smith's velevety smooth voice, backed by fresh and jazzy arrangements in the tradidion of Nelson Riddle. Smith sings timeless jazz standards such as Errol Garner's Misty, with ease and a highly appealing sense of jazz phrasing. Excellent CD, essentail for fans of 50'd jazz vocal albums."
2,Keely Smith's gorgious voice with a cheesy orchestra...,"Billy Vaughan the ""king of cheesy listening"" arranged this awful LP(re-issued on CD) with Keely Smith's sweet and gorgious phrasing, however all of Keely's jazz influenced singing doesn't make the awful arrangemnets go away. Wait a couple of months for Collectors Choice which is going to re-issie her two best LP's on one CD ""Swingin' Pretty"" with Nelson Riddle's swingin' arrangements and ""Politely"" with Billy May's jazzy arrangements, or if you can't wait try Capital's spotlight on great ladies of song."
5,Love it!,YOu have to move fast with this one. Lots of coordination and variety. One of my favorites!
1,MOSAIC TOME OF MYSTERY,"THIS GAME IS NOT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT, GOOD IF YOU ARE WANTING TO KILL SOME TIME"
1,marketing REAL people choices,"I received this book in bad conditions.It was wet and its pages show fungus.I think the half of the book got wet. Please it is the opportunyty to complain and request change for other in better conditions because I paid for something used but not damaged.Thanks,Luis Montoya"
4,A good source of information,"This book has a lot of examples of products that we usually know, so it is easily to understand the concepts."
2,Should be the 100 sales questions,"Although redundancy helps you remember the point, the title is misleading. It is more like 100 questions and 3 or more ways to ask the same question. (maybe I'm being unfair....it may be 101, but it may only be 98 as well).Best for the salesperson who is in a slump, a s it's a nice refresher. May not be helpful to a newbie, who needs more confidence than robotics."
2,Not my style,"Though I am an avid Packer fan and actually a fan of Ron Wolf's, I was a bit disappointed in the book ""The Packer Way"". Not so much in that it was poorly written, (though the writing was sub par) but more in the ""I'm the tough guy, you should be too"" style that weaves through the book. The history offered on the making of the championship team was great, but the self agrandizement that came along with each nugget was more than I'd hoped for. This may be a decent biography of a man I want running my football team, but not as my boss. It is not, however, a worth while management book on how to run or improve one's own business. Unless you want to be the guy that no one wants to work for."
1,Bought it for my husband,He knew Ron Wolf personally and he enjoyed the book. He is a great fan of army football and he worked for the NFL
3,"Good book, but ...","Wolf gives some very, very good advice. However, he does miss the big picture on many issues. A much better book on this same idea-line is MBA (Management by Auerbach), written by Celtic legend Red Auerbach.This book also is hindered by ""Trumpishness."" If you recall, Donald Trump went bankrupt after his best-selling ""Trump: The Art of the Deal."" Here, the Packers are playing Bears-level football, which may take away some of Wolf's lasting credibility!"
3,Hard nosed business,"Ron Wolf communicates a management philosophy that is no nonsense, results based and relies on individual accountability. Whether your a football fan or not, as a business manager you will take away some positive insight into producing and managing a winning team."
3,An 8-8 season as a publication,"Depending upon what you wish to get from this book, you will be relatively pleased and equally displeased. Unfortunately, there's too much of Wolf's self-congratulation throughout.There are some interesting insights into the Packer's assembly of its late 90s' teams and some transferable recommendations about managing organizations. Too much repetition makes the book a bit diluted.I cannot really recommend it to any but the true Packer junkies, of which I am one."
1,Be Real,"These Packers won only one Super Bowl and Wolf considers himself to be a management guru. The year this book came out, The Packers lost a wild card game on the road!!! The next year, Wolf's last, they did'nt even make the playoffs!!! At the end of this book, you'll find out something very interesting about Wolf. He has a severely broken hand-FROM CONSTANTLY PATTING HIMSELF ON THE BACK......"
2,too small,"it is possible too fit my gun in this case, only if I take off barrel. The company selling this item did not put the dimensions in the info. I need 40"" long gun case and this one is 27""."
2,Questionable Quality,"Item was received in a thin, torn cardboard box. Amazon was selected as the vendor (there are many online for this item)based on overall cost (free shipping). Item had a bent rear lid and hinge. The welds in the aluminum were cracked or simply not holding two edges together in several places. This item says it was manufactured in Arkansas - not China. Shameful quality. I was going to return it, but shipping was $92.06 - which Amazon refunded so I could make repairs myself."
3,Key blank problem,"Although Amazon is hard to beat on prices, O'Reilly Auto Parts saved me $45.00 on this item. Couldn't find a key blank locally, Delta has a special blank so they can send you two replacement keys for $10.12. You can get a new Cam Lock and two extra keys cut at Ace Hardware for 30 cents more. It only took 15 minutes to change out the cam lock with a 7/8"" box end wrench and a hack saw to trim pivoting bar. If you ever need a replacement key, you can have another cut anywhere and do not have to wait for a mail shipment.Susanville, Ca."
2,A big disappointment,"The idea behind this book was great: pick some of the more interesting specimens out of the thousands held at the Harvard Museum of Natural History & write the story behind each. Alas, the outcome is boring & unimaginative. Most accounts are simplistic & unsophisticated. Moreover, the photos of many specimens were taken on distracting backgrounds such as human hands, maps, notebooks, etc. I am glad I bought a cheap secondhand copy."
1,ps... the better NDE book for children who are dying is...,"The Door to the Secret City (The Adventures of Freddie, No. 1) by Kathleen J. Forti, James Brisson (Illustrator), Dutton Childrens Books (October 1984), ISBN: 0913299103Oops, I forgot to add my recommendation for a better alternative book for kids facing life-limiting and life-threatening illness, as well as for their siblings and friends. This story completely transcends it's publication date (1984) making it a timeless NDE children's classic. :o) My sons enjoyed listening to the tape version of this book until they were pre-teens when they began reading adult NDE narratives. If the tape is not availlable at Amazon, check for it at www.IANDS.org."
1,Defective color cartridge - don't order,"I ordered this item earlier this year from ""Abacus."" It worked okay for about a week (i.e., a few printed pages), after which the colors began to have a washed-out appearance. Avoid this seller/cartridge."
5,compatible dell ink cartridge,I was told by several people and Dell that you could not use anything but a Dell Cartridge. When I received the compatible cartridge I want everyone to know that it saved me several dollars and has worked as well as not better than the Dell product. I will buy all future cartridges from them.
4,good seller,Dell Ink Cartridges For Dell A920 & 720 Printers - Price Includes Black & Color Package Of 2 Ink Cartridges - Remanufactured T0529 & T0530very good...work the first time and no problems at all
5,this one made me cry,"""mr. putter and tabby fly the plane"" made me cry. i love what happens to the special needs boy! all baby boomers should enjoy this old man who loves toys.so cynthia rylant is my new favorite author, she clearly has my old fashioned values. LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!"
5,Perfeclty sweet,"My daughter (just turned 4) and I are big fans of Mr. Putter and Tabby. The books are sweet and gently humorous. One nice thing about them is that even though they are written for kids, they are about elderly people (and their eldery pets) -- a perspective you don't get from most children's literature. ""Fly the Plane"" in particular reminds the reader of that, as Mr. Putter gets to live a childhood fantasy, and then pass on his gift to a little boy. It works on several levels: my daughter thought it was a cute story; I found it incredibly poignant."
5,The 1st real jazz singer of the 20's...,"Annette Hanshaw was just about the only female vocalist(not including classic blues moaners like Bessie Smith) that was really singing jazz in the 20's, the only other was Ethel Waters. Hanshaw would improvise, scat, and swing, backed by only the finest jazz musicians of the time, and since Hanshaw came from a wealthy family and was already quite wealthy herself, she could hire the finest jazz players like Manny Klein, Joe Venuti, The Memphis Five, Dorsey Brothers, and essentailly had the same backup groups that the Boswell Sisters had, in the 30's. Due to Hanshaw's wealth she did not have to record pop tunes like Ruth Etting, or Kate Smith, she chose herself what she would record so it's all jazz, and in fun. She retired in the early 30's unfortionately. This CD is a nice overview of her recordings from the 20's. Highly recommended."
4,ANNETTE'S FORMATIVE YEARS,"This compilation features a selection of Annette Hanshawe's earliest recordings, made between late 1926 and mid 1928, at which point she was five months off her eighteenth birthday! It's thus an invaluable acquisition for any serious collector of this period in general, and Miss Hanshaw in particular. The liner note is fairly brief, and although passing mention is made of the various musicians who accompanied her, I wish more effort had been made to identify them properly to each track, all of information is freely available elsewhere."
3,For those to whom the bluebook remains a mystery,"I agree with the comments of the reviewer below pertaining to italics over underlining. See infra review of Thomas Blackwell. However, this book will not be very helpful to most users of the bluebook. The book is very, very brief and contains nothing not contained in the bluebook itself. Further, the index of the bluebook allows easy location of the applicable rules for even the most obscure of situations. This very short book merely reiterates that which is already contained in the bluebook, I would only recommend this book to the truly bluebook clueless."
4,A good companion to the Blue Book,I've recommended this as a supplementary text for my legal writing classes for several years now. Dworsky provides good additional commentary on the otherwise opaque rules of the BlueBook. My only complaint is that he favors underlining over italics for case citations; my experience is that most attorneys now prefer italics.
3,"Bluebook, italics, and underlining","I agree with the previous reviewers concerning this book. The issue of italics vs. underlining may be controversial, but I think most courts and most attorneys favor underlining; I know I do. In fax transmissions, underlining shows up much better. Also, underlined cases and emphases are much easier to spot when reading a legal brief or memorandum."
2,Unnecessary,"It's not as though the book got any of the Bluebooking rules wrong, to my memory, it's just that you should probably invest in a proper Bluebook anyways. For me, the summing-it-up sections in the Bluebook did a better job of getting me the specific certain chunks of information, like useful examples, more quickly than this book did. I'd recommend just skipping this one, and if you're ever really stuck, just doing a Google search for helpful examples (especially if you're already using the normal journal-type Bluebook rules rather than the blue-pages front section)."
5,Bluebook,"Very Helpful. When I couldn't easily find guidance in the Bluebook, I would turn to the User's Guide, and it would often provide me with further guidance."
2,Disappointed,I was so disappointed in this item. It was shabbily put together and had vocal that was not advertised. I bought it as PIANO boogie.
2,Slippin' N Slidin',"The handles are too small and slippery when you get blood on your hands. I feed my dog raw chicken, turkey and duck and to do so I have to cut up it into smaller pieces before I freeze them. A regular scissors type handle would be a better design. Also the shears seem to handle the bone okay but not the skin. It appears the blades have too much play in them. I will be buying a new pair of Gerber game shears to replace my old pair of Gerbers."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I bought these game shears because I feed birds at a wildlife rescue park. This involves cutting up mice, rats, quail, rabbits etc. The shears were great at first but the spring action stopped working well very quickly -- that makes the shears almost useless. I send for a free replacement and the company responded quickly, but the same thing happened. I have stopped using them."
2,if you like scratches...,"ok performance, but the protective layer is not put on completely centered leaving exposed metal (I have recieved 2). I got a number of scratches on my trunk. I believe that I will order a k30 or k40. I am using some electrical tape to provide protection in the interim, hopefully the adhesive doesn't run in the sun."
4,very pleased,I was very pleased with the service. I received the purchase promptly and it was definitely in the condition advertised.Thanks.
4,UFO makin' moves!,"UFO are still kings of melodic hard rock. They wereignored when Schenker left but Paul Chapman proved that hewas worth the job and this live disc shows how powerful andgood they still were! This rocks just as much as Strangers andand real UFO fan would love it! No Place To Run rocks and if""the boss"" had released it, it would've been a massive hit!This is a great live album and highly recommended."
2,Degenerator!,"This recording is deeply flawed, both in sound quality and performance quality. Chapman did an admirable job taking over from Schenker on No Place to Run, and even Wild, Willing, & Innocent had some decent songs. But by this time, the band was running on fumes (high-proof, at that). The result is uninspired, muddy, and downright embarassing at times. Chapman's inability to string together a memorable hook or melody in his awful improvised solos is painful to experience. I remember seeing the band at this time, and even then, at the gullible age of 17, I knew I wasn't seeing a tight group. Pete Way was visibly plastered (when isn't he, I guess?), Chapman and Mogg only marginally less so.Frankly, this one's forgettable, as was this entire stage of the band. Don't waste your money."
3,it's more than what you pay for,I bought this corner chisel a month ago with high expectations of it. The product does exactly what it says it does with the exception of it's dimensions. the base is roughly 1-1/16 square which renders it useless for any thing other than strike plates. still not a bad tool just disappointing
3,Grizzly Corner Chisel,"Product works as advertised, but seems to be very dull out of the box. It wants to break the wood in the corner instead of make the nice corner cut. Could probably be remedied with a sharpening but its a little disappointing. Also I figured it would work for hinges and rounded strike plates for door hardware. Its hard to wedge into the corner of most doors and jams to made corner chisel for harddware."
4,Price is right,"For what I paid, I am well pleased. The construction is rugged and can take repeated hits from a hammer all day long. The corner chisel blade could stand a sharpening out of the box (which isnt all that easy to do). Still, a great little tool to bring with you for cleaning up corners of door hinge mortises."
3,Flawed but fun game,"This game looked at first to be a Diablo clone, but has some fun differences that make it worth buying. In the game you control 3 characters at different times (a barbarian, an amazon, and a sorceress), and go on different quests with each. You choose your quests on a map, with each territory containing a different quest. The characters start on different places on the map, and so have differently arranged ""trees"" of quests. There are several other fun additions to gameplay, such as sneaking, and monster field of vision. However, the walking animations look choppy, the voices are a little bit fast, and there are occasional glaring mispellings. Overall, it's a fun game with fairly low production values."
4,Does the Job,Paid a little more to get it a few days earlier and it arrived on time. The bigger one I had fell and broke so I choose the cheaper one this time. It does the job.
1,Bad design- Do not buy PUR CR-6000 water pitcher,"PUR CR-6000 2-Stage Oval-Shaped Water-Filtration PitcherFollowing the instruction, I filled the pitcher and poured the first glass of water. The pitcher cracked. As I observed it, the pitcher body cracked where the top of the handle is attached. No wonder! That is exactly where the highest stress will be when you tilt the pitcher to pour. The handle could be attached an inch, or even an half inch, below the edge of the body to strengthen it. Do not buy this item as it will not serve you too long."
2,Flimsy pitcher.,The pitcher is flimsy. The lid (even more flimsy) was cracked when it arrived. I'm just using the inner filter part and keeping the water in a large glass jar. The filter part works quite well.
2,Filthy dirty filter,"I haven't tried this pitcher yet, but I HAVE to comment immediately. The filter that goes INSIDE the pitcher (so immersed in all the water my family drinks) came out of the foil wrap FILTHY DIRTY. There were fingerprints on it!!! My hand to God! Also, white flecks of something and what appears to be some kind of greasy dirt. I'm horrified. I'm not even sure if washing it with hot soapy water is allowed/acceptable. I need to do some online research. Disgusting. Idk if there is some sterilization step that was missed at the factory or what. The foil was sealed shut so whatever happened, happened at the factory. I'll have to update this review and let you know what I think of the pitcher if I decide the filter can be cleaned."
1,Pitcher cracked after two months use,"Bought new, used two months, placed in fridge to keep water cool. Crack developed from just below the spout all the way down the side of the pitcher. Discovered when cleaning up a large puddle of water on the floor in front of the fridge.Don't buy this product. Get something better made."
4,Great and Not So Great,PUR CR-6000 7-Cup Water Filtration PitcherThis PUR CR-6000 7-Cup Water Filtration Pitcher works Great...Super. (An 5 rating) We have sediment and a horrid smell in our city water because of the drought low/hot water lake problems.The pitcher fell to the floor out of the box and the plastic lid shattered into little pieces.(a crack maybe would get a 3 rating but 5 or more pieces gets a 0 rating !) I do not want to send it back because it is not the sellers fault and I do not want to go without this great filter. So the pitcher sits un-damaged from its fall and lidless on the counter.... BUT we are no longer gagging when we lift a cup or glass to our face. It is great! Wish I could have given it a 5
4,Works great!,Works great and does its job. Plus it fits really well into my fridge which is always kind of cramped.
5,best tasting water ever!,This purifing system really does work. You will find yourself drinking more water and enjoying it more!
5,Pur CR-6000 2 Stage Oval Water Pitcher,The PUR water filtration pitcher really works. The filtered water tastes much better than plain tap water. There is also a noticeable improvement in the taste of coffee and tea prepared with PUR filtered water.
1,what about arsenic and flouride?,"removes only a small portion of the harmful contaminates, flouride is deadly! it is meant to go ON teeth for solidifying/strengthening enamel, not in the blood (and on to the brain)."
1,Crummy and cracked,This pitcher ARRIVED cracked!!!It also smells..that stench that plastic products oozenow-a-days.and looking at how flimsy it is made no surprise!Had a PUR pitcher for YEARSand loved it...this new oneis clearly a de-evolution of the product.Thank God Amazon takes crud like thisback...
2,It arrived cracked and so it leaked water,I'd of sent it back but it was easier to simply replace it at Wall-Mart
4,good but slow,"This unit purifies water quite well but it is a little slow. Maybe it has to be that way to clean the water as well as it does. You also have to prep the cartridges before using them which, to me, is odd but again maybe its worth it to get really clean water. The list of contaminates that these filters remove is large. i would buy it again but i just cant give it a 5."
5,Way better than Britta,"Prior to purchasing the Pur filter pitcher, we used a similar Brita pitcher. While the Brita was much faster, it routinely dispensed flecks of charcoal into the filtered water and did a very poor job of filtering out the chlorine taste from the tap water.While the Pur Filter Pitcher takes its own sweet time filtering, the results are amazing -- every bit as good as the best bottled water."
2,Filters clog up after 10 days,"I bought the pitcher version although I have very clean water, did it to get the fluoride taste out. After 2 weeks, nothing running through. Called Pur, they promised me a filter replacement coupon, and sent me a 2 for 1 instead. Bought new filter, clogged up again after only 10 days. Are they trying to fraud people into buying a new filter every 2 weeks? I had the faucet version, too, for over 6 years, and it holds up to 6 months. What is going on here?"
4,Very nice -- but the pouring handle is wimpy,Nice color -- looks inviting -- filters well -- holds a good quantity of water -- there are only two things I don't like:1) the handle is wimpy - give us a handle that's a little chunkier2) the pouring lip is not covered -- any little gnat ot piece of dust can fly into the pitcher via this lip -- I solved the problem by sliding a smll plastic sandwich bag over the removable top of the pitcher so that the end of the bag extends over and covers the pouring lip. Not the most elegant solution but it sure works.Can the PUR filters be RECYCLED? I hope so.
1,I hope you have time on your hands!,"My family has used a Pur pitcher for at least a decade (and a Brita before that) and lately I just got fed up with the Pur. The last 2 filters we bought are so slow to filter the water, sometimes it sits in the top for hours. Then when you forget to wait and try to pour, the lid pops off and water spills everywhere. A waste of time and money. You should try the Clear2O Premium Water Filtration Pitcher, it's perfect!"
4,This is a SMALL Pitcher,"Pur filters are great, just FYI - they're not kidding when it says""Holds 7 8-ounce cups""My fault really, I was looking for a 2-4 liter pitcher, which my friend had, and it looked exactly like the picture on the box, but in reality this is less than 2 liters.I wish they would put the size by liters instead of cups. Each time I use it, I have to refill. Kinda annoying..But other than the size you can't go wrong with a Pur filter."
4,crisp and fresh water!,"How do you rate a product that purifies water exactly? Well all I can say is that it works. It's a little slow to filter, but the end result is crisp tasteless water. I keep it at my cubicle and I never have to buy bottled water. For me it's a good investment."
3,"Water great, pitcher terrible","I can't understand why this company hasn't come up with a better pitcher after all this time. The big refrigerator thing is too long for my sub-zero and a pain to fill. The regular pitcher is too small for a big family. Come on PUR- you've got the best filter, the water is outstanding but the pitcher just isn't so good."
2,Water tastes strange,"I followed the instructions for cleaning the pitcher and filter before using it. The water tasted strange. I tried re-cleaning. The water still tasted strange. Even after many uses, the water still tasted strange. I am ready to give up on this product."
5,Perfect Water,Excellent product - no more running to the windmills @ $0.25 per gal plus auto gasoline costs & wear & tear on the auto.
4,Good Filter and the Samples were a plus!,Bought this filter for my husband. He likes to use the filtered water for making his expresso in the morning. Haven't had to purchase a new filter yet. Although it takes some time to filter the water. Seems to work just as described and it definitely was a good value.
4,Great Water Filter,"The water filter makes the water taste nice and fresh. It was also a good deal, especially considering the price of bottled water."
2,Poor quality,"Although I love the filtration system, the plastic pitcher is poor quality. I have a pitcher from about 6 years ago which still works great and is very sturdy. I bought this one last summer to take on a cruise. After I received it, I immediately noticed that this one is half the weight and the plastic so thin, I decided to pack my old one for the cruise and leave this one home. Within 2 weeks the new one (which I keep on my kitchen counter) developed a large crack in the inside ""blue"" part. It was almost like it couldn't handle the weight of the water. It was never dropped or bumped. Very disappointed with this."
2,not as good as the older model,"The opening (for water to come out) has no cover like the older model that I have. The clear container is not as strong, don't know how long it will last. Reduced cost and reduced quality. Bought it for the trial samples that worth a few bucks."
4,"Saves money so far, but unsure of costs of filters.","I need to have a gallon of filtered water every day and this product has been great so far. I am hoping that I find that the refills of the filters (30 gallon limit) is reasonable in cost and ease of access. If so, this is a great thing when you are on an HCG diet or just want great, filtered water that is easy to use..."
4,better than expected,"I honestly didn't think I would like this product, since I haven't been happy with filtered water pitchers before. But I bought it anyway, at least partly for the doo-dads that come with it, and I have been pleasantly surprised. My wife and I have been using it for a month now, and we've been able to quit buying bottled water, simply refilling the bottles from the pitcher instead. Surprisingly, the result is cold bottled water almost indistinguishable from the full-priced product. I expected that nasty filter aftertaste, but I don't notice anything at all--just cold water. It's not like we're saving thousands of dollars, since bottled water is getting pretty cheap, but when you can't tell the difference, why pay for the packages and have to lug them around the store? Tap water is virtually free, and filtered through this pitcher, it tastes just like the bottled water. (Believe it or not.)"
4,Good tasting water..,"I purchased this pitcher and a ""stainless steel"" water bottle, but the bottle wasn't anything like what was advertised, so Amazon removed the bottle from their website and gave me a refund.But, the pitcher does deliver great filtered water. My wife receives free Dasani purified water at work, but prefers the water filtered by this pitcher. So, she fills those empty bottles with ""our"" water and carries them to work or when she is out shopping.I'm a big coffee drinker, and using the water from this pitcher makes the coffee taste much better and less acidic.Now, if I could just get a good promotional price on replacement filters, the deal would be more than perfect."
2,Pur filter is slow,"This tiny pitcher takes over 8 hours sometimes to filter a load of water.It gets a bonus star because I can pour it while it's still filtering, by holding the lid down with my hand.EDIT 11-28-2007:I bought a replacement Pur filter at Target. This one has a hole in the top of it that is supposed to improve water flow, and it sure does -- I can get two 8oz glasses of water out of it in less than 5 mins. I hope it's filtering properly, at that speed (it does taste good). So I'll leave my review at 2 stars until it becomes apparent that this pitcher is shipping with the improved filter, rather than the old slow one."
1,Pitcher Cracked,I agree with a previous reviewer - the pitcher fractured spontaneously. It was not dropped or hit - it just ruptured and leaked water all over. I would not buy another PUR product. It was a 2-4-1 deal at a local grocery store - now I know why......
2,"Particles left in ""Filtered Water"" - Worse Taste","After following the presoaking instructions for the filter, the filter deposited many black particles, as well as tiny translucent spheres in the ""filtered"" water. Even more, the ""filtered"" water tastes worse than straight tap water from the facet! I live in AZ where the tap water is notoriously bad. Unfortunately, going to return this filter, possibly shop for another brand."
5,Love it. Exactly what I was looking for.,"I absolutely love this water filter. I have disgusting tasting, foggy city water, and after this pitcher filters my water, it is completely clear and tastes wonderful. I am 100% satisfied. Extremely easy to assemble, and I like the filter replacement guide on the side to help remind you when to change the filter. I had no problems with the lid falling off when pouring or the unfiltered water pouring out with the filtered water. The water seems to filter extremely quickly. I can fill the top part almost all the way full, and it will be completely filtered in 15-20 minutes. I am buying another pitcher for my mom because it is such a reasonably priced, useful, high quality product."
2,A useless thing,"Perhaps this filter makes water healthier. Perhaps. What I can tell is that it doesn't make it taste better. The water that I get out of this filter is slightly on the bitter side, and tastes far worse than bottled water. I can't really drink it.Other uses? I had an idea of using filtered water for cooking, but it turned out to be impossible because this filter just doesn't produce it quick enough. Other reviewers mentioned mentioned the speed issue, but I couldn't understand what they are talking about before actually buying the thing. What happens is that if you fill it with water for the first time in the morning, the first pint gets filtered pretty quickly, in a couple minutes. The second pint takes longer, and getting the third pint takes about an hour. In the end, when you start cooking, you can't have enough water within a reasonable time.The bottom line is that the filter can't be returned so I'll keep it, but I wish I spent the money on something else."
5,LOVE IT,This pitcher really makes a difference in water taste. Other family members are planning on purchasing one after drinking this filtered water.
3,water filtration pitcher,"this water filtration is very useful and good for you health too. but when you first brought this item you should clean it very hardly because it still dirty when you first open it up. so be prepare of that, after that you are good to go. Thank you!"
2,Still overflows,I had a bigger version of the PUR pitcher which overflowed in the refrigerator. I bought this one and it does the same thing.
4,"Very pleased with purchase, good purchase","Currently in my second year of college and living in an older building, so I am limited in ways to get water besides from the sink. Went ahead and purchased this PUR filter pitcher and I am very pleased with this purchase as my drinking water now tastes great. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I have to refill it more often than wanted (1 or 2 times per day), but doing so is an easy task."
4,Does the job,"I couldn't decide between the Brita Slim Pitcher and the Pur Oval, so bought one of each. And that's not as frivolous as it sounds, because I wanted two anyway so there would always be a cold one ready in the fridge. Both of them seem to filter the water just fine. The Brita top stays on better, but the handle has sharper edges and is less comfortable to hold, especially when it's full. Although I've noticed the little black specks that others have objected to, in our case they stay in the top section and never end up in the glass, so they don't bother us. The Pur has a nicer, rounded handle, but if you're not careful the top has a tendency to fall off, dumping water all over the shelf. No worries, though, because if you just make sure to use two hands and hold the top securely, which is very easy to do, it stays where it belongs and all is well. So, bottom line, I would give maybe a slight edge to the Pur, but either one delivers good-tasting water with a minimum of fuss."
4,No cracks yet,"Ever since moving into a big city and bereft of a car, I can no longer purchase water by the bulk... gallon jugs and stacks of water bottles are much to heavy to carry for blocks on end. The PUR water filtration device saves me from this predicament. But that is not the only thing it saves:1. Saves money - I can use a filter and drink as much water as my heart and blood and other bodily functions desire for two months.2. Saves environment - No more plastic bottles in the landfill.3. Saves time - No market trips just to buy water. No endless trips to the trash disposal to discard plastic bottles.On top of this, the water tastes fine. You may want to pair this with a Klean Kanteen (whatever it is called) for endless water pleasures.Note: My pitcher has not cracked yet after several months of use. I hope it never does. Your mileage may vary."
4,Filtration Pitcher,I works fine and I am happy with it. I Would recommend it to a friend as it is easy to use.James D Mack
5,Handy !,"I have been saving money on bottled water because of PUR. Its a good thing as long as the filter quality meets the standards of a bottled water or atleast takes out chlorine, and tap water smell. So far, ITS DOING THAT. Love it !"
4,Good Pitcher,Fills faster than the Brita and the water comes out tasting good. Wish it were a little bigger - but not a big deal. Would buy it again if I need another.
4,water filter pitcher,Had other PUR pitchers b4 but its the low price and no electronic time usage light that attracted my eye as I was ordering refill filters for my other pitcher. The only draw back is there isn't any flip cover for the spout so you need to plug it yourself so nothing falls (or crawls) into the filtered resevoir. Otherwise very happy with product.
5,Love It,"We were spending a fortune on 1.5 liter bottles, literally buying by them by case. Had used a Brita pitcher years ago, and hated the taste. Pur is far better (though it took some getting used to after Evian.) Haven't had any problems with the unit, or with replacing the filters. Very straightforward, and fairly solid. We have to refill several times a day, and change the filter monthly. Small fridge, so we can't fit the larger dispenser. It feels great knowing our water is clean & safe AND that we're no longer generating a ton of plastic garbage. Highly recommended!"
5,WOW! I just love this pitcher!,"For years, I've been lugging bottles of water (mostly distilled) so that I can avoid weird water tastes, cloudy water and mystery pollution floating in it. Well, I guess I'm about to miss out on all those great work-outs I've been doing. There'll be no more heavy lifting for me or squandering tons of money (it really adds up!) on bottled water. I can also congratulate myself on sparing the environment all those plastic jugs in the trash.PUR CR-600 2 Stage Oval Water Pitcher is excellent, efficient and cost-effective. The pitcher, itself, is quite sturdy. I've been using this pitcher for weeks now, and I'm certain that it will last a good long time. I highly recommend it and only wish I had purchased one years ago!"
4,Pur Water Filter,"Decent filter, inexpensive. Water in San Diego has lots of ""interesting"" flavors and the filter gets rid of most of them."
5,10 Sermons on the Second Advent,"I really enjoy E.W. Bullinger's work and this one here is a must have!Bible study is an ongoing ever evolving entity in my opinion, so I use a lotof reference material and weigh them against the scriptures of the KJV bible.In this way I can understand God's word as he would have me to understand it andhow much of it for that matter.There is no man on earth who knows all the answers, so we must Study (for ourselves), to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.II Timothy 2:15"
1,CHEAP CATWOMAN COSTUME WILL TEAR APART AT ALL SEAMS,"I purchased this item initially on eBay, but returned it due to it ripping at all of the seams. I thought that they had sold me a second or irregular costume.I purchased the item again from a reputable costume store. The very same thing happened. The costume materials are so cheap that the thread rips the material with any type of movement. Even just putting the costume on can create tears. The materials is just falling apart at all of the seams. Also, the costume runs very small. My daughter normally wears a size 6, but the M(8-10) just fits her.Rubies has always made great costumes, but I must say that this one is the pits! It can only be worn one or two times ):This was very disheartening to my 6YO Catwoman Fan! It made me sad as well to see her so disappointed. I wish that I would have never shown her the costume."
4,Great for Halloween,"This was a great choice for Halloween. I bought a 10-12 based on other reviewer's comments about the sizing running small, and I really should have just bought a 7-8, which is what my daughter actually wears. We had to pin the costume in the back to get the sleek ""cat woman"" look, which was very important to her. The mask is probably the best component of the whole costume - it allows for very fun catwoman eye shadow for 9 year olds who don't normally get to wear make-up!"
1,VERY CHEAPLY MADE CATWOMAN COSTUME DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this item initially on eBay, but returned it due to it ripping at all of the seams. I thought that they had sold me a second or irregular costume.I purchased the item again from a reputable costume store. The very same thing happened. The costume materials are so cheap that the thread rips the material with any type of movement. Even just putting the costume on can create tears.

It can only be worn one or two times ):This was very disheartening to my 6YO Catwoman Fan! It made me sad as well to see her so disappointed. I wish that I would have never shown her the costume."
2,Undersized,"A previous review of this product made us aware of the fact that the seams would need to be replaced on this product (and they did, the material was very poorly attached). We were disappointed that the sizing ran to the small side, nearly 2 inches smaller than advertised. We measured our granddaughter and bought according to her measurments but the suit was very tight on the arms and legs. So, when my wife reinforced the seams, she did so after adding a strip to the arms and legs to make the costume big enough for our granddaughter to wear comfortably. So, be prepared to reinforce the seams and order a size larger than you think you are going to need."
3,"Great collection, but no active table of contents for Kindle","A great collection of sermons, so I have no problem with content. But Kindle users beware: there is no linked table of contents, so you have to click through each sermon and highlight or mark the beginning of each one to find them later. Terrible idea to format this wonderful book for Kindle and then fail to add an active table of contents. Dumb."
2,Limited Help,"This book was a disapointment, as it contained lots of pretty pictures, but not much in the way of detailed construction information. There was no info on constructing circular stairs, instead, valuable space was spent explaining and photographing stone walkways on a hillside. It does not contain enough good instruction to be of help to me."
2,Binds with a Fenix TK15,"Got this holder for use with a Fenix TK15 for a Bianchi Duty belt. Use on the weak hand partial blind side - 9 o'clock location. I removed the belt clip and extra ring. It's not as smooth as a Maglite, but meets all the dimensional specifications of the Bianchi Holder -- Size 1. 1 inch diameter lights. It still get hung up on extraction. There is a stitch seam at the bottom interior of the holder that binds. This causes the solution to be inconsistent on extraction. I will not use it. Size 2 for 1.25 inch diameter lights will probably be too loose, but have not tried it."
1,twice broken,"The chandelier is a beautiful piece, the problem is the way they do the packing. I have order chanddeliers through other companies and never have any problem. In the first box all the swirl globes were broken and in the second box one globe was broken. So we have to do the packing again and take it to the closest UPS. It was a shame because I love the design."
5,"The""BackAtOne""VideoRemindsMeOf9-11","When I saw the video for this fantastic song 2 years ago,I thought it was outstanding.You have no idea whats going on in the film untill the end.This video really hit home after 9-11."
4,A Basic tools for beginner,"Suitable for beginning Tarot users, the Aquarian deck is a different presentation of the traditional card symbols and suits of Rods, Cups, Swords and Pentacles.What makes the Aquarian so powerful and enduring is the symbolism embodied in the artwork - a symbolism that evokes profound responses from the Unconscious mind.One of those touches is the way the faces of characters in the cards tend to be somewhat ethereal, showing less of the underlying personality than the Rider-Waite.For me, I like the system of the Aquarian, because of the responses they evoke from the Unconscious."
2,Not too great in evoking imagery,This was actually my first deck. I used it about 3 times before putting it in the closet. The cards itself seem to lack colour which is why I had trouble trying to interpret it. The style is very simplistic and medieval like. I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner as they might have trouble grasping at interpreting them. The Instant Tarot is a much better choice for beginners.
4,Gives both big picture and details of Symbian programming,"First when I saw the trailer (...)(...)I first thought it's more marketing material than training material.But when I watched it, I enjoyed this DVD as it starts with introduction and big picture of mobile programming and then goes into details and explains different part of Symbian and different UI platforms available for Symbian with code examples and how to compile and run in VC++.The prototype at the end and the yahoo group created for this DVD is a good idea to share knowledge if I get time and start doing the prototype."
5,"Well, yeah but....","Actually, there's a remastered version of this available with 24 songs, not the paltry 23 songs that must do for those sad folks who bought this one! It's called ""Calling All Blues"". The one drawback to the newer one is that it doesn't have artist listings for the musicians playing, like this does. But, heck, Junior Wells and Earl Hooker. Do you really need to know more? This is an exceptional example of 2nd gen Chicago harp blues. This was the cat who replaced Little Walter after Walter jumped ship in the middle of a tour backing Muddy Waters. There really isn't a better endorsement on earth than Muddy hiring you for your harp playing. Buy it, or your last words might be ""Calling all bluxxxxx"", not, ""Rosebud."""
4,Great Book,"I have read two of her books and they are great! I recently purchased the third novel in her series and haven't had to to read it yet but, looking forward to it..I hope that she will right seveal more...."
2,Could not finish it,"I am a huge fan of police thrillers.I bought this book based on the reviews I read here. Big mistake.This book was so boring that I only managed to read to page 120 and gave up.It felt as though the author just went on and on about nothing, the character (main) was flawed (which is ok) but I felt no sympathy for her and could not care less about the whole storyline.This was not a good buy."
5,One of my all-time favorite movies,"There are so many wonderful things to say about ""Topsy-Turvy"". I'll try to do a short, simple list here below:1. For Gilbert and Sullivan fans, it's hog heaven!2. The cast includes some of my favorite British talent - Jim Broadbent, Alan Corduner, Timothy Spall, and now, some new favorites. Every single actor was so thoroughly involved in the life of his character; all turned out tremendous acting and singing performances.3. The script was beautifully written; I was completely transported into the music, situations, historical events (such as the Japanese exhibition) and overall sense and sensibilities of the Victorian age.4. It's one of the few movies I'll consider owning in this day and age of Netflix. This movie is one that I'll watch again and again, lend out, make sure that friends and family get to see.Happy viewing!"
3,Good film despite meandering needlessly at the beginning,"I thought the film meandered needlessly at the beginning before getting a shot of adrenaline when Gilbert conceives his idea for The Mikado, which is hard to believe since Mike Leigh is usually quite economical with his films. But there are so many excellent scenes, especially during the 'rehearsals' portion of the film. And I like how the little obstacles that presented themselves in the staging of The Mikado did not pay off in an obvious fashion. When the light opera is performed with great aplomb and without a hitch, it is obvious that the actress with the bad leg and the actor with the morphine habit and the other actress with her bouts of depression are simply pros and that's that. No contrived complications. And I'm a sucker for this backstage type stuff to boot."
1,I know everyone will hate me-but this is boring,"Man, I really couldn't stand this movie. Three hour movies are fine, but they have to maintain some interest. If you like Gilbert and Sullivan, then I recommend going to see something they wrote. The musical portions of the movie were the only parts that were interesting-their lives were not exciting enough to make a movie about. I would much rather see a 1 hour documentary about them on TV than this. I know this review will not make me popular, but I just really did not like it."
2,Most overrated film of 1999,"Every critic in the world fell all over themselves in praise of Mike Leigh's ""Topsy-Turvy,"" calling it the most entertaining film of the year. I had to take this lumbering, 160-minute whale in little increments to prevent insanity from setting in.""Topsy-Turvy"" is one of the most spectacularly boring films I have ever seen, which is really a shame since it is very well-acted and features absolutely gorgeous sets and cinematography. But none of that means a thing if you can't bear to hear Gilbert & Sullivan show tunes for 160 minutes, not to mention the onslaught of dry, British humor that would be funny were it not so antiquated. Entertaining? Not in the slightest. ""Topsy-Turvy"" should be avoided at all costs by any American under the age of, say, 55. Sorry, folks, but Gilbert & Sullivan just doesn't do it for a 21-year-old."
1,Ha.,"Anyone who knows anything about G&S will die a slow groaning death at this ridiculously fabricated and inaccurate portrait of their collaborative process. It presents us with, among so many other things, a librettist that insists there is no class-consciousness in his writing, in so many words. Does Mike Leigh think we're idiots?"
1,Booooring,"I have performed in The Mikado twice and I can't figure out what is so great about this film. I kept torturing mystelf through it waiting for the good part and it never came. Even the performances in the film were uninteresting. I thought I was a fan of Gilbert & Sullivan, but I guess I'm not!"
2,Mike Leigh's worst film.,"I love Mike Leigh films, but this one was extremely long and very boring. I sat through about 75% of the film before giving up. It was desperately in need of editing. I give it two stars for the beautiful sets and costumes. If you love G&S, and I do not, you may find it enjoyable. However, if you love the realism of films like 'Naked' and 'Career Girls', you may want to steer clear of this one."
3,"Some will love it, others will find it a bit slow and tedious","I saw this movie shortly after it came out and I remember being somewhat bored with the slow pacing. I suspect the more familiar you are with the world of Gilbert and Sullivan the more you will enjoy the movie, but for others it might not be that accessible. The movie does contain some good performances and characterizations, and the relationship between G&S is nicely portrayed, but if you don't have an innate interest in the world of opera it all feels a bit predictable. Obviously some love this movie, but others will be a little letdown. Perhaps a rental first is in order."
4,Great background movie on Gilbert and Sullivan,This is a must-see for anyone interested in the lyric operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan. Make sure that you see it before you see any of the productions.
5,Fantastic Edition of a Very Good Film,"I ordered this for my parents and it was delivered well in time for our Christmas. However, the vendor sent me the wrong version. When I provided this information, the seller not only rushed the correct copy to my parent's home but did not require me to return the previous DVD. I will be buying all my DVDs from this company as they went well above the customer service level I expected.The best part of the Criterion version is the short, ""A Sense of History"", one of the best Jim Broadbent vehicles I have ever viewed. Well worth the entire cost of the DVD."
5,A REMARKABLE EVOCATION OF AN ERA...,"This is a wonderful film in many ways. Featuring G&S;, it's a lot of fun: good sound track. The acting is good by all; the direction, very fine.But what is most exciting about this film are the production values and the cinematography. The film is an incredible evocation of the later Victorian era. Visually, everything in this film is perfect: the set designer had a remarkable eye for detail--and every detail is there, down to the smallest item.Plus, the cinematography is exquisite. The director may share some of the credit for this, but still, it is remarkably well shot. The movement of the camera, and the angles achieved are splendid. The colors are rich and bright together.A marvelous work of cinema art."
3,Should have been much better,"I love G & S but was disappointed in this movie. It was very slow at first; only a confirmed lover of G & S would have stuck it out. Considered simply as a movie, it was excruciating. The costumes were great, as were the scenes from actual G & S productions. Another flaw was that only at the very end did the movie start to gel with more interesting material about each man's marriage/women, and the contrast between them. So, not bad, I enjoyed it b/c of my love of G & S, but it had lots of weaknesses."
5,Ten stars!,"I bought this movie without having ever seen it and all I can say is, what a delightful surprise! The Criterion Blu-ray edition is a work of art. I can't find any flaws in the transfer. The image is crisp, detailed, the color and skin tones, perfect. A dream come true in HD. In my opinion, this is one of those movies which benefits greatly from this Blu-ray fromat. Every scene is filled with rich textures, fabric, pattern and what not. A feast for the eyes! And ears! Those Gilbert and Sullivan tunes ARE catchy.The acting is excellent all around. One can tell the hand of a great director is at work in here. In a nutshell, I'm very happy with my purchase. I would heartily recommend this edition to anyone!"
2,What happened to the humor?,It's amazing how what looks like a documentary on the making of a very funny operetta (which I saw performed at Gordon College a week ago and laughed myself silly) could be so serious! Even the scenes of Mikado being performed have no sense of humor. Throughout you'd think they were staging King Lear!
2,A Christmas Turkey,"I was really looking forward to this as it was part of the BBC's prime time schedule for Christmas Day. But what a disappointment: although the acting, cinematography, period detail etc. was impressive the plot unfolded at a snail's pace. Did we really need an hour to establish the creative tension between the partnership? And where was the humour in what was supposed to be a time when people went out of their way to exhibit it in conversation? In the end I turned over to watch a documentary about another comedic duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore and had much more fun."
2,unbelievably long,"A real disappointment. This could have been an interesting story - but did we really need an hour and a half to show that G & S had become stagnant (before the Mikado)? Did we really need 15 minutes of scenes from The Sorcerer - this was not relevant to the story at all, other than the fact that the production had been ""revived"" since G & S hadn't produced new material. I didn't need to see scenes from the show to understand this. I agree that the costuming etc. was incredible, and there are some amusing moments, but the bottom line is that this film is just way too long and slow."
5,Topsy-Turvy (Criterion Blu-ray),"For those of us who had to be satisfied with the 2000 'Polygram USA Video' DVD of this hugely entertaining film, the new Criterion Blu-ray is orders of magnitude better, both in picture AND sound quality. Highly recommended! Give the standard DVD to your pet to watch."
5,Great Movie...Why's it Out of Print?,"As a Gilbert and Sullivan fan, I have always found this movie to be very interesting. The film might be a bit too slowly paced for some. I enjoyed the portrayls of daily life in the Victorian Era, but that aspect of the film may not be enjoyed by all. The one complaint I've heard about this film is that it is ""too slow.""In my opinion the movie really hits its stride when it talks about the making of Gilbert and Sullivan's famous operetta, ""The Mikado."" The scenes that describe the reactions of those in Victorian England to Japanese culture are the most amusing in the film.""Topsy Turvy"" also features actors who do their own singing, which for the most part is quite impressive. The scenes that feature actual moments from various operettas are amongst my favorites. I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1999, and its a shame its out of print and become harder to get a hold of."
4,Topy-Turvy (The Criterion Collection),"This is an entertaining show about the two masters of light operaand how they function in life. It is the initial concepts - and whyof the rest of the line - this is something of a mid life crisis.The music is good, costumes great and a nice show to watch."
3,Entertaining but sloooowwwwwwwww,"I was enchanted by ""Topsy Turvy"" during the parts that I wasn't asleep. It's really quite lively at times, and not just during the many fun performance segments. The few scenes that deal with the creative process are well done but whenever the energy level starts to pick up we get a leaden 15 minute bit about an actor who doesn't want to work without his corset on. This movie is a good choice as long as you don't wait until too late in the evening for viewing."
5,Great fun,"I have read some of the negative reviews here with amazement. Does this movie fairly and accurately portray Gilbert and Sullivan and Carte and their collaboration? I never expected it would. Movie biopics always embroider when they do not completely falsify biographical facts - e.g., The Great Caruso which bears little or no resemblance to the actual facts of the tenor's life but was hugely enjoyable anyway and inspired a generation of singers, including by his admission Jose Carreras. Actually, Topsy Turvy sticks closer to the facts - the general outline is true enough, even if some of the details are maybe skewed in the telling. But the performances, especially of the Mikado, are as good as they get. For historical accuracy and really serious analysis, read Carolyn Williams' superb Gilbert, Sullivan, and Gender, Genre, Parody (2010). For sheer enjoyment, see this rollicking movie."
3,"Not a perfect sim, but it is fun","This game is a fun sim for the casual racing sim driver. GP3 goes from too easy to near impossible very quickly. This game is in that middle ground.It is challenging but not intimidating. It's graphically stunning without being demanding on hardware. I've had stability issues with WinMe, and hardware issues with WinXP, but once running, this game is fun."
5,"Best show/music since Dave Matthews' ""Under the Table...""","If you get a chance to see this band live in a small venue before they hit the big time (and they will soon), GO SEE THEM! Their music, lyrics, stage presence, and audience appreciation are impressive. We recently saw them at The Last Day Saloon in San Francisco, and I haven't enjoyed a live show so much since seeing the Dave Matthews Band at the Cat's Paw in Bozeman, Montana, just before they hit it really big. This self-titled album is fantastic from the first listen -- every song -- and you'll find yourself playing it over and over and over... A modern classic. Need I say more?"
4,Music Lover,"In layman's terms. ""What a wonderful CD!"". I bought this about two weeks ago and have not been able to stop listening. Tom Luce has a great voice. The harmonies are gorgeous and lyrics provocative at times. Have never been one to let the production and mixing make my decision on whether or not I liked the artist. But would definately have to say that all of the above and the combination of mixing makes this a wonderful find. The very significant details have not been compromised in order to just get the music out there. The violin/cello/harmonica incorporated with the usual atmosphere have the makings for a wonderful debut. Pick it up. You won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent,"I love this CD - listen to it constantly. I first heard about the band after hearing the song ""Good Day"" on Alias, but I love all the tracks, especially Long Way Down, Electric Chair, and Life. An amazing group of songs, you won't get tired of it."
5,Everyone Should hear this Cd,"I am a Musician from Long Island, New York. Its a shame that a great CD like the one that Luce has here will never be on the radio for the masses to hear. I have a huge Cd collection of my own, and this Cd is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of buying. In a day here when most bands sound so much alike, Its great to hear a man like Tom Luce put out this Cd even if the masses miss out. I tell everyone I know to get it and have even bought most of my friends the Cd. They all love it.If you love ear friendly Pop with a nice Funk/jazz groove with great smart lyrics, you will love this Cd. If you get this and love it, feel free to write me @ Toadny@optonline.net. I have many other Cd's from bands that will never be on the radio that you may love."
5,oh hell yes,"Wow, that is all I can say. This is a complete album. Each song is different and great. I saw them play live a couple of weeks ago and they are a must see. Buy this album."
4,This is a very good listen,"Great writing counts for something. It always comes down to the songs, the structure, the lyrics, the playing and how its all tied together. This is a very good CD. Pleasant surprise and worth the money. Excellent playing, excellent writing and has a very moody feel to it that I like."
4,Surprisingly Good,"The best way I can describe the game is ""one of those basic knock-offs"". You get that sense when you see the packaging. It is an older game with dated graphics but the gameplay is pretty good, and it delivers on what it is trying to duplicate. Experienced gamers will find little new in this one, but if you are looking for something to spend some time on, this is a good choice. It was suprisingly good. Check around, was a time you could find it in the bargain bin.Hail Flavius!"
1,Limp Album,This is one the worsts albums I've ever owned other then A funky Headhunter. Eat you alive is a great track and the only one thats worth listening too.
3,whats going on!,"This album was by far the worst limp album yet.I love this band which is why i still gave them 3 starts.But it looks like when wes left he took everything limp was with him. I hope they dont become like korn and stink up the place after 3rd album. There next album better be good. If it goes back to the style as 3dolla bill yall it will kick ass. But i do have hope for the future, they still must get more use to there new guitarist. I STIlL HAVE HOPE IN THEM!!!!!!"
1,Fred needs to go away,"Don't be fooled, there is nothing new here. It's the same old crap from one of the most untalented people in music. The rest of the band needs to wake up like Wes and move on, they're at least competent. This CD warrents no stars, but that's not fair to the rest of the band. It's time for Durst to sink and fade away so we never have to hear anymore of the crap he puts out and labels music. He's just as vacant as Britney and the Backstreet Boys: its all TRL fluff. There was a reason bizkit got booed off stage at many Summer Sanitarium tour dates. You want real heavy music, pick up the latest from KMFDM or Ministry."
1,bad and awful,Limp Bizkit is gotta be the most overrated and worst band in the world. They don't know where they are headed for. There is nothing original about this album. I mean these guys were pathetic on tour with Metallica. Infact they were pelted from the stage in Chicago. Don't buy this CD and save ur money for some good stuff coming in next few months. The lyrics are awful and music sucks... Stay away... No talent.
3,good but not their best,"...IT'S PRETTY GOOD, NO WARE BETTER THEN STARFISH OR SIG. OTHER, BUT IT'S GOOD. IN MY OPINION IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE HOLDING BACK ON BEING HARD ON THIS ALBUMN, THEY HAVE A GREAT NEW GUATARIST THAT IS WAY BETTER LIVE THEN WES BORLAND WAS, BUT MOST OF THE SONGS ARE JUST KINDA DEPRESSING. TRACKS 2,3,6,8,12,AND 15 ARE WELL WORTH THE PRICE OF BUYING THIS ALBUMN, SO ALL YOU NON-HATERS, GO BUY THIS, YOU WON'T BE MAD UNLESS YOU SMOKE THE SAUSAGE.KEEP IT REAL"
1,limp bizkit burned out,"As a fan of the previous Limp Bizkit albums I'd advise anyone that might purchase this album that it is garbage. One song with a Snoop Dogg cameo does not an album make. This album truly rates less than one star, save your money. I feel thoroughly ripped."
1,hahahaha! These people keep on writing good reviews...,"The funny thing here is that people keep on writing good reviews making themselves believe that Limp Bizkit is actually a good band. Cmon' we all know that u really hate them and are just writing to grab our attention...or you really are losers listening to crap like this. I don't want to dis u or insult you, but there are better bands out there. Check out Iron Maiden, Slayer, Ozzy or Megadeth. Limp Bizkit is just a f**ked up piece of sh*t. Fred Durst is a bad singer and an even worse rapper trying to fit in with the black dudes. Stupid.LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, LIMP...you entitled this RESULTS MAY VARY but it looks like the results didn't vary. They all were the same. THEY ALL SIAD THAT U SUCKED, U F**KED UP PIECE OF HORSE SH*T!"
1,Please......,"I believe that we should have the option of giving an album absolutely no stars, or maybe even negative as the case would be for this piece of crap. ANY BAND WHOSE FIRST SINGLE IS A COVER OF A CLASSIC ROCK SONG SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT THE REST OF THE ALBUM HAS TO OFFER: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. What's worse is they don't even do The Who justice. He repeats the beginning verse over and over and right when the song is supposed to start to rock he makes out with Hally Berry and it abruptly ends. American rock is suffering because of ""bands"" like Limp Bizkit, but far from dead. Ladies and Gentlemen, there are plenty of great rock bands in this country if you just look past the billboard top 40. (Bands that write about real-world situations, not crying over some souless pop star who didn't f**k you after a night at Skybar) Do yourself a favor and do a little searching before you accept what's spoonfed to you."
1,Maybe Next Time,"Not what I was expecting. Hopefully the next album will be like the past ones. LB should not be known as a ""soft"" band but this CD will pigeon hole them under that heading. Save your money for the next album or go out and buy the past albums (excluding New Old Songs)."
3,alright,First off...most of the tracks seem to be lacking bass. In some of the songs you get your occasional boom or thump but they are so far out of the normal bass spectrum you can expect your subs to distort and possibly blow up. The last 2 albums from limp b where some of the best sounding cd's i had that hit perfect and sounded great. Most of the songs are just lacking. Due to the fact most of the songs sound like someone is beating on a tin can with a pencil i should give this album a 1 or a 2 but i will give it a 3 since it does have some good tunes. Could have been better.
5,Anyone who doesn't give this CD 5 STARS must be deaf!,The best music I have heard all year from ANY artist!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Music for 13 year-olds,"Limp Bizkit is and always has been a band for 13 year olds. People shouldn't expect anything more from them, or less. And no, i havent ever bought a limp bizkit album, im not a hater who buys their albums.(i couldnt believe the rant i read by a previous reviewer, what a knob). Reading the positive reviews for this album it becomes clear who supports this band. On a positive note Limp Bizkit has aquired former Snot guitarist for this album who makes the music listenable in places, but as the critics have been saying fred durst is quite possibly the worst frontman in history."
3,Slower...,"This new CD is great, but it is slower than the others. We can see the maturity in the songs. I think it is a great CD to take it cool an reflect. And the DVD is pretty cool, I'll buy the Poop DVD this winter it's sure!"
4,Ainge - awsome cd,"I Think that Fred was going to go down hill since the remix of his old cd but i got this cd and i think he did exalant. He has songs for bashing youre head against the wall and songs to just sit back and vibe with. His song ""Down Another Day"" is the best song yet. I would get this cd as soon as posible."
1,What Happened to LImp Bizkit??,"What happened to Bizkit whats wrong with them trying something new i heard 3 good songs and one ok one ""Eat you alive"" ""Red Light Green Light"" ""Gimme the Mic"" and ""Behind Blue Eyes"" besides that the cd is trash and what happened to puttin Just Drop dead and Crack addict on it Bizkit is goin down hill from here on out. Fred took them into the wrong stuff. They need to back to there hard stuff and not this mellow stuff."
2,waste,"All that time waiting for a load of rubbish.I just couldnt wait for this album to come out,but it was a waste of time,i had to get out Significant Otherjust to here them @ their best.I cant believe why they never put the song Crack Addict on it,or Just Drop Dead which is on the Eat u Alive cd.The only song which is worth a mention is Red Light-Green Lightwith Snoop Doggy Dogg."
2,ZZZZZZZZ Kit,"WHat a terd. This one will put you to sleep. If you like old Limp Bizkit, you won't like this ""new"" Limp Bizzzzzzz Kit."
4,Bzkit new sound is great,the new cd is great i like the new sound fred has took . I always though some of the songs on the cd with compulsive yelling got old but the new more alternative songs are jsut great like the song down another day shows that limp bizkit can make it as a alternative rock group along with the rap essance
1,Warning: This CD could actually make you dumber!,"Classical music is supposed to stimulate your brain, well; Limp Bizkit actually lowers your I.Q. by de-stimulating your brain. If you listen to them long enough you could become permentantly dumb. You could find yourself blindly following masses of people without rationally thinking about it. You could end up replacing letters in words with the letter ""z"" for no apparent reason. You could be wearing outdated clothes that never looked good anyway. You could end up living in a trailer park (not that it's a bad thing). If you've gotten this far down (congrats you can read) and don't like your options; there is still a chance for you. Realize your mistake and think for yourself."
1,Couldn't finish the whole cd,"Like the title says plus add that I burned it. Durst is, and this comes from knowing him personally AND hating him personally, a selfish twit who makes music like a selfish twit does. This album is beyond the word horrible; it's Durst's usually animosity for womankind when really all he focuses on is womankind to begin with. He's like the little obsessed puppy who, when he gets turned away, goes cries in the corner...except when Durst gets turned away, he writes songs about how much he hates the world. Its really sad...the man needs some help. There's so much in life other than to play the victim everytime. He needs a cold shower and a psychiatrist..."
1,how many times do i need to FLUSH before they go away?,"Yea... how many times do I need to flush their albums DOWN THE TOILET before they quit!?!?!? These guys are the most talentless in the world. So many bands these days took influence from previous bands like this, and that is exactly why the state of modern music is as bad as it is. Wes Borland was the only member with any talent. He was thinking, and thinking intelligently at that, when he ditched Bizkit. I sense even more deterioration (if possible), in the future for these posers. I've had to flush 5 Bizkit CD's down the toilet... I hope this band doesn't live to release another album. They've destroyed music's future enough."
4,limp bizkit will be around a while,"This CD had loads of negative and positive hype. At summer Sanitarium they were booed off stage everywhere they went, well this cd answers the critics of them being a pop culture band, its absolulty more rock orentated. But Fred's lyric's at times, sound like he had writers block. but overall because of a harder and different sound I gave it 4 stars. Even if this cd does not sell well limp bizkit will be around for a long time to come."
2,My brain went Limp and I fell asleep to this CD,"This album did not rock my socks. Fred Durst is a wuss. The majority of the songs on this album are slow rock songs like the hit ""My Way"". And like that song said, Fred has chosen to do this album his way and it sucks. That's why Wes left because the band was going nowhere fast. They used to get me pumped up....now I put this cd in as I go to sleep.If you're new to Limp Bizkit and like to listen to the radio all day, you will like this album because it sounds like every other band out there.I'd like to slap Fred Durst across the forehead with my ""limp bizkit""."
5,Limpbizkit Makes Comeback,"The new album is awesome. I honestly thought that I would be disapointed. Im glad to say I was not dissapointed, even though it is not their best album ever produced, its remarkable. Fred Durst actaully sings in some of the songs, and adds a beautiful context to the album. Old way were also expressed on the album..Snoop Dogg is featured on their song ""Red Light Green Light."" I personally enjoy the hidden tracks. My favorite song on Results May Vary is probley ""Lonely World."" Go out and buy the album. Most retailers sell the version with the DVD ""Poop"" on it. Which also is great. Limpbizkit proved the haters wrong, and they have yet again comeback in style."
1,L.B. concert = throw stuff at the band,"Holy s*** how can people still go out and buy this band's albums? 3 Dollar wasn't band, Significant Other was barely tolerable, but what else do they have to offer? The only talent was Wes and when he left (lucky for him), any creativiety with this band evaporated. Put them out of their misery once and for all."
3,Music and cover,I would like to say that the cover of this album and the music are not ver much alike at ALL
2,Is this a joke?,"Significant other was an all time classic. Limp Bizkit really had something at the time, but with CS&THFW there was a complete dropoff. Now this useless disc has been released. Eat you alive is badass, but there is nothing else to grasp onto. I was 17 when their debut came out, and i could identify with their first two albums-where is this album's nookie, break stuff, counterfiet, or boiler. The lyrics are childish and without heart. Head for the barricade is unbearable to the point of retarded, and red light green light is plain terrible. LB has let a true fan down. Why has Fred Durst turned into a whiny little girl. This albums sucks. I change my review to one star. Please let the poop dvd and the album that is supposed to be released in the spring totally blow me away."
5,pdxBoy,"All these haters hating the master behind the mic, well Limp Bizkit is back and the cd I have to say is awesome. About half of the cd is hard-core and half is mellow bringing something for all of his fans! Red light-Green light is just an awesome track featuring Snoop Dog, very unique and fresh... Much respect to man bringing the beats!!"
1,These guys are still around?,"At least Wes Borland (probably the only one from Limp Bizkit that had any talent to begin with) had some sense when he ditched Limp Bizkit. ""Results May Vary"" finds this pretender band doing less of the rap rock thing that helped propel them to platinum plus status and more of a sensitive, so called ""hard rock"" that seems to be the current way for bands to find success today. Witness ""Behind Blue Eyes"" which features an acoustic guitar backing Fred ""Yes, I'm still alive and more annoying than ever"" Durst attempting to put some actual emotion into this stuff that they, and their few remaining fans, call music. Whichever way you cut it though, ""Results May Vary"" is yet another album to toss on the scrap heap. You want hard rock with real emotion, soul, and heart? Go listen to Faith No More, Biohazard, Corrosion of Conformity, Down, Audioslave, or Black Label Society, and save yourself some brain cells."
1,Sucks more than a fried chicken drumstick.,"This album is so bad, it is idioticSongs are stupid, dull instrument playing, fred douchbagis just like feminem, solos are zero and this Remakeof a classic by the who is a wastefred durst you are finishedDJ Lethal do yourself a favor and depart thisband and go back to whitey ford aka everlastI'm glad this album flopped BIG Time.One Star."
3,|3.5| Easily one of the best Bizkit albums.,"Yeah yeah everyone hates Limp Bizkit. Well guess what; I don't and I listen mainly to oldies (Zep, Doors, Stones). Anyway, with that aside, 'Results May Vary' is easily one of the best Bizkit albums thus far.First of all, LB takes some risks and goes for various slower and more mellow tracks. It is a good try, but it just does not work at all. Stick to your strengths guys.Once all the scrap is gone, you get to the good stuff; the songs that just make you wanna jump. Tracks like ""Gimme the Mic"" and ""Eat you Alive"" are highlights, but the best one would have to be ""Creamer (radio is dead).""If you liked Chocklate Starfish, you'll like this album. The slow and mellow stuff here will most likely hit you out of no where and you'll probably not like it. But everything else (the good stuff) makes this an above average disc. Thumbs up."
1,"They made me put 1 star,............","I saw WimpNuzkit with METALLICA AND MUDVAYNE (in chicago) and they pretty much confirmed my longheld suspicion that they are not worthy to rock with MUDVAYNE, LINKIN PARK, AND MASTERS OF ALL REALITY.....METALLICA! They dissed everyone and got themselves booed off. Why is the question I ask whenever DurstTheWurst starts to think he can jam? I really don't quite know why Mudvayne would ever open for Limp Durst. I believe a new singer for Limp Bizkit is mandatory, imperative, dire, and preeetttty much way overdue. Thank you very much for reading."
4,not bad but not great,its not as good as chocolate starfish and there are a lot more slow songs in this cd. give it a chance though just download gimme the mic or re-entry or some other song off the cd. you have to listen to some of the songs a few times before you really appreciate the cd.
3,Does Hard means anything to you,"Well, the overall album is not bad for anyother band but for limp bizkit it's hmmm too soft where are the real explicit lyrics and the Metal sound of it. Maybe I'm being too demanding but groups can'T realese albums just for the fun of it.Well not bad but could have been better real better"
5,"Classic LB , but thicker!!!","GREAT ALBUM, TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO ABSORB ALL THE SOUNDS AND MEANINGS OF THIS MUSIC...STILL HAS THE HEAD SHAKIN ELEMENT, BUT MUCH MORE DEEP AND NICE MIXTURE OF STYLES....AWESOME..ANOTHER PLATINUM...PEACE...AWESOME ALBUM RELEASE SHOWS ON MTV TOO!!"
2,Trying but its fake ...,"I seen the new video to this bands new single and now they want to do the rock sound . before it was the rap rock sound and now its rock .. dont be fooled by this band , they are in this more for the money than anyother band i have ever seen ... its like puff daddy of the rock world .. like i said before , fred durst is just a buisness man .... also , crazytown is like these guys clones , crazytowns two cd's did the same thing as this one .. first rap/rock then rock ... who are they trying to fool .."
1,You people still listen to this?,"Okay common, limp bizkit never wrote any good song, its all crap! You guys say you like metal? then listen to it! Limp Bizkit is no metal.. its crap... You guys just go by stuff you see on MTV.. have you not heard of good bands such as Dream Theater, or Iron Maiden? or some foreign bands like In Flames, or Opeth? whatever.. buy this album if you like, good idea, give them more money so they can make another crappy CD. Id like to give their next CD a one star right now..."
1,If Only There Was a Rating Lower...,"Thanks to this useless piece of plastic, never again will I be able to eat a soft, crusty biscuit all smothered in cream gravy without LB's horrendous, yet incredibly pathetic, overly-marketed, corporate trash excuses for music bouncing off the walls of my brain like a straight-jacketed lunatic flinging himself wildly around his padded, maximum-security, mental institution cell. And for this travesty - this defilement of all that is good in the world, and most of all - in the name of biscuits, especially ones that don't consider themselves ""limp"" - I rate this album negative (-) 2000 stars."
5,"""Results May Vary"" is Limpbizkit's best overall Cd indeed!!!","This album is their best! The album has so much depth because the lyris are so real and inspirational! The lyrics, along with the music touch me more and relate more to me more than any other album! ""Results May Vary"" is so different from their other albums and shows another side of Limpbizkit! This album is the turning point in their carrers! It turns them from a good/alright band to a great one! This cd is so real with a passion! Its great!Laters, Paul"
1,HELP!!! MY BIZKIT IS LIMP!!!!,"I cant believe people buy into this bands weak music!! It's weak, bland and rehashed! But then again, the people buying Limp Bizkit probably bought Brittney Spear's CD. Fred Durst has no talent and is WAAAAAAYYYYYY too busy being a so called ""celebrity"". Do yourselves a favor, if you want to hear seriously good hard music listen to or Nothingface or Stillsuit or Taproot or the hundreds of other bands that have way more talent then this ""LIMP"" band!!"
1,"Fred Durst, SUCKS!","I've never liked Limp Bizkit, and dont ever plan to. Fred's lyrics are very ameture..example..""I did it all for the Nookie, so you can get that cookie, and stick it up your ass."" He has no writing ability, and is just a white guy trying to be something he isn't. He is quite annoying, and this album doesn't prove him any greater. He needs to just give up, and if you haven't watched MTV's special on ""Album Launch."" HE IS A STLAKER! Having His studio decorated with Angelina Jolie pictures, and writing songs on how he feels for her, when they haven't ever spoken, and even seen each other. This guy has major issues, and i think needs to find some other profession. This album debut at #3, selling 150,000 copies. Yes, that really shows a great comeback..not!..Hopefully this will get Fred to just shut up for a minute,annoying voice, bad songs, and nothing better to sing about than people he doesn't know, and relationships he wishes he had..enough said!"
5,The Limp is still Bizkit,"I admit I was anxious when the new Limp cd kept getting pushed back, after listening, my concerns were erased. This is an awesome cd. I mean no disrespect to Wes, but the Limp is more than Wes Borland. All true LImp Bizkit fans should buy this cd. It is totally worth it."
1,Horrible Album-Bring Back Boreland!,"There really is nothing that can be said of this album except that I hope Bizkit brings back Wes Boreland. The album is actually painfull to listen to. For starters, I have seen all the documentaries on Bizkit making this album and I think they are in deep trouble. Why is Fred Durst literally telling everyone what to play and how to play it? Where is the creativity and musicianship of anyone? Boreland was creative, or at least wanted to be. This time around it appears that whatever Durst wants, Durst gets. Not a happy mixture for a band. I say, bye bye Limp Bizkit. It was a good ride in the beginning. Now its just ""that same old gag"" which is not creative. Time to move on to other bands who are producing quality, CREATIVE music where everyone has an input on the final product. This album is just horrendous."
1,Dissappointing yet again.....,"Cmmon LB, whats up with this album? Thought you says said this was your best record? Its AWFUL! I LOVED 3 dolla bill and significant other but HATED chocoloate starfish but I gave this album a chance cuz Eat you alive is pretty good. Out of all the tracks on here, ""gimme the mic"" and ""drop dead"" are the only other decent ones. I think its time for LB to just give it up. If you want to listen to a GREAT ALBUM, I suggest the new one from Korn- Take a look in the mirror. Now that is a GREAT record. Will please the old school fans and the new fans."
2,limp bizkit sink,"picked up this cd the day it came out since i am or in this particular case used to be a huge bizkit fan.the album was awful.wes bolands departure from the band seems to have a massive impact on their music.they sound way too alternative on this one and most definitely do not qualify as the top rap/metal band they used to be.fred durst sounds like a complete moron when he attempts to sing.overall the album sounds like a alternative/acoustic cd with a touch of very bad hardcore guitaring.the band should have done whateer it took to keep wes boland with them afterall it clearly seems like he was the reason they were ever so huge all these years until now.peace,wes ! ur the man and as for the rest of the lb crew most definitely including the new guitarist............get new jobs !!!!!!!!!!"
1,My first review eeeeeever,"I have never written a review before....but after hearing this steaming pile of crap I purchased I felt the need to stop others from buying it as well.....I really expected LB to come out with their most killer CD to date to prove to the masses they are a band to be reckon with with or without their former guitar player/song writer.....instead we got this......Results May Vary?? I don't think so Fred......Results Do Suck!! I want my money back....and just a suggestion....I know rap-rock is ""out"" now....but you can't sing dude.....and pleeeeeease don't use these slams to your new CD as material for your next CD....none of us feel bad for you now that you wrote a complete CD about how ""nobody likes me....everybody hates me....I'm gonna go eat worms"".......Congrats Fred......you went from Nookie and Break Stuff to filling up used CD bins across the nation!!!"
4,This is a fresh taste,"Since 3 Dollar Billz Ya'll came out, Limp Bizkit has been going a little Pop-ish, but they've seem to overcome Pop and put out a decent album. I really enjoyed listening to it for the first time, the whole album only has one song which could be a single (Which is already the single) is a good thing because you won't see TV overplay any of the songs. Some of the bold songs on the album would be ""Behind Blue Eyes"" ""Drown"" ""Build A Bridge"" and ""Underneath The Gun"", album also includes a Hip Hop song featuring Snoop Dogg. Album is worth buying, if you're unsure, get to a store that lets you listen to an album before purchasing it."
4,Results May Vary...my result = PLEASED,"WOW! This is one of the BEST cd's I've purchased in a long time. This is especially one of the best limpbizkit cd's I have bought. Yes, anger, rage, cursing, part of Fred Durst, but in this cd, it seems that he really dug deep into his real emotions. It seems to me that he went through some type of ""spiritual"" revelation, the songs have true emotion, they have descriptions that people can relate to. There are many songs that are slow, you are able to hear what he's feeling, without the cussing and screaming. The new edition of The Who's song ""Behind Blue Eyes"" basically sums up everything that Fred goes through, or has gone through. I really like this song, he sings it with such heart, that you actually get a bit emotional while listening to it. Once again, this is one of the best cd's I've bought, and I hope that other's will buy this, appreciating it as much as I did."
1,What is a Limp Bizkuit,"Guess what i haven't listen to the new album because I beleive I shouldn't waste my time. Limp needs to start up a new band called lets move on with our lives because we are washed up old bastards. If limp can bring out a disc, so can Gary Pornstar!"
1,Fred Durst is an idiot!!!!!!!!!!,Limp Bizkit is one of the worst bands in history and Fred Durst has absolutely no talent.Why don't you people get off of this radio friendly mtv crap and go get some real music.And one more thing Fred Durst wishes he had the talent of Trent Reznor.
1,ITS OVER!,"This isnt music, this was a struggle for a final few dollars, the cd seems slapped together, the past two cds have been off from what i thought limp bizkit should be, styles and sounds change, and thats usally what makes way for new bands, and ends careers, its back to the basments and and bars for you guys, thanks for making a horrible cd that will make the new groups sound even better. Borland must have seen the light."
1,Washed up,"Limp Bizkit used to be awesome. Everyone loved them, but Durst messed everything up. Without Wes, I knew the band would plummit, but I didn't think this badly. All the Songs sound like mainstream stuff. It's as if Fred Durst really wants people to like him, so he's copying what the majority of people DO like, except really badley.Don't buy this CD"
2,Horrible,"Limp Bizkit used to rock and have phat ass beats. Now their beats are stale and there is no emotion in the music. Fred your fears have confronted you and this album is bland, dry, and downright horrid. It has 2 songs that rock I give it that. But any band that uses ""Speak N Spell"" in their music, is starved for ideas. I mean come on. I got about thirty-six cents of enjoyment out of this cd. If you are not a live for Limp Bizkit fan, save your money, this cd is a major flop."
1,TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I used to like limp bizkit because of their hard rock songs. I thought this one would have the same type of music. I listened to ""Eat you alive"" which actually one of the three songs (out of 16 songs) that I like in this album.Limp bizkit becomes a softy somehow. Overall, this album sounds like a boyband tries to sing a hard music."
4,"Not bad, not mind blowing though","I've been an old school Limp fan since the first release of 3dollar bill ya'll. Significant other was awesome, and chocolate starfish was solid as well. This one is a bit different, it has some good and some bad tracks. The cover of behind blue eyes is probably the best track on the cd, and alot of the songs follow that slow type beat. They still rip it up break stuff style on a couple songs, but most is more mellow than what i'm used to. I'm not gonna be a hater and diss this cd, but i think they could have done a little better. All the hype and delay of this cd hurt it. All in all, it's good, but not great."
1,Behind Blue Eyes ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"Cheap-Trick - When you get nothing else to put in your worthless album, add a cover version of a popular song.. everyone else now does it, why would LimpBizkit stay away -""Behind Blue Eyes"" is the result..The worst-rock-band-of-all-time's worst album. Copycats !! I can't stand that voice (same goes to Linkin Park)..if Backstreet boys could afford buying a couple of guitars and gazettes, then even they could have been more rocking than Bizkit."
1,BAH~,oh please.. dun waste ur money on this nonsense..i am totally upset with this album. Now i think limp bizkit is total bullsh*t.. the star is for Wes.. you could fush the rest down to the sewage plant.. you've been warned!
5,Results - in search of,"I know people were expecting this album to be hardcore. Don't get me wrong there are songs on the cd that are, like""Gimme the Mic."" But I think this record is more about soul searching and I'm glad they did it this way. It's time for people to realize what bands go through to bring you what your listen needs. There are extreme trade offs and sacrifices made by the artists we all love and fame and fortune never come without a price. So I just want to say thank you for sharing your talents with me and I love you all."
1,UGH THIS IS BAD,"what the -- is this. some corperet rap rock that went way way bad this album is just a cover up from the last imbarrising album. do not buy this cd I REAPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MOENY ON ""FRED DURST"" without Wes you have no good guitar riffs. i find myself laughing at freds lyrics there so so lame. eat you alive has gotta be the worst song on the cd. once again lame lyrics in that song. fred give up and wuit sellin out!!!!!!!!!!"
1,this cd sucks,"Fred Durst has once again encouraged me to not listen to him anymore. I actually like his voice, he just doesnt know what to do with it sometimes and it is very present on this record. Don't buy it, if you want good hard rock, check out Fuel's new album - Natural Selection."
1,This sux,I was hoping that there was a 0. This CD is horrible. I got it as a gift and i gave it back. I hope Fred wakes up and gets back to his old self quick. Pls dont waste your money.
1,This is pathetic,"Sell out? Not with this album, Limp Bizkit sold out a long time ago. There first album was so fierce, so full of great lyrics and music and energy. Now LB sounds washed up and tired. I would rather have had them doing the same thing over and over again.. many bands can stick with their sound and still be good. Look at Rage Against the Machine.This album is extremely pathetic.. please don't waste your money. If people listen and really like it well cool for them, if your a fan of how limp bizkit used to sound this is not for you at all..."
4,Britney Obsession???,How many of these songs do you think are attributed to his obsession to Britney....... i can think of at least 5........
1,"""LIMP""...BIZKIT is right","Listening to this CD left me limp! This is garbage. Fred Durst cant sing to save his life and the songs are weak to say the least. The only one with talent is the drummer, he should stop wasting his time with this no good band."
2,Remake,"I haven't heard it and don't plan to the new single is allright, just when i was going to listen to more they had to remake a classic and to top it off he wrote his own lyric to it, Durst Stick to F**king up your music not others!!!!!!!!!!"
2,ehh..........,"I was a fan of Significant other and really liked rollin but was disappointed with Chocolate Starfish. I then liked Eat you alive so went ahead and got results may vary but honestly, it sux. Their cover of the whos behind blue eyes SUX. I heard thats the second single....Boy are they in for it...Drown is probably the only other good song. I don't recommend it at all, if you are a die-hard bizkit fan then get it. I do recommend Korn's: Take a look in the mirror on November 18. Their new song ""Right Now"" beats any song on Results May Vary."
2,What happened?,"This cd is by far the worst cd ever put out by Limp bizkit. There are maybe three good songs on this cd (2 of which are eat you alive and gimme the mic). The rest of the cd is pretty disappointing. The songs are all slower, none of that fast, head banging songs like their past cds....WHAT HAPPENED?I wouldn't recommend buying this cd...sorry?!"
4,Different,"Well to start this cd is mellow. I don't mind that. If ya think about it all the best bands out there produce mellow songs. Metallica has done it, Disturbed, Godsmack. Even going back further I'm sure there is too. Limp Bizkit as a group Tried something different, not the same hate the world crap. I liked the heaviness of previous albums, but I like the fact that its different. Slipknot to me only has one album. The second sounds the same as the first. And Fred new that this album wouldn't get the same reviews hence the name, Results May Vary. In my eyes if your not all about the headbangin music, the buy this album, but if your lookin for something heavier, I would look elsewhere."
3,not bad,this is comming from a non limp bizkit fan...it is not bad at all ...give it a try and pretend you never heard of them and you will find that it is a good listen and will enjoy it
1,Buying limp bizkit cds is like wasting money...,"Rap-metal isn't around anymore thank god and wimp bizkit still trying to bring that garbage back? No!Anyways, ""results may vary "" is just plain horrible and dumb lirycs and over-all? A poser sound... Rap metal does suck and im glad it doesn't exist anymore. F*cking posers."
1,THIS IS JUS AWFUL,omg this cd is just plain awful fed durst acts like h wants u to hate him-eww stay away from this terrible cd-haha the cd is as bad as its cover i guess u cn judge a book by its cover--nice work fred NOT!
1,lame,"Dont even bother with this. Go buy ""Three Dollar Bills Yall"" if you want to hear them play real music"
1,Avoid this like every other Limp Bizkit CD,"This album is pure trash, just like everything that they have released. Hardcore? You want hardcore, listen to Hatebreed. This cd sucks. Limp bizkit is just another crappy nu-metal band on the top 40 charts. If you want some real metal listen to Usurper or Morbid Angel. STOP LISTENING TO THIS KORN-METAL GARBAGE YOU BRAINWASHED FOOLS!"
1,bad bad bad limp bizkit,"first of all, what the hell is this? i mean, it's not rock, and all the songs sound the same. it's sappy! not the old stuff, not at all, this cd is too sappy and the melody sounds like it was repeated over and over."
1,Limp Wristed,"Fred CANNOT Sing. The songs are weak and uninspired.A total let down to any limp fan, not to mentionto any music fan in general.Limp Bizkit is dead."
1,worthlessly terrible,"Matthew626 couldn't have said it better. I thought the whole album was drippy, uninspiring, and downright depressing. Every song has this second rate feel, like a bad caricature of their old stuff. Fred Durst is exactly one and the same, and this new guitarist is really bland..he sounded like a backup guitarist on an old Metallica album. I was overwhelmingly surprised that out of 16 songs that there was not one that really grabbed me. I am truly shocked and disgusted that this is what they put out after 3 years of absence. I really could have made something close to it in my backyard in 3 or 4 months. Pretty shameful for a band at their stage of the game. I really was expecting something more in some way. They're done.."
1,Are you people ok?,"Sorry, but Fred what were you thinking? This album is by far not LB's best work.... Yeah there are a few catchy songs for the TLC lovers, but this is not the LB I listened to before."
3,Not Worth the Hype :(,"I purchased this CD after hearing all of the hype about it on the radio and TV. Limp Bizkit was an extraordinary band in their earlier days...but what happened. It seems like something is missing. However, I do have some favorites on the album: ""Eat You Alive,"" ""Red Light-Green Light,"" ""Phenomenon,"" and their cover of ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" by The Who. Unfortunately, those are the only ones I even listen to. I want the old Limp Bizkit back :( I say if you are a huge fan of Limp Bizkit, maybe this album might be an investment to you. Otherwise, save your money."
2,Limp Bizkit is back,"At first I listened to the album and hated it because it sounded so different, but after listening to it a couple times it started to really grow on me. This album is a lot more mellow than the previous albums. My favorite songs on the album are ""underneath the gun"", ""down another day"", and ""build a bridge"". Some of the songs really suck like ""red light-green light"" and ""the only one"". These songs sound like filler songs that were written just to take up time on the cd. Just listen to their lyrics, they are really lame."
1,Where next for fred durst??,"This really is terrible,terrible stuff,Ive listen to this album twice and i'd rather stick burning matches in my eyes than listen to it again,its muck.can you give an album minus stars?because this album desearves it.I know it might seem im coming down hard on limp bizkit but its just such a dissappointment for me to hear how bad this is,I knew after Wes left that the band as a whole might suffer but I didnt think this much.DONT BUY THIS ALBUM,even if you are a fan,give the money you were going to buy this album with to the homeless guy around the corner because you'll get a whole lot more satisfaction from it...."
4,still goin strong,"i thought this was a great comeback album for limp. now i dont think its their best. in my opinion, chocolate starfish was their best and they will never be the same w/o wes. nonetheless, this is a awesome cd with great tracks. i cant get enough of ""eat you alive"". i also love the intro song and #3, (""gimme the mic"") is a bad-ass typical limp song. go buy this cd. you wont be dissapointed."
3,On the Right Track,"I agree with other reviewers that this Limp album is going back to their ROOTS. Remember, they were a rock band first. Sure they had hip-hop influences, but they had hard hitting guitar (unlike their last album).This is a good album, not as good as 3 dollar bill, but definitely worth a listen. Fred doesn't have the best lyrics, but he has an ear for a melody. He comes through here with a hook layden collection of good solid songs. Please give it a listen!"
5,New Limp Even better,"I have been LB fan for several years, before they were even famous. The sound to this CD is totally different from Chocolate Starfish, 3 dollar and sig. other....But fred said it was gonna be totally different, something we never heard from Limp before....and he is right! I love this CD, Just like all their others, I listen to it repeatedly, and will continue to for a long time. I bought it as soon as it went on sale, but have been listening to it on MTV.com for a week now. There is not a song on there that I don't like, and I am just glad to have Limp Back... BUY THE CD. You'll thank me later."
4,give the disc a second turn and you will see,"I would have to admit i was all hyped up about this album when i heard the news that it was coming out and then coming out again and then well pushed back yet again, of course that made me mad but i figured hey its going to rock like signifigant other and soon as i cranked it in my car i was like what the F is this [...] it got tossed to the backseat for the remander of the ride. I got enough guts to listen to it one more time and i have to say i like the album ALOT i dont know why everyone has to say limp [...] i think this is one of their more complicated albums yet and i hope they keep em coming... i would say my fav on this album has to be behind blue eyes one of my least would be head for the barricade i liked it at the start but i think it is their weakest effort on the album."
1,Worst album in the world.,"This has to be one of the dullest and most retarded albums to ever hit stores. I used to really like Limp Bizkit, they at one time were my favorite band, but I have lost all respect for them with the release of this lame excuse of an album. The lyrics on this album are absolutely retarded. Fred Durst still thinks he's cool and hardcore. In Gimme the Mic he says ""...you wantin' to hear some heavy ass metal that can penetrate deep into your ear drums? Turn it up motherf***er Turn it up motherf***er Turn it up and step into a world that you've never seen when I'm fiending for a microphone I'm a mircrophone fiend."" Unfortunately, the album is suprisingly tame and does not deliver the ""some heavy ass metal that can penetrate deep into your ear drums."" The songs are tame and very mediocre and the lyrics are about as stupid as you can get. Skip this album and buy KoRn's ""Take A Look In The Mirror"" album coming November 18th. A much better choice for anyone who listens to music."
5,IN THE TOP 5 ROCK CDS OF 2003,"BADA$$ CD. give it a chance.. it'll grow on you. Best Bizkit cd yet. Every song is good. Don't listen to the haters..they probably haven't even heard the cd, they're just hating on fred. Get it, and listen to it three or four times before you decide. 5 stars"
1,Misogynistic trash,"If Fred Durst had a brain,he'd be dangerous. RESULTS MAY VARYis basically more of the same from Limp Bizkit-a hateful knuckle-dragging celebration of idiocy bereft of a single intelligentthought. RESULTS MAY VARY made me sick."
3,Infredible D disappoints us all,"Now don't get me wrong. I'm a huge limpbizkit fan, but this cd really disappointed me. Now granted their are some really good songs on the cd,but in comparison to the other cds I liked every song from every other one of the cds, but on this cd i like maybe 7 out of 16 tracks. That's unexceptable, they should have taken those 7 plus the ones I heard from Bi-Polar like ""Crack Addict"" and ""Just Drop Dead"" and made one KICK ASS cd."
2,YO YO YO,"Granted this album does have a few high points, but for the most part it is stale and repetitive. Also has anyone else noticed the same guy has reviewed this album 50 times or so?"
1,more worthless goofy music from this lame band,I don't have to listen to this cd to know that it sucks. Fred Durst is a balding nu-metal record executive. He sounds ridiculous attempting to rap and sing because he can't do either. His lyrics sound like something a sexually frustrated 14 year boy would write. I think anyone thinking about buying this miserable music would be better off taking the money they were going to spend on this cd and use it to wipe their ass with instead.
1,THIS is what metal is all about!,God I love this album. Limp Bizkit is like the best band ever. This album is so brutal and technical. The riffs here are very difficult to play. The drum beats are over 500 bpm and the bass here is so heavy and awesome. And my god! Fred Durst's violent lyrics and vocals are awesome! Best LB album to date! Rock on Limp Bizkit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \m/For slow ones I was joking. All that needs to be said is that it's 2006 (this is an edited review) and this still ranks as The Worst. Album. Ever.God hating this band is fun ;)
3,Not Bad for a Come Back,"You guys are to hard on limp bizkit. For every who says they suck, your wrong. You may not liek the sound of their music, but the people in the band are talented at what they play. Their bass player is incredible, along with there drummer, and there new guitarist has to get the feel for it. I like this album because Limp Bizkit expanded themselves. They accepted the fact that their guitar player left, they know every one is disapointed about it, but they still try. There new album ranges from heavy rap rock to soft acoustic sounding songs. I recently saw them on the back to basics tour with korn and they were incredible live. Give this cd a chance dont just automaticly say ""o they suck since their guitar player left"". Yes their music has changed, but fred has lost his ego that he always rapped about, and has some good lyrics finally. Give it a try....Results May Vary"
4,good but not their best ( I miss Wes!),"ok first these songs are way better live so maybe my jugment is off, but i liked this cd. It it good to see that this band was able to get back after Wes Borland took off the ground while the cd has strong points like ""eat you alive"" and ""give me the mic"". It does however some really bad matterial like Fred's duet with snoop dogg ""Red Light-Green Light"". This by far the lowest point on the whole CD. It is as repeatative as it is annoying. Now don't think I say this just cause It has Snoop on it. No I like Snoop he's talented. It is just a lame a$$ song. over All this Cd is good not too many low points but it is still not good enough to be come a ""classic"". Oh Well not too bad considering the fact Fred Durst spends more time chasin after Britney instead of writin songs. On one final note: FRED were the hell is all the stuff you guys did w/ all those collaborations like w/ Head from Korn? Man that would be killer."
1,What a Dissapointment,"Ok, First things first, I didnt purchase this album, and it was the smartest move i have made in a long time. i have heard it though and the only songs i enjoy are ""Gimme the mic"", and ""Eat you alive"", the rest of the album is garbage. What happened to the song ""crack addict"" they played it at wrestlemania to hype up this album and now it doesnt appear. anyways, this band needs to listen the their original album ""three dollar bill y'all"" and then it might remind them how good they can be."
5,Where did the songs go,"Can someone help me out on this limpbizkit made two songs ""just drop dead"" and ""crack addict"" why arent they on this album and where are theyKeep It Real#1 BizKid"
1,"its limp bizkit! will always be the shiz-nit. hard core, '04","I like this album because it reminds me of how angry I was when I was 14 and my parents wouldn't by me any cool clothes so I could look bad. I hate posers, which is something Fred and I have in common. And when I was 14, I didn't know how to express my feelings, so I would shout the F word all the time, which people thought was really cool and hard core anyway. And the guitars have distortion, which is hard core. One time I did it for the nookie, which I thought touched the inner tough guy in me. I always wanted to show the world how bad I was by getting on stage with Christian Aguilara and we could all dance and try to hi-5 Eminem, who is just another whiny white boy. It's LIMP BISKIT! F***! Cool, huh? I better stop writing, it's just one of those days! Stick it up your YEAH! Stick it up your YEAH!"
3,"Lots of useful information, but poorly edited.","The author writes on the level of a 6th grader. Here's an example sentance, ""Although Windows 2000 is a secure OS, it is only as secure as you can make it"". Which literally means ""It is already as secure as you can make it"". Anyhow, you probably don't know what I'm talking about. But almost every paragraph has a mistake like this in it. Sometimes it's anoying, and sometimes its confusing. There's pretty good info in this book, I just wish it was layed out more logically. Just like with the grammar, the author seems to skip around a lot and doesn't clarify things enough. I think there's a lot of good information, and I've learned alot, but it could be much much better."
5,Great Value for the Price,"The scanner is just what I needed. It is very thin, but can expand to fit books or thick documents. You can scan or copy or save the scan. It also gives you options to determine the print quality. It was a good value for the price."
4,Good little scanner,"I upgraded to this scanner after my Lide 25 took a tumble off of an ironing board (long sory). I love it! The scan quality is great and this one is faster than the 25, in addition I can scan 3-4 pictures at once (on the other 2 was the limit). My only gripe is that the software is kind of slow. Oh well! It does what I need it to. In response to a previous review, I'm not sure if this is a modification or not but there are stickers on the scanner itself telling you to unlock it, and then on the printed instructions, followed by a prompt on your computer if you try to scan without unlocking. You just install the software plug it in, unlock it, and scan... easy."
5,LOVE IT!,"So easy to use and works very well with my Canon Pixma iP6600D printer, Mac OS X Panther software and other programs. Very happy with its smooth slim design."
2,"Scanner has problems, Canon won't fix/admit.","At first, this scanner seemed a good deal, so I bought two. Unfortunately, both scanners seem to suffer the same problem. The motor seems to stall halfway through a scan. You hear a sound like the motor backing up, then it stops. I ended up writing a small BAT file:"" cd c:\pskill -t ppscanmg.exepskill -t paprport.exeexit ""To end the scanner's driver process, then I unplug it, and replug it, and attempt to scan again. It takes me several attempts to get the thing to scan one page. I contacted CANON, but they just BS around the problem, never offering a fix.In the end, the scanner does fast good scans, when it decides to work correctly. I wish I would have bought a different brand."
4,Canon CanoScan LiDE 60 Color Image Scanner,Scanner is very good for the money. Runs a little slow scanning photos. It my also be that my computer is a bit slow.
5,great scanner / price / software,great scanner! great great great.easy setup! easy!seamless PDF creation!wow!
4,Pretty darn good scanner,"After extensive research, this was the scanner for me. I had to fuss around with its settings to get it to scan books, which isn't obvious how to do at first. Compared to the scanners I use at work, this one is fast. I can scan about 100-150 pages in an hour, including the time it takes to save the page as part of a pdf file. It's slower if you don't have USB 2.0 ports. It works great with OCR text recognition. It's slim and light, and with just one cord, it's a good space-saver. The color scanning of pictures makes the colors looks a little duller than the original print versions, but the images are crisp and clear on screen."
4,canon scanner,"Very user friendly. Dependable, lightweight and doesn't take up alot of space. I am happy with the product."
5,One of those great products that just works.,"I won't repeat the points in all the other good reviews. They're spot on. My favorite features of this scanner:1) Very slim, stores away easily.2) Draws power from the USB port on my PC. No adapter to deal with.3) The multipage PDF option. Perfect for scanning all my tax docs before they go off to the accountant. I just scan and scan, and it makes a single pdf with a page for each scan."
5,Excellent scanner,The quality is excellent. The software was easy to setup and use. The multi-scan option proved very useful for me. I will highly recommend this scanner.
5,Gauge,This item came just as expected with no problems and worked just as it was advertised to perform. It is simple to use.
3,Great Story In Need of an Editor,"This book is both a five star and a one star - an average of three. To read the 5-star book, which is a great story, a classic - just ignore all of the chapters that are not directly involved with Aron's entrapment. The core tale is compelling and evokes a personal connection between the reader and author that makes it exceptional.Old Man and the Sea? Ralston isn't Hemingway, but his essential story has that intensity. Unfortunately, it is larded over and interrupted with extraneous chapters that go on and on about the author's accomplishments as an outdoorsman and his life in general.Maybe book editors are scared of small books. Maybe it has to have a certain heft to sit properly on the supermarket checkout stand. Who knows? Some day Aron's gem of a story may be dug out and allowed to stand on its own. In the meantime, you will have to do your own excavation.....but it's worth it."
2,Death wish?,"Far from a hero, Aron seems to have a death wish and his wrecklessness has nearly gotten him killed (along with some of his friends). I hope that he can come off the adrenaline addiction (or whatever it is) and use the obvious intelligence he posesses (but apparently does not use)."
1,Never hit the backcountry or a book with Aron,"Arrogant, self indulgent, and reckless - three words that describe Aron Ralston. I don't know what I was expecting, but certainly after such an ordeal I would have thought some genuine appreciation of life would have been learned. His entire account, from the choke stone to the flashbacks, made Aron come across as someone who was ""asking"" for trouble and that his luck had finally run out. From the avalanche to the Havasupai experience, Aron never learned to respect the magnitude and power of the wilderness. This account was disappointing at best."
1,Map Sucks on Kindle,"After purchasing Ralston's work on my kindle, I began reading and was disgruntled to discover two low res, nearly worthless, maps that would be of great interest to any reader at the onset of a new story. Not a good way to kick off a new book, bummer"
1,Self-Indulgent,"I have been an avid ready for 25+ years(averaging one book per week), and this book is the first one I've been inspired to review. It was absolutely PAINFUL to read this young person's self-indulgent search for adrenaline and reckless disregard for his friend's life and limbs. He absolutely DID ""get what I asked for"". And even though he wrote those words, you don't get the sense that they are sincere. AWFUL and SHAME ON YOU ARON!"
1,Awful,"I have never been forced to review something before until I read this book. And perhaps if Aron had stuck to the events of his entrapment, I would still be able to claim a review free life. But he weaves a 320 page self inflating yarn about his life about which only his family would care.No one cares that he was top of his class, or of his reckless previous adventures. He was on the fast track to an accident and it arrived. I am only thankful that no one was hurt trying to rescue him on some stupid mountain climb. He learned nothing from his ordeal and neither will you.It causes nausea that society has rewarded this fool with book and movie deals for being stupid and arrogant. He is a joke. And so is the book... do not read it. You get to read so few books in a lifetime that you should not waste even a second on this one. I regret it...."
3,"Incredible Tale, Incredible Courage, Incredibly Horrid Writing","PRO:An inspiring story of courage and survival. Reading about the experience (when he finally gets to it) left me awestruck.CON:The writing is narcissistic, pretentious drivel."
3,Somewhat Boring,"Throughout the writing, Aron Ralston constantly strays from the actual plot. The book has constant flashbacks to his past adventures become monotonous after the first few chapters. The main storyline of is entrapment was very interesting. The fact that he was able to survive for so long in the Moab desert is nothing short of a miracle. All in all I enjoyed the book, despite some boring chapters that strayed from the point."
4,follow your bliss,"This is a wonderful book by a clearly remarkable individual. Ralston successfully intertwines prior experiences with his accident in Utah, to give the reader tremendous insight into the many wilderness experiences that shaped him.At times, the book gives fairly detailed technical renderings of mountaineering experiences, and these passages can be difficult. However, these sections can be easily 'skimmed through' by the non-mountaineer, and most probably savored by those with more hiking/climbing experience.What makes this book valuable to every reader, including ones who may never face seemingly insurmountable physical challenges, is Ralston's -Joseph Campbell inspired- message of ""follow your bliss."" It will be the unusual reader who does not finish this book feeling as if they must closely examine their own life, and the course it is taking."
5,Adventure,It is better than the movie because there more of a background story prior to and during the accident. Really good book.
5,Amazing story,Great book. What an inspiration! Read this during my marathon training and it sure put things in perspective. How hard can 26.2 miles be if this guy can go through hell?Quick read. Get a used copy; dont waste your $ on a new one. You'll be done reading it in a few days and then it just sits on your shelf.
2,"I wanted to like this book, but...","While I admire Aron's strength to get through a situation I would not have, there were simply too many issues with this book to give it a good review. Like many others, I found him to come across as quite arrogant. Especially the ending about how all the media wanted to talk to him, the concerts, etc-. I wish he would have learned a bigger lesson than ""It's not what you do"" (and even that felt hollow). His flashbacks to past adventure trips were boring (sorry). Later on, i ended up skipping those chapters b/c i just found him to be a thrill seeker & not very admirable. It was interesting to see the background of the search, and what his parents & friends were going though -- that was probably the best part of it & those bits really weren't about him. Again, with all due respect, I wish I could give this a better review..."
5,Inspiring young man creates the miracle that saves his own life,"Every young person from the age of 10 and forward, should read this inspiring story of how a courageous young man created the miracle that saved his own life. This is an amazing true story of an event that could happen to any rock climber. Even if you never climb a rock in your life, this story will take you to this young man's accidental situation, a life or death struggle, and his monumental will to survive, to see his family again."
4,Truly Compelling,"Aron's story is one of fear, frustration, bravery and a willingness to survive that is truly captivating. His composure in the face of sure death is an inspiration."
3,"EVERYBODY CAN WRITE, RIGHT?","This guy's got a great story to tell. But if you know what good writing is, it is nearly impossible to read its overwritten purple prose.What Aron and every other new writer needs to learn, is that, despite what your high school teacher told you, writing 'dramatically' is not the most effective way to convey real drama. The best way, Aron, is to state your story simply without embellishment and to permit the reader to be moved by your story.If you can ignore the writing, it's an interesting story."
2,"A pastepot book, with contempt for the reader","The subject, through stupidity, incompetence, and arrogance, got himself stuck in the wilderness and had to cut off a good hunk of one of his lower arms. He has cashed in on his stupidity and misfortune by becoming an ""inspirational speaker."" (Maybe he could also endorse Swiss Army knives, eh?)His book offered a golden opportunity for him to do some good for the world. He had been asked to include a major section of advice for other hikers, on how to prepare, safety, what to take with you, etc. To hell with other people, figured the author; no such useful information was included.The book itself is a pretty good account, though the whole book is pretty skimpy for the price."
2,marks on the book,"This book arrived with black marks all over it. I guess for the price it's good enough to read it, but really it should be marked ""used"" if it is going to arrive in this condition."
4,amazing story of a risk-taker,"Someone told me that 127 Hours was ""so much better than the movie"", which I intended to eventually see when it comes to DVD. So I picked up the book for a week vacation in Costa Rica and read it in...less than 127 hours. Say, 6 1/2 hours. I do not relate to the author who likes to do scary stuff by himself, but his reflections on why he is ""out there in nature"" make sense to me. The process he goes through after he is stuck is incredibly pragmatic and soul-searching. A good read."
3,great story but not a great book,"ive read a lot of survival books and articles. aron ralstons story almost always pops up. ive read/heard his (basic) story a lot of times so i was super excited to finally read his book. maybe i had my hopes set too high but it just wasnt that great. maybe its just me. hes an entirely different person than i so i really couldnt relate. i just couldnt shake my impression of him being a pot smoking hippy. the writing was mediocre as well. he did what had to be done! hes a survivor no doubt!! im sure, one hell of a man!!! but the book is just ok."
2,beware! huge ego within.,"Although the story of Aron's self rescue is remarkable, he got himself into the predicament by ignoring several cardinal rules of safe and (for potential rescuers) RESPONSIBLE wilderness travel. This book is interesting but this reader was disappointed after reading page after page of congratulatory, shameless egotistical self promotion of his adventures and meaningless accomplishments. So what if he's the first person to solo all Colorado's fourteeners in winter? But I'll give Ralston credit: he does finally say that it was his own stupidity and cavalier disregard for common-sense rules of safety (""leave details of your destination with a responsible person"") that got him into his desparate situation, and he showed considerable courage in getting himself out of a pretty big jam (no pun intended)."
4,Good book,This book was very well written and I enjoyed it. The only complaint I have is that the amputation is a litte descriptive and gory. Not for the sensitive. However I know that this was a part of the account and must be put into the story. Overall really good book
4,Just amazing,I really enjoyed this book except for all the climbing detail...too many geographic names of climbing places and such just made my eyes glaze over. He is a true inspiration of the desire to survive.
4,vivid read and true tale of survival,Great read and tale of someone who managed to survive a harrowing experience. Recommended to people who like to get immersed in one mans adventure struggle
5,"Inspiring, couldn't put it down!","This book was phenomenal. If you are a fan of survivor stories, this book is for you. Not only is Aron's story truly remarkable, but sprinkled throughout the book are more stories from Aron's adventures. Truly a courageous and exceptional man with incredible character. (And Aron, I too share your love of the greatest band in the world- Phish ;), and Trey!) Can't recommend this book enough!!"
2,So dry and dull...like the desert air he experienced..,"Honestly, it was a great documentary if you are interested in his story but nothing truly exciting happens until the last chapter or two of the story...it's so dull to begin with and for me, it was quiet painful to read. I am happy he made it out alive and it's pretty inspirational, but what makes his story so much better than anyone else whose had a tragic accident and lived? Well...if you want to know so bad, put yourself in the agonizing pain and read this 300 page story."
1,Annoying,"The author relates many of his previous experiences in addition to being trapped under a rock. He was so careless/reckless, he could have been the inspiration for dumb and dumber. The only surprise in this book is that the author survived as many things as he did. By buying this book, you actually contribute or reinforce the authors stupidity."
2,Gear Head,"""It's not what you do, it's who you are."" I know a lot of people like Aron. They live very exciting lives, but they always wind up gettting hurt. We all have choices and life is what you make of it. When you fall down, get back up. If you write a book - please focus on the important things. If you set out to prove something - prove it to yourself. Don't make the same mistakes twice and really think about what you're doing before something bad happens. And when someone says they will meet up with you later and they don't, please WORRY about them. Everyone should get out there and experience life, but if you're going to do it alone don't do anything stupid. There are lots of things to learn from Aron's story. And after all that he has done he still seems very positive about life. I think that is the most important thing about the book. Lots of fluff, but an inspiration nonetheless."
2,"Courageous, but thank goodness your mother looked for you!!","Hi I read the book, and even though Aron Ralston is very courageous and all that, the lesson here is, tell someone where you are going, especially if it entails something dangerous! In the end, his mother is the one who worried about him the most and started the search. He is amazing in all the things he's done, the joys of having boys...."
2,Mixed Bag,"Aron Ralston has had an admittedly unique experience. He had to amputate his own hand to save his life. What is missing amidst all the hoopla and notoriety surrounding this amazing story is that he engineered his own predicament through a combination of stupidity and hubris. The actual circumstances leading up to and through his ordeal are interesting and, at time, riveting. However, the author takes what should be a magazine sized story , and expands it to book length by padding it with the boring and suffocatingly self indulgent ""story of my life"". Well, the story of Aron Ralston's life is one all too familiar in the world of ""me first."" I finally had to skip long passages of ""his love affair with himself"" to get to the heart of the story. My suggestion: wait for the Reader's Digest version."
2,"Interesting event, horrible book","I was very interested in reading about his ordeal, but was quickly put off by the book. The writing is very forced and unnatural. He is also very self absorbed and describes himself and everything in his life as the best, biggest, hardest, most amazing thing ever. He should have had someone else write his story, and his editor proabably needs to find another job."
2,Wait for the made-for-tv movie,"There isn't anything of importance in this book that wasn't already covered by the news media. Lots of filler material describing past misadventures that left me with the feeling that this kid does stupid, dangerous things just to get an exciting story to tell his friends. Way too much ego caressing. I'm sure Aron will be in the news again - I just hope we don't hear of others that were with him or of those that had to rescue/recover him."
2,What an idiot,"I really wanted to be inspired with this book, but after plodding through it, it just made me totally disgusted with Aron. Total disregard for all the mistakes he's made and continues to do the same stupid things over and over again. It didn't help that I also saw him on the show 60 minutes. What a total narcissist! Hate to admit it and not to sound racist, but Caucasian people never learn from their near death experiences with nature - they just get right back to what ever stupid thing they're doing!"
2,what all the 1 and 2 star reviews said.......,"yep......this guy is full of himself......i thought the part where he detailed all the people he wanted to have part of his ashes and all the places he wanted them to go to spread them was a bit much..... as well as telling his sister, I guess in video he made, if she still wanted him to play at her wedding (even though he was dead) she could find old piano rehearsal tapes of his in the basement was beyond egotistical....I mean, come on dude..... I was happy to see his admission of being a control freak and complaining about his after care in there tho....he IS human.....I actually thought a lot more of him BEFORE i read this book than I did after......glad this was from the library for sure. I wonder who ended up marrying him and what kind of personality she has? I don't think I could tolerate living with someone who has such a high opinion of himself for very long...."
5,Intriguing Story,"I think Aron Ralston retold his story very well. I like how he switched between the past and the present. I was unfamiliar with the story so I was anxious to find out how he got out of his predicament. I thought it was sad that in the end he gives credit to some unknown spiritual force in the universe rather than giving thanks to God Almighty for the strength to endure and the perfect timing to escape with help on the way. I hope to remember his plight when I'm struggling with a physical limitation. If he can do what he did, then certainly I can endure a sinus infection."
5,127 hours,My brother loves these books! He hikes a lot & loves reading about the adventures of others. The book arrived when promised for his birthday.
5,Perfect!,"Strametto or rather James Allen seems to have a gripe against Moonshine must be a frustrated unreleased DJ I guess. The guy couldn't be more far from the truth. Cirrus have come back with a stella produced album that has seen a substantial development in their style. This album is worth the money for the track ""Half A Cell"" alone, you then get at least 4 more classics with no fillers."
2,Did I miss something?,"It just happens to be pure chance that I have run across Cirrus' CD Countefeit. Unfortunately, I only pop It in to hear ""Hit the Decks, Intermission, and Straight Laid Out"" which is a dissappointment. Maybe I haven't become accustomed to his style to be able to appreciate this yet or it might be that I'm searching for something else. I look forward to the past CDs for guidance."
1,What the hell happened to this band?,"Yikes,is this the same band that did ""Back on a Mission""? Thanks but no thanks."
1,A book with no audience?,"Looking for a supplementary text for my Numerical Analysis course, I had my students pick up this text- I have found that other Outlines give a lot of excellent worked examples and provide good summaries- Not this text. If you are a beginning student, go get yourself a real text (I would highly recommend Burden and Faires, or the new text by Tim Sauer). This text offers little to no insight into the algorithms or the analysis, and spends way too much space on one dimensional interpolation problems. If you're simply looking for summaries of algorithms and practical advice on implementation, a much better text is the ""Numerical Recipes"" books. In summary, I'm not sure who the audience is for this book- There are many, much better, options out there."
2,The worst of all Schaums guides,"there are several problems with using this book as self-study material:1) it is dated - though published in 1989, and by definition out of date in 2010, the first 11 chapters list many techniques that even in that period are condsidered to be of historical interest in the computer age - interpolation, collocation operators etc2) there is not a single worked example3) the solved problems make several leaps of logic - I wouldnt have got anywhere without referencing Wikipedia, Cliffs briefs on differential equations, Schuams advanced calculus etc.4) sometimes new formulas are actually introduced in worked problems - eg Everet's formula5) problems are not self contained - referencing other chapters, other problems and sometimes other problems in other chapters.In short, this book was a struggle, and although it will give you conceptualization of different techniques, it will not give you a modern or holistic perspective on the field."
5,le meilleur des annees,"I discover Michel fugain in the early 70's when he was singing with the big bazar,for about 30 plus years, I did not ear michel, thanks for Amazon I can enjoy ""unebelle histoire"",""comme un soleil"". Le meilleur des annees is a wonderful album Iwould recommend it to any lover of french retro music..."
2,Not John Lee Hooker,"Well, of course it is John Lee Hooker, but these slick, mushy recordings are very, very far from Hooker's gritty 40s, 50s and 60s waxings, and songs like the saccahrine, string-laden ""Six-Page Letter"" are even wussier than the worst of his late 80s/early 90s guest star recordings. Hooker obviously didn't have a chance to listen to the final mixes.Whatever you do, make sure you listen to this album before buying it!"
5,The perfect spoon,"Loved my first one so much that I ordered another. Sturdy, dish washer safe - the prefect combination. Recommended by Cook's Country."
5,Perfect for Soups,Bought this spoon to go with my big soup pot. The handle never gets hot and it's nice and long for tall/deep pots! Works great!
1,Spoon doesn't last!,"Although I enjoyed using this spoon in the beginning, at the ripe old age of 6 months the silicone edge cracked numerous times, making them now useless. The cracks gathered numerous bits of food in them (not to mention bacteria) before I discovered them which I'm sure wasn't healthy! These spoons are for show, but not for use. They simply don't last."
5,My 'Go To' Spoon,"I have an array of stainless steel, bamboo, melamine, and vinyl spoons and spatulas in my drawer and when this one's clean, it is the one I *always* grab for first. I mix with it. I cook on the stove with it, and it always works well. Never a worry whether or not my non-stick will be damaged yet still heavy and sturdy enough that it stands up to my stainless and cast iron cookware.. I bought this at the same time I bought a Tovolo rubber spatula which began to flake off chunks of silicone almost immediately. I almost returned them both thinking that this one would probably be falling apart very soon as well, but I'm glad I only returned the spatula. This thing is really holding up well and it gets used a LOT."
3,Hot handles!,"Though the spoon part of this is really nice, the handles get really hot so I end up not using them nearly as often as I would like. I'd love to find some silicone spoons with wood handles instead."
5,Nice spoon,"I bought part of this set (Tongs, spatula and whisk) at Williams-Sonoma, but they were out of the spoons. I'm glad I found it on Amazon and it was cheaper than what I paid for the others."
1,buggy & bad customer service,"This program simply does not work correctly. Program has many bugs and they are not responsive. In fact, their customer service, by email, and by phone is even worse than the usual poor service one gets on tech lines. DO not waste your money."
2,Smoke And Mirrors,"This program does not follow the instruction manual. Many times I went,""by the book"" only to find out alot of dead ends. You have to spend hours to get even a simple website up. Forget trying to add music background. And tech support? Yeah right, they dont respond to your emails. You cant even call them collect! Would not buy again."
4,Great afternoon Beach read.,Night Whispers by Leslie Kelly is a quick romance story. Kelsey and Mitch have known each other for since they were children. Kelsey was always the pest and sister to his best friend. Now she is rented a floor in his house and doing a sexual radio show. Mitch has a hard time seeing Kelsey as the women she has become. Very cute read!
5,"Smart, Sexy, and Lots of Fun--A Definite Keeper!","Don't miss this wonderful debut from Harlequin Temptation's brightest new star! NIGHT WHISPERS grabbed me from the first page and never let go. Between the main characters' non-stop chemistry and Ms. Kelly's razor-sharp writing style, this book is a definite keeper! I can't wait for her next book!"
2,A promising spark that fizzled out....,"You can read the other reviews for the book synopsis. I just finished it (finally) and it left me flat - literally can't remember the main characters' names. Even though it was a small book of a little over 200 pages it still seemed to drag on forever. There was no ""mystery"" to the ""mystery"". No sizzle to the sex. The romance had a couple of cute sparks ... that didn't go anywhere. The book just seemed tedious. I've read much better works from this author. I give it a ""pass""."
2,Overpriced,"For [price], I expected more than this book delivers. The book presents nutshells that inadequately summarize various portions of scriptures from various faith traditions. While not identified to a specific book of scripture, most of this information is available far more cheaply and with greater depth from any of the world religion books on the market by authors Huston Smith, Ninian Smart, or Mircea Eliade or publishers Eerdmans, St. Martins, or Harper San Francisco. For the money charged here, the encyclopedia should visit major topics in the world's scriptures such as the state of human existence, salvation, or the character of the supreme and provide a summary annotated to each tradition's scripture. While the encyclopedia provides other information on sources, the same information is available more cheaply from Joel Beversuis's ""Sourcebook of the World's Religions."" Overall, I was greatly disappointed."
4,Inspirational,"A small hardcover book used as a gift or birthday card. It is filled with commentary, poetry, psalms and quotes from scripture all relevant to the celebration of life. The inspirational scripture quotes are adapted from the King James version of the Bible. Of course when received as a gift it is priceless."
2,"Good content, poor production values","The content of the instructional DVD is very good. George Alexander goes through the etiquette, forms, basic drills, and even some sparring. Great information for someone to get a better understanding of kendo before making the decision to start classes.That said, the quality of the presentation is poor. The sound quality is bad, the scenes have poor lighting, and the presenter stumbles through the scripted portions. Frankly, this DVD looks like it was made with the same care and attention to detail that one would apply to filming a child's birthday party."
4,"THUMP, THUMP, THUMP....A good mix",This 2 disc CD set is perfect for people who want to start listening to the Chemical Brothers music but don't know where to start. Fans of the Chemical Brothers probably won't get too much out of this set since they have heard most of this already.
4,Good compilation,"I didn't have any album from Chemical Brothers so I decided to buy this. Well I am happy with it, many hits and good songs. Anyway I was expecting something more... commercial. What I mean is, there are some songs mostly the hits that you can listen to without being a Chemical Brothers fan; but there are others that I felt it was too much for me. Those kind of songs you say ""this is why I can't listen a complete album from this guys"".Anyway, you want something from Chemical Brothers? Take this!"
3,Look elsewhere for good breakbeat,"There's far more talented breakbeat producer/djs for your dollar than the Chemical Brothers. Oversexed, underwhelming, and just plain mediocre- there's a reason you won't find a single Chemical Brothers side in my record box despite spinning breakbeat for years.Check out the Y4K series instead: Hyper, Tayo, Freq Nasty, and Koma & Bones are surefire brilliance both in the studio and on the decks. For those who like reggae and hip hop flavours, FreQ Nasty delivers the goods. For those who like more progressive, trance, and electro, Koma & Bones installment in the series was groundbreaking. Both Hyper and Tayo put together more varied sets that are sure to please.Cheers."
2,"Words, Words, Words...","I have not gotten much out of this commentary.The author is a ""word study"" guy, which some people love but not me. I found most observations in the book were restatements of the obvious or a plain restatement of the text without much insight or theological probing.The writing is a bit dull for me and I dropped out after about 2/3s of the way. So, my review is not based on the complete book."
1,Imagine this ....,"Ok, the core of this story is like a rolled up piece of clear tape (Sticky side out). And now imagine this tape is being rolled across your carpet picking up stray pits of lint or cat hair etc...those bits are the bits of plot points and story progression you pick up as you read.The tape goes around and around, starting at one point, completing a revolution and ending back at that same point only now it has a bit of lint on it. It repeats this process,again, and again... but now the instead of one piece of lint you have many pieces of lint.And in the end you can't believe you read this book instead of vaccuming."
1,Full of sentences,"Where was the adjectives to this story. It seemed to just go from one thought to another with very little descriptiveness to it. He said this, then did that... I had no feelings for any charactor at all. This is how a couple of her books have read to me... like there was no emotion put into writing them. It makes me wonder if Connie was under a deadline and she was just trying to hurry and make the publisher happy. I have every book she has written. I haven't read them all because there are several other books that are written the same way. Usually I love her books...but the last two have really been boring from page one!"
2,Didn't like it.,"Since the book has been summarized, I will explain why I didn't like it.First, I never felt, even at the end, that the hero really loved her. It seemed like it was all based on his lust for her.Then there was a lot of sub-conflicts going on as well such as: his lust and bitterness towards the heroine, her brother and Rigby's schemes, the slave revolt, the hurricane, the h/h past that tortures their relationship, is he cheating on her?, is she pregnant?, she's a wanted criminal in London etc., was all too much for me. They just went on and on.Then after all of those conflicts, they are miraculously resolved in but a few pages.It took me about four days to read this book which is unheard of. Save your money and pass on ""A Taste Of Paradise""."
1,[Skip] this book,"Eric J. Horst violated local land owners by publishing their private properties against their expressed wishes not to. In the climbing world access is always a big issue, and Mr. Horst is [messing]it up for us all. Help keep our area's open for business, and [skip] this bood. If you need help in virginia, try Virginia Climber's Guide. It is a good enough substitute, but please support our community by finding a substitute for this book."
1,Some truth,I will be brief.I have climbed at many of these areas since the mid seventies. If you do not have the right info then do not make it up just to sell a book. It would make it much easier on the rest of us not to keep answering the same questions or showing folks where the route actually begins and not from the Bible.
2,very basic guide,This guide is not very good. We bought during our trip to Seneca rocks and quickly discovered that it was totaly useless. It only covers major areas and descriptions and directions are preety bad. If you are looking for good climbing guide for Maryland get 'Climb Maryland' by Indy Kochte
2,Not So Deep Tonight!,"I love Deep Banana Blackout. Their album ""Feel The Peel"" is easily one of my all-time favorites. I purchased realse the grease expecting the same kind of energetic funk with complex horn lines and funky vocals. While the album has its good moments, the vocals are ocasionally off pitch and the songs lack the complexities and soul of previous albums. and the final big bottom cover is just stupid. maybe they broke up for the better. Sorry guys, but you shoulda stuck to the peel."
2,disappointed DBB fan,"I've been following DBB for a few years now. I bought this album after admiring the other live album ""ROWDY DOWDY"" (which was incredible). But unfortunately ""RELEASE THE GREASE"" fails to convey the band's tremendous energy onstage. The sound quality is not the best (as is often an issues with live albums) and die-hard fans of Jen's renditions of the earlier songs may be disappointed - this album lacks some of the earlier albums' funky grit. If you want to hear DBB live - SEE A SHOW!!! - or purchase ""ROWDY DOWDY""... but pass on this album."
1,some things to look into.,"I have not read this book, but I could probably tell you just about everything it says. Research two things regarding this. ""The Myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy"" and the writings and actions of Jefferson Davis and General Jubal Early in the years following the Civil War. You will find an organized, systematic propaganda campaign that covered reasons for the war and justifications for succession and for the barbaric para-military campaigns carried out by Nathan Bedford Forest and others under the banner of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan against Afirican-Americans. When you make a statement regarding slavery that lessens the fact that it was a dehuminizing, cruel, barbaric, unethical, and unChristian institution, then you are making a dehumanizing statment too."
2,NOT ITEM PICTURED!!,"The picture of the product and the description do NOT match! The picture is of the Crab Island Climb and Hide and you will receive the Climbing Background, which is not even close to the same. If you are looking to buy what is pictured, look somewhere else!"
2,Crabs love it...I do not!,"I have 6 smaller sized hermit crabs and they started climbing on it the minute I put it in their terrarium. The problem is that the velcro doesn't hold it up at all, I even purchased different velcro and it still peals off and falls down even when the crabs aren't using it."
1,Trex climbing background,It looked nothing like the background pictured for the ad.Looks cheaply made to boot!I was expecting a foam background with climbing cutouts but got flat coconut fiber instead!
1,Can get it much cheaper!,"The 1 star is for the price, not product...This product has been available for years. Recently it has been difficut to find in local stores. It's perfect for dorm or desk use...tea, instant coffe, soup, oatmeal, etc.However, it can be purchased @ BB&B; for $19 and the %20 coupon discounts it to about $17 with tax. The shipping was waived because I ordered it from the store.It's a nice product, but Amazon having the best price with shipping at $29 is close to double what you can get it for. The other on-line vendor prices are even worse! I have gotten some great buys from Amazon, but this is not one of them."
2,Boring - bad music,"This video has a great premise. It just doesn't deliver. All shots are similar, not personal interviews or stories, no locational footage. Soundtrack is bad. I fell asleep watching this. If you don't already own ""That's it, that's all,"" buy it instead of this!"
3,"Great mixes, but...","OK, I'm a dance music junkie, and I love Joi Cardwell. This is a fun song to get you moving. But what is up with this gargantuan remixes these days? The best mix on this disc is great, but it clocks in at nearly 11 minutes long. Hey, not all of us have mixers where we can sequence songs on a tape or to be burnt on a disc! It seems every dance mix I have purchased recently has to have at least one mix that's at least 10 minutes long...that's just too long and you get burnt out quickly. If this doesn't bother YOU, however, then you'll like this disc. It contains the original, a good (but LONG!) remix and a dub."
5,Amazing how well the Stones transfer so well to other styles of music,"This CD is great, it shows how dynamic the original music was when you can do these songs in country,blus,pop,etc, and now Bossa, and they all sound like thats the style they were written for.The fist three songs, and satisfaction are fantastic, and perfectly done. The Ruby tuesday remix is a little different, but is intersting. The artist who sang Angie was not the best choice, she sounds like a little girl and it takes away from an otherwise great song. The only negative thing I can say is that one of my favorite songs, and potentially one of the best songs for this project, Brown Sugar, also has a poor choice of vocalist, as she tries so hard to hard to sound caucasion it sounds like she was told to say suGAR, like cigar. The obvious language issue detracts from the enjoyablity of this song. BUT they wrap it up with antother really nice song version of Wild Horses. If you like cover music, you will love this CD."
4,Stones with Brazilian taste,I have every single album The Rolling Stones have done and hear Stones music in my car almost every day (I have all their music in my Ipod).I think this album is great collection of the Rolling Stones songs perfomanced with the smooth and sensuality typical of Brazilian music.Simply a Great Album
1,Disappointing,"I had purchased Rita Lee's Bossa N Beatles in Argentina and it was such a good album that I thought I'd try another. Maybe it was because Rita Lee's album is so good, but I found this to be a big disappointment. Mainly, to me, the singers' voices become grating after a listen or two, and I just can't listen to it anymore."
1,seriously???,"I don't know how anyone can appreciate this...its so pathetic, it makes me cringe everytime I hear it. No one who actually is a rolling stones fan would ever enjoy this music"
1,Rendering them Lifeless,"Being a classic Rolling Stones fan, I stretched out for this album and took it home - to be sorely disapointed. Really with only the single exception of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" there is nothing worthy here. As the Editorial review says - quite a unique experience.... then again so is chewing glass - it just is not particularly pleasant."
5,comment riviene a ma ville?,"je dois dire avant de commencer mon resumen que si je dois choisir un livre de albert camus, bien sur que je choisire c'est roman parce que il nous present un albert jeunne et un peux diferen, un albert très simple et très vital."
5,Truth Prevails,Darwin's tightly held theories on natural selection are let loose to a resistant public but a public that was also proud of their intellectuals. Darwin's network of scientific friends and associates provide strength to a highly disruptive theory and in so advance their own scientific careers.
5,Do You Need This?,"Just a note: All 3 of the Wolf_Garten hand tools that I bought on Amazon came with a detachable handle anyway for free. You may not this unless you want it for other WG tools you already have. This handle is about 2 inches longer than the one that you get for free, which doesn't really change the way I would use it for my hand tools. Perhaps the extra inches would matter for larger tool heads, but I would not thinks so."
4,Per ardua ad astra,"Stalking Anubis: Engaging characters, sharp observation, a cool sense of wit, and a plot that hooks the reader early in the book. And who wouldn't fall in love with a femme fatale with a crossbow? As a mystery writer and astrologer, I found this book was right up my alley. Providing crisp action and dialog, wry observations and a deft hand with humor, Steven Forrest delivers the goods in this mystery featuring astrologer Plato Mims and a friend who is framed for the murder of his own father. Although there wasn't as much astrology in this book as I was expecting, the use of it was very clever and did justice to the stellar arts. Per ardua ad astra!- Alan Annand (author of Scorpio Rising)"
2,Clarification - Shea Disc,"Just to let everyone know who's a fab fan, the soundtrack for most of this concert was overdubbed by them 2 weeks later. They watched the movie and sang/played to a movie screen while they watched it. The sound levels were not audible due the screaming plus the amplification equipment they used (Vox) was not strong enough. They were at 2nd base on the field!If you have a cd of this, which I do, you can tell, listen to the drumming, it's too clear on some tracks to be live. Some of it is but Ticket To Ride I can definitively say is not.Just wanted you to know, it's a great visual to have until someone does something more to try to enhance it."
3,The Beatles-Live At Shea Stadium,Interesting but not as crisp as the scenes in Anthology.The copy from film to DVD lost quality.Also has quick clips from the cow palace in San Francisco in very bad quality.But it is a must have for a Beatle fan
1,Sound and video quality suck,"I guess if you're the kind of person who has to have everything Beatles, it's an okay purchase.But the sound and video are very poor quality, and the only thing you can really hear well is the screaming of teenage girls in the crowd. I wish someone could find some really high quality concert footage of the Beatles to share with the world, 'cause this aint it."
4,Very interesting author,"Searching through the Kindle store for books by Stephen Baxter, I came across this title for which Baxter wrote the forward. I bought it on impulse and was very glad I did. I find that reading short story collections is a good way to get to know an author before investing time and effort into reading novels, especially series. The stories in this collection were all well written and contained story ideas I have not come across before."
5,"The demo of ""Two Grey Rooms"" alone is worth the price!","I put these cd's in the car and was listening to so many of my favorite songs when I ran across the demo version of Two Grey Rooms, released on the Night Ride Home album but recorded during the Wild Things Run Fast sessions. Always one of my favorite Joni songs, in this version she sings ad lib vocalizations- no lyrics. It's absolutely stunning. The sweeping lush orchestration, the (real) piano and the recording are superb. Joni's rich voice sounds as if recorded in a cavernous hall rich with depth. This song one of my most prized Joni Mitchell songs ever. Thank you for releasing this beautiful jem."
2,For ardent fans only,"If you're new to Joni Mitchell-don't look here.Apart from Night Ride Home and about half the tracks on Wild Things... this is a poor selection of her talent.I've never been able to listen to Chalk Mark or Dog Eat Dog albums without cringing, despite the fact that musically Joni is in my top 3 artists of all time.Only buy this if you want the demo tracks and the packaged photos and notes; otherwise borrow copies of seperate CD's before you decide. To me, it's just a marketing ploy to rake in the dollars for the unreleased demo's. An expensive investment for little return."
3,Just a teleprompter,"Music is ok. No video, from the movie or otherwise. The prompts don't include text for supporting/secondary vocals."
4,Recommended,"This is an incredibly beautiful book, with improvements over the first Best of Pastel: one large picture per page, and two captions for each--an artist's statement about the painting, and a few words about technique and style. The works chosen for the book are diverse, and show the artists' range and considerable skill. The only downer, in my view, is the ""Critiquing Your Own Work"" section at the end. Though it contains valuable information for beginning and perhaps advanced pastellists, it is written in such a snobby and condescending manner it puts a sour ending to an otherwise very sweet book."
1,VERY touchy CD player,"If you are thinking about using this to play CDs, DON'T. First, it takes anywhere between 15 seconds and three minutes for the CD player to ""read"" the CD and begin playing it once you put it in. Once it does start playing, if you put the handle down with anything but a feather touch, the CD stops playing and you have to turn it off, turn it on, and wait another 3 minutes for it to read the CD again. Ditto for if you are carrying the boom box while it plays and it swings AT ALL, if it's on the floor and you walk next to it, if a stiff breeze blows by it, etc. I just printed out a return label . . .this one's going back home to papa."
3,popular bands/singers circa 1980,"this is a 125 page paperback book about popular bands and singers in the year of our lord,nineteen hundred andeighty-seems like not that long ago does it? this book gives basic info/photos of various pop/rock people like:donnasummer,andy gibb,little river band,barry manilow,the eagles,ELO,supertramp,bob seger,etc. each one has a ""mimi-bio"" and vital statistics(which may or may not be accurate)and speaking of this particular feature of the book,ithink this book is leaning more towards teenagers rather than adults. i think only teens are interested what eyecolor dennis de young(of the rock group styx)has! the only one hit wonder of the book is,""the knack"",remember...""muh,muh,muh-my sharona""???,yep,seems like yesterday."
1,Chinese Jars,"basically the two jars i received has nothing to do with the picture in the site, it will be good if the show a 360 degree picture.. not even the lead was similar to the one i saw on the picture. it wasnt oval shape. - im really not happy with this purchase."
5,The World of Design in One Inspiration-Filled Book,"Creativity 33 is an excellent guide for anyone looking for a concise overview of contemporary design practices in a variety of media.As is often true with books edited by David Carter, the quality of the choices is only matched by their presentation on the page. Each oversize page contains three to eight reproductions of various types of print projects as well as online examples. Illustrations are large enough to teach meaningful lessons.Samples are grouped by category. Printing and production values are high. The tinest details clearly emerge.Thumbing through the book, one of my first impressions is the power that comes from the simplicity of the designs and the designer's use of color.This book would make a great ""sample book"" for internal training of a design studios' staff, as well as a framework for a semester-long commercial graphic design course or workshop."
4,Great way to exercise,"I have osteoarthritis in both hips and broke a bone in my right foot, so exercising can be painful for me. I tried this DVD for toning up and found it to be just what I need. I plan to order one of the Chair Dancing DVD's to get more exercise from the comfort of my chair."
4,Virtuoso sax playing,"NOt a fusion record, Gem Tomes displays the deep relationships betweemn Indian classical music and modern improvisational jazz. The players follow a style of playing the 'head' and imporvising about the theme that is common to both forms. Here, the saxophone of Kadri Gopalnath makes these affiinities even more clear; Indian melody, when played on the sax, sounds extraordinarily familiar to the Western ear, but when paralelled by Indian classical violin, it is obviously part of the indian tradition.Amazing and refreshing listening."
5,Insanely good!!,"Don't judge this album by its cover or its dull title. The music is amazing. I listened to it on repeat when I first got it. Kadri is famous in India, maybe not as well known outside India? If you like western sax or Indian music, you will enjoy this album."
5,Saxophone Supreme Indeed!,"This is 100% traditional South Indian (Carnatic) music. Although the sax is the main instrument it in no way sounds like it's European or American incarnations. This collection of ragas was recorded live-in-studio in 1997 in London while Mr. Gopalnath was on tour - the tasteful accompaniment by Ms Kanyakumari on violin and percussionists Mr's Sainatha and Rajasekar on mridangam and morsing respectively, are equally virtuosic.This is modern Indian music at it's best - lively and playful but also deeply rooted in tradition. Extensive liner notes about the musicians, their instruments and musical heritage as well as details about each track are a nice plus.Highly recommended for fans of both traditional Indian and just plain intoxicating music!"
5,"nice, reasonable priced night light","I had hoped that it would project the stars and planet shapes on the walls when turned on, but it didn't, also it's actually a little bright. Still, I'm pleased with it and my boys love it too."
4,Extremely powerful.,When I was listening to this recording I could feel my nerves going raw. It was a cry and it was a joy. It was a calling from the past. It was full of memory.
3,Derivative,"The performances are excellent and often stirring, but the compositions are basically reworkings of familiar melodies, tropes, and techniques. ""Yiddishbuk"" is the standout piece among these, employing some of the same techniques that Schnittke and Penderecki used in the 1970s; the rest is milder stuff, evocative but unoriginal. If you have a taste for John Adams or Darius Milhaud, you'll probably like this--it's rich, melodic, emotional, and kitschy. But Golijov is no Bartok--when it comes to folk material, he's simply not astringent enough for my taste, and when it comes to original ideas, I'm not sure if he has any. There's quite a bit of Jewish and Eastern European content here, but I'd rather listen to old klezmer recordings or Communist-era Romanian pop (not to mention almost anything by Bartok, Schnittke, Ligeti, or Gubaidulina) than this. It's too second-hand."
4,Mail Order Entrepreneur's Need This Book!,"Great, serious, honest, money-making ideas in this book! Use them and profit from them! ..."
3,Not a bad little book,"A good novel by Beth Moore. Could it have been better? Yes. Better editing was needed in places, and some of the character development was a bit on the weak side. I had trouble with Ann's character doing a complete 180 degree turn in how she acted toward women and sex in the last half of the book. I can't picture her character doing what she did. Casey's character was pretty well developed. And her family was awesome. Some of the plotlines were tied up too neatly (re: Ann's mother), and Moore used more exposition/description/sumarization when dialogue was needed. All in all, a decent book, and with some better editing, she'll be putting out even better stuff in the future."
1,Awful Game. Total waste of time and money.,"Save your money. I play Texas Hold'em regularly and I can tell you that this game is a total waste of time and money. I would rate it Zero if I could.Not intuitive. Slow and awkward to use. Doesn't work with Mac OSX. How any competent reviewer could rate this almost completely unplayable turkey of a game, anything above the lowest rating is beyond belief."
1,junk,dont waste your time with this trash. after one day the lens fell out from just sitting on the counter. cheap junk
3,L'arte Di Gucci fragrance is wonderful however I found mine Cheaper at,"Absolutely the BEST rose I've ever smelled.....and I have smelled a lot in my life, however I did locate some Cheaper at thefragrancefactory.com"
4,Great gift,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas - they are very unique and we get a lot of compliments on them (I think mainly because we live in Idaho and no one has seen anything non-local team related). He has a set of Top Flite clubs, and these fit perfectly - not too tight and not so loose they can come off. However, the material they use for the head covers is some type of neoprene, and it gets dirty fast."
4,Great book!,This book is so cute with a mouse and gingerbread house. Great for reading at Christmas. I'm so happy with my purchase.
3,First grade teacher,I was disappointed because I thought it was another gingerbread man type story and it wasn't at all. It was a cute story just not what I expected.
2,Cute pictures/story lacking,"This book I thought was going to be great, the illustrations are way better than the story. It's kind of a lame story that sounds like it was written in 5 seconds."
5,The Peter Green collection,"Some of us sweated blood to get these tracks from different albums a long time ago. Now here they are collected: the amazing guitar work of Peter Green in all its glory with the bluesbreakers. The best thing that can be said about John Mayall is that he was a generous spirit and could recognize talent: he gave Peter the spotlight in many tracks, allowing him to record various guitar instrumentals and even sing on many tracks. Some of the best performances of Peter Green career are on this CD: Supernatural, the stumble, alabama blues, greeny... too many to mentioned. Essential listening for anybody who likes Peter Green, the blues, guitar...just great music."
5,Classic Mayall and Green- The Entire Collection At Last,"Classic English Blues! This remastered version sounds exceptionally good. What stands out is how well this recording has endured. The public now has access to all of the tracks that John and Peter cut together. For myself, I now have a cut of one of my favorites, ""Out of Reach."" And let's not forget another favorite of mine, ""Double Trouble."" No Mayall collection would be complete without ""A Hard Road."""
5,Blues and more blues,"This is a fantastic double CD. Great blues, great songs, great drums!!!! I will definitely be buying more of John Mayall."
4,Good stuff,There are a couple of mediocre tracks but over all a good recording. It's always good to hear Peter Green and it's no wonder that he split soon after to lead Fleetwood Mac.
4,Slight adj. nessesary & all is good,"The chair is very comfortable,quality of build appears good.The only real problem we found was the full upright position is just a little toooo laid back.Problem rectified by cutting one inch off the chrome ram rod & re-drilling the hole .This chair is now AWSOME!! "" caution"" modification not recomended for the ""less than handy"""
1,AWFUL,"THIS BOOK IS AWFUL!!!!!! I've never seen a textbook as terrible as this. Notice how the guy who gave it 5 stars is from MIT. I wouldnt be surprised if it Sodini himself. Nice try Charles, but your textbook is terrible."
1,"Confusing, unclear diagrams & equations, disinteresting",Howe used this book when I was in his class. The book only furthered my confusions. Equations were not clear and generalities did not exist. Device physics area could use more general statements concerning equations and their use. Overall......total confusion.
4,A decent introduction,"It is a decent introduction to the basics of semiconductor devices, as well as analog and digital circuit design. But it is just that, only an introduction. More advanced books may be required for full understanding."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This is the worst textbook that I have ever read. The authors make way too many assumptions in deriving their equations. Also, their approximations seem very sketchy and go without proper justification. All of these assumptions and approximations make it near impossible to understand anything, and so the student is just left with a bunch of meaningless equations. The end-of-chapter problems and excercises thus become just plug-and-chug, and they teach the student absolutely nothing about semiconductor devices. The problems are only difficult in that the student must search through the 150 or so gigantic equations in each chapter to find the correct one to plug the numbers into. No insight is gained."
5,5 Stars! Greatest Hits From One of the Best Rappers EVER!!!,"K-Rino is criminally underrated. This man should be on everyone's top 10 DOA list period, but is slept on because he is an OG from the south who comes with that real KNOWLEDGE.This CD is a greatest hits collection of his songs between 1993-2003 and is classic in every sense of the word. Not one weak song. This is even worth it for fans who have all the CDs as he included 3 NEW BONUS tracks - which are dope dope dope. ""The One"" is especially dope and he has a video for it on Youtube you can look up.This man is dope and if you are new or unfamiliar with him you need to get familiar. This is a good place to start, but ALL of his CDs bang hard and are lyrically amazing."
3,"Nice, but too theoretical","Provides a very thorough framework for understanding and theorizing about family owned / managed businesses. When the rubber meets the road, the book does not provide enough practical advice to be useful outside of business school."
2,What a shame!,"This review is for the quality, NOT the shows. I grew up with, and loved, the Beverly Hillbillies. I have a few VHS tapes, but wanted better quality as you would expect with DVD. NOT!The shows on VHS are even better than this mini frisbie.Not only is the quality poor, but the theme song is gone.No ""Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed...""There's this banjo music I never heard before.All I can think is that someone wanted to make a quick buck.A truely pathetic example of modern technology. Save your money.Maybe some day Jed and his clan will get a respectable release."
2,The Beverly Hillbilies-do not reccomend this set!,"I was VERY dissapointed with this set. The episodes are the edited versions that are shown in sydnication, and they don't even have the Jerry Scroggins (the late singer who did the opening and closing themes) instead they have some deep voiced guy who sounds like he's trying to do an Elvis impression and isn't very good at it. They also don't have the original theme music by Flatt & Scruggs, and the video quality is only so-so, as is the sound.Also, the episodes aren't shown in order. They only show 2 episodes of the ""arcs"" of when Elly is dating Sonny Drysdale, and when Leaf Crick visits.They have some extras, but all they are is a short biography of each cast member, and pictures from some episodes.The menu does, however, have a ""play all"" feature, which is good.People who are fans of the sereies who have never seen the first episode (""The Clammpetts strike oil"")would enjoy seeing that, however, (even though it's, unfortunately, edited)."
3,Where`s Flatt and Scruggs,"It`s like meeting old friends again.When this show first ran here in the U.K it was the highlight of my weeks viewing. To show how much Jed and his family are remembered when I mentioned to a friend I had ordered this set his first words were ""Weeeellll Doggy"". Now the down side. The quality is`nt what you would normally expect from D V D but I suppose to re-master all these episodes would be quite expensive. The biggest mistake is where`s the theme gone. When they all appear at the end of each episode in the doorway you expect to hear. ""Come and listen to my story `bout a man named Jed"". This was one of the most famous themes on T.V. Its like watching Rawhide without Frankie Laine."
4,"An Excellent DVD, with some flaws","20 episodes of the greatest show of all time, what more could you ask for? Well, the theme song would be nice, but it's not a huge deal. Who evere chose these episodes clearly knew what they were doing, ""The Gient Jackrabbit"" Could very well be the funniest thing I've ever seen. I have never gotten the ""Buddy Ebsen Bio"" to work, but that could very well be my DVD player."
4,Great LCD for price & size,"I purchased this for a bedroom and have it on a wall bracket. It was easy to install, has good sound for it's size and the picture is great.Only comment is on some older TV shows the backgrounds can be a bit too dark. I've tried playing with the setting but it doesn't help much. I would recommend this Samsung. It's a good TV at a great price."
5,must buy!!!!!!!!!!!!,i just got this and i just got to say wow the imputs it has a gamemode for video games the picture is great and the sound is AMAZING buy this
3,Sensational,"Wanted a wide screen TV, but don't have much room. This is made to order. Fantastic picture, great sound. Able to tweak to perfection with simple to do adjustments. All you have to do is turn it on!"
5,As Good Or Better Than The Yitzhak Rabin Album,"Instrumentation is superb. Vocals by Alpha Blondy is crisp and clear. Any weakness? Yes. For me, track 1 sounded a little offbeat, perhaps, because it is very hard to do better than the Ojays original version.This is a very solid CD. Guitars, horns, and drums (oh the drums!) come alive on this CD. The impeccable arrangement and masterful delivery of many tracks, especially 3, 5, and 6 shows Alpha Blondy is the real Reggae master from Africa.It is hard to listen to this CD sitting down. I dare you to listen to track 3 sitting down. Relax your grip, and let go of your money this time. Buy this CD. You will have no regrets!"
3,I can't help but sense a little bias.,"My midsouth cohorts now seem a bit too easily pleased. Havingconvinced me to rush out and snag this alleged gem ... I was expecting quite a bit more. Don't get me wrong--this is a nice album, and I like instrumental rock, but even with LP limitations of '83 they could have thrown in another song (this is 39 min.). I'd never heard of jangle pop, and I'll say I'm now mildly enthusiastic about it. These are tight instranthems that eclipse dittiness, but they do little more. Most lack any real punch or soul, sounding certainly well-rehearsed but thereby limiting emotional response. I was expecting a more prominent banjo and also for not quite so many almost exclusively guitar-driven cuts. One gets the feeling they are being too tidy, holding something back; it would be interesting to hear them ""let it all hang out."" Basically, I think I would have enjoyed this album more if it had been recorded while the musicians were drunk. Perhaps even live would be preferable."
5,Worth Every Penny,"Although this appears to be a small venued event, there is no denying the talent, energy and drive of Rizen!View the Holy City makes the DVD worthwile even if it was the only song played. I have had the CD and while both are exhilirating, it has that extra oomph when you see these ladies in joyous action."
4,Stern is one funny Jew!,"Not nearly as hilarious as Private Parts but I still got some laughs out of this. I tend to read a lot of very serious morose stuff but I like to read a book that makes me laugh now and then. Sterns humor is very neurotic and self loathing, at times very juvenile, and very Jewish (obsession with bodily functions, sexual insecurities, childhood traumas and persecution complexs) but I have always thought he was funny. Stern is one funny Jew!"
5,Also the funniest damn book I've read!,"Howard proves himself again in this book. He shows even more of himself, literally! This book, like Private Parts, show his soft side, his loyalty, and his ability to beat the odds and succeed anywhere and everywhere! Howard Stern Rules!"
3,"Good read, but author' style leaves a bit to be desired",Howard should have consulted more with a real writer on this one- jumps around a bit like his previous works. It's a light read so take it for what it is.
4,H_S_M_A,the funny stuff will make a good movie but there are some boring sick anecdotes... pure stern for the fan!
1,Great radio doesn't translate to the printed page,"I really enjoy Howard's radio show and bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon. Similar to the comments listeners make about the radio show, I kept reading to see what would come next. I was really disappointed. Things that may be funny on the radio just seem trite when written. The account of the destruction of DeBella, Philadelphia's ex-top DJ, showed sadism through the airways at its worst. Not just content to be #1, Howard had to destroy people's lives.Stick with the radio/tv but leave this art form alone."
2,"Derwood, This Isn't A Novel...","To the guy who keeps calling this book a novel: This is non-fiction. ""Gone With the Wind"" is a novel...As for the book itself, it's aimed at Stern's (mostly) semi-illiterate audience, and on that level it succeeds brilliantly. It's more like ""Mad Magazine For Dummies"". I have nothing against Stern and like his show. He's incredibly slick at coming up with the kind of lowest-common-denominator material that his crowd craves."
1,The FCC should Ban this book,"It's next to the worse book I've read yet, ""Private Parts,"" is the worse. My gosh, you'd think with all his money he could write something worth reading except about his ham life; this guy has got to figure out what a plot and theme is, there is none. And just run on sentences going nowhere. He must sell them to his followers, becasue there is nothing of interest in it just talking and talking and talking of the FCC, and how he did this and that, where ever he ends up, he does. It was not a disappointment in that, I figured it would be something along that order, especially after I read the dirty mouth garbage and seen the pictures in ""Private Parts."""
2,Cashing in,It seemed to me that Stern was cashing in on his previous book's success. This one seemed rushed and less poignant. Not nearly as good as Private Parts. I expected more substance.
3,"Decent Read, Not as Good as 'Private Parts'","I am a HUGE Howard Stern fan & have been since 1993. I've read his first tome, ""Private Parts"" a handful of times through the years & enjoy it every single time. Now this book on the other hand is nothing like ""PP"". Even recently HS has said that he wishes he could rewrite it. I bought this book thinking that the 1st time I tried to read it was so long ago that maybe I didn't give it a chance. Well, I've read it again now, & the only thing I can say is that it was a tad better the 2nd time around. There is more insight into the on-air players & other staff that is interesting. Overall though, it feels like an empty read for a true fan. Just a follow up to the 1st book to make some $$. Stick with ""Private Parts"" for a funnier, more interesting read. This book is okay to keep in your bathroom & skip around reading certain parts here & there; a lot can be skipped. And Howard even agrees! :)"
5,A Must-Read For Any Stern Fan!!!,I couldn't stop laughing at this sick but funny book. It really shows what Howard's all about. I'm reading it for the third time already!
2,Waterloo Sunset - US edition review (revised),"What bothers me is that the US is a reworked bookIts not really the same book as the original UK book, and it doesn't really work as a resultStick to the original publishing, which worked very well I thought. I don't know why he rewrote bits and changed the structure of the book!"
2,Ray's storytelling is best suited to his songwriting.,"I am a huge Kinks and Ray Davies fan. It is clear that Ray is playing up his new ""Storyteller"" image that he created with the first installment of the VH-1 series and his solo CD. But his storytelling is best suited to his songwriting and one-man show. The stories in this book are disjointed and make no sense. Ray may be trying too hard to be some kind of existentialist poet and pays too little attention to plot. For the benefit of Kinks fans, he throws in the lyrics to Kinks songs that have little to do with the stories except for their titles. The stories are a lot like his film ""Return to Waterloo"", which had little plot but benefitted from the great music. The music, of course, is missing from this book, unless you plan on playing each song mentioned as you read it."
4,Star Gossip,"Everyone loves to go to the supermarket checkout lines and read the Enquirer. This book is nothing more than a bigger version of the Enquirer. The author tells interesting gossip about specially chosen famous people. I think he mainly chose people that were homosexual or had homosexual tendencies. It is amazing how many ""stars"" have homosexual leanings or who can't keep their pants on. If you like to read those rag mags, then you will enjoy this free for all."
3,AVP2:PH,AVP 2 the best pc title gets a make over but not a good make over this is more of a demo the storys are 3 levels but if you like online play you will enjoy this but if you like the story it is not worth a single penny.
3,"What do you do when AVP2 is a horror masterpeice, not this","I am a huge fan of the alien and predator movies, despite my age. When I played AVP2, I knew I was hooked. But this is a atrocity!!! partly because the same team that made the original was finishing NOLF2 when the expansion was proposed. What made the original great (horror after horror after horror filled with atmosphere), was traded for action. All you ever do is fight waves and waves of aliens the entire time. Its a shame as it could have been great...... of course on planetavp (a website) they say monolith is toying with the idea of making a second expansion. hmmmmmm"
4,AvP2 primal hunt,"I am a major fan of AvP2, it is a amazingly good game, i agree compltly with these other people going on about the game having no real plot, the motion tracker blimbing, the dark corridors, the screams! the hive, the only good thing about this game i found was that there was sentrys aviable on ""some"" maps I am really angry that they did not put them in ally, or qurantinealso i good thing to make this game a sucsuss is that there ned to be better maps bigger ones with bases and stuff like that, so hunmans can use there vicles, MP is fun but its just a big blood bath, people want CooP ness or atleast a battlefield forstperson stratgy like reneagdebut this is an amzing game dont let that through you off, the preds claoking has been made more easy to see gives newbes a better chance but hey they still die lolfrom{SAS}Pathfinder{S}"
1,Great Game - Way too Short Single Player Missions,"Although the game this is based on is an excellent game, this expansion is going to disappoint a lot of people. The gameplay, what there is of it, is very good, but the single player games are extremely short. There are 3 single player modes, Corporate (Marine), Predator and Predalien. The human single player episode took me about 3 hours to solve. The Predator version took about 2.5 hours. The Predalien version took 4 hours, mostly because some of the room exits were very subtly placed and difficult to find. So for me, this expansion was around 9.5 hours total game time. For single player missions, this is extremely short! The original AvP2 single player games took over 16 hours each, to complete.Don't waste your money until they add significantly more content..."
5,So perfect,"This little gift was perfect. I got it for my uber musical boyfriend for Christmas, because he is always losing his drum keys in his studio. He loved it - said it was very well made and sturdy, not any cheapie. The clasp works like a guitar strap. It also arrived a few days earlier than expected which was nice because I got to give it to him for Christmas. Great seller, great product :)"
2,Calculus textbook,"The seller sent the product to me as fast as I asked him to, but it was the wrong edition of the textbook."
3,Quick service,This was needed for my sun's class and he received it very quickly. The condition of the book was excellent.
3,It does the job...,"But not much more than that. In other words, it's good enough, but it could be better. It would be really nice if it would give more applications of how calculus is useful. It does give a fair number of physics applications, mainly in mechanics, but most students are not into mechanics (I for one am a neuroscience and electrical engineering major). Also, it explains things in a sometimes more difficult way than necessary. The solutions guide that you can also buy often skips a number of steps when working out a problem. Finally, the book is very expensive for being about a subject that hasn't changed in ages."
3,nothing special,"It is hard to understand... by understand I meant you understand what really going on when you calculate something. I am not talking about memorize any method to solve a math problem but understand the math and apply it. The book explains you the method ""1"" but expects you to know ""2"" to solve the problems. Try another Calculus book instead."
2,"OK Textbook, I Guess","We used this book in the Calculus I class I just finished. My teacher was great, so I have an A or A- in the class (grades aren't in yet), but it was no thanks at all to this textbook. Whenever I got stuck on a problem, I would try to go back to the chapter for some guidence, but, well, there isn't any. I am very good at math, and I had a hard time following what they were doing in the examples. There were more than a couple of problem formats at the end of the chapter that weren't really explained at all in the text. I guess if your teacher only uses the book for the end of chapter exercises, it is good, but we still had to go over a lot of them in class because, like I said, the book didn't explain how to do some of them and we were all lost."
2,Reference Book - Not For Learning,"This text is written for mathematicians, by mathematicians. It works well as a refresher for those who already know the material and need to brush up. The descriptions are written with absolutely no outside perspective. Analogies are not used.The solutions manual often skips multiple steps, such as how a partial fraction was obtained, or a special limit property used in the process of finding a solution.Do not attempt to learn Calculus from this book. It will only discourage new students from learning higher levels of mathematics."
3,Not an easy read,"One plus is that the sections are short and there are lots of examples. However, the explanations are not simplified enough. Average text. The online CD helps provide support for what the text lacks."
1,Worst Math book I've ever owned.,"This math book cannot stand on it's own to convey the knowledge of Calculus. Although there are not many errors, there are errors, which is inexcusable for an 8th try (edition). It's not as if Calculus changes. However, that's not my primary complaint. The problem with the book is that it does a poor job of teaching. It takes some of the simplest ideas, and seems to make an effort to complicate them - as if they're trying to make Calculus harder than it is. Also, it sometimes takes space to explain easy topics while glossing over more difficult ones. I have found Calculus relatively easy to understand, but no thanks to this book. I can't imagine how people who don't find math easy must feel trying to trudge through this book."
4,Solid Book,"This book is pretty solid. I am learing Calculus for the first time and have been very pleased with the format and descriptions. I like that there are bios of people who have contributed to the foundation of Calculus as well. Examples are strong as well. My only gripe would be that some of the examples skip steps, but it's mostly algebra related so I would reccomend a either a strong algebra backround, or also have a source to go to when you need assistance with algebra."
5,Excellent,Sent extremely fast and the book is in excellent condition. It also Included everything that was advertised.Thanks for everything!!! Great seller
2,No CD Included,"Even though the book was listed under New Books, the book exhibited some wear and the CD was not included. If I had known the CD was not included, I could have just bought a used book in very good condition and had the same item for much less money. In the future, if a ""new book"" is missing the CD then that should be stated in the description."
1,...wrong book,"This is actually Calculus the 9th edition. I got it in the mail and the ISBN was correct with what I had ordered, but it was actually the 9th edition- not the 8th. The 8th edition's ISBN is 0618503005. Even though in the picture it looks like it is the 8th edition, it is the 9th!! So, make sure to check its really the book you need before you order. I was thoroughly disappointed with this order. I might have been wrong for not checking the ISBN, but amazon was partially at fault. They shouldn't have put up the wrong picture."
3,Calculus (w/ analytic Geometry) 8th edition,"The three calculus classes should have seperate books, for those who are not going to take calc 3. It's alot of money to shell out for one class."
5,Vet Variety,Good cross section of the country selection of recipes from the unusual to the usual with a new twist for those who want to add variety to their cooking.Thank you to Ray & Terri for their hard work in compiling these favorites.Looking forward to the second AVC!~Ann in Upstate South Carolina~
3,Looked different on Amazon,"It will work as a basic backup wallet. Online appeared to have more compartments and the ones it did have were too small for even a business card, let alone my drivers license. Ended up buying a more affective wallet from Victorinox (Swiss Army)."
4,Got me my MOS Master!,"1 Play and learn all the functions of the 2003 applications.2 Use MeasureUp practice tests; you can play with all the functions in 2003 using the online version of the MeasureUp practice test if you don't have a copy of the all the 2003 applications.3 Use the Certiport practice tests, the 2002 versions are just as helpful and seem to be free, so much overlaps.4 Use this book; I never much used the printed copy, I used the Adobe pdf version that came along with it along with the practice files."
4,Used this for work,I had to reapir some databases and make up another tracking tool this book provided the information that I need back in 2009 when I was setting up some programs
5,2003 Inside Out,This book is what I have been looking for in terms of depth of coverage and ease of use. It is supported by a CD with excellent examples and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to gain a thorough grounding in Access.
2,"Lots of Information, but not enough explaning","I find that Mr. Viescas is too specific in his examples, and does not explain how everything works.I found that the first half of the book was great and helpful in covering the basics about microsoft access.However when you get to the section on VBA and automating your applications, He will give you specific example, tell you how he wrote the code, but will not give you clear enough examples about how to do it on your own, in your own application. Very Frustrating.Mr. Viescas is not alone though. I have been reading many Access Books, and Access VBA Books, and have yet to find one that really teaches you how to do it."
2,Not Worth It's Weight,"For being nearly 1300 pages, this book is barely sufficient. While there is plenty of information, the book is poorly organized with sparse and general headings followed by paragraphs of wordy explanatory text. A better use of headings and sub headings would allow for better reference.Turning for help in the index is also disappointing. The book is poorly indexed and seems to have been given little thought or personal attention to its organization.The last place to turn is to code samples, but these are so sparse and abbreviated that you have to search for them among pages of text. I'm all for having copies of the code on the accompanying CD, but for even a neophyte, sample code is essential to grasping all the detail.I feel sympathetic that the author obviously spent a prodigious amount of time writing 1300 pages of prose, but the bottom line for technology books is that you need to show me, not just tell me about it."
3,Access for Office 07,Typical Inside Out book. More useful than the others as I felt Access changed the most out of the Office suite.
3,"Would be 5 stars for content, but gets 3 because of writing and organization","I think this is a very useful book, if you can figure out how to use it. A lot of comments have been made, both positive and negative. I agree with most of them. This book is both indispensible and very confusing at times.I want to mention that my copy had some printing problems. A few of the pages are almost blank because they were printed so lightly, or are just streaks of ink. For example, pages 43, 46, 51, and 54 are all like this. There are more than that, but I don't want to list every single one. This appears only to be a problem in the introductory section, which is mostly stuff I didn't bother reading anyway (and if you're not brand new to Access you don't need it either)."
2,No practical answers!,"Almost all instructions in the book are based on the example database supplied with the CD. It's almost impossible to read the book without referencing to the example database. It is badly written, too generic and it offers no answers to practical questions. It's a book for beginners, but the title pretends otherwise. Here is just a random sentence from the book that illustrates how bad it is (and there are MANY of these)... Page 289; ""As discussed earlier in this chapter, you know that to solve certain types of problems you must first build one query to define a subset of data from your tables and then use that query as input to another query to get the final answer"". Come ON!"
2,What a lousy book!,"I don't know why I am the first reader to rate this book. Although I learned something from this book, I regard it very low (lower than any Access books I have read). The author is obviously not qualified to write such book. He simply does not know how to start and explain the technical stuff. You need to take pain in learning something very simple. To be fair, I have to mention its merit: It seems to have contained more reference information."
3,Something to talk about,"This book is okay. I haven't found a dialogue book that is better.I would like this book better if the dialogues were more generic, more what many students might experience day-by-day rather than specific to a particular event which a student might or might not encounter. Still, it gives the students a script with which they can begin to speak.The CD that comes with the book doesn't seem tied to the index. You just have to punch through the CD chapters, hoping you will find the right one. This is very frustrating!I use this with three teenage refugee students from Burma and Kenya who work with an aide while I teach high school English to 40 other students (in Utah)."
4,Family fun at a good value,Good quality. I was glad I spent a little more to avoid some of the problems that were written about in reviews of some of the cheaper bingo games. We had fun playing across 3 generations-- kids aged 10 and 13. I think even much younger kids would enjoy.
3,Fun game with a few hassles,"I wanted to buy my grandchildren (3 and 6) a bingo game that had an actual cage; I knew they would enjoy rolling the balls and calling out the numbers. After some research, I decided on this one. They do enjoy it and so do their friends and our family, but there were a few disappointments. The cage door where the balls are inserted fell open when the cage was turned, spewing balls all over the table. We fixed that by keeping the door closed with a twist-tie. The numbers on the balls started to wear off almost immediately, and I spent a lot of time writing in numbers with a sharpie. Despite the problems, the kids love it and I've seen their number recognition skills grow as we play the game."
5,Bingo Game,I am very pleased with this game. I have 2 young grandsons and they love playing it. They don't realize how much they are learning. It is an awesome way to make learning fun. It is very good quality. The boys loves to spend the cage! Kay
4,BINGO is classic,I purchased this as a gift for my sister-in-law's family (at her request). They thought it would be a great family activity since they have a 6 year old and 4 year old. They were right and said they have played twice since Christmas and love it. My only complaint is I thought the pieces were a little small.
5,Great Bingo Set!,I purchased this Bingo Set for my nephew's 11th birthday party. He wanted to have a Bingo themed party after attending a recent Bingo Night at his school. This set was awesome. Well constructed and smooth dispensing. The color coded balls were a definite plus. Now we have the game for continued family fun.
4,FUN FOR ALL,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN-AGES 6,8,9IT KEPT THEM INTERESTED FOR HOURS, ESPECIALLYWHEN PRIZES WERE AWARDED. IT'S A GREAT PARTY GAME.THE KIDS LOVE TO SPIN THE WHEEL AND CALL THE NUMBERS"
3,"High on text, 0 on illustrations.","This book was very informative textually but did not have any illustrations to actually show the motions of sign language.The other book that I purchased, Indian Sign Language by Tomkins, was much better insofar as illustrations and as a bonus for me had a very nice section on pictographs and ideographs which is what I am most interested in."
3,Short but sweet,"This is a strange, but interesting, film.If you have played an MMORPG, or games like Diablo, then you'll understand the world in which this film is set. Three gorgeous women and one not-gorgeous man are forced to work together.I bought this because of the director - Ghost in the Shell is a landmark in anime. I was curious what a live-action film would be like. I have to say that it's nowhere near that standard. It is worth seeing, but it feels like a short film, rather than a full feature."
2,Well done bad movie,"I had such high hopes for this movie and was let down. The production quality is top notch. Unfortunately, the agonizingly slow pace and utterly boring story make this film an absolute waste of time. Basically, it is a story about four people playing a really stupid video game."
1,Confusa.,"Con un prologo de 7 minutos y una caminata del primer actor en 5 minutos, son los 12 minutos mas amplios de duración de alguna película que haya visto. Solo vi la mitad. Sin guión, salvo algunos detalles de animación, no mas."
1,Run far away,"I cannot rate this movie low enough. I know the trailer and the cover look cool, but it's a total lie. What I tell you now is not an exaggeration or a fabrication of any sort, it is 100% true. This movie is a 15 minute short film that has been padded in length to a feature film with shots of environments, clouds, posing actors, and french art house crap. I swear to God this is true, there is 15 minutes of actual movie, with 1.15 hours of screen saver."
1,Just don't.,"I'm a Mamoru Oshii fan..I really am. But I made a mistake by renting this movie--this movie lacked a story. I was so disappointed, I just had to look up other reviews on it because I took a chance & rented it since I saw the AWESOME cover and since it was directed by Mamoru Oshii. For those of you who want to check it out for yourselves, good luck. There was no storyline, the ACTOR/actresses were just mumbling--like they just quickly remember their lines real quick & it was just confusing. Still to this day I sit as I'm typing and ask myself ""What the hell did I just watch??"" So, yeah...I don't recommend this anyone."
2,It was like World Of Warcraft,"Seriously. During the boss fight one of the toons was just dancing. If ever there was a time for shouting MINUS FIFTY DKP that was it. Really it would be SWKP for Sand-Whale Kill Points.This movie is weak on all points except silly costumes. It has great silly costumes.And it really is about the absurdity that you find inside an MMORPG. The one girl just spends her time dancing. There is ninja-looting, hardcore soloing, PvP, and sand whales.I feels like this movie was filmed in English, but it also feels like only one of the four speaking characters can actually speak English. The talking can be quite painful.I originally described this movie as an empathetic DO NOT WATCH. But I've softened my stance since then. If you like MMORGs, and can view this movie for cheap, go ahead. Just don't expect much."
2,"The only thing good thing about this movie is that its pretty (girls, graphics).","I first saw this at New York Comic Con 2010. What was advertised in the program book about this movie was totally misleading (for shame!). While I can give a run down about the plot, or the lack of, but just about every other reviewer has done so and I just don't want to... relive the movie. Again. So what if this movie is slow (fast forward!), makes you wonder where this is all leading to (get to the point already!) and the rare amounts of dialogue, well the less said about the script the better... but it does feature hot girls, awesome action in the few exciting parts it does have and the ending is pretty epic. Epic in the I-can't-believe-I-wasted-my-time-to-see-it-end-like-this, epic. So yeah, I give it a two for the graphics, girls and nothing much else."
3,weird U.S.,"Good education on the some history aspects. Actually i bought this for my husband and ask him would he recommend it he said ""i guess"". So i guess it is a so so movie."
5,Excellent step-by-step training manual for the Search and Rescue Dog,There's no other book like this one that breaks down the elements of training an urban search-and-rescue dog. I already had it in paperback but wanted it for my kindle.
5,Vacuum Bag,Couldn't believe the cost of these and they are the right sizes for my vacuum cleaner. A great buy compared to the cost you pay for regular Bosch vacuum bags.
3,works fine,The bag is a little larger than it should be for my model but it seems to work okay. Good value would be its strongest point.
2,not a very good fit,"I tried these vacuum cleaner bags for my Bosch canister vacuum because they were so much cheaper than the real deal and thus worth a try. However, after I put one in, it became very difficult to close the lid. When it finally clicked and I turned the vacuum on, it made a high pitched noise. I don't think these bags will extend my vacuum's life time to say the least. I'm going back to using the real Bosch type G vacuum bags."
1,Talking head,This was just a talking head DVD. No production value. Didn't learn much. The guy was just reading a script.
4,It helped me laugh about my upcoming reunion,"10 years ago I spotted this book while approaching my twentieth reunion. I fell in love with the title essay and am now ordering it for a friend as we approach yet another reunion. This is not a how to book. It is a collection of musings on life, and a very enjoyable one."
5,An excellent C.D. You will not be disappointed.,"--I purchased this C.D. a few months ago, and I love it. Tracks 5 (Russian Radio, remixed by Scribe Machine) and 14 (If I Ever, remixed by B.C.) really stand out. There is a lot of talent on this disc. All of the remixes were excellent. Long live Synthpop!"
5,Great collection of remixes plus a rarity and a new song,"This is a great collection of remixes done by other bands and hand-picked by Red Flag.There are a couple of ""bonuses"" on this album - one of the songs is a rare b-side from their first single (the remix is actually better in my opinion than the original) and another is a song that will appear on a yet to be released album with different words."
3,Red Flag - Who are the Skulls?,"I'm not a fan of remix CDs, for the most part, they are utterly useless, either creating a version of a song vastly inferior to the original, or just adding nothing to it, doing nothing interesting in the least. That being said, I like this CD, not a whole lot, there are a few of those inferior songs lurking about, but on the flipside there are some incredibly good tracks! The very first track for example, remixed by the late, great Cosmicity is truly an accomplishment. So there are some pointless remixes on here, but there truly are some gems as well. Recommended for those particular tracks alone."
5,Rough Lumber,"When I read this book, the tales of my own grandmother stirred in my mind. Justine's humor and joy of life should serve as a standard to a new generation as she proves that determination, love and mischief taken in good measure will put you on a path of joy and fulfillment throughout your life. Close your eyes and you can smell the spring afternoon at the brook, or hog-killing day. Maybe you'll hear the whispers in class, or the dying breath of one of the patients she cared for until the end of their days. This book is rich in imagery and will take you to a time only a few will still remember with such clarity and fondness. At last, an accurate picture of rural life in the West Virginia hills."
5,Rough Lumber Stories from Spurlock Creek,"The author gives vivid detail of her life in rural West Virginia during the depression and afterwards. For anyone with a desire to know how life was in poor Appalachia, this an excellent book to get factual details. I know that she gives an accurate detail about the life because I also grew up in the same area."
3,fun to remember,"Although the author is ten years my senior, and grew up in a different mountain region than I did, I still was able to relate to much of what she mentions. Of course, there's much I would be happy to forget. All in all, the book is good, although I did begin to second guess the author's memory when she mentions pretending to be Patsy Cline while playing her guitar in the outhouse as a young girl. Seeing that Cline didn't become known until the mid to late 1950's, the author would have been thirty years old. Not trying to nitpick, but that just stuck in my mind."
2,Airy and weak pop music,"Raman's ""Love Trap"" intrigued me, for its promise of intercultural sound weavings. But when it arrived, I discovered its mediocrity. It's just cheap music, reminiscent of the worst of 1970s pop music: light, weak, and empty. Right from the first track, ""Love Trap,"" you know you're in for a frivilous album, with trite background vocals ""Love Trap, Love Trap, oooh, Love Trap, Love Trap, ooooh,"" and tin-plated lyrics."
4,long live anarchy,"these sunglasses rock. the only thing bad about them is that they are a bit tight on the sides, other then that they are one of the best pairs tha ti have ever owned. the no slip nose guard rocks"
2,Couldn't get through it,"Maybe if I hadn't read ""Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea"" perhaps I could have forced myself through this book. I had every expectation that the telling of the story of the Brother Jonathan would be of the same caliber, but in the end, my mind rebelled at the multiple diversions into minutae that bogged the story down below my acceptable threshold for tedium."
3,Good but no 'Ship of Gold',"I enjoyed this book but having already 'Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea'by Gary Kinder I couldn't help but compare the two and I rate 'Ship of Gold' far more highly, it was (in my opinion)a more interesting story and far better written. I found the description of the Brother Johnathan's final voyage a bit long and tedious. There were too many passenger descriptions of, for example, how big the waves were or how strong the wind was. I felt it wasn't necessary as i could well imagine the sea state and couldn't help thinking 'hurry up and sink already' so i could read about the discovery and recovery. If i had read this before reading 'Ship of Gold' i may have enjoyed it more but it was still a good read."
2,Plodding,"As both a wreck diver and an historian, I'm usually a sucker for books like these - it's really hard to make a book about sunken treasure boring but Dennis Powers has a good go at it.I know there are several very positive customer reviews but it's interesting to look at the Publishers Reviews above; they're nearly all from people who were part of the recovery team so just shows how hard they were having to look to find positive comments.The first quarter of the book which deals with the shipwreck is interesting and well written but the rest of it...way more than you'll ever want to know about lawyers, California's state regulations, auction procedures, coin controversies etc.Part of the problem for the author may be that it's not really a very exciting story in some aspects; the ship sunk, nobody could find it, then they did, recovered a bit of gold....that's it. It's not a 400 page book, if they'd cut 50 pages maybe it would have been better."
3,Dale Watson Live - Honky Tonk From One Of The Best,"Dale Watson fans waiting for new material should be fairly pleased with this release - the the majority of the album is new work, some self penned & some classic covers, along with previously recorded songs included here and there. .Highlights from the new material, for me are: ""Can't Be Satisfied"", ""Ain't That Livin'"", ""In The Jailhouse"", ""Mama's Hungry Eyes"", ""Bright Lights"", ""Heart Of Stone"", ""Turn Off The Jukebox"", ""Break Your Own Heart"" & ""No Fussin', No Cussin'"".The only real clunker is ""Country My Ass"" - Dale IS preachin' to the choir here, but the sermon is getting a bit long - he's already made his point about the sad state of today's mainstream country on his earlier songs, ""Real Country Song"" & ""Nashville Rash"". He should have left it at that and saved the bitchin' for the liner notes.This album isn't nearly as good as his first four - but that said, ""Dale Watson Live in London"" is still well worth a listen."
1,This was a waste,"I rate this Minus 1 star. This battery DOES NOT FIT the CREATIVE NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra!! Buyers Beware. This battery is slightly smaller than the original battery, and it slides around inside the NOMAD case, and makes NOMAD turn itself off!!The only way I could get it to work at all was to pad the extra space around this battery with thin cardboard.Next time I need one, I will buy the original product instead of trying to save a few $$ buying a cheap knock-off."
3,Not perfect but it works.,"I ordered two of these batteries for my old Zen Xtra. As others have said, this battery is a fraction smaller than the original one and it will require a simple shim of some sort. One could use a toothpick, a piece of plastic, or some strips of electrical tape attached to the end of the battery. It's not really a big deal and otherwise these batteries work fine. Considering that these Zen players are dinasaurs age-wise we're lucky to be able to find batteries at such a low price. Actually my biggest complaint is the shipping costs from this company. There is a fixed shipping rate per item which turned out to be a ridiculous amount for the two small batteries I ordered. So the advertised price of this company's products is a bit of a farce but overall I was still happy to get the batteries."
2,Not quite the right fit,"I have a 40G Zen Xtra and purchased this battery to replace my tired old battery. The replacement doesn't fit snuggly -- it is smaller in size than the original battery. The battery required a shim be made for it -- without it, the battery couldn't make contact so it couldn't be charged and used.The battery seems to work ok (I've only had it for a few days) but it is not a perfect replacement for my MP3 player."
1,Horrible battery life,"I got this battery because the stock one for my 40GB Creative Jukebox Zen Xtra didn't want to charge any more. I don't usually write reviews for products, but I was inclined to let everyone else know that while this battery does work with my MP3 player, the life of it is horrendous. It only last 1-2 hours after being fully charged.It's the only option I have now since it's a replacement for my other battery that doesn't work, but just know that it is not a very good backup if that is what you are buying it for."
1,What Happened?,"BOOOOOOOO! What the hell happened to In Flames? This cd doesn't even qualify as an In Flames cd in my opinion. I love all of thier cds, even Reroute to Remain. Soundtrack is missing all of the awesome aspects that they had on Reroute: Heavy breakdowns, soft melodies, vocal harmonizing, and most importantly SOLOS! Where are the SOLOS? I'm am thoroughly dissapointed in this cd. It seems In Flames made this record just to please everyone else besides thier fans. This album sucks compared to all of thier previous albums. This album bores me, musically."
4,A Lot Better,"While In Flames will probably never be able to mirror their greatness established with such name brand albums like Whoreacle and The Jester Race, this album is a sincere improvement from Reroute to Remain.Come now, we all saw this coming...eventually a gothenburg band had to play prettyboy, and In Flames was it. However, they are now proving perhaps that the diecast experiementation found in RTR was just a one album trial run. It was good for sales, but in turn, they also receieved a lot of hatred from longtime metalheads.I admit, had i reviewed this disc after hearing just the song ""The Quiet Place"" i would say that In Flames had evolved about as much as a rock. However, that is the lone song that reminds me to a grand degree of RTR. The rest of the album shines as new and edgy.Come on now, In Flames isnt going to make a new Whoreacle. You need to embrace the new however. This album isn't that bad now."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"Dissapointing.....very very disappointing... From what was once a magnificent melodic metal band has now joined the force of nu-metal. What is this world of music coming to? This cd is complete trash compared to early works such as colony, jester race, amd lunar strain. I mean it's complete trash anyway.REAL metal fans stay far... far away from this cd. right hand man lives."
1,What on EARTH??,"I'm going to be honest here, I NEVER liked in flames, ever... but i allways respected them for creating inovative, qualitatively good music. Behind Space (99 whatever) is even one of the songs that i learned how to plan on my guitar. just out of respect though, cause their music just isnt really 'my thing', but i listen to their stuff sometimes anyway (not too long, gives me a headache)But now for this album... what the hell are these guys thinking?? this is NU-metal! now i have even lost my respect for this band! the guitars are plain stupid, the vocals are just waaay too Korny, and the entire innovative aspect of their band just dissappeard unto thin air.My GOODNESS in flames, how low can you go?0/1000"
1,"hm, u diss michael jackson bloodshy u get kicked back","its sad to know that someone like bloodshy disrepsects GOOD MUSIC like michael jackson but likes the new music that gets all of the little kids rushing to the store to get. explicit lyrics, oh that makes you cool.it shows the kind of music and mind u have. u may think, oh i hate michael jackson because i beleive the media, that shows the size of a brain you have. that proves that with your small brain, this must the worst album ever. hahahahaha. it just comes back to you."
2,Why?,"I am a huge In Flames fan. That being said, this sucks. Why are they trying to sound like Korn. Reroute to Remain blows as well for that matter. I guess I will just listen to their older stuff and imagine what could have been."
2,Very Disappointed,"I love In Flames. They are one of my favorite bands. I discovered In Flames when the heavy music scene looked as though it could sink no further, and it was a shocking and blissful experience when I first heard the band. I dutifully purchased their entire catalog and discovered the brilliant Whoracle, The Jester Race, Colony, and Clayman. But I was disappointd when Reroute came out because I though it lacked the elements that made In Flames stand out the most. The guitar was much less interesting, and the vocals were often irritating in an effort to create vocal melody. Unfortunately, the band pursued all the wrong things from Reroute in recording the new album. It truly is a different band, and the change is unfortunate. I don't want to have to rely on the other Swedish metal gods to provide great music. I want In Flames back. And I'm not the only one."
1,....Why?,"Wow, this sucks. There isn't much more I can say...Whoracle was listenable...but this sh*t just plain sucks. Next thing you know, they'll be going on tour with korn and chevelle."
3,bad first impression,"i have always been aware of in flames as a good band, but never owned a cd. ive heard snippets on this website, and heard good things from friends. so one day i went to the mall and picked up the cheapest in flames album there was...soundtrack to your escape. i liked it so-so at first. then i started getting bored with it. i told my friends this and they told me in flames was really good. i didnt understand the drastic differ in opinian because we always agree on music. as time wore on, i went to websites and looked at in flames and realized that their sound had changed from earlier albums such as clayman and colony. i then realized why i hadnt seen the greatness in in flames.back to the album, im still not all that impressed with it and am still bored with it. dont get me wrong, its...ok...but its still kinda boring and slow. i think ill try colony or whoraclee next. but id advise for you to skip this one. its nothing special."
3,Not their best by a long shot,"Let me just start by saying that i am a huge in flames fan, jesters race, whoracle, colony, clayman, and to a slightly lesser extent Reroute To Remain were all great albums. However i just cannot get into this cd, its to repetative and lacks the cleaver and melodic riffs found in albums like clayman and whoracle. Even Reroute embodied alot of the aspects that made the older albums great but this is just a higher quality nu-metal as far as im concerned, nothing to inventive or groundbreaking. If this is the first in flames cd you hear you will probably like it, but if you are a veteran fan, dont get your hopes up. If your looking for something groundbreaking start with jesters race and work your way up!!"
2,What the hell happened to In Flames??!!,"When this album came out, I was expecting something good. ""Reroute to Remain"" was actually a dissapointment. Good for me that I didn't buy it. I borrowed it and when I put it into my CD player, this made get sad as hell. In Flames used to release great albums. They were the perfect ""melodic"" alternative to Death Metal.You will find a lot of 4 and 5 stars reviews of this album saying that is ""awesome!!!"" but make no mistake. It is not. If you are a fan of Korn, you will love this but for those of us that like In Flames until ""The Clayman"", this is horrible. I gave it 2 stars because it has good vocals and some moments here and there. I recommend their others releases until ""The Claiman"" instead. In Flames is still far away from becoming a fast food Nu Metal band but it seems that they are going in that direction."
3,Decent Recording - But Not My Style,"I was a huge fan of Clayman and Reroute to Remain so I thought I would give Soundtrack a try. While I cannot say this is bad, nothing really grabs my attention. Is this a nu-metal CD? Not really. Does it have some commonalities with nu-metal? Undeniably yes: guitars tuned too low, no solos, simple halting riffs repeated endlessly, shortage of definable melodies, rap-style vocal stylings in places.One of In Flames strengths is that they write intelligent, abstract lyrics and that is the case with Soundtrack. Some of the experimental stuff with acoustic guitars and keyboards also hints at a high level of musical capability and creativity.Ask yourself: Why do I listen to heavy metal? If you primarily listen because you like good lyrics, a decent groove and a rocking production job, you should like Soundtrack to Your Escape. If you listen for complex guitar riffs, wicked solos, and fast headbanging rhythms, then Soundtrack is probably not your cup of tea."
4,Good stuff.,"I wouldnt go so far as to call this new metal, but it doesn't sound like their old work. It continues In Flames's evolution over their last couple albums. If you liked Reroute To Remain, this has a slightly more nu-metal sound, and isn't quite as good. But I do suggest this. In Flames can do no wrong by me."
3,Well....,"While they have come up with a unique sound, its not old In Flames, and that's unfortunate. I personally would have liked this better if they mixed this unusual sound with the complex rhythms and melodies they used to have.What else could I say that hasn't already been said? I like some things about it, and I hate some things about it. Overall, definitely not the greatest album in the world, but it has potential. If In Flames knows what would make themselves sound more badass, they'll combine the old complex melodies they had that (nearly) everyone knows them for with this new sound. Oh, and keep the clean ""korn-esque"" vocals to a minimum. C'mon Anders, you're better than that."
5,Elvolution,"I just got this saturday, and i love it. i'm a huge in flames fan, and of metal in general. Appearently, a lot of people are saying that in flames sounds too nu-metalish now and that their new stuff loses touch with the in flames of old. I love this album, I loved reroute to remain, and i loved their very first cd, Lunar Strain. I will admit that in flames has come a long way from how they sounded on Lunar Strain, but to stay alive, and surge through the on coming tides, you must ""reroute to remain."" you must evolve. that's all they're doing. They're evolving. If you don't evolve, the sound you use becomes tired and played out. In flames is a great band, and always will be. Now get this album, and get in the pit!"
5,BEST OF IN FLAMES!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is what the new millenium death metal should sound, true it sounds new especially with the little mixes and futuristic sounds added, but so perfectly with the speedy riffs like no other and quick deep drum beat sounds it just ""A SOUNDRACK TO YOUR ESCAPE"" i read on another reviewer that it sounded like linkin park and korn put together, well, it just might be in a way BUT i can tell you this...IT IS WAY STRONGER and FASTER BEATS, FASTER RIFFS and it defines METAL unlike korn with week guitar riffs and linkin park... ITS 2004 damn it!!!!!! not the 90's.these guys MAKE NOISE- excellent production!! to me their best album, THIS IF THE FUTURE LOOKING INTO METAL BUY IT!!!(...) IN FLAMES I THINK YOU HIT IT WHERE NO OTHER CAN !!!!!!!!!!"
1,i dont understand!!!!!,"i dont understand how people claim to listen to in flames and yet call "" soundtrack to your escape"" to be the best album by in flames. you are all screwd up in the head. in flames has lost themselves in popularity. this happened when ""reroute to remain"" came out. as soon as their name started gettting big here in the states to where they are acctually played on MTV they start making something that isnt even true swedish death metal. this nu metal bull*!^# has got to stop. i still do love in flames and always will but i guess for now i will be replaying my older albums for alittle while longer."
1,WHY!!!!!!!!!!!,"In Flames has lost the magic. With ""Reroute to Remain"" and now ""Soundtrack to your Escape"" they are a totally different band in my eyes, they went from the most beautiful melodic death metal, to this....this... NU-Metal deathmetal... in my mind its absolutly horrid. I wasted my money buying it, and would like to return it, but I love old In Flames so much that I can't. If you liked ""Reroute to Remain"" then you might find this album to be good. Personally, the lack of melodic guitar riffs that used to fill every In Flames song, and the lack of solos are exremely disapointing. If you look at this band as a new band, totally different from In Flames, maybe this cd would be ok, but I crave the melodic masterpeices of the past. Let the Nu-Metal bands do what they do best, this kind of music is not what In Flames does best."
2,Soundtrack to Mediocrity,"I'll give In Flames credit for being able to run with their formula from ""Reroute to Remain"" which has apparently made them a bit of an MTV darling (Yeah, saw the video for Cloud Connected from RTR on MTV). As anyone knows, In Flames started off as a pretty original (Melodic) Death Metal band, known as Gothenburg Metal. Since those days, many bands have popped up, and none are particularly original. In fact, finding an original Death Metal band these days is quite a task. With this CD, In Flames jumps into the stream of unoriginality. This is by no means a ""bad"" album, but nor is it a good one. I wouldn't call it Nu Metal, but it's by no means anything special. Only hardcore fans of RTR and Nu Metal fans will enjoy this release. For me, I need something with a little more innovation, and a little less formula. A much better band of the ""Gothenburg"" style which you should check out instead is Insomnium."
3,Heavy metal Lutherans,"I liked some of the riffs and tempo of the music. The recording on this album is so high pitched it is hard to turn the volume knob up. Touch of Red is good tempo, my favorite song on the album."
4,A respectable album,"First of all, I'd like to make it clear that I'm not an ""old"" In Flames fan, so my review is not in any way influenced by their previous efforts.This oldschool Swedish metal band really has it all: dynamic vocals, superior guitarist, furious drummer, and originality. ""Soundtrack to your escape"" is a mixed bag of mild thrash metal, nu-metal, and melodic rock. Kicking off the album is an all-out speedy launch in ""Friend"", followed by a series of rather dorment tracks. ""My Sweet Shadow"" perhaps stands out as the strongest track, featuring excellent contrasting passages of growling vocals and harmonic chanting. The fury returns at track 9 (bordres and shading) and the CD finishes strongly with ""bottled"", an angry yet thought-provoking grunge song.In a nut-shell, don't expect this album to be your usual heavy/thrash metal, or what some people term ""not In Flames"". This is an excellent album in its own respect, and deserves much praise for the variety and unique style it offers."
2,soundtrack doesn't compare to previous in flames releases,"soundtrack simply lacks the elements that made in flames stand out in the first place. The guitar harmonies are gone, solos are few, and vocals are not impressive. The riffs arent that interesting either. I am a huge fan of this bands previous works. If you want to hear better in flames listen to whoracle, colony, or the jester race."
3,It's a fun listen,"I have mixed feeling for this CD that is for sure. I love the older In Flames sound, that stuff just blows me away every time I listen to it. Some of their more recent stuff hasn't been as amazing not mentioning any names... anyway... This CD in all honesty isn't bad, but it certainly isn't their best work. The CD gets a 3 for that reason, it isn't a masterpiece but it isn't a waste, give it a listen if you like In Flames you will like it, but it won't rank as high as Lunar Strain and Coloney."
4,progression,"This album really grows on me. It's getting better and better.Yes, it different than Colony, Clayman, Whoracle etc. But hey, you can't expect they make such brilliant albums again and again. I have respect for their decission to make a different album. I was a little disappointed by their former album RTR (although it had some really nice songs). This album sounds more like a solid one. And people who call it NU metal.....ok it has some influences, but it is definately not NU metal. They remain IN FLAMES and stay original! Really nice melodies (even without the great twin guitar melodies I like so much)."
5,Progression is not selling out,"I disagree with anyone who says In Flames has sold out. These guys are such a great band and have been around for quite some time. I like everything they've done from ""The Jester Race/Black Ash Inheritence"" to ""Soundtrack To Your Escape"". In Flames in my opinion have found the perfect formula to mix the swedish death metal style with melodic metal. To top that when I've seen them live they are on point. I think alot of people have trouble with the keyboards and samples that In Flames uses. And I will admit I really don't care for keyboards or samples myself but like I said In Flames has found a way to bring these things together so they fit."
4,nice,"This is a classic case of a band outgrowing their fans. You may want them to keep playing the same stuff over and over, but obviously, they don't - and that makes for a great progression.I'll bet the guys knocking this album are the same ones who complained when Sepultura's Roots came out, or when No Use For A Name released their current record, or when.. well I could go on."
4,"second worst album, but still good","I will start off by saying that this is way better than reroute to remian. It is much heavier, and more melodic. the major problem with STYE is there are almost NO guitar solos. The standout tracks ""f(r)iend"", ""my sweet shadow"", and ""dial 595-escape"". ""the quiet place"", the single from this cd, is the worst song on this album-it sounds like a song that korn would do. ""borders and shading"" and ""in search for i"" are also pretty good too.the reason that this album is their second worst is because they have made so many excellent albums in the past(whoracle and the jester race the best). This album is not even close to the greatness of allof thier other albums(except R2R), but it is still a great cd."
4,I like it...,"If you are new to more extreme metal, like I am, then you will probably like this album, like me. It seems like a lot of long time in flames lovers do not like this album, but as a first-time in flames listener I thought it was great. My favorite bands are Tool and Opeth, and I also have been listening to Hypocrisy and Into Eternity a lot lately, to give you some perspective on my review...this album reminded me of Korn, but a lot harder and better. I'm looking forward to nabbing their older stuff that all the long-time IN Flames fans seem to love, like Whoracle, Jester's race, and Clayman. Hopefully they will live up to the reviewer hype I have read."
4,Different.,"This is a different kind of In Flames. Not the one you knew, or heard on Colony, Whoracle, or even Reroute to Remain. Its not a bad cd, however it takes a while to get used to. The first time I heard it I wanted to shoot it with a M16 because I thought it sucked so bad. But it grows on you. It really does. I have been listening to it for the last 2 hours straight absorbing every bit of it in. Give it a try, and don't flame it because its not the Clayman In Flames or its not the In Flames you thought it would be. This cd is a nice change, however I wish they would have made one more like Colony or Clayman, but I can get into this."
4,New to Metal,"In flames new CD - Soundtrack to your escape is a very good CD from what i've heard. I'm new to the whole Death Metal/ Black Metal scene, but although i've heard their old stuff was better,this cd is worth every penny. in fact i'm gonna buy it today!Has some sounds of nu-metal, but very much classic metal.the 3 tracks i like the best are:Quiet Place - very melodic with screaming! 4/5Touch of Red - another melodic song with cool ending 5/5Like you better Dead - 1st song i heard from them, chorus is awesome. 5/5"
1,nu metal crap,"THIS FUNNY BECAUSE I WROTE A REVIEW OF THIS ALBUM ESTATING HOW CRAPPY I FELT WHEN I LISTENED TO IT. I AM LAUGHING BECAUSE SOME OF YOU TOOK THEM (MY REVIEW) FOR REAL....A BIT TOO SERIOUS. REMEMBER PEOPLE THAT IT IS JUST MUSIC, AND BANDS DONT CARE, BUT IF U WANT TO DEFEND OF WHAT IT WAS A GREAT BAND, HERE IS AGAIN...THIS BAND SUCKS!!!!!"
1,If there was any doubt...,"... That they were going downhill, Soundtrack to Your Escape is the nail in the coffin. I'm escaping alright, ESCAPING FROM EVER HAVING TO LISTEN TO THIS FILTH MORE THAN ONCE(I CAN MAKE BAD PUNS IF THEY CAN MAKE HORRIBLE MUSIC). I actually didn't even listen to it, I got to song 2, where he sounds EXACTLY like the singer from KORN of all bands.To be honest, compared to Reroute To Remain they took a step forward. They went from sounding like a distorted version of Slipknot to sounding like a Lamb of God clone. In fact if this was not In Flames I probably would have given this 3 stars, maybe even 4 if I was in a good mood. But compare this to Whoracle, The Jester Race, Colony, or even Clayman... it's simply terrible. The super melodic guitars are gone, they were what basically characterized In Flames, and they replace them with dull metalcore guitars.(...)"
1,this isnt in flames,in flames? what happened? what the hell is this? sounds like a mix of insanity and calmness. do you need a straight jacket guys?this is not death metal... in flames was one of my last music get aways and now its gone. damn it.reguardless of my heartbreak ill give a reviewF(R)I@nd 6.5/10 Super awesome power start but the chorus made me laughThe Quiet Place 6/10 demented begining picks up a bit but then you got the uber sad vocals wuss to the max?DEAD ALONE 5/10 an ok song what everTough Of red 7/10 one of the only songs i find not devoid of some kind of technics i enjoyed this song only a 7 for the vocalsLike You Better Dead 1/10 Like This Song Better Deadi cant go anyone more i stopped listening to the cd after thatthis review is not based on lyrics sound factor only consider this
1,what happened guys??,"hi i am an avid in flames fan, well use to be however when i lsitened to this..... i thought this cd was ok but then again it plainly sucked. reroute to remain has soem godo parts to it but this change in the bands direction seems that they have left their melodic death metal style behind and copied off of everyone else. to me this sound sjust like another nu or metalcore cd. please give me a break guys. the vocals are horrible and the sound is so distorted that i cant even hear anything. i spell doom for in flames very soon."
1,"You can't escape how awful ""Soundtrack"" is","Lazy...uninspired...just plain awful. Get Anders into therapy, bring back the melodic guitar harmonies, and forget the ""Houston, we have a problem"" sound effects. Maybe THEN you'd have a decent In Flames album."
3,"Good for most bands, not for In Flames","Alright, I'm not going to come out and attack this album just because I prefer their older material. I actually enjoy listening to ""The Quiet Place"", and there are a few other pretty decent songs on here, but when I play this CD, I do it while mentally shutting out the fact that it's In Flames.There is definately a place for this album, and if you are a fan of KoRn, Godsmack, Slipknot, or any other bands in that vein, there is a fair chance you'll enjoy this.I assume, however, that if you are an old In Flames fan you've already purchased and ranted about this release years ago."
3,Meh...nothing special,"This is a lot like Reroute to Remain - part 2. Ever since they started working in the clean vocals I have liked In Flames less and less. It's not that I'm opposed to clean vocals in death metal in general, it's just that not many bands sound good doing it. And In Flames has particularly whiny, lame-sounding clean vocals. The songs aren't necessarily bad, but they all have that point - you can feel it coming, their structures have gotten so predictable - where in come the grandiose chords and yup, there's another awful clean singing part. For me it just ruins the whole song, so there's really not a song on here I can listen to all the way through. If you can deal with the clean vocals, I guess this album isn't all that bad, but it's pretty much the same as Reroute to Remain. Give me Soilwork's Figure Number Five over this anyday."
5,Simply Awesome,To be honest with you i hadn't bought an album of In Flames ever until i seen The Quiet Place on MTV Headbangers Ball. I got hooked and i went out and bought the album. Talk about an awesome record. I enjoy about every song on this record and cant stop playing it. If you are looking for an new addition to your rock collection pick this one up!
5,Soundtrack to Your Escape,This is probably one of my favorite In Flames albums. If you haven't heard this album yet I would definitely recommend this to any In Flames or Swedish death metal bands.
5,...,"As a 5 year fan of In Flames with each cd, i'd have to say this is by far my favorite release. I literally have no idea why this album gets put down so much. Pretty frustrating. This album practically changed my life. Stop crying over spilt swedish death metal."
4,If you don't like it then buy something else!,"This happens all the time. Fans of a band's older music desperately cling to the old days, and when a band releases something that sounds different, they get a burr up their a** every time and write bad reviews whether they give an album a chance or not. This is a pretty good CD -- not their best but good. I have been a fan of In Flames for a long time (besides this CD I own Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony, Clayman, R2R). Yes, their style has changed, but after so many albums what do you expect? If they didn't change people would be complaining about THAT. What exactly do you want?If you are looking for a rehash of In Flames older music, there are plently of other bands out there ripping it off right now. Go buy their CD's."
4,"As good as Old In Flames? No, but its still good....","I agree with many of the other reviewers, You can not compare to albums like Whoracle, Jester Race and Colony.......BUT the new album, with the exception of "" The Quiet Place "" has a generally good flow to it. The riffs are excellent, with the exception of solo's, I still feel the guitar work and overall CD is much better than Reroute to Remain. My suggestion to everyone is to check out the new killswitch engage album that is coming out May 11th....you won't be disappointed."
2,SUPER STINKY,Oh my goodness this thing is the perfect size. It leaves a generous amount for you to hold at the bottom too. The only thing is it reeks. You HAVE to use a condom on it because its just that strong. No joke. I took it in the shower and washed it off like 10 times then in the sink with different soaps and it just did not help. So basically-Its the perfect size but its super smelly.
4,It's a big boy!,"This definitely goes on the right end of the bell curve for size. Being in the middle of the bell curve myself I bought this for my wife as a joke. We laughed about it every time we got into the toy box for a couple of weeks. Then one night she announced that she wanted to try to use it for it's intended purpose, not just as comic relief. I quickly agreed because I'd been thinking the same thing but didn't want to force it on her. We lubed it up real good and played with it awhile but never got it fully inserted. The wife was excited about the potential though and is anxious to keep trying. We look forward to continuing to play with it and hope that some day soon she can fully use what we now call ""The Big Boy""."
4,huge!,"i love this dildo! be advised though, it is pretty massive! it takes a bit of effort to use for an extended amount of time. the shipping was super fast also and i love the purple color. the only downside is that after washing, no matter where i set it, it attracts hair and dust and fuzz immediately."
1,IT SMELLS!,i had to throw it away because i could not take the smell. I thought that the smell was going to go away after a couple of days but it didn't.it felt really good but i could not handle the smell.
4,Over Her Dead Body,She starts off slow but picksup. She is a writer with a sense of humor and sophistication. Carla Neggars would be proud.
5,A must have....,This is a great release. Too bad it wasn't released when Joe was alive. This a great archive for not only Joe Strummer/Clash fans but for those interested in the history of underground music. It is very interesting to hear echo's and threads of the 101'ers in Streetcore. Many of these 30 year old 101'ers songs have more energy and vitality than much of what is released today. Letsagetabitarockin'....
5,great pub rock,"great pub rock and general rock from this pre clash outfit from the mid 70s, this does not sound at all like th clash did but im sure this band played alongside all the london pub rock greats of the time with the likes of dr feelgood, kilboun and the high roads, eddie and the hot rods, and ducks deluxe as well as tyla gang, then again tyla gang did not start until 76 when the clash did,"
4,Old habits die hard,"I've been using this style of At At Glance appointment book since 1984. Now I just get refills. I like it because I can see each day and each week easily, but it does not have the hourly lines that limit the possibilities of the day. But my big complaint is that since 2008, they have done away with the soothing blue paper and have been using a cheaper grade of paper where the ink shows through to the other side. I've sent messages to the company, but to no avail. I'd even pay more if they'd offer the option. But overall, I do like this style of appointment book, and that I can refill it every year."
4,amazing versatility,"The Jody Grind were one of the most interesting roots-rock/country groups of the early '90's & a showcase andspringboard for a distinctive singer, Kelly Hogan. This album is an eclectic mix of country, blues, & ""classic pop""standards, dipped occasionally in Georgia Southern Gothic imagery and touches of various folk rhythms. Perhaps a bit too eclecticat times-- but it would have been interesting to see where the group might have gone. Essential though for any Hogan fan, and definitely of interest for anyone with a taste for alternative country, roots rock or country blues."
4,The Jody Grind - One Man's Trash,"An eclectic mix of original and cover songs. A strong flavor of blues permeates this album with a hint of country and big band sound. The stronger titles, by far, within this album are the band's own titles. Kelly Hogan's voice dominates this album and rightfully so. Her voice has remained one of our favorites for the past 9 years. It is sad that the life of this band was ended so tragically. I continue to hope to hear this sound in the future."
3,"good, but.....","The rack does it's job, but the dumbbells are very hard to get on and remove. I like the fact that it is small, but could be easier design."
3,Serves the purpose,"I purchased this rack because it would hold the number of weights I had. It is rather poorly constructed (loose fittings etc). My husband is fairly handy and said it was a pain to put together! The pieces fit together poorly, and did not match up well. Once it was together it served the purpose and keeps my weights together so they are not laying all over the room."
3,Perfect for wild mood swings,"On this alternative rock album (hardcore?), the male vocalist is at one point singing very beautifully, and the next instant he's growling or screaming, then he suddenly goes back to his beautiful singing. Refreshing, unique."
5,To Scream or Not to Scream...,"Wow we Wow Wow, This album is great. This band generates so much energy just from their cd. 4 Wall Black Mail is one of my Favorite albums of all time. If you're a fan of, Blindside, Project 86, Lucerin Blue, Thursday, Finch, A Static Lullaby, Glassjaw, and even At the Drive-in i would guarantee you'd like this band. I'd even go as far as saying if you were displeased with this album i'd refund your money..but.. HAHAHA. but since i know you'd like it i won't bother. peace and God bless"
5,Good products,"My mom likes them. The package was fast, and protected them well.So I'm happy about my purchasing.Nice :)"
3,It's just okay.,"Have been using cream for about a month, and it's just okay, nothing special. Not very rich feeling on skin; does not moisturize any differently than other low price creams. Will not buy it, again."
2,"Loreal moisturizers ""pill""","I don't know why, but this product and other Loreal skin care products I have used ""pill"" on my face. If you rub an area of skin, to be sure the product has been distributed, little rolls of the moisturizer form and then need to be removed from your face. I much much prefer neutrogena and olay brands because they soak in completely."
1,Island Dogs Suck!,"This company sucks. They charged my card, then informed me that they didn't have my product and that they were canceling my order. I got my money back, but this company is the pits. I wouldn't order anything from them. Ever!"
5,Buy this one - avoid cheaper switching power supplies,Works as described. Great price. Be careful to avoid cheaper switching power supplies as they may overheat or burn out electronic devices. This unit is not a switching PS. You can get test leads in a variety of configurations that fit this unit from Radio Shack - inexpensive.
1,Worst Textbook EVER,"This is by far the worst textbook I've ever been forced to use for a class. The author provides virtually no example problems with clearly demonstrated solutions, repeatedly skips large portions of derivations and proofs, and introduces new concepts in the problem sets for each chapter with little or no explanation. He makes sure to include comments like ""clearly, ..."" after jumping 14 steps in a derivation or proof just so you know he's so much smarter than you. I'm going to burn it at the end of the semester."
5,Un mundo mejor,"El especial atractivo, derivado no sólo de su voz sino también de su personalidad, que siempre atesoró Victoria de los Angeles hace su aparición sutil pero implacablemente en este singular CD. El oyente va siendo poco a poco atrapado por ese ambiente a la vez íntimo, trascendente y sensual que sin remedio creaba la artista en sus recitales. Belleza, sensibilidad, encanto y un algo de inefable magia nos transportan a un mundo ya lejano del que resulta doloroso tener que arrancarse."
5,Five Stars,"These books are some of the best of the series. Number six, The Crowning Terror, a young woman named Charity complicates the case. Number seven, Deathgame, is a must read book. It involves physical and mental capabilities, perfect for the genius and athlete. Number eight is the first where Callie tries to become involved in cases and ends up getting more than she hoped for. Number nine, The Genius Thieves, had an excellent plot and exciting scenes. Next, Hostages of Hate, involves terrorists, a hijacked plane and Callie, who is being held on it. Brother against Brother, one of my personal favorites, is about Joe and his lost memory. Will he realize that Frank's not a hit man or will he discover that in time? Read all these books and see for yourself!"
2,BUYER BEWARE-Read the Dimensions,"Make sure you take a hard look at the dimensions. I expected this toy to be the size of a standard Jack-in-the-box and its significantly smaller. It's small enough to fit in my daughters stocking rather than go under the tree. Given the size, its overpriced."
1,not made for kids,This is not only small but the metal is sharp. Dog has to be pushed back in so hard that a child cannot do this by himself. Very disappointed.
3,Okay toy,"This was a Birthday gift for my 2 year old. It is cute. It is very small but she is able to turn the crank to hear the song and watch the dog pop out. The problem is that the it is hard to shut the dog back in the box so she can start again. I have to help her and even then it can be difficult. The tiny latch does not snap into the closed position until a couple of cranks after the song has ended. I have to watch for it, if I go past that position to quickly it wont lock properly and we have to play the whole song again before I can try to close it again. My little one does enjoy it, but I think we would both have enjoyed a bigger, less touchy one more."
3,"Cute toy, but pretty small","This is a cute little jack-in-the-box and our toddler likes it .... we've had it for about 6 months and my only complaint would be that the handle has bent and so it's difficult to turn. Otherwise, it's been worth the money we spent on it - a nice little toy."
4,good gift,"my grand daughter liked this gift. great company to work with, will buy here again. the toy is good, just a little small, or perhaps my grand daughter was too young...her older brothers and sisters loved it!!"
2,It's ok but small,"This jack-in-the-box is very small. The base fits in the palm of my adult hand. The latch is not very sturdy and it already is hard to keep the lid shut for the next turn. It only plays, ""How much is that doggie in the window? I do hope that doggie's for sale."" and then pops up. Overall, I thought it was going to be a bargain...and I got what I paid for which was very little."
1,"Descent, but not great","By no means was I expecting the British version of The Office to be like the American version, but I was shocked at the crass and vulgar language. I was not compelled to continue watching the show. I think that it is important for others realize the nature of the content prior to purchasing."
1,I wish mine was the hardwood..,"Well, I guess I will never know. Ordered the wooden handle so that I could easily cut it to a shorter length since that seems to be the only option to get a normally sized handle from Wolf-Garten. Cut the aluminum handle down with much more effort. Not happy."
4,Winning,"One of the first things to note about this album is that it is an audiophile recording made live direct to two track analog by an excellent company, Audioquest. It bathes you in the sound to a degree rare among Jazz recordings. The performances are mostly first rate. On the few selections where Calderazzo plays alone with his trio, he really burns up the joint. The other selections feature arrangements by Bob Belden. They are very evocative, using Jazz and Classical instruments. Occasionally I wish they would give Calderazzo more room to improvise. Nevertheless, this is a beautifully recorded album by excellent musicians and it gave me a lot of pleasure."
1,Repackaged Seconds,Whoever supplies for Amazon should be fired. These nails are obviously factory seconds. The nails were thrown in a generic box like a rat's nest (not the manufacturer's box) with most of the stick nails damaged. The nails could not be used in a nail gun as per the manufacturer....the nails were not complete sticks...just bits and pieces. (Think of trying to load a stapler with individual staples and you will get a sense of how these nails arrived.)
4,Good work book.,"I bought this work book three years after my last Spanish course because I was going to retake Spanish and wanted to refresh my memory. Practice is definitely the best way to learn and remember a language, and this work book was sufficient and helpful. I actually enjoyed the exercises, although some are ovelry simplified. I'm not sure how good this book would be for someone without previous courses in Spanish, but it worked well for me. The explanatory sections are short and clear, and are followed by exercises pertaining to the lessons. The book builds upon previous chapters. I also tried the Barron's Spanish series, which are much thicker and somewhat clumsy. I liked both the ""Practice Makes Perfect"" and ""Barron's"" series, but I think that the former is more comprehensive and probably best for someone who is reviewing Spanish."
3,Sitting on the shelf,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought it expecting a good and thorough workbook on Spanish grammar, which it is thorough. However, it's frustrating because some of the exercises don't seem to ""go with"" what the chapter is covering. There's a translation exercise at the end of each chapter and after dutifully translating as I had just studied, I turn to the back and the answers are completely different. There are some glaring errors in the book too. Example: ""Mi hermano cumplio treinta..."" is translated as ""my brother turned twenty"". If a beginner such as me can catch this - it's glaring. The frustration was so great that after struggling through 3 chapters, the book now sits on the shelf - a bad place for books. I've since purchased The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice and am working along quickly with this user-friendly and consistent book."
5,Great book for an Intermediate who needs to review grammar,"This book is great, however it is not for an absolute beginner. One needs to have some vacabulary and some knowledge of grammar. It's great for grammar review and for someone who already speaks spanish but needs to brush up on skills. Also the book contains plenty of exercises with correct answers at the end of the book, so you can check your progress. In addition to just checking the grammar, some exercises involve translation.Do not buy this book unless your spanish level is at least at lower intermediate level.The structure of the book is a bit different from the books I am used to: It starts not with nouns, adjectives, numbers and prepositions, as most of the books do, but from learning the spanish tenses: present, preterit, imperfect, future, subjunctive. At the end, the book goes into nouns, prepositions, etc."
3,Spanish Grammer,Practice Makes Perfect is good but being a beginner found it a little difficult to follow and understand all workbook assignment short quizes. The intermediate student would have no problem.
2,Can be very frustrating and difficult for beginners...,"I bought this book thinking it would be a great all in one workbook/textbook to use to teach myself Spanish. However, after the first few exercises, I found it to be exceedingly frustrating to use. Some things are not explained well at all, and as other reviewers have noted there are several errors in the answer key. Also, several of the exercises use words that have not been introduced beforehand and are not in the included dictionary in the back of the book. I suppose you could carry around a dictionary as well but having to constantly go back and fourth would become annoying rather quickly. This book now it sits at the bottom of my bookshelf and I doubt I will use it again any time soon."
1,The pluscoamperfecto of the direct objective pronoun parallels the indicative subjunctive modifier...,"...which parallels the subjective subjunctive prounoun, in the potential simple perfect modifying adjective of the imperfect preterite preceding the........ BLAH BLAH BLAH. Obviously, I didn't copy that jibberish word-for-word from the book, but I might as well have. It's just as boring - and helpful.When will I stop trying to learn from PhD's who live to over-complicate things? I bought this book 3 years ago and every few months, I take it out, dust it off, and try to learn something from it. Each time I end up throwing it across the room in disgust.Looking to learn Spanish? Unless you have a PhD in English, this book will probably just confuse you and thus destroy your confidence."
3,Complete Spanish Grammar,"As a new learner of the Spanish language, I found the Complete Spanish Grammar not adequate. Right from the second exercise 1-2 on page 3 the learner should already know how to translate sentences with no vocabulary, articles or possessive pronouns preparation etc. I can understand the first exercise 1-1 p. 3 where you have to conjugate the verb because they already have shown how to do that on page one and two but not the translation."
3,Not bad,"This was much easier to comprehend than most of the ""Practice Makes Perfect"" books. It was definitely for beginners. This was the first book in the series that I got, so it was a good place to begin."
1,"Do not buy the Kindle edition if you are using a Kindle with a 6"" screen","Do not buy the Kindle edition of this book if you are using a Kindle with a standard 6"" screen. The product description says: ""This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on devices with larger screens such as Kindle DX, Kindle for PC/Mac, and Kindle for iPad."" It clearly has not been optimized for reading on Kindles with 6"" displays. Most of the book's many tables are difficult to read and some are virtually impossible. I bought this book because my wife and I have used and enjoyed the paperback version of the first edition, but I returned this one within minutes of purchasing it because it was too difficult to read."
5,This should be a textbook in high school Spanish classes,"Seriously, this book makes Spanish so much more accessible. It beats out cheesy textbooks with bad storylines and contrived writing passages. All of my Spanish came back to me, this time with ""oh yeah! of course! moments. Nissenberg makes it all make sense. On more than one occassion, I found myself thinking, ""This makes so much sense!"" There are plenty of translation exercises for those of us who need to brush up on our written Spanish.I have been pleased with the Practice Makes Perfect series for Spanish and French. Complete Spanish Grammar is the proof that this series is so worth the money. (And the books are so affordable, too!) Whenever I want to buy a Spanish or French workbook, I always look for Practice Makes Perfect!"
2,Thorough but full of mistakes,"I have been studying Spanish for 7+ years and used this book as a text book in a college course that focused on the verb conjugations and tenses. We did about 90% of the exercises in the book. It's very thorough with the material that it covers, but the answers in the back are full of so many mistakes that the book almost isn't worth it. It was frustrating for us students to use the book and check our answers only to find mistakes. Eventually our professor stopped using the book."
2,not complete at all,"If you're going to entitle your book ""A Complete Grammar of ...."" you must live up to your promise. This author does not. You must talk about the parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc). This the author does.But you must also talk about sentence-writing: subordinate clauses,coordination, word order, etc. This the author does NOT. She only mentions the use of the subjunctive in subordinate clauses but does not dwell on the clauses.Therefore, this is NOT a complete grammar at all. I'm a linguist and I know what I'm talking about. I'm not saying the book is bad:I'm saying it didn't deliver what it promised in the title"
1,Did not receive,"I did not receive this book, and have requested to have the order cancelled and my account credited. I bought the book at Barnes & Noble."
1,What Went Wrong?,Amazon took order Dec 21USPS Customs form filled in & sent Dec 21Email confirmation from Amazon telling me order shipped and estimated delivery Dec 31GM Priority Mail and Tracking sticker put on Amazon box Jan 14USPS Delivery Confirmation sticker on box 91-0206 9746 0430 1722 0810Box received at my Post Office Jan 17
4,Good tool,I like the grammar book and am using it. But it is a work book. Which requires work. what was I thinking?
2,The book repeats itself by making the same points over and over.,"I gave it a 2 because it had some good resource information.By the time I finished reading it, all I could think was that I wanted my time back.This book will give you little information on the current market and rates that are being paid.At best, the book will site individuals who describe their compensation as, Adequate, fair, low, comfortable.""These relative terms are in the context of very anecdotal personal interviews.This seems like a good idea but while the book glosses over the personal stories in such a general way that you learn nothing, it labors specifics that add nothing to the picture of what it is to be a legal assistant.I bought this book for a penny but it cost me too much time with no return."
4,.... more than just good hair,"Start with 77 and early eighties influences, add beer, the best hair in the business and a heavy dose of punk pride and attitude and you have the Casualties. This is a good album to start with if you are not familiar with the Casualties, or if you want to re-visit the experience of one of their live shows. The Casualties are for real!"
4,uhm...i like the casualties...yea...,"Ok, starting off, i really like the casualties...this was in my opinion one of their better albums, the topic of songs range from all sortsa things and they're just really upbeat and great to sing and have a lot of energy to them....this would have to be my favorite out of both for the punx and underground army, but ive yet to hear the early years...as always the casualties put on a great show, and listening to for the punx (even tho i own the LP, which is the sound is far more exceptional on) it takes me back to their shows...it was the first casualties album id ever bought and the one i favor most...enjoy it..."
3,something we could live without,"For the Punx gets 3 stars from me simply because it can be fun to listen to at times. Warning: its very easy to be drawn in by the image of these guys looking overly ""punked out"" on the cover of this record. The content however, is sorely lacking. There is very little intelligence to be had. Consider this: ""Oi! We are the spikey haired drunk punks!"" Jorge and the gang play their game with a great deal of enthusiasm, and they seem to enjoy what they do. But if you're looking for something that will wake up your brain, even just a little, I would recommend eschewing them in favor of anything by New Jersey's Lower East Side Stitches, who show that American streetpunk bands are capable of talent and intelligence. The Casualties, however, are just a bit too full of themselves and their fashion to be taken seriously at any level."
5,The ultimate CD for Madeline lovers!,"I bought this for my sister, who is 3, for Christmas along with a Madeline doll.She loves it! When I put the CD in for her she was shocked to hear the songs from some of her favorite Madeline cartoons, and started singing along and dancing. Now whenever I put a CD in she asks me to put her special Madeline CD in!Also the songs are cute and not completely irritating as many kids' songs are in my opinion, so the adults are ripping their eardrums out!"
5,Excellent Music,"My daughter and I love this cd. The songs are wonderful and everytime my daughter hears a song, she remembers the episode that it played on. Very good buy."
5,Interesting and Captivating,"Cursed is a great one-shot read. It's a little confusing at first but once you understand more about the story you just keep reading; wondering what's gonna happen next; who you're gonna meet next; why was that moment so important? Personally, I thought it was a wonderful book and I just kept going back and reading the parts I like the most, found fascinating, didn't quite get until later. It's one of those books you'll think about later and just want to pick up and read through again. The Cursed, absolutely loved them. The tragedy, the quirkiness of their personality, the gift and curse. If you like a good book with a great plot I highly suggest this one. I've reread it four times and I still keep thinking about it and wanting more."
4,Hardcore for the Hardcore,"Some songs that were known in underground NYC clubs long before they received radio airplay. From the dayze when the dance was almost everything. I was there, Thank God!!!"
4,Characters that I cared about,I enjoyed the audio cassette version of this book. The characters were easy to relate to and I found myself caring about them and wanting the book to last longer so that I could know the outcome for every secondary character.
4,a very enjoyable book,"Although this book is not quite as captivating as Ms. Letts' first book WHERE THE HEART IS, I enjoyed the character development and cared about what happened to them. As a Texan married to an Oklahoman, I was drawn to a book about an area of the country with which I am familiar. But the relationships do transcend the regional flavor of the book. I like the way Ms. Letts writes, and I like her characters. I hope she will continue as she has begun, and I will continue to recommend her books to family and friends."
2,Could've been better,"After ""Where the Heart Is"" I expected so much more. Don't get me wrong; the storyline is fine and all, but the characters weren't up to the task of carrying it. Bui Khan, what in the world happened to him at the end of the novel? You never find out. It's not like one of those sentimental well-ending novels where this device works. And Vena Takes Horse was so complex that she was unclear. And the sideplot about her sister was never fleshed out. Like another 2-star reviewer said, if only Letts didn't feel pressured with the Oprah thing for her first novel, this book could've really been something."
5,U Gotta Luv it !,It was a great book and I couldn't put it down a friend loan it to me and I started at 5:50 pm and at 11:10 Pm finished I didn't want it to end I hope she writes a new one with the same people I think it would be a great one for all to read ........Bravo !
4,Enjoyable,"I read this book because I enjoyed Where the Heart Is so much. This book isn't quite as good as that one, but an enjoyable read just the same."
3,It's okay,Wasn't my favorite Billie Letts book. A lot of the characters seemed irrelevant to the context of the story. Will keep reading her books.
5,"Part of the family of the ""Honk"" characters.","The characters were wonderful, and what a mix of personalities that all blended as a family. It was just so pleasant to read -- so heartwarming. I didn't want it to end. I read an average of 3 books a week, and of all that I have read this year to date, I enjoyed this the most. I probably liked it at least as well as ""Where the Heart Is"" but I think I will remember this family of characters longer."
4,A Page Turner,"I was delighted with the cast characters that paraded across the page. Although somewhat stereotypical, each character is entertaining and engaging, and keeps you wondering ""what happens next."" A vivid adventure into the heartland and a pleasure to read!"
5,A Great book by Billie Letts,This book has such odd-ball characters that are so down home that I couldn't put the book down. I loved this story and passed it on to my friends who loved it as well.
5,Another hit by Letts,"I enjoyed the Honk and Holler, just as much as Where the Heart Is. Billie Letts has done it again. It's a heart warming, but never sappy, novel about a real cross section of Americans. I'm especially glad to see a Vietnamese immigrant given a high profile; and he was my favorite character. Her dialog and situations, as usual, are very believable and come off as quite natural. Highly recommended."
5,Honk if you liked this book...HONK!,Billie Letts writes to the center of the heart. THE HONK AND HOLLER OPENING SOON is a story to open your heart. The characters share their lives and loves with some heartbreak along the way. You'll find yourself cheering for them. This is one of Letts' best efforts. Read it and HONK!
5,Excellent book!,"This is a real 'feel good' book despite some of the unpleasant situations. The characters were as real as they get as were the true to life dramas played out in this small town. A thoroughly enjoyable book, one I would read again if I hadn't already passed it on."
5,Fabulous storytelling!,"In my opinion, Billie Letts is an extremely gifted story teller. She has a knack for making even the simplist person seem like the most complex character ever known. Unfortunately, if you do not have an open mind to ""storytelling"" possibilities, this gem of a book may go right over your head. If you allow yourself to just be taken in with the story, the characters, etc., I guarantee you will not be able to put this book down, and it will then lead you to other books written by Billie Letts. It's fun, enjoyable reading with an element of truth behind it. Happy reading!"
4,Touches my heart deeply,"This bookfs drama takes place in a rural area in the U.S. Characters in the book has individual unique personality and backgrounds, although the relationships of characters are not too complicated. The relationships and influences to other characters are also interesting. The author describes the scenery carefully, so that I can imagine what is going on easily even though I am an international student. Love between a man and a woman, mother and daughter, or human and animals make me more eager to read, I could not wait what would happen in the next chapter. I usually do not finish reading a book, but this book is different. Youfll not be bored the story as you read more, and stop reading until you finish."
4,life of Honk and Holler,"At first, it was not intresting at all. But in the end of this story, I feel so happy. Caney, Vena, Bui and Molly O are not family. But each of them beccame a part of the family. Even though they don't have any blood relationship, they could become the the family. The human is very lonesome. However, they became family by taking care of each other. The important thing is the trustful relationship of the human mind. If we miss it, we will not be a part of the family any more."
5,Billie Letts has my attention for sure!!!!!,"""The Honk and Holler""....was absolutely fantastic!!! Caney Paxton was injured in Vietnam and when he came home in a wheelchair, he never went outside. MollyO, his faithful partner at the ""Honk"", is a mother of a teenage daughter who has run off. Together the run the ""Honk"" and have regular customers every day, but not a booming business. Then along comes Vena Takes Horse, and the whole place changed. Vena decided Caney needed ""curbside sevice"", so she took to carhopping in the parking lot. Caney falls in love with Vena. Also on the working crew is Bui, an immigrant from Viet Nam. Vena and Bui finally get Caney outside in a surprising way. This is a great story, and I loved it almost as much as ""Where The Heart Is."" Ten thumbs up for this one!!!!"
3,Unforgettable characters in a rather stilted plot,"Ms. Letts draws some truly funny, unique characters in this story, and offers a straight look at the workings of a small town diner, but the story really felt like a neatly-tied soap opera. Though I loved the characters, and some of their moments made me laugh out loud, their fates seemed so predictable and cheesy. This is an engrossing book, I read it on a plane, and it kept me occupied and interested. I just wish she had applied some of the originality she found for her characters to the story. They deserved better than the canned, corny ending."
4,"A Lovely, Very Human Story","Ms. Letts continues to make the world smaller with each offering. Although my personal experience is as far from small town Oklahoma as is possible on this continent, the folks who frequent the The Honk and Holler were as real to me as my own eclectic band of cohorts here in over-stressed, over-achieving, over-mortaged suburban D.C. The Honk and Holler Opening Soon was a most satisfying read, a welcomed break and a perfect reminder that in the end we are all the same."
2,As Nutritious As Chewing Gum,"The Honk and Holler is a tired truck stop, run by a tired owner, and patronized by tired regulars. The place is spiced up when vagabond Vena Takes Horse appears (followed shortly by another refugee, Bui Khanh), but the story needs more than a dash of seasoning.The flyleaf reads, ""the characters who drift in and out of the Honk..."" That aptly describes the characters: they drift in and out. It makes for a jumble of a story and leaves the reader constantly wondering how their circumstances tie together. Other than the restaurant, there seemed to be no common thread. It's hard to avoid comparison of the solid, passionate characters of WHERE THE HEART IS with the stick figures of THE HONK AND HOLLER. If only Ms. Letts hadn't been rushed to follow up the Oprah success; perhaps she would have been able to add meat to their bones."
3,Small Town Cafe,"Honk and Holler Opening Soon is a small roadside café in a small town in Oklahoma. Although twelve years the ""opening soon"" is a town joke.The café is ran by Caney, a Vietnam vet confined to a wheelchair after losing both legs; and Molly O, a boisterous widow woman who helped raise Caney. Life in the usually quiet small town café turns a 180 when two out-of-towners show up looking for work. The first is a Native American woman, Vena Takes Horse. Vena hitched a ride with a trucker who drops Vena and a wounded dog off at the café. The other is a Vietnamese immigrant, Bui, who is saving so his wife can join him in America.The plot includes twists and turns including the budding romance developing between Caney and Vena, the secrets each of the characters are harboring and a local's dislike for Bui.Letts, an Oklahoma native, creates a true picture of the happenings in a small town café."
3,Honk and Holler,"Overall, this is a good book because it encourages people to forget the distress and just go ahead. But I think the plots and contents are too simple. When I read this novel, I almost could image what would happen in the next step. The story seems to follow a formula, like a man, Canny, was reborn because he loved a woman, Vena, and so does the woman. And other people, like Bui and Molly O, also overcame their problems. Seriously it is a warm story, but nothing special. Therefore it didn't leave any inspiring or impressive ideas in my mind and didn't really touch me. Nevertheless, I think the author is good at writing. She used many details such as the movements to describe each people and is successful to build each person's character. If you are seeking something unique, I don't recommend this book. But you can consider it as pastime and read it in amusement."
5,Read in one day!,A very upbeat relevant and current story- would appeal to high school students to read ...why I checked it out ---very enjoyable and fun to read. Wanterd to finish it to find out the outcome of each person's life. A good read! 5 stars
3,"Good, but not great.","I bought ""The Honk and Holler Opening Soon"" expecting great things. Although it was a GOOD novel, I was a little disappointed. I did not 'laugh out loud' or 'cry with feeling' as the back of the book advised that I would. Again, it was good, but not great. If you want a laugh out loud book, get the Fannie Flagg book: ""Daisy and the Miracle Man."" THAT was an excellent book and that's what I thought ""The Honk and Holler, etc."" would be..."
4,Just a Really Good Book,"I have read Where the Heart Is just like everyone else, and of course just loved it.I was at the library and noticed Honk and Holler and picked it up.It is just such a nice story - good message and a happy ending. I normally ready mystery fiction but every now and then it is nice to take a break and read a book like this."
4,You will Love the Characters in this Book!,"This is the first book I have read by Billie Letts and plan to read more. Soon after starting reading this book, I developed an affection for the owner of The Honk and Holler Opening Soon but wondered if he would continue to be just an observer of life and start participating in it. The characters in this book set in rural Oklahoma are interesting and amusing without being demeaning. Before even getting to the mid-point of the book--I was almost convinced that I had eaten at this diner without noticing all that was happening in the lives of those around me. The ending is not unexpected and welcome. If my dogs hadn't chewed up the last few pages I would be passing on my copy of this book."
1,Audio cassette book,I love this story . I read the book plus later ordered the audio edition The merchandise arrived in a reasonable amount of time but Only the first 3 cassettes played clearly the rest were barely audible
5,Real human life,"I am Japanese. I have read English novel a few times. So, it took long time to read it through, but I did not feel bored. It is because during my reading I was dying to know what happened next. I think it is a real page-turner. Stories go in the food shop, where I felt warm and friendly. If there were such food shop, I would like to go there. Furthermore, I want to try ""Where the heart is."" by Billie Letts."
3,"A good story, but slightly unbelievable for me.","This is the first Billie Letts book I've read -- pretty good but certainly not among those that I can't put down. I had trouble believing and identifying with the characters because of their unusual names and the unusual ethnic representation in the group. Also, I felt like there wasn't much character development; I got more of a feel for the town of Sequoyah than I did for any one character. Overall I'd say it's a pleasant book with a few tense moments."
2,Trite,A long and drawn out story with very underdeveloped characters. This was a lengthy tale of a diner and the people who ate there. I kept hoping and waiting it was going to get better. I expected so much more after Where the Heart Is. I am in awe of how well everyone reviewed it. I thought it lacked the savvy of the first novel and I thought the character names and histories sounded a little too familiar. Reading this book made me feel cheated.
1,major disappointment,"I was expecting a better book than this having read ""Where the heart is"". The characters were so underdeveloped and then details were thrown in about characters that were barely mentioned during the course of the book. This book was a big let down. It was one of those books that you read half way through and just want to stop because it is so unfullfilling. I cannot believe the good ratings this book has received from most people."
4,I think I know this cafe!,"Ms. Letts tells us yet another tale of America. I find myself picturing local cafes that I have been to and thinking I've met these people, they are THAT real! An excellent read, and an inspiration for me to get my journal out and hang out at the cafes and write!"
5,Honk! My Heart is Where Billie Letts is!,"I loved ""Where the Heart is,"" it was an easy read, feel good book.""Honk and Holler"" is repeated proof of Billie Lett's talent. Her characters can make you laugh out loud or silently shed a tear. They are a melting pot of diversitiy, they're you and me.Thank you, Billie Letts! Give us MORE!!!"
4,HAD HIGH HOPES AFTER WHERE THE HEART IS,THE BOOK WAS A FUN READ VERY FAST PACED BUT I NEVER FELT THAT I GOT TO KNOW ANY OF THE CHARACTERS. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE FLESHED OUT CHARACTERS A LITTLE MORE
4,I loved this book.,"I could hardly wait to read this book & was sorry when it ended. It's warm, funny but yet a story where the characters seem to become real & take a life of their own."
2,Okay debut for a band that becomes great,"Listening to this album, one wouldn't think that DCFC would become a band to be succesful but they eventually do. While this album lacks the musicality of later albums, I simply think the growth that occurred during The Postal Service side project led to overall success for this band, everything prior to that for me is subpar and can be skipped."
1,"Overrated, amputated.","I enjoyed this record when I first bought it, I really did. But that enjoyment soured very quickly and I ended up selling the CD. What we have here is paint-by-numbers emo, similar to 764-HERO's fatal misstep, ""Get Here And Stay"". Sure, the performances are pleasant, the songs are unobtrusive but also very predictable with a short shelf life. But isn't that what NW rock is about? Yes, they have more than a little in common with Built To Spill. Yes, you can spot their influences a mile away. The production is the tinniest and shallowest I have heard in a while. Everything about this release seems designed to appeal to the indie-emo kids. Watching these guys twitch and smirk on cue at the Crocodile was beyond embarassing, especially since openers Pedro the Lion blew them off the stage so casually. Suck it up and like it, Seattle!"
1,Seattle's underground belongs in the sewer,"What can one say about Death Cab for Cutie, a band that takes their name from an obscure line in a Beatles movie? What can one say about the boredom I went through listening to the numerous dull tracks, trying to find a silver lining? There are no words to describe it. I bought this at a friend's suggestion, mainly as a favor, as they were friends of his. Needless to say, the two of us are no longer on speaking terms. This cd is a waste of your money. Run away and don't look back."
1,Hype.,"This band played at the Humdinger House. About 30 people were there. The crowd nodded like zombies. The emo jam session was mediocre.Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie.The band stormed the stage with indifference. Ben Gibbard had concrete in his shoes. The emo jam session was dull.Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie.(Two minute keyboard solo)This record has interesting noises. They hide the dull, bloodless songs. The local scene is full of shoegazers. They'll suck this down like a cigar!Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie. Death Cab For Cutie.Rock over London! Rock on Bellingham! What's Up! Bellingham's essential entertainment guide!"
1,A good suicude aid.,"My friend thinks the members of this band are his friends and strongly urged that I buy it. Well let's just say I have recurring dreams about that fateful night. If you're a fan of monotous, boring music, this CD should be yours. The only person that would find this album exciting is Al Gore. There is one good thing about this CD however. Have you ever seen what happens when you put a CD in the microwave? Thanks to this CD my dog can now catch frisbees particularly well."
3,my first dcfc cd... good not great,"Ok this isnt an album that is going to change the world but is really good. If you have never owned a DCFC album before this might not be the best one to start with. Dont get me wrong this is a beautiful album and one that i havent really gotten sick of yet but all the lo-fi make it a chore to listen to at first. Deserves 3.75. The song writing is amazing and the musical arrangements are spectacular. The cello is a nice touch. Extremly great on rainy days. ""Champange from a Paper Cup"", ""Bend to Squares"", ""Pictures in an Exhibit"", and ""Fake Frowns"" are the true gems of this album. Good all the way through but not for everyone. Worth giving a chance and if you do you will probably love this band. Download a song or two before you deciede to buy it but you collection isnt complete with out an album or three by these guys."
4,You gotta see them play.,"I first saw Death Cab last summer at Portland, OR's NXNW music festival. I immediatley made a connection with older Sunny Day Real Estate song writtings. The energy and passion that Death CAB has is electric and energizing in a way that I find captivating. I again saw them at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle and was very happy to find the same passion. I spite of technical difficulties, they rose to the occasion and presented a talented and crisp sounding show without any displays of arrogance or conceit. Get the CD and see them if you can."
5,"Excellent, exciting but with a serious message","Patrick Tilley has created an engagingly well thought out series of sci-fi stories based around a post nuclear war scenario. The characters are well developed (but by book 6 I think Patrick was getting ""lost"" a little) and the story is very fresh.Great fun to read. I read all 6 in 2 months!"
1,Long and dull,"I read the first book; it was reasonable, but that's about all you can say. The second book is worse. I cannot believe that Tilley could spin this tripe out to fill six whole books."
4,Saddle Creek,"This DVD was made well and was very interesting. It was cool to see how the bands formed and reformed and how almost everyone under Saddle Creek is connected. My only complaint is that I wish the DVD would have shown more ""professional"" footages of live performances. I was expecting more music and less talking, but I still enjoyed it."
4,"Good, if a bit lopsided","Of the featured artists I was only really familiar with Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes, Commander Venus, etc.) and Cursive, and I wanted to get the story of the musical scene they came from. Overall I enjoyed this doc, and there were lots of extras, including a particularly energetic live performance by The Faint. My one real problem was that they focused primarily on the bigger bands on the label, and when they got to the ""smaller"" acts they sort of rushed through them, and I would've liked to know more about them."
3,its a Documentary and a documentary only ....,"this being in my first 5 band dvds bought, i was disappointed in that thers hardly ANY actual live footage. In fact, not a single song is seen the whole way through. So, be true fans of the bands, to enjoy !!"
5,Family Fun,This is a great race track game that is fun for the whole family. I would suggest getting 1 or 2 extra cars so that the whole family can play. It's a great way to spend fun time with the kids.
4,Perfect toy for boys,"This is a fabulous toy. We got it for Christmas for two boys, ages 5 and 8. They have played happily with it for hours--no fussing! It comes with armor/covers for the basic black cars--things that older boys might like for changing how they look. Our boys, though, have no use for the armor--they just like the cars going FAST around and around the dome. My 8 year old put the dome together himself, so it isn't hard. For only $15 this is a steal even with having to pay shipping."
4,Buy super glue!!!!!,This track is overall a great set. The only bad problem that I can see is that the track (dome) does not stay together at all. It is always falling apart...
2,wouldn't purchase again,"This was a neat product, but the base was difficult to keep together while playing. My nephews really enjoyed playing it, but were frustrated when the base continued to fall apart.Unfortunately it became one of those gifts that was donated to charity after Christmas!"
2,"FUN , BUT NOT STURDY ENOUGH FOR YOUNG ONES","I bought this product because of the reviews hoping it would be something different for my grandsons 4 & 6. They did like it while we all were with them playing, but it didn't keep them amused very long when they were on there own. They are just starting to play together and maybe they needed to be more competitive for this toy. It really didn't hold up that well. An adult and child toy would better describe it for that age group."
2,Basic Basic Basic,I own a DELL AXIM and it took awhile to configure the buttons to match. Basically I had to do trial and error until the buttons matched with the compaq. Once it got working no problems.Sometimes it freezes your handheld which causes you to reset.Game is just as I remembered. Don't forget we are talking about 80's so don't expect great graphics. But if you have 5 minutes to kill its an ok game. I hope they bring out better arcade games than this in the future.
1,Commando needs more,"This game was rereleased finally after being for the original Nes. Now Capcam makes it playable only for the stupid PDA system. Not one of the new game systems like PS2, or the PC. What the hell were they thinking?"
2,Finland.. where is the love?,"Although this book clearly depicts finland and it's openness, and freedom, I felt it didn't truely capture what i love so much about it.That is it's warmth, and love, that is all this book was missing."
5,THIS TOY RULES!!,Voice FX Duke is the best GI Joe toy ever! He comes with ALOT of accessories and talks loudly and clearly. With his loud voice and lots of gear (three of them with launching missles) this could be the loved toy of every kid. I know I love it.
5,Awesome!,"I was skeptical of getting another toy with a bunch of little parts but this toy is so much better than other toys like this. The main man is real big and his guns and accessories are big, too. Parts are easy to hold and find, not cheap bendable plastic. There is even an extra man of a smaller size. The larger one talks when you push his stomach and yells when you push harder. It's great! I can't believe it was only $5.29! Definatley worth a lot more. It's perfect for my boys' first GI Joe."
3,Dark Funeral DVD,"This is a fun watch. Surprisingly good quality video, lots of blast-from-the-past live footage, and amazingly tight performances. If not for the lack of between-song banter and up-close-and-personal interviews, I would rate this a 5."
5,True Hag,"Falls a bit short of his great albums like ""Kern River"" and ""Thats the way love goes"", but I still wouldn't lisson to anything else."
4,"Good, gritty Haggard","Some very good, strong Haggard esp. the title song, The Garbage Man, Ten Feet Tall and That's The News. Re the last one: what's the point? the banality of war? A curious song from the man identified with Fightin' Side of Me-style, pro-US songs."
3,No five stars for Hag?,"I'm sorry. I love Merle Haggard's stuff more than just about anybody's, but ""Haggard Like Never Before"" just doen't fire my rocket. It's like there's a level of melancholy here that just won't let up and maybe hints that we've just about seen the last we're gonna see from this great man. I'm not saying this album is not worth listening to - it is Merle Haggard - I'm just saying this is nowhere near his best."
4,good noisy shaver,I'm using this for about four months so I may be a good judge.It gives a very close shave something like a razor.I have a lot of facial hairs which grow wildly in different directions speciallyon my neck so shaving is always a difficult thing for me.Although this machine gives a close shave but it's not a major advantage overmy old cheap rotary shaver which I was using for 10 years without any maintenance.I had and still have problem with very inclined hairs on my neck.The cleaning dock is a very lovely noisy thing.It feels very nice when your shaver smells new everyday.
3,Good product bad feature.,"This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It forms to your face very nicely. It takes a few passes to get all the hair off, but it does get it all. The only draw back to this device is the lock feature on it. After a few weeks of using the product it completely broke off. It is only held on by a small peace of plastic. Which will break very easily if you actually use the lock feature, and to get the hair under your nose and above your lip, you really need to use it. Well it broke within a few weeks of using it. If this one thing would be fixed it would be the perfect electric shaver. So now I am returning it to the Bruan company and looking for a different one."
4,Awesome shaver.,"I was sad when my old Braun from 1997 finally died recently, and I had to find a replacement. After much research, I went with this one, and I LOVE IT. I have to guard it from my wife, who really wants to use it shave her legs, but will keep it from her as long as possible! Buy this if you want a product with a long battery life (twice daily shaving for a week, in between charges), and a fantastic shave every time. The clippers also work great for sideburns. It's a one-stop-shop shaver."
3,Worst shopping experience at Amazon.com,"I have ordered Braun Series 7- 760cc shaver at Amazon.com on June 23rd, and the Estimated shipping they have given me is June 29th. And the Worst thing about it is you are receiving the item only after July 6th or even later. I have never had such a bad experience with any other online shopping site. So, if you plan to order something through Supersaver shipping at Amazon.com, and you need it in within 10 days at the max., just forget it, or try through some other site. Horrible experience."
1,Snags facial hair after 2 years of Use,My old Braun shaver worked great. When the old one burned out after 10 years I decided to upgrade. To my disappointment the new foil design constantly snags my facial hair and has never given me as close of a have as the old model. I am very disappointed.
3,Meh,"So far (about a month), I'm not seeing it meet its advertised claims. It does a decent job above the chinline, but below the chinline I can't seem to get it to do a good job. It consistently misses even longer whiskers below the chinline. I previously had used a Norelco ""lift & cut"" type electric shaver, which wasn't so great either, but it seemed to be more consistent. I'm still experimenting with this one to see if I can get it to work better, but I'm beginning to wonder if it will..."
4,Braun Pulsonic System 9585,"A good razor, if a bit noisy. Be ready to hear it when you hit the clean button! It is really nice to have the cleaning station though.It shaves beard hairs as close as my older rotary shaver. But it does feel much smoother on the skin than the older rotaries. Also, the head does not heat up nearly as much while shaving.It is a great gadget, but the price tag at twice as much as other shavers does not mean twice as good. However, I don't miss cleaning the old rotary shaver, and that is worth something too."
3,Braun Pulsonic Razor,"The Braun Pulsonic is comfortable to use. Don't expect a closer shave than less expensive models from Braun and other manufacturers. I was hoping for a lot more from the Pulsonic razor. That said now that I own it I will use it until an electric razor comes out that can actually give us a close and comfortable shave like a blade can. If that day comes the Pulsonic will become a paperweight, a rather expensive one at that."
2,just ok,"I have been using Braun for over 25 years, in short this razor is below par of other Brauns of the past. As far as closeness of a shave its ok, For neck hairs you will have to park it there for a while, back and forth. My biggest complaint is when shaving around my goatee, the shaver will pull and pinch goatee hairs, sort of a pain. For the price it should be better than just OK."
3,okay shaver,"The Braun Series 7 with pulsonic head is described in reviews as being a great break through in electric shavers. It does not shave as close as my old Remington shaver. On the positive side, the battery holds up very well and the trimmer works well. Unfortunately, I would have to say it is not worth the $200+ I paid for it."
5,"Best shaver, hands down","I have never had such a close shave, so quickly. Within 2 or 3 shaves, my face was used to this phenomenal razor and the shaves have been nearly perfect since. It gets a very close shave, without having to labor over the same spots over and over again. It also is easy to handle, and cleans easily. Great product and worth the money, even if it does seem a bit high."
2,Braun: Low Quality - Bad Shave - Two Years of Experience with this product,"This was my first electric razor - having only used straight razors and disposable razors in the past. I have had this product for two in a half years. I use it occasionally - leaving it my car for emergency on the road shaves.Considering that this units trimmer has completely broken off and that it takes me five-ten minutes to get a clean shaven look,I have decided to give this product two stars.As for the self-clean unit this shaver comes with, it would only work on its highest setting - never on the eco setting. This meant that I was out of solution in just two months. Needless to say I opted to clean the unit myself. I have used my dads older units in the past and can say that this unit is no better than his - the only difference is that while his blades are ten years old mine are only 2 years old.Frankly I am shocked this razor is still getting high marks - its quality is seriously lacking."
1,A Bad Deal!,This thing is super expensive and one might think after all the expense that they wouldn't have to shell out more money but leave it to Proctor & Gamble- Braun's Owner- to find ways to milk you for money!First you have to buy the cleaning trays which last only a month and will run you about $60 per year. Then you need a new shaving block after a year and a half which is another $50. And after shelling out all this money you will have a shaver that takes twice as long as a manual and will never shave as close or as well.
5,good shaver,"My husband only likes BRAUN shavers, uses them for many years now. Bought him a new one recently and he is happy with this one , too"
3,"Not bad, but not impressed.","I've had this for a few years now. For the price when I bought it, I expected more.One negative about this razor is that it self-cleans, but it leaves colored cleaning fluid on the razer that gets on my skin when I shave in the morning. So I have to wipe it off each morning before I use it.Next negative--it cuts OK, but for the advanced technology I'm supposedly paying for, it doesn't cut well enough or close enough, even with the new blades I recently bought.Next negative--replacement cleaning fluids have to be replaced about once a month, and they aren't cheap--around $12 for 2. Multiply this times the life of the razor, and you get a decent income stream to the manufacturer.Positive--well, it holds a charge pretty long. Controls are straightforward. And it does cut."
5,Excellent shaver -- no real complaints!,"Length:: 9:38 MinsHello everyone. This is a 9 minute and 37 second clip of my review and opinion on the Braun 760cc electric shaver.I cover several aspects on ease of use, items it comes with, features I like, and any problems I have with the shaver.I, at the time of making/publishing this video, am just getting over a cold so have a little bit of sniffles -- for this, my apologies.I hope this video gives you some insight and useful information, and opinion, on this shaver."
2,Too much money for too little performance!,"Although this razor promises all sorts of results, my husband hates it and spends more time going over, and over, and over the same spots to get it to cut, especially on the neck area. Not impressed at all and should have done way more research BEFORE buying. Too bad there is no return policy on this horrible razor as we are stuck with this expensive mistake!"
3,shave closeness,Shaver does not shave as close as I expected.I have to go over areas of my face several times and press very hard for a smooth shave.the best feature is that it does not irritate the skin.
4,Better than most razors but still not perfect,"This razor is really cool and is so simple to use. It works great and provides a very close shave to ALMOST every part of your face. There are still some issues with getting on the neck in those hard to reach areas. You have to be careful or you end up rubbing your neck raw and that looks worse than if you missed a spot. All in all, a great razor and much easier and faster than a regular razor. 4 out of 5."
1,Not to good on my neck,"After two months the product still doesn't work well on my neck; it leaves fairly substantial stubble. Overall this product gives a less close shave than my razor. I wanted a more environmentally green product than my disposable razor and shaving cream, but this isn't it. Lots more waste in the form of disposable packaging for the cleaning solution. The unit uses one of these a month and Braun doesn't have a refill kit for the solution. For $230 I expect to be smoother than a baby's rear end."
2,Change is not always a good thing!,"I have been a fan of Braun shavers for many many years when I decided to upgrade to the 760 series. I found the floating heads do not shave close under my chin and upper lip. The 760 is very comfortable to use, but lacks the close, clean shave of previous models. The pop-up trimmer is not nearly as functional as on earlier models. I have sent the 760 back to Braun for a refund as they offer a 60 day money back guarantee."
4,A-,This shaver is the most comfortable shave I have had from an electric. What it does shave is very close for an electric shaver also. However I still find that it misses about 5% of my beard mostly on my neck. Now I have not used it the entire 3 weeks yet that they recommend so I'm still waiting to see if it improves.At the moment though I am a little disappointed after reading such good reviews. Overall I think it is a good shaver but it is not perfect.
2,cleaning base is bad,"Since i've bought the shaver ,the plastic cleaning base doesnt work well. Always lost contact with the shaver inside,loosing all the cleaning process...too bad!!"
3,Silver paint burning and chipping off near the swivel head.,"I've had my Braun 9585 (760cc) for a little over 16 months, and recently I noticed that the silver paint is coming off in small pieces near the swivel head revealing a large black plastic area where the large ""CAUTION"" lettering appears. I believe this is as a result of the head-end being subjected to elevated temperatures during the cleaning process. Unfortunately these small silver pieces migrate into the swivel head area and the cleaning bowl, requiring manual removal.Fortunately the limited warranty is for 24 months, so I will now contact Braun and file my complaint.Aside from the above problem, I like the shaver."
5,Braun series 7 shaver,I have used many different electric shavers and this one is by far the best. It provides a nice clean shave and the cleaning system is great.
5,Braun Pulsonic outstanding product,My husband says that it is the best shaver he has ever had. It shaves close and comfortably.
4,Braun Pulsonic Shaver,"The Braun Pulsonic does an excellent job of giving me a close, comfortable shave, even with several days growth. I am surprised that the company provided a cheesy plastic travel case for a shaver that cost over $200. Looks like they could provide a higher quality case."
1,something wrong,I am uncomfortable with the reality of this advertisement. Its sounds off with phony brouhaha...The speaker attempts to be authentic but fails with such a corny performance.I would never buy anything from this unbelievable pretender.
2,Great for 3 mos then BROKEN,I had this for 3 months so far and it worked great with a clean shave for 2 months. I would have given this a 5 star at the time.It stopped working after 2.5 months...emailled into Braun for warranty and got a response 1 week later telling me they make quality products and I can bring this to a service center or ship it at my expense for repair. I also could have returned it within 60 days for money back.I did not find Braun's policy acceptable and would expect them to replace this at THEIR expense after 3 months of use and paying over $200 on Amazon.
1,NO GOOD,I have been a long time customer of Braun Shavers and when I updated the the 760 I was greatly disappointed with the shave it provides.I took it to the service center after a week or two and they replaced the head.The problem was that it was pulling hairs rather than cutting and not giving a close shave.The new head was better but still does not provide what was advertised and still pulls hair.My face looks like I have been using a blade razor.And the worst part is that after all of the pulling it still does not give a good shave.Really surprised!!!
2,disappointed,Just bought the Braun 760 model and am very disappointed. It is not one bit better than my 6 year old $60. Norelco. It may be the closest thing to a razor but still not even close.
5,braun series 7-760,Pruchases this item for my husband two years ago; purchsed it for my son this year. It is by far the best electric shaver. The refils are a pest but the close shave is great!
3,Average,They say that this is the closest you can get to a razor blade. Its not that close. Blades dull after 2 weeks of use...
3,still uncertain,"i have been using this shaver since early january 2010 and i want to say it does a good job on my face, but it seems to have a hard time removing the hairs from my neck. i am older, so maybe the looseness of my skin under my neck causes this issue. for the price, i would have expected better results, but i will continue to put the shaver through its paces to see if it gets any better. if not, i'll give it to my 15 year old grandson and go back to my 30 year old norelco rotary shaver with the original blades."
1,Hoaxed,"Not certain who wrote this, but he should know that Butch is not the DA of New York City but of Manhattan and that Father Mike is not a simple parish priest but a cashiered Jesuit.There are other equally terrible errors."
1,Reconciliation ??,"As other reviewers have picked up on, Hoax is not close to the standards Tanenbaum and Gruber set for most of the other novels. The characters are wooden and the great dialog which both defined the characters and drove the plots of the previous novels, is seriously lacking. Pages and pages of philosophical ruminations . . . Ugh!! The lowlite is the cliff scene where Lucy is rescued at the last second by Hopalong Cassidy --- I laughed out loud. Having read Gruber's first book under his own name, and been happy with his writing but less than enamored with the plotting, I would hope these two get back together. Like many duos, they're much better than the sum of their parts."
4,Needs more editing,"I love Butch and Marlene and find the descriptions of their personal struggles beneficial. I also marvel that things written in this story could indeed depict true life. However, I was disappointed in several misspellings and a BIG mistake. The children weren't eaten by bears because they made fun of Job--wrong Biblical character. Tanenbaum's editors let him down especially in light of all the religious interweavings of this story. I did like the book though."
5,One of the best,"I was a bit surprised by the ratings I saw, 1 and 2 stars? To me, this one was the best in a long time, made me look forward to the next one. Marlene wasn't as unbelievable as in the recent past, Butch was, well Butch. So if you are a fan of the series and have not purchased this one yet, you really should. If some of the negative reviews scare you, go to the library and check it out"
1,Groan,"Michael Gruber's genius is sorely missed.I've read every one of the books in this series, but this is the last one unless I see an acknowledgment to Mr. Gruber in the next one.Memo to Mr. Tanenbaum: Too many sentences starting with ""However"". That's a stylistic no-no. Too many characters purring, pouting, lamenting, sulking, growling, hissing, grousing, grumping, sniffing their words. Just have them say or ask the dialog. Too many chortles. One does not ""pour"" over maps. It's a murder of _crows_, not cows. Here's Guma after someone insults him: ""'Hey, I resemble that,' Guma lamented."" Way lame.The characters aren't even in character in this book. They just aren't the same people.The hoax may be on us. Some of us got conned into buying this book. If this had been the first one in the series, I would never have bought the second."
3,A Sad Disappointment,"I have been a huge fan of the Butch Karp - Marlene Ciampi series. I've read every novel more than once. So I happily paid top dollar for a hard cover for a book I assumed I would thoroughly enjoy. I was sadly disappointed.Tanenbaum forgets crucial details about his returning characters. (Where is Lucy's deep religious faith?) His new characters are caricatures (shy cowboy, fiendish serial killer, corrupt priest). He makes errors of fact. (Sarah, not Rachel, was Abraham's wife.) He tells far too much of the story in flashbacks. It slows the pace and weakens the suspense.Earlier reader reviews mention the absence of co-writer Michael Gruber. I conclude it's Mr. Gruber, not Mr. Tanenbaum, who gave the series its power. I'm not plunking down $26 again without checking the credits carefully."
2,Aptly Titled,"I did not know anything about Tanenbaum using a ghost writer until I read the reviews on this site. I read ""Reversible Error"" about ten years ago, but nothing else credited to Tanenbaum. I am only halfway through this and scratching my head as to why there is no cohesion to this novel. I don't think I've ever read anything so full of meandering fluff as this book! I gave it two stars only because there have been a few chapters that have held my interest fairly well, although they eventually get lost in the haze that appears to comprise much of this story. It's also loaded with very awkwardly constructed sentences. How did it slip by the editor?"
1,Thank you all for the explaination,"I'm half way through the book, couldn't take it any more, so jumped on the internet to see if I could find out what's going on. Thanks for the heads-up about the probable ghost writer for the earlier Butch Karp novels. I considered the series some of the best of popular fiction. This nose dive into plodding self importance is astonishing.I was thinking Haox is something like a 600 page comic book but that really isn't fair to comic books."
4,"An enjoyable read, perfect for summer","This was my second Tannenbaum novel (Resolved was the first) and I enjoyed it more for a number of reasons. It continues the saga of the Karp/Ciampi family and adds depth to the characters fans have come to know and care about. It also brings in real world controversy, including corruption within the Church and a fiendish priest who believes his religious duty is to molest then kill young boys. This is one of the longer books of the series (almost 500 pages). Although the story line jumps back and forth between New York City and Taos, New Mexico, following along is relatively easy. Everything is tied up neatly in the last 60 pages which some might argue is too pat. Hence, the four stars. For those who don't mind the quick plot resolution, add a star. Overall, it's a fun summer read that will involve readers throughout."
2,A letdown after previous novels,"What happened to Tanenbaum's writing ability? The plot is OK, but the characters seem stiff and unreal compared with previous novels about the same people. Worst of all, sentences are clumsy. If this were a first novel, I don't think it would have been published.Maybe an editor quit, or a co-author? Something happened. Hope it gets fixed if Tanenbaum keeps writing."
1,GET MICHAEL GRUBER BACK!,"What ever it takes! GET MICHAEL GRUBER BACK! Marlene, Tran, etc. put all your resources into getting Mr. Gruber back! I've read every other Karp book & love them. Hoax made me sad, I hate to loose this wonderful series. The characters, main & new, are not alive in Hoax. The usual authenticity is gone as well; I worked with gang members for years and found the portrayal of bangers a laughable, insulting stereotype. Please stop describing people as ""well knit"", you used the term 3 times, that I noticed, in this book (Usually you've used only once in pervious books)This is the only time a Karp novel has bored me. It got better at the end but I don't know if it was worth reading to get there & even then parts were trite & ho hum"
1,Now I Know What the Hoax Is - Money Back Please!!!,"How stupid does Tanenbaum think his readers are?? This series used to be one of the most sophisticated, character-driven, plot-rich series around, with sidebars of brainy, funny riffs on the nature of urban, rainbow living in NYC, insane bureaucracies and the compromise necessary to applying the law. Even when the coincidences piled on too deep, you didn't care because the writing was so good and the characters so compelling. The only exceptions were the times Gruber wasn't acknowledged in the front of the book.Now it's just one more cardboard character, idiotically plotted, oh-so-boring wastes of time. It killed any interest in Butch, Marlene, and all the rest. Shame on Tanenbaum! Shame on the greedy publisher and duped editor! Shame on the advance reviewers,who were totally asleep at the switch! Tanenbaum, get Gruber back or retire!"
1,I just wanted to add my 1-star review to the list,I can't add anything that hasn't already been said about this shamefully bad book. I was terribly disappointed.
2,Hoax,"I agree with the reviewers who say this book was, well, a, hoax!! This is not the same writer, and not the same family I've enjoyed through the years. I've read every one of the Butch Karp books and never been disappointed until now. The writer romanticised the Taos area and naively portrayed the Taos Indians, Hispanics,and ""anglos."" There was very little of the usual action, and much dissertation about the American Southwest (inaccurate and naive, as I mentioned above), so that the story could have been written in 1/3 of the pages present.The family characters weren't nearly as piquant or alive as usual, and really behaved in ways that aren't consistent with any of the other books.I don't intend to read another by this ""author."""
1,Who is the real author?,"I don't know who wrote this, but it couldn't have been the Robert Tanenbaum I've followed loyally for years. Previous novels in this series have exhibited an enchanting metamorphosis for the Karp/Ciampi clan. The entire writing style is completely different. I have no words to express my disappointment.Will the real author please stand up?"
1,A great disappointment,"What a stinker... As a great fan of the Karp/Ciampi partnership, I am horrified to admit that I read this tepid installment. The story is largely told retrospectively, with a plot point revealed then a long and tedious explanation as to how it all happened, and a good quarter of the book is taken up by rehashing ancient history. The villains are straight out of a comic book and should have had blood dripping from fangs and horns growing from their heads to complete the picture. The dialogue is weak, the plot ludicrous (the long-suffering Lucy is lassooed in mid-cliff-plunge by a cowboy!!) and on a completely different note, the sub-editor should be shot - a murder of cows????? Please - that's the sloppiest typo I've seen in years. The whole mess reads like it was constructed from old bits of paper swept up by Tanenbaum's housekeeper from under his desk. Kill 'em all off, please!"
5,"good mp3 player, good battery life, EVEN SUPPORT UDF format CD","when I use this cd player to test the cd formatted using nero Incd to make it work like a flash memory I didn't expect it to work since this player is so cheap, but to my surprise it worked just like normal cd. That means I can use it to play cds that can write and erase like the flash memory. I highly recommend it to those who wants to use it to play cd in UDF format."
3,Work fine WITHOUT remote,"The CD Player work fine, have a great sound. The Anti Skip works good. But It NOT have a remote. The package only have a manual, a earphones and the player.It's a great item and a good price but it comes incomplete."
2,Moderately Dissappointed,"Moderately DissappointedThe peak volume is low. You can shuffle with albums on an MP3 disc. Has no radio. Has a sucky bass boost. No remote. Good battery life. Small display. Tacky feel.I'm getting the D-NF420PSBLUE. Although it's twice the price, it's a hundred times better. Even allows ATRAC format.As for this, I'm putting a Hilary Duff CD in it and lighting it on fire. Hallelujah."
1,Too much detail,"I personally thought that Gary Paulsen wrote too much detail in this book. For example, there were two pages of how Brian skinned the deer. Also, there was an ubrupt ending. He heard a shot, found where it came from, and was saved. One page. I would recomend a lot of his other books. Those were phenominal, but this one, I would stay away from.:( :( :("
3,I Hated it,I didn't like it because there was a lot of killimg involved and the authour described it very dramatically. Some parts of the book were just plain boring and it didn't lead to anything. I would not reccomend this book.
1,If you like books that repeat over and over..,"This book is the most boring thing I have ever read in my entire life, Seriously!I would even rather read 'Barney goes to the Zoo'..At least in this book he dosen't obsess over 'the Secret' that muchBy the way, the secret is LAME-O. Not worth your time.Trust me, read something better.Like 'The Constant Princess' for instance?"
4,Brian's Winter,"Gary Paulsen's book Brian's Winter is the story of what would have happened had Brian not been rescued as he was in his first book Hatchet. I enjoyed this sequel very much and couldn't put it down after I picked it up. The only reason I give this book 4 out of 5 stars is because of what I feel was an anticlimactic ending. This is a perfect book for a rainy weekend when you have nothing to do. I recommend that before reading Brian's Winter that you read Hatchet since it is referred to often and you may miss a few points if you don`t. This is a good book for readers who enjoy nature, but keep in mind that sometimes nature can be gory. This is a very good book and I highly recommend it."
3,My first Paulsen book!,"Gary Paulsen writes for young adults and teenagers. He got published long after I graduated high school. Anyway, this book is the story of Brian who must survive and endure the hardships of life in the Canadian wilderness. Paulsen is quite detailed in explaining his survival but it gets tedious at times and repetitive. It's a good book for young kids, boys and girls. Brian's story of survival is quite like Castaway for kids but only the winter wilderness of Canada rather than an island in the Pacific. The book is an easy read but I didn't like the parts about Brian killing the animals like rabbits since I'm a rabbit lover as well as moose and others."
4,Brains Winter,My revew for this story is that I think that it is a very exciting book it was full of chanlengles and is full of adventure. I liked how he prepared for the winter and all the challenges he has to over come to make the objects that he has to to survive the harsh winter. So read this book to find out what happens to Brain and see if he makes it or how he maneges to survive.
5,A Cool Book,"A neat book I read is called ""Brian's Winter"". It is about a boy named Brian who is on a plane that chrashes. Brian is all alone. What I like about this book isthat Brian has to learn to survive the cold Northern winter. Brian also needs to make bows, arrows, and a war lance to survive. This book is one of my favroite books, and I bet you would like it to."
2,Brains Winter: a review,"Gary paulson is the writer of many good books. This I feel is not one. While the adventure is good, and the ways he survives is dumbfounding, everything is very scripted. When he is abouyt to starve, he finds food. When you begin this book, dont expect him to die. It is after all a childrens book. But when I picked it up and looked at the cover and saw some reviews, I expected a little more from the award winning Paulson."
3,It was OK,I recently read Brian's Winter. I liked it very much. I thought it was a very interesting book. I especially liked the part when Brian almost didn't get rescued.
5,The Many Sacrifices of Living in the Wild,"This book is so cool; it has lots of adventures and action. It is filled with animals. It is a great guide on living in the wild. Once you start reading this book you can't put it down. I enjoyed this book a lot because it reminds me so much of me and what I would do if I was I was in the wilderness all alone, and the author made it seem so real and wrote it so great. This is the best book ever it will make you feel so wild and ready to go and hunt or something. Please read this book it so awesome get it pass it on and make them pass it on it is the best!!!"
5,Brian's Winter,"I think Brian's Winter is a five star book because it was very interesting. Brian makes his own snow shoes! He kills a moose with a lance! Also, Brian makes a bow and arrow. See, Brian's Winter is an awesome book. It kept me reading!"
4,Brian's winter,"A decent alternative sequel to Hatchet. No surprises--if you like the other Brian books, you will like this one too."
4,Review of the book I read!!,Brian's Winter was the best book I have read in a long time. I thought it was really cool and a had lot of action and keeps you wondering about it and whats going to happen. It had me liking the book at the very beginng. I like all of Gary Paulson books and this was my favorite one out of all of them. I would tell others to read it and I would read it 3 more times.
5,Read Hatchet first,Excellent sequel to Hatchet. The book was written for teens and pre-teens but it was a good informative read for an old dog like me. I highly recommend it.
4,Awesome Book!,"I think that Brian's Winter is an interesting story. The author is Gary Paulsen who has written many great books. Brian's Winter is the third book after Hatchet. The book ""The River"" comes after Hatchet. Brian's Winter tells about what would have happened if Brian didn't get rescued out of the Canadian forests when he did and how he had to go through a strong and cold Canadian winter without and supplies besides the stuff he rescued from the plane. I liked this book because it tells about an interesting story of a boy on his own stranded away from home in a forest. Brian's Winter is just one of the five books of a series and I think you should definitely read it!"
3,pretty good but stick with Hatchet,i thought brians winter was an okay book...but hatchet was much better. B.W. was kind of predictable and the ending was horrible! I think paulsen could of thought up a much more exciting ending if he really wanted to. Altogether the book was alright but it was no Hatchet.
4,A good wilderness book,I think that this book was agreat adventures book because it tells how a 13 year old kid lived in the cold winter woods of Canada for over a year without dieing. Also Brian is very brave from my point of view because not at any time in the book did he complain about how much he missed his mom and dad. Also Brian learned some very important things like to stay in school because if he would have never gone to home economics he would have never learned how to make his jacket. He would have surly have froze to death. I would reccomend this book because it is a good adventure book but at the beggining it is kind of confusisng other wise it was great.
1,SNORE! SNORE!,"This was the MOST BORING book I have ever read! I'd say the story line was lame, but what story line?? I have nothing against survival stories, but this one STINKS! Now I have to read Popcorn Days and Buttermilk Nights for school and I groaned when I heard and am DREADING IT! I'll let you know if it turns out any better, but I'm not holding my breath. P.S. This is from a girl's perspective so maybe I just don't get it!"
1,Boring,This was really boring we read this book with our class and man all the boys fell asleep. If you are a boy do not read this book because it is way way boring!
3,Brian's Winter,"This was a great book, if you read ""Hatchet"" I suggest you read this book. ""Brian's Winter"" continues from where ""hatchet"" left off, but only Brian, the main character, never got rescued. He has to live in the wilderness, and survive the harsh oncoming winter. Like most books, the sequel is not as good as the original, but it still excellent. Gary Paulsen is a great writer, he expresses his ideas so well, that it feels as though you are the character. I give ""Brian's Winter"" two thumbs up."
4,Brain's Winter,"I rate Brian's Winter an overall 4 because while the book was very good, I feel that it has some problems. Brain's Winter presents an inteesting story, asking the question, ""What would have happened if Brain hadn't been rescued?"" In Brain's Winter, Brain wasn't rescued and he had to survive the greatest trial in nature: winter. Though the book is great, I am vexed by a few problems. First of all, (Don't read this if you hadn't read the book), I can't really understand why that trapper family kept to themselves. Also, Brian seems so accustumed to killing and skinning his prey that it doesn't seem to befit his age. I mean, I'm thriteen and it'd take some time for me to get used to killing and skinning a deer. Despite it's faults though, Brian's Winter is still a great book."
5,Brians Winter,"Brian's Winter is a book leading off of Gary Paulsen's Hatchet, if rescued in the summer but had to survive the winter. Brian's was stranded in a plane crash. He has to learn how to survive in the harsh conditions during the winter season. A part in the book that I found neat was when he lives of a deer carcass for a couple months. Then he takes the deer fat and boils it and makes a stew and eats it just before he goes to sleep. He makes friends with a skunk and gets attacked by a bear. This book will take you on a good wholesome adventure. This book is a really good book because it goes in depth of how he builds a shelter, cooks food, makes clothes, and survive the winter season."
2,Not one of Paulsen's best books,"This was a good sequal book to ""Hatchet"" though I though that it was too perdictable. I mean that in the end you knew that Brain was to be saved. Also Brain remembered Everything he saw about survival and off TV. But it was exciting in parts. But that bear could and can hurt Brain a bit more than it did. Why couldn't Brain come down w/ the flu or something? He didn't even have a headach for that matter. Not one of the best I've ever read."
3,Too Predictable,"After reading ""Hatchet"" anyone can say that this book is too predictable.I don't know why Paulsen had to write a sequel.The Hatchet story was a done deal.I have to admit that the story had a great storyline and plot but it still needs a lot of editing.Like many other reviewers said,I think it's too short.Given a choice,I would choose hatchet instead of this cheap sequel.I was definatly ripped off."
4,"Very good, but too short for my tastes.","This book was well written and fun to read. However, I think that some of the books that Paulsen wrote are too short: I read this one in a few hours. It makes survival stories more interesting if there is more detail, and a longer plot."
5,Brians Winter,"The setting is before winter in Canada and it`s cold. He is flying over the park and it crashes. All he has to survive with is a hatchet, bow and arrows, a shot gun and a few shot gun shells. He has to try and survive the dangerous winter and really dangerous predators, hunt for food, and try to some how figure out how to get home. While trying to survive he finds a skunk has it for a pet and names it Betty.FInally still in Canada he mets these people and brings him to live with them.Ian Matchett"
4,Brian's winter,This is a very interesting book it is action packed and contains many lessons about the daily life of how to survive when being isolated from the world in extreme conditions.
3,Not as exciting as Hatchet,My 10 year old son is reading Brian's Winter after reading Hatchet and thinks that Hatchet had more excitement. He says that Brian's Winter is kind of slow.
4,"Lost in the Woods, a Tale of Survival","I like this book because it is about a boy that needs to survive all by himself. This book has a lot of excitement in it, for example Brian got hit by a moose, and guess what? He managed to kill the moose and take it back to his camp site. If you like adventurous books and think this sounds exciting, read this book.I didn't like to read, but after I read this book, it really made me love it."
4,Brian's Winter,This was a great book. I loved that we were able to find out about Brian after the summer. Gary Paulsen responded well to his readers comments.
5,Amazingly awesome,I think it was really good but he should of mentioned more stuff about the Cree people and if they helped him at all what we're all the names of the people . But over all I am a big dais work and I think it was really awesome.
4,It was well worth the effort of reading this book.,I wondered how might write it or end it but it was all well laid out. I would recommend it.
2,Brian's stupid winter,"This book Is the sequal to Hatchet (Which was a fairly good book) but it can't hold a match to Hatchet, even though Hatchet wasen't a great book! This book (if you can call it that) is a bore."
4,Survivor!,"This is a good book. Brian crash-landed in a forest.Brian tries to survive in this life and death challenge. He has a shotgun, knife, two bows, and a hatchet.This would be for people who like adveturis and survival books. I liked it because he must survive in the wilderness. It is tough. He finds a pet skunk and names it Betty."
5,The outstanding book Brian Winter,"The author of my book is Gary Paulsen.The sequel to this book is the Hatchet.This story is set in the Candian wilderness.Brian Robeson a little boy was going to his dads in the Canadian oil field riding in a plane. It ran out of gas and crashed.If you want to know the rest of the book ""Read It."
4,Good Book,"Before I start I need to tell you that you can't read this book with out reading the book Hatchet. This book is mainly about how he had to crash land in the wilderness in the first book and, in this book is mainly about if he didn't get rescued and was left in the wilderness through the winter. I would recomend this book to any one who had a interest in Hatchet. I do think this book was almost as good as hatchet."
5,Brians winter,"The book Brian&#65533;s winter is written by Gary Paulsen. The main character in the book is Brian Robeson who is a 13-year-old boy that is going to see his father when the plane crashed. Now Brian is stuck in the woods for summer through winter. Brian has to find food to eat by hunting animals like moose, rabbit, and deer to stay alive. Brian has to build shelter, and make his own fire.I like this book because of all the survival tips it gives you. If I was stuck in the woods, I would not know what to do but after reading Brain&#65533;s winter I now can survive in the woods. The boy is only 13-years-old he knew how to survive on his own, he must have been smart. Brian dose not know that winter is comeing so he has to prepare heI give the book a rating of 9 because in the beginning of the book I was confused on what has happened in the first couple pages. At the end the book got a 10 because it got more interesting to me. The book is Realistic fiction. It is a good book so read it."
4,A boy having to survive in the woods by himself.,Brian's Winter is a very good book. It is about a boy who got in a plane crash and had to survive in the wilderness. It had a lot of action and suspense. It had a surprising end to it. If you want to know what happens read it!
4,Great book to show that 13 yr olds can survive on their own!,"I read this book and I thought it was good to know that as a 13 year old I could also survive something that defestasting just like Brian did. Also it showed that by staying in school that you will be able to use information that you have learned to solve new problems. For example, Brian had to make a fire and by remembering something that he learned in science he was able to make that fire. If he didn't know how to make that fire he would surely have died. I think that this is a great book to read but it is also a little confusing on the first three pages, but once you get into it, it get's better."
3,Very Gory!,"Brian's Winter was very gory. If you've already read Hatchet, it's just another ending telling what would've happened if at the end of Hatchet, Brian hadn't been rescued."
4,Gary Paulsen has made another masterpiece!!!,"I love this book, I practicaly know it by heart. people who hasn't read the Hatchet I suggest that you read that first or this book means nothing to you. I gave it a four star rating because their wasn't any excite ment because Brian knew everything and knew what to do. It doesn't give a thrilling excitement."
4,Not as good as the first,"I think the main reason this book isn't as good as the first book, Hatchet, is that the reasoning isn't clear. Paulsen assumes that his reader has read the first book and doesn't readdress Brian's struggle with his parent's divorce.Despite this however, it's a fun book for any kids interested in the wild. Gary Paulsen is a master of telling great adventures; kids will be captivated at how Brian manages to save himself in the harshest of months, with nothing but a few camp supplies. Kids will definitely marvel at his survival skills."
1,The most boring winter,Brian's Winter was boring because nothing exciting happened. Not enough of it is truly exciting. Hatchet is 5 stars compared to Brian's Winter. There is truly nothing interesting in Brian's Winter no tragedies like the tornadoe in Hatchet. I like Gary Paulsen's books but this one is one of his worst.
4,Good book,"My son has enjoyed the other books before this one, and also the alternative ending books."
4,My review,"Brian's Winter is a good book and it deserves 4 stars. Brian didn't seem that exciting at first,but I got excited as I went .You should read Brian's Winter it gives you idea about the wilderness. Brian's Winter is NOT my favorite book. On a scale from one to ten I would give it a 5. If you ever have to have a school assignment and you have to read a book pick Brian's Winter. When Brian gave up looking for food is what made me mad. I thought that he would keep going and would find it no matter what. When I read brian's Winter in book club I thought that it was going to be boring . I don't like the wilderness but I thought it was quite interesting. They should have a movie, because if the book was good the movie would probably be excellent. I would give the movie probably five stars. If there was a movie.IT""S AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good Book!,"Imagine you had to survive in the freezing cold temperatures of Northern Canada. So cold that when you spit, your saliva froze before it hit the ground. This is what Brian Robeson had to do, in the novel Brian's Winter. Brian is the same 13 years old protagonist who remained in the wilderness. This is the second sequel to Hatchet. He is still located in a coniferous forest, where he crashed, in Hatchet. The most important conflict of this book is for him to stay alive in the wilderness during the hard winter. I think this is a very good book. I liked the plot because it stayed at a steady pace, and was exciting. I couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next chapter. One other reason I liked this novel is because it was full of adventure that made me feel like I was right there, with Brian. My only complaint was that the ending seemed too choppy and abrupt."
5,Couldn't put it down,"This book was a perfect addition to his first book ""Hatchet"". I couldn't put it down. It was a page turner."
5,worth every penny,"I bought this suit for a dive trip to the Bahamas in January. It fits well, kept me warm and in the water longer. I bought the one with light purple sleeves. My daughter said I look like a super hero in it. Bonus!"
2,Did not fit,"I thought if I was honest and didn't care about the size I had to order I'd get a great suit for the price. I usually wear a 2 so I ordered an 8 per their size and weight recommendations. Needless to say it did not fit. It was as if someone just randomly cut and designed the suit. Loose on the arms, tight on the legs, the body was almost misshapen, cut sort of weird. We went to a store where I tried on several suits that ALL FIT snugly."
3,Not as good as the first one!,this album was o.k. i guess. the first one was mind blowing lyricism. they had a linguistic lingo that amused everyone and they didn't express one bad word!this second album was kind of good but some songs were not reaching the soul.
4,Lesser Known Facts,"A terrific mix by one of the most independant thinking DJs out there. Boy George packs this cd with rare mixes ( his own ballad ""Julian"", remixed here into a great house track ) and songs that you just don't hear down at your local disco ( the fabulous ""the Dealer""). This is not your everyday DJ mix. And George freely admits that in the liner notes, which to some could be seen as a kind of musical snobery, but in this case he is justifiably proud of this mix."
2,Mind Candy,"This book was a disappointment. Esquivel's *Like Water for Chocolate* was a far superior fable. Esquivel's musical integration is shmaltzy, but not substantive. It is enjoyable, as long as your expectations are not too high"
2,Disappointing,"I loved *Like Water for Chocolate,* so I eagerly awaited the releaseof this novel by Esquivel. I was extremely disappointed bythe novel. I had hard time believing that the same woman whowrote the brilliant *Like Water for Chocolate* also wrote*The Law of Love.* The narrative seemed overly self-conscious,even hollow in spots. The blend of future technology withcurrent day remnants seemed corny. I found myself skippingover the new-age/psycho-babble stuff. I had a difficult timerelating to the characters. In the end I felt like the novelwas a good concept, but not a good book. The multimedia additionsdidn't make up for the mediocre story and plot."
