4,"Life -there is a way, always!","Sometimes we're blocked in suffering, it's not easy to find a way. Those poems encourage us to face suffering and take it easy. Everything is gonna be all right."
1,Not as good as other products,"I bought this a few months ago and ended up giving it away. It didn't do anything for me. But, a doctor recommended Aveeno and that has done the trick for me."
1,"may work for others, didn't at all for me","I have been using this product for 4 days, mornings and night. It does moisturize your skin nicely but has had little effect at all on redness, in fact I think it has made my face more red. Perhaps I am allergic to something in it. Who knows. But I am taking it back to CVS for a refund. Definitely not worth the $35 I spent for it!"
3,Didn't work for me,Maybe it is not for my skin type. I've read that in some other did work. My skin is too sensitive.Thanks anyway.
5,The future of salsa,"Bamboleo is the most sophisticated salsa group to appear since... since... well, since anyone plugged in an electric bass. That means better than NG La Banda, Charanga Habanera, Descarga Boricua, Marc Antony, Elvis Crespo, DLG, etc. I cannot describe how amazing this album is. This is a classic, classic album, ranking alongside the best of the old Fania creations."
3,Should have used Live/Concert Arrangments.,"Although it's pretty good, they should have done the live (as opposed to studio) arrangements. Guitar Solo in COTN should be doubled, 1st instrumental in Strutter should be doubled. There should not have been fade-outs of Deuce and others. Detroit Rock City should have had the concert style ending. Another complaint I have is that (although it's how KISS does it) some songs are tuned down 1/2 step while others are at concert pitch. This creates the hassle of tuning. Since this is a jam-along, everything could have been recorded at concert pitch and sounded just fine. Nice job by all the musicians though."
4,Most underrated British Invasion band,"Until the Who finally cracked the American marketplace the Animals were the third most important of the British Invasion bands. They had several big hits in America without compromising their musical integrity.However, when the original band broke up, the New Animals failed to make consistent recordings and did severe damage to the Animals original reputation. The New Animals were a kickin' live band and that is what we get with this release. That combined with 3 or 4 tracks by the original band make for an exciting collection.The early stuff sounds great and is played well. The later stuff varies in recording quality but is consistently on the mark musically.In short, this is recommended for old and new fans and, hopefully, helps people remember how good both incarnations of the Animals were."
4,"A Mixed Bag, but a ""Must"" for Animals Aficianados","This is a very uneven collection of live material, mostly from the Animals ""psychedelic"" days, but the first three songs make this a ""must"" for die-hard Animals fans. ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" ""Corinna, Corinna,"" and - above all - ""The Work Song"" are rare gems from the Animals early, bluesier lineup. ""The Work Song"" is an absolute classic, and it's surprising that it was never released as a single. (On second thought, its sympathetic portrayal of a black prison convict pining for his woman may have been a bit too edgy for a single in that era.)Almost as good are ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Corinna, Corinna, both of which are also in the blues-rock style of the original Animals. As for the rest of the CD, some it will appeal to fans of the later Animals, but for me the first three tunes were by themselves worth the price of admission."
5,A Little Joy A Little Oy Is Sensational,"Not only is this a fantastic Jewish calendar, ""a Little Joy, A Little Oy"" is more like a book to me. It contains wit and wisdom, humor and pathos, insight and history of the Jewish people. I am sending copies to all my friends and acquaintances for the holidays -- Rosh Hashanna and Yom Kippur especially. I heartily recommend this book, ""A Little Joy, A Little Oy,"" to anyone with any level of interest in Judaism."
3,ok.. but not good with kids,"This product was ok... but did not withstand a toddler. Our daughter knocked down this coat rack a few times. We fixed it with gorilla glue, and it was stable. One night it randomly fell into pieces with only 4 coats hanging on it. It looked wonderful, but was not sturdy enough to stand up to a toddler. I do not recommend it to families with young children."
3,Decent coat rack,This is a fairly sturdy coat rack however the wood is not number 1 grade there are insect flaws in the finish. Does not hinder the performance and is not grossly apperant but I can see it on the unit that I have. I would not advise the lighter color becuase it would probably be even more apperant. The extra hangers that this rack has are very usefull. For the price I would recomend but not if you are real fussy with quality grade wood.
3,Decent coat rack,The coat rack was very easy to assemble but one of the screws broke off one of the arms. I'm going to try gluing it on but I'm not too worried about it. The coat rack seems to be pretty sturdy. Overall it seems good so far. It's nothing special but I'm just using it in my bedroom because I need a place to hang sweatshirts and other stuff.
2,Really nice until it broke,"We were really impressed with this coat rack at first. The design is nice with the spinning top and a good number of pegs to hang coats from. But in less than 9 months all three legs were splitting away from the rack, pretty much turning it into so much scrap wood. If you hang a couple light jackets and hats on it you'll be fine. But with just a couple coats hanging on it (and Texas winter coats aren't particularly heavy) this coat rack was pushed beyond its limits."
1,Lasted only a few weeks and then started to fail.,"Second review 7 months later: Two of the three legs broke down completely without falling. Taking it to dump site. Wood is of very bad quality. Would highly discourage others.First review after few weeks of usage: Looks great. Very sturdy. However, threads on one hook went bad in just 2-3 weeks. We did hang a lot of jackets on it, but no reason for thread to go bad unless it was manufacturing defect. Overall, I still satisfied as price seemed reasonable."
4,"Reject people who reject the ""different""...","The music is relaxing, soothing, spiritual. Ignore silly people who can't see past their own noses. Hook into some R. Carlos Nakai, too."
4,Awesome but reject the shamanism/mysticism,"I love Peter Kater and most of his music without occult or shaman titles in them, because the truth is, it is part of a cult thinking and spiritual darkness. I studied it for years as I did other cults and I know people firsthand who were involved with the illuminated cult and ""ism. Otherwise he has an excellent talent and beautiful spirit in music and melodic creation on the piano and you cannot deny that he has a God-given gift, if and when he ever acknowledges that is truly where it comes from."
3,A useful buy,"I ordered this CD after reading a rather snappy comment on it. I was actually quite satisfied. Indeed the recording is somewhat muffled, as in a bucket of water, but performancewise I can find no reason to be rude to mr. Harasiewicz. I have compared his interpretation with world names like Vladimir Sofronitsky, Shura Cherkassky and John Ogdon. I find myself in no position to state whether mr. Harasiewicz will become a world name, but in order to enjoy Chopin's polonaises, I can claim that his perfomance is precise and neat. He delivers them, as well as the waltzes, very professionally with accuracy which is worth buying. Four stars for performance, two to recording."
3,"Good information, no index at all!","The Illustrated Directory of Guitars tracks the evolution of the acoustic and the electric guitar in two seperate sections. It's a handy size for carrying in your bag, and full of interesting information about the different developments and excellent pictures showing details of guitar models on every page. The influence of many designers and performers is described in brief.Unfortunately, the publisher provided no index to the information, and only a very vague contents page. (eg. Acoustic guitars, section 2: Twentieth Century Developments pp. 79-218) It can hardly be called a directory if there's no way of looking up the information!If you just want a book to read cover-to-cover or to open randomly, though, this could be the book for you."
3,too small,It was hard to tell the size online my family is big and I wanted something that I could store the left overs of the bulk pack spagetti. Way too small for that. It was good quality though.
2,Practically Useless Spaghetti Dispenser,"I purchased this to replace the same sort of product that was falling apart. Yes this does hold the spaghetti, but it doesn't dispense it properly unless you want the entire container full at once (which defeats the purpose of my usage.) The insert, which has two notches on either side of it so that you can get one or more servings, depending on which side you choose, does not stay inserted when you tip over the container. SO all of the spaghetti spills out at once. The lid is also difficult to attach. So in the trash it went and I'll keep using the one I have until I find the exact replacement. I gave it 2 stars because it does hold the spaghetti."
2,Disappointed,"I have a cockatiel, and like any bird owner knows, they sure poop a lot!That's where this product was supposed to help. Sadly though, it just didn't stand up to the choir at hand. While it cleaned up the large sized pieces okay, it left a lot behind. In the end, I had to use old fashioned soap and water to do the job that these couldn't."
3,"LOVE the PRODUCT, NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT THE WIPES!","The product itself is terrific! After using the poop off spray ,I turned to the wipes. The only problem is that every container of wipes I have bought has mildew in it. I just opened a fresh container, and the inner wipes are all mildewed. I guess because there aren't preservatives?? But I don't like using mildewed wipes!"
5,Fast absorption,"I bought this product on a college visit to NY with my daughter. We found a cute little gift and clothing shop and I came across this product. I didn't use it for a while since I had other lotions and cremes that I had vowed to ""use up"" first. I LOVE THIS CREME! I have kept it in the car since I opened it and my daughter and I share it's use. It not only feels good on the skin, it has a very nice, light fragrance that really lasts and it absorbs fast. Not like some that you can't apply at the stop lights and then have ""greasy"" hands for a while until it sinks in."
5,Capacitor review,I ordered the capacitorsand then put them in my television and they worked fine. Better than the originals and the costs wa just a few dollars and a half hour of my time to fix the HDTV. Product shipped immediately and price was extremely reasonable
5,The Bailey Game - Review,"Plot: It's about a boy who gets bullied terribly by the Bridge Boys. That was a long time ago though. A new girl comes from Australia. She finds it hard to settle in. Will Alex help her?Highlights: Alex is my favourite character because she is kind and friendly. My favourite part of the book is when we find out what happens to Bailey.Weaknesses: I think the ending could be stronger.This book is aimed at about 10-13 year olds and I think the book is fantastic!Amber, Year 7, Wallingford"
5,Review Wilton Stepsaving Rose Bouquets Flower Cutter Set,"If you like to work with clay and you love cake, this is the set for you! I am having so much fun creating amazing flowers with this set--my friends think I'm the Picasso of cakes! Set is well-made and easy to use. I'm certain this will be my favorite way to form roses in the future!"
4,great fitting clog,"I am very happy with size, fit, and comfort of the shoe. They are true to size and width."
4,great shoes,These shoes are not only comfortable they are really cute. Everyone at work loved them. I am on my feet all day and they did not ache when I got home. Usually I dont have great luck with shoes ordered through the mail but these are great. I will continue to buy shoes through amazon.
3,a fair book,A great coffee table book but it dosen't include any plans for building a retreat yourself. It isn't a do-it yourself type of book but it is informative and has great pictures.
2,Great but not what I was looking for,"Although the book and information is helpful and thoroughly useful, this is not what I was looking for. I am having a hard time finding - a social area - party area - for outdoors to build along side of the pool. We find we need an (approx 25 x 12) area for indoor/outdoor use when we entertain."
1,Misled,It is too funny that I am sitting here on hold with Polaroid surfing the web trying to find out if this DVD player comes with a battery pack. Low and behold I come across this review which addresses my concern. I too bought this DVD player (2 actually) for a plane ride to Cancun leaving on Sunday. It's a shame that they list the battery time and in the manual it states that it comes with a rechargeable battery but you don't get one?!? How is that? This is complete misrepresentation. For the price you can get one with a battery pack and not have to pay an additional $40.00. Come on Polaroid you can do better than that.
1,Battery Not Included - Cost's $50 extra!!!,"Main thing to think about with this. Most people buy a portable DVD player to be able to not plug it in.. well, this is a good price until you see that it does not come with a rechargable battery. Those cost extra.. So, make sure you know that before you buy!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I bought this item from OUTLET. And this item did not come with a battery!!! I had to then purchase a battery from Polaroid for an extra $40.00. I would of been better off going and buying a brand new one at a local store! No where does it say it doesn't come witha battery. The person at the store OUTLET said she would help me find a battery but I have yet to hear anything! I will never buy anything from there store again!Polaroid 7"" Swivel Portable DVD Player - Pink (DPA-07046P)"
1,Stopped working in less than a year of minimal use,"We bought one of these on a road trip and used it for maybe 20 hours at most in the car. We even took it out of the car when we left to keep it from getting too hot. Once we got home it was used only occasionally as a DVD player for our bedroom TV. It was not moved or exposed to less than ideal conditions (as it would have been in a car). It really was treated like a baby, but it just stopped working after only 10 months. Warranty in the US is only 90 days so it's a total loss. I would recommend trying another brand."
3,Good price but just OK toy,We bought 2 of these while on vacation so we just wanted inexpensive ride-ons. I hoped they would be like our Chicco Trains our boys love at home but this is just a bit smaller and the steering wheel only barely turns the wheels so we were disappointed that it did not even come close to measuring up. My son keeps telling me the steering wheel doesn't work since it hardly does anything. Also there are only 2 buttons - each sings a numbers song. That is the extent of what this ride on does. On the Chicco there are no battery operated noises or songs BUT there are dials and levers that are so much more fun for my boys than pushing the button to play the songs. But these were a good deal for the price to have something on our vacation. Overall I would recommend spending a little more money on something else if this is going to be your primary ride on.
2,Plays only one tune! Boring!,"The child seems to like this toy, but the fact that it only plays one tune can just about drive you bonkers.I think it says ""A,B,C"" and ""1,2,3"", and that's it .... not the entire alphabet ... just 3 letters and 3 numbers. That's hardly what I would call educational."
3,Not really a Reference Grammar,"A decent basic grammar, this book is a bit lightweight to be called a reference grammar.If you want a real reference grammar try Glanville Price's Comprehensive French Grammar"
5,Just the facts. No fluff or redundancies.,"This is a pure reference book: if you need to know the rules without anyone annoyingly hand-holding you with lots of fluff, then this is it. An excellent book for those who can ramp up fast; or who already have gone through the appetizer of the hand-holding books, and now need to get to the meat."
4,Excellent presentation,"I believe that the organ on this album has the only functional 64' stop in the world. This CD displays this stop and the organ, in general, in a very favorable way. I don't know how old Mr. Drury is, but he appears to be fairly young. His presentation, however, shows a maturity beyond his years. I highly recommend the CD."
5,Good Music,I first heard this on an album way back when I was hardly old enough to know what a record was. I think it was about 1978. I have been wanting so bad to find it on a compact disk. I figured that it was out of print. It is nice to know that it is still in print. I have grown up around 18 wheelers most of my life and my mom used to drive a log truck for the company. So many of the songs remind me of the things I saw in the passenger set of that R model Mack. Which is one of the reasons I hate Troopers and Dot of the roads. If you have drove a truck you know what I am talking about. These songs are just the best. I am sure you will agree.
4,Excellent performance but start with Bruckner's masses,"The mystical and original sacred music of Anton Bruckner is best conveyed by bruckner authority Eugen Jochum. While the Te deum and 150.psalm are almost as good as his three masses (available as an outstanding two CD in DG's series the originals - legendary recordings, again conducted by Jochum), the motets are much less powerful and less imaginative. I omitted the star for the quality of the music and not the performance. If you want to listen to Bruckner's sacred works, start with the mentioned CD of masses which like this CD features the great soprano Maria Stader."
2,AWFUL recording!!,"As others have mentioned, this is a wretched recording. The choir sounds as though they're off in the distance, and it's ALL ORCHESTRA in your ear. I got this to practise with as my choral society was performing it, and on the recording of our own performance, we had exactly the same problem--even though we were singing full-blast, we could not be heard over the orchestra. A great, great disappointment.All that aside, this piece really grows on you. I despised it on my first read-through, but I came to love the work. It has the power and intensity of Burana's ""O Fortuna"", even more so because it never, never lets up, not till the explosive ending. It's a piece that will take your heart, shred it, put it back together, and throw it in your face. Awesome."
4,"It works well, but you'll have to also","Bottom line: This converter does a good job of converting my iphone signal to the stock 06 Passat stereo; however, it took me several hours of dinking around before I realized the male end (part of what I bought) has several tiny pins that need to fit into the VW CD changer female end, but either the male pins are too thick or the female is too tight. That's wonderful in some settings, but not this one. I was convinced I had purchased an item not compatible with my CD changer input. I ended up taking a sewing needle and prying apart the female receivers so that the pins had a fighting change to make the connection. It worked.This is a great alternative to buying a new head unit. With a little ingenuity you can feed your 1/8"" plug through the glove box and have it ready and waiting in one of your slide out compartments. I ended up just keeping it in the glove box."
1,Turrible,"This product seemed like a good idea, was doing half swings indoors at first, then finally took it outside and did a full swing, the dang thing broke off and flew and hit my buddys headlight, like the title says...turrible"
5,A Bus review,"Excellent system, AB 902 kit comes with all the parts needed to make a single input, whole house audio system for 4 rooms. I'm going to expand mine to more rooms by adding 1 more piece. Easy to setup, install, and use. I recomend this as a good, low cost option for whole house music systems."
3,Dn't waste your time,I thought it was the group SOLO. I've never heard so much swearing nad such. I wish I could send it back.
2,"Tiny, Tiny Picks","These picks were cute enough, but they were smaller than expected. Don't expect to use for spearing a sandwich or more that one or two small olives"
2,banned in america volume 6,"B.I.A volume 6 is NOT as good as chapters 1-5 as i have been waiting a long time for this chapter 6 in fact since 2003 when it was made it dont have no voice over/commentary and it dont have the original banned in america soundtrack if you are a true b.i.a fan like and i am you will be very disappointed with chapter 6, its typical brain damage films trying to take over the dvd series. VOLUME 6 is a FLOP....."
5,A Lesson For All,"If you are not satisfied with where you are in life, this book is for you. If you ARE satisfied, this book is for you! For those searching for direction, this book provides it. More importantly, those who are simply satisfied with their station in life, this book will provide you with a guide and the inspiration to seek even more. Here you will find the roadmap to true joy instead of everyday happiness.A thoroughly enjoyable book, one that is very difficult to stop reading. The story is one of fiction, but the lesson is one of powerful truth. It focuses on those of us who have simply accepted the status quo...that we are to accept what we have always done as the best way. It will inspire you to seek a better way, a better life.This is my second Cecil Kemp book and there will definitely be more to follow. Read this book, get out of your comfort zone and find the joy in life that is available to those who seek it!"
2,Not so great race track.,"My kids enjoyed it the first few times- but had difficulty assembling it alone (4 and 5 years old). Its too big to leave assembled and they got bored with it quickly. If you lose the connector parts - you are hosed.Now, at my girlfriends house, the kids played with it endlessly . . . go figure."
3,Good ideas,"First Line:""Imagine for a moment that you are holding a bowl of chicken noodle soup.""Thus starts the voyage of eating mindfully. The chapter headings tell the reader what they will learn:Mindful of the mindMindful of the bodyMindful of the feelingsMindful of the thoughtsMindful eating motivationsAs the reader learns the different ways s/he appraoaches food and eating, it gets easier to pick the right foods. Pay attention to what your body is telling you."
3,Disappointed....,"I had read the book Eating MindfullyEating Mindfully: How to End Mindless Eating and Enjoy a Balanced Relationship with Foodand wanted to share it with my sister. I went to Amazon and bought a used copy that of course cost more in postage than it did in the used price! :O) She received the two books I had sent, but there was no indication of ""who"" had sent her this gift....and, the book didn't have the most important part, the CD in the back! Needless to say, I regretted not ordering a new copy. An unhappy customer, Trish"
5,long time forgoten,"heard this a long time ago and had almost forgotten it. for some reason I remembered this CD last month, looked for it at Amazon. And Yes, it was there, great!!"
2,Ethical Dilemma,"The product review states that the Instructor on this DVD ""is the founder of Jeet Kune Do the System Without a System(r)."" Now....technically I guess if he incorporates ""the System without a System"" in the title of HIS system....its legal...BUT....everyone who studies Martial Arts knows that Bruce Lee founded Jeet Kun Do and nobody else. I wanted very much to purchase this DVD but hesitate because of this claim. I have studied other Martial Arts and attended seminars on Jeet Kun Do so I wanted to possibly incorporate more of it in my training. While the content of this product may be exceptional...I take issue with the Instructor's claim. Its an insult to the memory and accomplishments of a stellar Martial Artist."
4,Tiffany style lamp,The lamp is very pretty. However it does not take a 60 watt bulb like it claims in the description. But a 40 watt type B bulb. Therefore not bright enough for my use. I should have sent it back!
3,high expectations unmet,"I received this CD as a gift and hate that this is a negative review. There is no denying Stecher's technical skill. But most of these songs are supposed to be haunting -- esp. ""Oh the wind and the rain"" -- but they are nowhere near. Each sounds very much like the next. Stecher's voice is singular but there is little vocal or instrumental variation. (Often the voice and the instruments sound to be in frantic competition, which is hard on the ear.) The actual words of the songs are effective in themselves (if you listen closely), but the presentation is not. The closest example of what I was hoping for is ""Gypsy Davy,"" but it is the exception and not the norm."
5,Must Have For Parrot Owners,"Anyone who owns a parrot knows that bird poop is like cement once it dries. Poop-Off disolves it easily from any surface, including cloth."
5,A family favorite,"We are not a big a candy family; however, after we bought our first bag of these in Switzerland we loaded up with several bags for the trip home. A great mix between sweet and ""saure."""
3,Something isn't right here...,"Something isn't right here. Where are the feathers? The scaly velociraptor mongoliensis and therizinosaurus(pardon me for spelling [if it's not right]) look less likely than a tyrannosaurus with wings. And on a page about Stegos, i read that ""Stegosaurs, like MOST DINOSAURS [My caps] are COLDBLOODED. That is not right! And i thought that ever since the time Gregory S. Paul's every Theropod being feathery theory, dinosaurs were becoming faster, smarter, and featherier in the public eye! Well, gees, did this book ever prove me wrong! And by the way, except for a couple of feathery fellows, how come they're all brown or maybe a little dull red? Frankly, although there is good info here, go for The Field Guide to Dinosaurs by Henry Gee for the dino's life."
5,Great info on a great aircraft,A fantastic book. Very informative and corrects some info that was in error in Part 1. The color plates are alone worth the price of the book. I highly recommennd this book to anyone with even a remote interest in WW1 aircraft.
5,Great Smoothie Maker,I recently replaced my broken Kitchen Aid Professional Blender with the Waring Pro Retro Blender. I LOVE this appliance. It's sleek styling looks great on my countertop and it crushes ice in mere seconds. I have made thick smoothies that fill almost the entire glass jar and the Waring has no problem blending ice and frozen fruit. I have read some negative reviews of this blender and I am truly mystified by them. I have tried many different brands and no blender comes close to this one in terms of blending power and pure aesthetics.
1,Waring Out Its Welcome,I've had two break within three months. The assembly gets loose and won't do anything. Very frustrating.
2,"No customer service, don't buy from waring","This blender had a lot of issues, the rubber black lines cracked and fell out after a few months, and then the blade stopped turning, even though the motor seems fine.Called waring, tried to use their website, but it seems there is not even a customer service department. So disappointed, as I purchased this blender because of the 5 year warranty."
5,Deeply stirring,"I can not say enough about the beauty of this music. It is great for healing/energy work. You can get lost in the imagery that it can conjure up. Sometimes the layers that are revealed while listening can bring about sadness, peace, or pure relaxation. You should definately try it if you are into reflection and meditation."
5,VB6 DEAD ?,"Helloooo! VB 6 is dead! <--------- You are in denial.First off VB will never leave you in the dry.1. VB is owned by Microsoft and will never be ported to Linux or Mac.2. VB has continued to have new releases.3. C++ uses directx just like the rest of programming languages for games.4. VB dominates in database programming. [MMO] Game DataBase!5. It is possible to code in VB, that can run faster than C++.6. Most people who bash VB do not know how to code in it and claim it to be for beginners when they only seen the dev. Fact is VB can do anything C++ can if you know how to code it.7. So i say read and know what you are talking about before shooting off at the lips about something you have no clue about. Try looking at the development and then retract your comment."
3,Companion to key,"The book is meant to be used as a companion to a key for hardwood identification by microscopic means. Initially this key utilised punched cards, but it has (of course) been computerised. Note that the actual key is not included here. The present work is intended to describe and illustrate the 91 (99) wood anatomical characters used in this key. Illustrations are 66 half-tone plates of four (sometimes two or three) 6x9cm black&white photomicrographs: note that the plates belonging to fig 62 & 63 were inadvertently interchanged. In addition there is one (historical) plate illustrating the author in his lab.Since the characters used are fairly orthodox this book can also be used as a illustrated list of wood anatomical characters, as an alternative or a supplement to the IAWA-list (issued from Leiden: eevn@euronet.nl). Since this CSIRO key is published in Australia, the woods illustrated tend to be from Australia or its adjacent areas."
4,How the Other Three Quarters Lived,"For the most part histories are of the high and mighty, the top-dogs, and the movers and shakers. This one examines life amongst the lower classes of serfs and freemen. This should not be the first basic medieval history one reads, but it provides depth and breadth to expand a person's understanding of medieval times.The author makes good use of sources and documents them well. I consider this as a work for those seeking to learn more about the subject than was covered in their general education. It's for budding medievalists or an introduction for those who might choose to go deeper."
5,I was swept away on this series,I thought this is a great romantic seires. Kira and Rei a weird couple yes. Shy and sweet quiet artist girl to Dangerous bad boy that does what he wants. But I loved how the started the first volume. It already showed so things that will come ahead to this couple. Some people look for the art in manga but it wasn't like that for me. I liked the art and this a old manga but has been proveing to this girl that many has loved this series for the beauty of it's story and art. For romance I recommend this book. They already get this couple in some very sweet moments :). I get lost in this series every time I read it. To know more about the series I so recommend buying the fullength series which is 15 books. I love reading them over and over. I hope you find yourself swept away as I was when I read the first book then I couldn't stop reading after that I had to the next one then the next one. You get so later yo.
1,Traditional Shojo manga.... Predictable storyline,"Don't let the eye candies fool you, this manga lacks substance. While the artwork is well-drawn (though in rather unoriginal same old shojo style), I don't see any emotional depth in it.How does the storyline go? Well, basically, it's about a girl who used to hate the main male protagonist, but she started agonizing over her unexplainable attraction to him (because he admired her work, a sculpture of Mars, by kissing it...). The main male character promised to protect her unconditionally but for what? Just because he fell in love with her arts (huh?).Unfortunately for the female main character, because she is now the target of many jealous girls who go gaga over the male protagonist. (*groans*)If you don't mind the cliche storyline but more interested in beautiful characters, well, this manga is for you. Readers who are expecting a realistic love story..., sorry, this is not it."
5,Opposites attract,"In this book...opposites do attract! Rei Kashino...top rebel at the school falls for Kira Aso...someone that's very very..uh..different from the rest...not very noticeable. This book is an amazing book!! Its filled with love, angst, comedy, action...everything in just one book.*PLOT SUMMARY*Rei's a number one rebel...he doesn't get good grades, gets in trouble...and to top it all of, he's a racer! He sits in class next to a girl named Kira Aso..a girl that's shy and talked about. Somehow...they end up helping each other and at the same time, start to like each other.GREAT BOOK!!! MUST HAVE!!"
4,Good material but bad presentation.,"This is a very interesting documentary with some really cool interviews with people like Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Bernardo Bertolucci and Philip Glass as well as The Dalai Lama himself.This DVD's biggest weakness is low production value, particularly the editing. However the subject matter, people, and information in the film are all worth putting up with some bad green screen."
1,Beware!,"I have heard this is a good video, but I may never know. Ordered this in the spring and never got the DVD. Buyer Beware."
3,Allmusic review plus note on other editions,"This session was released with four alternate takes tacked on the end under Kenny Dorham's name as ""West 42nd Street"" Black Lion. Scott Yanow of allmusic gave it three stars and said this about it:""The date included on this CD reissue was originally led by the obscure tenor Rocky Boyd but has come back under trumpeter Kenny Dorham's name with the six songs augmented by four alternate takes. Boyd (whose style mixes together the influences of Hank Mobley and John Coltrane) blends in well with Dorham, the rhythm section (pianist Walter Bishop, Jr., bassist Ron Carter and drummer Pete La Roca) is excellent and the repertoire (group originals plus ""Samba De Orpheus"" and two slow versions of ""Stella by Starlight"") generally inspires the players. It's funny how La Roca's original ""Why Not"" has exactly the same melody and chord structure as Coltrane's ""Impressions."" This CD is worth picking up by straightahead jazz collectors."""
5,Wonderful!,This is a wonderful DVD. I highly recommend it! If you like music at it's best than you will love this. I have watched it over and over since it arrived. Enjoy!
5,Chinese Classic with a Capital C,"The CD is gorgeous, but the DVD is worth the price alone because one of the cuts is a long concert of Lang Lang playing many of the songs on the album, kind of like having your own front-row seat. What a treasure!"
4,Chinese crossover to delight the millions,"I'm sure that this CD will sell literally by the millions in Asia, but it doesn't sound like exploitation. Lang Lang has gerat charm and sincerity as the foremost musical mabassador of his native country. Two days ago I heard him in recital in Boston, and the audience greeted six of these Dragon Songs with hysterical enthusiasm and flashbulbs twinkling around the hall. I couldn't resist, either. None of this music is taxing, or even that exotic. We get quite mildly Westernized versions of Chinese harmony, and the arrangements, by various Chinese composers, are like Ravel crossed with John Williams for the most part--tuneful nd atmospheric. There's plenty of virtuosity on display, harking back to the days when the piano was chiefly used by barnstorming keyboard wizards to dazzle the crowds. Lang Lang certainly does that here, and although the Yellow River Concerto is the Chinese equivalnet of the Warsaw Concerto from yesteryear, it fits the bill."
4,Very nice chinese piano music,"I am glad Lang Lang made this recording. I bought it right after I learned its existence. I enjoeyed listeing to it. His technique is flawless. However, I feel his understanding of the Yellow River piano concerto is very limited due to his age and experience. He needs to read more about Chinese history and literature in order to understand these music better. Perhaps being more educated in histroy and literature is what he needs for all of the music he plays."
5,Good,These are a little stronger than most of the similar ones found in stores. They are clearly not for climbing or any heavy use. They work great for tying down the cargo net in the back of my SUV and clipping my dog's lead to a tree when he gets the stink washed off.
4,Not climbing with them,Cheap and good. Have not started sticking after 6 months and spending the majority of their life on the water. Use them for connecting gear to paddle bags on kayaks. Still the same color and durable.
1,Awful movie in any format!,"This is the worst recent release movie I have seen that I can ever remember! The script is bad, the acting bad, the language and sexual references are just gross without any humor at all. I can think of no reason to recommend this movie to anyone - ever! I want the lost 1 and 1/2 hours of my life back!"
3,vacuous,"First off, I love Cameron Diaz as an actress. Most of what she's been in has been pretty good if not great. There's nothing wrong with her acting here either. It's the writing. The story is diluted to show a minimum of outrageous stunts - most of them even turned to some sort of positive in this day of political correctness. The highlights you see in the trailers are ALL you will see in the movie. There really isn't that much bad behavior. True to political correctness, the movie ends with her getting a soul, falling in love with the underdog, and changing her entire personality and outlook on life. I wanted to puke. Enough already with the political correct politics and moral messages in what is supposed to be a free expression of an art form."
3,bad teacher,didnt see to much difference in the unrated edition. thought i would see some funny clips not in the regular movie.
1,Bad Teacher BAD movie,"This movie was horrible, we couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. Totally tasteless, tacky and not even close to funny. Don't waste your time and money on this.Bad Teacher"
1,One of the few movies I couldn't finish,"The story was so un-compelling that even though we paid for the rental, we stopped ~25 minutes in and decided to do chores instead of subject ourselves to more of it."
2,I guess I shouldn't be surprised...,"I mean, really, when was the last time Diaz was in a good movie. Actually, I thought Justin Timberlake was a hoot. Overall, the movie is cliche, predictable, and more painfully awkward than funny. (There were, however, a couple of good moments.) I guess, for a $1 rental, I can't complain too much but don't buy this movie; that just encourages Hollywood to make more of this junk...Not recommended."
1,terrible.,"1st off, Cameron Diaz was grossly miscast in this role. There were probably dozens of actresses who could have played this role better (how does she keep getting job after job after job?? She's an AWFUL actress - at best).Now i like funny and sexy as much as anyone. But these ""jokes"" were just downright crude and not even a little bit funny. This makes the Seth Rogen-type comedies look like Gone With the Wind.Although all the roles were bad, Justin Timberlake did the best job in his, rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop, proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash.Its lucky to get a one-star rating here, as you can't dish out zero stars. Avoid at all costs."
1,lowest common denominator,"Only movie we could agree to watch at my Thanksgiving gathering. Don't expect more than Cameron Diaz as a narcissistic, an overly made up gold digger in search of bigger boobs. There seems to be several scenes missing that would help to explain the ending."
1,"Horrible, Horrible","What more is to be expected from Cameron Diaz? No wit and no talent, really. This movie is nothing more than a waste of money."
1,"Horrible, just horrible",Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake should have gotten married since they are perfect for each other. Both are overrated and neither can act. This movie has no redeeming qualities.
2,Bad Teacher,"I had high expectations for this movie, and was sorely let-down. A mix of School of Rock and every other ""teacher"" movie out there, it was predictable and drawn out. I saw how the movie was going to end about 10 minutes into it and the rest was less-than-funny filler. Justin Timberlake's character was my least favorite of the movie, and the whole time his bad acting left a horrible taste in my mouth. Paired up with Cameron Diaz's equally awful acting, it was a waste of money to even rent this."
1,Waste of time. Not funny at all. Vulgar.,"Diaz and Timberlake must have done this film as a favor to a friend or to settle an obligation. Bad acting, bad script, no out loud laughter moments at all. Stupid waste of time and money."
3,"Kinda Funny, But Seen Better","Meh, this movie was okay. It was kinda funny, but I have seen better in this brand of comedy. I would say it's worth a watch, but probably not much more."
1,Don't waste your money!,Terrible movie that I wished I would have rented before buying! Learned the hard way! It was an expensive mistake to have bought this Blu-ray......
4,Good Movie!,"I really really liked this movie. It's definetly no where close to real-life, but I loved it. I love movies that you can put in and it requires little thought to get whats going on. Its just enjoyable to watch. My husband enjoyed it to. I expected Justin's character to have a bigger part, but I was surprised by how much I liked Jason Segal in the movie. I was disappointed because I watched the redband trailer and in the movie some of the more vulgur lines were not in the movie that were in the trailer. Hoping for an unrated DVD release."
1,"should have called it just ""Bad""","I wanted to like this movie, but my friend, Cameron Diaz cannot carry a movie, and poor Justin Timerblake was poorly cast as the geeky sidekick.Save your money and leave this one at the store."
2,Not Bad Enough,"The idea has potential, but it was thrown together by 8th graders. It could have been Twenty First Century Animal House on Hip Hop and wound up as a sort of Hanna Montana with a very mild dose of attitude. Missed opportunity to create a classic. Too bad."
1,There is Bad and then there is Really Bad,"I like Diaz, what a sad waste of talent. This movie is triple bad: bad script, bad story, bad acting ... Then again, the actors are as good as the script allows. There are so many possible comedies for grabs about teachers or students and administrators in academia and this is the best they can do? Is Diaz using the F word and C word and S word supposed to make us laugh? Yea maybe if they surgically remove 3/4 of your brain?..."
3,"Not for everyone, but I liked it","Kind of lame, but I did like the arch humor between Diaz and her ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake. When they dry-hump here, you know they knew that people would find that titilating. But Diaz is getting a little older now, and she is not as hot as she once was. But Timberlake just keeps looking younger, absurdly so, in this film. The non-stop expletives uttered in the wrong locales are a big part of what humor this movie relies upon. I thought it was funny, but not everyone will get the jokes here."
1,piss poor,movie played until carwash scene. then was not audiable.code 3 kept popping up indicating the movie was pirated.a waste of my hard earned money. will never order from amazon again.
2,Not bad enough,"Despite its title, Bad Teacher was quite tame. The envelope could've been pushed further. The humor was a bit dry; not surprising since Bad Teacher was written by a guy who wrote for NBC's The Office. The film moved at a slow, uneventful pace causing my mind to wander...no ADHD here...the movie was just a major bore. The car wash scene seemed like a desperate measure to spark audience interest after a dull start. No offense to Ms. Diaz, she's super hot, but Liv Tyler's scrub-down in One Night at McCools is the best theatrical car wash scene. McCool's left a little for the imagination. On a positive note, Cameron absolutely nails her role as World's Bitchiest Teacher. Bad Teacher is best suited for die-hard Diaz fans only."
3,Hot for teacher,She is hot and steamy. She is a terrible person totaly self centered. She is nt aboving using her assets to get what she wants. Totally believable.
3,Bad Apple.,"Bad Teacher starring Cameron Diaz is a comedy that has some good moments but mostly bad moments. Diaz gives a solid performance as Elizabeth, a horrible English teacher who is vulgar and downright mean. I don't like how her character wants to get breast implants because she think it will increase her odds of scoring a rich husband. Justin Timberlake is just horrible in this, and it's really strange that he used to date Diaz and they have virtually no chemisty onscreen. Jason Segel also falls flat, the only other actor I thought was funny was Lucy Punch. I like Cameron Diaz but she deserves better material. It's a mixed bag for me."
4,Loved this movie,"She was so mean to those kids, you just sit there laughing think ""oh my gawd did she rlly just do that to the fat kid"". Of course she learns a lesson and yadda yadda. It do not rlly know how to describe this movie except hilarious and i highly recommemd it"
3,BadTeacher- Great previews,"Recently purchased Bad Teacher and had been wanting to see it for quite some time due to the Previews being funny and of course a carwash scene with Camron Diaz, well, that's about the best part of this movie, the previews, story line is dumb, Unrated version is just alot of cussing that does not fit. Behind the scenes is a bunch of fluff to make then say they have a behind the scenes section. If you can find this at a rental price , then get it, other than that, it's worth a buck to see a bit of Camron Diaz and listen to her talk dirty in the first few minutes of the movie."
5,Very good,Nice people good product i buy moré moré moré from this people any time i like The product very good
2,waist of money,"this was one of the most stupid movie ever, it didnt even finish watching it, carmen diaz wasn't really acting."
1,"Yep, it's that bad.","Wow. This movie is awful. I don't know if the people that made this movie expected the audience to sympathize with the main character, but it is impossible. She is a horrible person. Now, in other movies this type of character could be likable if they are at least funny, but that was not the case with this movie. Everything she did was horrible and selfish and SHE GOT AWAY WITH everything. Drugging and blackmailing a superintendent, cheating on standardized tests, not teaching her class anything for a whole school year, stealing someone else's boyfriend, stealing money from the school; she gets away with all that and more. Ugh what a disgrace of a movie. Definitely skip this one. I think the whole point of the movie was for Cameron Diaz to show off her body."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"Sadly, I like watching Cameron Diaz...but this was not one of those times. I would have to agree with most of the rest of the reviews placed for this movie. Its fairly awful. If you must see it...rent it...dont bother with buying the DVD as you are wasting a good chunk of change.I am glad I only rented this online. Would have been horrified to have paid 19.95+ for this sad trash."
2,2 Minute trailer far better than the entire film!,"I had been wanting to see this movie since I saw the previews - since seeing it, I could have just as well stuck with the previews. It was as if someone filmed short clips and stuck them together - there were many parts of the film that did not transition very well, and there was very little chemistry between the actors in the movie. To keep this short, I will not be watching this movie again."
2,Why Was This Movie Made?,This supposedly funny movie about a bad teacher who supposedly redeems herself doesn't do anything but bore and stupefy. How was this movie made?
2,Trailers were funnier than the movie,"The trailers were skillfully editted and presented a funny and cute movie. The title is accurate - ""bad teacher"" - language, sex, drugs, shallow nature all of which would be inappropriate for a young audience. A more mature audience would probably not appreciate this movie. Teenage boys will likely give this movie 5 stars. Where as an adult might rate this at 2-3 stars. Teachers may find this movie offensive."
1,Bad Teacher,"This movie makes you feel that you need a shower after watching it and what's worst of all is that you know children will watch it. In the media, Cameron and Justin put themselves out there as having social causes and being socially conscience and then make this vulgar piece of garbage. They are nothing but hypocrites and apparently that desperate for money that they would be involved with this low life movie. I really use to like Cameron and Justin. Amazon, I hate it when you pimp out movies like this one. Now I know what it's like to give a prostitute money."
1,Yawn,Too set up. I tried watching it about 3 times...however I kept falling asleep thank God it was only a Black Friday special
2,Save Your Money,This movie was aweful. Not even close to funny. Cameron Diaz was disappointing and her character was a hot mess. I had high hopes because the trailer was hilarious - the movie was not.
1,If I could have I would have given this movie zero stars,"I can't even begin to tell you how much this movie lowered my IQ by merely watching it. What happened to Cameron Diaz?? she used to be funny in an intelligent way,I guess dating boy band members really did a job on her! I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this poor excuse for a comedy."
1,"Horrible, trite, cliche, lame","This movie is awful and I hate that I spent money to see it in theaters. I was advertised that Jason Segul would be in it, in which he was. He couldn't have been in this for more than ten minutes. He was pretty funny every time because of his demeanor but... this entire thing revolved around Cameron Diaz and she's just not funny period. Then she realizes her flaws out of nowhere without any convincingness. The jokes were pretty awful and I don't mind low brow jokes but this was terrible. This movie was by far my least favorite movie of the year."
2,Skip it,"Not even funny. They just put a bunch of quirky personalities together and hoped for the best. Didn't work. Typical Cameron movie, with no depth."
4,funny movie,"Watched this last night and I liked it, really funny and Cameron Diaz was too funny as a teacher. When she was hitting the students in the stomach with the dodgeballs that was hilarious!! THis is a good movie that made me laugh, I'll definitely be buying this one!!"
3,BAD Teacher,"A new slant on life. Makes a person thoughtful about some of the truisms of life, not only in teaching; but nearly every vocation as well."
3,hit and miss,the kind of movie on a saturday night when you wanted a few good laughs and not think a whole lot this film works. it has missed chances at being funnier and there is alot of past cliches that i have seen done before in other classroom comedy based films. however what does make the film work is that there have been news storys over the past decade and change of some teachers such as what is being portrayed in this film and some seeking out things to induldge in which doesn't have a thing to do with higher education. its the kind of film you don't spend alot of time thinking about and just roll with it for what it is.
1,Waste of time and money,"Stupid movie. Why would a gold-digger be a teacher? Why does this movie paint women as gold-digging, vain jerks. The only funny parts where what was shown in the trailer. Skip this horrible movie!"
5,surprisingly funny,"Yes this movie is raunchy and over the top, but I loved it. There are awkward parts and it is R rated for a reason, but this is the best comedy I've seen all year. Don't take it seriously and you'll love it!"
1,"Bad Teacher, more like Bad Movie","Raunchy, disgusting, sounded like every other word was a swear word. It seemed like the film makers didn't care. Thinking about buying it DON'T."
1,A waste of money,"I was hoping for some quality comedy, but the best parts were in the trailer. This movie was pert-near a B movie! What a seriously dumb move on my part in purchasing this rental. At least I didn't buy the movie. I would say that it is worth 99 cents."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"We watched the theatrical version which is on the same DVD as the unrated version. This movie is awful! So sorry I wasted my time. Like others have said, the trailer was the best part of the movie."
2,more like TERRIBLE teacher,I honestly thought this movie would be something really funny so I bought it thinking I would like it. WOW was I wrong. Cameron Diaz doesn't fit the role as well as other actresses would. Waste of time and money.. Thank god it was on sale..
4,Fun DVD,Good watch for an evening. DVD was in good condition and was received in a prompt manner. We enjoyed viewing it. Would recommend to an adult fun group.
3,funny,"LOL, now this was actually a funny movie. It was a little rude, but it was funny.. LOLLLLLLL not sure why the other views were so harsh, but it was funny.. I am happy I didn't go to a movie theater, it was def. made for DVD.. watch it, you will laugh"
3,Mediocre at best.,The funniest characters are barely in the movie. There are some funny parts but as a whole its just not that funny. If you need to kill some time and have nothing to watch give it a shot but dont expect much. Its not terrible but its mediocre at best.
2,"Lucy Punch, YES! Everything else, NO!","We don't need any more bad teachers, not even goodlooking ones. There are a few moments here that are funny but not many. Lucy Punch, looking far more beautiful, smart, and sexy than Cameron Diaz, as well as being a much better actress, is the star of the show. I want to see more of her everywhere."
1,Bad Teacher=Bad Movie,"Bad Teacher=Bad Movie. Just shows you how trashy the ""actors"" really are for taking lead roles in this pre-teen/T&A TRASH film - as if we didn't already know that with casting Justin (Super Bowl Sleaze) Timberlake. The writer must of been on some heavy medication to even come up with this wreck of a storyline. Basically raunchy soft porn for the raging hormonal adolescent."
1,Bad Teacher = BAD MOVIE,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. There was not even one funny scene...plenty of disgusting scenes, but no comedy. Bad acting, bad story, bad everything. I want my two hours back, please."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!!,"I saw some of the clips that they used to promote the movie and I thought that this could be a some worth watching. Oh how I was badly disappointed. This is utter rubbish and like someone mentioned in a previous review, which I regrettably missed before renting this movie. Do not rent it unless you like crude terrible acting with no theme or plot to speak of.Not even Justin Timberlake could save it.Give it a big miss I beg of you."
1,Bad? More like terrible...,"There was nothing fun or funny about this movie (I knew the reviews weren't good, but I thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts -- I was wrong). There was no chemistry between Cameron and the PE teacher. I couldn't tell if Justin T's character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting. There were zero likeable characters and no character development. From watching the movie, I had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone. Did something happen to her as a child? A little background would be nice. Overall, pointless."
1,Bad is Lousy,I like both Cameron and Justin but this movie showed their probably worst performance because of the really lousy script. I know that the f word has been integrated into our language but here it was totally out of place. This movie shows that the stars alone don't make a good movie.
1,worst movie ever,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie, I even sat through the whole movie hoping that it would turn around. But I have to say it was the worst movie I have ever seen. You would think that with all the ""star power"" that was in the movie that there would be some good points...but I am sorry to say NO. AWFUL! (FYI: you might like the movie if middle school humor is your thing)."
1,"Just awful. Horrible acting, plot, writing. You name it.","Probably in the top 5 worst movies of all time for me. Surprisingly profane, but that's not what did it. You can tell the actors must've been bored because the entire plot, writing, acting are horrible. But then again, I did only make it about 20 mins in before I gave up."
1,Horrible!,"This movie was a waste of time and money. There was no point to this movie. It was crude and pointless. When the movie ended I was just like, what the heck was the point of that? Don't waste your time."
3,Watchable for Diaz fans,"I love Cameron Diaz. Justin Timberlake is a pretty good actor in my opinion, as well as Jason Siegel. In fact there are a lot of good actors/characters in this movie. I think the problem is probably with the director/editor? The timing of everything seemed a little off so that what could've been a much better movie was just ok. It was hard to get through the beginning, it is a cute story- just off the way it was directed."
3,Seriously?!,"I actually like Bad Teacher, mostly because I had similar teachers during junior high and love Lucy Punch as the quirky teacher Amy Squirrel. I've watched the movie several times on Starz and I eventually bought Unrated Edition DVD for a $1.96 at a Black Friday sale.Why the three star rating?Bad Teacher is funny at times, but it could have much better. Considering the R rating, I expected it to be more raunchier like more recent comedies, like The Hangover, Bridesmaids, and 21 Jump Street, but instead the writers decided to play it safe. I would have liked to seen more the classroom antics with Cameron Diaz and of course the plot could have been better.Overall, I still like the movie, but it is not the greatest comedy."
3,Okay,"Okay Cameron, but nothing to write home about! You may have passed the age when it might have been FUN to watch U in this role....... as a 20 something 'bad ass' girl."
1,A Very Horrible Movie,"This is one of the most horrible movies out there. I thought it was going to be a great movie particularly because of Cameron Diaz (she's one of my favourite actresses), but it wasn't. Justin Timberlake was equally horrible. He just looked good in his nerd outfit. I don't know the other characters well, but they were also terrible. It wasn't funny at all and the movie was boring. Don't waste your time and money on this film. Look elsewhere."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","This movie is a disgrace. Highly offensive to the educational system (and teachers) and just painful to watch. Apparently, in the education world, being a cheat does get your ahead!? I think not."
2,It's alright funny,"I felt like the whole concept of Bad Teacher was stupid. However, I did laugh at parts. This has more of a stupid humor. The story line wasn't very good at all. This is only worth a rental and not a purchase! I just felt like the whole movie was off for some reason, that the characters and story was just there for the sake of being there with no real purpose. I don't really know who to describe it. It almost seemed by the end of the movie nothing was really achieved and we're at the beginning again. Overall, two stars for at least keeping me semi interested with barely decent humor."
3,"Interesting Movie. However, Lacks A Clear Heart And Resolution To Sub-Plot.","Note: I just saw this film with XFinity On Demand.This is an interesting film, with at least one funny line and plenty of raunchy material. The story is intriguing, but it lacks a clear resolution to the sub-plot of the kid who loves a girl, and it also lacks heart, especially Ms. Diaz' character actually changing through the course of the film from an insensitive, f-bomb teacher to someone who genuinely cares about her students, much like her her rival in the film. Unfortunately, God's name is profaned again. (Why do actors feel that throwing around the Lord's name in vain is funny?) Should have been rated PG-13."
2,OK comedy Funny but not great,"I felt this movie under delivered in the humor department. There were a couple of VERY funny scenes, but all in all, came up a bit short. This is a good movie to catch on cable, but not as a pay-per-view or in the theater. Cameron Diaz was very funny, but was a bit saddled with some forced dialog; trying too hard to be shocking. While Justin Timberlake delivered a solid performance, his character was so creepy, it made the audience uncomfortable to watch him. The one scene with Diaz and Timberlake was just plain disturbing!"
2,not very good,"it was just not a great movie, but obviously entertaining if I watched it till the end :( Still, I have seen other silly movies that were not so bad. Perhaps because at least something in the movies was believable; IN this one - perhaps there are plenty of teachers who smoke pot, but not the kind where a teacher comes to work dressed in mini skirt and crazy hills."
3,Ok,Not the worst nor the best movie. It was ok. Depends on what u r wanting to watch. It had some funny moments. I wouldn't buy it but renting is a good option.
3,Entertaining but not very funny,"The movie was entertaining, but not that funny. I like Cameron Diaz, that is probably why I gave it three stars."
3,Light and amusing & didn't get stuck in my teeth,"I rented this on a day where I was starting to get sick. I had no ambition and did not want to watch another kids show with my 3 year old.This worked perfect. It was light and fluffy and made me giggle. Miss Squirrel was awesome! I was very amused by sidekick Lynn's marshmallow playing off Elizabeth's perpetual crunchy attitude. Would have liked to see more of the gym teacher, and loved how ""that"" ended. It is a challenge to lead a story with such an anti-hero, but I thought it worked.You do have to suspend your concept of reality - if this were really a school, most of these teachers/ staff would have been brought up on charges of some kind or another."
3,Eh,"Thought this movie was suppose to be HILARIOUS like so many people had said, but this ain't no ""Old School""!"
3,Cameron Does Billy Bob,"You can nutshell this as ""Bad Santa"" on estrogen. No surprises here. This is a catalogue of rude behavior that doesn't include Cameron Diaz soiling herself or seducing her students. Diaz is adequate, not remarkable, in the title role. Jason Segel is essentially wasted as the gym teacher and frustrated suitor for Diaz's affections. Justin Timberlake, though, continues to impress as a nerdy substitute teacher. Lucy Punch is a real find as Diaz's squirrely adversary. Regardless, if you want to see women behaving badly watch a repeat of ""Ab-Fab""."
3,Funny but a very bad message,"i never thought cd was anything too look at but then again, i'm a female. one thing i do think she excels at is comedic acting. she is freaking hi-larious in this film. justin timberlake is just as good in his role. the casting was spot on for every character.the overall message however is extremely immoral which made it fall flat in the end. this woman does all sorts of really mean and crappy things (albeit funny) but is never called on it. ever. the annoying but innocent coworker gets the shaft. i ended up feeling sorry for her.not a good message for the young folks."
3,REALLY A 'BAD TEACHER',"This is not only 'a bad teacher' character but a bad movie. I figured with celebrities like Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz, this would be a good movie, not necessarily classic but definitely worth a few dozen laughs and good entertainment. But the main character is nasty, dope smoking, mean, cussing, coarse, etc., and not redeemable. In real life of course, she would have hit the bricks from the school system long before the first couple of scenes. This was an unusual role for Cameron who generally turns out to be one of our favorite people - someone we would like to befriend. There were a few good hilarious scenes like when she dry-humps Justin, her driving, a gym episode, and a few others; but overall this one will go from theaters to DVD in a matter of hours. This is kind of describing a girl with 'a nice personality' but chancey, and this movie has great stars but..."
4,A good comedy,"I just saw it in a theater today ($1 on Tuesdays for these second run films).I'd read the mixed reviews here on Amazon before I went and wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out I enjoyed it. Perfectly good way to pass 90 minutes of time. Certainly far more enjoyable than many other films I've had the misfortune of seeing.No, it's not going to be critically acclaimed nor go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time remembered by future generations. But I sure don't care. I just wanted an enjoyable comedy and this certainly gave me what I wanted.In addition to being funny, it was actually rather sweet how Diaz's character comes to finds that love is more important than money, falling in love with a low-paid teacher who will never give her the vast pile of cash she previously thought so vital.I can see why snobbish critics would dislike it. It's not dark, depressing, and so dull you'd like to shoot yourself just to get it over with."
1,Terrible,"This was one of the worst movies ever. The only good things about this movie is Jason Segel, and he only had a minor role."
2,Should be rated X,"First of all, to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep, realistic and taken seriously; don't. I don't believe it was meant to be taken seriously, however it's still not funny. Yea, it has a few giggle moments here & there but most of the scenes made no sense. Weak Plot. Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn't necessarily boring but simply not funny.The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana."
3,Bawdy and funny,Cameron Diaz is always entertaining. She is very funny in this movie. It is a little raunchy at times. This is a fun movie to watch.
3,Good but not great comedy,"Bad Teacher had all the makings of a great comedy. Great storyline, great cast but the funny moments just weren't funny enough to make this a great comedy. Justin Timberlake had a couple funny moments, otherwise, his character was a bit of a bore. Jason Segal had some good moments. Cameron Diaz was the typical materialistic, selfish hot girl. Phyllis Smith, who plays Lynn, was actually one of the funnier characters. Paired with Cameron Diaz they made a sort of oddball friendship that got some laughs from me. Overall, it was a good movie, just not as funny as I thought it would be or should have been. Any man out there that thinks Cameron Diaz is hot will most likely enjoy this movie for the car wash scene alone."
3,Leave you wanting,Not a bad movie; but I didn't care for the way it portrayed teachers in a bad light. At least in the end it turns that around. not a bad story over all but I couldn't rate it very highly.
4,"Different than I thought, but pleasantly so","I kinda thought this would be a kiddy/family movie. It IS NOT. Heavy drug and sex references throughout, but worth the time. Keep the kiddies in the other room though."
3,"Funny, but just didn't do it for me","This definitely has it's funny parts. It's not agonizing in any way to watch. But if you are expecting for it to end up being one of your all time favorite comedies, I hope you have pretty low standards. Cameron Diaz is pretty good in it and it makes you crack up because of how horrible she really is as a teacher. She does some incredibly messed up (in a funny way) things in this, but overall, it's not going to have you curled over laughing. But if you are looking to get it when it's on sale for 5 or 6 bucks, you will easily get your money's worth and also, dont' forget to enjoy the car wash scene ;)"
2,Funny? So-so.,"I was really surprised that some critic called this the funniest film of the year and how it was as funny asBridesmaids. I don't think so! Sure, this had a few funny parts but it was nowhere near as funny as ""Bridesmaids."" The main thing was that Diaz's character was despicable and, as a viewer, I had absolutely no compassion or concern for her, so that you don't root for her. I was hoping she would fail miserably, in fact. Not to say Lucy Punch's character was good either, but it just wasn't that good of a film. The best person/character in the film was (no surprise) Jason Segel. He had the best lines and part."
5,one of the best concerts I have ever bought!,Dudamel & Florez are real and great musicians! proud of their talent! Bravisimo for the two of them and the music selection is gorgeous....
3,An Easy Summer Read,"Being from Baltimore I am an Anne Tyler fan. She is amazingly talented in character development and pulling the reader into their mundane everyday lives. This book does not fall short of that, however it does lack in substance. Unlike some of her other books this will not challenge you to think or reflect over the story line. After finishing the book I didn't feel there was any real poignancy.It is an easy read that you won't have to expend a lot of energy on and it will keep your interest. I would recommend this for someone looking for something light and simple or someone looking for a nice book to read on vacation."
2,Disappointing - Anne Tyler Seems to Have Lost Her Joy,"I was most disappointed with this new book from Anne Tyler. And I would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she's lost her special gift. Her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor. (Who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower? Or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order. I could go on an on.) In her last few books, however,her characters have pretty much fallen flat. I fear that this change to more serious, humorless stories is a relection of her own life. It seems that since her husband died, her stories have suffered. I hope she will rediscover her old witty, truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters. I await her next book with great hope."
2,Disappointed,"If this book had not been required reading for my Book Club, and if it had not been short, I would have put it down as a waste of time, but I read it through, always hoping that there would be something to move me, or surprise me, or at least come to some sort of resolution, but it never happened. Yes, these are sketches of individuals relating to each other, but they are only mildly interesting, not thought-provoking."
3,A bit tedious.,"A good story but a bit tedious to read. Interesting insights on multi-culturalism in America, I just got bogged down a bit."
2,Spare Me the Binky Fairy,"As a multiculturalist, I seemed like a natural to enjoy Tyler's latest novel, which mixes the cultures of Americans, Iranians, and to some extent, Koreans in her story about two families who simultaneously adopt Korean orphans and in the process become friends. There's even a reference to my religious tradition, Unitarian Universalism. But the story, except for the plight of the American grandfather who loses his beloved wife to cancer, never really engaged me, and I got annoyed at the jarring change of perspective near the end from the adults to one of the Korean children--I surely hope I never meet the Binky Fairy."
2,Boring,"I am struggling to finish this book so I decided to read the reviews to see if there was any hope it might get better. I've got to say, I really don't understand the 5 star ratings. Really? You thought it was THAT good? It seems like the entire book revolves around them all getting together for parties all.the.time. I've read so many books which discuss people of different cultures existing in a foreign or native country, and they can be so extremely intriguing. This book, however, is just plain boring. *yawn* Maybe the problem I'm having with it is that the character POV changes so many times. And when it's Dave or Maryam, which is it seems it is a lot, I don't care really to hear what they have to say/think. Sorry, I don't recommend this one."
2,"Nice idea, so-so book","This book could have been so much better. I thought so much of the writing was trite and boring...some of it felt very awkward. Especially when the two extended families get together the scenes are very protracted and false-ringing. I did not feel touched by these characters, nor did the writing make me care about them, other than to be annoyed by Bitsy Donaldson and confused by Ziba. I think the idea was a good one, but it fails to deliver (in my opinion)."
3,"A Fair story, a bit boring","There are very few authors whose books I will buy as soon as they hit the shelves-- Anne Tyler is one of those. But as I read this book, I kept wondering if she actually wrote the story. Sorry, to think this way since I am a big fan of Ms. Tyler, but the writing just didn't seem to be up to her standards. The scene where the two different families meet for the first time at the airport where they're waiting for the Korean orphans they've adopted to arrive were filled with tedious details that were boring, and the author's step-by-step views of the characters were uninspiring. Overall I was disappointed in this story. I'm still a fan of Anne Tyler and when the time comes around again I'll probably read another story by this great author."
2,Most disappointing reading experience,"I adore Anne Tyler and have read all of her books several times. So, it was with great anticipation I bought her latest offering, Digging to America. However, it is with great disappointment I say to potential purchasers - forget it. Plodding, boring, poor characterisation and - dare I say it? -this book is badly written. As another Amazon reviewer so cleverly put it, it feels as if it was written by a ghost writer.Our book club meets next week to discuss it and I know it will be such a disappointment for the group."
2,novel where nothing happens,"I finished this book because I was urged to by people who had read and loved it, but the reason why is still beyond me. Nothing much happens in this book except a series of suburban dinner parties. Since there is no plot, some strength of characterization should have been necessary, but none of the characters are engaging and we don't get to know them very well. There are some sentences and scenes which are good and amusing descriptions of people's thoughts and conversations, but that's not enough to carry a book which was conceived without much in the way of content."
3,Left me still thinking after I read it....,"Interesting book especially as it relates to the Iranian (Middle East) culture, which was not the point of the book. Having had a good friend who is a (Christian) Iranian, we had learned much about his culture. Reading this book brought back fond memories of our friendship with him. Interesting characters, both American and Iranian. Nothing much dramatic happens in the book though, but a gentle and quick read."
4,Good book,"Digging to America by Anne Tyler is a most enjoyable read. Our book club is usually into heavy stuff, and it was delightful to read something that wasn't a ""downer.""Anne Tyler writes simply and directly. She can capture a scene and emotion with few, articulate, well chosen words. I laughed out loud at the binky party.The main character is really Maryam who is searching for ""belonging"" as is almost everybody else in the book.You'll enjoy this book, It's not a GREAT book, but one that can generate some good discussion."
1,Someone's gotten lazy!,"This book is to literature as paint-by-numbers is to art. Everything that happens is predictable and trite. It's populated less by characters than by caricatures. Even their names are ridiculous - ""Bitsy""; ""Linwood""? Really?"
1,A book of stereotypes and cliches,"This book is poorly researched and based on cliches and stereotypes about adoption and international adoption. Like all Anne Tyler books, the characters are interesting and quirky. However, the author's understanding of international adoption, or rather her lack of understanding, is obvious. It is clear this is an outsider's view and that she is looking in with some disdain. The most disturbing part of the book for me was that it seemed that the author didn't like two of the three children in the novel - she continually described their personalities, and even their appearance (particularly their Asian features) in disparaging terms. As a parent of two children adopted internationally, I was keen to read this book but once I started it I couldn't wait to finish it and put it away for good because it was so awful. The only reason I finished it was so that I could tell others why they shouldn't waste their time on it."
1,boring,I made the mistake of buying two copies. One for my friend to read on vacation and the other for myself. We both disliked the book. I was very suprised a Pulitzer winning author wrote this story. We both had a really difficult time finishing it! Very disappointing....
1,Boring,"I have to rank this with the top ten most boring books I have ever read. It's my first Anne Tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books. The characters in this book were so uninteresting. I couldn't connect with one character. Practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party. After the first party I pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture! The underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book, but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears."
1,from adoptive mom,"You can tell Tyler is neither an adoptive parent or good researcher; she uses language that many adoptive parents consider offensive. Examples: Calling bio parents the ""real"" parents and saying adopted kids are not adoptive parents ""own"" kids, plus implying that all adoptive parents are ""barren"" (a nasty word and not true). Also, the arrival day is not her invention, as the publisher says, but common among parents of foreign-born. There are MUCH better books out there about adoption."
5,Anne Tyler's Latest,I purchased this book for a Reader's Guild discussion group at Goucher College. It's a very quick read about first generation immigrants adjusting to America and Americans as well as great fun to read about places in Baltimore which are described so beautifully.
4,Anything by Anne Tyler,"I admit, I love Anne Tyler's works. Some are great...some not so great...but she captures my interest in every book and keeps those pages turning. This is another of her stories filled with very interesting characters who live ordinary lives . As usual she has a way of bringing the reader into their world and into their hearts and she does it beautifully with simplicity and brevity."
5,Anne Tyler at her Best,"I bought this book because I've enjoyed all of Tyler's novels and wanted to read her newest. What a surprise to find out it was about Korean adoption - when I have also adopted two Korean children. Tyler has done it again - written about quirky people that you realize you either know, love, or are!! What insight!!"
4,Another nice entry by Tyler,"In Anne Tyler's latest, two couples who don't know each other arrive at the Baltimore airport to meet their newly adopted baby daughters from Korea. The two couples, joined by this experience, become friends. The Donaldsons are all-American, and the Yazdans, Iranian-American. The plot involves the Yazdan's mother Maryam, who came to the United States as a young woman, and her difficulties with feeling like an immigrant throughout her life -- never quite at home in her adopted country.Tyler writes beautifully about finding love again in old age, which is not often addressed very adeptly. She also captures the emigrant experience very sensitively and humorously.If you like Tyler's work, this one won't dissapoint."
1,Most boring book I've ever trudged through,"I have no idea why this book was written, nothing of any interest happens, the characters.. who cares about them. Pointless, I kept hoping it would get better, what a borefest. Watch grass grow, it's time better spent."
2,"Great writer, but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book","I've read every Anne Tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable.But this one (I haven't finished it yet) isn't very compelling. A week or more goes by before I pick it up and I think I'm just going to have to set aside a few hours and ""get it out of the way"" which is a horrible thing to say about a writer I enjoy so much.Neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me -- just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes. The characters--her strong point--seem flat and without a strong plot to move things along...it just ain't moving along."
2,Not what I expected,"I read Digging to America because it received so many rave reviews. I just finished it and found it to be rather boring and poorly written. There was no continuous thread that kept my interest; I found myself wondering if I had skipped some pages because the story seemed so disjointed. Also, beginning in Chapter 9, why the sudden change from: ""Bitsy did . . ."" to ""Jin-Ho's mother did . . ."" and so on. I didn't get that at all and found it annoying. Maybe I'm missing something??"
3,A disappointed Anne Tyler fan,"There are very few authors whose books I will buy in hardcover as soon as they hit the shelves-- Anne Tyler is one of those. But as I read this book, I kept wondering who her ghost rider was. It was amateurishly written (heresy, I know, to say about Anne Tyler) and the book failed to engage me from beginning to end. The character development was rather sketchy and there really wasn't one character (with the possible exception of Grandpa Dave) who I cared about. Actually, the book was rather boring and I found myself looking forward to the end so I could get on with another read. I would be very interested to see what other readers think, but for me, this book was a disappointment."
2,"Off to a good start, but then...","After ""The Amateur Marriage"" I swore I wasn't reading anymore Anne Tyler, but someone said this was good. The final 50 or so pages were deadly dull, repeticious and predictable. And one chapter was from the point of view of a four-year-old! Please, spare me. I finished this book just so I could say fairly that I thought it was a dud.Who was this book about? There were too many characters and most of them were underdeveloped. Plus too many details. How many times did we have to know that Maryam took care of Susan? How many idiotic family gatherings did I have to witness?The girls' adoption sets this story in motion, then it goes nowhere. I didn't believe for a minute that Maryam cared about Dave. Toward the end there were pages and pages explaining Maryam. Tyler should have used all that background herself to write an interesting character instead of explaining it all to us."
3,Tyler Fans Will Enjoy,"As an adopted girl myself I was fascinated with the storyline in DIGGING TO AMERICA. However, I found Tyler's ""take"" on adoption a little off. The only character I thought accurately portrayed adoptive reality was the Donaldson baby who grew up to hate the ""arrival party"" and just wanted to be treated like a normal kid. While I think the sentiment behind the arrival party is very sweet, the statement that the child just wanted to be treated as a regular kid spoke stronger about what her life in America will be.Tyler attempts to relate what it's like to be an outsider in America with both an adoption storyline and a ""naturalized citizen"" storyline. I'm not sure she succeeds at either, but instead creates memorable characters, full of flaws, who are not right all the time and yet not the bad guys either. This is the key to a Tyler book and what we most appreciate about her. For that reason, Tyler fans will enjoy DIGGING TO AMERICA."
1,Shallow and uninspiring,"I enjoy Anne Tyler's work, but found this story shallow and uninspiring. My husband and I adopted a precious baby daughter from Korea many years ago, and I expected to find at least a few shared experiences. What a disappointment! I was unable to connect with any of these characters in any way and found the story completely lacking in credibility. Bitsy's attempt to preserve Jin-Ho's cultural roots was pathetic -- without sensitivity or understanding. How could anyone be that clueless!"
5,book Digging to america,The book arrived in perfect condition. I like dealing with the Amazon company!!!!
2,B - O - R - I - N - G,Wow. I don't even know what to say. The book went no where. I was so disappointed.
2,So this is Anne Tyler...,"Never read one of her books before and the reviews on this one sounded good and the premise intriguing so I took a chance. Not good. I can understand why women like her work, as they get all the good parts and good lines while the men are consigned to secondary roles and are total wimps. (When a hurrican strikes and the neighborhood is blacked out and covered with fallen trees, none of the male characters goes out to buy, rent or borrow a chain saw and clear it up -- everyone just waits around dumbly and passively to be rescued). Serviceable prose and the occasional zinger of characterization save this from one star doom."
3,Anne Tyler was Digging,"Ms. Tyler has written terrific books that hold your interest from the beginning to the end but in ""Digging to America"" I was bored. Her characters never grabbed you. I found myself hoping that one of them would do something that I cared about. Maryam's relationship with Dave and how she coped with the many different levels of feelings she experienced was the highlight of the book.d"
1,Boring as Sin,"Nothing exciting happens in this book. The self-conscious word play and descriptive language amount to a hill of beans.And the cover seems inaccurate: the Asian girl holding up the flowers looks to come from North Korea or China, where that kind of Communist-era uniform and haircut are common, not from South Korea.I'm sure there are better books about the experience of Korean orphans who get adopted into American families. And I suggest ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" if you want a vivid account of someone who lived in Iran and the USA.I usually like Anne Tyler's books, but this one put me to sleep night after night. I kept counting the pages to go until it was over and I could move onto something exciting and worthwhile."
2,Characters In Search of a Plot,"As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn't feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience."
3,Kept waiting for it to get better,I thought this book had such potential. I found the characters interesting but the book didn't really go anywhere. I kept waiting for a turn but it just never happened. I really enjoyed learning about the Iranian culture and it opened my understanding to how those born in a different country can feel in regards to Americans. I could relate to Maryam and to Dave at the same time. I completely empathized with the family members who didn't want to be dragged to yet another family celebration.Not her best but I'm still glad I read it.
2,A Great Disappointment Considering......,"I loved ""Back When We Were Grown-Up,"" and expected to really enjoy this, as well. Unfortunately, this was not the case! Enough with the Airport Celebrations -- how many do we need to get the picture?? I don't wish to ruin the read for others. however, I can state that I would have preferred a different path for certain characters. I liked many of Tyler's characters here, but this book & I just didn't click!! I guess I was hoping to encounter another Rebecca from her previous book [already mentioned]."
2,This Book is Boring,"I have not read any previous Ann Tyler novels and I might have made a mistake by starting with this one. I love to read and feel I am not an overly critical reviewer but I expect to be entertained, informed or both. This novel is just plain repetitive and boring.I strongly urge readers, if they feel compelled to buy it, to wait for the paperback. This book went on and on about ""Arrival day"", the day the girls arrived at the airport from Korea. If I heard one more silly reference to the characters singing ""She'll be Coming Round the Mountain"" I was going to gag.I did give it two stars because I finished it."
1,Datalogging! (if you buy the $200 software),Shouldn't this include the software if it's advertised as a datalogging. All of Extech's datalogging meters come with software.
5,Come Join The Circle,This is an excellent collection of songs. I work at both a public Montessori school and a traditional public school and I have been able to use this CD for both. I highly recommend it!
3,Indulge Your Sweet Tooth,"These are the kind of quaint, cotton-candy numbers that tin-pan-alley tunesmiths cranked out for the AM-radio teen idols of the sixties and seventies. Though the individual songs vary in quality, the CD as a whole provides the perfect soundtrack for a kid's poolside tea party in sunny California, complete with marble-eyed stuffed animals, kaleidoscope pinwheels, and red Kool Aid. When I was super tiny, I spent enough time sitting on the vinyl back seats of my mom's LTD Ford daydreaming to twee pop like this for it to leave an impression. It's fluff, but it's a sweet taste."
5,CLASSIC FUN AND VERY CATCHY SONGS!,"This collection is perfect for those seeking the lighter side of 60s pop rock with an emphasis on sing-along-choruses and VERY catchy hooks! This is actually one of the better compilations of 60s songs I've run across. I don't understand the negative comments of the other reviewers. What did they expect getting a CD called ""A Whole Lot of Rainbows""? To actually criticize it for being too light is to miss the whole point! My only possible complaint with this CD is that the song order should be different and the overall effect would thus be more effective. Some of the best songs are in the middle. Still, this is HIGHLY recommended if you're looking for giddy 60s songs that sound like they should have been all over the radio!"
3,"Silly, Refreshing Fun","Not enough songwriting or musicianship to make this more than 3 stars, but it is fun. All tracks from '66-'68.These songs make The Beatles sound like Black Sabbath."
1,This album explains a lot,"I now realise why Aussie acts hardly troubled the international market. With a few exceptions, this was a collection of second rate covers or ho-hum originals with third rate production values."
5,Something is not right,This paper in pdf format is available free of charge on the Costa Rican Scielo web site. It should be noted that the Costa Rican species differ from ours in the Amazon basin.
3,Misrepresentative reviews and product advertising,"Recently I purchased the Gnostic Bible Audio CD set.Most reviews relate to the Gnostic Bible in written form, misrepresenting the product Amazon purports to sell, which is an audiobook.I am disappointed and feel cheated by Shambhala, which has madesuch a valuable contribution to my learning for over 30 years because:1. While it is a fine recording (and hence 2 rating points), they are only selections, not complete recordings as the cover implies.2. The blurb also suggested there was a written copy of the Gnostic gospels inside. Alas i found essays on Gnosticism, which, though edifying were not what the advertising suggested.Nick TheophilouMelbourne, Australia"
5,The Gnostic Bible,A very good one-in-all book for ALL the gnostic books. Great for studying and comparing them all in one book.A good translation.
2,GNOSTIC BIBLE,"THIS BOOK WAS INFORMATIVE BUT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED. I WANTED A COPY OF THE GNOSTIC BIBLE, THIS BOOK IS ABOUT HOW THE GNOSTIC BIBLE CAME TO BE AND ITS HISTORY."
4,Gnostic Texts of Mystical Wisdom,"The editors of this volume are presenting these texts as sacred books and sacred scripture of the gnostics, and collectively as sacred literature of the gnostics. But in this Bible of the gnostics there is no sense of a single, authoritative collection. The sacred literature in this Bible illustrates a diversity that is suggestive of the character of gnostic religions. Further, the sacred literature in this Bible constitutes no closed canon. They present here what they have judged to be the most significant gnostic texts, but there are other gnostic writings that have not been included. All these gnostic texts may be equally authoritative, truths may be discovered in a variety of texts and traditions, and the way to wisdom and knowledge cannot be closed. Such a sense of wisdom and knowledge has made this sacred literature attractive to free spirits in the past and equally fascinating to many in the present."
2,The actual book is great....the audio is another story...,"I have yet to read the book, as I have only listened to the audio version. I was very disappointed in the choice of narrators as the two men had a speaking style that was, to be quite honest, monotone. As I purchased the audio version to have something to listen to while at work, I was sorely disappointed by the reading style of the two male narrators. The woman who was featured very early in the narration disappeared at some point, and I really wish she had been chosen to read the entire text, as her voice was far superior to those of the other two. It was very disappointing as this is a topic I am greatly fascinated in. I would only recommend the audio version of this book if you are having difficulty going to sleep."
3,not what I thought,"the ""book"" included is just like a review, not the actual gospels. the CD's are good though so It is kind of worth it."
2,Not good for external use,"I purchased this item for remote (wireless non CLS) flash(manual). Modeling light and 1/3 power increments make it attractive to use in manual mode. While these features work fine there is a major flaw. The unit has an auto turn off feature that can't be turned off (pressing the test button will reactivate the flash). Obviously that make it not suitable for remote flash work. Also, in case you are wondering, the unit min power is 1/64 (I was hoping for 1/128)."
4,Great flash low price,"It works almost as good as my SB-800, most of the time. But there are couple of flaws... There is no menu or more intuitive control like SB800, Flash power is not quite consistant sometimes, no built-in bounce card, doesn't come with color gel, and wireless TTL is sometimes a pain to sync up with the camera. But for $200 less than SB800, I can adjust."
1,A Flash before the D60's time,"This Flash is before it's time or should I say before the Nikon D60's time.I purchased this flash to use with my Nikon D60 and it did not work with the D60. The D60 is a new model Nikon and and the Sigma EF was produced before the D60. The problem is the electronics in the D60 are different from the D40's and the earlier models of Nikon DSLR's.Check out the Sigma website and check the model Nikon's that are listed on the website and you will see that the D60 is not listed, because the Sigma EF's electronics are different which will not allow the camera to communicate with the Sigma EF correctly.I returned the Sigma EF and purchased the Nikon SB-600. So save your time and money and purchase a true Nikon for a Nikon."
5,Acne Eliminator,"I tried many other remedies ,both prescribed and over the counter,and Face Doctor was the only one that clleared my acne .I can't extoll it high enough."
1,Did Not Work for Rosacea,"I have had rosacea with a great deal of redness for several years. I purchased this product thinking it might help reduce my facial ruddiness. I have gone through nearly a bar using the soap as directed everyday. I tried to use it twice a day but it dried my face too much and made it itchier so I went to once a day, before bed.My pores seemed to shrink somewhat but the redness was not reduced at all. I am very disappointed with this product. It did not deliver what it promised."
3,Decent Face Wash,"I have always had problems with acne and I bought this product because I heard that it contained seabuckthorn oil. This product does an ""okay"" job making sure my acne doesn't go completely out of control, but I've had much more success with 10% benzoyl peroxide washes in the past. I've been using this product for about 4 weeks now."
2,Tuning too sticky,Tuning was too sticky and spongy for my taste. I only use AM so I cannot speak to the FM performance.
2,Not for a younger crowd,"This is a book that only contains game sheets, no writing or suggestions. The games are for a mostly older crowd. I'm 21, and most of the games involve questions that if you haven't been around long enough could not be very easy for example One game called famous couples your supposed to write in names of partner some people listed: George burns, Napoleon Bonaparte, Laura Ingalls. Some good Ideas for games but not for a younger group of people. I think I will only use one game out of the 8 listed."
1,Very boring,"A woman speaks during the whole video, there are no other image except her face. It would be better to record it on an audio cassette."
5,Love these Cambodian stories!,Another fine example from a fine movie director who happens to be a King in real life. Perhaps Royals from other countries should stop what they are doing and film stories from their kingdoms so we all can enjoy them as I enjoyed this movie.
5,Playboy's Girlfriends,"Girlfriends is one of the best Playboy video ever made, period. Vanessa Gleason in the ""chapter"" named Country Clean in amazing; she does another scene which involves water just like she did in the Sep. issue of Playboy. Kelly Monaco is hot in the Olivia's Closet ""chapter"". The best ""chapter"" in the DVD of Girlfriends is without a doubt the one with Monica Mendez and Shellani R. Taarud entitle Stormy Sunday; the ""chapter"" Slumber Party also have some hot moments. The only two let-downs are the ""chapter"" Summer Lust and the fact that there is never a scene with Laura Cover & Vanessa Gleason, like the one sugested on the Girlfriends cover but overall the Girlfiends DVD video is an A."
2,SUCKS!,"I must say there are some very beautiful women in this one, but overall it's a waste of money. After viewing this one I'm quite cautious about buying any other DVDs from Playboy. The picture quality is equal to that of VHS, which means you can't pause your favorite scene without some fuzziness to compliment it. Plus, the length of time spent on the most erotic scenes is very minimal. My personal opinion, don't buy it. Your better off with a magazine!"
1,"dull, dull, dull","One decent dyke scenario doesn't make this one worth the money. You're going to stay pretty soft on your armchair, even though there are some way pretty girls on this one. I tremble with excitement just thinking about the kind of performance that PB's arch rival Penthouse could have gotten from a gorgeous big-breasted blonde like Laura Cover. She'd have been so hot in a real depiction of sapphic sex."
2,Very few Playmates,"I thought this DVD was a pretty big disappointment. It promised a lot in terms of girl-girl action but delivered very little. Also there were only about three Playboy Playmates in the DVD. The only worthwhile segment, and it's a good one (reason for two stars) is ""Olivia's Closet"" , a very sexy story starring Playboy Playmate Kelly Monaco. It was fun, sexy and Kelly simply looks amazing. As for the other segments, they are pretty boring."
3,All very pretty but little heat...,"When is Playboy going to wake up and realize that it's 1999? The women are for the most part quite pretty, but this video, like most Playboy efforts over the past two years, just doesn't go far enough. The performances are tame to say the least."
2,somewhat let down,"I expected more. Some of the girls were hot, but most of them just did not live up too Playboy Quality. It was just too cute at times. I was hoping for some more girl on girl action, maybe a little tonge action, but it was just not there. Save your money and do not buy."
5,Beautiful Women!,"This is a great video if you want to see beautiful women, hug, kiss, lick and caress each other. It works for me!"
3,Beuatiful girls in tame scenarios,"Playboy needs to push the limits on its Girl-Girl productions, especially in videos with performances from Playmates of the month. The Lesbian performances in this one are nice enough but way tame compared to an average Penthouse video, and the lesbian sex is only hinted at whenever Playmates are involved. Alot of readers of the magazine would just melt at the chance to see some of the delectable girls who appeared in its pages have sex with each other in a video. Is there something in their contracts preventing this? Playboy may be concerned with preserving the Playmates' ""girl next door"" auras, but they gotta realize in the nineties, girls can jump the girl next door! How about a video devoted to Playmates with Playmates? Laura and Vanessa getting really down and dirty, and their friends."
3,Could have been a LOT better!,"One of the other reviewers said something about how PENTHOUSE could have REALLY made this a hot video, and they're absolutely right! PLAYBOY just doesn't have the girl-girl thing down very well yet, and it's too bad because they've got the best-looking women! Still, this is one of their better efforts!"
1,Fasten Your Belt,"A person would have to be high on drugs to even listen to this so-called ""music"".Absolutely Terrible!!"
3,Steady beats,"This is the first Ellen Allien cd I bought (since it was the cheapest lol) But I am familiar with her other work. I would definitly say this isn't her best, but it really is not bad either. Ultimately this has a steady beat, and doesn't really drop you. Like the other guy before me, I really liked Modeselektor's song on this. What I got from listening to this cd straight through, is that I felt like it could have been taken a bit further, especially since I know the kind of straight up german techno Ellen can produce. But for the price I paid (couple dollars) I would recommend it if your already buying some other stuff, that way it can ""tag"" along with your other shipments."
1,Byzantium,"This book possibly expresses the author's thoughts, even understanding, with some accuracy. But to someone who is not already familiar with the point-of-view being expressed it is totally useless. It is easy enough to claim some sort of affiliation with Ramana Maharshi, but presenting the view of reality that Ramana enjoyed, described and promoted is a different matter altogether. This writer seems to relish riddle mongering. He assumes an air of authority, of greatly superior wisdom and insight, but anyone accustomed to reading the prose of genuine essayists, like George Orwell, for example, will find this writing similar to an act of sexual intercourse where one of the participants is entirely imaginary."
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this book after experiencing a problem with one of my dogs. Because of the reputation of the authors, I assumed (wrongly) that this would be a helpful book. The book seems to be a real cut and paste effort from previous works. It is disjointed and offers the reader no real tools to work with. Worse than that, I foresee someone depending on this book rather than getting professional assistance with this potentially dangerous situation. I was disappointed that these two 'experts' in dog training had nothing better to offer. Save your money, I wish I had."
1,Nothing new here,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I have read a couple other books on general dog training, and this one offered absolutely nothing new above what I had seen before. The case studies presented about dogs retrained at the author's institute struck me as nothing more than a blatant advertisement. If you have no experience with dog training whatsoever, then maybe you will find this book useful. But if you already have some knowledge of basic training and are looking for some advanced insight and more effective ways to deal with canine aggression, save your money. The information here is too superficial."
4,GRRR!,This had a lot of practical good information about dealing with aggressive behavior in dogs. I would recommend it definately.
4,Worth the money,"I had to purchase this book for an online class at National University. I thought the book was good, easy to read and informative. It was actually one of the few books that I did not sell back. It covered a variety of questions especially for the ""new teacher"" or someone thinking about teaching."
4,Ask The Teacher Review,"Depending on the school, course, and professor you may be required or suggested to pick up Mark Ryan's Ask the Teacher. Regardless of being a parent, credential student, or present teacher Ask The Teacher is a good guide and outline to many of today's questions for those involved in education. Ryan provides answers and strategies to a range of questions from classroom environments, truancies, and testing.While some suggestions and ideas may seem difficult to implement their inclusion is important because it shows where we should be and what we can do. Keep in mind some suggestions are difficult to implement based on time and economic reasons and keep an open mind while reading Ryan and you will get more out of Ask The Teacher then you plan. Overall it is a good guide for anyone looking at the teaching professor and provides parents a good question bank to ask teachers if they are concerned about their child's education."
2,Buy it only if you ned to,"I had to buy this book for National University's online course. I really like national University and wish they would have chosen another textbook.I was not impressed with the information inside. Ryan does a question and answer format that briefly synopsis very important topics in education. Sometimes when I read a topic, I am really disappointed that a topic that has had a great deal of reseacrh is presented by Ryan in a half page.He wholeheartedly attempts to sell the reader on bilingual education which I disagree. There are other topics that he discusses with what I feel is a liberal point of view.The main point that I was taken back by is the fact that Ryan's end-of-chapter bibliographies include research that is sometimes dated. His sources are sometime 6-8 years old or older."
2,Biased writer,"This book was required for one of my courses while earning my teacher certification. I noticed that the author works at my university so I'm not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended. The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education. To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles. It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a ""guide on the side"". My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn't good. When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt. Don't become another victim of teacher certification indoctrination like this author is."
1,Lower level reading,"I think that this is a great book for a middle- or high-school student as introductory material, but it is not appropriate for college or graduate students!I don't claim to be an expert on education but when a book is so vague (lacks details), quotes out-dated studies, and discusses irrelevant subjects as this book does, I just can't take it. I am sure the author is a nice person and kudos for writing a book, but the fact that professors are having their students read this book as ""required"" reading makes me re-think my school of choice!Try it out at the library before you buy it."
3,great condition,I ordered this book and received it but it took Amazon around 3 weeks to ship out...I wasn't happy about that because I needed it for a class. I had purchased it 2 weeks before my class started. Usually Amazon always delivers fast...but not this time. The product itself was perfect.
4,A great reference book for any new teacher,"I am in the National credential program as well and I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it was required for a class but I have almost completed this program, and this book was by far my favorite. It is a must for any teacher, young or old. I really enjoyed the question and answer format of this book as I think Ryan does a great job of covering many aspects in the education world we live in today."
5,User Friendly,"I bought this book because I had to have it for a class, but I have used it so much in actual teaching. I have used this book in several of my classes, and I have used it to trouble shoot problems with my own students. It is extremely user friendly, and I would recommend buying it."
1,useless book,"This book is only required for class because its written by a National University teacher. It contains THEORIES of evolution, which do not stand up against scientific design. It is simply an editorial for liberal political ideology and is useless for any factual evidence or value."
5,Ask the Teacher: A Practitioner's Guide to Teaching and Learning in the Classroom,"The question and answer format of this book makes the information very easy to access. The information is both relevant and extremely helpful for credential students, teachers and parents. I have used this book as a reference in many of my credential classes. It always comes in as a useful resource. I have also used it to answer questions I have as a parent, in regards to my child's learning and education."
4,worthwhile,"I purchased this book for a teacher credentialing course and have found it to be a valuable resource. I am currently enrolled in a Masters program and still find the book useful and relevant. I was fortunate enough to have Mark Ryan as a teacher and found him to be extremely thorough, attentive to his students needs and insightful."
5,Ask The Teacher: A Practitioner's Guide to Teaching and Learning in the Diverse Classroom (2nd Edition),"The format of this book make it simple to understand and also very clear for educators to read. It also offers great content and even gives amazing ideas to use in the classroom. During my credential course, I used this book and it coincided with my teaching in the clasroom and also with the learning atmosphere through my course."
1,Liberal Propaganda,I am required to read this to become a teacher. I have just begun to read it and it turns my stomach. It has some very crazy stuff in it. No wonder our education system is broken.The book did arrive promptly.
4,Very Practical,"I am a secondary History and Spanish teacher and have almost completed my Master's in Education. This is one textbook that I actually enjoyed reading and quite honestly in my teaching education, there have only been a handful of enjoyable textbooks. ""Ask the Teacher"" is practical, clear cut, to the point and not filled with the usual turn off of boring language. I particularly enjoyed how it had a different format than the traditional textbook as it is in a Q & A format. This is what sets it apart from the usual monotonous textbook. It is more of a guide and a ""handbook"" to teaching. I enjoyed Ryan's useful tips and use them in my classroom. I also have had the pleasure of taking a separate class (not with this particular book) from Mark Ryan and can attest that he is an incredibly knowledgeable and down-to-earth educator."
5,Great tool to have!,I purchased this book for my class and it provided me with easy referencing on the diversity of student learning and will keep this book in my student/teacher library!
4,Review for Ask the Teacher,I had the opportunity to read this book during my credential program at National and enjoyed taking a class with Mark Ryan online. The author supports an inclusive approach to education and drives home the point that tracking is separate but equal in disguise. I recommend this book for understanding arguments in favor of an inclusive approach to education and from this perspective answers to a variety of pertinent questions or issues that educators will face in their teaching. It is written in an easy to read format and is not too technical. If you are looking for an easy read and an introduction to an inclusive approach to education then this is one book worth reading.
5,Great book!,"This was an amazing book. As a language teacher native to Costa Rica, this book helped me to understand many aspects of American education and the challenges of teaching todays diverse population. I am glad I bought this book and I believe every teacher should read it."
4,Good Resource for Teachers,I purchased this book for my teacher credentialing program. This book was very informative and an resource I will use once I get into the classroom. The question and answer format of the text is helpful and clearly lays out the information as easy to read.
5,A must have guide for any teacher in any realm,"This book is one of my favorite textbooks in my education as a teacher. It is composed in a question and answer format, strategically divided into units where any teacher in any field would find these topics in their classroom. I've taught in a correctional facility where my students were culturally diverse and this guide has helped me in my teachings and as a student."
3,Long Live Crazy Horse,"Crazy Horse is an underrated band. This album was the only one released by the current Crazy Horse lineup on their own, and it is great. ""Thunder and Lightning"" is a good rocker."
5,very complete and concise,"This is the best pregnancy book around.. I looked high and low to find the book that had everything...facts, personal stories of the author ( who has eight children of his own ), diagrams, and a monthly personal journal with questions, and a place to jot down your thoughts and concerns, along with a place to include pregnancy photos. When I found this book, I couldn't wait to read every word of it. I recommend it to everyone I know who is pregnant."
2,Just OK,"I found this book to be 'just OK.' It was published in the 90's and is therefore, fairly outdated. Also, I didn't like how the weeks were referred to in gestational age (two weeks less than how your OB dates your pregnancy). I found this to be confusing and somewhat annoying. Also, most of the information was somewhat basic (nothing I hadn't encountered before)."
3,"good resource, but I didn't like the attitude","This book had lots of good info (but not much more than any of the other pregnancy ""bibles"" out there), but I found the Sears' attitude to be annoying and patronizing. I found the portion about how labor should not be painful (great pressure, not pain ? ) to be semantic nonsense, and I felt that their attitude was basically ""if you have great pain, it's your fault"". I think it's just a new twist on the demeaning attitudes that society had for women who couldn't quietly muddle through childbirth without unduly upsetting anyone else"
5,The Pregnancy Book: Month by Month,I have given this book as a gift on several different occasions and always get compliments from the moms to be. They like the organization of the book and either read ahead to see what's coming or stay right where they are in their pregnancy.
4,"Great book for a month by month ""blow by blow""","This book is great. I really like that it is not wordy, all information in it is pertinent. It is also quite easy to use... there have been several times which my wife and I have used the book to uncover what her new mysterious pain was BEFORE we call the doctor and end up paying for unnecessary doctor visits. This book is very good for the inqusitive pregnant folks out there. If it is your first pregnancy, all of your friends and family will have advise and many times, that advise will not be the best advise. This book will have sound advise coming from experts in pregnancy.I will definately be buying more ""Sears"" series of books."
2,Outdated by many years,"I bought this book because of the excellent reviews, only to be quite disappointed when I received it. What I didn't notice was the dates on the reviews, nor the date of publication, which are booth over 10 years old. This book came out 15 years ago, and the information given is widely inaccurate. For example, the information that this book states occurs during the second month of pregnancy is off by a week each.The photos are all black and white and incorrect for the time frame. The whole feel of this book is the 80's in fact. I am sure that back in 1997 when this book came out is was indeed a wonderful book, but with more modern technology and research, this book is beyond it's time and not very helpful for someone who is currently pregnant. The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy is a far better and updated book. [...]"
2,Save your money for a better book...,"This book is outdated, so you have to add a couple of weeks to whatever week it says you're on. Also, it doesn't give much information in general. I wished I hadn't bought it and ended up using (and loving) the Mayo Clinic's guide to pregnancy."
5,"Get this book instead of ""What to Expect...""","This book was a fabulous resource. I got it after reading ""What to Expect When You Are Expecting"" and being very disappointed with the information given there. The Searses have lots of good information about what is actually happening to your body during pregnancy and why it happens. They spend much less time focusing on things that can go wrong in a very small percentage of pregnancies and instead give lots of good general information. This book prompted lots of good question and answer sessions with my doctor. I would recommend this book to any parent to be who wants to know what is going on physically and emotionally during pregnancy. This book also has some great tips on treating illness without drugs during pregnancy."
2,Ponderous to read and lacking concrete information,"I really didn't like this book. I bought this and what to expect when you are expecting. I prefered the other. I found this lacking in concrete developmental info about the fetus. There were too many ""write in questions"" and personal anicdotes and not enough facts. I will probably sell this book in my yard sale or send it to goodwill as I really didn't find it helpful at all."
5,Great amount of Info,"This book has been the most helpful, though I didn't get it until 1/2 way through my pregnancy so I don't know much about the early info. The month by month format can be helpful, but is also less organized that way. Don't try to read about your month in one sitting or you'll be on information overload! There is some bias, especially regarding labor and delivery, but still very helpful. Great resource for your first pregnancy."
5,"Best overall pregnancy book , month by month","The Sears have a gaggle of their own children, medical expertise, and excellent, down-to-earth advice for new moms and dads. When we first got pregnant EVERYONE told us to get 'What to Expect', and we were horrified by such an alarmist book. Then one of our more enlightened friends recommended this book, and I now buy/lend it to all our newly pregnant friends! It is worlds better than any other American-authored book on pregnancy. Can they be preachy at times, for example about co-sleeping? Sure, but like one must do when pregnant or embarking on any new adventure, you take the advice that works for you. Also great by the Sears is The Baby Book - the only we have had for our now almost 2-yr old son. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Other favorites include any book by British author Sheila Kitzinger."
2,"Average, Just Average!!!","One of the very first books I bought. I read it for a couple of days, it answered SOME of my many questions. I retired this book as soon as I got to put my hands on to ""What to Expect When Expecting"" and ""The Pregnancy Book"" has been collecting dust ever since. It has a very poor outline of pregnancy,it only covers the common sense subjects on pregnancy while ""What to Expect"" will touch on subjects you would even think to ask. If this book was recommended to you, be sure to get other three or four books to answer all the other questions that this book will leave you wondering about."
4,The Sears Parenting Library books are excellent.,"The Sears have 8 children and are both medical professionals. They have so much experience and wisdom to share. All of their books are easy to read and cover the most common issues. The information in this book is concise and clearly explained. It helps you understand what's happening month-by-month. I would follow this one up with the Sears Breastfeeding Book, The Baby Book and The No-Cry Sleep Solution. This set would make a wonderful library for expecting and new parents."
4,"Good info, but a bit unrealistic","Overall this book is useful and informative. However, there are times when it is a little unrealistic and seems to oversimplify things. For example, in the first month the author indicates that it is best to just not set an alarm to wake up naturally since you may need more rest. Somehow I don't think that my employer would agree with this option! They make it sound like for nine months, the only thing that is occuring in your life is pregnancy. The whole book isn't like that, but it is an overall tone. I have used it throughout my pregnancy so far, but if I had it to do over again, I would save my money and go back to the old stand by, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting."""
1,Disappointing,"This book was disappointing, it contained no information that isn't available in every other pregnancy book. Worse, I found it to be condescending and biased. The indication throughout was that if you didn't agree with their specific, medicalized, and fear-based opinions, you are a foolish mother who does not care about her children. I prefer books that present well-balanced information and options, with fact based pros and cons."
3,"ok book, there are better ones out there","This book is just ok, it covers many things well and if you dont know anything about having a baby this may be a good book for you. This book takes no stand on any ""right"" way of doing things. Each topic seems to end with ""it (the problem/issue) is probably ok, but maybe it isnt, so you had better call your doctor"". So really, I could have saved my money and just picked up the phone and called the doctors office if I had a question, because ultimatly that is what the book is going to end up telling me anyway!"
5,Orgasmic,"This CD practically lives in my CD player... probably one of the best, if not THE best progressive trance mixes I've ever heard.. the tracks from X Cabs and De Niro are simply amazing, with 10 and 11 being the best tracks on the CD. Don't even hesitate to buy this one."
5,Trancitional!,"This is one of the best deep thumping, soulful- trance mixes available today. Christopher Lawrence has the uncanny knack of perpetually keeping the listener in a paradoxically mood- altered state where one feels calm and frenzied at the same time. The loops, beats, tweaks and cosmic tunes layered one above the other in a 5 dimensional plot(sound, beat, melody, beat frequency and perceieved imagery), delivering to the listener, a sample from the 'churn' of trance"
3,The Opposite Effect...,"My mom somehow got this book for me when I was a teenager, because she was apparently concerned about my ongoing and blossoming interest in the ""supernatural"". This was her attempt, as an evangelical Christian, to dissuade me from my interests. Unfortunately for her, (and, like so many books of it's time, for me), it had the completely opposite effect. For a long time, I learned more about witchcraft and the occult by reading ""Christian"" literature than anything else in the marketplace at that time (Thank you, Jack T. Chick!). These folks are like screamers who say, ""Don't go near the fire!"" All they do is fan the flames of interest. Get a clue, folks."
1,If I could give this book 0 stars I would!!!,"I knew it would be bad from the moment I saw it because, WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT TO ESAPE FROM WITCHCRAFT? ... Wicca is a great religon and It is not about worshiping the devil. Witches worship God. ... ... Dont waste your money. ..."
5,Well made - Versatile Ski Bag,"The High Sierra is a well designed and well constructed wheeled double ski bag. It fits my 2 shaped skis easily. I am a big fan of the external retention straps because it keeps the bag compact and the skis snug such that they will not shift during travel. I first looked at the larger Dakine Double Concourse bag which would also allow you to pack your ski boots, but after adding up the weight of the bag and two skis, I would end up going over the 50 lbs airline limit. The High Sierra is more compact and appropriate in size. The adjustable length will make it possible to fit in the back of vehicles that a larger bag could not. I haven't traveled with it to comment on durability, but so far I am very happy with this purchase."
5,How can a weather nerd not love this book?!?!,"This has to be one of the best desk references out there for any forecaster or weather hobbyist. Tim lays out what each chart, model prog, diagram, satellite image, and radar product is used for... and then gives you multiple internet links for you to use to find real-time data for yourself. This is an excellent companion to the Weather Forecasting Handbook (the purple book), and any excellent desk reference for any forecaster!"
2,Weather Map Handbook,"I am not very happy about this handbook. I thought it was more specific, more detailed about maps, with more examples and connections between different maps. The part of numerical weather prediction should have been excluded, in my opinion, from interpretation of maps."
3,Okay little dollhouse....,"We got this for Christmas this year. It has been a little disappointing. First, the little girls arm fell off, on Dec 26th! (I called FP and they sent out a new one quickly). The biggest disappointment is how the people won't sit in the chairs, esp the kitchen chairs. This really frustrates my daughter, 3 1/2, who doesn't play with this house much at all."
4,great for its age group!!,"my 10 yr old sister got this for a christmas gift. i was very nervous about her getting it because she is not a very patient person. amazingly, she completed the entire set herself. i tihnk its a great toy for the 6-10 age group. its a little bit young for me (13) but its a really great toy for older elementary students!!"
4,Secure the Dam,My grandson loves these Command Ops sets. I'm not sure who puts the age labels on them. I'm 60 and it took me 4 hours to assemble the set. Once assembled he had a great time playing with it.These sets are almost impossible to find. I'm wondering if they have been discontinued.
4,My Son's Mega Bloks,My son wanted this set and loves it. We had to put it together for him as he has trouble with this sort of thing. He does love playing with it. It was shipped quickly and the directions were easy.
5,Fun,This is a real fun set. Tons of pieces and so much to do. you can get the other playsets to add on as well. Lots of imagination fun as well. Overall great set for boys or girls.
4,good filter,"does the job at a very reasonable price...i recommended...bought it for my 2006 Lexus GS300, it fir right and performs well..."
5,Not as confused...,"This book is very helpful to statistics students, especially beginners! The writing is very to the point. The quick tips are great and all tables, charts, formulas, etc. are easy to read. The problems and answers at the end of every chapter are great for review before a test!"
4,"Good, but left me wanting a little more..","This book was of great help to me in my college level statistics course. I've bought a number of statistics books and this one was by far the most readable, clear and concise. My one disappointment was that the book did not cover regression, the F distribution and ANOVA which were part of my course.Lloyd if you are reading this, perhaps you could include it in your next edition? This minor grumble apart, I would highly recommend this as a suppliment to your statistics course notes especially if you need a fast track book with plenty of good examples."
2,Not a book for a beginner.,"It is an ""ok"" book. I bought it thinking i would use some examples/problems in the statistics class I was/still am teaching.I never used it.""Statistics for the Utterly Confused"" has several major flaws for a book that is suppose to be accessible introduction to statistics.Language is too ""complicated"". There is nothing down-to-earth about this book. Indeed, it looks like and reads like a wallstreet journal (newspaper).It covers topics well and it does not spend too much time on things you dont' need, but it is boring to read, not enough examples, and too many redundant questions. (same question first stated as multiple choice, then as short answer, etc... )chapters are NOT in the order that i would have prefered, or the order that most statistics books use.and the Title: as everyone says, it is misleading and just plain wrong for the book."
3,What is the use of statistics.,"In short, this book does an excellent job at showing you how to perform statistical operations. However, it needs much improvement in explaining what the statistical operations are used for, and what their results tell a reader."
2,If you are looking for practical instruction skip this book,"If you are studying for the GMAT or a similar test, this book might be helpful. However, if you are struggling with a problem and need practical advice on what test to use and how to perform it, pass this book by. I bought this book in part because it said on the cover that it would tell you how to use Excel for statistic. Forget that unless you think being told ""this can be done on Excel"" is how-to instructions."
1,This book will utterly confuse you,"Do yourself a favor and avoid this book. The book does not explain, it only documents, with heavy and unnecessary use of terminology. If you want to learn and understand, get Bartz's ""Basic Statistical Concepts,"" an excellent book in it's 4th edition."
3,Okay reference. Too many errors.,"This book is structured more like a reference than a text. As such, it will be helpful as a second reference source to an actual text book to help clarify concepts. There are many better books out there for instruction.My biggest problem with this book is the number of errors in the examples. It seems like you can't go 10 pages without running into an error that make you go, ""wait a minute... didn't he just say... but now he's saying...???""A very good example of such an error is on page 239, example 12-1, where the author states a problem that involves a proportion at 60%, then shows the math at 65%. This book is full of these kinds of issues and will, at times, completely throw you off track."
4,"A ""Must Have"" for any student taking a statistics course.",This is an excellent aid for any statistics student. The chapters are written so that even a grade school student could understand the concepts. Important items are noted and formulas pointed out. I think that this book should be used a replacement for class text books. It is that helpful and easy to understand. I'm not very mathematically inclined and it is helping me pass the class.
2,"So-so book, terrible title",This book is a decent reference for statistics that don't involve calculus. But there's nothing special about that -- there are plenty of others like it out there. The title creates the impression that it's especially accessible or uses some special technique to de-mystify the subject. There is NONE of that sort of sexiness inside the two covers. Just a lot of dry statistics. I suspect that someone at the publisher tried to jazz up an otherwise boring textbook by writing some breathless back-cover copy and putting cute logos on the section headings inside.
5,Beating the statistics phobia?!,"While I doubt I will ever get over my statistics phobia, and I am not sure it is truly possible to use statistics painlessly, I am willing to concede that ""Statistics for the Utterly Confused"" has helped me more than any of the other references I purchased. The material is laid out clearly and concisely. Oftentimes the Quick Tips have given me the information I was looking for without having to read through pages and pages of explanation I already have or do not need in the first place.This book is not intended for those who aspire to be staticians. But for an MBA student such as myself, it is a great supplement to text and classroom work."
2,It wasn't what I thought it would be,"I bought this book because I was having trouble understanding my college textbook. I don't see any difference between the two. If you are looking for a book with ""human"" language that will break down concepts for you, this is not it."
4,Recommended,"For me, more revelant than ""Stats for Dummies"", the Utterly Confused stats book is more focused toward business stats. I found the Cliffs book a bit stiff, Dummies too loose and Utterly confused just about right. At least it helped decipher the Business Stats text book I was trying to wrap my arms around.There's no substitute for a Stats course, and the utterly confused stats book should help ease one into the lingo and nomenclature rather than suffer a head-on crash with syllabus and curriculum."
5,Great Help,I really liked how this book was written. It made it easy to understand what it was explaining. It had many different examples of the many formulas so that I could understand the way to work out the formula. Great book.
1,Missed its target!,A good title right up my ally. So I bought the book. Guess what? It is just another statistics book. Nothing in it geared toward those of us who are utterly confused. I was so disappointed. I really would like to see a book that interpreted statistics. what does all this stuff mean for the guy on the street and how can he use statistics to help him. Haven't found a book yet. I'll accept any recomendations.Jimmy
4,Dark side of the screen,Required reading for any student of noir. Good overview of the classics and good list of second tier noir movies.
4,You'll love Rathe and Grace,"Violet Fire gets better every time I read it. Grace and Rathe are two of my favorite characters of all time. Their story is very sweet, often laugh out loud funny, occasionally sad, and is one of the best romances out there."
2,I didn't love it.,"This story of Grace O'Rourke and Rathe Bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented Brenda Joyce. The absolute worst was Runaway Bride, which I didn't bother to finish after just a few chapters.This book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable. While Rathe was somewhat interesting, Grace was very stereotypical and cliche, in my opinion. Most of Joyce's fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat, and sadly, this book fell short and it fell HARD. None of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile. Is this the same author that wrote The Fires of Paradise?On a more positive note, Joyce's use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story. The plot did not stand up to the setting, and the ""romance"" between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader. If you love stories set in the deep south, you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it."
4,well made little magnifying lamp,"I got this to replace a magnifying light I previous had which died. It had a long articulated arm and took up a lot of space; the goose neck mechanism works quite well and does not waste space. While the magnifying lens of this lamp is slightly smaller, it is clear and not distorted and it is glass. Mine gets a lot of rocks dust which would quickly ruin plastic. It is easy to use, gives good light, and takes up less counter space."
4,Good value,Practical with simple lines and not too industrial looking for those who want a high quality magnifier that is also attractive on the desk. Nice bright light and clear magnifying area.
5,A must-read for Georgia Tech football fans.,"The Bobby Ross years of Georgia Tech football were some of the most frustrating and enjoybale years in Georgia Tech's storied football history. The author gives an extremely accurate account of the heartaches, humiliation, and triumphs of the Georgia Tech football program from 1987 through 1991. I was there, attended most of the games described herein, and am fascinated by the author's accurate account of this period. If you are a Georgia Tech football fan, you MUST own this book. It is a testimony to eveything from ""the thrill of vitrory"" to ""the agony of defeat"". I highly recomment this book!"
1,Flagboy Uber Alles,Tech's amazing journey to the bogus split-championship with Colorado set the stage for the Bill Lewis Era.
4,Very useful,"Ok, this book is very useful for studying japanese grammar and for quick reference. It's a very good idea though to have some basic knowledge about the language and have a, if not decent, then small vocabulary.Also being 'in' to grammar in general will help you a lot. But great book if you want to look at the very technical side of the language."
5,Must Have,"I bought the first edition of this book a long time ago, and it's become completely ragged through use. I rely on it so much for basic grammar reference. While the first edition had an index that was mostly useless, from what I've seen of the second edition, the index (among other things) has been improved greatly. This alone makes me say that this book is a must have. It does help to have background knowledge of Japanese, because if you don't then you'll spend three weeks trying to figure out what the hell stem and base mean, and how to tell what part ofthe verb is which, but if you already know the basics, then this book opens up a wealth of options when it comes to your grammatical abilities. Highly recommended."
3,The manual looks old and it looks like it's faded out from the sun.,"I brought the manual as used because I wanted to look up the specifications when I replaced a new water pump, timing belt, oil cover gaskets, firing order, pan gasket and valve cover gaskets. It does helps me a lot to prevent crack the metal covering on the engine block. Thank you!"
1,This product sucks,"If I could enter a 0 for this product I would. The back of the matress pad is slippery and moves when you turn in bed. Also the binding around the sides is non-existed. This is by all means the worse product that I have purchased at Amazon,com"
2,"Great quality, but locks too stiff for small hands.","I bought the Buck 55 as a first knife for my son. It's the perfect size for his hand, and has excellent weight and rigidity.Problem is, the locking mechanism spring is so stiff, he can't push the lever to close it. Even if his fingers were a bit stronger, it's very unsafe to be using so much force to release the blade. Nice small knife for an adult, but not for a boy."
2,Buck 55 folding knife,two major problems1} knife does not lock when blade is opened2} rivets in handle are not flush with handleI think these knifes are seconds very unusual for Buck to let a knife like this to pass their quality standards
1,Poor. I Returned It,One of the rivets was sticking up so high that it scraped the pad of my fingers when I first picked up the knife. Poor quality control. This knife should never have left the factory. My last Buck knife.Maybe they should pay more attention to QC and spend less time proselytizing about their Senior Partner.
4,Showmanship helps,"A buck knife will last years & is a good investment when it comes to a pocket knife. You'll probably lose it before it wears out & if it does wear out it's guarenteed for life. I got this particular knife for my dad for his b-day, & everything is good w/ the actual knife, but the packaging it came in was very lackluster. I mean I paid $35(or sumthing like that) for this knife & all that it had for a box was slightly larger than the knife(kinda hard to wrap), barely identifying what's inside. A little more showmanship would've been nice for the money on this 1 here."
4,Great first knife or for an extra pocket knife,"I have several Buck knives and have been collecting them for a long time. This is a great little knife. A little pricey for a pocket knife, but for a kid's first Buck knife (or a handy little blade) it is very nice.Pros-Very nice, sleek looking pocket knife-Very sharp-Very tight - no blade play-Made in USACons-A little pricey for some-It's so pretty I'm reluctant to use it.I bought a couple for Christmas gifts. Shipped very quickly and arrived in great shape. I liked so much, I got one for myself."
5,Great knife,"Like the first reviewer said this is a great little knife. I carry it with me every day and never notice it's there until I need it, but at the same time it's big enough to get the job done for every day stuff."
5,Great Pocket Knife,"A little smaller than the double blade pocket knife I was trying to replace, I've found that the Buck 55 is nevertheless a better and a beautiful knife. The quality of the materials and workmanship is superb and the closed knife fits completly and comfortably in the palm of my hand. As a quality and ""proud to own"" light duty pocket knife, you would be hard pressed to find better."
5,"AN INCREDIBLE VERSION OF ""WHAT KIND OF FOOL AM I""","The following tracks on this album are outstanding: What Kind of Fool Am I, If I Ruled the World (a real show stopper), This Nearly Was Mine, The Sweetest Sounds, Whispering, Love Letters, Just Bummin' Around, and Red Roses For A Blue Lady (swinging as only Bobby could do it). These alone make the purchase of this CD a MUST for a real Bobby Darin Fan. When I listen to WHAT KIND OF FOOL AM I, I feel such a sense of loss for the tremendous talent of this man who left us at such a young age. I want more, much more, and I can't have it. The only way the world can have Bobby Darin is through the great recordings that he left us, and these are among his best. This CD is worth having at ANY price."
2,"Should have stayed ""Unreleased""","When you listen to this, you can understand why Capitol didn't release it themselves. Most of the 25 songs are immediately forgetable. At least four songs had been released before (and these are the best). Sound quality is average at best, and most are monaural. If you are a Darin fan (and I am a major one), you can live without this disc. Let's hope that Capitol releases (please, not CCM) the complete live album from the Flamingo that is hinted at in the Rhino set, and the A&E disc."
3,Please Release All,"The powers that be have the right to release whatever they choose, but I am pleased they did eventually release this CD. There are a few of these songs on boxed sets, but I like to make my own choices and am happy to purchase all Bobby's work for my own evaluation. Just don't expect any top 10 hits."
2,"One curiously tepid film is where this ""Truth Lies""","WHERE THE TRUTH LIES seems to have all of the right ingredients for a good film whodunit thriller,like Atom Egoyan,screenwriter of THE SWEET HEREAFTER, actors Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon, and a soundtrack by Michael Danna.These are ingredients for a successful recipe.Sorry! This was simply awful.There was no tension, no suspense and despite Firth and Bacon doing their level best to pull off a ""Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis"" disguised biopic of sorts, actress Alison Lohman, playing reporter Karen O'Connor who takes her clothes off to get to the truth of why the comedy team of Morris and Collins broke up, is quite simply the worst piece of casting and acting I have ever seen.She is dreadful.The film is dreadful.This recipe is a loser.Do not attempt to reheat.The DVD extras are cheap and reveal nothing to aid in understanding why anyone would make this film.It has an extremely cheap look to it.Pass this one."
3,LOOSELY-WRAPPED MURDER MYSTERY,"With a name like Atom, director Atom Egoyan would seem to wish to desperately avoid the pun-making bad film -- a(n atom) bomb. While WHERE THE TRUTH LIES is not exactly a bomb, it is not a source of light or energy either. WTTL is a loosely-wrapped murder mystery which reminds me of those juvenile books, where the teenage girl solves the mystery with a flashlight and some clues. It has that same air of innocence and tameness that doesn't quite jive with the adult panoply of sex, drugs, rock and roll and murder. However, being a fan of Kevin Bacon, I would not write the film off entirely."
1,Colin Firth; What were you thinking???,"What a stinkbomb. Incoherent, incompetent, vulgar, stupid, inept,miscast..this piece of crud has all these qualities and more...Colin Firth what were you thinking when you took this role and what was I thinking when I bought this DVD??"
4,Interesting and amusing,"'Where the truth lies' is a typical drama, its not fiction, its not your regular murder mysteries, just a film that throws light on life. A film that throws light on what goes on behind the curtains, behind the frames, behind every stage, it throws light on the fact that how famous people try to 'keep the show going on!' despite having personal issues. The film is quite unique, if you have the right perspective while watching it. Alison Lohman, Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth have an amazing chemistry with each other. Its a film to watch out for."
2,where the truth lies,did not like the role that colin firth played i prefer him in more lighthappier roles
2,Unconvincing,"Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found ""Truth"" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass."
1,Save your money,"Tepid, predictable, and boring. It's astounding that Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth could be in a movie this bad."
2,Nothing here is convincing or engaging,"I didn't think it was possible to make a movie as bad as this with Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon in major roles. It's really poor. Really. Partly it's the plot -- so much is unbelievable, from Collins' reason for blackmailing O'Connor, to O'Connor's ability to solve the entire mystery after 15 years on the basis of a couple of casual words from Morris. But mostly it's the fact that none of the main characters is remotely convincing or engaging. Lohman is entirely out of her depth, and though Bacon and Firth are competent they're uninspiring. And the pivotal sex scene, which I suppose I shouldn't detail in case I give away the plot, is completely flat. And... well, enough. My advice is, don't bother."
1,Lawrence Barris,"I found this CD to be kind of mechanic, sterile, and lacking in ""soul"". Barris also seems to lack self-confidence and imagination. Kind of a weak, watered down imitation of Klugh. Okay for an amateur, but not professional caliber."
5,Soothing Guitar,"My first introduction to Lawrence Barris came after hearing ""Loveland"" from this cd a few years back. I own both of Lawrence's cds and I think this one is far better than his Love on Me cd. All the songs feature that soft and soothing guitar accented by keyboards and percussion. My favorite is still ""Loveland"", but other good songs include ""Our Midnight Dance"", ""Sometime, Somewhere"" and ""Afternoon Samba"". This cd is definitely worth checking out."
4,great introductory bipolar video,"My older daughter, a social worker, recommended this informative video. It was encouraging for her sister to watch and know that others share her common struggles with adjusting to bipolar disorder. Australian made."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of Veggie Tales and generally love their music, but wasn't as impressed with this CD. We have the ""Veggie Tales: On the Road with Bob & Larry"" CD and love it. Unfortunately it wasn't the same for this Christmas Album."
2,The material is dated,The material is dated. I got about 10% of worth from the material. Tom Dorsey's books are better. The original book was written in 1934. Not much has been done to edit the book for today's markets.
5,Great camera,"I've had this camera for over a year now, and still love it. The docking station makes it easy to transfer pictures with the push of a button, and it also works as a battery charger. The camera itself takes great pics in any light setting, as the flash is dependable. To save power, I now turn the LCD screen off, until I'm ready to review the pictures I've just taken.I think where the photos are processed makes a huge difference in photo outcome. I decided to upload three of the same photos to the three leading photo processing companies available on the web: Ofoto, Snapfish, and Walmart. Ofoto won, hands down, but I recommend you try it for yourself. The difference is amazing, and you can't tell if it was originally a 35mm or digital print."
3,Complete Package,This order said that it would come with a memory card. It didn't and I am still trying to figure out how to contact you about it.
4,A great collection of songs from a great artist!,"Being a Gerry Rafferty fan, this is a great collection of songs from a great artist. However, I wished there would have been more songs from his ""North and South"" and ""Snakes and Ladders"" albums. Better yet, I wished they could be rerealsed to Cd. Thanks for the great music, Gerry!"
4,Great Book,This book is filled to the top with great quality pictures. Wonderful inspiration for me and our new home which we are doing a Tuscan Theme. Will make a good coffee table book as well :)
3,Flavor of Tuscany not a Decorating book,"This is a great book to give the reader a ""flavor of Tuscany"" but I wouldn't recommend it as a general decorating book. It has some absolutely beautiful pictures of the region that can be used to get some ideas about what authentic Tuscan looks like. It will be a bit of a leap from this book to purchasing Tuscan decorating items in the retail market in the U.S."
2,Too Primitive!,The disigns elements were too rustic for my taste. I was looking for more of a casual elegence.
3,It's a good read,"This is another one of those stories with a great idea and excellant artwork to back it up. The only fault I would have with it is that the ideological motivations for the characters' actions are never developed to a point where they were meaningful to me. I'm used to Gaimen, Ennis, Ellis and Carey and, when you're talking about ""world in crisis"" stories, I expect some meaningful insights into a character's emotional development. That wasn't the case here. Mostly, I think, because of the brevity of the book. That said, however, this was a good read."
1,Not as pictured!,"Based on the picture, I was expected a set of three square glass dishes with lids. Imagine my dismay when the order arrived and I found three rectangular dishes without lids. Someone needs to update this photo so customers will actually know what they're getting."
1,You need training or just be honest.,"I ordered this item and received 3 different sizes of baking dishes instead of this one. I returned them with an explaination, in the box, and again received the same 3 baking dishes. I Talked with the Amazon people, and they said that it was a miss write on the description, and that they were fixing it as we were talking. They credited my account. A week later I checked for the Item I wanted and there it was, no different than when I first ordered it. I really wanted this item and it seems that they can't deliver. I will order it from Lehman's catalog. This item is cheaper through them anyway. I will reconsider purchasing any items that go through Target. They also indicated that they would send me a free gift for the inconvenience. Never got it.Anchor Hocking Oven Basics Glass Baking Dish Trio"
2,Excellent backup from Vendor,I bought this item from the Homedale Discount Store and they provided excellent backup and stood behind the product that they shipped me. I would purchase from them through Amazon again.
2,Cheap,"All plastic.You cannot angle the head.We were not happy with this, overall.By replacing the low flow washer with a standard, the pressure was good. This shower head's main downfall was the fact is is plastic and you can't angle the head in any direction other than on plane with the pipe."
1,Cheap plastic,"Nice flow from the shower head, but the entire assembly is made with plastic and very fragile. It broke within a few months of purchase and is not repairable. Buyer beware, spend some more bucks for one made of metal."
4,Nice Flow,"I bought three! My first impression after opening the first Waterpik JP-140 was disappointment because of its plastic construction. Installation was a snap. Everything is included. I liked the way the head easily adjusts to accommodate taller persons. The flow produced by the JP-140 is exactly what I was seeking. This type of shower head provides plenty of water but doesn't wet the walls of the entire shower. Overall, for the price, this is a great shower head."
2,Worthless plastic.,"I usually don't have a problem with Waterpik products, but this one really stinks. There is absolutely no water pressure from this head and when you remove the ""water saving"" washer, it just leaks all over. It's made entirely of plastic, and seems kind of flimsy. I'll probably end of buying another one."
2,Simple Pleasure but beware,"We discovered this type of shower head while on vacation. We needed something adjustable for the TALL people in our house. This one does the same thing as much higher priced models and we are VERY pleased. A real simple pleasure. March 2010 Amended review:we found that if you are too rough with it it will break as the ""chrome"" only describes the color. It was made of plastic."
4,Good for the money,"Just what the doctor ordered. Decent construction, good flow of water, and nice spray pattern.Can't argue with the price either!"
4,great gift,"i love this shower head, dont worry about loosing pressure,you wont...its soo much easyier to take a nice shower with out having to leann back and get under the shower head, thats when a lot of accidents happen like slip and fall or nausia...it makes it a lot easyier to clean the shower because it has a lot more movement then other shower heads.its also better if you like to shower together not so much walking around eachother and for a bath it makes it kinda like a rainforest....for sure two thumbs way up..."
5,"Great value, and at the right price","I needed a new shower head and I wanted something with some adjustment to it, especially for height. This is it. The price is right and the product installs easily and comes in minimal packaging. The shower head is about 4 inches in diameter give or take. It has flow control and an additional washer that makes the water pressure better. I use both, and have to say I am very pleased with the product. This gets 5 stars based on value and what the product does. I know there are nicer shower heads out there but this one can't be beat for the price.I am pleased with the showerhead and recommend it to anyone considering an item in this price range."
5,Hey! It's a downpour!,Yep - this showerhead is great - lot's of jets and feels like more water pressure for you folks who don;t really have great water pressure in your bathrooms.I reccommend it highly.
1,WARNING,"When the product arrived, it functioned well. Water penetrated all of the roughly 30 holes of the shower head. A few months later, water only penetrates seven of the holes (perhaps because hot water melted the plastic?) This is a terrible product, don't waste your money!"
1,you get what you pay for (not much),"Based on the general design, this should have worked; we're trying to get a head with more control of spray orientation for a ""closet"" shower. This would work IF it wasn't so poorly constructed. Cheap plastic...leaks out of every joint. I suggest you keep looking."
1,Leaks,"Great shower head, while it lasts. The arm is made of plastic and begins to crack after a few months of use, causing water to spray everywhere. Waterpik sent a replacement unit, but this one also had the same issue after a few months of use."
4,Not very well built,"I bought this showerhead 2 months ago and when I installed it I threw away the warranty information as I didn't consider it necessary. How often do plumbing type parts fail? Not often or at all based on my past experience. Well, much to my shock this showerhead has in less than 2 months time developed a crack in it. Now I have to go through the trouble of finding the warranty information on it. Not a well built product to develop a crack so soon.Found my warranty information, called them and they sent a replacement piece. It has held up so far, so I'm raising the rating on this product from a 1 to a 4 as the manufacturer was prompt on the replacement part and it is holding up."
1,cracked after 4 months cheap plastic,"For the price this is fine, but I'm not expecting it to last, it is very cheap plastic and seams like it will break. For now it works as desired, it has sufficient water pressure, and a nice spray. Its adjustability is great for tall guys and gals..UPDATE: After a few month it developed a hairline fracture where it rotates for raising and lowering the height."
3,Description not accurate,"The product description says the shower head is 6 inches wide. I bought this because I have one of this model with the 6 inch shower head which is great, but the JP-140 with arm shower head (which I bought) is NOT the same product as the JP-120 (which is 6 in wide) The JP-140 with arm showerhead is only 3.5 inches wide. As to how it works, I don't know because I was so disappointed at the size that I am returning it."
2,Drenching shower... no.,"WaterPik advertises this as a ""drenching shower"". Nope, not even close. Feels like a regular shower with thin, forced water streams hitting you.All plastic, so one has to be gentle with it."
2,Not as described,The showerhead is actually plastic. Not very sturdy. Lightweight and it doesn't move in any direction but side to side. Does not move up and down. It isn't very adjustable as the description states. Not satisfied with the item.
5,Badass,"I love this knife! I was first given this model of knife 5 years ago and have loved it from day one, but it has since been stolen. I just purchased the blue model and have had it for about a month now. It is super sharp, fits in ""girl-jeans"", but I must say the assisted opening option my favorite feature. I would highly recommend this knife to any chick wanting a little peace of mind. They make bigger sizes which are more suitable for men."
5,Great Umbrella,Great umbrella that works great and is great looking. This umbrella is solid and opens with authority and a great swoosh! Big enough to keep you dry. I love the handle and how the automatic open button is integrated into the handle. Great stuff!
2,Lackluster and Disappointing,"Don't bother with this release. The only Mike Curb Congregation CD you'll ever need is ""Greatest Hits."" That one is really terrific, and the $5.98 price is hard to beat. You will be pleased, so buy it now! (I did not realize that the MCC did the backing vocals on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s wonderful ""Candy Man."")Richard Veit"
3,Relaxing but not upbeat enough,The songs were relaxing and nice to listen to before I went to bed but they are not too fun to listen to when you have a lot of energy. I reccomend listening when you want to relax and sort of forget the world for a while.
2,Wasted Money.,"I am new to the recruiting business and I was hoping this would give me a good knowledge base to start with. Instead I got two short CD's with very little information other than several rambling, unstructured anecdotes. There is an occasional bit of helpful information, but this program is just not worth the money. You'd be better off buying something from one of the many other sales speakers like Brian Tracy or Tom Hopkins etc."
2,Partially useful but fully overpriced!,"This could be condensed down to 20 minutes of useful information and priced more appropriately to that level. I'm a former HR and business executive with 15 years in the profession who started up a recruiting and consulting business 18 months ago. I've been on the other end of the line when recruiters call and the approach to selling described on the CD seems more suited to car sales. Final note, in this age of technology and e-communication quite a bit of the information provided is not at all progressive."
2,Good? Yes. Worth 80 bucks? No.,"The information and advice given is certainly valid and useful. However, I don't feel that it merits the price tag."
2,NOT really as described,For starters the item was described 8 inches. Its not. Its barely 5 inches. its small and fits in the palm of my hand. I expected a small 8 in plush the size of bean bag animal and got half of that. Otherwise good quality. Its soft and my son will love that it can hold on to his favorite stuffed animal.
4,"Fair price, decent text","I am a college professor and use this book in my intro to theatre course. It is inexpensive and the students find it easy to read and enjoyable. Not the best book in the world, but it works great as an introductory text."
3,Stanley fatmax toolbox,"This toolbox seems pretty perfect in every way, but ever since I bought it, I have had a problem with both latches, and finally last week the left one popped right off, figure though as soon as I drill some holes and use some 1/4 20s, it will be better than new, nice tool box, gotta make smoother/better quality latches"
5,The Contemporary Christian: Applying God's Word to Today's World,"The word religion comes from a Latin word, meaning a ""model for regulating life according to the gods."" More correctly, Christianity is a revelation of a ""given"" model, specifically Jesus of Nazerath. Dr. John R. W. Stott, in his book, THE CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN, focus on living out a ""faith, once delivered to the saints,"" in a time frame radically different from Jesus' day, more than 2000 years ago. He does the job with conscious sensitivity to these radical differences better than any writer I know."
3,"Good, but flawed....","Stott gives us a level-headed, comprehensive exposition of what it means to be a present-day Christian, with some chapters that are dedicated to pulpit ministers. It would be difficult to find a book that had less faults, but the faults of this book are pretty big.There's nothing wrong with the doctrine of the book--unless you, like me, have no sympathy for Calvinism (which makes a couple of brief appearances in the form of assertions of human depravity)--it's the writing. While Stott writes with extraordinary clarity, he also is so careful in this book to make his case with calmness and generosity that the finished product is bland. The language he uses is uninspired, uninspiring, and unimaginative.So Stott makes a good case; it's just that the book is uninviting."
4,Under-rated,"This is a workhorse brush whose fine tip stays but which has a lot more belly than its appearance would let you think could happen. It is also forgiving, so that if you do not clean and point it after use, and find it fuzzy, you can wet it down and 'snap' it, and the point will return.I use them a lot to make my watercolours and tile projects both, because when they eventually do wear down, you don't feel awful as you might had you been using a Kolinsky sable!pat chapin[...]"
5,Wonderful Quality,I purchased the bracelet and earrings that go with this wonderful necklace. The necklace is light weight and very delicate looking but great quality it looks wonderful against dark brown or tanned skin types because of its golden glow. It arrived in this extremely beautiful dark blue faux velvet box which actually has straps to hold the necklace and matching bracelet in their positions.The earrings come in their own dark blue velvet box which has a an oval lid. Clearly their designed to last and be worn for special occasions however because this is amber you can wear it during the day and it will not look out of place. I love the fact that the amber has been fashioned to resemble leaves and petals. This is a very feminine piece of jewelry suitable for day and evening wear in my opinion worth the money!
3,Annoying,"We like the Veggie Tales, but most of this CD is really annoying and noisy. The best part is the medley through the end of the album, where they sing some traditional, Christ-centered songs. Otherwise, I think this CD was a waste of money."
5,Super!,"I love this series. From the moment I read it at the library, I was in awe. Definately check it out if you like shoujou romance stories ^_^"
2,there's better things to read...,"I'd never heard of this before I picked it up. The first thing that I really noticed was the artwork - the people in this have the biggest eyes I have ever seen in anything, manga or anime. Even the main ""heart throb"" character has large eyes, framed by eyelashes that would make most girls jealous. I decided to ignore all that and give this a try anyway. I almost didn't finish it, because I couldn't understand what Kira (a shy student who's good at art) could possibly see in Rei (the heart throb I mentioned). Granted, this is the first book in this series that I've read, but it's only book two, so you'd think there'd still be redeeming bits of his character showing through. Instead, he spends much of the book either not caring about anything or beating people up. I might keep up with this series, just because there were hints that Rei was going to change, but so far it doesn't look too promising."
1,Not the edition as pictured,I opened the packaging and it was the 2nd edition of the book and not the 3rd as is pictured. Sort of false advertising... It was not enough money to make me send it back and all the hassle cause i needed a book for my math class and the examples in the book are not numbered the same but with some looking back and forth i can find the same examples as the teacher gave thanks to a class mate letting me take part of it. But for a bigger sized lecture this book had been unusable..
4,Great way to learn about geomorphology,Great way to learn about geomorphology. I call it a teaching moment - teach your children about how rocks are formed and they see the result. Of course you need a rock tumbler but you get the idea :)
5,Just what I was looking for!,This was a gift I purchased for a family member. He loved it and I am glad I found it! Thanks!
1,I give up,"We are besieged by squirrels, and I hate killing animals which only act as nature intended. So I originally bought the smaller trap, which was way too small. I bought this one thinking it was the answer, but I couldn't make heads or tales of the assembly, and the directions only served to confuse me further. After three hours of total frustration I wrapped it up and returned it, a $7.95 shipping charge lesson learned. Maybe I'm mechanically challenged, but now I'm just doing the math, an act nature intended for humans; a bullet only costs 5 cents."
1,Has not held animal that trips release.,"I purchased the Havahart Model #1088 3 to 4 months ago and set it up that day. I baited it with peanut butter for squirrels &/or skunks. Something has tripped the release from 3 to 4 times per week and some how gets out of the trap. I called Havahart and they asked me several questions and I went though all the steps they told me to do as we were on the phone. The next morning the trap was tripped and nothing was in the trap. However, the trap door is always shut and won't open wihtout me resetting it. Any answers for me will be appreciated.John A"
2,Production engineering failure,"This is a good idea brought down by poor production engineering. The release door wouldn't work without modification, and the trigger bar needed to be bent before it took something less than a couple pounds to trip.I would NOT buy it again, even though I need a trap for these critters."
2,Have a heart trap.,"We got this for a squirrel problem we were having and it didn't catch a thing. I don't know if it was because the squirrels were disinterested in the bait after they ate the first round without it springing, or if they just didn't wsant to venture into the trap so I'm giving it 2 stars for the benefit of the doubt but it didn't work for me at all."
5,Works great!,"For the price, the cage works great for catching squirrels. So far, we have caught 11 squirrels and relocated them. After letting the animal out, there is a metal pin you have to re-insert and position a certain way. It takes a little getting used to, but overall the product is good for the price."
4,RABBIT CATCHER,"WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH RABBITS EATING THE TOPS ON MY YOUNG SHRUBS THIS WINTER, WILL BE READY FOR THEM THIS FALL, I'LL BE EATING THEM."
3,So far no Squirrels trapped.,"First, the instructions were not very good. I think they could have done a better job with this. I set the trap twice with the recommended food as peanut butter on bread or cracker.The squirrel came in to get the food ate it and left. Same thing second time. The damm squirrel came back in the trap ate the peanut butter bread and even took a crap in the trap and left. I have set the trap for a third time and know waiting to see if this does the trick.The lever bar doesn't stay engaged properly and seems to slip off. I modified it slightly to be sure it stays secure. I don't think I should have to modify the trap though. It should work properly without modification."
1,making a trap way too complex !?,"What is the matter with you !? You take a simple trap and make a bunch of loose parts, doesn't work. very poor design and build.should be a door that locks and a cage so they cant get out. KISS Keep it simple STUPID."
3,"Interesting with good info, but amateur publishing standards","This book makes for interesting reading regarding the history and maintenance of many camera makes and styles. There is a lack of organization in the presentation. Some illustrations are very amateurish yet sufficient detail is visible. Strangely, the author dives into great detail on rather obscure repair issues yet neglects to discuss some of the most commonly encountered problems. A fun read, but I wouldn't attempt a repair of any magnitude using only this book."
2,Not as helpful as Mr. Romney writes in his own review.,"While somewhat interesting, the book lacks sufficient information for what it costs. One of the biggest drawbacks is that it does not have an adequate Troubleshooting section, which is the first place one would go to determine the direction(s) where one should begin. For example, a stuck shutter in almost any 35mm camera would have common reasons for the stuck shutter. The reader could then try the different fixes given. It simply lacks the more common problems the novice might find. The illustrations are barely adequate and there is a ""cheapness"" to this spiral-bound manual that looks like it was run off a Xerox machine. If you are searching for a top-notch introduction to repairing cameras, well there are none that I have found, but the Thomas Tomosy books are the better place to start."
1,Like watching paint dry!,"This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever watched. It's much like watching paint dry - or watching grass grow. There should have been a disclaimer at the beginning suggesting that the viewer should fast forward at 3x or 4x to come reasonably close to the normal movement of actual humans. People just don't act like this. If someone says, ""let's go,"" you don't stand and stare at the floor for 15 minutes before you move. When someone asks you a question, you don't stare at them for 10 minutes before your lips begin to move. Watching this was a real waste of my time."
1,this is not the hungarian soundtrack,"this dvd with release date 10 january 2012 (Kimstim. region 1) even though it claims otherwise on its box and in the amazon product details - has only one english/french soundtrack - it only has english subtitles when french is spoken - image is out of sync with the soundtrack as well - so this is now another variant in the versions of ""the man from london"" - but not the one i want to see and hear ....... with hungarian soundtrack and english subtitlesi refuse to rate this item ..... however then the review is not published ..... so this rating is for the system of rating itself - minimal ..... one star ...... a disaster star"
5,Maui Jim's,Needed a second pair that easily fit in my laptop bag and wanted different color as well. Perfect width at temple and bridge for those needing wider sunglasses without lenses being too far apart.
3,"review of ""here comes the sun"" book","I was looking forward to this book as I had heard positive things about it.While it certaintly isnt a bad book neither is it definitive.Their appear to be glaring errors on certain dates, a year out in some cases. Also,the main thing that irritated me was that large parts of Georges career seemed to be glossed over, barely mentioned or totally ignored. I know this book concentrates on his spiritual journey but it also has the word musical in the title as well. On that basis, I was expecting a lot more in depth coverage of Georges musical contributions to ""that band"". Major albums like revolver, pepper and the white album that saw George developing into a great songwriter barely get a passing nod.The authors admiration for his subject is obvious and I dont want to sound harsh, but in my opinion there was too much emphasise on the spiritual and not enough on the musical. HARE KRSNA !!"
2,Poorly Written Book About A Wonderful Guy,"This book introduced me to George the human being. I don't regret having read it. But imagine that there's a really great book about George out there, which a 10th grader reads and then writes a report about. This book is like that report. A slightly sophomoric retelling of a great story.The author just doesn't braid together a well-told biography.Still worth reading, don't pay full price."
2,Full of Errors,"I found this book very superficial for the most part. An exploration of George's spirituality is an interesting subject, but there were so many errors in this book that I began to question what was fact or or fiction in discussions of George's spiritual life."
2,A let down,"The raving reviews tricked me into buying this cd. I did like the early work of the Searchers, but this album is simply muddy and repetitive. I've listened several times wondering if a track would grow on me, but only Switchboard Susan comes close. The vulgar use of ""extension"" in that song, however, strikes it from my playlist."
5,Shawn's Review,"This book is like you are being told what will happen at gladiator school. That is what makes it funny. Even though it is funny, you learn things. For instance, did you know that you would have to eat barley grains and roasted beans for dinner and ash for dessert? Another reason I like this book is the illustrations. The illustrations also make the book funny because they make the people look weird. You may have read another books in the ""You wouldn't want to"" series. As you know they are really good books.By Shawn"
5,"Deep, Dark, and Dangerous: Adventures and Reflections on the Andrea Doria",It was a gift to my son in law and he said it was great.
2,Sequel not as good as the original,"Gary Gentile's original book, ""Andrea Doria: dive to an era"" was an excellent recollection of the original wrecking of the vessel, and early attempts to dive it.Unfortunately, the follow up, ""Deep, Dark and Dangerous"" is not quite so good. Although it still has some engaging tales to tell, the narrator gets side tracked into too much grinding detail. In particular, his attempts to describe how to reach parts of the wreck swimming in a three dimensional environment render the narrative tortuous from time to time.There are some fascinating parts of the book that follow on from and amplify earlier stories presented in the first book, but it would have been better to re-release an updated version of the first book rather than try to ambitiously spin a second book out of limited material."
4,"Try, try, try again","As an avid never smoked non-smoker, my eyes were opened to the complexities of trying to break this one little habit. I have much more respect for my friends and family members that have accomplished this feat through the years. Hats off to Julia for not letting past defeats lessen her determination. This book is a thumbnail view into the highs and lows of her very interesting life. It is a great read for anyone interested in how other people handle everyday life."
3,"wow, its --- ok","Four days ago, I had a motorola razr, and it was time for me to get a new phone. Well, my razr was terrible, so I doubted rizr a little, but since the design was hot (and it was 2 MP camera!), I got it. Well, heres the pros and cons:Pros:1.Nice design with skin that gives you firm grip2.Has 2MP camera and memory card slot to let you take more pics3.Springy slide so you dont need much forceCons:1.The camera doesn't seem like 2MP and feels same as the average 1.32.MP3 sounds like radio and some music cannot be played even though it can be played in other phones or MP3s3. Theres no change from the razr to the rizr; just slide and MP3.It's just an average phone; just overrated by many critics and overpriced too. You'll probably find a better phone than this one."
5,"Heart, healing and humor in a practical resource","Clinicians and their patients will benefit equally from reading and USING Dr. Monti's insightful, well organized, and clearly written discussion of the defenses we use to protect ourselves. After describing the mechanisms by which we choose defenses that fit our innate personality types and respond to childhood traumas, whether grave or seemingly insignificant, Dr. Monti helps the reader to learn more about why their defensive behavior no longer serves them. Honest self-appraisal, based on compassion for the child that developed these defenses in order to survive, can be done in a logical and safe context using this book and its accompanying workbook. The result is a heightened level of awareness that leads to change.I have recommended this book to dozens of patients, and use it in group and individual therapy as a framework for psychological healing in a practical, yet profound, process."
4,Good guide for kids and teenager!,My son love it and enjoy it. It is a good start for kids how show a interest in biology
4,Another entry for the same CD,"See my review under the disc's other entry, where you might find it cheaper as well:John Foulds: Seven Essays in the Modes, etc."
5,"An intricate mapping and documentary study of Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam","A project of the Oracle Institute (A charity designated to revealing Truths from the past, present, and future), The Truth: About The Five Primary Religions And The Seven Rules Of Any Good Religion is an intricate mapping and documentary study of Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Identifying the similarities among each of these otherwise diverse religious movements, The Truth concisely describes the evolution of religion and theology through the past twenty-thousand years, the fracturing of the New Age movement, and the nearing of the fourth coming Spiritual Paradigm and revolution of societal perspectives. The Truth is to be given high praise and is very strongly recommended reading for dedicated students of interfaith religious studies."
5,"Sunny CA, just picture it.","As the short introduction says `Rarely has one geographic region been the focus of such intense visual interest as the state of California' This well produced (and inexpensive) paperback manages to capture the feel of the new Eden. The pictorial material is mainly from the 1930s to 1950s and includes a wide range of printed ephemera (a Sunkist orange wrapper to NBC Radio City, Hollywood, Studio Tour brochure for example) and I liked the nine examples of three-dimensional maps, unfortunately shown too small to really appreciate the detail. All the favorites of the State have a showing, the Giant Redwoods, Death Valley, Hollywood, Dude Ranches, San Francisco etc. The images are illustrative rather than photographic and this is why I think the book works so well, you can see how commercial artists have been allowed portray California as big, bold and bright."
1,Not my kind of book,"This may possibly be a good book - I found it so boring I gave up after reading only a third of it. Maybe I missed the good part. Although I am a compulsive reader (who ELSE reads the side of cereal boxes?), I couldn't force myself to finish it."
4,Very Enjoyable,All Sandy Denny is good.The Trevor Lucas tracks stand on their own also.Wish I could find treasure like this in my attic.
2,Sandy Shines Over the Other Material,"""Moments"" a track on the cd, is said to be Sandy's last recording. It is exquisite and worth the cost of the cd, which otherwise is not memorable and at times bothersome as Trevor Lucas' voice is very pedestrian compared with Sandy's."
4,Excellent product,Reconditioned but looks new to me. It's a little bit noisy but maybe they all are. Have not tested the nail gun yet but so far so good.
5,"Great value, looks new to me!","The compressor and tools look completely new, there is no indication anywhere that they are not. Everything worked flawlessly out of the box. The compressor is very lightweight, so you can carry it to the point of use instead of running a hundred feet of hose. And it comes with just the right length of hose and quick-connects. It's a typically noisy pancake compressor, and I don't see it as a heavy-use unit (like for running framing guns), particularly since it is oiless. But for finish work, it's really perfect. A pair of earplugs might help keep you sane, though."
1,Quality control issue,"I just received a reconditioned Porter Cable combo and was very disappointed. The regulator was clearly defective it blew air through the housing. I tried tightening connections and it would hold no compression. The unit was reconditioned in Mexico and I have read that there are real quality control issues in their factories. If you make this purchase and are dissapointed, as I was, call customer service they can at least expedite the shipping of a new unit because they can't do a replacement upgrade- Amazon will make it right. As far as I am concerned I won't touch another reconditioned tool that is reconditioned in Mexico, until I hear that they are bringing their quality standards up. I have read extensively about Maytag quality issues since they moved their factory from Iowa to Mexico!! The articles I read spoke of the fact that the factories in Mexico rely on day labor for sometimes critical manufacturing roles and turnover is way over 100%."
2,Lot's of pretty pictures. Short on recipes.,"If you want some excellent photography of several great homes in the South, you will enjoy this book. It will make an attractive addition to anyone's coffee table. If you want a good collection of recipes from the south, then look elsewhere. The quantity of recipes is limited; and the ones that are there are found, for the most part, in dozens of other cookbooks. Save your money."
5,A Must for Collie Owners,"The book is thoroughly enjoyable from any collie owner's point of view, as it depicts a collie in the land of its ancestry doing its original work in modern times. Collies are a heritage breed with a proud working background that we should not forget.Be prepared because Gael is a small English working type of collie, not a show collie to which we are accustomed in North America. At first glance I thought she was a sheltie, but in the introduction of the book Halsell refers to what he considers the fine points of a collie (p.11). You would think he means border collie from the written word, but Gael is a sweet looking, little sable and white collie, with great adventures!I loved learning about the nature of the British countryside, with the illustrations and photos complementing the stories about Gael. As a sheep farmer, I appreciated Halsell's knowledge on this topic as well."
5,Great Shetland collie dog,"Having read the previous review I have to tell readers that the dog is in fact a Shetland. Eric Halsall wrote in the forward of the book that Gael is of Shetland descent with the inbred wisdom and sheep sense of the little collies of the Islands. Whatever kind of sheepdog she is, Gael is a fine animal. It is as much about the animals she encounters and lives with as about her. Her kind nature and intelligence made her a great working dog and companion."
1,bad,these mats are poorly designed/made because the plastic is warped and there is no way to securely attach them to concrete (even with stickies).
3,"simple to use, but with one flaw","The park smart parking mat worked as advertised, in that you can feel the front tire settle into the groove. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and outlined the location of the mat with a permanant marker. This is a must on concrete because it moves all the time. Perhaps a different material on the bottom of the mat would keep it in one spot. Isn't that kind of the point of buying this product in the first place?"
1,Not so smart parking mat,The mats move as the tire rolls over the first bump. This makes them useless as garage parking markers.
3,Tire Stop Map,Pretty good product for what you pay. The only issue is that the tape doesn't stick to the garage floor that well.
4,Tire Stop Parking Mat,"Nice product, very yellow (I thought I was ordering black) but they work well and do the job"
4,Tire STop,"Just as ordered and in reasonalble delivery time. Worked as describe,instructions clear and easy to followed. Good product, good service.Would order product again and from dealer."
5,Hard to fine flip on sun glassses,I searched all over Tucson for these glasses for my Dad. He uses them because of his macular degeneration. As usual was able to fine on Amazon and they are perfect for his needs. They arrived early and are exactly as purported on the website. Great experience again.
5,Just what I needed,I priced shooting glasses and other clip-ons in yellow on several internet sites after being unable to find them in retail stores. Did find one that would special order them for more than $100. This is exactly what I wanted as a clip-on for night driving. They take off the glare and enhance the area I can see at the periphery of the headlight penetration. I would recommend these for anyone.
5,Polycarbonate Clip on night driving glasses,"If you have a problem with the bright lights at night, this could really help. The times I have used them for night driving the bright lights have not been a problem like they usually are. I would recommend them a good driving aid to anyone who has a problem with bright lights at night."
4,report on customer satisfaction,"they fit my requirements, no further comment necessary cannot comment further ,it was a rather small item so difficult to say more"
3,Flimsy.,"These are true canary yellow. They work well enough, but have a serious downside.The lenses themselves are nothing more than rimless, thin, pieces of plastic. They are extremely flimsy, and easy to scratch.I would pass on these."
5,PERFECT,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR CLIP-ON SHOOTING GLASSES. THEY WORK AS PROMISSED AND FIT MY GLASSES PERFECTLY. AND THE PRICE IS GREAT.
3,Computer Glasses,"These are great if you have a glasses case to keep them in, however they got scratched up very easily and very quickly. They make it much easier to stare at computer screens for long periods of time while either doing work, facebook, or computer games. Your eyes adjust quickly so that things look normally colored, but when you take them off things look a bit blue for about a minute. They work over any 4-eye specs to make 6-eyed folk, and I must say I loved them until they got too scratched to use."
3,A little concerned,I purchased this watch for my husband last month and there is a problem with the clasp. It will not stay closed and continually falls open. For the price of this watch I honestly expected better quality.
4,A Fun Musical,The recording of Sweet Charity is terrific. The recoding is clear and understandable. It is bette if you see the show first and then listen to the ecording.
5,Great book!,"Joy Adamson was an amazing woman. After she and her husband George reintroduced Elsa the lioness back into the wild she took on the challenge of a cheetah.Pippa the cheetah's story began in The Spotted Sphinx and is continued in Pippa's Challenge. You'll cheer at Pippa's accomplishments, cringe at her challenges and in this book root for her and her family.Most books i read then pass on to another person. Not this one. Or others by Adamson. They're keepers. You'll want to go back to them again and again.She also wrote Queen of Shaba about the leopard Penny. I recommend that one as well."
5,"A Real ""Head Turner""","I'm very big on watches.... Especially the larger diameter ones. This watch is absolutely HUGE. That in itself draws attention. But, combine it's size with the skeletal movement, and you've got a real ""head turner"" of a timepiece. Whenever I wear this piece, I get nothing but compliments about it. I would suggest, however, on changing the band - unless you are really planning on wearing it in the water. I put a black leather band with a stainless butterfly clasp on it instead.It keeps excellent time, despite the relatively modest price tag. Not being an automatic movement, you will need to keep it wound. It doesn't bother me having to wind it every other day. It's really easy to tell when it needs to be wound seeing as the mainspring is as plain as day in the 5 o'clock position on the face.All in all, a really great buy. A swiss watch that's begs to be stared at. Excellent accuracy. And, lest we forget, it looks a lot more pricey than it really is.Highly recommended."
5,The series keeps going strong,"Well, if you read ""New Beginnings"" than you're already going to get this, and if you haven't then you really should read that first. In any case, this was a spectacular volume with enthralling plots, that don't switch between humor and drama, but maintain both at the same time."
4,"Counterfeiters Doth never prosper, unless you're 'The ""Fed"" '...","Picture on cover is a recovering Byron Dale,a libertarian South Dakota farmer who madehis own money, redeemable in nothing, likethe military script we carry around in ourpockets every day, issued by the criminalenterprise know as the 'Ferderal Reserve',which is NOT Federal (any more than FredSmith's Federal Express!) and has NO reserves!Agents of the 'Fed' went to call on Dale @his farm and bashed him over the head witha 32 oz. Hunts ketchup bottle! Dale neverdid get his lawsuit processed but then, atleast he didn't end up like Gordan Kahl &his family either. Recommended reading ofUS government tyranny, when they are boredand mad..."
3,Quite nice,"i really like the drawn vision of Matthew with big motorcycle, grey eyes that seem to shine through. And i like about the revelation. But the storyline isn't really extraordinary, people would've guessed who's the killer, well at least i did. What i like about this book is how Emily has to hold her feelings for him. It's nice!"
5,DANGEROUS TO LOVE SERIES BOOK DESCRIPTION,"WELCOME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF PARADISE...When Emily planned on hyping her new B & B by republicizing a fifteen-year-old unsolved murder, she never dreamed the townspeople would react so bitterly. Or that attempts on her life would be part of the deal... Her life in Paradise quickly became a living hell.But then Matthew Steele blew into town... and everything changed. As Emily sized up the mysterious stranger astride his motorcycle, she found herself lost in his arresting gray eyes. Was it a mere coincidence that he resembled the alleged killer from all those years ago, or could he possibly be her knight in shining black leather?"
2,Poorly made and hard to use...,"My daughter loves the Bratz dolls and make-up, so I figured this was the perfect combo. She does enjoy playing with this, but it is hard to keep together and hard for her to get into the make-up. The hardest thing to keep together is the legs on the vanity itself. They aren't sturdy at all and keep falling off. Many of the make-up items are hard for me to get into! I think she would play with this more if it were easier to use. Right now it is in a baggie under the Christmas tree not being played with..."
1,beware it may contain very small amounts of citrinin or heavy metals,"I was able to read ""the fine print"" on the label when the product was delivered. I learned that this product contains small amounts of citrinin and heavy metals, which can cause health problems. I phoned Solaray who verified this. I threw the bottle away.Then I reseached several other brands of Red Yeast Rice and purchased a different brand that is grown in the US (not China where there are less restrictive health and safety regulations) specifically to be free of citrinin and heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, lead, mercury) and has extensive laboratory testing to ensure the product's high quality and safety."
2,No results so far,I went off Lipitor with my doctor's approval. I have very high good cholesterol but my total is always over 200. So far this hasn't helped even though I've also been watching my diet and lost weight.
4,Good Value,Recommended by a physician. I've been taking it over 5 years and this is the best price I've found anywhere.
5,Red Yeast Rice clears my arteries,"I take Solaray Red Yeast Rice to help keep my arteries clear. My doctor recommends that I take RYR morning and evening, along with my statin in the evening. I like Solaray RYR because the capsules are easy to swallow and I know the product content is high quality."
4,Solaray Red Yeast Rice,"Seems to work at reducing cholesterol level. Doctor asked me what I was doing differently when my levels went down, and this was the only difference."
5,"Love movies, love food, look no further","A perfect companion to Oscar night, witty and insightful, an essential for anyone who loves to eat and go to the movies (and doesn't everyone???)"
3,What HAPPENED,"This book was okay,but not a Zane great. I know she didn't write all the stories but I found the last story in the book to be the best but not great. I was expecting a book that you can't put down and this book was far from it."
3,Wonderful Read...Stores 1 and 3,"...of all three short stories, i must admit no. 1 was my favorite, then no. 3. However, Love is 2 Blame gave too much non-purposeful detail and not enough climax or juice...its nice he recognize what he wanted wasn't best, but it was lacking significant juice after the 2nd page of Love is 2 Blame. You have potential, just give it to us a bit more...as story 1 turned the heat up, over, and out... and Zane brought it home. Addiction is a beast, and that's what all 3 stories gave; different types yet co-dependent."
3,Love Really is Never Painless,"Sayinf these stories were a tear jerker is an understatement. These stories captured your heart and made you angry with their ending--Such emotions could only be had when an author truly does an amazing job with the characters.Though at times I felt some stories had dragged out before reaching the climax (no pun intended), it was somewhat worth the wait.I would've greatly appreciated if each of these tree novellas were to each become full length novels, which is why I gave it a 3/. I still recommend it!"
5,Love is Never Painless,"I ordered Love is Never Painless for my boyfriend for Valentines day, along with some other books. He really liked the book. We are both big fans of Zane. I haven't read it, but he thanked me, over, and over, for the gift."
4,pretty good,"This book is divided into three stories. It is not the best book I have read, but it's enough entertainment to read from cover to cover. I bought it used for a penny plus shipping and handling was 2.98 so the book was only 2.99. Can't really beat that too much. Overall, the book was good..."
5,Great Read,Once you pick it up you wont want to put it down. It was very hard for me to stop reading to go to bed even knowing that I had to get up very early for work. Excellent book! If you haven't read Zane's other books you really should. Very talented group of authors in this book.
5,Good Deal,"I purchased one of these 7-8 years ago and the unit is still going strong. I was pleased to find that the price on amazon.com was 1/4 the price I paid a local firm back then. The second unit I received today arrived and the quality was the same as the first - well built and working to spec. I ordered a third unit. I use the supplies for HAM radio.Update 19Sept2009: I received a second unit, same high quality as the first and working to spec. The price went up from the first by a few dollars, but was still a good deal."
2,Rug Fixing Book,Not very informative. I already knew all this book offered and was hoping for a couple of secret tips. Book is written for another country and is very old in information on repairing horse blankets. Maybe I will write one of my own.
5,protestan,"this is the best of the best from the world of los guaraguaos [venezuela singers] few nice songs missing but this dvd is a collector gem .from salvadorean people and all the people of the world, were the songs were dedicapted to the suffering people of el salvador on years 1980-1990.fron the civil war and all the world . I love this dvd I recommended."
2,Chewing Up The Scenery,Bruce Dern and Ellen Burstyn overact in every single scene. I really do not understand how scripts like this ever got made. The details are so loosey goosey that no amount of talent could have saved it. A slick talking mob associate is obsessed with getting them to finance his dream casino resort in Hawaii. He drags his brother and two mob floozies into the excitement for a few days. Who cares?
5,I wish she was a baby still!,"I rocked my daughter to sleep with this every night of her first year and it always calmed her. She just turned 4 and I am here to order the cd again (we wore it out), so I can enjoy the rest of the time she will be little. Any parent who buys this cd will have bought the soundtrack for thier baby's infancy!!"
3,BOOK IS ok,"Book is ok...with Susan Gordon citing some real life examples but for the most part she repeats her self throughout the book. Suzanne Gordon is not a nurse but she writes as if she is an expert in the field trying to call attention to the very real issues in the nursing field. Although some of the issues are real and continue to be real in 2009, some of the book is outdated."
1,Skip it,If you want to be told the nursing is an disrespected profession full of nurses that are beaten down buy this. This writer isnt a RN but a journalist who seems out to paint nursing in the worst light possible. She also is in favor of universal health care which was the deal breaker for me.
2,Not bad product,"This just wasn't what i was expecting from Haribo. It is not a bad product, just not what i was looking for."
2,Not my favorite,"I generally love Haribo products. Not this one. I didn't like the flavor or the texture. My son, however, thought they were ""okay."""
2,Apes and other primates,"It's common knowledge among scientists that humans are NOT descended from apes and monkeys. We are descended from OTHER PRIMATES. So why is there a monkey on the package of this candy? I suspect a sneaky, creationist conspiracy of truly major proportions!!!COALITION FOR SCIENCE TO THE PEOPLE (MARXIST-LENINIST)"
3,Perhaps not good for my skin type.,"I had been having good luck with something, but decided to try a new product. I will now be going back to my old standby. This product is fine I suppose, but perhaps didn't agree with my slightly oily skin type. While I suppose my use of it doesn't qualify as a very scientific study on the matter, I found during the time period that I began to use this less desirable face conditions than when using the product I previously had been using. No reaction or anything like that occurred, but I think if you would feel the texture of this solution you would agree probably not best of skin that tends to get oily."
4,"Good, but not the one stop shop.","This is a great basic cleanser, but I have found that a good scrub is also needed before shaving. This won't dry your skin out and won't leave your face feeling squeaky. Pair it with a good scrub and moisturizer and you'll be set."
2,Not worth the price,Nothing really special about this product. It's really gentle on your skin; so gentle that I question whether it's even doing anything. It doesn't even create suds/bubble. It smells nice though and I don't see a difference in the quality of my facial skin. I wouldn't recommend this as a daily face wash/cleanser but give it 2 stars because I support the fight against prostate cancer and I feel it would better suited someone who is Glycolic-ly informed.
2,Not a fan,"Too thin, you need too much to feel as though you've done the job properly. The end result feels okay, just not very user friendly. Would definitely recommend the Anthony Algae Cleanser over this one."
5,Function & quality,Quality ingredients help to make this an effective product for keeping your face healthy. You are worth it. Invest in your health.
3,Boyfriend doesn't seem to like it,I bought a bottle for my boyfriend last Christmas(he's 26 if that matters) and he has only used it probably three times since then. He actually prefers my Neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser. I guess this purchase was a fail.
1,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of both the algae facial cleanser and moisturizer so I was anxious to try this out. I'm surprised this product ever launched. First off, the product doesn't lather up like traditional cleansers and soaps. Second, the product is so runny that it doesn't really stay on your face - imagine trying to wash your face with this stuff dripping off before you evn get a chance to rinse."
3,Ok book,I had a problem staying interested in this book. To many different people to keep track of I think.
5,A Story for Bear by Dennis Haseley,I loved this book! My children loved this book! It is a book that can be read over and over again and enjoyed everytime that it is read. The first time that I read it I had tears in my eyes by the time I finished it. Both the story and the illustrations are beautiful. It makes you wish that you had a cabin in the woods and a bear to read to. It would be a magical day if indeed a story like this could actually be reality.
5,Charming,A tender story with truly exceptional illustrations-- this bear is the most adorable since Sendak's Little Bear.
5,Simply beautiful!,"Me and my husband gave this book to each other on our wedding day, which was April 12, 2000. We both just LOVE these poems. The poems are reminding us of how special the little thing in life are... and how simple it really is to make each other happy if you are willing to make an effort for it. I can really recommend this book to everybody who wants to buy a romantic and useful present for the person you share your life with. Useful, because the poems are like guidelines for a succesful marriage. This is a great Valentine's Day of Anniversary present!"
4,Catch the Big Fish,My goal was to be able to raise nigthcrawlers for my own use in local farms ponds. This book provided good ideas and suggestions.
5,Perfect for my Kitchen,"Both items are 11"" by 16"". Not oversized or too large for your kitchen or oven. Great price for two stainless steel cooking pieces."
1,need more information,"I was considering the purchase of these pans, but could find no mention of their size. Am I to assume they are shown actual size? Or, am I to deduce from the shipping weight (4 pounds) they are huge and will be too large for my oven?"
4,Peace of mind,"I purchased this book as I was begining treatment for Depression and even though it may have ""nothing to do with zen"", the message of the book does bring a zen-like peace when I read it. I would recomend this book to anyone going through tough times."
4,Good but a bit Too personal,"""Everything that happens to me is the best possible thing that can happen to me"".The author uses this powerful statement as a foundation for overcoming stress, dealing with setbacks, and finding happiness in everyday life.How can we change what we believe when our experience has convinced us otherwise? By creating a new experience. The author explains just how to learn to think in a new way to create more happiness in our lives, instead of gloom and depression. I thought the author touched too much on the personal circumstances of him and his family in this book. This book is not perfect, but it is still RECOMMENDED."
3,it could be written in 1 page,"the philosophy is good, but the stories are little too spiritual. I think a good book is that one that makes me fold it every other page and think. this one did it only once. there are much better books out there"
2,A bit out there,"The book is a quick and easy read but is definitely a different approach to things. Basically it takes the entire book to say, ""If you want it, just wish it and it will happen."" Maybe I am a bit too western in my thinking. Interesting read."
1,BEWARE!!! this book is harmful,"This book is awful... it describes an illusion about ""being happy"" through IDEAS from someone is not really educated! FEELINGS were not even discussed! - all the ""author"" did was to SELL HIS OWN CLINIC in malibu, california!!! (not to mention only wealthy people could afford it!) and he's not even a psychologist or anything like it!It is very disappointing to have people out there flippantly talking about ZEN when such a subject should be taking very seriously - even worse, people who think themselves as ""help"" and deal with REAL people with REAL issues... so dangerous.In conclusion, 0 stars (had to put one star to be able to review it).PS. Please read OSHO who truly focuses in the human being as a WHOLE."
2,Too personal,"I liked the overall concept of the book. But Pax's issues/problems are a constant theme in the book. I understand the needs for examples, but at some point (at least to me) it became a self-fulling book that allowed the author to achieve happiness via his son's trails and tribulations. HOw does one make sense out of tragic death? I may have missed this part since after awhile I had to skim the book. I do wish you, your family well and I think that you are doing great work with passages, but please make it not about your issues. And truly understand the really meaning of Zen and now it just applies to you"
2,Falling short of helpful.,"I wanted to like this book (who doesn't want to be a happier person?), so I entertained the author's philosophy as much as I could. In the end though, his advice boils down to an exaggerated ""look on the sunny side"". He also puts so much damn emphasis on ""the universe"" that by the end of the book, it just seems cultish. I mean, he literally speaks of the universe exactly as a Christian would speak of Yahweh or Jesus. Claiming that the ""Universe is perfect, and does no wrong"" and that we should ""acknowledge and thank the universe"". It is as dogmatic as any religion, and thus, just as silly."
5,Life Shifter,This book helped to change my life and the lives of everyone that I gave it to (gave away 4). I'm giving away more this year and reading it again. I wish there were more to it! Going to check out the authors other selections. Everyone that I have given this to reads it over and over and sometimes keeps it in their purse or briefcase for an instant anxiety cure. Reading this book has lead me to read numerous books along the same lines but none as good in the delivery as this one.
5,Amazing shipping!,I have purchased probably about 10 copies of this book and this was my first time using Amazon. I will use Amazon in the future for all book purchases! I saved money and the book was shipped REALLY fast. If you haven't read this book- read it and allow it to change your life.
2,Don't waste your money.,"I was actually really excited about this book but when it came i was truly disappointed at the content. It's like a downgraded version of the secret. don't waste your money on stories of ""think of an open parking spot when you are running late, and will magically appear"" no. not worth 15 bucks. the homeless man down the street can tell me those stories for a quarter -.- lol"
5,"Great little book, easy read",Would recommend to anyone interested in some introspection but not getting bogged down in heavy handed philosophical theory. Well worth the time!
2,Valentine by Taliesin,I love Jime Brickman. I love Taliesin Orchestra. The orchestra has previously done interpretations which were unbelievable. Their interpretation of Brickman was uninspired.
5,Al Gore would approve it and it does keep you warm,"I got this as a preparation for the coming winter and for the big bad utilty rate raise by the local company. It is a simple classic hot water bottle, and it has worked wonderfully so far, the bottle is very effective at retaining heat, it is sometimes still warm when i go to bed the next night. You do need to be a bit careful when pouring boiled water into the bottle, though. I once almost burned my thumbs because I wasn't watching the kettle, but that can be avoided with caution. Overall a great alternative to the heat blanket, and as some other users recommended the water can be recycled as a water for humidifier."
1,not worth the money,This is very small in person. It is just an ordinary small hot water bottle with a fleece cover. Much cheaper to buy the $8 one on offer. This one cost $29.99. I sent it back.
5,A Great 80's Movie!!,"What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's just a great 80's movie and anyone that grew up in the 80's and 90's remember's watching these, it hasn't lost a bit of humor in almost 25 years."
3,Could You Not Tarry One Hour?,"Did not like how long it took for the book to arrive, but it's was in good shape and was fine. We needed it for a class at church."
5,He has cracked the code!,"As a newly saved woman and called of God to be an intercessor, I actually struggled with prayer. I couldn't last more than ten minutes in prayer until I heard of this book. After I purchased it, I employed the principles he listed (based on the Lord's Prayer, Mattew 6:9-13, using the main nine names of God, the Will of God and the Kingdom of God)to pray for people, cities, ministries, etc. His teaching revolutionized my prayer life! It takes me way more than an hour to get through my prayer list. A truly awesome book."
5,Wow!,"I read ,""Interiors"" when it was initially published, let someone borrow it and it was never returned to me, I decided to ""re-read this book"" and keep it safe with me this time. Great read,"
5,Great!!!!,"Amazingly written book...When I wasn't reading the book, I was thinking about it...Wish she would write a sequel to it!"
4,Iyanla's Interior,"I thought this was a very deep and open look at one of our most upcoming women! Iyanlya shared her innermost fears and pains in her life. I respect her for her journey and the obstacles she endured, avoided and conquered to be where she is!I feel this is worthy reading for those who have no idea of how hard life really can be! There is always something we can do about our lot in life. She is truly a blessed healing woman for she has come so far!Thank you for sharing Iyanla!"
5,"Wonderful, inspiring story","I couldn't help but wonder how did you make it through all of this. I truly believe in God and his power to heal physically, emotionally and spiritually. Thank you Iyanla for sharing your life experiences. I believe this was your assignment, and you learned your lesson well in order to help others."
5,Superior,I was and still am being blessed by everything in this book. I refer to this book as much as I refer to my Bible. I have shared this book with both male and female alike and they all thank me so much. Sometimes when you are in a rut and can't find any friend to truly understand or not judge you... this book has helped.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.I am starting to understand myself.
4,"Not as good as the second book, but still good.","I really enjoy the Ultimate X-Men books, but I thought this one was the worst so far for two primary reasons:One Kaare Andrews should stick to doing Disney cartoons and quit the comics buisness. The third and fourth parts to this book look like rejected cells from Atlantis: the Lost Empire.Two, they try to do too much in the fith section, introducing both the Helfire Club (something I feel the series could probably have done without anyway) and the dark phoenix, as well as ressurecting Magneto all in one issue.That being said this is still a great comic, infact the whole series is really inspired. I liked the second and fifth books the best (I thought Wolverine switched sides way too fast in the first book and proteus as a plotline is kind of blah)."
2,down right boring,Normally after i read a terrible book like World Tour I just skip around but since I've always been an X-Men fan I decieded to be leinent. BUT IM SORRY THIS WAS TERRIBLE. Now I'm not even talking story wise I'm talking artwise too. And since I'm not going to make this reveiw long I would really not sudjest this to anyone unless your collecting the entire series like me. P.S this book made forget about goin in order so I went from 1-4 to 18-19 and now 8 and now I'm getting 15.
2,Compiles issues #21-#24 and double-sized #25,"Issue 21 begins the ""Hellfire and Brimstone' story and introduces Kitty Pryde to the Ultimate Universe. #22 explores the Brotherhood of Mutants before degenerating into an uncomfortable fight between Cyclops and Wolverine. The Disneyish artwork and a tired chatroom gag spoil some interesting subplots through #23-#25. Millar's versions of these characters are unlikable compared to those of other Marvel titles."
3,The hideous art really is a problem,"Unlike many others, I prefer the Ultimate X-men to the previous versions, so I don't have much nostalgia for older versions of these characters.The main problem with this volume is the same one that afflicted volume 3: a sudden switch from good to appalling artwork for a few issues really derails the whole thing. The art in 23-25 is just horrible, and I was hard pressed to keep reading through it. Kitty, in particular, is just grotesque.Get the book if you want to fill out your collection. Otherwise, skip it."
3,"Dark Phoenix's Ultimate debut is less than ""Ultimate""","The Phoenix saga is in my opinion in the top 3 most important events in any X-men incarnation. This story is SOO good, that it has become one of a few storylines that is and forever will be in every X-men incarnation (of course the incarnation would have to have Jean Grey in it). Unfortunatley this book makes a mockary of the Phoenix saga. First off, the Phoenix is a god is immense power, no change there. But the thing that [...] me off is how easily Xavier managed to stop Jean(Dark Phoenix). As I recall, the original Phoenix saga lasted many issues, this book turns it into like 5 pages. Dark Phoenix is made into a wuss. I dont care how strong Xavier is, he cannot stop the Dark Phoenix in 5 minutes, OK! This book took one of my favorite characters and made it a cheap little cameo. I hope that the phoenix will be better percieved in future stories. Other than that, it was a pretty good book... hehe..."
5,I am hooked on DHTML,"The reason that I HIGHLY recomend this book is that fact that DHTML development offers a lot of potential, but like me, it is my guess that many of you don't know what that potential is until you see it. Mr. Ruyer's sites and book surely shows that potential off, but as always it is up to you on how you use that development information, either for building a low bandwidth site or for a high bandwidth one, for corporate use or for fun. But understand the reality of ruyers work is not in the eye-catching graphics he created, but in what DHTML technology the graphics are illustrating. This is why I baught his book and why I download his online tutorials and templates, I am trying to expand my understanding of the potential in a free development environment such as DHTML that is supported by the W3 standards association compared to Flash and ChromeEffects which are propietary technologies."
2,"Excellent examples, good description, no originality","The book has some excellent examples and good descriptions for them, just good, not great. Only thing is of the 300 pages, only a hundred or so are original, see, he repeats each script, instructions inclusive, for each project per section. Only thing is each project is only slightly modified from the next. Every chapter starts exactly the same, first page of explanation is of the DOM, EVERY CHAPTER! He does not understand that you only need to explain it in the first chapter, than repeating it every chapter is unnecesary. Very little content repeated many times over. What is there is good though."
1,Two words for this book...,This book really s****! All it was about was making stupid models with Macromedia products and making huge graphics that take forever to download and only work with 1-2 browsers. Waste of money.
1,"Don't waste your time, learn Flash.","interesting read. doesn't explain examples very well. my personal opinion: don't waste your time, learn Flash."
1,A definite NOT!,"This is a really poor example of a DHTML resource. Once you oooo and aaaah at the examples, the book is relatively worthless. The author cut and paste the same information about the same JavaScript over and over into every chapter. Save your money."
2,Repetitive,"This book presents code for accomplishing 16 tasks using combinations of HTML, style sheets, and JavaScript. All examples and graphics are included on the accompanying CD-ROM (which worked fine on my IBM ThinkPad in Win2000). Yes, the tasks, like flashing text, circular animations, and pop-up menus, are rather cool. But are they really necessary? Will they bring more users to your Webpage? My biggest complaint with the book is that Rouyer repeats 4 out of his 10 or 11 steps for each task verbatim in every single chapter, giving full explanations each time. An additional 3 or 4 steps for each task are basically identical, with only filenames or numbers of calls to files different. This book would be a lot shorter and probably a lot cheaper to produce if these steps weren't repeated so many times. If you like to learn from examples, then this book can give you a lot of ideas. But if it's concepts that you're looking for, it will be up to you to find them on your own with this book."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on!,"This book does not deal with reality! High end graphics are way too slow for the Internet. Visiting his site on the net if you are a user with eben a 56K modem, will tell you that the author is off track. Sure, if everyone has T1 lines or Cable modems, ADSL then these techniques could be somewhat useful. But by then 2001-2002 (when 70-85% will have this speed) the bar will be much higher and Microsoft's Chrome will be the standard, not Javascript...or even Flash The Java Script that is provided is not clean and caused some odd behavoir. Pass on this one and wait till Dec or Jan 98 when some new and usefull Flash 3 books will be out."
1,Not very useful,"The book does have a lot of great examples, but that's it. Just examples. It shows you what the author created, and then how he did it. It is not very practical for creating your own DHTML scripts. If you try to create something that he specifically didn't do, you're lost with this book. Definitely not a reference book. I just glanced through this thing then stuck it in my desk and haven't touched it since. Graphics are pretty cool though.."
3,"Great graphics, but limited content","This book is visually enhanced with lots of full-color screen shots and color that separates the code samples from the text. This book focuses primarily on animation and dynamic menus, while there is more to Dynamic HTML. Much of the animation can be accomplished in Flash, but this is a good alternative to paying for expensive software and relying on the end-user to have the appropriate plug-in. This book is one of the few that I originally found to be cross-browser compatible and is very useful and well-documented for the animations and menus. The visual screen shots make it easy to flip through and find what you are looking for ... as long as it's in the book."
3,Light entertainment,"This was a quick and easy read, which was also enjoyable. I did not enjoy it as much as the husband trap, that was by far the best book in the trilogy. In this one the H is roped in to help makeover the h into a marriageable miss, after several failed seasons. The h was not beautiful and the H was of course drop dead gorgeous and brother to the Duke.I can't put my finger on quite why this book didn't grab me. Probably it centres around the fact that I felt that the H didn't esteem the h enough and didn't recognise her as his true love until much too late in the book for me.Anyway it wasn't a bad book and if you want to read the end of the trilogy and catch up on the lives of the characters from the other 2 books, then you'll probably enjoy this one."
4,Nice follow up,"I read The Wedding Trap after The Husband trap and I was not disappointed. Eliza Hammond is Violet's (from the Husband Trap) best friend. She's always loved Kit, Andrian's younger brother, but since she was mainly an unattractive wallflower he hasn't payed her any notice. Eliza though suddenly becomes a wealthy heiress and her friend Violet enlists the help of her brother in law to help Eliza attract worthy suitors. But as Eliza's charm grows day by day with Kit's help, Kit starts to notice her at last but refuses to see it as anything else but lust. Will Kit realize his error before it's too late?I really enjoyed this book and am glad I read it, though the husband trap is still my favorite. Not the most original of stories, but highly entertaining anyway."
5,Loved the Trap Series,"I am a sucker for series and I especially love when the books are released back to back.I also love it when romances echo fairy tales. Eliza Hammand is seen as a plain Jane, and after five long years on the marriage mart, things are looking better. Until her awful aunt dies and leaves her a huge fortune. Suddenly Eliza is getting attention, but the wrong kind. She is attracting the fortune hunters. Then her friend Violet and her brother in law, Kit Winter join forces to polish up Eliza and transform her into the toast of the town.Eliza, who secretly has been in love with Kit for years, goes along with it, if only to be near Kit. A wonderful push and pull flirtatious relationship blooms.I had so much fun with this book that I went back and ordered the other two that preceeded this one. I love a great series, and even though I read the last one first, I know I not be disappointed."
3,Nice maps...somewhat inaccurate history,"I have been looking for a book like this for some time and I was indeed pleased with much of what this one has to offer. However, as mentioned by several other reviewers, the text and the maps often don't seem to go together with the text often omitting information that is displayed on the maps. My biggest problem with the book stems from several glaring errors in the history being presented. For example, the Battle of Fort Necessity is presented in the section about King George's War instead of the French and Indian War where it should be. Also, several maps show errors in locating certain places and events, such as showing Forts Presque Isle and Le Boeuf on maps pertaining to a time period before they even existed. It may not be a big deal, but the little things they get wrong do tend to annoy at times. Otherwise it is indeed a very nicely illustrated book with informative and colorful maps to help visualize the many locations and events presented."
3,Wonderful maps but needs work,"For all its many flaws I rather enjoyed this little book simply because there are hardly any books on the revolution that cover as much. Imagine, Americans have hardly much to read for to understand the war that made them a nation.What little it gives does have informative use."
3,"Heart's in The Right Place, Playing Isn't","I cannot applaud this CD fully because although Mr. Madsen and Mr Wilson play well, Mr. Pavone does not. He seems to have no inspiration or focus - strange considering this is a tribute album to his late friend. It sounds like he is hiding behind the pianist and drummer, depending upon them for improvisational ideas, and musical direction. Mr Pavone's intonation is laughable, and his muddy plucking in the background is amatuerishly disconcerting.Perhaps he should have hired another Bassist to fill in for him on this recording date. He certainly wins no prize here."
3,Better than people had said,"Jazz. He has flimsy arms.Thats about all of the negatives i can say.He's a simple transform, of all of the figures i'd say he's easily the most kid friendly.sure the shield part is of cheese.But i like him. oh so the other problem is he's a low rider. He's difficult to push across the ground.So have fun!of all of the figures, he was the only one that never broke a part off."
3,It's OK,"My 9 year old received this as a Christmas gift. It was hard to find one that wasn't the ""second edition"" from the fight scene of the movie. (I usually find what I'm looking for on Amazon!) He was so excited when he opened the gift but only played with it a couple of times. He's almost afraid to play with it much because upon first look you can tell that it is made out of a very cheap plasitc, as are most of the toys now'days. We have had 2 other Transformer vehicles break after playing with them only 1 time even with the boys being quite careful. As a parent I was really disappointed with the quality. However, the replication is done very well."
5,great tube,good inner tube. i've used it before would buy again if needed.repairs it self fast u dont even know you had a flat.
5,Exotic and Technically Dazzling,"I have always loved this album. It is a pity that WB won't re-release it. I reviewed it for Saturday Review in, I think, 1970. Here's a pull quote: ""The sounds and effects of this album are paced as musical movements and structures within movements. It is exotic and technically dazzling; still it is musical."""
3,Expectations were too high,"Having fallen in love with Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book I had high expectations for Laurel's Kitchen Recipes.Unfortunately this older book just doesn't match up. Sure, it's nice homestyle recipes... but the charm of the bread book isn't there.Her bread book is a favorite -- I bought an extra copy to give as a gift. This recipe book is already been put away."
5,"If you never heard Willy, sorry for you","These are two great albums. If you like your Rock and Roll raw and gritty, with a touch of class, then check out Mink (Willy) De Ville... you won't be sorry, you'll probably wind up buying everything else he ever did."
4,The game plan,This is an amazing review of history and a blue print of the end. This book outlines the agenda of civilization and it's dire consequence. You can't help from not seeing this play out through the current events of today. Communisum is alive and well.
4,The ONLY detailed filmogrpahy book on Lon Chaney.,"Many actors and actresses have had ""The Films of..."" books written about them, but Lon Chaney was always overlooked. Now, Michael F. Blake has written a book to fill that void. The book has detailed information relating to cast and crew, ploy synopsis, critical comments of the day and behind-the-scenes information. There are 120 photos from Chaney's films, many never published before. Chaney's film biography, ""Man of a Thousand Faces"", and a detailed list of unrealized film projects are also included. This book is a necessary reference guide for ALL Chaney fans."
2,Disappointing!,"On a full charge, this battery only lasts two hours! And that's on a good day! It's better than nothing, hence the two stars instead of one. BOTTOM LINE: This item is WAY too expensive to be such a poor performer. I am considering returning this dud. :("
1,"Really, really unresponsive customer service","Setup of the product is really, really easy... but my printer has a problem recognizing the ink cartridges. I have *twice* replaced the cartridges (correctly, of course), and the printer still insists that it has unknown cartridges. I have been trying to contact Lexmark for support, but so far I have been unsuccessful. Calling the 800 number yielded a 1/2 hour wait (so far) and I can't even get their email submission form to load in my browser (times out). I am *very* unimpressed so far, and will be off-loading this product as soon as I can manage. A shame, really. Lexmark was reputed to have good support, but my experience thus far does not support that reputation. Sigh."
2,The Worst Printer I have Ever Owned,"I must agree with other people who have posted reviews on this printer - we initially purchased it for the WiFi capability - it goes down constantly. The paper jams are so frequent I am ready to unplug it and leave it on the street for someone to take. I have tried everything - downloading updates, troubleshooting, etc. Nothing seems to help. I am so frustrated I am ready to get a new printer. Don't bother with this one - it's not worth it."
1,No Leopard driver,"Lexmark does not have a driver for this printer for the latest MAC operating system, (Leopard). According to customer service there is NO PLAN to create one."
1,Has wasted so very much of my time...,"Wireless scanning will work for a while, then fail miserably. Do you enjoy messing with firewalls, reinstalling drivers, etc., etc.? Me either. Seriously a terrible product with sub par documentation."
1,Lexmar X9350 The worst printer i ever had,Lexmar X9350The worst printer i ever hadBecause1. It never worked properly2. During two years I had i have reinstall software at least 10 times for various reason3. color cartridge does not last more than 50 Pages4. network connective issue wireless as well as wired.5. Scanner sucksNever again i will by Lexmark
2,Not happy with printer!!,"The only reason I bought this printer was because it was wireless....I wanted to be able to print from anywhere in my house. Well I have owned it for 2 years and have never been able to set up the wireless to work. I had 3 different compter people try and no one was able to get it to work. The printer would say it was working but my computer wouldn't be able to find the printer. I tried it with 2 different computers..no luck with either one.As a printer I really didn't have any problems with it...it prints nicely, easy to use...I like it ok. It does go through ink like crazy and became a very expensive printer to use.I just bought a Kodak wireless printer...it set up and WORKED wirelessly in about 5 mins!! Doesn't use up ink as fast and the ink cost about 1/2 as much to replace. Print quality is impressive...well never go with a Lexmark again.I do not recommend this printer."
4,I like this printer and thinking of getting another,"Well, I like this printer. I will admit, it's a little complex, but the print quality is great and it prints quickly. Minus the little quirks, I'm seriously thinking of getting another one from my small 3 person office. Still doing the research, but honestly, this is a good printer. Oh, I'll even go so far as to say, it's probably the best one I've owned so far. Also, I like that it is not HUGE and bulky like those Canon Pixma's. I've put my old Pixma up in the attic. It looks good too. All in all a good machine."
2,WiFi doesn't cut it,"I bought this for the WiFi capability, but it goes down constantly. If you disconnect/reconnect the power it usually works, but if I have to get up to do that, what is the point in having wireless. The printer also tells you that you are out of ink, way before you actually are. Other than that it has been alright. Web support is horrible and based on the reviews I am not even going to attempt to call tech support. I'm going to hook it up with USB until I can afford a new printer."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"I initially purchased this printer because it appeared to have great options, and ESPECIALLY because of the wifi capability. I would like to tell you that buying this printer was a huge mistake. When this printer does work its does what its supposed to do. However, the wifi capability is a complete joke. I have spent many hours trying to figure this thing out (and im not a newbie at computers), and I simply cannot connect to the computer wirelessly. If you are looking to do wireless printing, I would recommend purchasing the Apple Airport Extreme Basestation. This is good to purchase because it basically a router that has a USB port on the back for a printer. Thats just my two cents..."
2,A Mixed Bag at Best,"I purchased this CD to update my mono phonograph record of ""Rally 'Round"" which remains one of my favorite Brothers Four albums. ""Rally 'Round"" is one of their earliest albums (second, I believe) and still displays an energy and simplicity that began to disappear soon after as the group became more and more a cover group. The songs are, in general, good and performed well. Thoroughly enjoyable.""Roamin'"" is a totally different story. To me, there are only two songs (""Low Bridge"" and ""Frogg"") that are better than mediocre and ""The Ballad of Sam Hall"" is really distasteful. This album is only tolerable and not recommended by itself.Thus, this collection really is a mixed bag and only marginally recommended -- probably best for die-hard Brothers Four fans and collectors."
4,Job Well Done...,"I attended Junior High School with Denetria, she was singing then and she's still singing. This album is wonderful, and I am looking forward to hearing her future projects."
2,Are We Listening to the Same CD?,"Saints and Friends, I don't want to bump and grind when playing Gospel music. I don't want to feel like I'm on my way to club when listening to Gospel. I also don't want two screeching hens (Champ and Bell) to battle for the mike during a 4 min competition! While I enjoy Sister Champ's voice (when it's toned down and actually being melodious), I don't like this CD. I've heard snippets from the JDI sampler and thought this would be good too but sadly it's disappointing. Sorry Denetria, better luck next time?"
4,Love the Style,"Really enjoy this cd. I had never heard of this artist, but clearly she has a strong voice! Thank you."
2,In the Mood Again,"It's an easy read for the lay person who has little background in psychology. There are some good, concrete suggestions and advice but it lacks substance and depth. It is much too simplistic! I found other books on this topic to be much better."
4,Lighthearted Mystery,"This is a fun, lighthearted mystery with lots of colorful, offbeat characters and Greenwich Village atmosphere. The sleuth is a milliner and while she's solving crimes she's also designing next season's hat collection."
1,WOULD NOT LOAD!!,"Product would not load on my computer. However, my son plays with this at his school, and loves it!"
1,Phonics Read & Rhyme,"Really awful program. I only purchased it because the school also uses it. The Karoke section makes no sense and it says to play a song, but then none of the buttons are enabled to play one. I called tech support and they said this is the way it's supposed to work until the child accumulates tickets. My daughter accumulated all of the tickets, but it still doesn't play any songs in the clubhouse."
4,Crucial book to expand your Russian vocabulary,"This is a good reference book to go to for conjugations and meanings of different verbs.It's extremely important to start reading a few pages a day and memorizing verbs and their meanings.Even if you may be slow at conjugating them, the root of the verb will allow you to understand what people are saying.Sometimes when Google translator messes up the meaning, which is quite common for Russian to English translation, I use this book as a reference tool. I must admit I should use it a lot more than I have had in the past. It's a great book; I highly recommend."
4,"Good reference w/ a pretty worthless collection of ""top 50 verbs""","The book has a lot more typos than I would prefer, but on the whole it does what its supposed to do: be a large collection of conjugated verbs. The top 50 verbs it lists is a peculiar one... don't know why I would want to know four ways of saying to defeat, or three ways of saying to smash/hit!? I would rate the collection of ""top 50 verbs"" as zero stars, and the book with it's collection of 555 verbs as four point five stars."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book for beginning thru intermediate students of Russian. The introduction is difficult to follow, but the verb lists, along with the explanatory texts are very helpful in making sense of the language."
5,A must have.,"A product without ""buts"". You can find in all you need to handle russian verbs. A better option?? A good russian teacher."
5,A Super Book!,"I recommend that everyone dealing with mechanics get a copy of this gem, and read it! It is the most amazing technical book I have read! I don't want to repeat what others have said in their reviews, and so there is not much more for me to say other than that this book has got to be a classic."
1,Incomplete and disappointing,"I ordered the book because I'm interested classical and analytical mechanics for years, and the book had 14 reviews - all with five stars. It supposed to be modern and innovative; I could not wait to get it in my hands. What a great disappointment! Out of 262 pages 70 is not even on the subject; they are devoted to linear algebra (vectors and matrices). Out of modern Analytical Dynamics it essentially covers only one subject: Lagrange equations. The partial list of absolutely essential topics missing from the book includes: Hamiltonian function, Hamilton equations, Poisson brackets, canonical transformations, variational principle, Noether theorem, Hamilton-Jacobi equation!!! As a trained physicist, I completely failed to understand what constitutes the advertized novelty of the book. It is also deeply puzzling how such an incomplete text could possibly receive so many highest reviews."
4,Actually a Horse Story Collection Worth Buying!,"A very good collection of horse stories! I was thrilled to see that I hadn't already read al the stories included. All too often these treasuries of equine literature are just bits and peices from My Friend Flicka, Black Beauty, and other famous horse novels I have already read, both in the complete book and in countless other horse story collections. And while this work includes segments from National Velvet and Black Beauty, most other stories were from less worn sources. Overall, antique yet fresh tales mix with the best of classic equine literature for a delightful new collection."
5,Takes my breath away,"This disk is a truly amazing achievement. It combines heart-felt prayer with unbelievably gorgeous music, and provides an inspiring listening experience. To my mind, the most amazing thing about this music is its nearly universal appeal. People who are not Jewish find it compelling enough that they buy it and play it in their cars and at work.I find it spiritually uplifting and musically accomplished. There is another review here which describes the contents of the disk in detail, so I won't do that. Instead, I will just say that I loved this disk the first time I listened to it, and I like it more on each repetition."
4,Glowing Jewish chants to warm your heart,"In this cd you will find beautiful chants in Hebrew (or Ladino?)and Spanish. The mood is festive and cheerful, the melodies haunting and enthralling. The singers have no American accent whatsoever, which make the chants sound quite real. The accompaniment is sometimes oriental, sometimes a mixture of all kinds of instruments. Although some of the songs are sometimes too modern and sentimental, this is a excellent performance and I highly recommend it if you need music to hearten you and give you a feeling of community."
5,Breathtaking...if you understand Hebrew,"This is a sure hit with hippie types. What really works in it is the beautiful liturgy read with intensity and religious ecstasy. I am not sure how it would sound if you do not understand Hebrew, however, although the melodies, at least some of them, may still be familiar.They also have a Pesach disc that is also wonderful, and always playing in the background around the holiday time at my house! I really love this disc!"
4,"Wife likes it, but the color is a little different than it looks on Amazon.","Like the look of it. The actual product is red, but it looks a different hue of red than the photo on Amazon shows. The color difference wasn't disappointing to us, but we weren't trying to match it to anything. Just liked the hawaiian look."
1,Avoid this revision!,"So there are 3 things this product is supposed to do. 1) Play media, 2) Download cheats, 3) Apply cheats. The media player (on mine at least) works fine, but I'm astonished to find no playlist. So you have to hit ""next, play"" after each song. Hardly worth it. The download (ie broadband capability) doesn't work at all. There are numerous documented bugs in thier TCP/IP implementation and repeated attempts to point this out to tech support have ended in me talking to an answering machine. The ""Apply cheats"" part does work (hince the two stars), but you have to enter each 32 digit hex code by hand. And some games have hundreds of cheats to enter. This was the whole point of buying the ""broadband"" edition. In the end, just buy to non-media player, non-broadband edition since these features are useless in this edition."
2,Disappointing,"Looking for ways to extend my Spanish I like buying instructional CDs since I spend a lot of time in the car and it's a constructive use of that time. About half of the conversations is on CD, with no rhyme or reason as to what makes it to CD and what doesn't."
4,Complete it is,"The Complete Career Anthology is a fine, career spanning collection of one of the old rock 'n roll heroes. The first CD contains tracks of his 'first career', mainly the 60s. The second CD contains tracks which clearly sound more 'modern' and well produced. The highlight of that CD is imo the 80s version of Runaway, especially performed for the TV Series Crime 'Story'"
5,Good standing coat rack,"Nice coat rack, and great price. I like the dark finish as well. It was deliver super fast as well."
2,Have lots of scratches on it!,For whatever reason when I opened the package the color was falling apart on several spots! Although the spots are big but they can be covered with the clothes hanging on it! Not satisfied with my purchase!
5,Good quality,"I was worried that this wouldn't be strong enough to hold heavy coats, but it's sturdy and looks great. I highly recommend it."
1,Returned - item missing parts and not as pictured,"I bought two coat stands - one came exactly as pictured whereas this one was missing a screw and the placement of the rods differed from the photo on Amazon. The missing screw from the rod prevents assembly unless you go to a hardware store and find a similar screw. The placement of the rods was much more horizontal and since the rods were not as thick - we were afraid that they would break off if hanging heavy coats. For these two reasons, we returned the item."
2,nice but will crack with pressure,"I've had this coat rack for three months and really liked it. It looked nice and helped neaten up the entrance to my house. That is, until it got cold out. Once we started putting heavier coats on the rack the bottom cracked thereby making the rack dysfunctional. I thought this was a lemon but after reading many reviews, I see that this is the way this product is made. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on a product you won't have to replace in three months."
1,don't waste your money,"It was on sale so I thought I was getting a great deal. But, it broke within a week, it's in the trash now!"
1,What a piece of junk,"Now, for $25 one doesn't expect wonders. But when, a month after hanging coats on a coat rack, said coat rack COLLAPSES under the weight of coats (which, I assume, is what this coat rack is designed to hold) that's a bit much.Add to that: The seller won't let me return the item because it's been more than a month. And you've got a very unsatisfied customer.Now I'm left with a broken, cheap, useless coat rack. Argh."
3,Cheap,"You definately get what you pay for. Sure it assembled fast, sure it is pretty, but hang more then 3 coats on it see what happens.If you have kids (or a husband) you need something more sturdy, mine lost a leg with in the first week."
1,"Bad quality, not worth the money","Even though this coat rack was cheap, it was still not worth the money. The unit comes with legs that are assembled by sliding them into slots on the stand. However, two of the legs didn't fit in the slots because of sloppy manufacturing. When I applied slight pressure to get the leg into the slot, the wood around the slot split open and cracked up the base of the stand. Now I have to use wood glue and nails to turn this into something usable. I would never buy from this company again."
2,Light Use Only !!!,"I was originally very happy with this coat tree, but I now wish that I had shelled out a bit more money for a more sturdy and better built one. While it is easy to put together and provides easy access to all items with a revolving top, the design is poor and does not handle much weight. One of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use, and because of the design, is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support. The legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole, and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away. Also, the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed. I attempted to use it with 1 winter coat, 2 jackets, a full length dress coat, and 2 hooded sweatshirts, and ended up having to redistribute the items often."
1,Defect product!,"Very poor quality wood used at the first glance. The bottom piece that slides in the leg is cracked when I opened the box. The screws are not straight vertical, and even the wood piece is not straight, so the whole rack is tilted after I assembled!!!How can people hang clothes on such a funny rack? I gave one star just because of Amazon's service."
1,Broken in 2 weeks!,"The main pole cracked at the bootom of center pole the legs attached, and now one of the 3 legs cannot nolngerbe attached. There was no exceesive or improper use, it just fell over one day. I would like a replacent, and will return this.Thnak you."
4,Cherry Coat Rack,"This Cherry Coat Rack looks great, except the bottom peices wouldn't completly go on. Not the Cherry color I was expecting, a little on the dark side. Otherwise for a low price, it holds 4-6 coats and seems to be pretty sturdy."
2,Coat Racks,One of the Cost Racks broke right when a cost was put on it. The Coat Racks are being used at work. i felt bad about that but one of the guys used nails and glue to fix.
4,"looks nice, but not high quality.","pretty nice coat rack. looks very good, but you get what you pay for. that is why i bought a cheaper one, if i wanted a high quality heavy wooden piece then i wouldnt have bought this one. pretty nice for the money."
3,"came fast, but a little cheap looking","It came in the mail very quickly, which is nice, but it looks similar to brown plastic and mine had some dirty pieces in the box. It is a little short, maybe about 5 and half feet tall. Once I wiped off the dirt, it took about 15 seconds to put together, which was nice. It looks good from far away and does the job it was designed to do, so overall I am pleased with my purchase."
3,"It does what it's designed to do, but quality is terrible","The quality of this coat rack can only be described as 5-year-old craftsman in a Chinese sweatshop. However, the design is flawless...it is extremely sturdy and balanced. The only reason why I didn't send it back is because it's a coat rack and no one will be able to see the terrible quality, right?"
5,Great,"The bits fit a bit loosely together around the top, but for the cost, its the best you can buy."
1,Poor Quality!,"The quality of this item was extremely poor!!! The wood was very brittle. In addition, two of the pegs would not screw into it's corresponding hole. I thought I would use wood glue to get the stand to stay up as the base cracked. The glue was not able to keep it together. I looked into returning it, but by the time and money it would take to complete the return wasn't worth it. It ended up in the trash. I've learned my lesson...you get what you pay for!!"
2,Falling apart,If you want a cheap rack you use one time and will never use again. This is the product for you. One of the the legs broke the first time i put it togeather and had to superglue it in place. There are bumps and gashes all over the product and I had to color them in with a black sharpie. I had to use it for my event but then I tossed right into the trash bin. (I whas hoping to have a slightly ok/half nice product but what I got was trash)
2,Cheap,Bought this coat rack to hold 3 coats by the door for the winter. Within the first week the support leg broke from the cheap construction of the leg supports. I would not waste your money on this rack.
1,Horrible!,"This product was advertised as ""new"" however it was in horrible condition. There was scratches and dents all through out the wood finish. One of the three legs on the bottom was cracked, and then had been sealed over with lacquer. One of the pegs screwed in and then with the littlest amount of pressure it came out, leaving the screw inside the hole. It is the worst product I ever bought from Amazon."
3,Coat tree,I bought 4 of these and each one broke. They look great but not made too durable. They don't hold up when you fill them up with very many clothes. Which is what I wanted them for.
1,wrong parts,"For the price I paid for this I was really upset that it didnt have all the parts in the box. On the box was a label stating if all the parts are not here to call this number, seems like instead of printing up that label they could do a little more quality assurance to make sure its right the first time. I needed this by a specific time my wife and I were having friends over, instead the right parts are still not here and I am still awaiting from the company exactly when they will ship. DO NOT BUY THIS, OR FROM COASTER!"
1,be broken when used in 23 days,"It just supported like 2 coats, and suddenly I heard it and saw it bent one of the feet is broken. I do not know what else to say. It is really a bad product"
4,Useable although a bit flimsy,Everything you read on the other reviews are true. It looks nice. It works. It is flimsy. It is not very stable.I use wood glue on the stand when I installed it. I hope that will help last a couple of seasons.
3,You get what you pay for - sort of,"For $20, this is pretty much what I expected. I bought this item because it was cheap, & I was putting it in my basement to hang extra cables and straps for my Bowflex machine. It suits my purposes just fine. But...if you're buying this item to use as it's intended - as a coat rack - you may want to think again. It is cheaply made. The legs attach to the shaft by sliding into grooves, & they're held into place with a small decorative piece of wood that screws into the bottom of the shaft. When I screwed this piece in on mine, the bottom piece of the shaft split. Also, my package - which was sealed and did not appear to be previously opened - only included 4 or the 6 hanging arms. Again, this isn't a big deal for me...I kept it & it's in a corner of my basement doing what I need it to do. But if you're looking for a coat rack for use in your house, spend the extra money & get a better one."
5,"Beautiful, Sturdy, and Inexpensive!","It's super easy to put together! It's beautiful looking, inexpensive, and sturdy -- it hasn't tipped over even though we have about 7 heavy coats on it at any given time!"
1,Broke the second I put it together,"This was the worst quality of anything i have bought ever. Do not buy this. I bought this for my brother for Christmas and the second he took it out of the box for assembly, the pieces didnt fit perfectly and the wood split. Unbelievable. I guess you get what you pay for, but you are wasting your money on this product. I would have spent three times as much for a product that actually had good quality. I wish I could give it zero stars or a negative"
2,You get exactly what you pay for,"Pros: Nicest coat rack you will find for 16$. It's a nice piece of furniture... but...Cons: Exactly what everyone else is saying. Mine lasted about a month before I bumped into it, which caused it to fall over and snap off every single one of its poorly held legs.Other thoughts: I don't know why I torture myself so, but I'm seriously considering buying another one... Every other rack I am looking at seems to be roughly the same quality, but the fact that I'm a tall guy who wears heavy coats means I have to find a sturdier rack. At this point, I'm honestly debating whether I should just make my own, because I am unable to find a sturdy, cheap coat rack."
3,holds lots of coats,"Got this just in time for Christmas dinner, when everyone comes over. I put it in the front hall and all 16 guests were able to throw their coat somewhere on the rack. It falls over if it's not balanced, but it's got to be really unbalanced. Not the best build quality, but if you hide it in the corner or have coats on it, it really doesn't matter."
1,Grief and Support,"AS MUCH TIME AS IT TAKESby Martin J. KeoghFinding a way to comfort someone who is grieving and finding a way to ask for what you need when you are grieving are the two main focuses of this book.It can be a quick read or one that takes as much time as it takes just as grieving takes as much time as it takes. The author gives suggestions and helping phrases, ways to think about grief, ways to accept yourself whether you are the griever or the supporter.It may be a book that the reader reads again and again. The words are wise and carefully chosen. And although it is most importantly written in reference to death of a loved one it can be used to guide oneself in other kinds of grief also.I recommend the book highly. I also recommend that the reader reread it frequently and save it as a reference."
5,"Provides advice in short sentences with large print, making them easy for grieving eyes to see.","How can you support those who have lost a loved one - or how can you yourself survive such a loss? Other books on bereavement focus on either one or the other question or consider specific types of loss - most commonly, that of a partner. AS MUCH TIME AS IT TAKES: A GUIDE FOR THE BEREAVED, THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS offers a wider-ranging approach than competitors, and provides advice in short sentences with large print, making them easy for grieving eyes to see.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,surprisingly good!,"I was deeply impressed with this volume. Golden Dawn style magick is sometimes hard to come by, Regardie's ""The Golden Dawn"" is a reference book. You would be hard pressed to learn from it and Cicero's ""The Essential Golden Dawn"" is billed as a magick textbook, but it is a history book, nothing more. But finnally Cicero delivers with Self-Initiation. If you want to learn the basics of GD this is the one to get."
4,Not exactly a begining book.,"This is an excellent book, but it's not exactly a begining book. I have read and own many other books on both occultism and visualization techniques, and I found this book to be excellent but I guess it would be intimidating for someone who has never had experience with the subject matter before. If you're interested in the golden dawn tradition, this is probably not the best book for learning the basics, as its definitly not a basic book in and of itself. I bought this as I have an interest in GD, but Im afraid that for now I have to shelve it and go in search of a more basic text. But I will be coming back to it."
4,Very complete... but very complex,"A excellent and serious book about self initiation in the Golden Dawn magic system. But it's very complex too. This big book will teach you a lot of details about magical things and cosmogony, through a one or two year's ""evening class"".But it doesn't explain you the spirit of this magic and the GD philosophy.It's not a easy understanding book, and definitly not a fast magick grimoire :)"
3,GOOD BOOK BUT....,"When one first picks up a book with the Title of ""Self Initiation"" He/She is not expecting to have to have a 4 year collage degree in occult science. Most people who seek to understand the Arts of magick are just as lay as a kid with only a 9th or 12th grade education. This book is filled with great information on the arts of magick and its history and points of view but it's worse than picking up the good book written completly in Hebrew. I bought the book because I am interested in the operation of golden dawn magickal studies but after the first chapter I had to put it on the shelf because of its many complex and confusing terms. great for the advanced student but not for the begainner."
4,Excellent? Yes. Practical? MAYBE,"Self Initiation is an excellent presentation of material available in Dr. Regardie's Golden Dawn made accessible and easy to understand. Included are the oral lectures on the Hebrew letters and excellent presentations of the material in question. The Neophyte ritual is excellent but in serious need of simplifcation. The elemental rituals. The flaw with this book is the elemental grade rituals. They are way too complex. A better presentation would have been a variation of the Watchtower Ceremony specializing in the element. My suggestion is this, get this book for the Neophyte ritual and knowledge lectures, then use Modern Magick as your pacing. Each lesson in Modern Magick is 2-3 months of work and engages you in elemental work starting with Chapter 3. Otherwise, the book is just too danged expensive to work through, but not to buy."
1,"Outdated and slow, leading to little Magic.","Seeing as there are many other effecient and productive magical systems avaliable for study, it baffles me as to why anybody would want to waste their time crawling along with this one.If you want to actually DO some magic, rather than simply considering it, or stopping short of really trying it (as this course does), then look elsewhere. I suggest Donald Michael Kraig's superb ""Modern Magick"" if the GD tradition appeals. At least Kraig's book gets to the heart of the WHOLE POINT for doing it in the first place, unlike this volume, which only discusses it in scared little whispers.Magic has moved on, and it's time that fact was recognised once and for all.So... don't buy this book, unless you like the picture on the cover."
3,Missed it by that much,"As has been stated in the other reviews, this is a reissue of a comedy/spoken word LP from the 1960's. If you like that album, then you'll like this CD. The Feldon 45rpm cuts were a nice touch for those who couldn't find a mint copy of that record...BUT be warned! if you think you're getting the actual broadcast version of the theme to Get Smart as a bonus track, you will be VERY disappointed. The version on this CD is from the ""Television's greatest hits"" collection which is a poor knock-off of the original.Minus two stars for using that inferior cover of the Irving Szathmary penned theme.*It must be noted that the original theme does exist on the album but is not a complete version as there is dialogue over most of it."
4,Soulful blues very well done,Her voice is almost haunting it is so beautiful. While not normally my type of music as I like things louder with more rock - I heard this on Jango and had to have the CD. It is well written and she has an amazing voice.
5,a great album,"This is a great album, and it's unfortunate that it's so expensive in hard-copy form.If you like Lauren Hoffman or you've heard and enjoyed some of these songs (""Reasons to Fall,"" ""The Ghost You Know"") on South of Nowhere, I'd suggest you look for the album on emusic or itunes, where it's more affordable."
3,Do Carmo's is better,"I've taught an introductory differential geometry course from Lee's book, and in retrospect Do Carmo's ""Riemannian Geometry"" would have been a better choice. To be fair Lee does masterful job introducing basic concepts from curvature to Jacobi fields, but here are a few things I disliked. The book assumes working knowledge of smooth manifolds and Lie brackets, while many students need review of the former, and know nothing of the latter. Lee doesn't give enough examples beyond constant curvature spaces: there is virtually no mention of warped products, Riemannian submersions, Lie groups, or homogeneous spaces. Exercises are few, unmotivated, and their difficulty is in stark contrast with the easiness of the main text. I feel Do Carmo's book is superior in all respects, and last time I checked it was not much more expensive."
4,Teen Idols fans only,"I'm a big teen idols fan and I really enjoyed their tracks on this cd. The first two tracks are decent, and the next two are some of the best teen idols you can hear. Sure, 20 below is also found on pucker up, but with the band breaking up, there are three non-album tracks to get right here. And they're good tracks."
5,great grip,"A robust grip at a great price, and it even comes with a very nice rail. I hack sawed off about 1 1/2 "" of the handle and mounted it on a tactical pumper. The difference in usability is stunning. Try it. You'll like it!"
4,Perfect for 8-9yr old birthdays,"This is the product that not all boys know about, but I think they all love. Its kinda gross, but yet they have to take care of it for two weeks, feeding it and giving it air. I would recommend, I bought 4 and keep them on hand for birthdays."
2,lightup timer toothbrush,Slow and costly shipping. Manual toothbrushes. Timer only 1 minute. Suggested brushing time is 2 minutes.
2,Impossible with Vista -- Poor customer support,"This unit worked flawlessly with Windows XP. With Vista... Nothing. KWorld replaced the dongle and sent some hand-labeled software without any instructions and the result was... Nothiing. Repeated inquiries to KWorld produced... NOTHING! If you are using XP and want to watch NTSC only, you couldn't find a better product. If you have Vista, forget it."
1,Tiger Electronics=bad dealer,I tried to buy it and completed the order accordingly. Two days later I saw a refund for not being able to process my order. I tried to contact the dealer but never received a reply.
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this item in amazon and it not only didn't work,but also screw up my windows media, now I can't see videos on my computer because of the software this thing put on your computer.There was never a TV signal on my computer, I tried everyone of the possible configurations and also used a really potent antena (not to mention that I'm in the middle of the city) and it didn't work. I'm sending back mine wo I can get back SOME of my money, but I've already spent about $30 in shipment and now I don't have a way of getting a TV receiver of the world cup on time.Believe me, you don't need to waist your money and time buying this kind of stuff."
5,Perfect !!,Perfect with cable. No idea about the performance with antenna. Picture quality is great. Didn't try capturing....I am satisfied and five stars!! No problem with the installation CD. I didn't download anything from the internet. If it has a problem with scanning channels just check the cable before you do anything else. Buy with confidence.
3,Do not use the installation CD,"Go to their website first and download the driver (install first) and then the new PVR. This may solve some of your problems. This is buggy software, good luck."
4,Good for the money,"The TV-tuner works reasonable well, although sometimes the syncronization of picture and sound is not perfect. I couldn't see, if it was prepared for stereo sound, but I only got mono. To use MPEG4 for the DVR-recorder you have to get the MPEG4-decoder from Microsoft. I did, but did not manage to make it work. The Microsoft Media Center does not recognize the tuner as it is not certified for MMC.All in all - i did not expect miracles considering the price, and it works well as a tv-tuner. I might have used a little more money on a better model, if I had known how convenient it is to have tv on your laptop."
4,A rousing swords and sorcery tale,"Zelazny is best known for his AMBER series, as well as LORD OF LIGHT. DILVISH is a compilation of several short stories that Zelazny wrote so each section is broken into different chapters. The pace moves well enough but not as is expected today in the typical 1000 page fantasy epic.That said there are several fantastic elements in these stories which I rarely find in later fantasy novels so, for that alone, the reading is worth it.Remember, his best tale would be the first five books of AMBER and DILVISH, THE DAMNED is somewhere between pretty good and good, but not great, like Amber.Moorcock's pulp stories, which were later put into slim novels, is similar in pacing to that of DILVISH, THE DAMNED."
4,This is off of the book's back cover.,"The Road From Hell... Escaping from Hell was only the beginning for Dilvish and Black, his demonic metal horse. Finding Jelerak, the evil sorcerer who sent him to two hundred years of torture, was the only thing that interested him. But Fate had other plans. The armies of Colonel Lylish attacked his homeland, and only Black could carry Dilvish through the enemy lines to warn the king. The city of Dilfar was under siege, and only Dilvish, descendant of Selar, could raise the ghostly legions of Shoredan and bring them to its aid. Then a damsel in distress cried out for his help-but really wanted his blood! Twin sorcerers needed him as a pawn in a deadly game for power. An ancient, forgotten goddess tried and failed to stop his quest for vengeance, while a werewolf almost succeeded. Then, when Dilvish finally climbed to Jelerak's stronghold in the tower of ice, he found nothing but greater perils separating him from his ancient enemy."
5,dewalt chop saw,i bought this saw several months ago and have used it extensively. it is the best piece of equipment i own.would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a really good saw
5,"Great tool, great buy","It works like a charm, was easy to setup, simple to use. I bought a saw stand to go with it which makes for a great setup."
2,Not up to standards,"I ordered the product at a great price with a nice Amazon discount running at the time. Unfortunately, even though the packaging was undamaged, the base of the saw (aluminum) was cracked.I wanted to get a replacement, but was told that was not possible (none available). Amazon did quickly refund the entire purchase, including return shipping. However, it is pretty disappointing to see that shortly after I returned the saw, they had them for sale again (at a higher price). They would not sell one at the original price.I will look elsewhere for my miter saw."
1,Didn't last!,"Purchased for our teen son. Basic use - not hard on it. It lasted just a few months . . . after that, it would not load or play any DVDs. Cheaply made? Should replace it, but not sure what brands are more reliable in portable DVD players."
1,Only last for 1 trip,"I bought this for a long road trip less than two months ago. It worked great on the trip. We brought it home and sat in on a shelf for about a month. We just went on another road trip and went to turn it on 5 min. into our drive only to find that it would not work!! I want my money back, it only last 1 vacation!!"
4,I like it.... even if I can't really explain why ;-),"First thing you notice: this record is on Tzadik. For those unfamiliar with this label it means that you're handling either noisy thash jazz/japanese hardcore or avant-garde stuff. I love this sort of things but if you're accustomed to more ""terre à terre"" listenings... you might want to try your luck at something else. Ruins are (most of the times) a drums-bass duo, playing some sort of japanese prog-rock! Regardless of what the critics say on the matter, music of this kind is unreviewable, you either like it or thrash it (literally) and both resolutions can be extensively reasoned. So why lose our time? Hear a few samples and see for yourself!"
2,Vauge In a lot of areas,"I purchased this book to make repairs on my 1995 T-Bird 4.6l dohc V8. The book has a section dedicated to this engine But in many areas it is very Vague. This is a complicated engine and more detail needs to be illustrated on things such as valve timing, as well as component placing, and how to's.Needless to say, I was very disappointed in my purchase.Ron"
3,Standard Haynes,Meaning it has out of date information. Needs to be used with the factory CD for best results.
4,Haynes Manual,"The manual spends too much time on the rare need for a complete engine overhaul and then spends too little attention to things that the typical owner needs to do. Not unique to Haynes, just a common problem. Sadly, did not really get to use the manual. I ordered it to deal with a problem, but delivery took so long I had to get one form another source so I could get the vehicle back on the road."
3,Ford Thunderbird Mercury Cougar Repair Manual,I like to have all the information I can get in reference material on vehicles I am restoring.
3,Nice background music,"I must admit that I was slightly disappointed in this CD. I bought it based upon some songs i heard on radio, which were very nice...But the CD as a whole becomes a little tedious to listen to, with the same type of sound repeated over and over. I don't like the fakish strings/brass ensemble used as accompaniment - sounds like cheap synth sounds to me, the guitaring/song structures are very nice though and enjoyable to listen to. Were I to make a buying decision knowing what I know now, I would have bought just a few individual mp3's from this CD...Notably Passion, Magico, Mystical breezes, Mi Guitarra..."
4,Helpful,"I must be honest, I have not read the whole book but the parts I did read were very helpful and factual. This book covers the basic concepts and takes you through a plan of how to organize your thoughts into a well formed essay. Overall a helpful resource."
5,For your listening pleasure.,"Great cd exhibiting the talents of artist Bill Henderson. Smooth and interesting interpertation of classics, including an outstanding version of ""Joey, Joey, Joey"". A splendid additon to the library of lovers of jazz vocals."
3,fair product,"I've been using this pack for over a year, for commuting as well as for travel. There's plenty of room inside, and the laptop zipper is convenienent. Inside, there are lots of useful compartmants, a pen-holder etc. the outer compartment is useful for last minute things. Easy to clean - I have had yogurt and sunscreen explosions which came right out. The material has help up perfectly despite fairly rough use. Protects laptop very well (13.3"" and 15"" macbooks). It's not the most comfortable backpack though. The straps on this tend to ride on the outside of the shoulders, making them prone to slip off. The lack of a sternum strap makes this worse. The pack tends to ride away from the back, rather than lower profile."
3,Too many embellishments for my taste,"Phillip Dyson is certainly an excellent pianist, and the selection of Joplin tunes on this album is pretty good. But when listening to album, I find myself frustrated at the number of embellishments and liberties that Dyson takes with Joplin's original music.It's a matter of taste, I guess, but I much prefer renditions of the music that are true to what was written by Joplin. For more faithful performances of Scott Joplin, get Joshua Rifkin's album instead."
4,Worth a Listen,"Came here to buy a track but none are available. This is an Irish piano/violin duet although 3 of the tracks have a woman vocalist. I've heard a few of the tracks on last.fm. I was after The Butterfly/Watermans. Also I like Cowboy's Jig and Ja Va Lidijgn Horra / The Ghost's Welcome / Brendan McGlinchey's. They are all lively with great melodies and rhythms, and she is great on the fiddle. The other tunes are very pretty, more traditional, from the samples. Some really beautiful celtic music though."
5,Not sure what to get?,If you liked Black Reign then you will love this CD. I listened to a few latifah cd's here and there but after I herd this cd I hooked.this is definetly the cd to get.
4,very easy book,"This was a very easy book, made me long for my days of girl/high school drama. It was frustrating with all the nonsense that these people created and yet so funny at the same time. I recommend this book because of its very easy plot and good humor. I do have to say I absolutely hated Renee and I would have liked more to the ending."
1,bad read,"this book was recommended to me by a friend. I recommended it to my book club. Most of us hated it...the women in the story were whiney women and even by the end of the story, I could not discern one from the other. They did not handle their marital problems in the adult sense. the men were no better. I felt bad I had recommended it to my peers. I will not be inclined to read any of this author's books. I do not like her style. It was not an easy reading for me, as it was painfully slow and boring!"
4,Great concept,"Finally, a chick lit book that is enjoyable and fun to read. Its been a long time....Beth Kendrick has written a witty, different chick lit book. Story of three women who get married at the same time only to realize that they are not really married. This gives each of them pause - do they REALLY want to ""remarry"" the same man?The storyline is fun to read and because it is different, the author can go places with the storyline that regular chick lit could not.It actually made me question a few things myself. When you get to know the guy you love - really get to know him - if you had a choice, would you stay married?Written in a nice breezy manner - smart, funny and touching at times. I found myself angry, entertained, and very interested in reading what comes next.Buy this one."
4,Much better than I had expected!,"It's not that I felt this book would be bad...I wouldn't have bought it otherwise. I just expected it to be okay, and kinda entertaining. It was great though! I found myself drawn into the individual stories, and really connecting with the characters. The only thing I didn't like was the way the book was written, with the point of view changing between the 4 women. I understand why it was done, but I early on I kept forgetting who was who, and what their story was, which was kind of distracting. Really though, it was a great book with a great ending, and I'm glad I read it!"
4,perfect holiday book!,"I purchased this book for my holiday overseas and it was perfect! I finished it in one day as it was such an easy read and the characters were so likeable.The different viewpoints and how the stories become interwoven made it interesting, and I enjoyed that each character had their flaws - it made them more realistic while still keeping it all simple and an easy read.It would be perfect Plane Fodder for those long flights!!!I can't wait to get another one of Beth's books for the flight home...."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"I loved this book! Every page I laughed soo hard. I wish they would make a movie. I read all the time and my favorites are books that keep my attention, and this one definately did. I read it during my slow periods at work and I could not put it down. I recommend this to anyone who loves Beth Kendrick or Sarah Dessen. Great book."
3,Irritating but Worthwhile,"This book is poorly written - the English is sloppy, imprecise, cliched and New-Agey. The concepts are often half-buried under the turgid prose and it's all too easy to dismiss this book as illiterate nonsense. But... with some patience, the reader will discover that under the rather silly and facile surface lie some worthwhile ideas. For anyone seeking to improve their relationship, rather than just move on to the next one in the hope that it will somehow be better, this is a book worth persevering with. Ideally someone should re-write the book in real English, and extract the key ideas and present them in a way that is clear and intelligible at all times, but until that happens it's worth struggling through the current text because it really does offer some useful approaches and enables you to arrive at insights that otherwise might remain dormant. But really, it does cry out for a halfway decent job of editing..."
4,Severe eczema on baby,This item was recommend by a sales person In a pharmacy in London. It is the best lotion I could use on my baby. He has severe allergy to cow's protein and generally suffers from dry skin. This product beats all the other products I have tried.
5,FANTASTIC Multi-Purpose Loaf Dish!!!,"Excellent baking dish for all the usual purposes. Stands up very well under daily use for years. Though my number one, favorite use for this pan (w/lid) is to store homemade ice cream; it's THE PERFECT size, shape, etc. for this task! Of course it works wonders for storing leftovers in limited fridge space, too.I wish Amazon would offer this item again so I could purchase several more."
5,"INCREDIBLE, I TELL YOU!!","You have heard the rest, now listen to the best. Lisa's words will touch you (guaranteed) in ways that you never thought possible. Her life experience's written in song will touch every bit of your emotions. Every time you turn the corner there is an experience that Lisa details that you most certainly have exerienced at least once in your life. From the solid folk guitar work to her angelic but homebound voice, you will find yourself lost from start to finish. This CD extends beyond the 5 stars that they allow here on this review board. Find out for yourself why so many have turned there heads Lisa's way and say: ""There but for the work of the devil, go I"""
3,OK,The balls seemed to help me a little but didn't help the real problem which is my wife's back and sciatic.
4,My own little miracle.,"I discovered The Miracle Ball Method while I was going to my physical therapist. She had told me about the balls and how they had helped patients with lower and upper back pain. I was a little skeptical about laying on balls and had no clue how they were going to make me more flexible and relieve my back problems.However, these balls have helped with my lower back tightness and flexibility since beginning with them in June 2012. I have consistently use them (3x week) and my back feels much better when I use them on a schedule.I purchased a kit and she recommended me reading through the 200 page book. 200 pages? Are you kidding me? I skimmed through the sections that I felt were vital to my back's needs at the time. I have gone through the book now after seeing what these can do. My back has experience greater flexibility and I recommend them to anyone who is skeptical on using them.I wish I would have found them before my physical therapist!"
1,Order Not Complete,The two miracle balls were not included in the shipment...only the paperback book. It was not worth the effort to report the error. I ordered from an alternative source..at a significantly lower price.Dona Strickland
1,short change,"I did not recive the balls , therefor am not able to review this product.The Miracle Ball Method: Relieve Your Pain, Reshape Your Body, Reduce Your Stress [2 Miracle Balls Included]"
1,Chemical material very dangerous for pregnant woman and household with infants!,"First of all, you can try all the exercises for pain relief and they didn't work out for me, second is that in any place I would touch the ball, because at my place I painted everything with less chemical as possible, the ball would remove the paint from any furniture or wall, making a mass and risking my under 1 year old baby.I needed to through them out in the garbage, what a waist of my money."
5,It really is amazing...,"I read up and used these balls as directed and have experienced relief from muscle tension, chronic neck pain, sore back muscles, etc. I highly recommend them and have purchased extra ones for gifts."
5,Unbelievable!!! I Feel Like I Won the Sweepstakes!,"Elaine Petrone definitely has a new fan club president in me if she needs one. I am in awe of my great good fortune to have come across this amazingly simple system--it is going to save me a bundle in chiropractic bills. After just one day, I can tell a huge difference. It feels like my shoulders dropped 3 inches from all the stress that was gently released and my breathing is so much more relaxed and deep. I had more energy yesterday than I've had in months after one enjoyable time relaxing on these balls. And the instruction book is well-written and user-friendly.And today I've noticed that I am becoming aware of my stomach muscles tightening up. This is a GOOD thing!Want to guess what every single family member of mine is getting for their birthday this year?"
1,These ATE my wood cabinet!,"They ATE my wood cabinet in FIVE days! I have pictures. I hoped these might help with worsening chronic everything pain caused by an old accident, 13 years behind a desk, two pregnancies and hauling small kids. They still might if I pull them out of the box I shoved them into keep them away from anything with a wood stain/veneer and the kids. I am NOT one of those people who says every chemical is out to kill us (even if some of them really may be...), but these scare me. I stored them in a cherry wood cabinet and after five days they ate through the poly down into the stain on every contact point. The stain then stained the balls (obviously) and has left a constantly sticky black film that won't wash away or even smooth off. Please keep these away from anything or anyone of value. What ARE these made out of? I read a review saying the same thing before I bought these and wrote it off as a fluke or chemical neurosis. You were right."
2,my balls are better.....tennis or lacrosse balls,"my balls are better. These balls are to squishy. I like harder balls for better theraputic massaging. Get tennis or lacrosse balls, much cheaper."
1,Miracle Balls,The add said 2 miracle balls included. They were not. The ignored my email asking about it. So overall not happy.
1,Two balls and no book,I get the impression from other reviews i have read that what you are buying is a book with two miracle balls thrown in for free.What I got was the two balls in the box. Nothing else.I really dont know what Iam supposed to do with these balls.
2,reader,"The ball exercises are helpful, but they are only one part of the total package.If you suffer from any kind of back pain you need more than just these to overcome and get stonger. If you have never tried ball exercises this is not bad. There are other books on the market with more to balance your workouts."
4,Ball Therapy Works,"Ball therapy one of the most amazing ways to get natural relief from pain, It's admirable that Elaine Petrone took the time to write about it. This book can get you started on a ball therapy mission and awareness that will thrill you with the results you experience. The 2 balls that come with this book are good; however, you can discover if you are so inclined that there exist countless additional balls (sizes and types) that work as well or better."
5,Great,This little ball relieves pressure in the lower back and I take one in my suitcase when I travel. Love it!!
2,Gimmic-- Just get some tennis balls,This item is a gimmic but if you want to learn the hard way go ahead and purchase it. It will got straight to your closet for storage or pile of stuff you dont use. It will only add clutter to your house.
4,Some relief from back pain,"I have some knots and general tightness in my back and was looking for something that might be helpful. I considered some of the back alignment products but hesitated because of the price. Since it costs a fifth of the price of a single massage I decided to try this product. I've only used it a short time, but feel that it has made a small positive difference."
5,The Miracle Ball Method,I love the balls!!! I carry it when I travel and use it to help keep my body align\balanced.
4,Good product.,"This is a good product and I like it. It does take some will power and effort to use, only because it ~feels~ like I'm not getting as much done as I would be with something more active. But it's amazing how much concentration and effort it takes to relax, when I really follow the suggestions in the accompanying booklet. And the benefits are worth the effort. I'm never disappointed by the results when I put in real time and energy (BREATHING and CONSCIOUSLY relaxing)...I just need to do it."
5,"Get relief, even for lazy people like me.",I've been using the miracle balls for years and they are great. I have fibromyalgia and nerve damage and they definitely have helped relieve the pain as well as relax my muscles. I'm a little lazy and there is a book with the breathing method you are supposed to do but a lot of times when I am just sitting around watching tv or reading a book I'll put one of the balls in a place thats tight or painful and let the ball do its majic. This method has helped in so many ways- there's even a position to put the ball in that helps insomnia and believe me it works. I recommend this to anyone- healthy or sick. It's wonderful!
5,Worked for me!,I recently bought a house that is a bit of a fixer upper. With all my pain in my neck and back I wasn't sure how I'd be able to fix anything. 15 minutes at the grocery store is about all I can usually handle. I found this book on accident and decided to give it a try. After two days on the balls I set out to put a hard wood floor in my kitchen. after 5 hours the only real pain I felt was in my knees and some sore muscles. My neck and back were ready for more work. I could care less if someone else has been teaching this method and calling it something else. That book doesn't come with the balls. This worked for me and I can't see any reason it wouldn't for for anyone else.
3,"Not quite miracle, but helpful","Just a suggestion on this product: start out easing into it. Too much too fast will put you in pain, but with starting gently for a very short time you can find relief. It really has been helpful with sciatic pain using one or two balls in the lower back/sacariliac area. I've wanted something like these balls for a long time as I sensed that putting pressure on a spot by lying on a ball could help. They do work. Worth the price."
2,not as I expected,"I was so hopeful that this would work. When I used the balls, I found it painful and was very sore the next day. Might not be for people with fibromyalgia. I might try again but I'm a little wary."
3,Somewhat pleased,"I was somewhat disappointed with the book that accompanies the Miracle Balls. It is hard to follow the directions to perform some the techniques. Overall, I believe this product serves its purpose, however it could be better."
3,Overdose on Miracle Balls??,"So, I still have full confidence in these balls...and am going to try them again. I tried them for the first time last night and more than likely spent much more time on the ball than I should have. It felt so good to have the pressure relieved when I was on the balls but I'm so sore this morning!!!Any advice? I'm going to try these again, for less time, once I can move again!!"
2,These little balls did very little to help my pain.,"I am disappointed with this product. Most of the exercises are basic stretches, which do not require the balls. The balls do feel good while using them, but do not provide relief beyond that. In fact, I'm not so sure that they don't make painful areas worse. The smell of the balls is horrendous. I have no idea why everyone has written so many good reviews. I've had several of my friends try them out also and they think that they're just a waste of time. I would certainly not purchase again."
2,Too painful for this Fibromyalgia sufferer,"The Fibro pressure points along my lower back and hips are particularly sensitive, so the idea of using a ""squishy"" ball that you ""sink into"" sounded very promising. To me the balls felt like a soft grapefruit -- not exactly what I consider squishy -- and were really too painful for me to use for any length of time.Although I couldn't really give the balls a fair test I did give it two stars for the book's breathing and relaxation techniques, which I found very helpful."
4,Great Addition to my workout.,"I was recommended to try the MBM by a friend. At first I thought this soft ball is going to help? It has. They were so effective for me, I sent them to a friend. She looked at them and thought they were worthless, but is trying them to find her own zone. That is what is was like for me. They definitely helped me to relax, release stress in isolated muscles, especially my hips and lower back and assisted in my mobility. I used the instructional guide and kept focusing in on areas that helped me the most. I am 53, 5ft 3"" and 115 pounds. I recommend."
3,great for your back,"I had borrowed a miracle ball from a friend when my back went out, and it really is helpful. The miracle ball I purchased was under-inflated and the packaging was cracked. After inflating ball, it is fine."
3,Have not noticed improvement,"Have been trying this product for about two weeks now; however, I have not noticed any improvement in my back yet. I find the balls to be a bit uncomfortable when placed just two inches above or below certain areas. I am hoping for long-term results, but have yet to be impressed. The one good thing is that it does allow you to stop, slow down, and breathe... which may be its best benefit."
5,Sure helps you relax,"I have a very bad back, and I try and stretch everyday so I can keep moving. These balls, placed according to the simple instructions in the book, help me to enhance my stretch and relax my very tense muscles. I have constant back pain and altho the pain has not gone away I am able to move better after practicing these techniques. I've had several back surgeries so my experience may not be the same as for someone who has not undergone the spinal fusions that were supposed to ease my pain."
5,Great product,Got this product really fast and it has worked wonders for my body. My pains have lessened and I recommend it for all.
5,Release back tension and ease pain,"The Miracle Ball method really works. That's all I have to say. It's very helpful for back pain. It actually eases the tension in your muscles. You need to find the time to do the exercises, but they really, really work. It's a miracle!! Even my chiropractor concurs. I highly recommend this product and I will continue to recommend it to anyone who has back problems."
1,Didn't work,It hurt like crazy and I couldn't get the ball to stay in place so I don't recommend. Others like it because a friend recommended to me but I was unhappy because I couldn't use it.
4,The Miracle Ball method,I actually I got it for a friend..she was given the ball but did not have the book. She really liked it.
5,Great product,"I'm a massage therapist and this product helped me to take care of my patients (most of them have been through a car accident), with excellent results, when it is too painful to receive deep tissue massage. It has the advantage of targeting muscles and fascia (connective tissue) deep into the hips and thorax, so it helps me to give a very complete treatment. Just a note, I ordered some of the used method, to have one set at every office I worked at, and the books came without the miracle balls."
3,Miracle Balls,"Found the book and balls extremely helpful for my back and many of my students. One of my balls deflated after 2 months. I have registered a complaint to the seller, with no response as yet. Other than that I would highly recommend them."
2,untitled,"Perhaps I didn't read the product description carefully enough, but I was disappointed with this product. The kit did come with the ball and a book, but the book was a short ""cardboard"" type. The exercises were few and poorly described. The book contained no new or remarkable information. Definitely not ""miraculous"". pat"
1,useless,"Sorry, but perhaps I am missing something... there are two little soft bolls. that's it:)... I can't feel them;).. I tried tennis balls and liked the feeling of pressure better..."
3,The Ball,I heard about this from a few people and bought it at the store. While the exercises are helpful a little- it is not a cure all. It will help your painful spots if you get it in the right place and roll just right other wise it will not help or aleast not for me. I tried a tennis ball in a sock and it worked just as well and the exercises are fun to use but for resolving pain we all need to do exercises.
3,Only for the truly lazy,"I bought this to help with my going back, hip, shoulder issues. They are ok for pain control. The book that comes with it is too small to hold and read. Basically the balls are for use on trigger points. I use them to help with knees while I do Yoga.I much prefer the Body Rolling system, combined with Yin Yoga. Body rolling adreess the structure problem that causes pain. These balls mostly address just trigger points, and the aurthor does not explain trigger points very well.I suggest you try Body Rolling, instead of Miracle balls. You will not reshape your body with these!good luck in the search for the pain free world!"
1,this miracle ball method didn't work for me,"This miracle ball method didn't work for me after one week try.It may work for some people, or some kind of back pain."
1,Take the negative reviews seriously,"I decided to try the miracle ball method because it was relatively cheap with good Amazon reviews, I didn't read the negative reviews closely enough and I wish I had, they are totally right! The balls are cheap, smell bad, and after following the instruction booklet perfectly, my back feels WORSE than it did before. Not to mention the fact that its difficult to follow along with a book, a DVD or audio track would be more helpful, now I need a massage and probably a chiropractic appt just to recover from a couple days with this so called ""method""."
4,helpful for migraine relief,"I recently purchased this set to help with pain and stiffness due to arthritis. In settling down to read further into the book I wound up feeling like I was about to get a migraine *again*. I recalled one of the reviews I had read before purchasing the set had mentioned that putting the ball behind his/her neck had helped with headaches or migraines. I figured it couldn't hurt to try. I put the ball behind my neck and proceeded to read on, looking up headaches in the index. There are several pages that have suggestions for how to use the ball for this application. I found that after 15-20 minutes of following the instructions that the migraine was not gone but the pain was markedly less severe.I'm pleased that just out of the box that this book and therapy balls were able to be of some help. I'll update this review as I gain more experience with this set."
5,I'm addicted to these things,"My first trial run with the balls, to my surprise, I fell asleep on them for about 2 hours.They are absolutely wonderful. They are of great quality, very sturdy, and I'm thinking that they should last me quite a while.After several days of discovering their amazing versatility and uncovering sore muscles and trigger points I never knew I had,I almost think that I can write a book now that takes things further than that little book that comes with the balls.Your imagination and knowledge is your limit. Work slowly and breathe, just like the book says. Let your body weight and patience do the work.Best $12 bucks that I have spent in a very long time."
1,Quality has greatly declined,"I recently lost my ""miracle balls"" during a trip. They provided relief for a back condition for many years. But when I replaced them, I received flimsy, poor quality ones sporting a large ""Made in China"" label. They immediately took an egg-shape."
4,Great Technique,"Two small, cushy balls accompany a paperback exercise book that is meant to relieve pain, tone your body and improve posture. The manual begins with simple breathing exercises to help the individual relieve stress. Once the individual's breathing is regulated it is time to move on to the exercises, and the fun-part...the balls. The exercise techniques presented in this manual are simple and straight forward, however constructive. This is a system to help you relieve stress, tension and pain from head-to-toe. I would recommend The Miracle Ball Method."
5,great sound!,"From the first song, this is Armstrong at his best. The sound is crisp and clear and incredibly intricate. It's a treat!"
5,There is hope for the old shrinking church!,"If you are in an established church that continues to decline in attendance, this book will help you see you do not have to start over. Your church has the foundation, but needs to find the evangelism that once fueled the joy and celebration of a growing church. If you have been in a pastorate for 5-7 years and the trend is not good, hold steady, there is great hope! The book is full of real examples of small dieing churches that have turned it around, and practical advice on how you can lead your church toward spiritual/numerical growth."
4,"Rock, Reggae and Funk Sounds","The Times: Great new album by the lead guitarist from Toot's and the Maytals that was just awarded the grammy for the best reggae album of 2004. If you like the great guitar licks on True Love, you'll like this album too. I like the songs ""Ain't Gonna Be Your Fool"" and ""The Times"". Definately a great addition to anyone's music collection!"
4,Good product but poor instructions,"I love the clock. It looks and sounds good.The instructions that come with the clock are poor. It took longer than it should to set the options for the chimes. Once I figured it out by trial and error, it works as advertised. One other inconvenience is that the front of the clock does not open. You have to take it off the wall to set the time or other options."
5,Get the Yukon bug!,"This is a wonderfully warm, funny and honest account of the trials and tribulations experienced by a young English couple relocating to the fascinating wilderness of the Yukon. In spite of the sometimes unrelenting harshness of the climate and the obvious culture shock, this couple showed courage, endurance and an unswerving belief in their dream to live in the Yukon, and I love the way the author manages to retain his sense of humour even under the most difficult circumstances!This book has inspired me to learn all that I can about the Yukon and hope one day that I can make my dream a reality and move up there. Beautiful book - highly recommended."
1,If Only The Truth Were Nearer!,"The writing style is hard work, this can be excused by the Author's lack of writing experience. Dorian's skills as an Author will probably improve if he makes the mistake of carrying on this career. An experienced Editor could have done wonders to the book's idea. Cliches galore, from cover to cover. A lack of imagination. Huge chunks of the true feelings and experience of relocating (immigration?), living in Canada (the bugs, social scene and fitting in) and the adversity of this decision. Building a log cabin does not make us a Man and writing this book does not make Dorian an Author."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!!!,"American Lighthouses: A Comprehensive Guide was exactly what I was looking for. A way to find lighthouses during my travels. My AAA tour books and maps did not mark the lights and I found I had driven very close by some of the oldest and most beautiful lights in the country without even knowing it. Not again with this guild, divided up by states, I should not miss of the majestic old lighthouses."
5,"""A Great Bear Book""","This is a great book. There are wonderful rhymes. The drawings are detailed and fun; you can find faces on mountains and in water. There is a frog which hides on every page; looking for the frog and the different things makes this book even better.The book is fun and happy. It is a terrific bedtime story. Our copy is worn from use and love. This book should be as mandatory children's reading as ""Good Night Moon"" and ""Winnie the Pooh""."
5,One of the best children's books ever,"This is an outstanding book, and it's hard to believe that it hasn't been reprinted again. That's a real shame ($39.00!). It captured the imagination of our sons, and one of them said his first words reacting to this wonderfully imaginative story."
2,Boring!!!,"I teach Middle School French. I was excited to find a video on Chateaux. I was having my students do a project. The video is informative but very boring. I lost the kids very early into the video. I will continue to look for a video that is more ""Middle School friendly"""
2,wish these were cheaper...,"I have a need for these in my office for my credit card machine. I cannot figure out why HP makes all their darn ink products so darn expensive? These should be a couple of dollars yet they aren't. I guess cause you have to use them, you have to pay the price....Amazon's prices are fair for this, but HP should really be lowering their ink prices to keep their customers loyal!"
1,Poor,These cartridges only lasted four days. The same ones I have bought in the past last on average a month.
5,Mesmerizing and Haunting,"Most probably know Michael Nyman's movie music, and there is certainly nothing wrong with this collection from his movie scores, but he presents an even more interesting side with his other works such asNyman - Noises, Sounds & Sweet Air / Bott Summers Bostridge. His music mesmerizes me and I fell in love with his minimalist music years ago as a teenager in part because it was unlike anything I had ever heard before. There is a haunting, spiritual quality to it. Everytime I listen to it I fall in love with this amazing genius all over again. Sample his works on this CD and if you fall under the Nyman spell too, try some of his albums. While I enjoyed this collection of his movie music, I prefer the albums for the specific film productions, such as the PianoThe Pianoand GatticaGattaca: Original Motion Picture Soundtrackbecause the musical experience is more cohesive. The collection is good overview of his work."
5,The Judds,"I almost forgot how great the Judds harmonize. These are timeless songs that are even more relevant in these times than they were when they were new. Few in ""NEW COUNTRY"" music will ever be able to match these ladies in talent, style, or pure entertainment. Long live the music of the Judds!"
4,Judge the Judd's ...,"I have always liked the Judd's and own several of their CD's. In my opinion, this one ranks up there near the top of my Judd's list."
3,Disturbing story not well written,I saw a 'true crime' documentary on HLN about this case recently and bought the book for more information on the story. This book was very poorly written and was difficult for me to stay focused. I wish it had been written by someone else because it was a very sensational case that got very little national publicity due to other big cases at the time. A more gifted writer could have made a lot of money on a book about this case.
4,What's better then knowing the Killer personally?!,"This story is bizarre and what's truly scary is I know Dawn Godman. I was roommates with her, it was of course an unusual situation. I was in Jail, Not for anything serious of course. Anyhow I was aware of who she was and when they put me in her room I just almost died! She doesn't talk much or smile much. She always was playing cards with the other girls who were ""Lifer's"" and ""High Profile"" case Gals. I never dared ask her about what she had done, or why. I was so freaked out I asked to be transfered out of her room. Luckly I was home in 2 days. It was an experience I will never forget. I bought this book cause it is just too shocking to believe. Another strange coincidence is that if you readthe book you will see that Dawn Godman Used a wheelchair to roll into Kmart to buy the saw with Mrs. Steinman's Credit card. That wheelchair was bought from my Dad's work Bacon East Pharmacy."
5,Great Tie Hanger,"Simple, nice, and great quality. The cedar smell is not too strong and when the hanger is full, it still doesn't look stuffed or overly full."
4,Great for apartment use.,"Great way to organize a mess of ties. The frame is solid wood, heavy, and doesn't feel cheap at all. No horizontal clips to hold ties in place, but this is a very easy, inexpensive alternative to a mech tie rack."
5,Low Tech and Solid,"I got so tired of fussing with the cheap plastic electric tie racks. Changing batteries, run down motors. Blech. Here's a great smelling cedar tie holder that hangs nicely from a hook in my closet ceiling. Works great. No batteries. No plastic."
2,"Looks great, ties slide off","The smell and look of this is great. It fits pretty nicely hanging in the closet and obviously is very simple to use. The problem is that the second you touch the rack, all of the ties slip off of it. It's too bad, as it is a great product otherwise...but since you can't exactly not touch a tie rack to get the ties off of it, it doesn't work well."
3,good quality but bulky,"The fit and finish of this product are very good. Unfortunately, it takes up a lot of space in the closet so it was not quite what I had hoped."
1,Astro Nut,Wow. The planets determine stock and futures prices. What a nut bag. The beauty of this approach is that it can never be disproved. It's like me saying that there are chocolate cakes orbiting Jupiter. Now it's up to you to prove that I am wrong. If you believe in astrology then make sure you take a flying leap into bed every night because there is a monster ready to grab you toes hiding under your bed. Start by reading The New Market Wizards and The Ultimate Trading Guide - both great books. PS. The tooth fairy is dead and so isn't using astrology to predict anything.
3,Nice Looking,This was a nice looking coat. It came with a hole in the pocket but its outward appearance wasn't effected by that issue. There was only 1 issue that is of concern. It has no way to close the coat except with the belt. It needed a button or something else that fastened it so it would not slide apart when wearing it.
1,I want my time back,"Anyone who thinks this book is ideal for a beginning student better think again. My school inflicted this book upon my class and I and it caused most of the class to give up on Java for VB! Maybe this book is good for people who are intermediate or advanced. I wasted months pouring over this book when I could have bought Just Java or some other beginner book and gotten it right away.I don't think this book will make a good reference later either as there are no clear, simple exampes in it for later use. So all in all this book did nothing for me but waste my time."
5,Excellent intro book for learning Java,"If you just start to learn Java, this is one of the best books you can find. It provides many detailed examples on all the basic stuff you need to know in Java, especially for beginners. Although some people think it's wordy, the explanation is comprehensive. I don't know whether this book is good for studying for certication exam, but I'm sure you can learn Java using this book. Some other books may help you study for the exam, but this book is one that really teach you ""how to write real Java programs.""It's also great to use as a course textbook for students with no background in java or programming. Highly recommended."
3,Dissatisfied,"The wrong item was shipped and while the company credited my account quickly, I was not reimbursed for the return postage (Why did I have to pay? It was their mistake!) So, I'm out money and still don't have the album I wanted."
2,Hard To Finish,This book Was verry hard to get into. The author spent to much time reviewing caricters to get into the story and capter your attention. I love to read but this book was so boring I barly got threw it. To me it was A waste of my money.
3,VERY PRETTY BUT NOT A SCREENSAVER.,"This product comes up under ""screensaver"" but it seems to only work on a TV screen, not a computer so it was disappointing."
5,Great for Stress!,"I have been taking this supplement for almost 3 years now and I love it. I work an office job and tend to carry a lot of my tension in my neck and shoulders, which then leads to headaches. When I first began taking this I could actually feel my muscles relax a bit. Now - if I run out I find my muscles tightening up again. It really helps me stay a bit more stress and headache free!"
3,A wel written book for those working with challenging children,"Jan Kristal's book, The Temperament Perspective, is a well written book dealing with the concept of temperament. It may be more geared to professionals who work with the challenging child than the parent, but I wouldn't say that parents shouldn't read it.She does a nice job of going through the different traits of temperament, who they are represented in different behaviors, and what can be triggers for tantrums if the trait is stressed. She talks about the tools to determine a child's temperament profile and how to work with the traits that are experiencing stress (both for the child and the adult). She also makes good use of vignettes to provide an example of temperament related problems for children.This has been a good addition to the books out to help adults understand both their own profile and the profiles of children who are struggling."
5,classic,it was a nice gift for my sister at her baby shower...she'll be able to play it once my nieces are born
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed--it is undoubtedly scholarly, after all it is Alastair Duncan, but I wanted it for the visuals. The book itself is only 6""x8"". Of the 194 illustrations, most are very small black and white photos. Details are lost. (Only 44 are in color.) It seems good enough if you want it for historical reference, but not if you are looking for design resources. I regret buying it."
5,great gift idea,this is so cool. the book ends are GEORGOUS. ive actually seen just the bookends going on Ebay for over 100$
3,"Smells great, but the atomizer shown in the product picture does not come with the purchase.","My wife likes this perfume, and I like it on her. I purchased it for her birthday, and the product picture shows an atomizer attached to it. I purchased this specific SKU because my wife had mentioned that she wanted an atomizer. Unfortunately it was delivered without one included."
2,Label is incorrect,For some reason the label is on the opposite side from the picture which put the contacts the opposite side from the picture. The battery must be inserted just the opposite for correct operation oin the camera and charger. I noticed the difference and put some VERY visible marks on the correct side so that the contacts will be oriented correctly.
2,Technical Errors,"There are so many books 'how-to' books out there on mosaic technique. Some are accurate, clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience, and some have very misleading and incorrect information. I'm afraid this book falls in the former category. When an author mentions using Elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate, then I would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book.For a proven 'how-to' book on creating mosaics, I would suggest 'Mosaic Techinques and Traditions' by Sonia King or any of the books by Emma Biggs, Tessa Hunkin, or Elaine Goodwin. These are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form."
5,Great grit,This is the same grit that came with their branded tumbler. Works great. I will purchase this again when we run out.
1,CHECK WITH YOUR VET FIRST!,"Purchased hoping this would help our GSD's separation anxiety. Worked really well the first day for about 5+ hours, so we were quite encouraged by it. Then spoke to our vet who was concerned about the Impatiens ingredient...apparently a daily dose for 3 mos. can cause liver damage. We will not be using this any more...please check with your vet before buying - giving 1 star because it did calm him down, but no more because of the health concerns tied to it."
3,Worth a read,"It's difficult to say if this is a novelisation on the movie or was written beforehand, the copy I have doesn't say. However it closely follows the movie in terms of plot and detail -- with much extra material and expanded explanations.The style differs much from movie, it's tone begins as more as an action or adventure novel and Schanberg is presented as a more macho character. However, a reader familiar with the literature detailing this period will note that the scenes are stunningly vivid and accurate. Christopher Hudson obviously spent time in Phnom Penh before the fall or exhaustively researched it.Overall, a nice compliment to the movie and well worth a read for those interested in this period of history."
4,Entertaining Short Stories.,"This collection includes some entertaining short stories.The Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge stands head and shoulders above the rest, as a literary masterpiece.The other stories vary in quality. Some are better than others.But all of them reflect Ambrose Bierce' extremely negative views of war as a pointless, senseless struggle. Many of the stories strike one as rather ""sick"" by the strange grotesque plot that ends in senseless death. Truly, it would take someone rather disturbed by the horror of war to think them up.These stories are mostly an entertaining bunch, if you can handle the strange nature of them. The book is worth the price just to read ""An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge""."
4,"Not worth it. These stories are good, but there are too few of them.","CIVIL WAR STORIES, by Ambrose Bierce. Not worth it. Just buy the complete works of Ambrose Bierce and all of these stories will be included in it."
4,It takes you back to a bygone era,"What is remarkable in itself is a firsthand account of a famous American War, The Civil War, written by a legendary author. It is an old world, almost archaic, style of writing that was difficult for me to read, and to understand the underlying stories. At least one of Ambrose Bierce's classic writings, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek"", was produced into a truly amazing Twilight Zone episode. I personally didn't enjoy the book that much, and I don't naturally gravitate to these subject matter type of books, but I bent old attitudes and habits of thinking by reading a page or two a day. I'm glad I bought it and read it."
5,A Soldier's View of the Civil War,"Ambrose Bierce served during the American Civil War, serving as a cartographer and officer for the Union. In these 16 compelling tales, Bierce conveys the sights and sounds from a soldier's perspective of the war, ranging from being in the heart of battle in ""What I Saw of Shiloh"" to a young boy lost in the woods in ""Chickamauga"" to tales of the supernatural and of odd events, including ""One of the Missing"" -- a chilling tale of a soldier in an abandoned house -- and his famous ""An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge."" Bierce's no-nonsense style puts the reader in the heart of the action, making the reader take an active part in the events. A great collection of stories from one of America's best writers."
4,HISTORY IN THE 1ST PERSON........,"Bierce writes with the eye of a skeptic and beyond the hurahhs and romantic vision of war. Given his later life the war apparently made an immpression on him which lasted till death.The carnage, vile bloddy scenes, the death never left him and it was obvious in his writings and life. Good book to see the unvarnished truth!!"
4,Good to know information,"This book have much information about the older Schwinn bicycles. I have read elsewhere that there are many books that claim to have exact information about bikes. So, I don't know if everything in this is accurate but it does seem like there is a great deal of good information in here. Some of the stuff is remembered so we know that it is accurate on that. I don't know that any one source can have all information as so many things changed from time to time in a factory that unless you had someone there at the time it would be very hard to verifiy what was fact or fiction."
2,Classic Schwinn Bicycles,I bought the book not realizing that the author does not consider the Varsity and Continental to be classic Schwinns .Very little about the bikes in the book.
5,Nice beats and Lyrics,"Pretty good beats and the lyrics are point on for anyone that's a Christian. It actually funny to me because I don't listen to hip-hop or rap, because of the stereotype of being pretty negative most of the time, but not thus, it's clean, nothing to offend you, or anything of that nature. I want my buddies to hear it to, since it has a good beat and it does actually preach to a person about the type of woman a Christian man should look for. Praise God for not condemning the style of music, but just the heart and intentions of it."
5,Music to the Ears,"I love chimes and the Music of the Spheres chimes are the best I have ever purchased. The chimes are beautifully tuned and the sound resounds for quite a long time. This Gypsy Chime is light, airy and playfull a great addition to any bass chimes you might already have."
5,Truly Beautiful,"I had high hopes for these chimes before they arrived... My expectations were exceeded! Very well made. The variety of scale/tune with these windchimes can't be beat. The sound is so ""true"". It was almost distracting in its prettiness at first. I also enjoy that it plays a small random tune so it never gets old. I just love it. It's worth the price - no really, buy one."
5,wow,"This book is much more than I expected. I purchased it because of my interest in football, Dynamo Kiev, and because of my german-russian background. I expected a book about soccer and it was much more. It opened my eyes to the facts surrounding the occupation of Kiev and the Russian perspective of the war. The story draws you in and it is hard to put the book down. It is also very personal for somebody with ties to the Kiev area and people.If you are interested in these subjects, you should read this book. You will not be disappointed."
5,Great Game!! Highly recommended for anybody who likes games!,"This game is one of the best games for PS. Sagat is my favorite character because his combos are outrageous and he is scary.(Look at his face). Ken is also another good character, but the whole game takes hours to beat and doesn't get boring because there is a lot to do. For some, the fighting might get repetitive but try different characters and experiment you'll be SURPRISED what can be done.... A great game for a great price!"
5,The Best Street Fighter Available,"If you are a Street Fighter die hard fan, then this game must be in your collection. As a SFII fan myself, I rate this the best compared to even the Playstation 2 versions. It is simply the most playable and the most fun incarnation of the game. Do yourself a favor and get this one. You won't regret it."
4,Capcom's Grand Opus... you decide,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 - Circa 1999GOOD:- Good Balanced 2D fighter, considered a classic to many hardcore 2D fighting fans- Lots of modes to unlock and lots of fighters to choose fromBAD:- Loading times, very short but still there- Graphics might be dated for some peopleWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Not over the top like Guilty Gear X/X2, Marvel Vs Capcom, or Capcom Vs SNK- Old School type game play and not combo heavyGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- King of fighters 2000 and up- Fatal Fury: Mark of WolvesADDITIONAL NOTES:- Last game in the Street Fighter ""Alpha"" franchise (as of 1999)- Has all fighters from Street Fighters Alpha 1 and 2 as well as a few from the old time Street Fighter's like Street Fighter II: The world Tour- Street Fighter Alpha is called Street Fighter Zero in Japan- Practicality same game on Sega Dreamcast"
2,Good for a week,"I bought this battery wanting a cheap replacement. I'm now shopping for a better quality battery, as this one fails to hold a charge after sitting for any length of time i.e. a day. It works immediately after charging, but forget about being able to spontaneously pick your camera up to take a picture; if its been several hours or a couple of days the charge might be gone."
1,Pictures are deceiving...,This shower head is huge. I had to return it since I wanted a shower head that i would be able to easily handle.
3,waterpik shower nozzle,Works ok but package advertised 12 settings. I only found 5. No details on owners manual. Installs easy.
3,Wrong covers,"The same model NVL-660C appeared to have two packaging: one cover says that it has 10 setting as the web site says, and another type says that it has ""6 Power Spray"" setting. I received one which said 6 setting. It confused me how they don't match between the product and their web site specification. I went to Home Depot and did found that there are two conflicting covers. I have not tried it yet but the confusing packaging itself for a given model gave me some concern how good a quality that they will deliver."
5,OKIDATA Toner Cartridge,This item is not stocked by local office supply stores and is quite expensive at some on-line sources. I was very happy to find it at a very fair price at Amazon. Thanks!
4,My 2 cents,"The price is too high and the discs too short. It really does lack the magic of the original mainly due to the lack of Harry Smith's original notes and overall design. What it does have is a brilliant biography of Smith who was an all around oddball and flake (he refused to release this originally because the label wanted to include a pro FDR song!). However he came about compiling this list from his enormous collection (shortly before he sold it the New York Public Library), the result is a brilliant mix of obscure and known tracks from the depression.So, if you liked the original, you know you are going to buy this someday (where else can one find such an appreication for jug band music?). If you are a fan of ""Race and Hillbilly"" like me you'll give blood to get this."
3,Missing the Point,"While the characters in the book are vivid and exciting, the story is lost in an attempt to say something that never quite makes it through. I like the style, and did enjoy reading it, but I kept waiting for the resolutions, the point, and ended the book with out seeing a clear conclusion. I am looking forward to reading her other works, as this one as a first effort shows alot of promise."
5,Collectors Must Have Book,I found this book to be just what I was looking for in a Reference/History book. Bruce Canfield must have had the average military collector in mind when he wrote this work. He has updated the original text and the clarity of the pictures is excellent. It has helped answer some of the questions that I had about my M1 Garand. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR COLLECTORS.
4,Guide book,"Although I am not finished reading this book, I am very pleased with the content so far. This book goes into very good detail with good quality pictures. I was looking for a book to assist me in the purchase of an M1, and I feel more comfortable in my quest now that I am much more educated on the specifics of differant models and details purtaining to certain years and serial numbers as pointed out in this book. The content may be a little to detail oriented for the reader that is just trying to gain the history of this weapon, but for the reader looking to learn the ""nuts and bolts"" of this gun, I would highly recommend this guide."
5,Another good book.,A good source of information on both the M1 rifle and M1 carbine. Use it with other books for reference or just by itself to read about both of those weapons.
4,The Early Slavs: a wealth of hard-to-get information,"This is a scholarly book by an archaeologist/historian living in Poland. 12 main maps, plus some more maps among the 72 illustrations, most of which are clear line drawings, not photos. The most important characteristic of this book is that it summarizes in English a wealth of information otherwise available only in Slavic languages. (Most of the 38 pages of notes and references cite Slavic language sources.) A very enlightening examination of who the Slavs are and where they might have come from. Of limited use in genealogy, since the main story here ends in about the 11th Century. Tiny print is hard on the eyes."
3,"The capsules are great, unfortunately they sent me the wrong size","These are too large for my capsule filler. They seem to be size 00. Other than that, they are of good quality, and they were a good price. Bad side, unless I get a different size filler, I have to load these by hand."
3,Wish I got the item ordered,"When I was ordering gel caps I asked for the double ""O"" caps and recieved single, not real happy about the change up as now I must reorder original needed caps."
4,Empty Gelatin Calsules,"This is a good, useful product for packaging powder supplements that have not given me no problems that I look forward to using"
4,post-holocaust tale four survivors witness the end of time,"The first novella which is a post-holocaust tale in which four survivors witness the end of time. -- (John Clute / Encyclopedia of Science Fiction)Includes 'Up and Out' and 'The Mountains of the Moon'.Powys says, ""Underlying both these stories, is that there is nothing in the universe devoid of some mysterious element of consciousness, however small, queer, ridiculous, or whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, such a thing may be."""
3,"Charlie, just before his leap of faith into charanga","Originally released by Gone Records(""Long gone ago"")in April 1959, this nice (All instrumental and danceable) recording, was Charlie Palmieri's last before creating what was most probably the first musical group dedicated to play exclusively the musical craze ""Charanga"". Here, among the recording quartet, we find playing the conga and bongos, a young up and coming dominican fellow called Johnny Pacheco, who earlier had already recorded as a gifted flautist with the genious Tito Puente. Right after this release, Charlie Palmieri and Johnny Pacheco teamed up to form the band called ""La Duboney"", which recorded various LP's into the mid 1960's."
4,Gotta love Elmo!,"I bought this book to keep our 18-month-old busy during a roadtrip. She LOVES Elmo and was not disappointed by this book. The story is very simple, and the illustrations are very bright and engaging. The only down-side is that the pop-up of Elmo at the end of the book tears pretty easily. I would recommend this book for toddlers and preschoolers. Keep in mind, though that you may want to keep an eye on your little one when reading it so the book doesn't get ruined."
5,One of my sons favorites!,This is one of my sons favorite books! Every night we read it a FEW times... he goes through and does everything that baby elmo does even before I finish reading the page! It's a very cute book!
5,Love it!,"My 10 month old daughter absolutely loves this book. We purchased it after going to the Sesame Street exhibit at the Children's Museum, and she has looked at it over and over every day since. She loves to hear the story, but she will also sit and look at each page over and over on her own. She loves it so much, I am afraid I may have to buy a second copy just in case the pop-up on the last page rips."
5,This Book is So Good!,"My son loved this book. I loved reading him this book! Sadly he's outgrown it but we had so much fun with this one. He would howl in delight, more with everypage, through to the climactic finish.I highly recommend this and the other Sesame Street books. This is the gift I now buy for the young readers."
1,Sent me broken book,"I bought this book for my daughter. I was not very smart and wrapped it before looking through the book. Then on Christmas my daughter opened the book and the last page is ripped missing the big Elmo. I'm very upset with Amazon over this. I can't return the book now because past the 30 day mark. I have been a big fan of Amazon, but I feel they are getting worst with all the new policies."
1,Pretty stupid book,"I know this is a book for babies - but it is one of the stupidest books I've had to read to my kids. There are much better written, more interesting books that are engaging for both small children and their parents.Skip this book."
5,great book or babies!,I first discovered this book while I was a nanny for a one year old boy. He absolutely loved it and learned a lot of moving and words from having this book read to him many times. I just bought it for my 5 month old and she already loves it! Its a great book for boys and girls and is colorful and entertaining!
3,Catch the Wind - We Five,"I was very excited when I learned that this album was now available. After listening to it 1-3 times, I liked it, but was somewhat dissapointed. I was expecting more of the original We Five sound. Their version of Milk Cow Blues is really not that good. Where is Bev Bivens when you need her. I'm glad that this rounds out my We Five coleection, but again a bit dissapointed with the album."
3,El Sistema--children's music,"I saw the earlier inspiring and thrilling video Tocar y Luchar, and read a review that the more recent El Sistema was even better. But I found El Sistema focused much more on the social problems in Venezuela and never demonstrated the great musicality and excitement of the program that the earlier disc did."
3,From texas (also),"um...best of luck to the band. I recieved a cd personally from the girlfriend of one of the members of the band a few years back (hi Lisa). I would have to say that, its a good album, but it could be soo much more. most of the song sounded pretty much the same. most...not all. And I personally don't like the simple ryming. Perhaps the follow up album will be better. I see a skinny puppy/front line assembly/old marilyn manson/collide sound sometime in the future. i say go for it, buy it, its worth having. its worth listening to. its not a bad cd, like I said. But don't expect too much. at least not right now. :)<<<<mail me>>>> g1bb0ns@hotmail.com"
4,Still Hunting with God,"Steve Chapman follows up his ""A Look at LIfe from a Deer Stand"" with a fine pocket devotional that can be a part of every person's hunting experience. Each one can be read in several minutes and provide hours of meditative fodder for the quiet, still hours one often spends on a Deer Stand. I recommend it. Great gift for fellow hunters, too. Not preachy. Very practical."
2,Hard to put together well,Side pieces were not even and we could not put it together. Had to cut them to size. Poor quality.
3,Frustration!,"After receiving the incorrect product, the company quickly responded and overnighted the product I ordered no additional charge. Found out that the upright posts along with the top rail and bottom rail were supposed to be the same length and they were off by up to 2"" so a little cutting was needed. Not a big deal. But as simple of a product this is to manufacture this should not have happened. The netting is not as thick and sturdy looking as in the picture I saw. I still rate the product 3 stars because my son really enjoys it."
2,"Mylec deluxe ultra pro II hockey goal, White",This was just what I wanted for my grandson for Christmas. Took about five minutes to assemble as stated. He really loved it - Only took about two days to crack in cold weather (mid 30's) Thought it was supposed to be okay in cold. Would not buy again....
4,Thought Provoking,"I bought this book for my husband, who incidentally is an aspie. He says that this book is small, shor, eary to read but has some pretty deeper information that requires some real thought on all the matters. Seems that since he has started reading it we have been having more discussions concerning inner anger that is pent up. This has opened some communication for us, which is always a great thing! He does keep saying that it is a little hippie-ish, meaning I guess that it is a little spiritual for his taste as he leans toward atheism. All in all this book is opening communication and thats what counts for me. Good luck to you all."
4,Anger Management,"The book is excellent for someone with an anger management issue. For someone who wants to manage stress/anger, I'd recommend the book ""Heart Math"" which is more resourceful."
1,Stop stop stop!,"I've been looking for books to help with the toxic anger that is killing me, but when I got to the word ""Heartmath"" I became so suffused with rage that I knocked my computer monitor off of the desk, punched my wall until my kunckles were bloody, then kicked my garbage can halfway down the hall. My coworker asked me what was wrong and I screamed at her to leave me alone until she was in tears. Stop stop stop stop peddling bizarre portmanteau word salad hokum, please - people like me are trying to live."
1,Flea market special,"When you spend $50 on a small leather folder, you expect it to at least have ""genuine leather"" stamped or embossed or on a tag or insert SOMEWHERE! This has no manufacturer or brand name or tag whatsoever. There is no way for the gift recipient to tell that you didn't pick this up at a flea market for $5!!"
1,Incomprehensible,"This book is not history OR journalism. It is more the ramblings of a fanatic. Jacobs skips time, place, themes, without any connection or point of reference. He jumps right into the famine without examining the political or economic conditions that caused it. There is no attempt to make this a book about Biafra--the whole work is a polemic denouncing the UK and the US and the ICRC. Truly a wretched work.It reads more like the mumblings of a drug addled sociology professor than a work worthy of publication."
3,Like a Good Merlot,"Like a good Merlot, this book is thorough and educational in it's information but very dry. American Higher Education covers most of the current challenges and issues in higher education today. However, it can be difficult to read a chapter in one sitting. There is little to spark the reader's interest at times. The charts and graphs are helpful, but could use a little extra information to guide the reader to best understand what the author hopes to present.If you are looking to learn about American Higher Education in the 21st Century: Social, Political, and Economic Challenges, this is exactly the book you need. Just anticipate and plan for reading time accordingly."
4,Book for Iss 210,"The only problem I had was the book took a while to get here. Otherwise good condition. Only problem also was that my teacher isn't even having us use them, what a waste!"
3,Amusing but cheesy,"Thought this was amusing, and still do -- but the quality was terrible, so not worth buying for anything but a joke..."
3,More for what it says than quality,"The quality is very ""flimsy"" - if you order it consider that you're getting it for the fun of it, not for it's functionality. Im pretty sure this would be an interior mat, not exterior."
3,Fading,"Bought this jokingly as recommended by a co-worker for use in my cubicle. Always gets a good laugh/comment from people seeing it for the first time. As described in other reviews, the black text and border are just printed on cheaply, and the letters are already fading to gray with light usage (just me walking in and out of my cube)."
4,Nice Mat,This is a very nice Mat. I had one and I bought this one for a friend who's name is Matt. He loved it.
4,I'm Thrilled!,I think this mat is super clever and I'm so excited to have it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't totally versatile as it doesn't seem rugged enough to withstand the outdoors... it's a thin carpet. Other than that? It's terrific and I've already got some chuckles from visitors about it.
5,Awesome Mat,"I had been hunting around for a ""different"" welcome mat for my new apartment, and when I saw this one, I knew it was perfect. It's probably a little small as far as welcome mats go, but it's not really a problem, and the quality is fine. Always a good conversation piece for people who've never seen it before - a great purchase in my opinion."
5,Great product!,"My girlfriend and I both think the ""I'm a mat""(mat) is hilarious. Should be interesting when people wipe their feet now."
2,Fun but thin and disappointing,"Length:: 1:10 MinsMy review of the ""Hi. I'm Mat"" doormat. It looked great on the website but when I got it I thought it was small and thin, and not worth the price I paid. I may return it."
2,functional but fading,"bought this here on amazon around a month ago.the fabric is quality, and functionally, there is nothing wrong with this mat.but the text (""HI. I'M MAT"") has already started to fade dramatically. it is still visible, but will probably be completely faded in a month or so.we don't give it an insane amount of traffic. it is by our back door, so it is used maybe 2-3 times a day to let our dogs out.expect the text to fade."
2,Use caution on hardwood floors.,"The mat does not grip hardwood floors, making it a slip hazard. A non-slip backing is necessary to make this product safe to use."
2,Student Solutions,"The info contained in the chapters is pretty good and I appreciated the examples of how to do the work, however...if you're a student and you want to check your homework, that might be a little hard. The author only lists SOME of the answers to the homework, and the answers they do have usually don't tell you how they arrived at those answers. What they NEED to provide is a student solutions manual. I'd be happy to pay extra for it, but they don't have it. They do sell a student study guide, which I did purchase and that does help some, but it's not even close to what would allow the student to understand the homework problems in a step by step manner. Would someone at the publishing house PLEASE provide a student solutions manual??? PLEEEEASE!!!!!!!!"
1,Gift basket contained expired products!,I ordered this as a gift of course. A number of the food items had expired dates! Needless to say I am very embarrassed.... and disapointed.
2,Arm holes way too big,"I thought this would be the perfect camisole for me, but when it came the arm holes were way too big. The advertised picture does not show that to be the case. I had a $7.00 return and restocking fee to pay. Very disappointed."
3,Kind of Funny,There are a few gems buried in here. But is it worth buying the whole book to get to them? I don't know. These diary/journal entries will take you back to the not so distant past and I could have written some of them myself!
1,"Tasteless, Wasteful Text on pages","I'd been craving a good book to read and thought this would be interesting. I wasted my money big time. I didn't laugh once and I find almost each and every one of the people telling their storied simply repulsive. And they're all the same thing! I tried to like it but at this point (and I've tried to read it twice) I actively want to burn this book. To sum up, I'm disappointed."
4,Voyuer,"This peek into the young lives of our peers, parents, bosses and complete strangers hits closer to home than we might like. These real life stories told in the young voices that wrote them as they happened, make for an irresistible read. Stories of young love lost or never realized. Histories of drug abuse. Relatable anecdotes of self consious body image make up the bulk of these tales (oh yeah and a kids fixation on Mr. Belvedere).The only draw back I felt was the lack of sectional separation (IE. love, sex, drugs.....) which could have made it a better re-read of certain entries. I have yet to see the live show, but look forward to going if I get near one."
2,"Mundane, Repetitive, No Variety","I sat and read this book in an evening. Practically all of the entries were from people that were of a certain cultural background (Jewish) and from a certain area (Massachusetts). It would have been nice if there would have been more varied situations, i.e. students from large vs. small high schools, racial backgrounds, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds. Great concept, but it falls short. Also, a lot of the entries were really similar... there's got to be more teenage craziness out there."
3,"A book you borrow from the library, not a keeper.","I read the book while I was having my brakes fixed. A few of the diary entries were interesting and I wanted to read more. However, the bulk of the material was very short anecdotes (two or three pages) of teen angst and unrequited love and they were all too similar. Most of the entries were very short and as one reviewer aptly stared, they bleed together. This must be how a high-school English teacher feels after reading a hundred essays on, ""What I did this summer.""This is the kind of book that is an interesting way to kill time, but not the kind of book you will lend to friends and family. I strongly suggest borrowing it from a library instead of buying it."
3,I hope...fast shipping,I know procrastination was a factor in my lack of timely ordering. I hope this ships quickly as other reviewers stated on their reviews.
2,"They say it is in stock, not so","Today I get this email from ANTOnlineWe are so sorry to inform you, stock has not arrived as planned for your purchase in our warehouse setup to ship to your location. We are expecting a re-supply truck to arrive with more stock in 5-7 business days. We will ship your order then if you can accept this small delay.Please reply to this email letting us know that it is OK to ship when the stock arrives.Thanks for your order and understanding this small delay.The Support Team at ANTOnlineThe website seed that the item was in stock so i ordered it to replace a power supply in my server. I expected it to ship today! There now emailing me saying that it is not in stock."
3,I just want to sleep!!,"I got this because my hyperactive kitten chases my other cat around my studio apartment ALL NIGHT, knocking stuff over, running over me & scaring me to death, and just generally making a ruckus. The first night, it knocked him out cold and I slept peacefully for the first time in months, but then it seemed not to work as well. I put it in their water, but they got wise to it & stopped drinking it at night (!! brilliant little devils!!) so I think you really have to find a way to just shoot it right into their mouths! I figured if I could get them to sleep through the night for a couple of weeks they might just adapt & I wouldn't have to turn my cats into little druggies, but it's not looking good."
2,Not a good option for us.,"As noted in another recent review, this comes in a different bottle than what is shown on the product page. It's the same company, but the stuff is labeled 'Calm Down' and it comes in an 8-ounce bottle, not 9.6 oz. as advertised.At least one of our cats did not like the smell (I'm guessing the 13% alcohol may have bothered him). He'd go to the dish and splash water out with his paw, as though he was trying to dig the bad-smelling stuff away to get to the good water underneath. It made kind of a mess. we didn't use it long enough to really assess the mood/behavior effects on the other cats."
2,Calm for kitty.,"I was very disappointed in this product. Upon reading the label - it has alcohol in it. No wonder it calms the kitty. I have not opened this, nor do I intend to give to my cats."
3,Metric screw thread identifier,"I was disappointed that the threads were rough and had plastic tailings still in the threads. I then remembered a machinist telling me 40 years ago how difficult working with Teflon and plastics were, so I guess this is the norm. It is usable but not what I thought I was getting."
1,A great idea but all plastic construction is a bad idea,"I liked everything about this...right up until it was delivered. FYI, it's made completely of plastic. When I unwrapped it, I thought that plastic threads and metal threads would be a bad combination. Still, I was cautiously pessimistic, and tried it anyways. Unfortunately, the second screw I tried to identify the thread pitch on, stripped the flimsy plastic threads on the identifier. Seems the metal threads on the screw had cut the plastic threads on the Identifier (and much too easily in my opinion).I know now that I should never have bought it, as it was entirely foreseeable and a reasonable assumption that the plastic threads would strip easily when cut with metal screw threads. I give it 1 star for a cool idea, and take off 4 stars for...what the heck were they thinking making it out of plastic? I suggest that this has a market if it were made out of steel. As a tool, it fails in it's current configuration."
3,INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is great(of course not as much as Ricky!). It told me all I wanted to know about him. I know is great, but by reading this book made him my favorite celebrety ever!!!!!!!!!! It's all about his life and youth in different careers. I only gave three stars because there weren't many pictures. They were all black and white. And there was mostly long hair, but if I needed to I'd buy this book again!!!!!!!!!!"
2,DISSAPOINTED,"I ordered this book on-line, but unfortunately the description was misleading, since all the pictures were black and white."
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK,"If you love Ricky Martin as much as I do, then you have to buy this book! Ricky is sexy, sexy, sexy and there are lots of sizzling pictures of him. I read it one day!"
4,Bad Boys Ahoy,"Bad Boys Ahoy was fascinating.Three stories in one book.All related to great adventure,friendship and love and desire.I would recommend this book to readers interested in that."
2,Poor,I didn't enjoy this book. i thought it was poorly written and very corny. I wasn't interested enough to finish reading the whole book.
5,"A women of action, a women who made her dreams come true.","Marion Hollins is by far one of the most accomplished persons in American history. Her story is motivating and incredible. For anyone who doubts their ability to succeed, this is a must read."
4,"Terrific life story of this ""can do"" woman athlete.","Marion Hollins' life story is an amazing series of accomplishments, crowned by her design work at Cypress Point and Pasatiempo Golf Clubs. This is a 'must read' for Central Coast people who want to learn more about how Marion's dedication and determination influenced the formation of Pebble Beach and Pasatiempo during the '20s and '30s. Her tragic ending at an early age leaves the reader wondering what more she could have accomplished had she lived a bit longer."
5,Fantastic,"The First King of All Israel. A great personality. A Great King. A Great Warrior.Mr. Sanford has done a magnificent job at recreating an amazing personality.King Saul, one of the most important figures of humanity, comes to life in avery vivid, down to earth style. Lavishly well written, Mr. sanford brings to lifea psychohistorical analysis of a great historical figure. magnificently well written,well researched, excellently exposed."
2,Nothing special,"I don't know how these other reviewers find this to be 5-star material. It's okay, but basically it's background music with no melodic or any other kind of musical hooks. It's all electronic, and sounds like someone did this on their home computer. Granted, a lot of music is done today on home computers, but this *sounds* like it...it has a rather amateurish feel to it. If you're in the mood for something instrumental, entirely electronic, and background in nature, this is fine, but I have to sharply disagree with the reviewers who rate it tops."
4,"Slightly overrated, but still a Classic...","I have to be honest. I bought The Buck Special just because I always wanted to have one...not because I planned on needing it or using it often. My personal 119 came with a few minor problems though...some small scratches on the blade and unsightly stains around what seems to be a filled lanyard hole....if it wasn't designed to have a hole, why am I seeing traces of one?In short...it's a beautiful, nostalgic piece of Knife History, and it comes in a very nice leather sheath (with a hard insert)...it's light and comfortable in the hand, and you can get it for the best price here at Amazon.Regards,SKULLSPLITTER - The CEO"
4,great knife,Great for utility purposes while camping and even better for keeping them hippies from singing in the next camp site over! :)
2,Large Butter Knife,"Knife arrived dull, with an uneven edge. I'll never buy a another premium grade knife without be able to physically check the edge. I wanted a large ""sharp"" hunting knife for the upcoming moose season, and what I got was a very attactive dull knife that I can't get to take an edge. I thought I was safe buying from Buck, but I guess quality is a thing of the past."
1,they dont make em like they used to,"Ive owned 4 buck 119s throughout my life, the one I had from the 70s was my favorite fixed blade knife of all time but it had been sharpened to the point where the blade was worn down quite a bit. I purchased my 2nd 119 and it swiftly broke while limbing trees on my farm. The next one the point broke off while putting a divot in a 4 by 4, the one after that had a shoddy handle that broke in half when I tried to nail a grouse with it and I hit a rock. After all these fails I got a gi tanto and its exactly what ive been looking for only twice as durable and half the price. Sorry buck, I wish I could go back in time and stockpile a bunch of quality era 119s but you really dissapointed me with the new materials."
4,Good knife,"Great knife as all Bucks are. I thought that I was ordering the Buck Special, which is the 7 1/2 inch blade but when it arrived it was a 6 inch blade. Still a great knife and very sharp and stays sharp. Just make sure to read and research better than I did."
5,Buck 0119BKS-B Special Fixed Blade Knife,"Excellent hunting knife! After searching out hunting knives and reading many reviews, this knife was a good choice. They also have a lifetime warranty. My son was very happy to receive this."
5,Outstanding knife...,"I have had this particular Buck knife for...going on about 15 years now. It has never failed me, has withstood more abuse than I can recollect and, through it all, has scarcely a blemish and an edge that is still sharp enough with which to shave. I have many other knives, K-Bars from my USMC days, Gerbers, Pumas, Case, other Bucks...and all are awesome, but this one is very near and dear to me for all it has been through and all it continues to deliver.Do yourself a service and pick one of these up. There is simply no better knife for the money. This is one you will hand down to your grandson."
5,It's a buck,Awesome sheath. Solid construction. Factory sharp. Love it. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality knife. It'll last a lifetime.
4,Almost as good as rhe original,"I ordered this knife after seeing one a friend has since the 197-'s. The newer one is lighter, the blade is not as thick and the handle is hollow. The original or earlier version has a heavier handle and feels sturdier. Never the less, still a good buy and useful tool."
5,Great knife,Hi there I recieved this knife today and I really like this knife im not used to a light weight knife but I will get used to it the buck119 I have wanted one for a long time and I am gladd I got it this seller is good did not have to waite 5 days and it was easy to track all and all I will buy from this seller again
4,buck 119 special fixed blade knife,"so right out of the box this knife comes extremely sharp and shiny. even after some rough field dressing the edge still holds and is fairly easy to sharpen and re-sharpen. the grip on the knife is smooth but you will still have a firm hold on it if your hands are covered in a slippery substance such as blood, water, urine( you never know) oils from animal fat, so the handle is ok. this knife in particular is a very pretty knife out of the box but after some use, it may look pretty rough. One of the very best things I like about it is that it is MADE IN THE U.S.A! the only real con about the buck 119 that I found is that the blade will rust fairly easily. for my uses this is a problem and is also why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars."
5,Quality knife,The Buck 119 is a quality knife that will last you a lifetime. It is also made in the United States.
5,He is going to love it!,"Received this item yesterday! I'm extremely pleased. I've read that some have stated they got it cheaper at walmart, however I reviewed the item they sell there and the sheath they are selling it with is not NEAR as nice as the one I received with this order. It was worth the extra $1.50 to buy it here. My husband is going to absolutely love this knife. I can't wait to see his face Christmas morning!"
5,Beautiful but functional,This knife is well-constructed and is beautiful to look at. The blade is a good length for hiking and camping but certainly too long just to walk around. The knife comes reasonably sharp from the factory but you may want to add a slightly sharper edge. It is well balanced and cuts well. Other duties such as battoning and chopping would be better left to a more robust knife.
1,TRASH!,"I'm not sure exactly where to start,but I unfortunately have nothing good to say about the Buck 119 special.first of all, I was prying and I broke the tip off the day after purchasing. (I have a CRKT Hammond Desert cruiser tactical folder and put it through the same prying test and the crkt is still as good as new) and now, the handle is loose on the buck, I didn't abuse it at all. This thing will not take an edge, I had a pro try to sharpen it with a diamond stone and it will not sharpen. it is a collector's edition butter knife and a waste of my hard earned money"
1,this knife sucks.,"i havent had this knife a week yet and this ""non corrosive"" stainless steel blade is rusting away.I havent even taking the knife near the water.the rust is weakening the blade to the point were it is breaking away peices of metal. compleat waste of money. dont buy this knife"
2,OUT OF DATE INFOMATION!!,"This book has some good info if you dig really deep and know what you are looking for. It talks about things to do to your AG that are out of date, and could be bad to your birds health. It also speaks of taking the birds out of the jungle, which does not happen very much any more, if at all. If you want a good book about african greys, look at the copyright date, it says a lot."
2,Completely Out Dated,This book may have been a good information book on Grey's back in its day.Though now...NOT SO GOODThe Book title on front cover even got spelling wrong {GRAY}.There is much better books than this on the subject.Book is not worth the shipping cost.
3,Sassy and original.,"An enjoyable read. Bright. Funny. The writing is intelligent and well paced. However, I found the character of Charlie to be affected and I couldn't empathize with her, or even like her very much. She lives in a bubble of her own creation where she's the overly intelligent grad student, the super supple yoga instructor, the girlfriend of a minor television star...and on and on. She lacked warmth. Oddly, the novel didn't."
2,Not a favorite,"Charlie (aka Charlotte), the main character, is not a super-sympathetic character. I did not root for her like I rooted for Bridget Jones or Rebecca from the Shopaholic books. She is one of the most narcissistic and pretentious main characters I've ever read in the genre of the ""chick lit"" novel. The romance between her and Hank was obviously going to go nowhere, and it took a heck of a long time to play it out and I did not care one iota whether she succeeded in the filmmaking world.The author has the potential for a better novel next time as '...Technicolor' was readable despite the problems I had with the story."
4,Personal account of what they did,"This book is mostly about what this family did. That gives me ideas, but I was expecting a more helpful resource of activities to do than just sharing what they did. I will still use some of them, though."
1,Tenchu Z,The camera angles really ruined this game. It seemed your character was always looking in the wrong direction when fighting. You also had to buy clothes before you were allowed to see them.
4,"Very Fun, but a little repetitive","This game is outstanding, except for a bit of bad graphics and a little variety of missions. If you are a ninja fan, Tenchu fan, or someone who wants to try something new, definatley pick this game up."
3,Fun Game,"This game was okay, not good - not baaaaad. Fun to play with FAVES, I really like playing with my FAVES. It's always fun to play with Alpha and Preventer VVind. It's more fun than a football."
2,pyty,this is a pity game for the genre. complete desaponted. tenchu for the ps still the king of the hill.
3,Would love to see a sequel,"If you enjoy stealthy games, then this is it. I'm not sure about the other ninja games on the 360, but this game's focus is on stealth and attack planning. Your mission in almost every level is to assassinate someone usually in a large village. There's some variety where you have to follow someone without being seen or battle a boss, but its pretty much the same thing over and over. I think of it as a stealth-action-puzzle game. The controls can be frustrating sometimes, especially when you want to leap from a roof to kill an enemy. The grapple hook is also a little awkward to use (take some pointers from Just Cause).Stealth is key, for it leads to one hit kills. If you lose stealth, you can still kill your enemy but the fight controls are awkward (which leads to frustrating battles against the bosses).You can find this game for probably 5 bucks at gamestop. For that, I'd say it's worth it. I would love to see a sequel where they clean up the mechanics."
3,not bad. dont pay full price for it.,"overall,this is not a bad game. yes the levels are reapetative. if you like ninjas,and stealth games,you'll dig this. stealth kills are fun no matter how many times you do them. especially grappling hook (mid-air) stealth kills. i wouldn't pay more than 35-40$(new) for it however. multiplayer is ok,it takes forever to find people to join though. so, if you have a hankerin for a ninja stealth game,and have a little money to burn, pick up a copy."
3,freezes all the time,"Its a fun game but frezzes up all the time i can't even play it. The only game i have that does that. The screen will get all F*** Up ! I dont know if its just my copy, oh well.IT WAS MY CRAPPY XBOX 360 THE WHOLE TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RED RING! !!!!!"
4,Good game Bad graghics,The game is good but grghics bad you know i like the game style because i played all the old versions but it is fun to play..............
3,"Not bad, but not the greates either.","Well, I'll start by saying I was a fan of the original tenchu, but lost track of it after that one. If I recall correctly, I came back and played the 3rd one, but it was garbage to me. This new tenchu takes me back to the first time I played the game, so it is a good time to play, and the replay value is super high.Game gets 3 stars from me because of the look. There's no excuses for the quality in graphics, I mean they're not bad but the xbox can do much more and the developers have to know this. Come on guys, take your time on the next one. There's so much that I envisioned while playing the game that I know could have been added in the eye candy department.If you're a fan of the series, go ahead and give it try. Whats the deal with ""From Software"" anyway? They're also the makers of Armored Core and just like this game, its been the same game every installment. You developers need to get on the ball. 5 stars fun factor. 3 stars overall."
3,LOVE,I love the Tenchu series and just wish that they made more current games for this. I would buy them.
2,The re-mastering stinks,"Don't know if the release being offered here is different (the track order on my CD is different and includes 11 tracks total) from mine but it's also on the Collector's Choice Music label and the distortion is terrible. In the CD booklet they state ""The sound heard on the V DISC is the unaltered recording of 78 RPM masters...Even with the most advanced technology, occasional imperfections will be noted by the listener. These imperfections remain as a result of the producer's conviction that historical reissues must strive to duplicate the sound of the original recordings made during this period."" What a load of crap. This is one of the worst V disc remastering jobs I've ever heard."
3,Characters are a must-have,"There are no characters in this book at all! IF you have any intention to get a hold of the language, reading and writing go hand in hand. This will make much more sense when you go over and tyr to ride a bus or converse with someone.The second problem is this doesn't focus on dialogue. Yes, it is interesting to blurt out your newest American-style Chinese Phrase but what are you going to do when your partner replies?Anyway, thumbs down, I'm sending mine back...nice packaging though"
2,Very shoddy,"The book has no Chinese characters, only pinyin. It's not terribly useful for anyone who is seriously interested in learning business Chinese, but if you want to learn a few phrases to impress in a meeting it may do the trick."
5,Incredible Way Of Life,"I think this is an awesome memoir on such an incredible way of life that everyone who has never been there, or especially those who have, should take the time to read. The pictures take me back, and the writing is interesting and not filled with long, boring explanations of things.Go Nancy! I want more."
5,"Great, covers the basics quite well.","This book isn't just for kids as the title might imply but for everyone who wishes to mix a bit of developmental psychology with astrology. Hand covers all the factors in a horoscope quite well. If one wants to learn the basics this is the book to get. Granted some of it does assume a prior knowledge of astrology but not near to the degree a lot of other books do. For a beginning student this Book and Grant Lewi's Heaven Knows What are the one's I would recommend to get the basics of how to interpret a chart. Well done Mr. Hand, well done indeed."
3,not what i expected,The person who sent the book was easy to deal with and quick to respond. The packaging was quite pretty but didn't protect it from being damaged in transit. The book took longer than the alotted time and was more damaged than I was told.
3,Pretty good intro to PR book,"I am minoring in Public Relations and this was the required book for the class. It is pretty straight forward and easy to understand. The layout is great and has been easy to follow.One thing that this book could really use are examples. They only talk about PR plans and news releases, they don't show you what one looks like or how to get started. For those who haven't seen a news release, writing one can been a challenge. A PR plan is almost impossible without at least seeing an example first.However, for just the basics this is a good book."
3,Good for a reference good,"Bought this book for a course. The copy was in decent shape and arrived pronto. This book covers the basics of Public Relations and touches of a vast array of topics under Public Relations management. Topics range from to day-to-day concepts, and it also gives you a background explanation to the insights of a Public Relations agent, their values, the rules of engagement and public awareness.That said, the book is clustered with material. Maybe a more up-to-date version can provide you with a more structured, user-friendly layout of the material.Go for it if you only need to use it as a reference book."
1,I'm really unsatisfied,"I have never received this item. I ordered this item on Sep.1, today is Oct.3, I don't know what can I do. I reorder same item with another seller, I have already received that item. but this item I'm still waiting. Should the seller check for me or how do I get the refund."
4,This Album was Pretty Good but not classic.,"Luis Miguel isn't a bad composer in this one but he should still let others write the songs for him. However, I liked 6 songs outta 12, which is worth buying and I think many others would like it too. The best tracks on the album are ""O Tu O Ninguna"", ""Quiero"", ""Dimelo en un Beso"", ""Te Propongo Esta Noche"", ""Tu Solo Tu"" and ""Amarte es un Placer."" I wouldn't consider this album his best but worth listening too so I would recommend this Album too anyone who's a fan of Luismi."
4,Wonderful voice,Luis Miguel is a great singer. His ballads are beautiful. Some of the songs are too fast for me. I prefer boleros.
4,Excellente!,"This is not a TRADITIONAL latin album, he only sings in Spanish, but it's the best U.S. session cats and some great material and high quality production, and besides he's an exciting vocalist and gutsy performer so I dig this CD very much and I can't speak Spanish at all. I highly recommend it to fans of West Coast AOR. It's fun, funky and romantic.Features the top session vocalists and sessions players from Los Angeles and it won several Grammies. BUY IT!! If you love very much a U.S. R&B; /MOR sound."
5,"""Loving you is a Pleasure"" album is excellent!!!!!","Like Luis Miguel, no one, not even the latin ""star"" of the moment Ricky Martin. Luis Miguel knows what music is, he doesn't need to improve or change the way he does music. His voice is unique as well as the lletters of his songs. As all of his albums, this is a classic one, you must have in your Great Albums Collection. Way to go Luis Miguel, Keep singing in spanish, which is a beautiful language, let everybody hear and understand spanish through your music. This album is 10 stars!!."
1,latin pap,"an OK singing voice with a lot of bland orchestral wallpaper; I really don't like this kind of format generally. I could hardly believe the height of the praise in most of the other reviews. Never heard Luis Miguel before but because of other latin sounds I had quite high expectations. Be sure you know what you're getting before you buy this. Alternatively, if you pay the postage you can have mine free."
3,Yo esperaba mucho mas de este CD,"La verdad este CD de Luis Miguel pudo haber sido mejor, devio haber sido mejor... es pan con lo mismo... tan siquiera que se quiebre un poco mas la cabeza... porque Luis Miguel tiene la capacidad para hacer cosas mucho mas interesantes que lo que ay en este CD.... y otra cosa; ya estoy harta de que comparen a Luis Miguel con Ricky Martin; nada que ver; son estilos completamente diferentes... yo no se porque la prensa insiste en compararlos y rivalisarlos... Micky tiene un estilo muy propio y definido; Ricky tiene el suyo que por cierto le a funcionado muy bien... sus voces son completamente diferentes; su vestuario tambien, su imagen; etc;etc; porque la comparacion... caray; se ve que no tienen nada mejor que hacer.."
3,Ballads/Great-Uptempo songs/Unlistenable,"Luis Miguel should stick to his forte, the ballads, and stop recycling previous unlistenable uptempo songs. He should continue to record songs from talented composers such as Maestro Armando Manzanero.Thanks to programming feature in cd players, you can skip the fluff and enjoy the good songs."
3,Pudo ser mejor,"Trata de mejorar y especialmente perfeccionar, sin embargo a pesar del tiempo y dedicación no resultó perfecto."
5,Nuevamente demostró que es el mejor cantante latino,"Luis Miguel reafirma su excelencia como cantante en este nuevo cd que consta de bellísimas baladas y entretenidas canciones pop. Pero lo más importante es la maravillosa voz que sigue conservando, a diferencia de muchos cantantes de moda, que sólo son esto: moda, pasajera y vana."
4,NOT OF ROMANCES QUALITY......BUT STILL OUTSTANDING!,"I like many others agree he is capable of more. This album will of course ""grow on me"", to the point of obsession,as have the ""Romances"" series ! Luis is outstanding and I look forward to his new releases with great anticipation!"
5,Why has this salsero not been given his due respect!!!!!,"I remember the day I was introduced to a Luis Miguel CD, it was ""Romances"". I only buy vocal artistic cds' were people know how to sing. Whispering and coooing is not singing. Having studio gymnastics replace strength behind a voice is not talent. Either you can sing or you can not! ""Amarte es un Placer"" is a matured Luis and his voice keeps getting better and better. I constantly play ""Soy Yo"". I am genuinely surprised with the funkiness of ""Propongo Esta Noche"" it only demonstrates artisitc growth and the ballads speaking for themseleves. Lastly, the horn section is strong and tight without being overpowering but nothing can describe this mans voice. We have Alejandro, Marc Anthony, Ricky (Vuluve not that English stuff), Ibrahim Ferrer, Julio, and many more to mention here. Luis is in great company. Keep singing my friend."
3,Otro mas,Es un CD agradable por sus baladas y buenos arreglos. No el mejor que tiene pero suficiente para agregarlo a su coleccion.
4,It was a great help to me.,"As a first born, this book helped me understand more about the who & why about myself. It helped to understand my parents and my siblings. It brought to my attention that I am not the only one in my family that is a First Born. Dr. Leman has a great sense of humor which helps lighten up areas that were difficult to read about. He not only provided information about me but also included techniques and processes to help get past some of the bad feelings. This book is not just for the first born. It is for parents and siblings.There were some theories that were interesting but hard to completely believe in."
5,Works great!,"I used this fan as a replacement for a burnt out one in my surrond sound receiver. The fan works great at keeping the unit cool, and it runs very quietly. I am very thankful I got this fan instead of dishing out another $300+ for a new surrond sound system. I did have to modify the male part of the plugin on the motherboard as it was meant for a two wire fan. I just popped off the plastic piece that was designed for the original fan and just plugged the new one in, and presto! Works like a charm."
4,Fine first guide.,"The Audubon First Guide to Weather is one of the best in the series of Audubon First Guides. The book has a decent number of weather formation listings, including: cumulus congestus, cumulonimbus, cirrus, mesocyclones and quite a few others. Stating that the book is kiddish is quite strange, as this book and its content does not seem geared toward kids particularly at all. It is a fine guide for everyone to use in the field.There is only one, less recent edition of this guide sold on the market. It is leatherback like the advanced Audubon Guides, so it will come in as a useful reference."
3,needs two batteries,"This item needs two batteries, although it may cut clean wood on a test bench forever it certainly dies fast in true demo conditions , it charges fast enough but a second battery would make it functional"
2,ReallyToo Bad,"Sorry to say this book couldn't hold me. The repetition and chronicle form soon lost me. A pity, I really looked forward to reading this book being a native New Englander with roots going back to the 1600s. If you want to convince people, first you have to hold them, and if you want to hold them, then you better tell a good story. It has a lovely cover anyway."
4,A Major Time Savor,"Finally a book that delivers exactly what it promises. To put together the initial set of policies for management consideration, I was able to just modify the sample policies to fit our organization. Really a major time saver.Would be better if they were updated to more accurately address server farms but these changes can be made quickly."
3,a good game but not the best,the game is ok but it is just like the 85 version i think there should have been some added additions to make it more interesting.
2,Very short and FRUSTRATING!,"I got this game last year and it's really frustrating! When I started. I beat this game in 1 day, and on the 2nd day I unlocked all the secrets and bonus levels, and filled out the album. And on that day after lunch I beat that Point meter thingie and completed The lost levels. The losy levels were veryfrustrating because of the game's horrible controls. The music ineach level was really lame compared to the SNES'. I give thisboorish game 2 stars because of the graphics and the extras. Everything else in this game stinks like a hog pen."
5,Wonderful Game- Worth the Money,"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is really worth the money. There are 96 levels to explore, 8 racing levels where you race a boo, challenge levels to rack up coins and a great score and medals to be earned for rescueing the princess + more! This is truly the best gameboy game I have and I wouldn't trade it. It was the first one i got and i'm glad i picked it. Way worth the money!"
5,Gamer Chick Loves This Game! 5 Stars All The Way!,"For all you nostalgic Nintendo game buffs, here is the one that came out in the 80's with the game system--Super Mario Brothers! I was definitely a Nintendo buff then, and I am still a classic games buff! I loved the original Mario Bros. game and the strategic yet fun play that this game presents.The bonus coin levels and shooting the little annoying fellas with fireballs, to defeating the dragons, this game is awesome! Great for young kids, and people like me in their 20's who were kids when the first Nintendo game system came out and we were all excited! Even older classic games buffs should enjoy it, it's got enough action and challenge to keep you interested! This along with the classic Pac Man games, Donkey Kong, etc are still the best to me!"
3,I remember the original,I bought this game the other day thinking it would be a good game the only reviews that I had seen were good reviews. Well I disagree. I played the original game on my NES which I still have. The game is awful. The grafics are good but the game play is not nearly what I thought it would be. I would think that nintendo would spend more time on game play than grafics on this one. As a matter of fact Mario is stuck in the castle for 7-4. There doesnt seem to be anything in the castle and he runs out of time before he gets to the end of the castle.
2,So-so,"This game was okay, but impossibly difficult and bland. The actual game is okay, but the fortune telling is lots of fun! So is the rest of the stuff in the Toy Box. Also, there are shortcuts that allow you to entirely skip levels! They are in the ""Dark Levels,"" or dungeons."
4,Old made new,"I've always loved playing Super Mario. It was a video game I grew up with as a girl. The less than perfect graphics, some of the repetitive themes throughout the game...I love all the nostalgia. The only reason I'm giving this only 4 stars is unfortunately the seller was somewhat deceptive. Don't get me wrong, the condition and time it arrived were both great. However, the seller had listed the game as 'new'. Not in 'like new condition' or 'used' but new. I was a little annoyed that when I got the game there were already a lot of things already saved on there. I guess I'm just a little picky in that when a seller describes the condition their product being sold is in, I expect it to actually be in that condition. Again, the game plays great, but like new and new definitely don't count as the same kind of conditions."
5,Awesome!!*~*,This game is sooo much fun!! I love it! There are like 32 different levels and the last ones are really really really hard!! I haven't even gotten past them yet! I am 12 so if you are 8 or older you'd love this. It would probaly be way too hard for younger kids.
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT!,"9 Interesting stories of strange mysteries that can not be solved by science. At all costs, GET THIS BOOK!It is fantastic!"
3,Huge disappointment,My nephew was not at all interested in this book as it didn't shed any light on the mysteries so it was too open ended. I would not recommend it.
1,writing for dummies,"Word to the wise: if you don't know how to write a sentence or structure a paragraph, THEN DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL!Somehow the authors think you can be taught to be literate while writing an entrance essay. Sorry folks, too late in the game!...And these essays... if this is what gets you in, then God help us all. These cliche-riddled-feel-good stories made me nautious. Particularly grating is the god-awful essay that begins ""I met my grandmother through her diaries..""Skip this book, write something and give it to a trusted friend for feedback."
2,spend your money and time on the LSAT,"Don't waste your time. Law school admission is a numbers game most schools ( say 90% ) just assing you a numeric score based on your LSAT score and your grades ( weighted for the difficulty of your college ) and if you score above a certain number you are in, below a number and you are out, and somewhere in between then they MAY look at the other stuff. Most schools get enough applications in the upper group to fill their classes without wasting time reading your essay. Sure, having a great essay can't hurt, but why not work a bit harder on rasing your LSAT score or getting better grades. Those can't fail to raise your chances"
5,An excellent book to get you started!,"As someone who works privately with students, helping them with admissions essays for law school, I highly recommend this book. When students call me in regard to assistance with their essays, I recommend that they first buy this book as a means to get started. The guidelines and essays have helped my clients not only to gather their thoughts, but also to organize and write them into interesting and creative essays. By the time they come to me for feedback and editing, they are well on the way to getting into the law school of their choice."
3,Of Limited Value,"I found this book to be of only limited value. As we all know, essays are only one aspect of the whole law school admissions game, and it is therefore misleading to suggest that writing great essays alone is enough to differentiate you from all the other highly qualified applicants out there. For essays alone, Kaufman's book was pretty helpful. But another book I also purchased, Richard Montauk's ""How to Get Into the Top Law Schools"" was ultimately much more comprehensive and useful in guiding me through the admissions process in its entirety."
2,"OK, but new edition of ""Essays That Worked"" is better","The new edition of ""Essays That Worked for Law Schools"" by Curry and Baer is more up-to-date and has better essays, I thought."
4,most entertaining of the genre....,"eh? I was immediately attracted to the cover of this book. I know, you can't judge a book by its, etc. Well, let me tell you John Freyer had more stuff than my two slighty-past-teenagers combined. He had stuff you thought you threw away, he had stuff you saw last week at a yard sale, he had stuff you saw at an antiques store. The photos, writing and results are entertaining and indicative of the ""one man's trash"" theory of stuff in general. I was struck by the kindred spirits John encountered as he made his odyssey to visit his former stuff; all in all, entertaining, thought provoking, and certainly worth a conversation or two. Made me wonder, ""what if everyone sold all their stuff at the same time.....?"" Picture the postal deliveries, and the friendliness which stuff-swapping could engender. I would have given this 5 stars, really consider it 4.75 rather than 4. Add this book to your stuff."
2,Brilliant idea....but disappointing outcome.,"I bought this book because i thought the idea was brilliant.....a dude selling all his junk and traveling across country visiting the new owners of his former possessions.I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was really hoping to read a chronicle of this guys travels across country meeting the strangers who bought his old possessions and how it changed their lives. All we get are quirky ebay descriptions of used junk, and the disappointed customers who bought them....many of whom didn't want to be apart of his project.I was expecting a contemporary 'On the Road', but all I got was a mini blog about a college student's old junk.It did inspire me to mail the book across country to a friend who might appreciate it more than I."
4,what my husband thinks,"As a child of a child of the depression and as a school teacher I am very very good at holding on to things. Most of my items come from my saying "" I might need this someday"" to standing in the middle of a thrift store in Cape Cod in winter whining ""I neeeeeeeeed this"".My husband wishes that I be inspired by this book. Although he is already impressed at how many used books I clear out of our apartment on amazon.com ""sell yours here""."
3,great for your coffee table.,"this is a cool coffee table book. you can also get some inspiration for your next ebay sell. don't ever think no one else will want your junk- trust me- this book will prove, someone out there is waiting."
4,just like loveburger - well done!,"a great idea that belongs on your coffee table, this book will make onlookers bellow with wonder; a perfect conversation piece.i saw freyer on conan o' brian last night and i think that he should have gotten the watson fellowhip from hamilton college. this project is a lot more interesting than those people that get paid $22k that go to uganda to talk to rocks."
1,Waste of time,"I wouldn't even give this a star if I didn't have to. BORING..and STUPID. I tried so hard to get the concept that this guy is an artist and this was an artistic book but really it was just stupid, he had stupid junky stuff he sold on ebay that other stupid people paid money for, I mean come on, why anyone would bid on an opened container of food, actually want it and then display it in their home when they did get it is way beyond stupidity. I'm just amazed. This so called book is just a waste of time. I pity the poor trees wasted in the printing of it!"
4,Neato!,"This is a very strange but very cool book, and I'll bet the same can be said about its author. If you like clever, unusual guys, and clever, unusual projects, buy this book, or buy it for a friend.I'm thinking that this is just the sort of book my brother would like, and that in the spirit of the author's project maybe I ought to mail him (my brother) my copy. But I don't know that I can bring myself to do it. John Freyer, how did you steel yourself to part with those wool socks?!Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"
2,Not sure it does much of anything,"I bought this in an attempt to give our cats some relief between doses of systemic flea treatments (the fleas in our area have become resistant to Frontline so we had to wait between an ineffective Frontline dose and a very effective Advantage dose). Anyway,our cats are adults but we didn't want anything too toxic so went for this spray. The directions actually tell you to soak the animal with the spray daily - something we didn't feel good about (nor did the cats) so we tried it for spot treatments. It definitely has a strong insecticide odor - if that's how you define 'fresh scent'. I'd be afraid to use it too often on upholstery - the lanolin in it could stain. I did spray it on a couple of fleas that we combed out while they were in my hand and they appeared to be happily swimming around in it until I washed them down the drain.Anyway, unless you plan do thoroughly douse you pet with this every day I don't see that it does much - at least it didn't for us."
3,blade not centered in it's closed position,"one of the feature that stood out in the videos was how the blade was centered in the closed position... mine was not, appears that it might be touching."
5,American Classic,"There's a reason this knife design has been made for decades. It's solid, locks up tight with no wiggle, feels heavy and is nicely finished. The 112 is a little smaller than the 110. I find the 3"" blade of the 112 to be a little more wieldy than the the larger model for general usage. The handle portion fits nicely in the hand. I've been a fixed blade user for a long while, avoiding locking blades but this knife has changed my view of folding knives. If you don't have a 110/112, you need to get one."
5,Well made knife,"I grew up with my dad having Buck knifes, so when my husband mentioned that he wanted a knife, I immediately thought of a Buck. My husband loves it. It's very well made."
4,A treat for Doris day fans!,"This disc is a real treat for anyone who's ever lamented how Doris day's gal-next-door vocals often got buried under heavy string sections (or was bouyed by them, depending on your point of view...) The opening tracks simply feature her and a spare piano accompaniment, courtesy of Page Cavanaugh and his lightly audible trio... Even when backed by a slightly larger combo, Day's vocals are still unchallenged, and fill center stage. Maybe not the most vigorous performances of her career, but a nice chance to hear her in a relaxed, casual setting. Doris Day fans will definitely not want to miss out on these rare early 'Fifties radio transcription recordings."
3,Unique perspective on marriage and child rearing,"Sandra Bem is an American psychologist known for her work in gender studies. This book is based on her own life, in which she details how she and her husband's marriage worked and how they chose to raise their children in a gender aschematic way. What I liked was that the book ended with interviews with her son and daughter at the end, so the reader could hear their perspective on their childhood experience. Overall, it's a good read if you're interested in psychology of gender."
5,Better that the Movie,"I watched the movie and was terribly disappointed... So many of my friends had encouraged me to watch it.NOW, after reading this book, I say ""Read the book and forget about the movie!""Definitely, the book is better than the movie. More informative, more accurate (IMHO) and easier to understand."
2,A hurried and uninformed look at an important film,"There is something for everybody in this book because it seems to have been mainly a cut-and-paste editing project without any basis of understanding by the author.When appearing stuck on a physics issue, Bruce deferred to an ""anonymous physics guru"" who checked the facts and made the determination of good or bad science.As a college research project, the glossary does provide a nice definition of terms that is useful.On the plus side, it did prompt me to read ""The Yoga of Time Travel"" by respected physicist Fred Alan Wolf. Now there's a provocative read."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews but seeing as this is the worst book I've read in a really long time, it seemed warranted. If you're looking for a book that expands upon the theories presented in the film, you've come to the wrong place. The so-called author takes excerpts from various writings (not her own, of course) and then throws in some propaganda for the controversy surrounding the ""physicists"" interviewed in the film. It was presumptuous and completely devoid of any originality. Please do yourself a favor and save the $10, it's honestly not worth it. Oh, and I would have rated it with zero stars but Amazon requires at least one. What a waste!!! You'd have a better time having all of your nose hairs pulled out one by one."
1,This book is not what it seems,"I ordered this book along with Down the Rabbit Hole. All the promotions would lead one to believe that I would learn more about the movie and the information in it. The author is on a mission to discredit everything about the movie and the people and organizations associated with it, including me, the viewer.This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. I am disappointed that someone would take the time to write it. The author says she is amazed that such a movie would be made. The movie has much more credibility than this book. She has used the Bleep's populatity to promote and sell her useless book. Any good review has to be planted."
3,Bleep that Blooped,"Not as good as ""What the Bleep Book"".Most of these books I read more than once, but not this one."
2,disappointed reader,This Book instead of expanding the ideas in Bleep spends most of it's time in useless diatribes about those who critizised Bleep.Get over it!The title seemed to indicate an expansion of bleep topics instead it was a retrograde.
3,Needs updating,"Although the book is useful, it is a bit outdated. 1998 is 14 years ago. The technology has evolved for DJing. As an example the author outlines the type of media DJ's use to play music. Cassettes, mini discs, CD's and vinyl. Today DJ's are using Hard drives and/or vinyl.Costs have change too. It would be good if the author would update the book to account for changes in technology and the business of DJing."
2,Messy looking,"I expected more from this jaket it looks like you've slept in it, I'm going to take it to a tailor to see if they can shape it or stiffen it up a little. It's a beautiful color but other than that I am disappointed."
3,Better than nothing,"Biased because I abhor the word dummies in all their books, I really didn't want to buy this book. However for beginners there just isn't much available. Although the information is there, I don't think it is really organized to suit the learning pattern of someone who is really just learning, computers or the web."
3,Good startup procedure driven book. Need volume II,"It is easy to get started and implement applications quickly using this book. Doing real world applications we need further insight into handling persistence, architecture fit for application semantics, writing resource managers, resource dispensers, enlistment, thread-safety/thread affinity etc. A volume II to supplement microsoft documentation will be desirable at this time"
2,A book for MTS beginners,"I found this book to be mainly about how to set up, configure and tune the MTS server and unfortunatly very litte about how to create applications based on the infrastructure offered by MTS. Most of the information in the book can be found in the MTS help files so for an experienced MTS developer this book doesn't give much new insight on the subject."
2,Great for beginners to programming weak for actual developer,"This book is really the only book available so you have no choice right now. This book was blatantly written for 1.0, which may be ok. It offers great simple examples but offers very little to no help for serious development. Light reading, can finish the book in 3-4 days"
1,There isn't very much technical substance.,"I read this book cover to cover on a plane trip between San Francisco and Houston. How much substance could it have? Most of the book is devoted to installation and exploring.This is definitely not a designer's or developer's selection. When I would look up anything even slightly advanced, such as what a resource dispenser is (let alone how to write one), I would get nothing beyond cursory handwaving reference to the SDK.Read the SDK documentation instead!"
2,For absolute beginners...,"This book serves as an adequate introduction to MTS but won't carry you very far. Like so many books about Microsoft technology there isn't enough technical depth and there are too many trivial examples. In addition with the advent of the Visual Studio 6 set of products the book is becoming quickly dated. However, as mentioned earlier the book still serves as an adequate introduction to MTS and what is now being called the Windows DNA architecture. Best suited for absolute beginners."
2,"Decent intro, needs more substance","Being (at the time) the only book (other than Microsoft documentation) on MTS, this was a decent introduction to MTS concepts. It was, however, lacking in some of the lower-level details and, in addition to some annoying mismatches between the book and the CD-ROM, it spent too much time on parroting MTS installation materials and doing COM tutorials."
4,Intriguing mystery.,"Strachey, as usual, is a fun read, and this is a well constructed murder mystery, filled with enough twists and turns to keep the reader on his toes. Of course, our hero occasionally heads in the slightly wrong direction but that's part of his charm. There's an interesting, if rather frightening, focus of sexual aversion treatment which ties the strange cast of characters together. Another Stevenson success!"
2,Could have been better,"This book is about the social causes of WW I. Adams points the finger at how manhood was defined, at the gulf between the sexes and how men desired the company of other men, at the boredom created by the Industrial Age, at how killing and blood-letting were prized, and at a crazed nationalism as the defining causes. Unfortunately, the book lacks power and by the end is nothing more than a diatribe against war."
5,Perfect,"Works perfectly. It's really convenient if you swap hard drives all the time. Works every time, and I've had no troubles with it at all. I use it to burn DVDs too, works like a charm with that too."
1,It did not work for me,"I used it with a Seagate Barracuda 7200.7, 120Gb, configured as master.It recognized the HD correctly, assigned a letter, but as soon as I would transfer data to it disconnects.I tried with an usb HUB, and behing the computer directly, no difference, same problem.I ended up buying the Vantec IDE to USB adapter, it works perfectly on the same configuration."
5,"shipped as promised, performed as advertised","What more can you ask for. Arrived as promised, performed as advertised. A definite must for any IT guy to get data from any old drive"
4,Great Device,"This cable worked great right out of the box, giving one the ability to connect a loose hard drive to your computer via the USB 2.0 port. All functionality is there, drag and drop, etc. Great way to recover data if something goes wrong with the boot process, or a missing operating system error. Just be careful when you place the cable onto the connector pins of the hard drive. Since the cable is both a 3.5"" and 2.5"", it just requires some care to get it on correctly."
1,Absolute Junk,"It is ashame a reputable comany has not picked this idea up and made a quality, dependable product out of it. It is a priceless idea for the repairmen/technicians. The unit I received did not work on any drive... it was just ""sweat shop"" made junk, never tested or QA'd. It was even some generic product... there was no name anywhere on the item or the box."
1,Doesn't work,"This device, rarely, if ever, works.It sometimes is recognized by the computer as being connected, and then doesn't show the drive correctly. I have tested this device on three different computers with 4 different IDE drives before I wrote this review."
1,Very bad experience!,"I bought this product for my computer's external DVD burner. As soon as I plugged it in, I saw fumes coming out of the burner and a burning smell.I had double checked the voltage rating on the burner and also the adapter. Both matched!!I had to THROW AWAY my burner and buy a new one.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF ITS RATING MATCHES YOUR DEVICE'S NEEDS!!!I hope it helps you!"
2,Perfect for tech geeks GREAT FOR BACKING UP,I sure needed this thing my old pc burned out so i needed access to my hard drive and this is the solution for my needs it worked like a charm but my first try i shocked my first hard drive what i did was plug it in the wall and then to my hard dish it shocked it and killed that hard drive...but i learned now you have to connect the usb to pc then the power supply to the HD then lastly to the wall...SO I ASK ANY ONE THAT BUYS THIS TO BE CAREFUL IT CAN BE TRICKY IF YOU DON'T KNOW---LUCKY FOR MY I TESTED IT ON A HARD DRIVE THAT WAS'NT THAT IMPORTANT TO ME O AND ((I also tryed it with my dvd burner and burned a movie with the burner connect to usb)) it rocksI THINK THE POWER SUPPLY BURNT OUT ON ME I GUESS THATS BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP IM BUYING A BETTER ONE ..ONE WHERE THE POWER SUPPLY HAS A ON AND OFF WHICH
1,Terrible Product,"I bought two of these. Both of the casings around the adapter broke. The wiring is shoddy. The power cable does not fit very well into the power supply and comes loose easily. Also, the fittings where you plug it into the drive are not very snug and come loose easily. Go with something slightly more expensive that isn't such a hunk of junk."
5,clean and tight,"I like this adapter very much. The cables are of adequate length and of good quality. The IDE connectors are keyed to help protect against improper connection. The housing is clean and tight. All in all, very nice for its intended purpose."
2,Sabrent USB-2535 USB 2.0 to IDE cable,"Good cable to use with spare HDDs. However, for some reason, the USB connector requires inserting and removing from the computer USB connector in order for computer to recognize the Sabrent USB-2535. It is a little frustrating, but it permits me to be able to use the several HDDs that I have collected from old computers without spending too much money for individual external HDD cases."
5,Just As Advertised,I needed to get into a couple of drives I had stashed from my old puter. This thing worked as advertised. I was able to access the contents with ease. Hard drive showed up immediately in my computer. Grabbed the other drive and did the same thing and had acces to all the data I was looking for. Good product and I would highly recommend it.
3,Does What You expect,Product whipped well and does what you expect.Would purchase again if I needed another one.
1,"Good idea, horrible execution","I bought this to recover data from a drive after I upgraded to a computer that only supported SATA connections. First, the power supply included is incredibly cheap. It broke after about a day, and the cheap casing is easily broken. This makes it prone to electrical related injuries and it's extremely likely to cause a fire if left unattended.Secondly, it only worked with about 1/3 of the drives I have. Out of six drives, only 2 worked 100% of the time with this. No matter what jumper settings I used, the others would either not work at all or would disappear from Windows right after being installed. I will be avoiding products from this company in the future."
4,Intricate maze of selfish motives in a Russian village.,"The Petty Demon is a turn of the century symbolistic novel set in a small Russian village. Many self-absorbed characters interact with only their own best interests in mind and attempt to deceive, mislead and cheat each other while the main character 'Peredonov' attempts to secure a school inspector's position for himself. A side plot is the unnatural relationship between Lyudmila (a young woman) and Sasha (a pre-pubescent male whom is often mistaken for a girl dressed as a boy). Lyudmila is obsessed with pagan thoughts about the young boy and pursues him in a slightly sexual manner without becoming a truly sexual relationship. Peredonov begins the novel as slightly disturbed and ends the novel by becoming completely mad and commiting murder in a fit of paranoia-induced rage."
4,The bug Screen is,Easy to put on. Just follow the simple directions. It also looks faily good. I put it on and left it on. No complaints.
1,don't know,"Amazon sent the wrong item so I had to return it. Worse, it was too late to replace it so I had to use a camping chair at the beach.That would have been bad enough, but that chair got sand in the slider/closing mechanism was are impossible to close, had to leave itat the beach the second day. 3rd day had no chair until I bought a boring overpriced beach chair on the boardwalk."
1,"blue, not black","if you want a blue chair, this is fine, but it's not what's pictured. the photo is completely off on the color."
1,"Arrived Broken, Footrest Seems Prone to Breaking Off","These chairs had great reviews, so I ordered 11 to give the guys in my upcoming wedding. While we were gift wrapping the chairs, we happened to take one out of the shipping box and found that the plastic piece that connects the rod of the footrest to the seat of chair broke off at some point.The seat appeared to have been securely packaged and folded in a way that shouldn't allow much pressure on this piece. The fact that it managed to break in this manner leads me to believe that the plastic is inferior or the piece is under-engineered. I can only imagine what would happen to the footrest under the weight of a person using this chair normally throughout a summer, or if a child were to sit on it. We sent all 11 back."
2,Didn't meet our expectations,"We have returned the chairs.They were a very good construction. hOWEVR THEY IN FACT WERE TOO LOW TO THE GROUND AND WERE VERY NARROW IN THE WIDTH and we are not obese.(16O LBS.)Also the height of the chair was too low for our necks and we are only 5'10"" and 5'9"" So really we were very disappointed"
2,Disappointing product,"We bought two chairs and were so disappointed. When we first got them, one chair arrived with a broken backpack clasp and had to be returned. Then the replacement chair had a problem with mismatched reclining slots on the arms, at which point we decided to go ahead and return both chairs for a refund. They were very heavy to carry as backpack chairs for any length of time, and they were not as ""all day"" comfortable as we expected them to be when we took them to an all-day music festival. Also, the footstool is advertised as being able to fold upward and serve as a table, but it works awkwardly at best because it wobbles instead of anchoring into a firm position. All in all, not worth the money."
3,"Smart design, but cheaply made","I like this chair. It works well as a back pack with plenty of room for gear. I like the footrest/desk. It's really smartly designed. It's obviously been put together on the cheap, though. I can't see this thing lasting more than a couple of seasons. It's too bad. Had they put this thing together properly with quality materials, it would be a great product."
4,Che as a Guerilla Leader,"Good book, but be prepared. Che was a failure as a guerrilla leader because he refused to accept the possibility that a revolution could begin and end in major population centers. He reallty didn't have many wins to his favor when he was in charge."
5,Beautiful toy!,This is a nice size and pretty solid and well-made. I was pretty pleased with getting this for my son.
5,Schleich Stable,"I bought this stable as a gift for my two granddaughters, ages 4 and 2. They loved it and immediately got out their Schleich horses and started playing. I love the durability of the stable (it is made of wood) and with the removable roof, the girls had easy access to the inside. The little half doors came off a little too easily, but no problem to put them back on. The girls will play with this stable for many years to come!"
4,"good quality outside, flimsy on the inside","My daughter loves this stable, it goes with Schleich horses and it's too small for Breyer. The only thing I don't like is that the fencing is pretty cheap. The building is really nice though. Good quality, sturdy, should be around for a while. I would buy it again."
4,Great Pick,"This cd is a little above average. It is fast and very pulsating, quickly putting you in the mood to go to a club and get wild. However it lags in the middle. The start is strong with more of a funky freestyle breakbeat type of music, the end is a mixture of some overplayed trance and house songs with a few twists and energetic remixes that make some of the songs ring through as if new. The middle though is boaring and very bland, causing you to either loose interest or skip to the end. With just a few song replacements this cd would be unbeatable when in the mood to get down."
3,a simple delight,"this is a fun little side project from some members of japan's experimental music community. there is a strong pop base to some of the structured songs on this disc and the group's playful side shows through really well on tracks like ""Happy Mail"" and the last half of ""Jellyfish"". these tracks come accross as the most solid and memorable cuts from this album. the remainder of the songs utilize some nice electronics, and the koto playing is fabulous; but overall, this album is frustratingly short on brilliance. but if taken at face value, Ohayo! Hoahio! can be enjoyed for the simple fun experience that it is."
4,Includes the entire Korngold concerto,"I am adding this brief review to make certain people are aware that this DVD DOES INCLUDE the entire three movement Korngold Violin Concerto. Although it is used during the brief documentary at times, an entire live performance of the concerto can also be cued by selecting EXTRAS from the DVD menu. It is then that you get to listen to the concerto without interruption or voice-overs.It is a fine performance of a wonderful concerto and I believe justifies purchasing this DVD alone."
5,A review of Casework: A Psychosocial Therapy,"As a graduate social work clinician of 15 years, I turn to Casework: A Psychosocial Therapy to renew my understanding, hone my skills, and refresh myself on the particulars of treatment techniques and procedures involved in individual, family, and couple work. There are few books that blend theory and the ""how-to"" of clinical practice in the ways that this book does. It is an exceptionally clear text. This book reminds the clinician of the importance of listening closely to what is important to clients as opposed to imposing upon them what we think should be important to them. Respect for the client is foremost, and this book underlines this and other values which represent the best our profession offers. It is the definitive test in psychosocial casework, and I heartily recommend it to others."
2,Watch OK but hard to read the dial,"This watch has good features, especially an easy to set alarm. The drawback is that it's very difficult to read the time, especially in the dark with the Indiglo. The hands are in part cut-out, so that you can't instantly tell the time. Rather you have to study the dial to figure out the time. It's not a fatal flaw, but it's annoying to have to spend more than a split second looking at the dial to tell the time."
3,could be a lot better,"i believe donny mccaslin is one of the most beautiful musicians i have ever seen. i dont remember ever being more moved by a soloist than i have been by donny. however, this record does not manage to capture the incredible intensity and honesty of his playing. the album sounds like the product of a producer's demands more than donny's genius. go see donny play instead and wait for something else to come out with him on it."
3,Kind of flimsy.,"I tried to give it a chance and see how it went but this music box, although ""cute"" could stand to be a little more durable but, it put a smile on the child's face SO it'll do."
2,Quality is terrible,"The quality is terrible on this dvd and needs to be updated. It was shot with old school camera equipment and then converted to dvd. They really should have reshot it with a better camera as educational videos are hard enough to watch without this bad of quality. He does accomplish showing typical press moves but the video is way too dated. I'd order the dicedealer press moves dvd over this one, although the dicedealer one is pretty well dated as well."
4,A maginificent visual cinema,"I just saw the movie at the 11th LALIFF Los Angeles International Film Festival. And I have to say is a hard movie to watch, but amazing ride to see. Visually is incredible, the shots, the artistic way to Antonio moves the camera and the actors are doing an excellent job. As for the story... no much to say, doesn't go anywhere. But the director save the movie."
2,It's a photocopy from a library book,"I'm not going to review the content of this book (which by the way is awesome) but the product itself because this is where I was disappointed. This book is basically bounded photocopies of a library volume which originally had pencil underlinings and notes on the margins, all wrapped up in a pretty cover. I wanted to give it to a friend as a gift and was very disappointed when I saw it, not to mention too embarrassed to give it away, so I ended up keeping it and having to buy a 'real' version at a local bookstore. It's certainly cheap but if you are looking for a decent quality book to give away or to add to your personal library I would not recommend this."
4,this book was a good read,"this book is very interesting for those who would like to know more about the general aspects of ibo culture. this book tells about the language, education, work, and marriage rituals of women. totally recommended for people who would like to learn more about africa"
4,A different approach,"You really have to approach this recording differently than subsequent PT releases. It does not have the songwriting strengths that Steve Wilson shows later, and it does not pretend to. You have to compare it to releases like DJ Shadow's ""Endtrodoucing..."" and the work that Bill Laswell has done with Material. When viewed on these terms, this recording is a masterpiece.Ultimately, though, this was originally released as two recordings, one with Phase One and Two, and another with remixes in the guise of Phases Three and Four. One and two are truly sublime, but three and four do not make the same philosophical statement that one ane two do. the net effect is an uneven recording.However, Phases One and Two are so provocative that they are worth the price of the CD. In the end, Voyage 34 is not a bad buy."
5,A good PT effort,"Porcupine Tree manage to make a great album with Voyage 34. It was originally released in vinyl so it is nice to see it in cd.What I lke about this cd is that Steve Wilson, along w/ the musicians that accompanied him in this disc, make great music. Some say it resembles Pink Floyd, but I think that aside the obvious resemblence it has sometimes, the music shines through the way only this group could do it. Wilson manages some good guitar solos, and the melodies that make up most of the disc are really good. Good for an early offering..What I did not like about this album is the excessive narrating. Other than that this CD is a masterpiece deserving all 5 stars."
2,"You don't need this if you have ""Stars Die""","If you already own the ""Stars Die"" collection, which contains Phase I of Voyage 34, you don't need to buy ""The Complete Trip"", since Phases II, III and IV are just deconstructions of the more sturdier and musical Phase I. The emphasis on the latter pieces is on the repetitive tape loops and drum machines, with increasingly less and less actual live music playing.I don't mind the narrations but I would like more live band and less computer sequencers(which is all you get towards the end)."
5,Prescription for Anxiety Review,"This book is amazing. It tackles anxiety with gentleness and grace, all with a Christian perspective. I highly recommend this for patients as well as therapists."
4,Embrace find their own voice,"Yes, the songs are pretty similar in tempo... and they do all follow a similar pattern of moody verse rising to soulful chorus... but at last Embrace seem to have found their own voice. It was always a hollow accomplishment writing good songs that sounded like some one else. If you liked the first album (probably because you liked Oasis) then this may not be your cup of tea. If you've progressed to guitar music with a richer texture then this is worth a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised by the first three tracks and found myself humming the chorus hooks on the subway - always a sign of a worthy song..."
1,Waste of money...,"I liked only one song off this entire album...""Scamander"". I bought it for three reasons:1.) because of that song (with the hopes that the rest of the album was similar),2.) because the album was compared to work done by Amon Tobin,3.) because DJ Spooky was on it.I am -very- disappointed with it. I guess someone may enjoy it if they like -super- abstract music."
4,It was gift,From what I could tell the person I gave it to really liked it and it was in really good condition =)
2,Lacking.,"In 1986, no doubt Ronald Shannon Jackson had a challenge on his hand-- the Decoding Society had pretty much scattered, and with the loss of such powerful musicians, assembling a new band to succeed them was a difficult task. The second generation Decoding Society, guitarist Cary DeNegris, bassist Reginald Washington, violinist Akbar Ali and saxaphonist Eric Person on this recording persons in conjunction with African singers/percussionists Twins Seven Seven. The result of the collaboration, while interesting, lacks much of the fire that the older Decoding Society had.By and large the pieces are invested in funky African rhythms, they have a nice sound, the playing is good all around (particularly Washington, who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between Jackson's rhythms), but there's by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record. It just doesn't burn. The band did much better work, this is a curiosity piece more than having any intrinsic value."
5,Fantastic religious music,A strange beginning for a mass but the whole work developes into a modern and traditional experience of dimensions! I imagine it is a challenging work to perform especially for the soprano voices. A gift that I am very glad to have received.
4,Not your normal Mass.,"Carl Jenkins is not loved by the critics, but who writes for them anyway? The Mass, as typified by Bach and those who followed became highly stylised; Jenkins breaks this model and takes a far more ecumenical view - I doubt that this Mass would be welcome in many Roman Catholic churches - and a lot of protestant ones would agree.Commencing with a medieval French song - ""Beware the Armed Man"" the Mass then proceeds to Islam with the Call to Prayer: Allah is great, there is no other god but Allah, sung by a muezzin.There follow a number of excursions into the classical Mass, interwoven with poetry from the likes of Dryden, Kipling and Tennyson and also Togi Sakichi reflecting on Hiroshima. A verse from the Mahabharata could also refer to the bomb, however this work dates back to the 4th century and earlier.The work is confronting, challenging and evocative.I liked it."
4,A Modern Classic Candidate,Choral selections can be hard to understand. This is not unique to this recording. The orchestra balance is well done.
4,A piece featuring Mass texts,"I normally have an inbuilt dislike for setting of the Mass texts which are blatanly liturgically useless (eg. Vivaldi's Gloria), but I have to admit to quite liking this.It really is inaccurate to describe it as a Mass setting: it is a concert piece which simply happens to feature some Mass texts. Looked at in this way, its positive features come through.The combination of medium and message is masterful. The choices of text are clever and respected by the music, which preserves their individual integrity whilst still creating a coherent piece of music.Sometimes the music is a little obvious (eg. the percussion before ""Bloody Men"" in the chant section), but sometimes this is needed when writing for a diverse audience."
3,Not As Substantial As I Thought,"This item was VERY lightweight. I was expecting something a little more heavy because it's for outdoor use. It was however, colorfast when rained upon and doesn't skid so time will tell. But in its humor, there was nothing else under the tree at our house that got as many laughs. It was a favorite among of our college age family members and we all know how difficult it is buying for this age group. Sometimes a laugh is more important!"
5,It sure is a doormat,"This doormat is a doormat, I mean it works just like a doormat! It also says ""come back with a warrant"" on the doormat which I find humorous. That's why I bought it. It's a doormat!"
3,It's not just a doormat.,"It is very thin and lightweight and has a cheap feel. It will blow away with a strong wind. But I bought it to be funny, not functional."
4,VERY THIN,"Thin, but has held up well so far. This would NOT be good if you want to use it for its intended purpose - scraping muddy boots, ice, etc."
2,Perfect! For just the first week... :(,"I was so happy to receive this! Very funny. It even came with a comical label describing the manufacturers. We were very happy. But very quickly the lettering wore off! We got it around October 2010, and now, in January 2011, the lettering is faded and barely visible. Pathetic!!!!"
4,Love it!,"I'm attorney and I know all too well that the police don't always follow the law. So I love that I can remind them that I do know the law, and it requires a warrant before they'll be entering my house. My friends all think it's pretty funny too. Other reviewers are right though - this mat is kind of thin and not super durable. I put mine on my porch and it's lasted a year without fading, but it helps that it's protected from the elements. It's still definitely worth buying for the entertainment factor - just don't expect to it last too long if you plan on using it to scrape your boots daily."
3,Humorous But Flimsy,"Although meant to replace a ""WELCOME"" mat at your front door, this is more just for humorous purposes as the writing is on a basic, cheap carpet. Also, very lightweight carpet which may not stay in place if the wind hits it hard. I go into my home through the garage and havent had too much traffic on the mat yet, but I believe its only purpose is humor."
5,Awesome,"I just moved into my new apartment and my friends love it, great buy, very cool accessory for the front door"
1,Display model is great but it was DOA,"I got this and it was very impressive as a very nice looking model.My bike was dead on arrival, no sound and no radio control action.It had some shipping damage. The bike looks great but is very delicate.The radio control system was totally dead.The company (NEW BRIGHT) offers no support for this model as it was discontinued 2 years ago.Buy this if you only want a very nice large static display model."
4,Great performance,"So much energy and drama can be found in these works--most by baroque folks you never heard of. I gave it 4 stars because of the music... yes, it's good music, but these are not masterworks.My favorite track is a short, but wild one where the violin goes out on a solo that's got drive and passion behind it, not to mention some sassy percussion.These pave the way to later symphonies by the young Mozart, or Haydn."
1,I lost my money.,"When I bought this product, I believed that it was an improved version of the ""Movie Factory 6.0 Plus (old version), but the installation failed because it asks for the serial number of the ""old version"", that I do not own. I lost my money."
1,Nice little waste of money,"The whistle end of the barbell is just superglued in there, it just popped out after the 3rd time trying to whistle with it. If you want to spend a dollar per use, buy this, but i doubt you'll even be able to screw the bottom on without the whistle coming off instead"
1,Tire size is not right,Tire size stated is not correct because it will not stay on the rim when aired up to proper psi!
5,Very Enjoyable,"Nick Parle (winner of the Bruges International Keyboard Competition) is Australia's best known harpsichordist. Unfortunately for us 'down under' he spends most of his time in the UK. An excellent recording, by one of the worlds best players on a superb instrument. One of those discs you will have on your player for weeks. Possibly the definitive version of this major keyboard work on a wonderful instrument built after historic examples.Highly recommended."
1,Dont waste your money,I thought that you might have to have a special sized marshmellow to fit through the shooter but you dont these are just expensive mini marshmellows you can pick up from your grocery store.
1,Broke,Even after visiting a website to view how to use this tool; filing down the chain as recomended; the metal flanges designed to hold the chain in place bent down and made the tool useless.
1,Not worth the money,This item is a piece of ####. The plastic holding it in was not on and the links were lost from the package. You can purchase a high quality one from Meijer a lot cheaper.
2,Typos abounded.,"I didn't like this book at all. The typos kept throwing my mind off--they needed a proofreader DREADFULLY.The whole book was set up in a very disorganized, unhelpful, skipping-over-things way that threw my mind. It was like reading someone's lecture notes--useful in its way, but not comprehensive.And the writing was very 8th grade. Repetitive sentence structure, un-professional-sounding, and that distracted me too."
4,I liked using the book,"Yes, there were typos here and there but overall the information the book provided was great. It helps you analyze information so it doesn't review almost every event in US history, it gives you a nice overview of the most important events that will most likely be used when writing the DBQ or free-responses. The questions at the end of each chapter were good to use because they seemed as if they were extracted from a previous AP exam. I believe that this is a good review book for incoming AP students. I received my score the other day and I did get a 5 so I believe the book helped my score along with my hard efforts in class."
2,Do not Get,"I cannot express my deep dissatifaction for this book. I am expected to take this AP test in May and to review from this book is a joke. There were gramatical errors, as well as a few spelling errors. I dont even know if i could use the info given in this book to write an essay on the ap test considering the errors in there. Take something everyone knows like Barons eddition or princeton review. This book is a waste."
3,apush student,"although this book is quite useful, it should definitly as the other reviews stated, NOT be used alone. i personally found the glossary to be inadequite in that only MAJOR key terms were definied while less major but still significant terms were left out. overall though it is an excellent book to be used in conjunction with another study book as some less significant topics are left out in this book. the book has clear concise and detailed chapter summaries."
2,Only if you know your stuff,"I bought this book after many people in my APUS class raved about it. Unfortunatley, the book is filled with misspellings and some factual errors. If I had not known for sure that certain facts were wrong, I would have trusted this book. Do not get this book if you expect it to guide you through APUS, the explanations are much too shallow. Also, the multiple choice questions tended to be a bit unchallenging"
3,IF YOU LIKE HARLEQUINS...,"For a vampire afficianado, this book offers very little. It's not bad as a romantic novel, though. For a serious, feminist vampirologist such as myself, this book is disappointing especially for its stereotypical fe/male roles and attitudes."
4,"""Oldies But Goodies""","Nothing To Write Home About..Basically, Your ""Standard Mix"" of 80's Era Top 10's..But A Good Addition to Anyone's Collection Bin..Worth the Price Too!"
2,Not impressed,"I bought this album after reccommendations based on my liking of Helios, Xela, Autechre, and other ambient electronica. Unfortunately, it's a real let down. There are a couple of pleasant ambient numbers and a couple of tuneful classical pieces but aside from that there seems to be a lot of 'padding'. A lot of the tracks are so short they become pointless, and a number of the songs employ somewhat irritating percussion. I am also concerned about the recording quality of this album. Listening to it using decent headphones there is a lot of background hiss. I don't know if this is intentional or due to poor quality recording but it is certainly annoying. Sad really, because the guy clearly has potential but this would have been better as a short EP."
3,Microsoft Project 2003 seems to be an afterthought,"This book does a very good job of explaining the essentials of project management, as well as basic project management theory. The problem for me lies with the ""with Microsoft Project 2003"" part of the book - the lack of practice or at least example files. Screen shots illustrating various Project 2003 screens were just not enough for me - I needed to see (and the book should have referred to) actual sample Microsoft Project projects. In addition, it could have been a bit more comprehensive - I found that a lot of basic Project 2003 how to information was missing. Project 2003 is a very feature rich application and this book just scratches the surface. I think the Microsoft Press Step-by-Step volume is a much better introduction to using this application for project management (although not as strong on the theory)."
4,Does what it says on the tin,"Good read that gave me lots of handy hints and tips, both in project management itself and in using Project 2003. A definite buy."
4,Awesome,"My brother used this book and received a 5 on his exam. Obviously he worked hard during the year, but he said the comprehensive review was extremely effective and instrumental in his getting the 5."
5,Thoughtful and all-inclusive,I highly recommend this introduction to philosophy for anyone with an interest in learning (or learning more) about the subject. The author opened a few windows for this linear thinker!
1,"Games were too elementary,","Games were not for adults, but rather, for children. I will end up sending it to my grandchildren. Games are not very much fun either."
3,This is a decent book...,"I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned the text was very disorganized. Much of the information provided is very redundant, hence the book could have been much shorter (and less expensive).Synopsis: National cultures and laws affect accounting standards used by different countries. The book discusses the major differences of accounting in great detail. There is a push by the International Accounting Standards Board to harmonize accounting standards so that international financial statements will be more comparable. Will they succeed? Read this book and then decide for yourself."
2,Needs extensive editing and reorganization.,"This text suffers from its haphazard organization and lack of clarity in presentation. Textual material could be simplified if presented in tabular form. Text also suffers from lack of precision in references to accompanying tables. Material and citations tend to be a hodgepodge of older and, in some cases, obsolete studies done by other academicians."
3,Battery hog,"My daughter has used this for two years now. Nice quality photos, inexpensive and very good for enthusiasts who want a lot of control over their photography. However it is slow in processing info and it eats batteries like they are M&M's Rechargeable litiums help but you still need two pair. Rather a hassle and expensive."
2,Better than nothing.,"I was hesitant with this camera. The indoor pictures aren't the best, but they'll do. During a recent trip to Arizona, I got the chance to appreciate this camera. But if you want a fast-shooting, panoramic kind of camera, you'd be better buying a camera from Sony, Nikon, or Canon."
3,Scruffy and unwashed...,"In as much as its predecessor ""Deep Space"" was a sparkling gem of musical and mystical enlightment, ""Beach Fervour Spare"" sorely lacks artist commitment and inspiration. Notably the first track drags a bit and sets the scene for what is to come; the overall feel is like a Sunday morning after a night of excess. Nevertheless, the new drummer and guitar player set some highlights - ...may be the next time..."
4,Nice Ice Pack.,"Good icepack, have had NO problems with this product. Fast shipping, freezes well and is still flexable. Definately worth the money, everyone should have one on hand."
