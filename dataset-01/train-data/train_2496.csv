2,Mistake!,"I bought this book based on the positive user reviews. I have spent seven hours working through it already. The language and instructions are easy to understand, and I appreciate that. However, I worked through the introduction to the logic games section and found a mistake. They use an example where there is a condition listed and then they give a ""correct"" answer to a question although that answer directly violates the prior condition. It makes me nervous that a book that is supposed to help me do well on the test has a mistake that I found, and I haven't been doing this for very long. I'm buying a different study aid!"
4,Very helpful,Have not received my last score yet but I am very confident I did well because I read this book and followed his suggestions
3,Not as helpful as Kaplan's book,"This book just wasn't well organized or clear. It doesn't offer concise strategies or easy-to-understand/implement strategies. It spends too much time going over ""warm-ups"" and not enough time going over acutal LSAT questions."
4,Pretty good guide,"This is a good book that will prepare you for the LSATs. It goes over all the sections (games, reading, logic etc.) and explains with examples and sample test questions.At the end of each section you can take an offical LSAT test. The book does not only guide you but also lets you adapt your own reading, problem solving techniques to maximize the use of the book.However, I do recommend putting in a lot of hours of studying. This book serves more as a guide, rather than a test tool.**Recommendation: Reading published journals on different topics, will get you used to the language and the format of writing.Good Luck!!!!"
2,An okay effort by some guys who aren't really the Guess Who,"I saw the website these guys had and was always curious about the album, as I had only rarely seen it in record stores. But in a Best Buy one day I picked up a copy for about $4 and took it home. The first thing that hits you is that this is not the music of the Guess Who of the '70's. This is only the original bass player, Jim Kale and the original drummer, Garry Peterson, and three newcomers who, while talented, in no way continue the sound, style or character of the previous band sound. Like when the Doobie Brothers went through a big change with Michael McDonald, this is on the same order. The songs are well produced and have their own special sound, but it does tend to be a little undistinctive as rock songs go. I found it listenable, but not for old Guess Who fans."
1,Yuck!,"Not sure if anyone is still considering buying this pile of *, but I bought it for 5.98 & overpaid by 5.97. This is an insult to Guess Who fans."
1,Generic junk,Hard to believe anybody could record pop music more soulless and meaningless and generic than Chicago. But this recording is it. Corporate pop never sounded so wretched. There isn't a single track that's worth playing more than once.
1,PURE CHUTZPA!,"How DARE they use the name of the Guess Who??? There is no resemblance. These guys should have been sued. This album has no heart, no depth, no creativity, no joy - absolutely nothing worthwhile. The people who like this album probably like American Idol. Bless their hearts."
1,The worst of the decade,"My pick for worst CD of the 90s: Lonely One, featuring Terry Hatty and a band that doesn't sound anything like the Guess Who. See ya in the bargain bin, boys!"
1,Pathetic,"In my opinion, if your an aging rocker that decides to relive your glorious past (and maybe cash in a little while your at it) by ""reforming"" your classic band without any of the ""key"" members that were always the real focal point of the band to begin with, you better make sure that you at least have some semblance of your ""classic"" sound intact. Maybe they still do live, but here Kale and Peterson don't, and this slickly produced mess is not worth even thinking about. Sorry Jim and Gary, you were great in the original band back then, BUT the two of you are NOT The Guess Who. Go back to the bars guys."
4,very helpful,Good information about curriculum mapping in an easy to use format with a number of useful templates and charts.
5,Wonderful pictures with an entertaining story line,"My almost 2 year old just LOVES this book. It is the first book he picked out by himself at the library, & he, of course, wants to read it over & over & over & over & over (well, you get the idea). The pictures are just perfect for the story & the story is just perfect if you're almost 2. It has lots of familar animals in it, & it is repetitive enough that he knows when to say ""No, no, Titus!"" (Which really makes your day if you're almost 2.) I wish you could see the pictures because they are really wonderful. I would recommend the book to anyone with small kids who like animals."
2,A great disappointment,"As someone who was actually expecting to receive a dvd which dealt with the Battle of Waterloo,I found the content of this disk infuriatingly shallow,unsatisfying,repetitive and full of inadequate flashbacks and psychological profiles.The description of the battle was dreadfully truncated and misleading.No mention of the rain and its effect for instance.Or the failure of Bonaparte's artillery barrage.There is not even a picture of the actual battlefield as it is today.Quite a lot of it survives.I know.I've been there.Be warned,if you want to know about the battle or the men involved there are plenty of books and Sergei Bondarchuk's film of'WATERLOO'."
2,Much More than One Battle,"This documentary is entirely reenactments, but they are done better than what History Channel usually comes up with (sloppily). The many historians interviewed are diverse in terms of nationality and gender. I'm not quite sure why National Geographic is covering this, rather than something more scientific.This work presents itself as discussing one last battle. However, it swings back and forth from Napoleon's exile to many times in his earlier years. It's comprehensible but people who like their history linear may be frustrated.The work is much longer than your average high school class period, so I can't imagine this being shown to high school students. Still, history buffs may really enjoy this."
3,It's a graduate dissertation.,"It's a graduate dissertation, and it reads like one. It's very dense. There is a short description of each author's interpretation of the passage, and whether they accept the narrow interpretation (that 'the least' applies only to Christians) or to a wider interpretation (that 'the least' is the whole world). It is exhaustive. The last section is a summary and analysis of the previous section. It is not an easy read, but it is a valuable contribution to Biblical studies."
4,Looking for reinforcements to the 7 Habits? This is it.,Quick reinforcement for the 7 Habits. No one teaches 7Habits like Stephen Covey and this is all Stephen Covey. I loved that this was affordable and short and to the point.
1,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Foundational Principles,"We found it to be boring and dry, like a college lecture.Although it made some good points, it didn't hold ourattention well and we never finished watching it.We thought it would make a good sleep aid."
2,Neither fish nor fowl,"This DVD was a disappointment to me. The instructor skips over the important parts how these various artists create melodic rock solos and wastes a bunch of time on playing solos ""in the style of,"" then goes into a ""put this finger on this fret, then put that finger on that fret, then put this finger on that fret"" kind of instruction on how to play the solos he just played for you. While mildly interesting, it doesn't go too far in getting across to you WHY he (and the artists he's emulating) put their fingers on the abovementioned frets.If you apply yourself, you'll learn to play the solos he shows you, which sound vaguely like Gary Moore, David Gilmour and Steve Lukather solos, but good luck creating your own Moore-, Gilmour- and Lukather-like solos. Or your own solos, period. And isn't that why we study these people and their approaches to guitar playing? To improve our own phrasing, note choice, etc.?"
3,Not for Cats,"I purchased this item for use with my cats. I found it to be disappointing for cats, but I believe it would be fine for small dogs. It has a ""seatbelt"" inside and is comfortable to wear. My pets just kept climbing out and sitting on the bag as if it was a sling."
4,Nice Tote.,"The main reason I chose this bag was for my 17"" laptop and I wanted a tote type bag rather than a briefcase style. It was the only one from the descriptions that I thought I could safely purchase to fit a larger laptop. It's a very nice looking bag but the padded sleeve intended for the laptop does not fit my 17"" laptop very well (too small). I am still happy with the tote but did give it 4 stars instead of 5 only for this reason. The bag itself it still functional for carrying my laptop, it's just not as secure."
3,to small,"the bag was ok. The material seemed a little low quality as compaired to the product description and the dims on the site and some of the reviews lead me to beleive that the bag would work for my laptop however when i received the bad the laptop in no way would safely fit. the return process with this company is annoying. you have to email them and once they decide you have a good enough reason to return the item (they dont let you explain you must choose from their completely unrelated reasons) which took a few emails for my reason to ""qualify"". you ship it back and are charged a ""restocking fee""."
4,Excellent product and quality,"Excellent bag, better to see it instead of look a picture. It`s big, so be sure to choose the appropriate size for your PC."
5,ANOTHER GREAT CD BY JAMES HALL,"JAMES HALL AND WORSHIP & PRAISE IS AWESOME. THIS CD IS AWESOME. WHEN I SAW THE CD IN THE STORE I BOUGHT RIGHT THEN AND THERE. THIS CD IS AWESOME. EVERY SONG IS GOOD. I LOVE ALL OF THE SONG. ""HAPPY ARE WE"" IS TH BEST SONG AND THE BEST SONG TO END THIS CD. JUST LISTEN TO THE WORD YOU WILL BE AMAZED. THE BAND IS HOT ON THIS ONE. JAMES HALL MADE HISTORY WITH THIS CD. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS, YOU NEED TO GET IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"
5,This has to be the best one out of the whole catalogue!!!,"I don't most lethargic listeners will not agree, but those who know what great gospel music sounds like will...James Hall & Melvin Crispell are musical geniuses!! And this album most definetly proves it...From the title track to Happy are We...it's just full of great music and killer vocals. AND, unlike most gospel music today...YOU KNOW IT'S BIBLE!!! You don't have to figure out who or what they're talkin about, IT'S JESUS ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!! So I suggest you get this album ASAP!!!"
4,learn some spanish,Spicy Hot Colors is a picture book teaching the names of colors in Spanish. Each color is given a full page spread. The name of the color is mentioned in English and then the spanish word is listed as well. In the back there is a vocabulary list for words that kids might not know the meanings of. Also is a helpful pronunciation guide for the Spanish words that are listed in the book.The illustrations were bright and bold. They went well with the text.I would recommend this book to educators who are teaching basic Spanish. The book was very helpful in home school while learning the names of colors in Spanish
3,"Great idea, needs revision","This book seemed exactly what I was looking for, as I put together detailed dietary advice for people with a TCM diagnosis at my clinic. However, I have found so many typos and confliciting items, that I have to check the info against other texts. Not as thorough as I would have liked, and for the price the amount of mistakes is a little frustrating. I do use it quite often though, along, with Healing with Whole Food and a few others."
4,Gets me going,"I liked the Blast Off Belly Fat that I wanted to try others first before buying. The didn't have this one at the library but from the reviews, I went ahead and purchased it. Glad I did. I always wanted to do Kick boxing but knew I couldn't last and wasn't sure if I was coordinated enough. This gave me a quick workout plus let me know what to expect when I'm ready for a cardio kickboxing class."
5,5 Day Get Fit Mix,This is a great addition to a library of fitness DVDs. It is a good way to add variety to home workout routines. Being able to exercise in small snippets is an added bonus when there never seems to be enough time to devote to 30 or 60 minutes exercise programs.
4,Best So Far,"So far this is the best 10 MInute Solution DVD that I've tried. I caution users who are new to yoga and/or kick-boxing to be careful, as I don't think her instructions in those segments are the clearest. But other than that, these workouts are fairly easy to follow, target the areas intended, and are not deathly dull."
5,Great mix,"This is one of the best videos I've bought. The movements in each section are very effective and although the sections are short, you know you have worked out. This is definitely a favorite!!"
4,10 min workout,It has a little bit of everything so you don't get bored..you can change it up daily..and it's easy to follow
3,"Good enough, but...","I have to be in the mood to workout to Amy Bento. She's a little too cutesy, which translates to her moves as well. The intervals, sculpt, and ab workouts are all very good, and her moves are rather innovative, but there's something about her that... Well, let's just say I can only take her in small doses. And watch out with the kickboxing. If you're into REAL hardcore kickboxing, this will be a huge disappointment. I didn't end up sweating very much, and it was more frustrating than anything else. She tries too hard to incorporate everything in such a short period of time that it would make followers, even those who are intermediate or advanced, susceptible to overexertion and even injury."
2,Not challenging enough for me,"I love the 10 minute solution series because it fits perfectly into my day. I love that I can pick and choose which workouts to do and that every day is different. I have a whole collection, and since the old ones weren't making me sweat anymore, I went out looking for some new ones. This one looked good and I liked the idea that it had a 'power yoga' workout. I LOVE yoga and needed something that challenged me more.I don't like this DVD because it doesn't challenge me. Some of the workouts I get a good sweat worked up, but the power yoga is a very simple routine that I could do in my sleep. I think this is probably a great routine for someone who is a beginner and wants a simple work out. It just wasn't right for me."
2,Not for me,"I had the10 Minute Solution - Target Toning for Beginnersand really love it. I thought I would add another 10 minute Solution to my routine just for some variety so I ordered the10 Minute Solution: 5 Day Get Fit Mix. The10 Minute Solution: 5 Day Get Fit Mixis truly not for me. The pace was too fast and the instructor, Amy Bento just adds moves as though everyone should already know the routine. I found her to be annoying and a little too hyped up for my taste."
4,classic cash,"johnny cash delivers a fine performance,i was 9 yrs old when he performed at madison square,but i remember his tv show, i bought the c.d.and listened to it from beginning to enda variety of country songs easy to listen to,and a welcome addition to your collection"
1,Don't purchase if you want to play on a computer,"This CD is ""copy controlled"", though that fact is not listed in the product details. It won't play on my system (an mp3 media center).The music may be fantastic, but I'm returning to get a different Piaf CD."
4,Falling for Rachel,"I read all the Staislaskis Books, they were kind of like popcorn. Once you start...cute books, and Nora Roberts always does the family books wonderfully."
4,Great book even as a re-release,"Thought all the books in this series were good, even though they were re-releases, I had not read them prior to this. I understand alot of people were upset by the revamping and re-releasing but honestly all of the new Nora Roberts book have the NR seal on them stating when they are a ""never before released"" title so it's pretty easy to tell when it's a new book or not. Thought the content held up to the time difference pretty well, would recommend."
3,Good Read,"Third of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded and gorgeous Ukranian-American family.The author does her usual great job in creating characters that I care about; I was invested in their HEA. And I loved the bits with her family and wished for more.However, this book probably would have worked better for me if the troubled brother was 15, even 17, not 19 years old. Also, the brief bits about gangs read more like Gang Light and occasionally made me wince. Minor issues, really.I had a good time and am looking forward to #4."
4,Fantastic!,"A heartwarming story, as we expect from Nora Roberts. Can't wait to read Alex and Nick's stories! Read this book!"
2,A Different Opinion,"I bought this book because of the good reviews it had gotten but had a different opinion upon reading it myself. As a new agent I read this book prepared to take notes and put markers on pages to come back to for further review. I finished the book with no notes and only 1 paged marked (gave good tips on what to ask a broker when interviewing with them for a position). Other than that I couldn't gather any useful information from the book that I could actually put to use. I found ""How to List and Sell Real Estate"" by Danielle Kenneday and ""How to Become a Power Agent"" by Darryl Davis to have much more useful information."
3,NOT for Beginners!,"I have read a pretty good portion of this book, but I just can't continue.My task at work is to learn about SNMP and start monitoring our equipment. This is a simple task that should be fairly straightforward. Unfortunately, I haven't found any two resources that can even agree on the definition of a MIB. Not even this book, one that's dedicated to MIBs, has helped me out.If you're looking for a good beginner's guide, don't waste your money on this book. If you don't know where to begin to compile MIBs, don't buy this book. Unless you deeply understand SNMP and are to the point where you feel you have to write MIBs, don't buy this book. You'll be sadly disappointed.I'm sure this is a wonderful book for the right audience, and I respect the authors for their technical abilities. My problem is not with the book, but with the way the book is marketed within the SNMP community."
5,Excellent reference for MIB developers and MIB experts-to-be,"This book is primarily intended for MIB developers. It teaches you MIB structure and syntax thoroughly enough that you could then author your own MIB. A secondary audience is people who need to be able to **truly** understand the behavior of a managed device-accomplished by reading the device MIB. Learning MIB syntax allows you to read vendor MIB files that accompany your routers, etc. This is the only book of its kind I've ever seen. Highly recommended."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this book based on information provided by the reviews here. To be honest, this book is outdated, confusing, and probably a sales pitch for the so-called SMICng tool the authors had developed. I wish I could return the book and spend the money somewhere else."
4,WARNING! Limited version of MIB compiler software,"The SMICng MIB compiler version on the CD is the ""book"" version and is very limited in its options. Unfortunately the documentation in the book shows all the options for the unlimited ""Pro"" ($490) version! I was disappointed because the MIB compiler was the main reason I purchased the book!"
4,MIB designer's Paradise,"I recomend reading this book before you start designing a MIB.This book really helped me a lot to understand , design MIB. The book also comes with a MIB parser and a application which converts MIBs to HTML document."
2,This book did not help me much,"I disagree with most of the reviews on this book. I was tasked with writing a MIB and this book did not do much for me. For instance, the IMPORTS clause, standard in any MIB. The author only gave a brief defenition of what it is, no examples, no explination of WHY one imports something! A MIB you write will not compile or work without a proper IMPORT clause.Reading this book takes great effort. Not an easy reas at all and I have been working with SNMP for 5 years and am a Certified OpenView Consultant, and have been for 3 years. There are part of this book that are helpful, but if you are going to be writing a MIB for the first time do not count on this book to help you get it done. Try Total SNMP, which gived a better breakdown and look at some of the MIBs already out there like the UPS MIB."
5,DYNAMIC RESEARCH AND SCHOLARSHIP,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK, IT UNFOLDS THE TRUE HISTORY OF AFRICAN PEOPLE. IT DEALS WITH THE MULTITUDE OF DISTORTION AND HOW AFRICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT OF HISTORY. CAUSE OF SLAVERY, RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMIST PROPAGANDA. HE DEALS WITH ETHIOPIA AND THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION, SHOWING HOW THE FIRST HUMAN BEING ERECTED FROM AFRICA. SO IF AFRICA GAVE BIRTH TO MANKIND THEN IT IS LOGICAL TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT AFRICA GAVE BIRTH TO CIVILIZATION. HE TALKS ABOUT ETHIOPIA, ANCIENT EGYPT, AND NUBIA, GHANA, MALI, SONGHAY, MONOMOTOPA, AND ECT. HE SYSTEMATICAL SHOWS HOW AFRICANS EVEN ENGAGED IN SEA VOYAGES WITH AMPLE PROOF AND EVIDENCE. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT, OBJECTIVE AND WELL ROUNDED BOOK."
4,Very insightful,"This book reminds us that no one goes through life easily. We all have issues to overcome - whether they are emotional, physical, financial or concerning relationships. It gives a positive Jewish perspective on how to overcome theses problems."
4,"Excellent , just excellent","Two thumbs up for this excellent book. Rebbetzin Jungreis did it again. As its predecessor ""The Committed Life"", this edifying book leads you through many real life issues and the way Judaism helps you handling them. It is written by a seasoned character who has already worked wonders in the outreach world. I would say this reading could be profitable to both Jews and non Jews."
2,A Disappointing Exposition,I thought I was going to receive an application of Torah to a wide range life's challenges.What I got was a culturally Jewish autobiography.
4,"Good, but not perfect","This a nice versatile bag. It's very light in weight and is compact. I use it for compact interchangeable lenses (Olympus 4/3 and micro 4/3).The foam padding is soft and provides only modest protection. The clip is useful to hang a small lens on a belt.Annoyingly, the pull string is an elastic cord, which I find can make the lens spring out of my hands if it catches on the case as I remove it. I've dropped a lens twice because of this darned elastic.The bag comes in ""small"" ""medium"" and ""large"" sizes. However these are misnomers, as all 3 have the same diameter, about 3 inches (about 4 inches flat)! They should be called ""short"" ""medium"" and ""long"". The large one is therefore not suitable for cameras or flashguns. For such things, get the ""X-Large"" size which is significantly wider, about 7 inches wide (when flat), about 5 inches circular diameter, and 9 inches long.Even the ""small"" one is plenty long enough for my 4 1/4 inch long compact (four-thirds) telephoto lens."
3,Lens pouch,"I like the fabric and the draw string on this pouch, fits my lens and meets my requirements. I recommend this product."
5,Zing medium lens pouch,What more can you ask? It's a well constructed pouch for lenses and other accessories. The draw string with locking clip is very handy too. Best lens pouch on the market with enough room on sides and depth for an 18-200mm Sigma lens.
4,Good for holding Arca Swiss Monoball B1,"- Cheap price- perfect size to hold Arca Swiss Monoball B1 ballhead or a similar sized item- does not provide 100% protection in case of drops- quality build and workmanship; nice neoprene material which is thick enough to provide some measure of protection- pullstring works- little clip seems convenient- can do without the big ""zing"" logo tag; can maybe catch on things if hiking and hanging off a belt clip or bag"
5,Awesome Lens Bag,I recently bought this as a lens bag and it is awesome. I put my Tokina 12-24mm wide angle in it and it fit perfectly. I may post some photos soon so future buyers can get a frame of reference in terms of size. It's hard to tell how big it is. I took a chance on it and I'm super glad I did!
4,Great Gift,"This is a great gift item for a little one. Since sometimes it's hard to buy gifts for nephews, nices, sons, etc. this is a great option and it's affordable."
1,Very disappointing,"I'm sorry, but this book is very poorly done. I was excited to get this book at first, but as of now, I'm going to look to replace it already. As a design challenge goes, this book is a failure, as the layout is not nearly as smooth as it could be. As a book that should be a handy reference, I should never have to struggle to figure out how to find the color I want. The layout just isn't thought out. And the way they've broken down the colors leaves so much room for error and omission. I'm sorry, but I don't work in just 10% color increments. I fail to understand the logic behind some combos being broken down in 10% increments and others in 5% increments. And why do none of the combos go higher than 60% black? I realize that including every color combo would make this book massive (though extremely worthwhile), but why not at least provide every 5% increment?"
2,Confusing!,"The color combinations are very comprehensive. However, I found the methodology used in organizing the color grids extremely confusing, and not very practical. I purchased this book to replace a well-used process color manual given to me by a printer 15 years ago. I'm disappointed, as I had high hopes from the description."
5,Very Helpful and clear!!,"I just got this book last friday and it is better than I expected! I am now learning how to use Illustrator and photoshop and it is very helpful to see the colors how are they going to look in the paper so you don`t doubt it, also I mean you can make more than 24,000 mixes what more do you want??.If you are a designer or like me learning to use adobe creative suite or anyother programs that uses CMYK colors this is it do not hesitate buying this, it can be a good member to your book collection, cause it goes straight to the point colors!!BUY THIS"
3,There are better ones,"I bought this book beacuse I tend to make a design and when I print it the colors don't match the ones I saw in the computer. I think the book is really helpful to really land on the color you want, but there are better books that can give you this and at the same time give you color theory and psicology for relatively the same price."
4,Haven't yet used this but,"Haven't yet used this book, but it looks as if it will be a very useful tool in choosing colours for printed layouts and knowing that what I choose will be what gets printed."
1,"Process Color Manual, 24,000 CMYK Combinations for Design, P",This book has no color theory whatsoever. What a waste of money!
4,Excellent find,"I was looking for a color book that I could use to consistently translate the color that was going to print from what I see on the computer. The Pantone sets, while awesome, are very expensive! I think this is a good substitute for that especially if you are a home designer and need a more inexpensive route. The book pretty much just has 1-4 color mixes and thats it, don't expect much reading."
4,Process Color Manual,Buy this. Discover what you have been missing on this exceptionally complicated subject.Learn how to match the use of color(s) to your project.Take your usage of color to a level well beyond your experience with the easy to understand non-techno language.Excellent investment.
3,Not as useful as I hoped,"The book provides a lot of colors, ya! For a more useful tool, choose a book featuring color combinations. Try ""Color Index"" by Jim Krause."
5,Mass Choirs :),"Im glad to see that DFW is still at it! Today, Prasie teams sound awesome! But there is something about a choir that just brings memto tear at times :') Yay for DFW! That first song is sick!"
5,Great for a toddler!,"My toddlers love to catch and throw this slightly smaller version of a football. And since it's rubber, not foam, our dog doesn't try to destroy it!"
2,Worst Java Book,This is the worst Java book that I ever had. Even for technical managers this doesn't do any good.I sold this book for $3.00 to a used book shop.
3,Boy's Own Java,"It's out of date, but captures the spirit of early java, and is a good distraction from the textbooks."
2,Dissapointed!!!,Not happy with the quality of the fabric. The flag looks pretty but feels fragile to the touch. Not worth the money!!!
4,"Cute, but not great for outside","I bought this for my little male dog to have a 'pee target' outside. I had to weight it down by filling the bottom with rocks. Also the lid is not snug and blows off all the time. I tried to tape a bags of rocks to the top, but they always fall off. I may glue the top on, but would like to find another way to secure it if possible. Other than those issues, it is quite cute and everyone who sees it thinks it great."
5,Awesome toy / storage box,"This thing is so cool! I bought it for my 3 year old that has an obsession with fire hydrants and fire trucks. He always wants to run over and touch each fire hydrant he spots. Now he's got one in his own room. Perfect for storing small toys like hot wheels cars, blocks, trains, etc... Or I bet it would be good for it's original manufactured purpose... holding doggie treats."
2,cheaply made,"I purchased this for my dog run so I guess i shouldn't complain, but really in my opinion the cost is not worth how cheaply it's made!"
3,Sound The Alarm,"The first project from B. Chase Williams and the Shabach Choir is full of energetic, heart felt, and scripture filled songs that are accompanied by grooves, slow ballads(worship), and rythymic praise from the ""band"". These compilation of songs are sure to take you from praise, then to worship. ""Anoint Me Lord""is just simply a song that lets the world know it is through the anointing of God, that we are able to minister the Gospel through song. Enjoy this C.D. as B.Chase Williams and the Shabach Choir ""Take A Trip""."
4,A Les & Rosie SHOULD HAVE !!,"The Brown Band & Ms. Clooney go way back to the early 16""transcription days. While never doing studio sessions despite the fact both were with Columbia for some time, this CD comes off quite well. There is a noteable lack of any recording infohere, but as a Brown historian & collector I can tell you this set was done Mid-sixties to 70. The MONO sound is very good, except for track 1 which sounds like it was recorded in a tub!With the recent demise of BOTH ARTISTS, it's worth having...."
1,Glad I didn't spend MY money on it...,"My son received this book as a gift for his first birthday. I thought he'd like the touch and feel aspect, but it doesn't hold his interest, which is fine by me because I cringe every time I read it.""Rainforest"" is not a hyphenated word.Every page beings ""In the ooey gooey rain forest..."" Ooey gooey?? Do we want our kids to think rainforests are gross?The page on amphibians mentions a tree frog with suction pad toes, but none are pictured.The page about birds talks about the hummingbird's two eggs, but three eggs are pictured.The ""insect"" page talks about spiders.Rainforest animals that would never be found together in the wild because they are from completely different parts of the world are pictured peacefully coexisting.This is the only Baby Einstein book we own, and I sure hope the others are way better than this one. Love their CDs, but this book is horrible."
3,Could be better,"My 18 month old daughter received this book for Christmas, and she loves to look at the pictures and feel the animals and plants. Unfortunately, only 4 days after receiving it, the feathers on the bird are coming off, and the anteater's sticky tongue is covered in the monkey's hair. Also, the text is a written in a way that does not interest my daughter. It is a little more complicated to follow than most of her books. I usually ad-lib on some pages. Overall, I would recommend the book. It is fun to look at and the tactile aspect is fun for little ones."
1,One of the worst books ever slapped together at the last minute,"It's pretty obvious the designer and the writer didn't talk to each other before this book went into production. Read about two eggs, see three eggs. Read about spiders, which are suddenly insects. Read about a frog, see some red plant that my baby loves to touch---too bad I can't tell him what it is, because the copy never mentions it. Honestly, I find this book simply horrible. I refuse to read the idiotic copy aloud anyway---""ooey gooey,"" my eye. And what is the deal with that Jane character....some bowlegged monkey girl who explores this ridiculous rainforest (not rain-forest, thank you very much). I hate her, and I hate the book! Boooo!"
4,clearly understood,"I am not new to validation having worked in a highly regulated industry for several years. And just reciently, I found the need to upgrade current systems in my engineering business.I used this handbook, and I am happy to say that Mr. Goldman covers the subject very well and is so complete that after reading it, anyone can create a workable system without using another source. The book is clearly written and is easy to understand."
1,Disappointed,Horrible repetitive heading style and sleep-inducing writing style led to quick frustration. The author makes computer validation as exciting as a baloney sandwich on white bread.I gave up trying to read this book and hope to find one that presents the material in a better fashion
4,very informative,This is a great reference book for people in the pharmaceutical industry who need to know the rules for properly replacing a computer system and documenting the procedures that need to be followed in order to meet due diligence and compliance regulations. Each chapter addresses a different aspect of the process.
5,"Readable, exciting philosophy book.","This is one of those books that truly address the kind of big questions that bring people to philosophy before they get lost in arcane aspects of the field, and does so beautifully. It offers the added service of tying the questions existentialism asks and tries to answer to existentialism's predecessors in philosophy. It does so in a clear writing style and with a sense of passion about the subject. It's a pretty quick read, unless you choose to linger over it, which isn't a bad idea."
1,It is not an introduction,"I just wanted to learn about existentialism. As the name suggested ""an introduction"", it is not for beginners. The language is more acedemic and hard to understand. For sure it was a waste of money for a biginner like myself."
4,Good Protection,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift (off his Wishlist). Neither of us regrets the purchase.I'm bad with brand names and recall the type of SLR camera he has, but I know it is NOT a Canon. This cover fits his camera and lens well and has kept them protected no matter where they get left around the house or when we take them on hiking trips.I agree with the other reviewers that the design is NOT optimized for the resulting target user. I used to design similar sewn products and think that more effort should have gone into the design based on end use/users. But of course, more time = more money. I'll likely make some modifications for carrying outside of a pack and quicker access as my husband and I pin-point our grievances."
2,Poor choice for Nikon D90 with 18-200 or 70-300,"I bought this for my Nikon D90 with the Nikon 18-200 and 70-300 lenses. Although the description of the case states that it will fit a lens up to 7 inches, the case will not close with the 70-300 zoom. (This lens measures about 6 inches in its fully retracted position.) It does close with the 18-200. The ""snout"" of the case is rather narrow and will not fit over the Nikon-supplied hood (carried in the reversed position) for either lens. Because the 18-200 and, to a lesser extent, the 70-300 are prone to flare in some conditions, this is a serious issue.The case appears to be a clever idea that should offer meaningful protection for a small sized DSLR with a short zoom. However, it is a poor choice for a D90 with two of Nikon's most popular lenses. Ratings reflect the case with the Nikon D90 and the 18-200 and 70-300 VR zooms."
3,hard to put on camera,"I have not acctually taken my camera out in incelment conditions, so I can't write regarding the effectiveness of the camera cover. However, I have put on/ taken off the cover several times and the process of putting the cover back on the camera is slow and difficult. I could see this cover becoming a source of frusturation if a photographer takes the time to put the camera away after each shot. Knowing what I know now, I don't know if I would have bought the cover"
2,These are great.,"Not the ""thermal"" feel it's claiming. Not terrible socks, but it's more like a towel texture inside. I probably will not buy these again."
4,Very attractive book for guitarist that are Hetfield fans,"This series of books (there is one for Hammet too) are beautifully designed and layed out, with text, pictures and tablature. I can't really comment much on the content as I bought this one as a present for my brother, who is a good guitarist and Metallica fan, who prefers Hetfield's playing solid rhythm & lead over Hammets widdling(although not a fan myself and not adverse to ""widdling"", I am inclined to agree). He liked the present. I hope they grow this series in the future (Santana, Jimmy Page, Brian Robertson, Scott Gorham, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Duanne Alman, Jimi Hendrix, Robert Johnson, SRV, Peter Green, BB King,...)."
5,A very unusual and interesting collection,"I have this on very scratchy old vinyl that a co-worker gave me several years back, and I love it. I intend to buy this CD. 25 minutes to go is absolutely hilarious even though it's the story of a very worried man counting down the minutes 'til his hanging. Johnny pulls it off with a mixture of hysteria and humor. The Streets of Laredo, Boot Hill, The Blizzard are all great songs - really miniature human interest stories. I also love the Shifting Whispering Sands. There is poetry besides singing on this CD. It is very different, very unusual and quite excellent. I recommend it!"
3,Searching for Ballads of the Old West,"Do you enjoy scavenger hunts? Perhaps this odd CD is your cup o'tea; it's Johnny Cash all right, the old songs just as they were when new, all you have to do is figure out which cut is which. The listing on the insert has little relevance to the final disc. The songs are all there, just not in the order indicated. It is fun to hear these old classic Cash tunes, but the problem is they really do sound just the same; the remastering leaves a lot to be desired."
3,For die hard fans only,"I can't sleep knowing there is a Johnny Cash album out there I don't have (Greatest Hits and Tributes excluded), which is why I bought this days after it's resissue, but I know a mediocre album when I hear one. Actually, this would be an awesome album if it weren't a double album. There's a lot of filler in between the good stuff. And the good stuff I'd heard before(except Sam Hall). If you don't own many Cash albums, don't get this one yet. But if you have a lot of his stuff, then get it if only to support the reissue process (currently I'm holding my breath for Hello I'm Johnny Cash)."
4,One of Johnny's early concept albums,"Originally issued as a double-LP set, this sort-of concept album doesn't really hold together as a cohesive whole, but there are several songs that stand out, where Johnny's heart does seem to be in it. On the flip side, some of the more disjointed songs, like the manic, wigged-out, amphetamine-laced, hootin' & hollerin' version of ""Sam Hall,"" seem to have finally found their audience in this day and age of sloppy cowcore alt.country. A mixed bag, but the Johnny Cash faithful will be pleased with the new CD reissue."
3,"It is a concise book, a good starter for the lens practice.",This was the first book I read about contact lenses. I can say it is a very handy book for starting lens practice and gives you the the essentials about the topic. It also has a good supplement of patient education . Missing things are lack of clinical examples which probably would make the book heavier and more technical details for the interested.
2,not the best zing cover?,"I have a friend who got the one with velcro straps that go around the lens and i actually think it is better as it allows for tighter protection. if you don't have a big lens, the pouch is a bit loose and sand/dust... could go in :-("
3,Not bad for the price,"I've owned this watch for 2.5 years and have worn it nearly every day. A perfectly fine watch. Over this length of time and level of use, the black wears off certain parts of the bracelet to expose the stainless. The case is NOT stainless, it is probably some sort of brass. The areas that have worn off on the case are a brown color; these are all on the bottom facing the wrist, and no one sees the brown. The crystal is scratchproof enough to have no major scratches after this length of time! The bracelet has mechanically held up well. Keeps good time, stylish, no problems. Just got a new watch, and I put a blue genuine shark skin strap on this guy, to give it new life."
4,Insightful and informative,"Budoka attracted to the hoary philosophical/metphysical roots of karate-do will enjoy this book, which should be rad with the author's ""Barefoot Zen""."
5,I'm not a history buff and yet...,"...this book captivated my attention. Very clearly and well written, Flood takes you almost step by step from Hitler's early years as a floundering nobody to the flourishing of what became the Nazi party under his rule. Be advised that this is as far as the timeline goes. The historical context is thoroughly discussed, a necessity considering that the rise of a man such as Hitler happened as a reaction to the political and cultural and social stagnation that occured in Germany after WWI."
5,Wonderful world of the weird,Great book to spend a few minutes with now and then. It proves beyond doubt that of all the species on our planet we are the most odd.
3,Recipies a bit complicated for college kids,"I bought this for a friend whose daughter is leaving for college soon. She's been complaining she's going to starve because she doesn't know how to cook. After reviewing it, I decided not to give it to her. I think most of the recipes are just too complicated for the typical college student, and some of the ingredients are not easily found in a small college town. I'll keep searching for another one."
2,Too basic,"this cook book was extremely basic. It seems to be made for someone who has no idea what to do in a kitchen. So i you don't know how to hard boil and egg then this book would be really helpful. however, I had hoped for more complex recipes. I do like how the recipes have calorie counts."
2,"The Healthy College Cookbook: Quick, Cheap, Easy","I bought this book online without seeing it based on the online reviews. However, I was disappointed with the recipes, most of which did not seem very appealing."
1,WARNING: Do Not Buy,"I received this book as a gift and since I love cooking, I immediately began using recipes from it. BIG mistake. This is one of the worst cookbooks I have ever used. First, it assumes that college students eat tiny portions; for example, the chili recipe is listed as ""serves 6"" but it was barely enough food for me and two friends. Also, several of the recipes turned out terribly despite my efforts to follow the instructions exactly. Tiny portions and absurd instructions make this a terrible cookbook for college students or anyone. NOT recommended."
3,Average Cook Book,"This book was interesting to peruse. The authors are obviously creative and put a lot of work into the book. If you are a complete novice in cooking, this book serves as an excellent introduction. However, if you have had any experience cooking, this book may not be as useful to you as others. Good luck in your cooking quest."
2,Way too simple.,"The recipes in this book were far too simple. Unless you are extremely new to food preparation, it is an unhelpful book. Recipes include simple things such as how to make a sandwich, dips, and a bagel with cream cheese."
5,Great book for those who like simple cooking,"I am not a bad cook but usually do not find it a pleasure to whip something up in the kitchen. ""The Healthy College Cookbook: Quick, Cheap, Easy"" delivers in that it serves up recipes with simple ingredients and easy instructions. I have tried many of the recipes and have really liked them (the Beef Stroganoff is simple and delicious). This book is great for non-students who don't have time to cook. Highly recommended."
3,A little disappointing,I bought this book because it had received decent reviews and being a household of 1; I had hoped that I could make some quick meals.I am not a experienced chef by any means but don't consider myself a true beginner. I know how to make some basics and figured this may give me some fresh ideas.It seemed the ideas were TOO basic. And they didn't seem to have any fresh outlook on recipes.I wish I had invested in something I would read and use more often.
2,Disappointed,"I was definitely fooled by the title of this book; I thought it was supposed to be something designed specifically for university students. As a university student, I can tell you one thing: WE DO NOT HAVE TIME TO COOK!!!There are a lot of interesting recipes catering to a variety of tastes. However, the amount of time the preparations require just cannot fit into the average college student's schedule (at least not for a serious student). For example, the time it took me to prepare a supposedly simple Orange French Toast breakfast, eat, finish the dishes and clean up afterwards lasted easily over an hour. That's just way too much time for French toast.After jotting down a few recipes worth remembering for future use, I donated this to my local library."
2,Did anyone proof read this?,Maybe its just bad luck.. but the first two recipes i try turned out awful... there seem to be issues with the amounts of ingredients.. for a cream sauce..it told me to use 1.5 CUPS of flowers with 1.25 cups of milk... i guess i shouldn't have blindly followed the recipes.. so it was a big waste of time and ingredients.. and it came out with a big floury goo mess...most of the recipes seem pretty basic. it would be a good tool for learning i don't continue to find typos..
4,Good starter cookbook.,"I bought this cookbook for my son, and he and his roommates have tried quite a few of the recipes. They don't ask for unusual ingredients or a lot of cooking expertise, and most of the recipes can be made fairly quickly."
4,Very good for single people,"As someone that is single and knows my way around the kitchen pretty well, I found this cookbook to be very useful for single people. A lot of recipes/cookbooks out there are geared towards families. It's hard to find recipes that are single serve. Some of my favorite recipes included steamed cabbage, simple green beans, beef stir fry."
4,Good Cookbook for the basics,"This is a great cookbook for college students who need a few basic recipes. Though it would probally be the most benefical for students who live in apartments because several recipes require oven and other cooking aplliances. Define cooking terms, uses of cooking applainces, and herbs that help to add flavor to meals. Have many sections like vegetarian food, deserts, sauces,soups, etc. I have tried a few recipes and they came out pretty good. Easy to follow and helpful. I would recommend it though sdavanced cooks probally already know this stuff, but I found it really helpful."
3,"I Used It, College Grad. Didn't","I found this book in my boyfriends closet while we were packing to move. Apparently this book was given to him as a present when he was in Graduate School but never used it. So, I decided to take it and give it a try.The recipes were pretty simple to make and I must say, they were delicious and very creative. I am not sure though, if a college student would really go out of their way and try and make some of these.....You as a student would be finding and buying foods you would never think of before, which can add up the grocery bill. But if you love to cook then you will like this.I would say the major downfall is that this book contains NO pictures. I like having a picutre in front of me to give me an idea of what the outcome of the dish will look like when I am finished."
5,Cheaper than the food court (hopefully),"This is designed for a beginning cook and so, quite sensibly begins with some basic advice on stocking a kitchen with equipment and staples. Cooking terms are explained and safety information is also given.The recipes are clearly written (prep time is not given but it would be difficult for the authors to estimate how long it would take a beginning cook) and cover a nice range of difficulty and interests. I particularly liked that vegetarian recipes were included and that all recipes had nutrition information listed, both necessities for a (sometime) vegetarian who is usually on a diet.I bought this for my college student daughter in hopes of inspiring her to cook for herself, at least part of the time, instead of eating out. For others who are thinking about this as a gift for a student I would suggest adding some of the basic equipment or staples needed."
2,poor quality,"First of all, I like the design. I bought two sets of these during a gold box event. I thought at about $50 a set, a good deal. First, realise that the forks and spoons don't nest together or are even uniform. The bends of these utensils are not the same. Not all of the spoon lips were smooth or polished. The Quality control inspector should be fired. Back these sets go. I'm hoping this is not the quality Oneida is sinking to. I got better quality with a set of Crofton I bought at Auldi Foods for $20 for a 4 place setting. Now I wish I had bought a few more sets. If you care about quality, forget about these."
2,Not for pets over 15 lbs,"I bought this for our small dog that weighs 17 lbs since the description says it holds dogs up to 20 lbs. While the sling is made well, it does NOT comfortably fit our dog. I can get him in it but it is awkward to carry him. I would not have purchased this if I had known it really didn't hold what it promised."
3,too small,"This sling says it can hold a 15 lb dog. This is true, however, that is a big stretch. It is too small for my 15 lb dog to hang in comfortably. Not a great deal."
3,Nice bad but barely fitts my laptop,"The bag is very nice except i have to struggle to fit my laptop in it. If you have a smaller laptop it would be perfect but mine is just a little too big. Other than that, the bag itself is very nice!"
2,"Not introductory, not cohesive -- skip it","While this book is short and relatively well-written, it is entirely full of jargon and doesn't stay long enough on any one topic to fully develop it. The book assumes you already know the material, and I think doesn't really do a good job reviewing it, if you did. I am fine with the mathematics in it, which are not difficult, but this appears to be written for electrical engineers, who want a refresher, I guess. But he spends too much space introducing the basics, which an EE would already know. What audience is this book actually written for? Who knows?A much better unifying high-level cheap Dover book on waves, that actually hits the mark isPhysics of Waves; that book has much more content, is more deliberate, and isn't just confined to electromagnetic waves."
2,No physical intuition at all,"Deeply disappointing. I have a strong math background, and a modest physics one. I was hoping to learn some of the physics intuitively, and did not. It just isn't in here. Unclear in many places. All about wave coupling asnd how it affects power transmission."
2,Be careful!,"I feel like I was cheated. While researching travel guides, I found this one and when i clicked to buy it a window popped up saying: ""You can get it used for $4.95"". So I did it not realizing until I received the book in the mail that this was a 2002 edition! What good is that in a travel guide? None at all."
2,A Sonic Disappointment,"I remembered First Choice from their early '70s hit, ""Armed and Extremely Dangerous"", and wanted a collection that would present more of their girl group Philly sound. I was very disappointed with this CD. First, it was poorly remastered, much like those tinny-sounding discs that were common in the mid-1980s. Second, while the arrangements are filled with the strings and brass that the Philadelphia sound is known for, I found most of the vocals to be less than pleasant to listen to...even flat in some places. If you really want a compilation from First Choice, and can handle the vocals, I strongly suggest choosing one from a different label. Perhaps the vocals would sound more tolerable with better mastering."
1,Ultimate First Choice,"This is the CD if you need to catch up on one of the premier girl groups of the disco era------This has everything you need--The early hits (""Smarty Pants"", ""Armed & Extremely...""), The Disco Hits; (""Dr. Love"", ""Let No Man..."") and the underground extras (""Love & Happiness"", ""Breakaway"") and the remixes--->Tom Moulton's ""Dr.Love"" and Shep Pettibones'""Let No Man Put Asunder""The only nitpickin I would have here is the short radio versions of ""Double Cross"" and ""Breakaway""----but if you're just getting started this is a CD that will keep you involved for a few 24/7's!!!!!!!"
5,great music,Fast service. I'm enjoying the oldies. Thank you.I put them on my mp3 player.I can listen to them in the car. Love it.
3,great game - old system,"you can adjust the controller to give it more of an X-box 360 feel, but let's face it, its an older system and the 360 kills it. Still, this is the best hockey available for the Xbox. I still play it while on my stationary bike. (this and Fifa 07)"
3,"Good for ""On the Go""","I got this to go with my Nikon D90 DSLR with a nominal zoom lens. It is not a perfect fit, but it does the job well enough to earn a place in my backpack and camera bag. The Nikon D90 is a little too ""tall"" for this zing sling and the zoom lens is a little too fat to fit easily, but with a little stretch and tug it all works out just fine and I felt completely comfortable with the camera in my backpack being tossed around in a Land Rover or stuffed into the overhead bin or even in the back of my car awaiting my next adventure.I also use it as added protection in my Domke F-6 camera bag, which is a great bag but does not have padding on the sides. With this zing sling I can just toss it in the Domke bag and not worry about it."
3,Awkward and Difficult to Remove,"Great protection, but not very practical for serious photographers needingto access gear. If you're just storing for protection that is another matter.I sent mine back as I use m-rock topload and Mountainsmith lumbar packs.I bought this originally to take a trip over seas, but decided on a Crumpler typebag for easier access and lower visibility for thieves.If you need major protection of some sort this might work, but if you need accessI'd pass this up and do some more research."
3,"Good quality, a bit awkward","Bought this for my Canon 30D. I use a variety of lenses on it, but mostly a 50mm and a 28-75mm. I'll start by saying the package actually specifies that it's for a Canon Rebel, A-1 and AE-1. It's a snug fit on my camera body but definitely do-able. I don't see any way to ""slip"" the ring over the lens as other reviewers suggested without pushing too hard on the camera/lens. Thankfully the ring has velcro, so I'll definitely be using that instead. The color is also more navy than the vibrant blue in the photo, but that's fine. The padding is thick, the fit is snug and it will serve the purpose of protecting my camera while still allowing me to just throw it in my purse. However, I'll always have to use two hands to get my camera in/out of the bag, so it's not as convenient as I had hoped."
3,Believable,"An intriguing, if a bit surface-level, first-person description of what it's like to be a medium, with a casual but articulate voice sprinkled with comic relief asides. The accounts are interesting, but not any moreso than any decent true paranormal account book. I guess from an author who's described on the cover as being ""hailed as Britain's most accurate medium,"" I expected something a bit more... well... unbelievable. As I was reading this, I kept thinking of the Onion story, ""The Thinkable Happens to Local Man"": ""...""'I can believe what I just saw,' one witness told reporters. 'In all my years, I can honestly say I've seen many things like that. Who wouldn't have thought that this, or something very much like it, could happen?'""Still, this is a worthwhile addition to the collection of any psychic phenomena enthusiast, and would be a fun and fascinating read for any newcomer to the subject."
4,England's Famed Medium Answers Questions,"Gordon Smith is an English medium who cuts hair for a living, hailed as Britain's most accurate medium"" according to the Daily Mail. In this book he opens up his world of psychic impressions & has a breezy, familiar writing style that I found an enjoyable read.He covers alot of ground here: how mediums & psychics get their info, why spirits choose to communicate with us, the truth about ghosts & hauntings, out-of-body experiences, re-incarnation & past lives.If you're a fan of the ""what happens after death"" genre, this is a great addition to your library."
5,One of those albums...,"I've had this album for about 3 years now.. Although it feels now like a passing phase in Bally Sagoo's musical career, its the one hindi-pop album I have, and the only one I want.. The music is great, it HAS LYRICS! and is sung by a group of really talented people.. Only a couple of 'dance-floor' tracks at the end are worth missing.. This is one of those 'once in a lifetime' albums.. Go Get It!"
5,beatiful!,this cd is beautiful! (I'm writing this review cause I don't know how else to rate things so they influence the personalized reccomendations)
3,National Geographic..,"I guess I should have known - this doco being done by National Geographic.. The American accents, when talking about English history were alittle much for me. Content was good - offered up a few insights into the background of Henry 8th and his wives. Informative in an easy to understand style, lots of little known details & extra tidbitsI did enjoy :-)"
5,No issues,"I did not have any issues with this purchase. The product was as described and came quickly. The DVD works and is not scratched at all, the case is in excellent condition."
2,Henry VIII by Nat Geo,"To say the least, this was boring when compared to the Showtime series, The Tudors. It just did not have the production value and I stopped watching it before the end. Not recommended."
5,Henry VIII DVD,"DVD was in excellent condition, received very quickly. National Geographic always has very informative, interesting documentaries. Love the Tudor time period - Henry VIII and his family (ancestors, wives, descendents)are always an interesting subject matter."
2,Low on the erotica scale ....,"This is a two volume book, Dangerous Desires and Dark Desires..... Both stories have basically the same theme except that in 'Dangerous' our heroine is given the witchraft tools of symbols, candles and or course a drop cloth while in 'Dark' the horine find the other world through a haunted house and the obligatory horny ghosts ....Waht we do get in this book ... by the way .. it's big and it's heavy ... are two dumb little women who have lot's of sex and always wonder afetrwards why they enjoy it ...."
3,"Standard, uncomplicated romance...","This story centers around Carly, a single real estate agent and the handsome, wealthy client who walks into her office in search of a new home. What follows is a fairly simple girl meets boy, boy likes girl, girl reluctantly ends up liking boy, misunderstanding in the middle, finally typical romance ending.Still, Fern Michaels did this one well. I was interested enough that I read this book in one sitting. The characters were well drawn and interesting. She wrote well with the exception of a few small instances of shifting point of view from one person to another within the same scene. This book has a copyright date of 1987. In the last 21 years I'm sure Fern Michaels has probably perfected her craft so I might just consider reading another Fern Michaels story."
3,Fairly good,"This book was a little slower reading. I liked it, but it was not one of my favorite books of Fern Michaels."
2,Disliked Beyond Tomorrow,I am very disappointed with this Audio CD. It was boring and drawn out just to fill 5 c d 's. The narriator was flat and boring. It was hard to keep interested in the story. I have listened to all of Fern Michaels stories and have loved all of them except this one. I will not purchase any more c d 's by Fern Michaels unless they are read by Laural Merlington.
3,reprint,"I was looking for the NEW Fern Michaels book Beyond Tomorrow at my library only to find out it had previously been published in 1981. Not having read the ""new"" book, I wonder if she just updated the older version with the technology and other things we have in 2012."
3,happy enough,I rated this product with only three stars because it does not seem to hold my magazines very tightly. I used this for my double stack magazines for my sr9. The magazine are pretty fat and this just did not seem to provide enough retention to hold them securely enough (in my opinion anyway). It is very comfortable to wear though. My only real complaint is the retention on the mags. Other than that it is a great product. I have had it for a while and it seems to hold up fine and be made of quality durable materials. The magazine did not seem to rattle too much and were easy to draw for quick reloading. It is also very concealable. If there was only an adjustment screw to tighten or loosen accordingly this would be a 5 star product.
2,For P250 get something else,Doesn't hold my P250 mags securely which is a shame because this company makes great stuff. I have a fobus paddle holster which is awesome. This can work if you put some electrical tape or something inside to help hold the magazines more securely.
4,Great toy,My 5 y.o. son loves these but there are too many little toys to keep track of. I haven't figured out a way to keep it organized yet (possibly ziplock bags).
3,Not written for a child who has lost a parent,I got this book to read to my grandchildren who had just lost their 37 year old mother. It is a beautiful book but the interaction between Kate and her mother would have been too hurtful. I would like to see it written for children who had lost a mom or dad. The illustrations are beautiful. My granddaughter is six and can read otherwise I could have changed the wording for them. She loves to read and would have wanted it to read on her own. It would be too difficult for her.
3,Well done!,"A well thought-through story with soft illustrations. My only concern is whether this is the book to introduce a child to old age and dying. An alternative may be ""Something to Remember Me By"" by Susan Bosak. It's an extremely touching book with illustrations that make the story come alive. It a nice book for sharing, especially with a grandparent that is still alive and may be facing some life changes. A beautiful complement to Maria Shriver's book."
5,Nice Book,I bought this book for my son when we were experiencing death in our family. He was confused regarding death and what happens to them. This is a great way to explain it but leaving a good feeling afterwards.
5,Great Book,Great book for helping children understand death. Brings a little clarity to a very difficult subject to address with children.
4,A Timely Book,"I had heard of this book but had not read it. When my Mother passed away this year, I wanted to read the book and see if it would help explain the concept of heaven to my two grandchildren, ages 3 and 8. It was checked out at my public library, but I finally located a copy at a nearby mall. I was well pleased with the content and the illustrations were beautiful. At the same time I located this for my grandson, a friend of his in Cub Scouts lost his grandfather, so I ordered a copy for him. It was well written, and explained death of a loved one, heaven, and the question of ""why"" in a way that the children understood and were comfortable with. I am looking forward to her next book, which deals with ""special"" children."
3,conversation piece,"I purchased this book to read to my grandchildren so that we could discuss the passing of my husband, their grandfather."
3,What's Heaven,What's Heaven was not as good as I thought it would be. I bought it for a 4 year old who had just lost his mother. It wasn't as comforting as I felt it could have been.
4,"Sensitive, Helped an 8yr old whose brother had died.","As a nurse that has seen many people deal with death, I found this a good source of material for the family to discuss the loss of a family member. The parent that I gave this book to was very appreciative and read it with her 8yr old daughter."
2,"Distant and Removed, Very Disappointing!",The hype about this book is just that hype! There are better books available to discuss the loss of life but it seems when you are a famous person you can immediately rise to the top. I was truly disappointed in the story although the illustrations are very well done. I think the illustrator should receive the credit for any success this book attracts!
1,for New Age readers,"While it seems harmless and non-denominational, there are a few hard concepts to swallow in this book- especially the very pillers of religious faith.*To get to heaven you are to ""be good"" which is not a respected view point in any Christian faith.*""Everyone"" does not go to heaven.* The spirit of the dead is ""everywhere around us""* Animals go to animal heaven seperated from regular heaven by a white picket fence. (Animals in heaven is mentioned several times in this short book).Beautiful watercolor drawings, but New Age is my best opinion."
2,What's Heaven? is not based on Bible's teachings,"I was so surprised that with Maria Shriver's Catholic background that she leads her readers to believe that ""everyone who is good throughout their life will get to go to heaven."" Wrong! We are saved because God loved us so much and sent his son, Jesus, to die on the cross of our sins, thus, giving to those who believe in him eternal life. If we relied on ""being good"" no one could ever inherit eternal life. Even though I would like to think that my pet friends will be in heaven, the Bible does not address this. I was very disappointed in the book."
3,heaven for a child,It was ok but I was looking for a little more honest book with more knowledge on God for a child. The pictures were beautiful.
2,Needs better theology,"Having a godson who just lost his grandfather, I wanted to find a book on death for him. This book immediately came to mind due to the recent press on it. However, having now read it, I can't in good conscience give it to him. Although the book is sweet, well written and beautifully illustrated, it errs on one basic belief of all Christians. The book says if you are a good person on earth then you will go to heaven. The basis of Christianity is that it is not works (good deeds) that will ensure your place in heaven, but a belief that Jesus Christ died for your sins and rose from the dead. Hallelujah!"
1,A disappointment,"I first heard about this book when I saw Maria Shriver talk about it on the Oprah show. I was interested to discover that a celebrity had brought the topic of heaven into the public arena. When I went to the bookstore to read the book, I was incredibly disappointed. The book is shallow and a watered down version of what heaven is, as spelled out in the Bible. Although there are few books written for young children on the topic of heaven, I found that Kathleen Long Bostrom's book, WHAT ABOUT HEAVEN?, gives a solid explanation of what Christians believe about heaven, based on the biblical references which are included in the back of the book. I am sure that Maria Shriver meant well, but it is always a risk when celebrities think that they can write for children."
4,Night vision glasses help,"The amber colored, clip-on glasses do seem to improve my night vision. A bicyclist in all black clothing on a dark night seemed to leap into sight, which I don't think would have happened without the glasses. My only complaint: The glasses are very large."
3,Sophocles,"One of the best and most famous books in ancient history. A great book to read if you like tragedy, this book is a great read. It has all three stories which is great and you dont have to pay for each one seperately this way and is pretty cheap for its price."
5,must have for the Ester fan!,This is a must have if you are an Ester fan!The women of today have no idea what true beauty and class really is!Ester is like Grace Kelly in a class of her own.This is a great box set I have the first set as well- a must have if you are a fan of hers.Only wish the Duchess of Idaho was on this one as it wasn't on the first set either-wonderful movie they forgot!!!Enjoy I truely do!!!You won't be discouraged
2,Not The Best Of MGM Musicals,"A strange Esther Williams vehicle in that she doesn't seem to have that much screen time, and very little of it is spent in the water! The focus is more on Howard Keel, and he is in fine voice. Unfortunately, the songs he has to work with are completely forgettable. Nice Hawaii photography (even though the film is supposedly set in Tahiti). Pretty predictable story (granted, most stories behind most musicals are pretty predictable). In light of the better Esther Williams showcases (Neptune's Daughter, Million Dollar Mermaid) and the great MGM musicals, this entry, unfortunately, seems like a poor country cousin."
5,Easter Williams Vol 2,"Each of these movies were great. Color was beautiful. Story line varried so you didin't feel like you were watching the same movie, different charactors. Very goood."
5,Esther forever.,I already have the first volume of the Esther Williams DVD-box and was really looking forward having number two. Now it's playing on my DVD-player and both me and my wifelove to see these old films. It feels like time has stood still and it's really worth the cost.
2,bigest dissapointment in a very long time.......,"well if your expecting another prog metal masterpiece like ""back to times of splendor"" than ""dont go any further"" lol. i was completely discusted with this album when i heard it, and i could not belive this was the same band that put out ""back to times of splendor. first off the prog metal side is all gone. no more prog at all. and the songs are all short. now that would be fine with me if they were atleast good songs, but they all pretty much are crap. and also the singer sounds like crap through this whole album......i'd say there is about 4 songs at most that are good on this album. still not nearly as good as their debuit though. this album could be compared with rammstein type music. witch is really really sad...utter dissapointment...."
5,great game,"This is the first NBA game that I played and I love it. Here is what I have to say about the game.Great thingsThe best thing is all star weekend where you have all the events of real life all star weekend. You could play the all star game, 3 point shootout, slam dunk contest, and the rookie vs sophmore game.season mode is fun toYou should buy this game"
3,buying this game to play online? save your money,"bottem line. everyone who plays onine cheats. youll find your self winning in a game then in between quarters suddenly you will see a message like"" other player have terminated connection"" then you will get the loss and they will win. ive had games when ive been 20 points ahead and they pull there little cheat and I loss. my record now is 45 and 35. About 30 of those losses are from these nba live cheaters. E.a does nothing about it either. do your self a favor and pick another game."
2,Game is Gay,"Honestly, I am huge support of NBA2K8, however I am in Iraq right now so I have to subject myself to NBA live 08 on PSP. The mini games are fun, and I like the added 3 point contest and slam dunk, but the actual gameplay of the game is horrid. Anyone can take it all the way to the hole and lay it up and it's hard to stop. It's just not worth the money."
5,fantastic psp game,"I normally don't post reviews, but I thought that this game was good enough to warrant one. The graphics....well they're pretty good. Nothing AMAZING, but they're good to show to your friends/coworkers the capabilities of your psp.The gameplay is where this game truly shines. The buttons are great, and this game(on rookie) is easy for most beginners to pick up. The online is great, as well."
4,Watch out for the good and bad.,"This Japan exclusive CD single ""Let's Love"" is a great single. I like the song ""Living Without You"" on this CD. The Instrumental of the ""Let's Love"" song is great for all the karaoke people and whoever wants to listen to the music. ""like That"" is also another great song. It was also on the ""Here It Comes Again"" single. The bad thing about this CD is if that you can't create a back up CD so you don't damage your original. It has something called ""Copy Control CD"" on it. So for you people who make special CD's for your cars CD player on your way to work or a back up of your CDs so you don't damage the original, you're going to have to buy another expensive CD single to listen to them in your car or if you damage it. That's the reason for the 4 stars. You should buy this CD as a collectors item!! Great songs!!"
5,"The Complete Works of Flannery O""Connor",Flannery O'Connor is a gifted writer. Her short stories are jarring in that the characters are taken to the exteme. They are very effective tools to show the condition of the wounded souls who need grace and redemption.
5,Deserves The Adulation She Receives,"I recently started taking a writing course and have set out to read, in depth, the acknowledged American short story masters. So far I've gone through Carver, Hemingway, Cheever, and now O'Connor. Of the four, I'm most impressed with O'Connor, which is saying a lot! For my tastes, she has the perfect combination of interesting plot, deep characters, substantial themes, and literary chops (symbolism, metaphor, etc.). Her stories are a bit ""weird"" and also heavy on religious themes, so they may not appeal to everyone. But just for her sheer brilliance as a writer, everyone should read a few of her stories. I recommend Revelation, Good Country People, and Everything That Rises Must Converge."
5,a lovely book,"Oh yes! I adore her, and so do my mum and dad. They talk about her all of the time, and so I grew up with the prose ringing in my ears. I am so pleased to be reading her now."
2,Not the Best,"KMC makes quality quality chains. I bought a z510 2 years ago in orange and it has been the highest quality chain I have ever had the joy of riding. It is precision made. I would stay away from the lower end models. When it comes to bike parts like this, that 10 dollars will sacrifice pure build quality. I have snapped about 4 z410 chains on a couple of my bikes in the past 2 years. I was pretty hard on them by popping constant power wheelies but that will never happen with the z510. The lower z410 will serve a a great chain for a kids bike and it has a great purpose for that but do not buy this product expecting a reliable long lasting chain because it will blow out on you."
3,Color,"Just a warning to other buyers, the blue chain is far from the color of blue seen in the picture. It looks more turquoise than anything else, which was disappointing. Still, probably not a bad chain."
2,Bad idea to bargain shop....,"I regret bargain shopping for a bike chain. Within 1 week, the master link broke off. The links just feel cheap and using it w/o a master link causes the connecting links to lock up sometimes. Considering it is KMC, which is normally reputable, I am disappointed and a little scared to ride with it.Point of story: don't bargain shop for a chain! pay the extra money for an SRAM."
2,Not worth it,"Its light but it has broken twice on me in one week. Im not putting that thing back on my bike, not worth getting stuck somewhere to save a buck."
1,Beware!,"Within one week of installation masterlink broke, causing loss of pedaling ability. Also there were no instructions, and I had to use the park tool website for help with installation."
2,"colorful yes, useful, not really.","i made my own fixie, i used the chain but it broke on me a couple of times could be me but breaking twice on a ride really is annoying. the fact it comes with quick release option is nice though"
2,don't like z chains,"Lot of people seem to think they are ""the"" option for single speed bikes. One came standard on my fixed/free bike and at the bike shop if you tell them what kind of bike you have they try to push the z-chain on you and act like it's strange to get the thinner standard chains for 8 or 9 speeds. Well to hell with the fat heavy z chains I say! They're cheap as you can see with the broken chain experiences related here and they slow you down. Plus the standard size 3/32 chain fits in chainbreakers if you need to push in a pin rather than using the so-called master link. Buy a decent Shimano 9 speed chain for a couple dollars more than the Z. Just say no to the trendy fat painted chain"
4,Good bike chain for the money,"KMC makes some of the best bike Chains for the money, however you get what you pay for, this is a lower end chain, it stretches quite a bit, it's not pretty but it is functional for cruising around, BMX Racers and Freestyle riders know this chain is in no way made for them."
4,good chain,If you put out alot of torque(350ft/lbs) like I do you need this chain for a 1/8 set up. They also have a titanium nitride coated chain(kmc 710)
2,KMC bIke chain,This chain looks good and works fine but when it arrived it was out of the manufacturer box floating around in the amazon box and when I took it to my local bike shop to put on my new crank set it did not come with a master lock. They need to try and secure their product better in their box. Other than that great looking chain!
5,It's my stock chain... now in trendy white!!!,"Based on negative reviews, I was about to pass on getting a long-wanted white bike chain to match the rims and white accents on my Fuji Feather. I was also concerned I might be downgrading the nice chain that came with my bike. NOPE. Went to Fuji's website and lo and behold this IS my stock bike chain. I ride fast, hard, and regularly flip-flop between a 15t cog and 16t freewheel (this puts mega stress on chains). Never had an issue and don't plan on having one. I'm going to use my stock chain to lock down my Brooks saddle.Sorry guys, I have to chalk the bad reviews up to user error. If you can't assemble a chain or are clumsy with a chain brute, pay your LBS $5 to do it!Rant over, clicking ""add to cart"" now."
2,Broke after 4 months.,"Put this chain on my bike around 4 months ago and it broke. The outer plate on one of the links broke off of the pin. The only thing holding the chain together was one plate on the other side of the link. This isn't safe to ride on and luckily the chain didn't break while I was riding it. My bike is a fixed gear and I didn't have a break on my bike until recently so skid stops probably had a big effect on the chain, but it still shouldn't have done this.If you want to know if I remember correctly the only time I broke the chain was when I put a smaller chainring on my bike.This could be a good chain if you need a single speed chain and can't spend a lot of money (but 20 dollars isn't much more), but I won't be buying this chain again. I'd rather get a 20 dollar chain that will last me a lot longer and will only stretch, not break."
3,Good enough for average use,"I used these on beach cruisers before, and they worked fine for a long time. I put one on a single speed mountain bike, which sees heavy use, while pulling a loaded trailer (50lb). The chain stretched and derailed in a couple months. The teeth all seem fine, and I replaced it with a duplicate chain I had leftover from another bike. This chain is flexible from side to side. Good for coping with imperfect chain-line, but lets the chain spring or wiggle a lot, possibly leading to derailment."
2,open box,"my box that actually contained the chain was open and the chain was hanging out and unless it doesnt coming with it its missing the missing link to connect it together, its just two round ends and now i need to purchase a missing link."
4,Planets of the Core,"This is a high quality sourcebook from Wizards detailing about 25 worlds near the center of the star wars galaxy. Full color and with sections divided into PC and GM information, it is packed with plot hooks, enemies, allies, and art. Drawbacks include that it is not as useful for PC's other than fun reading and detailing their homeworlds. A personal peeve was that many monsters and locales are described but lack pictures to illustrate them. But that's probably hard to do for every monster and locale as so many are introduced over the book. Overall, a good product especially for new players who don't own any other planet guides from earlier game systems."
4,Pretty good addition to the line,"I'm not a big fan of the WotC SWRPG -- it's simply too complicated mechanics-wise for my tastes -- but this book is an excellent supplement and could be used obviously by its intended audience or by the old d6 WEG crowd with very little modification. It goes into substantive detail on a number of worlds and is well worth the price, especially for what Amazon charges."
1,Really Bad...,"I tried to cut some 1/4"" Luan plywood with this blade. I thought I had it mounted the wrong way. Nope, just a really crappy blade. Save your money and stick with the carbide tipped blades for your battery saw."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Vampires with a thing for S&M clubs. Likely to disturb quite a few people. Much nasty shagging and use of sex as a weapon, and plenty of blood and torture."
4,Sexy and functional,"This lacy corsett is very sexy with removal garters. It holds your waist in with the see thru lace. After wearing it a couple of times, I did have to mend 2 spots on the lace that were coming undone. The lace should be a little more sturdy but otherwise it does a good job."
2,"Half good, half awful...","Actually, most of this book was fairly good. But the cheesy parts were truly awful. The female lead was a real wuss and pretty clueless. I don't want to give the plot away, so I won't go too deep into the killer getting away with everything without his wife having an inkling to his evilness. One thing that the author did that bugged me was the following sentence: ""she would just assume leave everything behind"" - the sentence should read "" just as soon leave everything behind"", but that's just me nit picking the correct grammar."
4,Tina Wainscott is a good writer,Although i had a little trouble getting into this at first it was really a good book! The past always comes back to you haunt you in one way or the other! This is the situation Katie finds herself in. The intensity escalates toward the exciting climax.Don't miss this one.
5,FANTASTIC!,What a great book! I really got absorbed into the characters and kept me in suspense throughout the book. I couldn't put the book down til I found out who the bad guy was. Quite an interesting read!
4,Great story,This is my first review. I just finished the story that I started today and couldn't put it down! There are so many possible choices for who the villain is I just couldn't guess and it kept me on the edge of my seat until almost the end of the book. This is one of the first books I've read of this author and I have since bought others. Her characters are very sympathetic and I found myself at times so sad but rooting for the main character Katie.
5,Unforgivable,"Unforgettable! Absolutely delicious! Could not turn pages fast enough to see what was going to happen next. For those couple of reviewers who claimed all was predictable, all I can say is that perhaps you are Emphatics and don't realize it? I can't believe my good luck at taking a chance on new - and previously unread (by me) authors and getting so much pleasure from this book. It kept me on the edge throughout. I highly recommend to all who enjoy riveting suspense with a dollop of romance. reviewer: Barbara/No. Calif"
1,This book is unforgivable,"It is rare that I take the time to write a review, but this book was so bad that I had to warn other readers. I was stuck in the hospital with this book, desperate to have something to read to pass the time. I begged my husband to bring me something else to read - anything else. I have have never encountered such an unsympathetic, wimpy, doormat ""heroine."" Even that could have been tolerable if the writing style was acceptable. The author really needs to look at her writing and decide if she is an adult or a high school student. Hopefully, she will improve with time, that is if her publisher has the patience to put up with her present standard of performance. Save your money!"
2,Forgettable,I had this one figured out from the first few chapters. No surprises. It was a chore to finish.
2,Slightly disappointed,"I liked the idea of having an electronic cuckoo clock but this one wasn't what I thought. I expected the cuckoo thing to say ""cuckoo"" when it was time. It only speaks the hour or plays a long melody (it can be an alarm clock if you like) as far as being a clock it's great but there is no volume control and no other selections for the chime but the two I already mentioned."
2,Atomic Cuckoo Clock -- Fizzled,"Great idea and good looking, well made piece of equipment but the self-setting ""atomic - radio controlled"" mechanism didn't work and the clock looses about 2 minutes a day plus the temperature measurement got stuck at 5 degrees C and hasn't changed in a year. Everything else works great; the other digital functions (except for the wrong time and temperature); the music on the ""faux hour"" plus the appearance of the ""cuckoo."" If everything worked well I would recommend this in a minute (no pun intended) -- especially for the price that it is (or was) available."
3,Ignore the name,"A PT recommended this product to me for chronic muscle tightness in my neck. It has given me some relief, although it doesn't solve the problem by itself. The idea that it introduces a ""still point"" in fluid in your head and neck is complete bunk, I believe. When you lay down and rest your head on it, you're applying pressure to points where several muscles attach and so relieving some muscle tension. That's it, but that's not nothing when you've got a soft-tissue problem and can't get a real massage."
3,Travel towel,Good for use as a hand towel but not so great as a body towel. Skin remained quite damp after use.
2,Meh,This towel was nice and compact but it did not absorb water very well at all. Next time I travel abroad I'll likely just buy a cheap towel when I arrive.
5,The mesh bag is such a good idea!,"Dry's you off well and drys quickly hanging up. If your towel is wet while traveling around, put it in the mesh bag and clip it onto your back pack. It will dry pretty quickly and u dont have to worry about it wetting everything inside your bag."
4,Good travel towel,"I bought this towel for my backpacking trip to Europe. It takes a while to get used to the material, but it does the job and folds up nice and small. It is nice to have because you can easily throw it in a bag, just in case you need an extra towel. The towel wicks water well and comes in a convenient travel bag that can also hold a wash cloth, travel shampoo and conditioner, etc."
4,A good practical guide to NLP-enhanced training,"Are you a trainer or do you need to train people in your profession? NLP, Neuro Linguistic Programming, can be a great help to understanding how your audience is learning and how you can better help them absorb the subject material.Mr. Garrat's book contains a lot of good NLP techniques for gauging and reaching your clients and examples of how to use those techniques in a training environment. Your clients will get more out of every training session and retain more of what they've learned in the long run.If you're a trainer and you want to do the best for your clients, then this is definitely a book for you. If you want an overall introduction to NLP for more general application, take a look for 'Mindworks', another excellent book..."
5,"Artists, acid heads, sports fans","Struggling artists, acid heads, sports fans...this collection of 20 shorts offers something for everyone. Set mostly in Washington, D.C., Peabody's tight prose shows us the city that lies underneath the marble veneer in a humorous and often touching way."
5,Prevents corrosion on electric outboard motors,"I actually purchased this to retrofit a copy of an Electric motor I got off ebay. It did not come with an anode but I was able to get this one to fit, and as far as I can tell, there is no visible corrosion on the outboard yet, so I'm sure this anode is doing its job!"
5,Japanese Cooking,"If you want to learn about authentic Japanese cooking and a little more, this will be a great cookbook for you. I know for a fact that the author, Barbara Farr (aka Barbara Wies and Barbara Bassett) was extremely knowledgable, she was my mother."
5,The boys' voices are awe-inspiring!,The selection of songs reminds us of what's best in American music. The boys' voices are awe-inspiring and many times moved me to tears. I will listen to and enjoy this CD often.
2,I feel like I wasted my money,"I think this CD is a total waste of money because the only reason I bought it was to hear the girl from ""Denali"" singing - and she's not singing in these songs."
3,A skinhead book not for skinheads,"I cannot disagree with any of the reviews above. This is a well written book using the negative stereotypes associated with skinheadism.That said, if you are a traditional skinhead (read non-racist) you will be dissapointed with the assumptions in this book.At no time does the author attempt to differentiate between the many subcultures involved with skinheadism.Those comfortable with the stereotypes involved with skinheads who like simplistic detective stories you will find this entertaining.Those who appreciate realism in their reading will be dissapointed with the simplistic descriptions and gross abuse of stereotypes."
3,Only as good as the instructor using it,"I used this book for an Intro to Phonology course. It is really only as good as the person that is teaching with it. The first chapter is very intro about speech production, and then after that it's kinda blah (one would assume that distinctive features and natural classes would be addressed in the beginning, however, distinctive features are not addressed until chapter 5).If you are planning to teach yourself phonology or are working with bad professor, this book probably will not work for you. Having had the experience of working with two bad professors in a team taught course, looking to this text for answers and clarification was not really an option. There is no glossary, and new concepts are not clearly and adequately introduced.Also to note, both authors are professors in the Netherlands so there tends to be a heavy emphasis on Dutch in the examples and problem sets."
4,A Rare and Valuable Work,"This book is packed with techniques that are quite effective. There is also an interesting pictorial retrospective by the author who studied at the Japanese Police Academy. It is not a book for those looking to self teach themselves a martial art. However, those who are already familiar with some form of grappling martial art such as another form of Jujutsu, will find this book a fine addition to their collection that documents some of the history, philosophy and techniques of this powerful martial art."
4,liked this book but found some information to be inacurate,for the most part this book was well presented and informative. techniques presented clearly but could've used more pictures. good interpretation of judo techniques.
1,are you kidding me,This book is not a good self defense book or a good book on jujitsu for that matter. Pictures of techniques are awful and writing and organization are just as bad as the pics. I would recommend a submission fighting book rather than this one.
3,Un poco mejor que el anterior...,"El libro comienza nuevamente con muñecos de pvc; esta vez con una disposicion organizada. Las fotos no son de un tamaño en donde solo se pretenda ocupar espacio, como parecio ser el caso del libro anterior, y la variedad de articulos es aceptable.Un libro bueno. Ni mas ni menos..."
2,Only good for a few days,"Only use this product for a few days. Recently I bought a few and right out of the package the paint was peeling right off of them like they weren't adhered properly. When I tried Trimline Inc. customer service, several different times after contacting once I was told by a rather rude gentlemen that they had investigated it and found nothing wrong on their end (they hadn't even seen what was wrong with my items), he claimed it must have been my dog chewing on it or being active and ruining it. My dog is 16 years old! and did not chew on it. It's ashame because before this I had no problems. Like I said at the beginning, they are ok to use for a few days, but if something goes wrong with them the company seems to not backup their product and are very, very rude."
2,Sized too big for little dogs,"I ordered the small sized (six inch)collar for my nine pound Maltese and he was overwhelmed by it. Probably the smaller cat-sized collar would have worked, but the floppiness, lack of stabilizer around the neck (just string) and the fact that he couldn't see around it made me go back to my clear plastic collar. Nice idea, just didn't work for me."
2,Better Live,"I saw LeChevre open up for a band at the Handlebar before. In a live setting the songs are unique. At times, they can be too repetitive, but overall it is an good live sound.They do not, however, translate well to cd. The synths sound more like fisher price toys than the real deal.Seems like a nice guy with a decent live show, but the recording needs a little work, but hey, that's just one guy's opinion."
5,An excellent product!,"The packaging of this CD collection is the first thing to strike you. You either love it or hate it. A cardboard box with a cardboard accordian inside it. Within the accordian you find two slide drawers containing the 20 CDs and two booklets. The booklets are in French but they contain comprehensive information on all tracks in the collection. The CDs or found in cardboard sleeves each with a different photo of Edith Piaf and track listings. The music is Edith Piaf from her beginnings to her untimely death in 1963. A good remastering which doesn't fog the sound as on many CDs. Some rare tracks and live tracks. I like it, worth getting even if you own other L'integrale box sets."
4,"""Fluff"" isn't necessarly bad...and this book is quite good.","One reviewer said this book was little more than ""fluff"". I believe that lots of people look too much to external sources for the ""magic bullet"" to make them quit grieving.In my grief (widowed) I have found that this book was one that really got it right, and one of the biggest things to give me support was just being able to read someone who understood what I was going through.Menten, while I don't think he was a widower like me, somehow does a fantastic job in getting it right.I would highly suggest this book and will give it to other widows/widowers in the future."
4,more indie greatness.,"coolest band to come on the scene in a long time, must have for any collection."
2,Not very exciting...,I was disappointed with this CD. Doesn't seem to be any reason to have put it out. Most of the songs are on the first album and those versions are better. Not worth it...
2,Not worth the money,This is a poorly made collar. It is very flimsy and totally not worth the money! I expected it to be more professional but it reminds me of a cheap styrofoam hat!
3,Nasty Smell,Read the info on the Doggie Dooley website. If your ground does not perk well (drain) don't bother with this because it will stink to high Heaven. Other than than it is easy to install and maintain but our ground is not suitable for this item. I had to pull it out due to smell and flies.
4,Green way to deal with pet waste,"We've had this for at least a couple of months now, for our 50 lb. dog, and so far it is working just fine.Our primary motivation to get it was to have a more environmentally friendly way of dealing with dog waste, rather than tossing bags into the trash. Saving on not having to buy bags is also a plus.It was a little tough digging a narrow hole that was deep enough, even with a post hole digger. The manufacturer recommends 4 feet, but we could only get to about 3 or 3 and a half.The Doggie Dooley definitely smells when you open it to add waste or water, but when closed we haven't noticed any odors in our yard (which isn't very big). Considering that you essentially have a stew of dog waste sitting in the Dooley at all times, I think the lack of smell is impressive.I would definitely recommend this so far!"
3,So far so good,"We have had this product for two weeks and so far it seems to be working fine. It is cool at night so it may not be digesting, I can't tell. We have a German Shepherd and a VERY productive mini-Dachshund. The product info says it comes with a scooper. That item was not in the box nor has it arrived separately. Will update my review as the weather warms up (Phoenix, AZ)."
3,Doggie Dooley,no rake included . arrived quickly . unfortunately for me . it needs to be in the ground . I live in 5th floor apt .. trying to make it work anyway
2,A Struggle to get Through,"the book had a little of everything. Salvador Dali can be an interesting writer, and some sections of the book demonstrate this. The early chapters of the book covering his childhood are difficult to trudge through between irrational events and memories and ones that seem plausible. It is not a very good autobiography for recording ones milestones, but I suppose it recorded things that appealed and became ingrained in Dali to become motifs in his art, such as crutches for instance. As the book progressed Dali's philosophy became a little more clear and the book a little more interesting, especially as he and his wife Gala visited America and the world was prepping for World War II. All in all, I would rather have read a straight forward Dali biography than his convoluted auto-biography. You have to be a very tolerant reader to put up episodes that are difficult to visualizse or understand and to keep asking yourself, ""Is this true or is Dali dreaming it up?"""
5,"Well organized and written, a must for gardeners","This is a well organized and written book, with beautiful photography, listing all the plant material and drawings gardening lovers could follow. Thus a ""must"" for all avid gardeners."
3,Nice ideas if you own a park,"Although the landscapes in this book are beautiful, most of the properties shown were massive, complete with beautiful natural views surrounding them. It was fun to look at the pictures, but realistically, most people aren't dealing with the situations shown here. One terrace garden was shown, but it was small and unremarkable. All the properties shown are on the east coast, so the plant choices are not particularly useful for folks who live west of the Mississippi. It's an interesting way to spend a few minutes looking at the pictures, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to use in planning a garden."
2,SKIN AND GRIN,"I FOUND THIS FEATURE TO BE QUITE BIZARE.IN MY OPINION MR. POPPER SHINED LIKE A COMET.HE DISPLAYED AN EXCEPTIONAL COMMAND FOR HUMOR.WITH HIS PROTEGE ROB CASH ,THE SCENE PROVIDED A SHOWCASE FOR THEIR TALENTS. IT IS MY PREDICTION THAT MR POPPER WILL BE IN CONSTANT DEMAND FOR HIS SERVICES."
5,The Strippers Guide Review,"I found ""The Strippers Guide To Looking Great Naked"" to be both insightful and fun to read. This is a beautiful book from the glossy seductive cover to the saucy cartoons found throughout the text. You are sure to find quite a few useful tips for the bedroom and the bathroom. Plus a few good laughs."
5,Roller Coaster ride!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was quite the roller coaster ride, with exciting, frightening, joyful feelings... all throughout. I had a really hard time putting this book down..."
3,Not what I expected,"I was quite disappointed when I got this for my son on Christmas. He is very creative, loves to draw so I thought this would be a good gift for him. It basically does not improve tracing anymore than better lighting would. It came with some images to trace, a few pieces of tracing paper and 4 small colored pencils. I assumed this would allow you to trace with regular drawing paper, by using tracing paper you can trace with or without this set. The on and off button can get stuck very easily as well."
5,This book is very thought provoking.,"""People Are Never the Problem"" is an excellent book for those people out there who are looking for ""that something which goes right to the heart of the matter"". I have found myself refering to the book time and again for answers to my questions. This book gives so much, but doesn't sound preachy. I have found myself doing a lot more thinking and trying to understand where other people are coming from. I am glad that I found a book that validates ideas that I had always had, but couldn't put into words. For anyone who has ever had a relationship issue or problem, ""People..."" is a must get.note**Mr. Watts is also an outstanding public speaking instructor, and I feel very fortunate to be coached by him and hear his insights this semester!!"
2,repetitious,"This book was repetitious. ""People are never the problem"" was stated many many many times. However, the stories made the read worthwhile. I had to make myself read it, because I lost interest after the first chapter. However, I must admit that I view things a bit differently since having read it."
5,DeLeon,"I had the priviledge of hearing this sista at Bishop Eddie Long's Church Dedication on Dec. 1, 2001 and she is ""AWESOME"". When she sang, the anointing on her life was so strong, all I could do was weep. This is a must CD. I am going to order mine today."
1,ONE OF THE WORSE MOVIES EVER COPIED!!!!!!!!,"TRACKING, PIXALATED, GRAINY AND A WASTE OF TIME!!! You can 't even make out who is who!!!! DON 'T BUY IT OR WATCH IT FOR FREE!"
4,good versus evil versus nationalism,Excellent characters in a historically accurate setting with a tense and exciting story line. Realistically presented suspense. Anyone who enjoys marine adventure with the tensions of wartime will enjoy this book.
4,Good WW II Naval Warfare Tale,"I concur with the other reviewers. I've read many sea adventures and will continue to do so. I have read most of Douglas Reeman's books (including the Richard Bolitho series). While this one is not his best, it is still a good read. I'd also like to compliment the scanners. I found only two typo's in this book, both where the scanner had converted a ""h"" into a ""b"", changing ""he"" into ""be"" and ""had"" into ""bad."""
3,Potboiler,"Douglas Reeman writes well when he's describing the machinery and the conflict of war at sea. When he tries to write about actual people and human emotions, he fails miserably. His characters, particularly the main one, are ridiculous stereotypes. Several times I wished I could grab the guy, give him a couple of dope slaps upside the head, and tell him to just go ahead and deal with the situation.Jim Beckman"
4,Bullet Proof,"This little ditty protects a lens like the secret service protects the president. It's a chunk of aluminum, not a piece of plastic. Screw it on and don't worry about your lens. I dropped my lens off a 2nd story window and it shattered, but this lens cap was perfectly fine. The only downside is it take a while to screw it on, but you're just not going to get that kind of protection from a plastic clip on cap."
3,"If you buy the Griz 3118 tile saw, you need this blade as well","The Griz 3118 is a fine tile saw for the money. It's one of the few wet machines under $100 which has a 1 1/2HP motor (most machines are only 1/2 to 3/4HP). HOWEVER, the 7"" blade that comes with the machine is a POS. It will not cut ceramic tile and has trouble cutting softer natural tile, e.g. slate, as well. If you buy the 3118, be sure to buy this H4962 replacement blade and change out the stock blade as soon as you receive the saw. I might also suggest that you buy a higher quality 7"" diamond blade than the H4962 for even cleaner and faster cuts. The Griz 3118 saw is a fine machine for the money but the Griz blades are not."
2,Not a replacement for the Real Thing,"Exercises are far too complex to be demonstrated by the scarce use of pictures and vague explanations. Unless you have an experience with the workings of Pilates, don't buy this book if you are first-timer. Nothing beats the real thing - I'm going straight back to my gym work outs after this."
2,false advertising,"The lids are nothing like the one on display. There is no curves that you could use to lift nor is there a picture of a dog on the top. They are plain. They do not keep their shape after going in the dishwasher and are near impossible to place back on a can. So, I recommend hand washing. Actually, don't order if your expecting to get the display."
2,Henry Wessel by Sandar Phillips,I was somewhat disappointed in this book. It seems the editors picked the leftovers of his portfolio and saturated them in between some of Wessel's good work. This is the risk of buying a book without getting to look at it first.
4,"Easy to follow, a lot of examples and self-tests","It is an excellent opportunity to get ready for the exam. Even if you are not familiar with the RDBMS concepts, this book will help you to get ready for your OCP. A lot of examples and exercises in a book easy to read is complemented with a set of self-test exams in the CD ROM making this the complete tool to get your OCP."
3,"this book helps, but does not guarantee you to pass","Well,well, I just came back from the testing center. Fortunately, I passed, but the score is very tentative.I am not a DBA. I have very little experience in administrating oracle database. The only purpose I learned OCA exam is because I think this is the best way to obtain the key skills.During the past 3 months, I am sure I totally digested this book. But finally I found this book is far from enough to pass the test. I ordered the ""self test"" and found I can only pass 50% in the mock tests. Does the ""self test"" over kill?After taking the real exam, I found the difficulty of the real test is between the self tests and the book. If you only read this book and you do not have so much practical experience, I am sure you can not pass. I have the feeling, the knowledge in the book is too out-of-date. However, I really had not any better books to read for the test.Good luck guys."
2,Basic info for 10g R1,This book has basic info for 10g R1 however exam questions based on knowledge of 10gR2 knowledge of ASM being one of them. Don't expect to pass using just this book.
1,Wayne Koestenbaum by Wayne Koestenbaum,"So-called poet Koestenbaum has struck down yet another public figure with his teeny-tiny, myopic, totally narcissistic view of the world. His prissy, ""NOTICE ME"" prose doesn't work in a full-scale biography, and his, er, interpretations of Warhol's art are often painfully embarrassing to read. Typical femmy claptrap from the author of the ridiculous Jackie Under My Skin. Will book publishers ever wake up and learn that no one cares about this kind of ""writing"" - especially in today's much-changed world. It's completely irrevelant and insulting to other, empathetic, compassionate people. Would that Koestenbaum were such a writer. Sad."
2,Perverted,"I think that Wayne did a humiliating job with this book. He mostly focused on the [...] things that Warhol did in his lifetime. You know what i think, i think that Wayne had a crush on Andy himself, because the are both[...]and Wayne seems to like to talk about Andy's [...]"
4,Good read,It is not an academic treatise and should not be read as one. I found it a compelling read once I got into it and that it opened up Andy Warhol's `oeuvre' to me somewhat. Somewhat voyeristic and subjective in attitude but that is a fair price for the humanity and accessibility of the journey. Did not experience the writing as one-dimensional or as homo-fixated as some of the reviews suggest it to be.
4,Makes You Care Again,"This book makes you care again for Andy Warhol. In too many books and articles about Warhol, the authors seem to have some sort of vendetta against him and just want to tear him and his work down. Wayne Koestenbaum cares a great deal for Warhol, and his work. It is his work that is central to this look at his life, though from the start there is no denial of his homosexuality which Warhol himself desperately tried to keep somewhat hidden. You should have something of a familiarity with Warhol's work and life, this isn't really a good introduction to it, but it is the best interpretation of it that I have ever read. It is written with a great deal of sympathy for one of the 20th Century's greatest artists, who most critics - both hetro and homo - try to denigrate and destroy."
4,A Repetitive Artist,"Frankly, I didn't know very much about Andy Warhol until I read this book. I learned how sexual and abstract (to use one of his favorite words) he really was. The book is a nice overview. It makes me want to learn more about him and see more of his work. There is a wonderful source reference at the end of the book for anyone who may want to continue research and study of WARHOL. He definitely made a mark in the art world for the 20th Century. ...."
2,Two Bottoms don't make a Top,"In Wayne Koestenbaum's account of Andy Warhol's life and work, everything has been reduced to voyeurism and sex and that is about as redundant as one can get when discussing Warhol's contribution to modern art. The book is a quagmire of self-loathing and narcissism, it's the literary equivalent of being led through a maze by a blind person. Warhol's life story is one of hard work and dreams. This book is way too literal and never get's beyond the authors own personal neurosis to shed any light on one of the 20th century's most brilliant visual innovators."
5,Love the dress!,"THis dress is awesome, and not your cheap wal mart type knock off. This dress is beautiful and very well constructed. I love the length of the dress, as my daughter likes when the dress is to the ground. We bought a Medium, and she is a size 5/6. There is room to grow! The gown is mostly lavendar except the front of bodice has a small amount of pink in it. We also bought a poofy slip of sorts duing halloween to push the skirt out. Fun fun, love the dress!"
3,Decent,"Bought this 2 1/2 years ago when my husband and I decided to add our alma mater flags to our garden. This one seemed fine until we got the UF one I ordered, made by Evergreen Enterprises. By comparison, this one was a flimsier material and tiny. We kept this one for indoors and ordered a UA one from Evergreen for outdoors."
1,NOT WORTH PRICE IMO,"Ensure you are aware that the item does not come with the garden attachment. The only thing you get is the plastic attachment. Also, the logo can only be seen from one side."
4,Great garden flag!,This flag has held up well in the sun and rain/wind. The color has yet to fade after having it for 1 year. It also came with stuck ons for a car window too but have not used it.
2,THESE CDs ARE NOT THE COMPLETE SHOW!!!,"I have both of ""Sinbads Sounds of the 70s"" shows.(1 & 2) I cherish them ! (As a matter of fact, just watched them about 2 weekes ago!), unfortunately, they are both on a VHS Tape, since that was the format that we could record at the time. I have both shows, and on each show, each performer did at least 3 songs. If you buy this, you are cheating yourself...HBO Should have released both of these shows on DVD already"
1,Don't embarrass yourself with this book.,"An english degree? You've got to be kidding! This airy book is full of the obvious, the trite, and the truly embarrassing - note the section on (gasp) ""clever"" limericks! Many of these suggestions are not only lacking in eloquence, they are utterly inappropriate. Those that are appropriate are merely obvious. Speak from your heart, and don't waste your money on this trash!"
4,Don't Know What You Were Listening To,"I own three albums by Ronny Elliot and have seen him perform live. I think his albums are great and very well produced. The song ""A Postcard From Jack"" is killer. Who said Ron was country anyway. A unique talent in a cookie cutter world. Rock on Ron."
5,I am a Pan Fan!,"I do not know about the above album per se, but I do have a prized CD of Ron Elliott's when he created a band named PAN and created it's self-titled debut album, PAN. I have a Japanese release of the CD. I literally listen to this CD at least two or three times a day. The most stunning song on PAN is a song I heard on the radio in 1972 until 1976 called ""Lady Honey"". When I hear that song I stop everything I am doing and listen. I also love ""Rag Doll"", ""Long Way Home"", ""Dancing to the Band"", ""Delinda De Mattae"". The entire feel of the CD is that he is madly in love. Whomever he wrote that song about is the luckiest lady in the world. Thank you Ron!"
1,A very poor amateur attempt at making A CD.,This CD in no way reflects todays country music. The production quality and music are not very good as well as the arrangements. The lyric content is lacking in every respect. This CD should be on the top 10 list for the worst CD's of the year.
5,A wonderful gift,"I gave this to my niece on Christmas Eve to replace her old worn-out music cassette of 1996, played in many seasons, and she simply beamed at me in disbelief and started hearing it immediately! This exact Crystal Gayle collection is HER real way to feel Christmas sentiments. Needless to say I listened to it umpteen times before I gave it away while I decorated my place....Delivery was in a timely manner and although the CD was a used one there is no problem with it. (Good deal - the product was less expensive than shipping).I also bought the newer version of the collection, more recently remastered in 2006 which - at first - I did not like as much. But hearing it over and over I found that I even preferred it to the ""old"" one. Be it as it may, both CD's are a great addition to my Christmas entertainment and I say: Go for it!"
2,Legs will get chewed off,"We have a 2 year old adult male lab. He loves the toy, even though it took him about 2 hours and he chewed the legs completely off leaving two nickel sized holes in the toy. He still loves to chew on it, but it doesn't squeak anymore due to the missing legs/holes."
4,Superb a cappella performance,"I bought this CD after hearing the group perform live at my university. These guys are amazing in person, amazing on disc.Nearly all the music is for a cappella male quintet, with the exception of one song with piano accompaniment. Don't be fooled by the simulated rhythm section--everything is vocalized!The tightness of the harmonies is among the best I've ever heard, the range is astonishing (from a very deep bass to a confident first tenor), and the sound quality is so clean that I never heard the slightest hiss until I switched to in-ear headphones recently. You can also understand nearly every word.Actually, the lyrics are the one drawback from my perspective, as theologically speaking, they tend to be a bit trite; and there is the odd vague phrase or strained rhyme. But on the other hand, ""Far Beyond the Realm"" is a tremendous source of comfort and a beautiful picture of our hope in Christ.It truly is a loss to Christian music that they haven't continued."
1,Useless,"The screw drivers in this set are too small to offer any torque. On each screwdriver, this is a spinnable cap, which only interferes your hand from holding it tighter."
5,Spot and handle dysfunctional aviators and organizations,"This outstanding book takes the lessons of Flight Discipline and Redefining Airmanship a step further, by offering insights into individual and organizational traits that can corrupt professionalism and compromise safety.A must-read for all aviation professionals."
2,Earrings a real disappointment!,"I am a huge Amazon shopper and felt confident about buying diamond earrings on the site. I ordered two pair, round and these princess. Both pair had the same certification for color and clarity but from two different labs. The round pair were absolutely beautiful - I wear them everyday. This princess pair looked like Kmart. They were brown, spotty, very unattractive. I returned them."
2,Durability has a downside,"I bought this because the reviews for the red 10"" ball said that it isn't durable enough. Well, this one scores a ten out of ten for durability but loses points in all other categories because of it.This feels like a slightly deflated basketball. The rubber is exactly that of a basketball: thick and unforgiving when it hits you. Because it doesn't give, it's also not the best ball for kicking. Keep in mind that it's 8.5"" too, making it difficult to get a square kick.I tried this for a few minutes and then decided I didn't want to risk someone getting hurt. I went out and bought the 10"" red ball, used it for our game (a few hours with full-throttle kicking) until it transformed into an egg shape, and chunked it. While I prefer durability, the build of this ball just made it unusable.Not at all recommended."
4,Good Basic Starting Resource,"This book I got from the library and started reading. It is a good resource with basic information such as where to contact the three credit burueaus, how to organize your debt, etc. It provides good details and I recommend it to any one. By the way, if you are thinking of buying it with using a credit card, you may be missing the point. Use debit card or check instead [yeah, you with the Viss right in front of you! I'm talking to you! ;) :) ] of credit card."
1,A strict NO for starters,The author presumes that the reader has an advanced knowledge of calculus even though the book is intended for use by undergrads.the content in the chapters of the book are not enough to solve the questions at the end of ech chapter.if you are looking for an introductory course in NA dont even think of using this book.
1,Dissapointing,"The book is a chore to read. Many excersizes reference other parts of the book, requiring you to flip back and forth between sections. The proofs are almost all hand waved. The book has obvious typos as well. The book is more appropriate for a high school course than a college one- if you are a mathematician, you will find this book offensive. Buy if you need it for a class, but as a student who was subjected to this book for an entire semester, I highly recommend against using it.Oh, and the cover is hideous."
1,it makes numeric sense,"i had the pain to use this book for my undergrad. coursework for a 200 level class at Cal Poly. Contrary to the other reviewers, i believe the exercises are mediocre, and the material presented lack depth to provide a solid grounding to numerical analysis. Codes are inconveniently written in fortran-97? instead of the more readable pseudo-code. It may provide a good application supplementary for engineering students, but i strongly advise against it for mathematics undergrads. No fun. Lots of handwaving and smoking mirrors."
2,Unreadable book,"This book requires mathematical maturity. In our class most people found it very difficult to read. In the Introduction it says, that book is recommended for advance undergrads or begining grad students. I do not recommend this book for anyone interested in Intro to Numerical analysis. The Prof. teaching the class often handed out his own lecture notes, to spare students the frustration of reading this book. You will need the knowlege of Linear algebra, Diff. equ and solid knowlege of calculus to be able to folow the text. However, i guess for someone with advance knowlege in math this book may seem more beneficial, and they may be able to appreciate it more then i did. Best of luck in your studies!"
1,horrible,"Being a university math major, first time in my life i have ever came across a math text with practically no solutions in the back of the book. Since the text is so complex you never know if your doing things right half the time with no answers to assure yourself. Horrible math book, made for a tough couple of months..."
5,Perfect first watch for son!,My 8 year old son has had this watch for 8 months and it has never left his arm.
2,Not that funny,"The booklet is pictures of postcards mailed to the deceased, sans address. I'm not surprised they hit the circular file instead of being returned. The art is awful. The description was much funnier than the book turned out to be."
1,Looks like someone's Grade School Project,"I ordered this sight unseen while in Iraq. As bored as I was, I don't think I got one iota of entertainment out of this book. I try not to take chances like that anymore."
2,Trompe L'Oeil: Techniques & Projects,"The only reason this reviewer gave 2 stars is for the faux finish stone effects. The remainder of the work, the so called trompe l' oeil effects, look as though done by a beginning artist.They are very unprofessional.Can't compare with Christofer Westall, Joyce Kerr Holding or Roberta Gordon Smith."
3,Guinevere Jones Series...,"Third in a series and the romance between Guinevere and Zachariah is moving slowly.I've read everything I could get my hands on written by Jayne Ann Krentz (and her many pen names!) over the years. This series has left me feeling like the spark is gone...and cookie cutter plots and story lines are in.Bottom line, the stories are weak and not very good examples of her wonderful writing style.That said, I will continue to buy stories written by Jayne. I am, and will continue to be, a huge fan. Hope this review helps."
2,Dated,Readers who love Jayne Castle's futuristic romantic mystery novels will be sorely disappointed in what is a reprint of an early work that has not aged well.
4,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK,"The start of a new series, I hope. A good romantic couple a lot of suspense. It was left open for a sequel."
4,"Delicious and easy, requires sugar","Very good flavor, if not very authentic, Thai tea. Each packet contains sugar, tea mix, and creamer, but I always had to add more sugar for it to taste just right. In fact, this restaurant I frequented used these packets when making their $2 per glass Thai tea, with some sugar and ice mixed in. This drink is not very healthy unfortunately, but good for an occasional treat."
5,Black and Decker Jar Opener,"I have one of these and bought one for my daughter-in-law, this thing is great and I would give up a lot of my other applinces before giving up this. I have used it for over a year and it is still working great, Would (and have) recommend this in a minute."
4,Works Just Fine,"Having owned one of these items (Lid Opener) in the past, I searched the Internet to find another. Since receiving the item we have used it numerous times to our complete satisfaction. I would recommend it to friends and family. I give it an A-one for convenience and ease of use."
4,B&D Jar Opener,"Works well for standard size jars, if you purchase restaurant size you cannot fit jar into machine"
2,Not very useful - save your money,"I purchase this jar opener to use when my husband was not around. I am small and have very small hands. This device was a disappointment because it does not fit large jars. That is all I have trouble opening! Also, it is unsightly and bulky to store. Save your money. I have not taken it out since a few days after I purchased it."
5,Extremely helpful ~ Completely satisfied.,"This is my old stand-by. Lidds Off loosens lids for me when nothing else will work.I can set containers up to 8"" tall and 4 1/2"" wide in it's mouth to be opened.So far I haven't had any problems with it's power or construction.I'm not usually a fan of Black & Decker products ~ but this has been a great product.When the top is pulled fully up it locks in place.That's nice for loading/un-loading items and very convenient for cleaning.The lid also locks down to stay closed ~ that makes the handle reliable to carry it with.It does take up more counter space then I like ~ 9 1/2"" tall and 8 1/2"" wide ~So I store it in the pantry until I run into what would other-wise be an impossible lid."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my Mom who has arthritic hands. It will work if all the conditions are right.If the gripping section of the lid is on the upper part only, the opener will reach below and can't get enough grip to open the jar. This is a problem with Mason jars. If the jar has a smooth edged lid, it won't work. Product needs to go back to the Engineering Department."
2,Does not handle tough jobs well,"Once in a while, we end up purchasing a jar that is just impossible to open. I thought a jar opener would help me in such situations and that is why I purchased this product. When I tried to open two of the toughest jars (which I could not open with my hands), the product failed to open them. We eventually opened both jars by heating the lids and using special jar opener pads. The product worked fine with the easy-to-open jars.I think this is a good product for people who have problems opening any sort of jars - including easy-to-open ones. It did not work for me. If jar openers had objective measures for their opening ability (example: ""upto 25 torques of force""), I could have performed a more objective review."
4,What a pickle.,Collapse to a relatively small size for storage. Works great oneverything up a quart jar. Too bad my Vlasic Pickle jar doesn't fit. What a pickle.
5,The Help I Needed.,"I have had Surgery on my right shoulder which has severly limited the strength of that arm. I am 76. I live alone. Without this Jar Opener there are many jars which would cause severe pain to open. Thanks to the JW200 I don't have to avoid some of my favorite foods when grocery shopping.I trust this review is, tho short is acceptable. [...]"
3,Bulky but helpful,"I had been considering one of these but wasn't sure I wanted to spend that much. Then I found one in a thrift store a few months ago. Since it was marked as 'working', decided to take a chance. It is bulky so if space is a problem you probably won't be happy. It seems to work okay on the range of jars I use but it does have a height limitation. And I can see where odd shapes might not work.For the 5 bucks I spent it has been helpful as I have serious arthritis. I am not sure I would spend more."
3,one way only,"This appliance is very good at opening jars. However, with arthritis I would like to be able to TIGHTEN LIDS ON also. The twisting motion is so hard to do in both directions."
1,Doesn't work,I really like this product WHEN IT WORKS! It opens jars like a charm - but when you turn it on it usually won't start and I have to bang on the switch and so far it has started twice. I really should send it back.
3,"If you NEED it, it is okay.","I got this because of increasing problems with carpal tunnel. When it is bad the twisting motion is completely impossible for me, and even when things are good, it is better to avoid motions that cause trouble for me.This will open most of the jars I need opened. It takes a long time to get it open. It is noisy. It is clunky to use. Sometimes it is difficult to get it into position to start opening the jar, and with some disabilities I imagine it would be impossible.If this had worked as well as I had hoped, I would have bought some as gifts for my elderly relatives, but I think it would cause them more trouble than it was worth.If you really need it, like I do, go ahead, but if you are just a gadget hound this will end up on the trash pile. It is not cool or impressive."
1,Lids Off?,"The first jar we tried to open with this machine tore the rubber padding off the griping jaws rendering the machine useless. It won't open anything now. I wouldn't buy one unless you have someone around to break the jar lid loose first. Too bad, it was something we needed."
1,Disappointed,I received this product and still can't figure out how to use it..no instructions and no info on how to return it. I am disgusted and isappointed.
4,Great buy,This thing really works. The one draw back I see is that it should be a little taller so that the higher jars would fit but it definitely works.
1,Did not work well at all,"I purchased this product as a gift for my 80-year-old mother. While she was initially excited about it, it soon became clear that the jar opener was going to work: (1) only intermittently; and (2) only on a limited variety of jars. On the few occasions when it did decide to work, it required substantial hand manipulation. This was the case both when my mother tried it solo, and when her daughter and son-in-law tried to do it. Not a useful product."
3,An improvment I think necessary,THE UPPER JAWS DO NOT CLOSE SMALL ENOUGH FOR SLIM NECK CONTAINERS. I made a adaptor that will work on sparklets water bottles that my wife can get them open without help.
4,"for the elderly, or those with arthritis, a must","This is one of those items that is needed for those with arthritis or for the elderly---it makes opening jar lids simple, once you can figure out how to make it work! That is the one flaw in the item: the directions are not as easy to follow as the item's operating procedures. So, someone needs to show the recipient how to operate this handy item; but once you know how to work it, it's a great device for the kitchen."
5,Black & Decker Jar Opener,I bought it as a gift for my sister-in-law because I have had one for years and love it. With arthritis in my hands the jar opener is a Godsend to me.
5,works like a charm!,"I purchase this (in my job) for my clients who have difficulty opening jars due to physical problems. It is easy to use and having tried other products, this one seems to work the best! If you have weakness in your hands, this will make opening jars a breeze! Amazon's price is lower than what I typically pay."
4,Don't you think that is overkill?,"That is what my husband said when he first saw the jar opener. He told me that he would open any jar I needed open. (I need it because my thumb joint has an injury.) You already know what is coming. I handed him a jar and after struggling with it for a while, he stuffed it in and let electrical power have its way with the lid. If I have a complaint it would be the minor one that if I don't push the release button just right, it sticks. It does not stay stuck and when I press it again, it releases. This opener is my one countertop appliance. If you need it, you will really appreciate it."
4,"Great product, but takes up a lot of counterspace","This works really well for someone with limited hand strength and on a variety of jar widths. However, it takes up a lot of counterspace & a undermounted version would be handier."
3,Doesn't work as good as they say!,"I bought this for my mom who has arthritis is her hands really bad thinking this would be great for her...it isn't as good as they say, although it works for the most part, the lid has to be a certain size for it to work really well."
2,A Blackmark for Black&Decker,"Very disappointing. Great concept, Poor execution.I've had one for <3 years, and have not needed to use it much in that time (thankfully), but it is totally inoperative as of today. The motorized lid gripper has stopped moving-in to grab the jar top ...so now it just revolves making a promising but unfulfilling torque-y electric motor noise.It was great for about my first month, then it became a major pain-in-the-rear when the adjustable grips in the base stopped moving-in to fit automatically and to size it manually took substantial effort. Got even worse when the glued-on rubber on the grippers came off.Sadly the Black & Decker name is no longer synonymous with quality, like I used to think it was."
2,Jaromatic is a superior jar opening appliance.,"Black & Decker ""lids off"" is very limited in the size of jars and bottles it will open. Jaromatic opens them all and costs much less. Information at: www.jaromatic.com. Compare price and features."
3,i like the product,i ordered about 8 things and had to pay shipping on each...had known that they would all be sent separately i wouldn't have ordered anything...it took all the savings away...
1,Works almost as well as $5 non-electric model,"We put it to the test -- jar vs. jar. The electric model worked ok, but the $4.99 under-counter model worked faster and easier, and took up no counter space. This is one electric gadget you can do without."
2,Ho[sic] many people people really need it?,"I'm sure SOMEBODY needs one these. Probably, though, you sell most of them to the people ho buy Patton Tank sized SUVs. I find that I spend more time looking for the magic gadget than I save by using it.BT_, the letter key [the one beteen Q and E on the keyboard] does not ork.thanx."
2,Try a strap wrench,"I have not tried the B&D Lids Off, but have used a Sears ""Strap Wrench"" ($9.99) to open jars for many years. If you have two hands, you may find the strap wrench just as effective. It does not use electricity, you can store it in a drawer, and you can use it for other things."
3,Fair Jar opener review,The opener has too limited a size for opening jars. It is also somewhat limited to strength. I still have to rely on my husband to open some jars.
3,Weak Handle,"Machine is 20 months old, never damaged. Handle is fracturing where it is molded to the top. Fracture is over 1"" and expanding. B&D sold responsibility on most household items to Applica Inc. in 1998. Nice to know that piece of info when machine was purchased new in 2003 and B&D doesn't want the responsibility."
5,Fantastic product!,"This is a great, useful product for a senior citizen or anyone with limited hand/arm strength. My mom would always have a couple of jars lined up for me to open whenever I visited and was somewhat chagrined at having to ask. Unless you commonly buy giant economy sizes, it will probably handle most of the jars in your pantry (it easily accommodated a tall pickle jar and a 32-oz mayonnaise; those were the largest we had on hand)."
1,Opens easy jars,"I was interested in trying this product as a gift for someone with arthritis. I tried it on a peanut butter jar with a serrated lid (which it opened easily) and on a pickle jar (which it couldn't open at all!) What good is a jar opener that won't open a pickle jar? For about $4 you can buy a ""jar pop"" from an Amazon vendor or your local kitchen store. It works better and stores easily in your silverware drawer."
2,Not much better than a Google search,"This book doesn't really stretch into new areas. Instead, most of the material are tired old rehashed that you could find simply by googling for it. Sure, it is nice to have it all in one place - and the design is acceptable - but for the price I expected more than you would find in the various net books."
4,Nice addition!,"I started my gnome as a gemcrafter, wondering if there was something I could do to make that skill useful. I took alchemy, and craft wonderous items as a lark. Turns out, I made the perfect pre-cursor to the Jewel-mage.He started his elf as a wizard, in a dragon cult. He took all the other craft item feats for fun. Turns out, he also is the pre-cursor to a Dragon-mage.If you're looking for something more to do with your character and the prestige classes you've seen so far just don't cut it, then check out this book!"
5,Denby Teapot,"This is a wonderful teapot. It does not drip, very stable, lovely color that matches my set.Makes about 6 cups of tea with one filling.Denby stoneware does not chip or stain, easy to clean. On the heavy side but great handle."
1,will not load on mac!,this said its for mac and its not. its for every thing else but a mac. absolutely will not load load!
3,Wow,Good book very heart breaking go relive cheesecloth but releasing to read bis life and effects o. The galaxy's most famous
4,Memories of Chewie,"This kind of makes up for the terrible way Chewie dies in Vector Prime, but not quite. the only thing I personally HATE about this comic book is the way the author makes Princess Leia sound like a selfish brat."
1,Poorly made,One star because after two and a half months the little red tags on the inflation nipples tore off. You can't deflate it without that tag. If it wasn't for that I really liked it. I'm an airline pilot and use this in the airplane. I can't keep it inflated like some people. I have to deflate it and can't carry plyers around to deflate it either. When I get back home I'm going to see if I can rig it up somehow to pull it out but still should be made with a better system. I noticed most people don't like the design of the self sealing nipples but I like the design it's just made of cheap rubber.Frowny ---> :(
3,Seat Cushion,"Product seems to work well with overall good construction, but the valves are extremely difficult to use."
2,"Filling it with Air is easy, when filled works great, but leaks","It has a self sealing valve, so those looking for something to push into the value don't understand it. Just blow and push whole value stem inside where it self closes. When it works it works better then anything I've found, much much better than the useless foam cushions which flatten quickly and cant even be re-inflated. Unfortunately even when properly sealed, the self sealing values can leak. Out of 3 that I bought, two have one side that leaks. I'm going to try to glue one shut with crazy glue. Thinking this would be a good business opportunuity as wouldn't take much to make one with a simple value that works. Anybody interested?"
1,Poorly designed--nearly impossible to inflate,"Don't waste your money. Poorly designed. I practically ruptured a brain vessel trying to blow it up. If you are lucky enough to actually fill it with air--you won't be able to get the valves shoved in before lots of air leaks.I injured my tail bone in bike accident and found an ordinary memory foam pillow to be a much more comfortable, portable and reliable choice."
4,very good,I purchased this for my husband and he likes it very much. The only thing wrong is the valves which are very hard to work. I wish the company would make them different. I ordered 2 and had to return 1 because it wouldn't hold air. I have 1 that was purchased 3 years ago and the tabs on valves have broken off but my husband still uses it and uses pliers to open valves.
1,Duro-Med Twin Inflatable Seat,I when I inflate the cushion I can't get the cushion to hold air because the plug thing doesn't plug the hole. I'm not able to use the cushion.
3,"Good Listen, Decent Album","Overall, Minotaur Shock's third full-length release is fairly solid as far as the somewhat arbitrary ""folktronica"" genre goes. As with Rinse and Chiff-Chaffs and Willow Warblers, Edwards forces the audience to strain to discern a specific melody in any given song, though here he takes an entirely different approach to doing so. The subtle piano lines found in songs such as ""The Range"" have been replaced with a near cacophony of synth lines that are at certain points overwhelming. While it is a decent listen, it is a definite departure from his more IDM minded releases.The highlight of the album is most likely ""Vigo Bay"", a strange mix between glitch and synth pop that honestly defies categorization. There aren't any distinctly remarkable moments on Maritime that other artists haven't explored with more finesse, though I doubt any first time Shock listeners will be thoroughly disappointed."
1,Not an inspirational book by any means,"Having read the works of Bill Bryson and Jan Curran (which I would recommend) I was looking for an additional perspective on the AT experience and was disappointed by this book. This book is Edward B. Garvey's trail log for his hike on the AT. It is (over) filled with his day-to-day activities such as when he woke, who he met on the trail, what he ate, and when he went to bed. Unfortunately, there isn't much else. A few short descriptions such as ""it was a nice view from the top"" but the real disappointment of this book is that it fails to put the reader on the trail with him to experience what it is to hike the AT. If the writer would have done that, this book would have been worthwhile."
4,facts on horses,"This book is not a child's book, but contains information on every horse topic conceivable. It's a good reference for someone new to horse ownership because it contains information on just about everything!"
4,Good gospel,Myra Walker and her singers have good voices and lend them to some slow emotional and uplifting songs.A good mix of both if you like traditional gospel music then you will enjoy this CD.
4,good book once again,"I would recommend this book for wiccan like myself the rituals baths and meditations (with less structure) and only a gods know how they react to the person . I would not turn to it as a prime resource for male aspect however for information. However, I was inspired to check out the author's bibliography to see where she got her background information. and suggest the witches god and goddess on working with deity . Just do the reseach on gods you are draw to and this book is nice for visualizations as all book they do have a opinion.Still nice book overall"
4,Good as a resource.,"The only thing I didn't like was too much of the authors intrepration of the myths. Of course she's allowed (it's her book after all), but that's not what I bought it for. I was looking for a way to connect with the God which I got a bit out of but not enough.But I guess if I had paid more attention to the title I would have figured that out myself."
3,Not as advertised,"These knives do feel nice in your hand, but I was disappointed in finding out they had a serrated edge...not sure how one is supposed to ""sharpen these easily"". The description is somewhat misleading."
5,great steak knives,"this was a real bargain for really great cutlery; the knives are beautiful; the feel and balance of each knife lets you know that these are fine cutlery; they cut through ""like butter"". you won't be disappointed."
3,Correction to my previous review - excuses to Rhodes,"I am writing after one of the author, Ron Rhodes, wrote me about my previous review. I had assumed he was responsible for the definition of cultism included in the book, and for the inclusion of Catholicism. Rhodes explained that it was Geisler who entirely worked out the definition of what a cult is and entirely insisted for the inclusion of Catholic interpretations in the book.Rhodes points out that they (the authors) still) wrote on p. 18 that catholicism is not a cult, which I appreciate. But I still do not understand why then include catholic interpretations in such a book?All my excuses to Ron Rhodes and for saying of him that I understood him to be rather ""fanatical"". I must have been angry to see Catholics included in this book on cultists, hence the lack of thoughtfulness in my previous review. Well I am disappointed by what Geisler has done in this book. Of all his books, it clearly remains the one I like the least."
2,Attitude check,The author is too quick to jump to conclusions. This may work in some instances but not when it takes some thoughtful scriptural analysis first.
4,Informative,This book is a very informative look at the different groups of African American who call themselves Muslims. The focus on Imam Jamil Al Amin is especially interesting.
4,Dessler Knows the Field,"Dessler's approach in Human Resource Management is thorough, comprehensive, contemporary, and very readable. The figures, tables, and other visuals are excellent for models and practical use. The cases and application exercises are relevant to the real world and greatly assist in the overall understanding of the main concepts of each chapter. Chapters on employee testing and selection, appraising performance, job analysis, and personnnel planning and recruiting, are particularly well presented. The complexities of establishing pay plans and financial incentives are explained in simple terms for the reader and include revelant examples. The text also comes with supplementary materials which greatly enhance it's use and application. This book can be used for lower as well as upper division courses at the University or College level."
4,thorough and detailed,"i am a business final year undergraduate taking applied personnel policy, i find this book quite useful, even though it is not the prescribed text but i think it's worth the money."
2,Item Delivered is not the item ordered.,"I spent considerable time searching the web for ""Norell By Norrell"" and all of my efforts were wasted. After the order arrived (and had been used) I lifted the bottle and noted that it said ""Norrell by Five Star"". Norrell by Five Star is nothing but a liscensed knockoff and it does not have the lasting aroma of Norrell by Norrell. Had I wanted Norrell by Five Star, I could have bought it from any of the twenty, or so, web sites that advertised it as such. I expect to be delivered exactly what I order and nothing less."
2,norell by norell for women,I am disappointed in this cologne. I used the cologne for years and loved it until I couldn't find it anymore. Was told it had been discontinued. This must be a knockoff as the scent is not like I remember it
1,What Is Wrong With It?,"I used to wear this perfume back in the 70's and 80's and that is what it smells like now - OLD perfume. I was very disappointed. A friend had purchased a bottle for my birthday remembering how much I loved the scent. Decided to purchase and got the ""Old"" smelling perfume instead. Wear my Donna Karen now."
5,"bumpy, lumpy and somewhat grumpy.","Nothing alarming, nothing condescending... just a matter-of-fact description and explanation of the changing woman's body. Reading this book in the months following Lucy's birth helped ease my worries about the bizzare things going on with my body. Having read enough about pregnancy and birth that there really were no suprises, my own body following the birth seemed quite an alien being."
4,Not entirely satisfied,"This was a Christmas present for my son, we haven't watched all the dvd's yet. But one of them was bad, it kept getting hung up."
5,Hey Haw episode 372,"This was one of the best episodes I've seen so far, it's hard to believe what kind of talent they had on that show. The best part of it is, it was all clean and hilarious fun."
2,Too much Statler,"I realize the Statlers were big at the time and having them as guests was probably a big-deal booking for the show. But they were inserted into so many skits that I missed the regular cast. Let's be honest here too, yes the Statlers have stage chops... but not for skit comedy."
2,Pretty but Not Sturdy,"I bought this a year ago and have had it continually fall apart. It's very stylish and looks great, but the way the rack itself attaches to the wall mount is by one tiny little surface screw. The mount is secure in the wall, but the weight of the double towel rack bends the tiny screw its leaning on where it attaches to the wall-mount and falls down. I've even purchased larger surface screws that won't bend and that held it up for the past 6 months, but those are failing now too.Bottom line is that if you get a double rack (which is a worthy convenience) make sure to investigate how the rack attaches to the wall mount and that it is more than what you would use to attach a TP holder.Don't recommend this product, and subsequently the manufacturer."
2,We had 3 Good Years,"I have been faithful Bespoke Labs T3 user for the past 4 years. The first 3 of those years were fantastic! The past year, the hair dryer has been burning my hands and my hair. I don't know what happened. The filter is clean and I didn't change my settings. Figured this T3's life was over and I'd just get a new one. Kinda short life for a hair dryer that's over $100. Anyway, I went to look online. But you Amazon reviewers now rate the BabyBliss better than the T3. I was hesitant because of the weight increase. But I bought the Baby B. It dries my hair in half the time of the T3 and no burnt hands. The BabyBliss has a lot more power than my old T3 and scares my long, thick, frizzy hair straight and smooth in 15 minutes."
1,A Major Piece of Crap,Simply put.....it's overpriced and over-hyped. Only lasted a year and blew out only cold air. The company wanted even more money to repair it........NOPE!! Not another penny will they get from me. Using my much older drug store model which works better and dries faster. Don't waste your money.
1,Unhappy customer,The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.
1,Horrible,"I paid twice the price listed here at Amazon for this dryer at a local health and beauty chain. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it is lightweight. I've had it for about 6 months and the air coming out of it is lukewarm at best. I have terrible breakage close to my scalp, all over my head, which sticks straight up and looks ridiculous. I asked my hairdresser about it and he said it was likely related to my blow dryer. I agree, since I have never had this problem before. I don't find that it dries your hair any faster than any other model. As for your hair staying ""healthier"", I've never seen mine in worse shape! I'm ordering a Twin Turbo (the only my hairdresser uses) to replace this subpar product. Extremely disappointing."
2,It's good but does not last...,"It's a very good dryer, as long as it works. It broke after about a year of little usage. I bought it for about $200 and thought it would last for much longer than that.Only now I read it is NOT COVERED BY MANIFACTURER WARRANTY!!!I would not buy it again, unless the manifacturer started covering it for at least 2 years."
2,Great while it lasts,"I have had 2 T3's in the past three years, well technically three. My first T3 stopped working after a year and I purchased a second. My first broken one, my hairstylist was able to send back for me on her account and they fixed it and that became my back up. My then 2nd T3 worked for a year broke, and my back up (the repaired first T3) lasted 2 1/2 months. This is a great dryer while it works, but at 200 a pop, I expect it to last longer than a year, and I only dry my hair 2-3 times a week for 15 minutes. So, unfortunately I would say look elsewhere until they fix it. My former stylists owns a salon, they only use T3s however, she is constantly sending 3-4 of them back at a time to be replaced. The company will do that for stylists with great accounts for them but for the average purchaser you go through hoops to get it fixed. Not worth the hassle."
4,False advertising,"The dryer works great, however the item is refurbished and was not said anywhere on the seller's website. To late now to return as my old dryer burned out.I am stuck with another case of dishonesty from a merchant."
3,Works - For a short time,"I had this hair dryer for 3 years - so a little longer then others on this post. However, I don't blow dry my hair every day. I spent about $180 on this hair dryer. It was an investment. It worked great for about 6 months. The other 2 1/2 years it worked as well as a dryer you can get at the drugstore. And today it stopped working completely. I do clean the filter and every thing. So I don't recommend investing in this. And the other posts are right - Bespoke is NOT covered by warranty by T3 - a complete rip off."
3,CHASING AWAY THE BLUES!,"I love a man who cries but this hero was too much even for me. He was supposed to be a tough undercover ATF agent but as soon as he went under to find his twin brother's killer and met the heroine, he went all soft in the head!"
5,Good mystery and good romance,"This is my first book by Dinah McCall, but it will not be my last. Sharon Sala is also a favorite of mine and I just found out tonight that Dinah McCall and Sharon Sala are one and the same."
2,only if you like to read about stupid women,"I was not happy as I kept reading this book. The author made the heroine (Gillian) a complete bimbo. If you like to read about women who live like a witless brainless twit, then this book is for you. The reviews say they made readers laugh? I couldn't muster up the energy to utter one giggle - not when the heroine acts like a 14 year old. I could not identify with the hero (Noble) either. He just shows up - No background on what makes him tick. Thank goodness my purchase was only $.99!"
5,Highly recommended!,"This is a great book that had me hooked from start to finish.I loved the plot and the characters. An interesting story loaded with amusing situations and dialogue and genuine humour. I found myself quite literally ""laughing out loud"".This is the sort of book that even before you finish, you can imagine yourself re-reading it over and over again.This is the first Katie MacAlister book for me but it certainly won't be the last."
1,Can someone really be so naive?,"I had a hard time getting through this book. The main character is beyond naive. She is actually made to look very very stupid, yet her cousin talks about how smart she is at the beginning. She continues to get even dumber throughout this story line. It is hard to follow and a lot of it leaves you thinking what just happened?"
1,"hard to read, hard to follow, hard to like.","i struggled to finish this, and the only reason why was bc there was a mystery and i wanted to know what the ending was. As a mystery, it failed, as a romance it failed. The tone was written like a farce, reminding me vaguely of ""the importance of being earnest"" at least the film, but it lacked charm. the herione was supposedly clumsy, but warm hearted and charming, but she came across as a ditz, and i failed to see the charm. it really needed 400 pages more to flush out the story better. The story was also difficult to follow because the scene changes without warning so when it happened it was really jarring. I just couldn't connect with the characters and the storyline just didn't flow well. Now that I know the ending I don't even know why I bothered to finish this.There was so many loose ends....I mean why the dogs?"
2,horrible...,"The heroine is unbelievably naive to the point of being idiotic. I read thru the book in one sitting, but had to force myself to finish it just so that I could move on as quickly as possible. The way this author writes, you have to read, then reread the passages because the thought processes of the heroine are such a jumbled hot mess. I tried to like her, I really did, but honestly, literally throwing yourself at your husband in not one, but 3 different scenes, almost knocking him over (succeeding actually once)?! And THAT'S how he's redeemed in the eyes of society?!?! Oh no... 2 stars for the couple of scenes that had me chuckling, and for the fact that it's $.99. This is the first time I was led astray by Amazon reviews so I had to wrote a review of my own. Read with no expectations, and maybe you'll enjoy."
5,Pretty Great,"I really liked this book. The author is funny and her characters are endearing. Really, I couldn't put it down, so if you are looking for a quick read with good characters and a good story, download it now!"
2,Noble Intentios,"Very silly. Seems the author was attempting to be funny. No one could be so absent minded and not get on your nerves. It is also silly that after one dance, this couple marries in four days. I did not waste my time any longer. I read 20% of the book and moved on. Thank goodness I only paid $.99"
3,"Okay, but I've read better.","I am only giving this book 3 stars because it made me laugh in a few places. The heroine was zany to the point of stupidity. Her accidents were a little over the top. ... In this book, the only real accident was the first one. All of the others were contrived by the heroine."
1,Skip It,"It may or may not be fair to write a review having read only the first half of this book, but...I couldn't get through the last half of the book no matter how hard I tried. I wanted to like this story, especially because Macalister has written such funny books as ""Improper English"" and ""Men in Kilts."" However, this more historical romance falls very flat. The characters barely know each other and we are barely given time to know them. Their motivations are not very clear as to why they like one another and eventually marry, and the female is the typical nave virgin. I found the book lacking in character development for sure, and in plot as well. It read like a teen book and not the adult novel it was supposed to be. Reading the first half was a bit like having a tooth extracted without a painkiller - excruciating. I will still look for Macalister books, but the more modern ones."
2,Dear lord,"I wanted to like this book but I found I just could not. I'm sure there are some people out there who don't mind an idiot for a heroin but this is beyound that. If you are like me and want the heroin *not* to act like a twit half the time skip this book!!!Gillian is a to put it nicely a moron. I mean my god the part when Nobel is tied to the bed well I think it was supposed to be funny I found muself emberessed on her behalf.Not to be fait the book was in some parts funny, but I feel that it dose not make up for Gillians stupidity. So if you want a book that has a idotic, vapid, moron of a heroin this book is for you. But if you want a book where you actually feel like the heorin could think her way out of a paper bag STAY FAR FAR AWYAY FROM THIS BOOK!!"
4,Highly enjoyable,"I thought this book was well written, I enjoyed it very much. The main character Gillian, made me laugh, with all her unfortunate little mishaps. At first Gillian seems shallow but she turns out to have a very deep insight, when it comes down to her husband and her stepson's feelings. I'm looking foward to reading more from this author."
4,Not your average historical romance...,"I really loved this book. It's not your average regency, because the characters say and od things that really aren't typical for the period, Both Gillian and Noble were excellent characters, believing in each other and their love from the start. There were laugh out loud moments, and several sweet ones as well. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a sweet love story without a lot of angst."
2,Where do these reviews come from?,"This was not that funny. The main character was a idiot. Tripping around, causing unnessary havoc in your wake is idiotic. It made her seem a buffoon . Not a charming, whimsical, whit. Where is the lol humor? She looked pathetically inept and clueless. I give it two stars because the price was low enough I wasn't too irate at wasting my time on it. From now on very little of what others think will go into my reason to buy a book./"
3,Standard Katie Macalister,"If you're familiar with her books, then you'll know exactly what to expect (for those fans who have come from reading Aisling Grey or the Dragons series, characterization is the same, shenanigans are the same, the only thing missing is the paranormality and magic). You'll even recognize a stock character in an old man who attends the balls. For those of you looking for a strictly historical romance, this may not be for you."
1,One Star is Generous,Pay attention to every one star review written about this book - they are all true! I only made it half way through and then realized I was embarrassed reading it and dreading turning to the next page. Thank goodness I only spent .99 on it.
3,Noble Intentions,"This was a fun, entertaining and romantic novel.It also contains suspense and mystery. If you like settings in olden England with titles thrown in, you will enjoy this one. A very easy read."
5,Consuming and hysterical,This book sucked me right in and had me laughing so hard I cried. I am sure the neighbors heard me laughing outside. This book has characters that are very vivid . You have to force yourself to put it down. A truly delightful romp into fantasy!
4,Light and funny,"This historical novel was light, humorous, and had wonderful characters and an entertaining storyline. What more could you ask for?"
5,Wonderful,"This was my first Katie MacAlister book, and one of my favorites. The characters are well thought out and the secondary characters just add sparkle to the book. This is a funny, laugh out loud book. The heroine is smart and spunky and the hero perfectly brooding. A very enjoyable read."
1,so bad i couldn't finish it,"wow!! i don't know how so many people could love this story. it was so unbelievable from the very contrived beginning til the mid point that i couldn't even finish it.not funny, not romantic, just annoying!! if only i trusted the one star reviewers!!"
1,Just plain silly.,"Noble Intentions quickly crosses the line from from humorous to ridiculous. The plot is not well defined and serves more as a loosely drawn backdrop to the lunacy running rampant through the story. The hero has no depth, the heroine is a joke and the secondary characters do nothing to redeem the story. There are a few steamy scences, but unfortunately in the author's attempt to be ""all funny all the time"", they come across as silly rather than sensual. While admittedly, the second half was a bit better than the first, it was still way out there on the madcap scale. I really had a hard time staying with this one."
1,Disappointing,I did not find this a great read. The characters are flimsy and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.
3,OK but not what I expected,Contained some good information but not as comprehensive as the Ultimate Guide.
2,Surprising Opposites,This book begins with easy to understand opposites and progresses to more difficult concepts. One of these is ABSTRACT/CONCRETE where abstract is an abstract painting and concrete is depicted by a cow! You should be prepared to explain this concept to a 2-1/2 year old! One additional problem comparison in the book is CANDY/MEDICINE. The differences between the red items is not clear enough and I would not recommend this title for younger than six.
3,Beautiful illustrations,"Beautiful illustrations. Reading it aloud to my daughter, I felt like it went on a little too long, and she seemed to lose interest before we got to the end."
3,Not Very Economical,"The quality of the photographs generated by the Printer Dock 4000 are superb. The pictures are super. Figuring the costs associated with the Printer Dock, the user will find out each photo costs about $.63 using the dock. Several photo shops and even the common drug stores will produce outstanding photographs from your digital camera for just $.29 per photo. Some online photo services will also provide this service. My opinion is that the Printer Dock 4000 should not be purchased. It is not an economically sound decision, but the convenience is great."
1,Nothing Much to Write Home About,"Like Janus, this book had two faces, one bad and one ugly. I do not mind it if an author is going to pass off an old, well-used story line on us - this is the spy mole hunt with the odd pairing of hinters, but you have to make it interesting. We just kind of moved through this book at a plodding pace that never picks up, the characters are so weakly described that you really never care to find out what happens. I heard he was a good author so I struggled through to the end, but I now regret the lost time."
2,The average spy roman,"This book could have been much, much better if Forbes would have described better his characters. The story is about a Russian spy known as Balkan, who is the head of one of the European headquarters of the SIS. The chief of the European sector, Tweed, tries to find out, who the black sheep is. His help is a newswriter called Newman who is actually his bodyguard. The plot is too simple and the characters don't really have ""faces"". If we forget about this, the book is good, readable, but not so much enjoying. That's the cause of the 2 stars."
1,Good for trashing film,"I tried this camera for an ongoing art project that required lo-fi analog images. So far so good. The first one I tried came apart after 20 rolls shot. The second camera was doing well but after 10 rolls I noticed overexposure on some shots as well as a whole lotta shaking even when used at shutter speeds of 1/125 and 1/300. I had it checked and the shutter is simply non functional. And I really take care of my equipment nontheless its price. So after two cameras broken for no apparent reason, no, I wouldn't recommend this to a friend. Not even to my worst enemy."
1,damaged goods,"The camera came damaged, with the parts of the body and lenses misshapen and bent so badly it wouldn't work. Even though the camera was still advertised on Amazon, Adorama- the seller- said they had no more in stock and couldn't say when they would get any more in. Again, Adorama still has 'available' for this camera on Amazon's website.While we did get a reasonably quick refund, it still was a frustrating situation, especially from the vendor who was dismissive in tone and difficult to contact.I would NEVER order anything from this vendor again."
4,small brush,the brush is about half the size of my pinky. a bit uncomfy when using it. color is a bit lighter than shown.
3,"Great artist, but needs a high quality DVD rrecording","I think that salsa videos could have a fine digital restoration process, because frankly I could not enjoy . The problem is the video corporations who can't deliver beautiful image and sound. It's a shame."
1,No chance to know...,"Waiting with much anticipation, we received thisnoteworthy disc only to discover it was NON-FUNCTIONAL!!We were dismayed, dissappointed, upset and even angry.We can only fault the vendor and their lack ofQUALITY CONTROL as regards their offerings.Buyer Beware!"
4,Cl'Che - HELP IN FINDING A UNIT,"I wanna get this album, but it extremely rare and can't be found anywhere. rare isn't even a good word, impossible would be better. if anybody out there who can sell me a cd-r of this CD it would be appreciated.i haven't heard this album except for the samples and Cl'Che is a great artist down south and all her rhymes are tight on all the songs she featured on. if you lucky to find this on sale online, you better snatch it up quick."
2,Everlast?,Everlast seems to be a bit of a misnomer--the first time I used it two of the tension bands came off. There is now way to disassemble this thing to reattach them.
4,Great Toy,"My daughter(age 5) loves this toy. The color-note learning method worked perfectly with her. Now she plays songs that she self learnt from the method everyday. Great introduction to discover the fun of playing music. Only reason I did not give 5 star was the sound. It will sound like a toy piano, not like a real piano."
5,We love the piano!,"My niece absolutely loves this little piano! I think it will be one of her favorite toys for years to come. The reason for the 4 rather than 5 stars in the durability category is that the music stand easily comes off. Other than that, it's wonderful!"
4,Beautiful Piano,This piano is so beautiful. My 19month daughter loves it since she saw it. She will bang on it for quite a while every day. At her age I don't expect she can really play some music. But she does sat there and tried to play like real. Great piano!
4,The baby seems to like it,"The sound from the piano isn't that great, but it's a toy. My 2 year old just bangs on the key and seems to love it. The look and finish of the piano and chair are nice and it was very easy to assemble."
4,Good as expected,"High gloss finish, looks very durable, build pretty solid, assembles in about 15 minutes... kids love it.The sound is a bit plinky (not sure what I was expecting from a kids toy) but the keys are tuned to each other well.Overall I can see this lasting a long while and the kids not getting bored with it."
1,"Twice defective, two times too many","The first time we ordered this piano, we waited until Christmas Eve to take it out of the box to assemble. The first thing I noticed was the bag of screws was already opened, so I'm pretty sure it was already returned. The next thing I noticed was the parts didn't match the manual that came with it. The major problem with this piano was the legs didn't match. Only 1 leg fit the piano, and the screws to the rear leg's base were missing.Returned!The 2nd piano we ordered was a bust too. The keys stuck together. When they finally would depress, they had to be manually be forced up into the rest position.Returned!Although this would have been a wonderful piano, I'm not going to take my chances with a 3rd order."
3,"Looks good, Doesn't sound good","I bought this product based on appearance, thinking it would sound more like a piano, but it really doesn't. It sounds much like one of those plastic pianos from the dolllar store... Looks nice and makes great decorative use!"
2,"Looks nice, but that's about it","This Piano looks beautiful, which made it even harder to send it back but alas, it sounds terrible and if they had put as much effort in its sound as its looks, it may have been a different story altogether. I realize its a toy piano but it really does sound bad and i couldn't justify the price."
3,"Cute to look at, but the sound is not good",I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew. It is a very pretty item but sounds awful. The keys constantly move around and the tune is really high pitched. I only recommend it if you are purely looking for a fancy toy.
2,PIANO,"This was ordered for my grandaughter for christmas, the piano was NOT PINK, it is cherry red. Not happy with the big mistake on this."
1,Broken upon delivery,"planned to give this piano as a Christmas gift to our granddaughter, arrived the day before, looked great but upon trying to play the keys, 2/3's of them were not working. I am in the process of returning this item, will update my review later to let you know how the seller or Amazon handled my problem with this item."
5,Through this book you feel that you know Dian Fossey.,"This book gives a view of not only her work, but also her personal life. Farley Mowat mixes Dian Fossey's own diary with a story of her life. It is cleverly done and very interesting to read. If you have to do a report on her, you couldn't find a better, more interesting source."
2,Warner books cheap print job.,I had read this book earlier in my life and loved it so purchased the paperback edition for a gift. It looks as if the publisher ran the original book through a copy machine--my biggest gripe being the pictues--clear and crisp in the original hardcover--in this paperback via Warner Books are cloudy and very hard to interpret--the pictures are that bad--black and white and very blurry--not one of the pictures approaches newspaper quality. The pictures have 2 colors black and white with no midtones. I will not give this book as a gift. I will order the hardcover original and give that rather than the inferior paperback published by Warner Books. I give this book 2 stars because of the wonderful story. Even tho the original by Farley Mowat is a wonderful story Warner Books has simply presented this story in the cheapest format they could produce--simply living off the author's selling power. I give Warner Books and their money making scheme 0 stars.
1,Insult to Swahili People,"This book should be dismissed as another poorly-constructed attempt to rob African people of the honor of their heritage. Middleton claims that Swahili people are actually of Asian and Arab descent, and the only photos in the book of Swahili people are Asians. You don't need to read this book to know his thesis is completely false. The main countries in which Kiswahili is spoken are Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Uganda. Tanzania is 99% AFRICAN, Kenya is 96% AFRICAN and Uganda is 99% AFRICAN. Maybe Middleton is writing about a different Swahili people- the ones that live on Mars."
4,simpall and to the point,it needs more buttons to push in boxs to say what and were .to much telling how to change the password it helped a little .
3,Great price...,I purchased this as a gift for my brother who was having a hard time finding it elsewhere. He loves it.
5,The Definitive book so far on this subject,"Tony Redmond has managed to explain the Intricacies of Exchange in both an easy and yet in-depth manner. Leading the reader through some of the more difficult areas in a readable and understandable manner whist being able to inject humor, something that all people who deal with Exchange must possess. Even the most experienced Exchange administrator will find some interesting information within these pages."
2,This book has too much fluff.,"This book is as much about Exchange as it is an advertisement for Microsoft. Tony Redmond spent about as much time explaining Exchange as he did praising Microsoft and its so-called innovations with Exchange. He touts Digital as having one of the largest Exchange deployments. Well, duh! Would Digital have deployed Exchange at all if Microsoft hadn't ported NT on Digital's Alpha chip? And how could he even name one of his chapters ""The Joy of Managing Exchange""? Any mail administrator who's been in the business knows that managing a mail system is no joy at all! The book does have some good information both theory and practice, if you can stand his constant praiseful and admiring comments about Exchange (or else have a bucket nearby)."
3,Great if you already know Exchange,"I'm A+, MCSE+Internet certified, so at this point I can tell you I know what I'm doing. I bought this book first, then went out and bought the Sybex study guide. Tony Redmond does a great job of describing Exchange issues for people that already know the basics. If you work with Exchange every day, this book is for you. If you are just starting out, and have never installed Exchange before, I'd skip this and buy Sybex."
2,Not useful for any type of day to day Admin. or Planning,"Very disappointed in this book. Very limited usefulness in any type of administration, although there is a good section on clustering Exchange. Very limited description of any type of installation procedures or setups. No help in troubleshooting or monitoring of Exchange and no information on Outlook Web Access. Great amount of coverage on routing and innerworkings of directory and connector services. Seems to be written like a college textbook with all background and little useful work experience. Not for beginning Exchange administrators but I can't imagine why an experience admin would need anything in this book."
1,Not much information in this book,"There is not a whole lot of information in this book. Even when the author is trying to present some information, it is not done in a clear and understandable way. Really disappointed."
4,Good for extended learning about Exchange mechanics.,"This book was my primary learning tool for Exchange. Redmond obviously knows this product. Unlike MCSE certification books (two of which I also read for exam prep), his is truly a real-world best practice authority (instead of limited to Microsoft's perspective). It's like having an experienced mentor on the subject. I believe it could have been written more concisely (especially the first half), and the index at the end is way too brief--otherwise five stars."
5,Tastes great,"Let's face it, taking the drippings from a turkey or chicken, adding some flour, etc...is hard to beat for great gravy. Yet, if you just want some really good tasting gravy, this will do it. Far superior to anything I've purchased in a can or glass jar."
5,Can't Beat Knorr Gravy,"I prefer homemade, but there's nothing worse than running out of gravy when people want more. Never a dissappointment. I got Chicken, Classic Brown and Pork, so I'm all set. Good buy and much cheaper in bulk than at the local stores."
1,Faulty advertisement,"The item was supposed to be a 4-packet. But, turned out to only come in 3's. Not worth the money, more expensive and then adding on shipping, etc. Better to buy at a craft store (ie, Michaels, Joanne's) in bulk."
5,A stunning gem,"I am delighted that this outstanding mezzo has gotten a showcase CD all her own. Her vocal passion and commanding presence are fully revealed- especially in the Monteverdi and Brahms pieces. Elaine Bonazzi's mezzo polishes and shines these jewels into a brilliant sheen! But I believe that she is no longer performing so if you want to hear a golden and timeless mezzo, this is one to get."
2,not a good rugby ball,"This ball does not have a good grip. It is smooth as can be, not with the nibs that are on a normal rugby ball. Futhermore, the surface began peeling after just a few weeks of play in the yard. I would not recommend this ball and I would return it if I could and purchase a Gilbert or a Union."
1,Worst product ever!!,This ball wouldn't hold air after using it once. It is very cheaply made and you will waste your money buying it. DONT. DUCK TAPE wouldn't even help!!
2,probably what you should expect for the price,"well put together ball, flies true. Supergrip is a joke, worse grip I have seen since the old leather balls and not a patch on the modern ""nubbies"". You get what you pay for. Its not terrible, its just not grippy!"
1,Terrible Quality,"The moment I opened the box, this ball looked wrong. The surface was wrinkled and the stitching was visible because the ball seemed to be separating at the seams. I immediately returned it and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Buy a Gilbert ball."
1,Disappointed,"When we received the ball it was immediately put away for Christmas morning. Christmas morning came and my son was so excited to have a rugby ball, he had just recently started to learn how to play rugby. But the ball had a hole in it and was not able to hold the air.It would be nice if you would please check items to make sure the hold the air and are actually in good condition.L. Landon"
4,Good Book to start with but you'll need more reading,"Its not bad and as a start, but I would recommend something newer than 1991. It covers the Governments Orange book very well, but I wish it had more illastrations to clearify concepts. Like just about any other computer book, if you really want to know something, one book is never enough."
2,not sure what you'll get,"I wanted two sets of these. The same set was ordered twice right off my wish list but when the second set arrived it wasn't the same brand as the first. Because they sent me a different brand the colors don't match and the rings are about quarter inch different in diameter. One set is ""Mister Babache"" the other is ""Goudurix"".If you only want three either brand is great, but if you want two matched set like I did, it kind of stinks.Delivery was prompt I just wish the product was consistent."
4,very sweet,"This is somewhat of a departure from the other ""Simply"" books. It spends much more time on the conversations between the two, and does not have as much passion (really, it has none to speak of). Despite the lack of passion (which actually made me mad at one point; why should they not have passion, just because they are ""damaged""?), this was a very sweet and satisfying love story. The pace was slow and relaxed, but it was a quick read, if that makes any sense."
4,Love this series!,I love the historical romances. This book does not disappoint. Just makes me want to get to the next one and the next.
5,I only have one complaint...,"....this book was too short!!! I read it in one day and found myself wishing there was more.I love everything about this book. The slow build of Sydnam and Anne's relationship. The surprising honesty between the two. Heck, this book made me love the Bedwyn's even more. (Sigh, I got to go back and read Slighty Dangerous again...I love Wulf and Christine.) The only thing I found lacking, which in now way took away from what a great story this is, was that I wanted more interaction between Sydnam and David. I could understand the boy's reluctance toward the big changes in his life and I would have hoped Mrs. Balogh had touched on that.That being said, I recommend this book to the author's longtime fans or new fans like myself."
3,"Eh. Not terrible. Not good, but not terrible.","For the first 200 pages, I kept thinking, surely this has got to get less grim. But no. Grim grim grim. The story lacked the humor and fun of the Bedwyn stories, yet tried to inject said humor by relying on Bedwyn quips and antics--which made the main characters seem all the more grim and humorless by comparison.I've enjoyed Balogh's work in the past, but wish I'd given this one a miss. It just wasn't a satisfying read."
3,Different twist on a love story,This is definately a different twist on a love story. Loss of good looks and a shady female past. There should be more books written without the benefits of dashing good looks and beautiful faces. Recommended reading if you are looking for a change of pace. Makes you think of what you would do if put in the same position. Love is in the eyes of the beholder.
3,Was I missing something,"Anne Jewell is a single mom and teacher in Regency England, when she is invited to the Duke of Bewcaslte home during the summer. While there she meets Sydnam Bulter,the estate manager and war vetern. Both Anne and Sydnam are struggled against their past. Anne with rape, and having a child out of wedlock and Sydnam with injuries from the war. But when these two lost souls meet it brings a passion within them.Okay I waited a long while to get ""Simply Love"" by Mary Balogh, I thought that it looked like a great book on the cover. But once I got inside of it, I was just lost. I felt that I was only getting half of the story, and was missing. Maybe if I had read all the books in the series I would have ejoyed ""Simply Love"" more, but I just don't wanted waste my money"
2,Disappointing...,"I've loved the Balogh ""Bedwyns"" series but the whole ""Simply..."" series isn't up to the originals. The character development is inadequate and the plotting is jejeune. ""Simply Love"" is a novella that has been stretched to short novel length--with the obvious problems. The inset Bedwyn scenes are just used to pad for length; there's no real drama (we know who will get together and why very very early); and the writing is neither as strongly descriptive or deeply sensual as Balogh's best writing. If you must have it, wait for the paperback. It's not so compelling that you should spring for the hardback price."
3,Simply disappointing,"Being a serious collector of Mary Balogh (I have all of her books) I was very sad that this book did not meet my expectations. When I read a romance, I want to imagine someone handsome (shallow me) and not one with half a face. This wasn't so awful that I wouldn't read further books by Mrs. Balogh. It was just o.k."
4,Same good stuff,"As a Balogh fan, I love her writing, her sense of humor and her skill in bringing characters alive. This book though, having all of that, is a little ""same old, same old"". Its a great read, its captivating and lovable, but has nothing new to offer the reader."
3,Pagitt throws the baby out with the bath water,"Pagitt asks some tough and good questions about today's preaching style, some which need to be seriously considered and answered by today's preacher.Criticisms: He builds a straw man which he calls ""speeching"" and spends a great deal of the book tearing it down. Emphasizes the priesthood of the believer while neglecting the Biblical role of the pastor/preacher. Downplays the authority and sufficiency of Scripture and its role in the believer's life. Assumes that everyone wants to take part in and will grow through progressional dialogue. Some of the Biblical and historical evidence for his proposed model of preaching is simply wrong and ill-informed. I would also entirely disagree with his purpose in preaching.I'm at least thankful that someone from the emerging church movement has engaged in a serious discussion about emerging church preaching. I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the book and walked away challenged, but not helped."
4,Starting Over,"This book is a great way to re examine methods used for preaching. Doug deconstructs many of the common thoughts and practices used in churches today to look at what the intention of the Sermon is. He provides some insight into his own method for sermons. Though easier said than done at many churches, the style that he advocates is could be a great adventure for many congregations."
4,Well done!,"Another quality BBC presentation, especially the cinematography. I must say, as much as I like David Attenborough it was refreshing to here another voice for a change. Peter Firth's delivery is a little less enthusiastic but, still respectable.Because of my interest in Yellowstone I bought this out of the blue based upon the quality of previous BBC productions. I was not disappointed and would in fact highly recommend it. The first two episodes (Winter & Summer) were the best, the last episode (Fall) was unfortunately filled with too much human content. Although I understand why, it is not what I want to see in a natural history documentary. I would rather that it was simply part of the narrative instead of taking up video content that is better used on the wildlife and landscape."
4,Puuurty goood,Just wait to feast your eyes on the red fox scene.... he goes beast mode on a shrew. anddddd 20
5,Best Yellowstone Documentary,"All other Yellowstone documentaries seem extremely dull, yet this one looks amazing and is genuinely interesting.At 43:06 in the Winter episode, an elk poops his pants in fear. Look for it."
5,A must watch nature documentary,"Excellent nature documentary, a must watch for people who love nature like me! I have never been to Yellowstone till now and this documentary pushes me to plan a trip sometime in the near future."
5,Another Great BBC Series,"I thoroughly enjoyed Yellowstone:Battle for Life. The cinematography is stunning and the narration is top-notch. At 150min you can watch all three titles in one sitting, I'm not sure why they skipped Spring though.I rented the Blu-ray from Netflix and after watching I couldn't wait to buy it."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent series of videos. It explains Yellowstone pretty well and captures amazing images.Watching this almost makes me feel like I am visiting Yellowstone again.I would say this is a must have for anyone interested in Yellowstone.
2,Content somewhat simplistic but redeemed by practical forms,"This book lacks any real depth and the author seems to be talking down to the reader. However, the forms are practical and can be put to good use by beginners and those already established."
5,Amazing insight and sound guidance!!!,"Truly insightful and sound guidance that set me free from the chains (early childhood trauma) that bound me. I purchased this book because, believe it or not, it called to me. I was wearing thin from the rigid ""rules for life"" that I was conditioned to believe were the ""gold standard"". After reading this book, I literally felt the heavy chains fall free, and I walked away, empowered and alive,no longer under their spell. I have since purchased this book for people that I love and sensed were hypercritical of life for the same unspoken reasons that afflicted me. To the authors: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!!!"
4,The Internet as a vehicle to finding our souls again!,"Grey proposes that the Internet is serving a role in the evolution of human consciousness, a perspective I haven't heard from anyone else and one that I may never have considered. I can now envision the positive role it plays as we humans eventually rediscover our souls and ultimately transcend our present crises. His book has changed the way I look at the Web forever."
3,Read this book before you leave home.,This is an amusing book that has lots of ideas. This book needs to be read before you leave home. In fact I would recommend reading it if you are just thinking of leaving your wife.
1,Good to be single!,"I'm really glad I'm a single girl after reading a book like this. It just goes to show, that many times a woman who invests herself, her time and her life to a man will often end up with men like the authors of this book, who take this dirty route in dealing with their wives for their years of companionship and help. If a woman can invest the same amount of time in working on her own career and life that she did supporting jerks like this in theirs, she could have her own life, her peace of mind and her own assets in tact and not have to worry. It's good to be single girls!"
2,TELEPHONE,"The phone was delivered on a timely basis. We've had this phone in the past and were happy to be able to find another one as our old one ""died""."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"Please don't waste your money! I bought this phone and it didn't work. The static was so bad that I couldn't hear anything. There's a button to press to change the channl to get a ""better sound"" but that didn't do anything and sometimes it made it worse. Please, please, don't waste your money."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"Here were my criteria for a new phone: cordless with user-friendly answering machine, good reception in multi-unit apartment building, readable Caller ID display, backlit keypad and display, good battery life, speakerphone, and attractive, ergonomic design.<br /><br />This phone passes swimmingly on all counts. I'm surprised by the negative reviews of this phone as I find it to be one of the best on the market in its price range. (Previous to this phone I bought a GE and was disappointed by its quality and design. I don't remember the model number, but it was comparably priced.)<br /><br />I use another Panasonic cordless phone that I bought several years ago (KX-TC1450B). Apart from replacing the battery about a year ago, it works great. So I trust in the durability of Panasonic phones.<br /><br />For the reviewer who didn't know how to switch back from the speakerphone to the handset, just hit the ""Talk"" button. Cheers!<br />"
2,Think twice,"I bought this phone and returned it within two days. The main problem was the background noise. People could hear me well, but I had to hear them through the constant background noise. Reception was not that good too. I had to leave the base not lot longer than 50 feet to have reception problems."
5,Despite some negative reviews I ordered it anyway...,"And I'm glad I did. It is perfect for our needs and a good price. It works fabulously in our multi-apartment building (no inteference) in the city. A wealth of features (love the speakerphone and address book which is like a cell phone!), good battery life and a nice compact design. Not sure what everyone is complaining about. One thing though, haven't figured out how to turn off the speakerphone if I want to go back to just talking into the receiver."
1,Very bad experience,"I just bought a KX-TG 2224W afew days ago, from a chainstore.It sounds quite noisy and unclear.I can not believe my ""ear"", because I bought a 2.4GHz 27930GE7 at the same time, which just works perfectly clear and good."
1,WORST PHONE ON THE MARKET,"This is the worst cordless phone I have EVER purchased. Two new batteries over the last three months. Will not hold charge. Goes dead without warning. Placed into charger and still will not charge, even with new battery, over one ""bar"" on the charge scale.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,What a let down,"I previously owned a Panasonic phone very similar to this model. It was black and I had it for about 4 years. It worked wonderfully the entire time. I guess it finally wore out and so I decided that I would buy another just like it. I bought this model thinking it would be just as good. Was I wrong. I had some of the same problems that others had. It would beep in the middle of a conversation and then cut out. I would have to ask the person to repeat what they said because I couldn't hear them. I also had trouble with the &quot;tin can&quot; sound. Several times I would call someone and it would be very hard to hear them and there would be a static sound in the background. I would hang up and call back and it would be better. I ended up returning this phone and trying the cheaper model thinking it would be more like the original. This one was no good either. I returned the second model and went for another brand. We'll see how this goes. Very disappointed, Panasonic!"
4,Very Good Phone,Had the Motorola before. Piece of junk. Went back to the old reliable Panasonic. Always excellent quality for the money. This phone is no exception.
4,Cordless handset-speakerphones are the way to go,"I like this cordless mostly for the speakerphone handset. If I'm in some company or agency's automated phone system and am waiting for an operator (Quote: your average wait time is 9 minutes Unquote + muzak), I don't want to have to keep my ear to the handset, do you? Just punch the speaker button on the handset and set it down near you and go about your business. When the operator comes on, say something, hit the button to put it back on non-speakerphone status and talk normally. Great feature."
2,do not buy,i thought panasonic was a good brand. but i thought rong.first of all the voice enhancer makes who ever your talking to sound completly different. second you prity much have to be in the same room as the base to have a cristal clear conversation. that makes me made the most. but outher wise it is great phone.
1,Would NOT recommend to anybody.,"I thought this phone would be really nice considering it's by Panasonic -- it's NOT!! It has a voice enhancer (VE) which I thought would be great, but it makes the person you're talking with echo (if it's on). If the VE is off then you can hear yourself echoing in the telephone. The sound is always bad and it doesn't ever find a clear channel so it's always got static."
2,No Customer Service,If you live in the US I suggest that you not buy anything from Dension. I bought a Dension icelink a few months ago. When it stopped working I contacted their Customer Service for assistance exchanging the product. They've done nothing but ignore me. Apparently there is no support for the Dension products in the US any longer.
5,Uniform Romeo fun peek at some Navy life and technology,Mr. Libby provides a fun peek at some of Navy life and technology. His subtle humor is based on his life experiences with helicopters and a flying career.
5,It's tight,The Gap Band is blazing on this disc.the grooves are still sounding crisp&Charlie Wilson hasn't Lost a thing.this is what real R-N-B should sound like.very Tight&a Must have.cuz back in the day you weren't nothing unless you could take it to the stage.and the Gap Band could then&now.
3,Not great.,"The romance was hard to buy. I never felt the two connect, and as another reviewer said, when Dante wasn't running into walls, her other bodyguards were stammering around. I never bought into the seriousness of her plight, and the fact that I didn't seen Dante or the other characters as particularly serious, made her kidnapping/troubles seem...tame."
2,In enemy hands,Not as good as I thought it would be or as it could have been...something wwas off about the writing for me....
3,Hard-hitting '80s rock album,"1988's Infectious was the second album from American hard rockers Eric Steel. The band played uncomplicated, not over the top hard rock along the lines of Quiet Riot and maybe Kix. It's not glammy enough to put them with Poison and the like, and never really passes into metal territory. Infectious is just a solid, workmanlike bar rock album. It's decent stuff, but not as dynamic and attention-getting as the hair metal bands.The band issued one more album (1992'sBack for More) before calling it quits. Given the music scene at the time, I can hardly blame them. This band would not have fit in with all that angst and flannel. Infectious is a perfectly solid album, but it's pretty far from essential. If you're a serious `80s rock fan (I am) and run across a cheap used copy (I did), by all means pick it up.I have to ask though, what kind of band name is Eric Steel if there's no one by that name in the band?"
2,I can not pass 2-10 level,"I am doing this level for 2 days, almost perfectly, but still cannot pass, what will happen in last level."
4,Diner Dash is challenging,"Good game and fun to play. I had a little trouble figuring out some of the ""chaining"" to get more points, but this game lets you play the same level over and over until you finally get it. Found a couple of little glitches in the software where the game starts going a little crazy and doesn't work properly, but once I closed it out and got back in it was fine."
4,Fun to play,This game is fun. It gets a lot more challenging as you grt further into the game. I played this for free on zone at msn several months ago and thought it was super easy. But when i bought it at tj max for 7.00 it was a lot more challenging then the trial version.
4,I got this game for FREE!,"Hey everyone,I used a coupon code on Big Fish Games and got this game for free!It is very fun, and helps with multitasking (I thought I was good at it until this game :P I can play jazz or classical guitar while reading the music, and also eat during pauses, and hold a conversation...but this game seriously lol...it gets hard!).I like that this game allows you to focus, but doesn't strain you. I also like the cute expressions the characters make, and the length each level lasts.I love most everything about this game, so my only complaints are that the game doesn't give a very good definition of what chaining is. Also, if the main character picks up a beverage or tray of food AS WELL AS dirty dishes, and puts those dirty dishes away...the food or drink is also thrown away. Also, this game gets really hard (I heard people saying Ninja Gaiden is a hard game series, but I didn't find it very difficult...but this game IS).This is a very good game, and I recommend it!"
4,ITS A REALLY FUN GAME!!,I love this game!! I becomes faster and harder once you get to the higher levels but other than that its a really fun game!! Im never going to become a waitress!!!!=+Dhaha
1,CREDIBILTY IS THROWN OUT THE DOOR,Suprisingly this film moves at a good pace and the acting is pretty good as well. Okay it is a ghost story - even that's okay. The real problem is the set. Here we have a warehouse that was abandoned more than 20 years ago yet the former manager's office looks untouched in all those years. Only a few cobwebs ; litle dust; the electricity still works ( who paid the bills?); the lights / fridge/ VCR/ tv all are in perfect working order after such a long time.Surely the family would have removed them.Even the safe was left behind-surely someone would have been curious as to what was in it. Whoever gave this film 5 stars must have been connected to the making of the film- a common practice on this site.
2,"corny, lame, not so good movie","this movie was horribly lame and corny. the ghosts looked awful. the sound was not that great.the storyline was basically good (thiefs in a warehouse, get murdered, girl walks off with their money) but they did a horrible job of making it into a movie."
2,Disappointing! Much too overrated.,"I bought this book and others by new authors based on the reviews on Amazon. I am really disappointed with this one. Am I reading a different book? I find the story boring and the characters bland. It took me on and off a week to struggle through it.I don't mean to be discouraging but if it's a matter of taste, then I'd better stick to Mary Balogh, Joan Wolf, Elizabeth Mansfield, Stephanie Laurens, Judith McNaught, Paula Marshall, Johanna Lindsey , Brenda Joyce and Elizabeth Lowell ...etc."
3,Needed more clear descriptions.,"While the story and character development is extremely good, I found that the book has very poor descriptions and sometimes missing a good transition from one scene to the next. Overall the book is enjoyable and the ending makes up for the slow start."
2,"Train wreck, but at least Isla Fisher looks cute","I was so excited when I heard Confession of a Shopaholic was going to be a movie because I absolutely love the books. Yes, the books are incredibly stupid, but I still think they're cute and funny.Well, I missed the movie in theaters and kind of forgot about it until I was flipping through my on-demand listings tonight (yes, 2 years later!). I knew from the movie trailer/commercials that it was going to be different (ie, Becky & co being American, set in NY, etc), but wow, I had no idea how different the movie would be. I feel like the differences really ruined the movie too. In the movie, Luke is a total schlub, works for a magazine, and there's that whole fashion magazine thing. None of that happens in the books, nor do Suzy and Tarkie get married until later. It was a total train wreck.Do yourself a favor and read the books instead!"
5,Fabulous darling!!!,"Great movie that pits american materialism against the british stiff upper lip. Shows the emptiness of materialism and it's futility ~ that the almighty buck can buy you a bag, a nose, a man/woman, a house & an island but still leave you searching ~ that the outer cannot satisfy the inner yearning for truth, justice, decency and love. Shows that long-term gratification can only come from growing up on the inside not the outside. Bravo!"
1,If You Liked The Devil Wears Prada...,"Then you'll hate this movie.I've read neither of the books on which these movies are based, so that is NOT factored into my review.My initial draw to this movie was due to the fact that I thought it MIGHT be a bit like Devil Wears Prada...a comedic insight to a NY fashion focused life.It was anything but.The acting was generally horrid, whatever elements of the plot that could have been funny fell totally flat...this is an instance where ALL of the funny scenes were shown in the trailer with nothing left over for the movie.The only part of the movie that I found 'cute' was the friendship between the main character and her best friend.I was extremely disappointed in the lack of entertainment value of this movie all around and honestly blame the director and screenwriter for screwing this up. Maybe throw some blame the actors ways as well.What a shame...it could have been quite funny."
2,needed an actual script,"This movie should have worked but the writing was so lame it just failed on so many levels. Given the stellar supporting cast (John Lithgow, SNL's Fred Armisen, John Goodman, Joan Cusack, Airplane's Julie Hagerty and even the usually mannish Kristin Scott Thomas), even they cannot save this disaster.One great failing is the lead male role as Hugh Dancy just has no screen appeal at all. He just seems ""there""--that's all. There's no sense of comedic timing or even of how to play a romantic lead. Isla Fisher is her usual effervescent self but maybe she has just rehashed that persona once too much. Her BFF in the movie, Krysten Ritter, just seems like a poor woman's Anne Hathaway.Also, this DVD version gives you only deleted scenes and extremely boring unfunny outtakes. Not that I was expecting much from a ""so what!?"" movie."
2,I really wanted to like it. . .,"I really wanted to like this film because I like Isla Fisher as well as some of the supporting cast members however, it was a really disappointing comedy! I thought her acting was pretty horrible (which was surprising because she was so funny in Wedding Crashers) and the plot was just ridiculous! It was just an all around bad film! Save your time and go see The Proposal which was a funny comedy with great acting!"
1,Awful in every way,"Mediocre, predictable, cliched, you get the point. Were I in a movie theater, I would have walked out. One of the worst of all time. Do not buy, rent, or watch."
3,Amazingly average.,"Confessions of a Shopaholic is a romantic comedy that is fun but not very memorable. Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy keep this movie above float, barely. The writing, premise, and character development is weak and timid. I liked this movie but I didn't love it and the whole thing about ""the girl with the green scarf"" gets annoying after awhile. Just a so-so chick flick, the true star of Confessions... is the gorgeous fashion of course."
2,Cute but dull,"Nothing here rings remotely realistic. This is pure chick flick fantasy. Break out the Hershy bars. Guys may be bored. I know I was. The star is very small and cute, though. Women watch. Guys beware."
4,Shop-o,"Bought this for my wife for Valentines Day. One of her favorite movies. I quite liked it too. And it PG to boot! Great story line and makes its point, in a very funny and entertaining way."
2,disappointing puff of air,"The thing that made this character different, in the book, was her basic sweet goodness which was so interestingly and hilariously coupled with all those faults. The movie changed that and in doing so, changed everything. And then it became just a movie about a silly, thoughtless girl who runs through life, and money, as if nothing had any consequences and THE most important thing was her next purchase. I like Isla Fisher and thought it would be more interesting but it just seemed like a different version of The Devil Wears Prada. And I mean that in a bad way."
2,Not the entertainment I was expecting,"I am a romantic comedy loyalist. Normally, I love films like this. My library is packed with 'em! However, this movie left me wanting. Aside from Isla Fisher being a sweetheart and Hugh Dancy being a hottie, I found that it got quite dry in the middle and continued through the end. I just really don't think anyone should waste their money on this film! The plot was uninteresting and predictable, with little to no laughs."
1,Confessions of a Shopaholic,I used this video as part of my Consumer Economics class to talk about the problems of using a credit card inapproriately. My students loved it. It was very high interest and entertaining.
4,Light and funny,"I watched this movie on dvd and really enjoyed it...actually I was watching it on my daughter's computer,and became so engrossed that I almost burnt her house down!!!I had forgotten that I had something cooking on the stove..However after the rather long interruption whilst cleaning the smoke from the house and a very black saucepan,I continued to watch the movie.It is a light offering yet funny and charming,The lead actors were convincing and although the story was far fetched,I had a good time.Isla Fisher is just gorgeous and Hugh Dancy is handsome...what more can you ask for????"
2,Lameness outweighed the humor,Thought movie would be a little average but turned it had many lame parts. Glad I didn't spend $27 on the blu ray dvd. Glad I just borrowed it from a friend. I love shopping and could relate with some of the parts but still sucked =/.
4,Fun chick flick with a serious under message,"Having at times indulged in retail therapy, I could sympathize with the character who had her insides mixed up with her outsides. Had some cringeworthy moments and some laugh-out-loud moments.... very enjoyable."
1,Avoid,"This was quite a disappointment. Take the typical I know nothing about a complex business but thus become a genius attitude and usually it cannot fail to provide some great laughs. However this is a real failure. It is embarrassing and the acting is bad, especially Isla Fisher."
1,Dreadful,"The screenwriter and director should be put against a wall and shot! This movie was certainly not funny. I managed to give it one sstar only because it got the two names - Becky and Brandon - correct. The rest of the movie had nothing at all to do with the book, which was a great read. Just terrible."
1,Boring,"I never thought this would be such a boring comedy; to the point of putting me to sleep after its first thirty or forty minutes.It has such an unbelievable poor plot, as well as unfunny gags, that it's almost impossible to get at least one laugh from it."
2,Predictable fluff,My husband is a good sport and will watch a good chick flick. He left this one after 5 minutes. It could have been good if the script was better written and the plot had more meat to it. I felt sorry for the actors. My 20-something daughter and I thought is was pretty sappy and shallow.
3,Very different from the books..,"This is the kind of movie you just watch once. I loved the books, which prompted me to watch this. Books are much better."
1,Not good,Not good. Pretty dumb and surface level and just tries to make you feel good and entertained. Not very artful at all. But does have some redeeming messages about materialism and self absorption.
2,Books are MUCH better!,"I have loved the shopaholic series since they first came out, and I was excited each time there was a new book added. The books are funny, actually hilarious!! You can read all her funny letters to bill collectors. I guess if you never read the books, you may really enjoy the movie. If you haven't read the books, go and get them and read them from the beginning."
4,Fun movie,"At a solid 3.5 stars, I liked this movie. I have never read the book, so I cannot judge the movie against its literary form. But by itself, it was a fun movie. There were a lot of funny bits and lines in here, and if this movie isn't what some would consider highbrow, it isn't lowbrow either, and it was amusing and enjoyable.There's some practical advice to be found in this movie, and a good amount of humor as well. I didn't feel it was quite good enough for a four, but it was definitely better than a 3. Like I said, I don't have the book to judge this against, but from the reviews, I probably should read the book.Overall, a good chick flick to watch with friends."
3,Eh.,"The movie is cute, but if you read the book, and expect to see that story come to life, you will be disappointed. It doesn't really follow the same story line. And while I did laugh out loud at a few parts, Isla Fisher didn't do it for me as Rebecca Bloomwood."
2,Was this for real?,"If air was visable it would be this movie. It had it's cute moments, funny moments, sweet moments and by the formula heart warming moments. However, it also contained absolutely no substance what so ever."
1,A rather embarrassing 'formula' movie,"To begin, I'm a man and it would seem pretty obvious I'm not the target audience for this movie. I also haven't read the book(s) it's based on.I decided to compare this movie (watched on DVD) with 'The Devil Wears Prada', which seemed to me to have the same combination of girl appeal, comedy, romance, and a touch of drama. I enjoyed 'Prada' but 'Confessions' was a really poor 'wannabe' in comparison. There were times when I had to leave the room as they telegraphed the embarrassing comedy moment far in advance. Weak character development and desperate struggling to get from one set piece to another made this movie a chore to watch. I liked the trailer though. Aren't there many more, better, movies like this, where the troubled girl sorts out her life, gets the job and man of her dreams and lives happily ever after?"
3,The movie could have been better,"The movie was trying to cover to much. It was trying to be a comedy, it was trying to be a recovery movie for shipping addiction, it was a love movie and it was a movie about politics. I just think this movie was good but I wish they would have really thought about this one and put a little more effort into it to make it a movi you could watch over and over. If they would have focused more on the comedy of the movie and a shopper's addiction then I think the movie would have been better. It just had too many themes that over crowded each other and therefore, you just got bored with the movie. At the end it did pick up and was really good again but after looking at the movie I immediately sold it back. And movies should make you want to keep them. It was watchable but it was not keepable."
4,Fun!,"This movie was a lot of fun to watch! We had a group of people and we were trying to pick out a movie that we would all enjoy. When you have different types of people all watching a movie together, it is hard to pick one that everyone can enjoy. This movie definitely fit the bill. Everyone really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this movie!!!"
2,"Isla Fisher, I love you, but I didn't like the movie.","I really thought this movie was going to be at least pretty good for me, but sadly, I was disappointed. I have read all the Shopaholic books, many times, and loved them all. The movie was more of an ""inspired by the Shopaholic series"", as opposed to a ""based on the Shopaholic series""; there were some similarities, but overall the movie is not like the books at all.Isla Fisher WAS really good in this movie, and I hope she begins to get a couple more movies where she is a leading lady. Naturally funny, Isla pulls off the Becky Bloomwood character very well. There were parts of this movie where I caught myself smiling, but most jokes I thought were cliche or I have seen them done in other movies.All in all, Isla, still love you, but I still don't like this movie."
2,Very little from the book,"I wanted to watch the movie after starting reading the book Confession of a Shopoholic. Unfortunately, like any other adoptation, the movie has little common with the book. Too much changes and deviations. The Becky - is not how I pictured her reading the book. I regret to pay $2 for wasted hour."
5,There is a baby Margaret Cho cameo in this movie that is a MUST - SEE,Adorable! This movie is very easy to watch and the lead actress is very smart and quick so you may find yourself choking on something that looks smooth and light but is actually sly and interesting. Her outfits are intentionally terrible because NYC is all about sample sales - no one buys designer clothing in anything but black but inexplicably bright Irish green and orange versions with fancy labels always end up on third markdown racks. Who decides to do this to ordinary female office workers?
3,"Reasonably entertaining, Sometimes silly is not a bad thing!","I enjoyed this movie, simply because you get exactly what is promised; pure silliness and some funny jokes that you might not remember later but you end the movie with a smile. Isla Fisher is as funny and cute as always. True, some typical lameness does exist in the movie, but with the current huge glut of empty movies, this movie stands out."
3,"Pleasant, mildly amusing","As a fan of the books, which are set in England, I avoided this movie for quite a while. When I did watch it (for a couple of bucks on my computer, via Amazon instant view), I found it pleasant enough. I imagine those not familiar with the books would enjoy it more. Isla Fisher is a talented young actress and deserves better than so-so versions of pop lit. But it was an okay way to spend a rainy afternoon."
3,Shopaholic meets Isla Fisher,"I am a fan of the 3 first shopaholic books (after that they get redundant w/ Becky never really learning to stop spending so dang much). Sophia Kinsella's Rebecca ""Becky"" Bloomwood is a comedic take on a woman with an obsessive need to buy designer clothes. This of course puts her into a crazy amount of debt to creditors.Isla did make this movie funny. But also at times a little cheesy. Becky was still loveable though. Hugh Dancy was just so yummy in this. He played the ideal Luke Brandon. Joan Cusack and John Lithgow added humor as Becky's parents.I own this movie and still watch it from time and again. This movie is a good cute romance comedy. But I just felt it wasn't as good as Sophia's books."
5,Hilarious!!!,I love this film! it's really funny! This girl is just crazy on spending cash and things! he gets what's coming at her! Good movie for a girls night!
2,"I'm all for corny movies, but this was too much!","I love, love, love the Shopaholic series, but I did NOT love the movie! I guess it was a sort of combination of Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, but it was too loosely based on the books to have any of the appeal of the actual series. I don't even know where to start with the discrepancies. I understand that certain liberties must be taken when turning a book into a movie, but this one just fell flat.I also thought that if I hadn't read the books, I really would have had no idea what the heck was going on in the movie. It all just seemed so loosey-goosey tied together into a giant mess. Don't get me wrong, I love Isla Fischer, and I think she could have been great as Becky Bloomwood if the movie had followed the books more closely.I'm all for corny chick flicks, but this one just didn't do it for me. Love the books though - and I'd recommend reading those instead of wasting 2 hours of your life with this flick."
1,WISH I COULD RATE LESS THAN ONE STAR,"What a poor trick! This movie completely ruins the wonderful series of shopaholic story. Again, this cheap movie simply trashes the books! Isala fisher and Lelie Bibb didin't bring up any bit of characters of Becky and Luke out of the books. In stead, they both are nothing but acting like 2 idiots in the film. Or, should we blame P.J. Hogan??"
2,Disappointing,"Thankfully I read the books before watching the movie. The books are GREAT -all 5 of them- but the movie is so disappointing, it does no justice at all to the books. I will probably throw my dvd copy to the bin, I feel ashamed to even offer it to someone, whereas I highly recommend all 5 books and any other book by this author, they are great!"
1,So Disappointing,"I think Isla Fisher is adorable. This movie, on the other hand, was not. There was no chemistry between the main characters and I couldn't wait for the film to be over. Isla is a wonderful comedic actress and the poor script did not allow her to showcase her talents. Stay away!"
2,Tried Too Hard...,"I am a big fan of the 'Shopaholic' books. So I was very excited to hear they were making a movie based on the book series. However, i feel that the film tried too hard to condense the highlights of the first two books into this film. I don't think enough time was spent developing the characters of Rebecca Bloomwood and Luke Brandon. The film didn't flow nicely the way the books did. I feel they would have done better if they focussed on one book and did a faithful adaptation. Since they insisted on having the movie take place in New York then they should have focussed more on the second book in the series, 'Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.'While the script wasn't great, Isla Fisher was cute and Hugh Dancy was perfectly cast as Luke Brandon. This film is a case where the talent was great, but the story was not."
1,This movie is the worse,"Having previously read the book, I was really looking forward to the movie. Unfortunately, the movie is nothing like the book and a huge disappointment. The story line is all over the place, it is based out of New York instead of London, and the fashions in the movie sucked. If you have read the book already, don't bother with the movie, you will be disappointed"
4,Works well to protect and is a good value,Works well to protect and is a good value and comes in pretty colors.
4,Spinning wheels gets you noticed...,Got these shoes a week ago and were surprised to see the wheels do spin as you walk. It uses air pressure so the harder you hit the surface the faster the wheels will spin. The wheels are modeled after the custom vehicle mags that spin even when the vehicle is at a stop. This is a novelty shoe and after a while will get old. This shoe would be great for kids. The only problems I have are with size vs color. The colors I want but not in the size I want and vise versa. A very limit selection of ladies sizes. I developed a squeak in my left shoe that's becoming annoying. With moving parts in the shoes this is going to happen. Still I'm happy with my selection and got a great deal on them considering their original price.
4,youth book,It is worth reading all 6 books as there is a very satisfying ending - don't give up yet.
4,Beginners Start Here!,"A new beginners video with a seemingly new face to the bellydance scene, yet Alexandra's been teaching in the Greater Seattle area for over 12 years and dancing for over 24 years! Perfect for someone without any knowledge of bellydance and would like to practice in their home before joining a class or for additional practice of your base bellydancing moves you already know.Video teaches: isolations, basic moves like hip lifts and hip drops, Egyptian walk, basic hips, the rock step, arm movements and more. AND it covers a full warm up streches and cool down stretches as well as teaching proper posture!"
4,No Nonsense approach to study skills,"This is a direct, no nonsense approach to developing study skills. It is quick, yet includes the essential ingredients to becoming an effective learner. It has my recommendation!"
3,"Great writing style, but lacking in solid insightful info.","In this book, an Iranian aristocrat tells a tale of his memories of Iran's turbulent development years in 20th century. The book is first and foremost a selective story of the author's experiences rather than an insightful look at Iran's government and politics. It is very selective and subjective in presenting events as to support the author's point of view and conclusions. The book by itself does not provide necessary historic background to understand the political events discussed and hence one should already have a good knowledge of Iran' s political history to be able to digest the information and viewpoints provided in Blood & Oil. This book does provide a good insight into Iranian aristocratic life under the Shahs and provides one insider's view of historic events in the oil boom years. The bardic writing style used is a delight to read and proves the prowess of the authors in story telling."
4,The Prince of Storytelling,"Where, oh post-modern America, are you going to find a true tale of royalty and restoration like this? Nowhere, but from the prince himself, Manucher Farman-Farmaian, who sweeps us up in luxuriant confidentiality, whisking us on a gallop through a forgotten era, Shiites and communists hot on our trail. So what if he was less than streetwise as dissent gathered like storm clouds? I wanted to see the glory that was Iran--not the darkness descending on it. I wanted to meet the inner sanctum of the Pahlavi dynasty and the relics of Farmaian's own kingly clan. Moreso, I wanted to know that this likable bon vivant escaped the senseless butchery of Khomenei's hoodlums and hangers-on. And when he does, I feel as if we've both escaped. Captivatingly written. I'd read whatever this wise man had to share, about the old life or the new."
3,An Aristocrats View of Life in the Imperial Iran,"The author was a previleged and lucky child as he was born into a rich family in Iran and got all the usual perks that came with it. His memoirs regarding historical events in Iran are extremely subjective and the author has not bothered at all even to show a pretense of objectivity. This is not a book for a reader seeking historical knowledge about Iran but it is valuable for a more knowledgable reader to see the how life in Shah's Iran looked from the vantage view of a high official of that regime. For the knowledgable reader who actually knows what was life in Imperial Iran was like, the author provides a clear example of the total ignorance of ruling elite about the internal situation of Iran. The book also gives a clear indication of the ""inferiority complex"" that had inflicted the Iranian ruling elite where they had total disdain for Iranians and considered everything Western superior."
3,Apologist,"Historical review of British involvement is fascinating reading, especially the parts concerning the partnership disputes with the Persian government.Analysis of political events is shallow particularly from an ""insider"". Reads more like an apologist making excuses for the Shah. Mostly attributes the unpopularity of the Shah to incompetent government and glosses over the terrible human rights abuses widely reported by Amnesty International on brutal treatment of political opponents of the Shah.What is left out of this book would make for great reading. Author seems to have a very selective memory and appears to have quite the ego. Claims to be involved in too many critical events in recent Iranian history and always portrays himself as correctly predicting course of events."
2,shoddy,"The Cd is missing thet last 2 songs on side 2. Gone-nowhere. I love the old, JB vinyl version. Love all JB's stuff, anyway he does it, but these folks are ripping us off. Don't buy it."
3,James Brown Live At The Holiday Inn Lobby!,"Take a very excellent Jazz trio and have the Godfather himself along with Marva Whitney for moral support and you have james Brown Live at the Holiday Inn Hotel Lobby. I speak as a true fan of James Brown and I have heard most of his various jazz reditions of standard songs but this is an example of James being totally out of his element. A jazz man, he ain't. This music is not even suitable for Macy's elevator. He never gave up his day job(night job) and thats good. Without Maceo, Jabo and the band, James Brown is a lost ball in tall weeds. 3 stars just because he is James Brown."
3,Tha Jazzy Side Of The Godfather.,This is an incredible jazz album put out by Verve records. I didn't think it'd turn out to be this great as I've never had a copy of the vinyl of this one. To all who are familiar with James Brown and do not dislike jazz--you will LOVE this. Not one song is skippable. The jazz version of 'Cold Sweat' on here is amazing.Notable Tracks:SunnyCold SweatTime After TimeAll The Way
2,Glad I don't have bed bugs!,"The thing had a hole near one of the seams- right out of the package! Then a couple of weeks later I found another small hole. This one was probably torn in it by me, but still... it doesn't seem like a very durable product. If I had bedbugs, I'd be upset because they would be able to crawl through the holes. But as a lining for your mattress, this would work just fine."
3,Great Product,"This was purchased for the company I work for, which runs group homes for developmentally disabled adults. This was far better than we have been able to purchase in the area."
3,Works!,"It is a little difficult to put on. Since it covers the entire mattress, top and bottom. But once on, it works as it should!"
1,another waste of money,"Ordered two of these for my kid's bunk beds. The zipper is useless. The seam gave away like it was held together with rubber cement. On both sheets, as I attempted to zip them up (the 1st time), the zipper completely separated. I was being as gentle as I could.Also, these things tear like a balloon that's been left out in the sun. The mattress barely made contact with the frame as I was putting back in place. It ripped like tissue paper.I've bought sheets just like this in the past and had the same experience. I was hoping the 1st time was a fluke. There's got to be something better than this out there."
1,Don'T Buy,"bought one as a spare. Didn't open it for weeks after we had it. When we finally opened it, there was a giant hole in one of the seams & it was too late to return. avoid it."
3,not great,"Arrived as advertised, however as I was putting this on the mattress for the first time, the zipper ripped away from the cover itself. It's still usable, but disappointed it started to fall apart on first use. It's not worth the hassle to return it, so I'll be using it until it does fall apart. Works ok for now, but not great quality."
5,NuLife Moss Killer Works,"This fertilizer has an immediate effect - the moss will look black within 24hrs.Within a couple of weeks it will melt down into the ground and the grass will begin to reassert itself.Depending on how week the grass is, you may need to reseed as well"
2,Lots of Flash but lacks Subtlety,"I must have been blown away by a song on late-night radio that features Margolis' soaring voice. But, after several listens, Heart & Soul hasn't lived up to its title - yet. Maybe after a few more listens, because it show promise. Kitty is compared at times to Betty Carter, but Carter is far more imaginable and original. As mentioned, I could change my mind ... some of Live in San Francisco is really good."
2,MAYBE YOU JUST HAD TO BE THERE,"I have all Kitty's previous releases and love them, but with this one I just feel she is trying way to hard....she goes all over the place and I cant help but feel that she looses the essence of the songs.....if I want Betty carter I listen to her same with Sarah or Ella...I wanted to hear Kitty again but alas i just hear shades of the others before her...."
3,Good starter camera for medium format photography,"This camera was a birthday gift and I've been using it for nearly six months without any problems. It's very basic -- no metering, awkward viewfinder and focusing. The build quality is somewhat questionable -- it's still in one piece but after a week of ownership I notice some of the cover material started to peel away.One can only shoot 120 format, so a user can have only 12 shots per roll. Be aware that this film format can be pricey and in some places difficult to have processed. But it is a fun camera and it's neat to take pictures in the larger format."
2,"Not bad for entry, but lacking in some features.","The fact that this camera is still being made during the onslaught of digital tech is a feat in itself, and is a viable alternative to all the bells and whistles of your basic 3,4 or 5 megapixel camera. The quality of the lens is average and certainly useable, but it would be even better if you could change lenses on the fly to ones of different focal lengths ,such as a 110mm or 40mm to give you more options. Also I would like to see the option to change from 120 to 220 format in case I want to shoot more pics per roll. This is the case for Mamiya cameras of similar design. If my budget was so tight that I couldn't afford the used $300 Mamiya and I didn't want to deal with digital hassles, this Seagull GC-109 would definately be in the running for my camera dollars."
1,not happy,My product did not work right out of the box. The shutter release was broke. I will never buy on line again. I do not no how I will recoop my lost.I loaded the film to shoot a picture and the shutter pushed in and did not release.
3,Disappointing quality of illustrations,The subject matter was intrinsically interesting but Faraday's scientific achievements were understated. Cosidering that the author has access to all Faraday's notebooks very little of the pioneer's thinking was addressed. The illustrations were sparse and of such poor quality that some of the manuscripts reproduced were illegible..
2,Doesnt work with my phone,"I followed the instructions and the only thing that it does do, I can see who calls me and when but that is all the rest of the things is says in the instruction manual it does not do. I kept because it was not worth the price of s&H to send it back or I would have. It good for a caller ID and that is ALL."
3,You get what you pay for,"For the price, its not a bad product. We bought 3 for our business office. It's been less than a month, and one of the three no longer works as it should. In fact, it was causing problems with our phone line. The other two work fine, but for a piece of equipment that is designed solely to nab the phone number of whoever is calling, its kind of bulky and can take up too much room if desk space is already a little tight. However, it does have more features than some of the others I looked at. Just as with anything, weigh the pros and cons..."
1,Incompatibility with my phone system,"Was not compatible with phone system in my home, so I had to return it. It should have been described better in Amazon literature..."
3,Overcomplicated,This caller ID is quite bulky. It requires electrical power and a battery back up. It is quite overcomplicated as well. Try another.
1,This caller ID is very hard to read,"If I had known how bad this caller ID is I would not even pay the shipping charge, even if it was free."
5,A Must Have,I now own both of Robert Wolgemuth's books (see Daddy@Work also) and find them indespinsible! I have given at least four to five copies as gifts to new fathrs of daughters that I know. A great resource for raising a daughter when..let's face it...most men are scared to death of raising a little girl.
5,"If you're a father with a young daughter, get this book!","When I read the introduction to this book, my first thought was, ""I want with my daughter what he has with his daughters."" By focusing on seven areas for ""building a complete daughter,"" the author gives practical advice and terrific anecdotes to guide a father in the unique aspects of raising a girl.I especially liked the chapter on communication. This seems like the key to building a great father-daughter relationship and helping your girl communicate well with others.From discipline to faith to laughter, the author covers the most important aspects of nurturing the early life of your daughter.A great, useful, and easy read."
2,Loses Point of title of Book,"I chose this book from a list of books from Focus on the Family. The book seemed to have some good concepts, but failed to deliver its message. The author seemed to use a lot of stories from his life, but the book failed to make the connection of raising a daughter. I have a 4 year old daughter and really did not get much from reading this book. My expectations of what I wanted to get from this book were high, but were never met."
4,Crank it up!,"I can describe this ""lost"" e.p. in one word: bitchen! It delivers from beginning to end. A super group of sorts they put out this e.p. and then nothing. Hopefully more is on the way. In the meantime, if you find it, buy it!"
1,This vendor doesn't know how to write Shipping Address on package from Order.. Be careful!!!,This vendor does not even know how to write address on a package. I found that my UPS package was not delivered because my Apartment number is missing on the package which I have clearly mentioned while placing the order. I had to take trouble of calling UPS and wait for more than 10 mins to fix this. Try another vendor.
4,Salacious... and fun!,"You'll probably wonder how come this is one of the least known Tito Puente albums, and in fact, one where Tito is not the featured player... Well, this one is one out of three albums with ""songs my mama never taught me"", as the title says. In other words, this is a ""blue record"", so to speak. Most of the songs on this album are full of double-entendres in Spanish, not for the faint of heart. However, don't dismiss it for that reason: it really swings. The definitive track of this album is ""Los Hermanos Pinzones"", a twist on Christopher Columbus' trip to the new world... and the orchestra is really solid on that one, never mind the risqué references. Miguelito Valdés and Joe Cuba are also featured on this one. Not a must-have, but a great party record, nonetheless..."
4,Works as advertised,"Small, powerful, inexpensive...I've used it for pruning trees, cutting garage door rails, normal 2x4's, etc. No problems at all. Ergonomic feel, quick blade replacements, compact. So far I haven't had any problems cutting through anything, and the price was excellent. I have no idea why anyone would pay more for another reciprocating saw...this one will do the job. If anything, the stroke length could be a little longer, but it's fast and powerful enough that it really doesn't detract from it's performance. Overall a definite recommend."
3,"Satisfied, no more, no less","The earrings purchased were of decent quality. The description has them listed SI2-I1 which is a pure stretch, they're definitely on the low end of I1, I've done my research and have looked at enough diamonds of similar quality to know. The earrings themselves are very attractive and are quite nice although the cut is less than desirable but I guess you get what you pay for. For this price you really cannot go wrong for 1/2 carat diamond studs, although I would hope they would revise their description to more accurately portray their product. I'm satisfied with my purchase, that's about it, they're satisfactory, no more, no less."
5,Poignant and Beautiful,"This poignant and beautifully written tale is both inspiring and hysterically funny! An easy read, but brilliantly written, it ties the reader to the book. Without pity, Kathy portrays herself and shows her life through wit and humor that can bring a tear to your eye without making you feel sorry for her. Instead it helps you see your life in better perspective and inspires the reader to attain higher goals. Excellent read."
2,shower curtain only - not a liner,"I bought this to use as a shower curtain liner around my clawfoot tub. There was nothing special about it that made it worth $70. It also did not work as a shower curtain liner. The hook holes are only 4 1/2"" apart versus most store bought decorative shower curtains that are about 6 1/2"" apart. In the end, I purchased 2 polyester liners from Bed, Bath and Beyond for $12 each that worked for my set up and were better quality."
5,This is a review for the song,"""What Comes Around"" is a GREAT song by ill nino. The chorus is rapcore-ish, and the chorus is great nu-metal. If you own ""Revolution/Revolucion"" is guesse it's pointless to buuy the single."
3,It's OK,"I love Ill Nino. They've been one of my favorite bands since last years Ozzfest.But this single is just not worth it. The edit of ""What comes around"" isn't really any different than the original. ""Fallen"" is an OK song, but you can find it on the Revolution/ Revolucion digipak. The live version of ""God save us"" is pretty good but not enough to make this worth buying. Get their album or the digipak of their album.Forget this."
4,Confederate government in Montgomery,"William C.""The writing Machine"" Davis has a very readable style that is so fluid you read without realizing it! He is a very interesting writer in that he brings color to history. Davis performs wonderfully on describing the factions existing within the legislative congress that created the confederacy. He draws from the letters of a great deal of the political giants of the provisional Confederate government and also uses a chronological approach to portray events of the creation of the Confederate government in Montgomery, Alabama. He concentrates mostly on the legislative events in the first few months of 1861; although, he descriptively and almost in detail paints a verbal portrait of the view of Montgomery. This book is definitely a good buy for someone wishing to learn about the Southern Confederate Constitutional convention!"
2,Yeesh.,"This is so utterly moronic... Only people who were already drinking the Dora kool-aid (or had seen this story on TV) could think that this string of words could actually pass for a ""story."" God, ""Dora"" is a dumb show. At least with the books you don't have to hear the obnoxious, whiny voiceovers. I feel sorry for kids who get parked in front of the 'tube when ""Dora"" is on... What a terrible way to spend your childhood."
3,Nice Music,"Not as many of my favorite songs on this CD, but I still like it. It arrived in good shape and I'm glad to add it to my collection."
5,My farvorite group of all time.,"This is a good mix of what Baillie and the Boys have to offer, though I wish they had put the original ""Heartless Night"" on instead of this softer remake. If youv'e never heard their first recording of it on their self-titled debut get it. Every song on it is incredible. Lovin' Every Minute of it has something for everyone with an awesome remake of Judy Collins ""Both Sides Now."" The title song, ""Iv'e been There,"" ""While the Forgettin's Good,"" ""Some kind of Luck,"" ""I can't Help Myself,"" and ""I know a Goodbye,"" are all awesome as well. They are my favorite group of all time."
5,"Excellent Quality, Last a Long Time","I am very pleased with these Truform Support Stockings. My doctor prescribed this type of support hose after vein surgery. The brand he recommended were very expensive, so I decided to compare these to the other brand when I needed to purchase more. These are just as comfortable, give me just as much support, and after wearing them for several months, the Truform look and feel just like new. I'll be purchasing more of these if the the ones I have ever wear out!"
2,Way too Small,Purchased these for my 85 year old Mother who has edema and needs support hose. These are so small I don't see how a child could use them.When I got the package it has a sizing guide on it and we would have needed a 3X but nothing on the listing showed this size chart.
3,Not good for short legs,"The quality of the product is good but I am a short person with short legs and they do not fit well. It would be nice if they made support hoses in different lengths like short, med, or tall. In order to wear these I had to cut inches off. I thought that buying a thicker weave (than the ones I usually buy) they might fit better, but they don't. I will stick with less expensive ones. I have to cut them too, but at least I can buy more of them."
4,leg fatique,"Husband reported less fatique and cramping with the use of the truform. He continues to use. Care is easy, hand wash and reuse."
2,Forced myself to finish,"I look for Barbara Metzger's titles in every used bookshop I enter. She writes warm, funny, sincere stories that I remember long after I've finshed them, which is not true of most romance novels. 'The Duel' was a disappointment. It starts cute, but loses momentum. I found myself skimming, even skipping, to get to the not-surprising end. Pass this one by and read 'Loyal Companion' or 'Rake's Ransom' to get an idea of what this author can do."
4,A good follow-up to A Perfect Gentleman,"As with the previous book, the ""danger"" was too easily resolved. Aside from a few slow scenes and a bit of repetetiveness, that's all the bad that can be said about this novel.Ian is otherwise a compelling hero (his guilt is only a problem in its being drawn out), and Attie, who understandably mothers her little brother and nearly hero-worships Ian at first, is fresh and winsome. The secondary characters are well differentiated and fully developed. Although there's a lot of exposition, it rarely drags and usually adds much to the understanding of the characters and action. The topical quotes at the beginning of each chapter are interesting and humorous.All in all, a good book that leaves me wondering when her next will be out."
4,Delightful Regency Romance,"Barbara Metzger is one of my favorite authors. She is excellent at writing humorous situations and characters. The charactes are all so likeable, especially the badly behaved dog who was deaf!"
5,Fun and great for indoor play,"My 22 month granddaughter was hesitant at the playground on the equipment, so I got this slide for her to give her more confidence, playing on it in her own home. It has been a great success. Her mother likes it because she can fold it up and put it away if she wants a more quiet playtime. Our granddaughter loves it and will use it over and over. We've put a pillow at the bottom to cushion it as there is a bit of a drop. I've since bought a 2nd slide to keep at Grandmom's house!"
1,Doesn't include the front window deflectors,I sent the deflectors back. Looking at the ad was misleading. The picture shows front and rear windows. When I got the item there was only the deflectors for the rear windows. No where in the ad does it say its a 2 piece or 4 piece set.
2,How did this get sold?,This is a bootleg or at least bootleg quality. Only for die hard Nektar fans.
4,Pasta book,Found a lot of interesting recipies and the directions were extrmemely easy to follow. I'm sure I'll have fun trying out a lot of new ways to make pasta.
4,Good reference guide,"Good ""go to"" source for pasta ideas, but is helpful you are already familiar with pasta making process (i.e. I would not make my ""first pasta"" ever).The author gives many flavor options for different pastas (fruit, vegetable, different grains, etc.), which serve as a great source of inspiration if one is feelign creative."
1,Pretty useless,"Take a basic pasta recipe , then add a spice = a new recipe....do that over and over and you have most of this book. Maybe a little too harsh but I was very disappointed."
2,It has potential if you can hunt down the ingredients.,"This book looks like it has been sitting in someone's grandmothers cookbook collection since the 70's. I let that go, after all, I'm in it for the recipes not the cover. There are 20 pages of info before you even get to the recipes... skip them. Once you get to the recipes you learn you need about 5 types of specialty flour that as luck would have it, no store in my town has heard of. Save yourself the $$ and just go to Betty Crocker or pinterest for a simple recipe that you can expand on."
3,"Interesting, but...","I bought this book when I first got my hand-crank pasta machine. It's kind of fun, but most of the recipes are far too elaborate and highly flavoured. Very few of them sound like something you'd want to do start to finish. I agree with the Italians -- pasta is fairly basic -- have fun with the sauces. (I do wish I had the patience to make those cute little candystriped ""packets"", though.)This is inexpensive enough to be an ""idea"" book, if you want to try something ""exotic"", which pasta isn't, of course."
4,The only pasta machine cookbook I need,"I like making pasta to match my whim, and this cookbook has served me well. I have never been disappointed, although I do heed the warnings for certain ingredients (e.g., fresh spinach). The sauces I have tried have also been quite satisfactory (in the same way the French say ""Ca va"" and mean it's very good).This is the only pasta machine cookbook I own - I haven't desired another (and I am a cookbook addict)."
4,Pasta made from many different ingredients,"I wasnt sure what this book was about when I purchased it, but so you know, it is all about making pasta from various different types of ingredients, such as buckwheat, quinoa, rye even, as well as the basic egg dough we are familiar with. It is great to have somethign else to make pasta out of besides the usual flour/semolina. I havent tried too many of the recipes yet, but those I have tried worked out well and the finished product was received well too. Interesting."
5,There's Pasta Everywhere!,"we got into the thing and now, we have pasta all over...It was a real good book..One I'm glad to have added to the shelf..No problem here.."
5,The Pasta Machine Cookbook,"I received this item promptly and in good condition, as far as I know. Because it's a Christmas gift, I cannot tell you any more than that. It hasn't been opened or used as yet."
1,A complete waste of money,"This is a worthless book and not worth buying. It has almost no information about using pasta machines, just page after page of recipes"
3,Tom Paxton Pleases!,"This book isn't about Tom Paxton's personal life but you get a very good idea of what motivated him to write so many wonderful songs. Being the ever so generous man, he has included music and lyrics so others can introduce and play his songs for future generations. Some of my favorite songs are ""All night long, ""Leaving London"", ""The Things I Notice Now"" and of course ""Now that I've Taken My Life"". This is a good buy."
3,Too short for a JLH greatest hits compilation,"If you like John Lee Hooker, you'll dig the music on this disc. The sound quality is good. But there are a lot of great JLH greatest hits compilations out there that give you much more. The total running time of this CD is 27:11 & there are no liner notes. So if you're already into Hooker this won't give you much/anything new, & if this would be your intro to JLH, you'll wind up needing to buy more anyway."
3,Lack of soft copy,"Unlike other certification study guide, this book does not include a soft copy (pdf) in the CD-ROM. It's slower my learning process because I can't read the soft copy when I'm in office (reading a hard copy for weeks is not appropriate in work place).But I have no doubt that the book is very practical and useful. It guides me what chapters cover what exams so that I have a schedule to write the exams."
5,Astoundingly beautiful,"I heard a part of this CD on the radio yesterday morning, and I just have to have it. It is the most gorgeous sound...whoever their countertenor is ...what a voice!"
2,Painfully poor writing at start of book but gets better,"I so appreciate Amazon's reviews. I often buy a book only after reading the reviews. Here's the first sentence from this book- ""Well, what is it this time?"" demanded Miss Grafton, putting her head in its Dunstable straw bonnet trimmed with cerulean blue out of the carriage window, the better to view her surroundings."" What? I knew I was in trouble if the first sentence was such a jumple. The first 20 or more pages of this book are painful to read. The writing is awful. I had to decide whether I was going to go on. I did. This is an enjoyable (enough)read after you've waded through the beginning. This must have been the author's first book and the editors must have been asleep. I'm glad I didn't buy the book but got it through free sources. I wouldn't spend money on it."
4,Torn...,"Torn, as in whether to rate this book as a useful instructional guide, or boring casual reading.Torn, as in the author's feelings on whether to write about the sentiment and philosophy behind photography. Sections get weighed down by the author's need to discuss (in overly maudlin terms) the creative expression offered by photography. I would have preferred a book to be either wholly technical or entirely emotional (and clearly presented as such, so that I could avoid it).Torn, as in the pages falling from this poorly bound book. Several friends have informed me that their copies fell apart, too.All in all, I found the procedural information to be clear and concise, covering not just basics, but some more interesting darkroom techniques. It seemed that the rest was serving as filler; personally I would prefer more picture examples and less of the non-procedural text. However, this book is a good alternative to some of the better, but unfortunately out of print, darkroom guides."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"I wish I could have rated this book star. I bought this book in hopes it would help me learn the fundamentals of this industry. With the credentials of these authors, I expected to get some real insight into how to guide prospects in the right direction, as well as to learn about some general product information. NONE of this is available from this book. It's a complete bust. Don't waste your money!"
5,"Great Book, Changed my thinking about selling promo products","This is a great book. I just wish it wasn't so short.It has changed my thinking about how I sell promotional products. If you do not read this book and we both compete for the same client, I believe I will have an edge on you."
4,Good For Anyone Getting Into This Business,"If you're just starting out selling promotional products, this book will help take off about 3 months of learning the hard way."
4,Don't tell anyone your secret - with a surprise ending !,"I don't think I know anyone who lives this lifestyle. I have a fantasy that these people really do exist. I hope not.The story was so well written that I felt as if I were right there in the room as all this was unfolding and, of course, there was nothing I could do to stop them. This was a story of extremes. The good was so good, the bad was so horrible and permeated so many lives, the surprise really was that.There was a note inside the back of the jacket that John Lucas was writing another novel. I hope it's just taking him a long time to do and that there will be another. I look forward to reading more of his ideas."
2,Not the George of days gone by,"The majority of the ""new"" Curious George books are weak in comparison to the originals. While this one is not the worst of the bunch, it is not anything to celebrate either. In summary: George goes over a friend's house to help the friend's mother bake cakes. When she leaves him alone for a few minutes he throws everything in the mixer and turns it on, creating a terrible mess. He is scolded and helps clean up the mess. Then he eats half a cake that has already been baked without permission. He is forgiven because he finds the mother's necklace, which she had lost, inside the cake. That's pretty much it. The new book lack the imaginative and sometimes educational tone of the originals, and it's a shame because I love George!"
3,It's not what I thought it would be,"When I ordered this bible for my son I was expecting something more similar to a study bible. I thought there would be facts or tips or something to make bible study fun. The description isn't really clear on what the full color tip inserts are, or whatever they call them. They ended up being pictures. I was so disappointed. I can buy a children's bible for a lot cheaper if all I'm looking for is a couple pictures thrown in here and there."
1,"Tells nothing about how to spot a liar, this is a military book.","This book is about military interrogation, not about how to spot a liar. What happened here was an ex-military man wrote a book on how to interrogate prisoners and someone thought they could sell more books by having a catchy title.Total scam, I wish Amazon would take this book off the shelves.A waste fo time reading it. You could get more out of a 5 minute YouTube video that by reading this entire book.How to Spot a Liar doesn't even have a flow to it. During one large section of the book the author Greg Hartley explains differences between people's personalities -- but there's nothing after which tells how to catch a liar with each type.The book's not even put together well, its just a bunch of stuff this guy kept over the years, then slapped it all together to have enough info for a book. I want my money back."
2,How To Spot A Liar,This is very dry reading. I don't know if I will even finish reading it. I wanted it to be able to work with the public and know when I was being lied to.
3,"Had Potential, But Poor Grammar and Organization Ruined It","Interesting concept and helpful information but poorly executed. There were so many grammatical errors in the text, I found it hard to trust what the authors were saying. I think they filled the book with too much fluff just to fill space. They could have said just as much in less words and kept my attention longer. A lot of the information was repeated and I found that it jumped around a lot. Still, it contains useful information to apply in your every day life."
4,Needed information,"Information on picking clues for liars is readily needed and something that is never taught in college. Also, some are given, but when someone writes a book about it, well the info becomes very useful."
4,It really works!,I work with a guy named Dave who I suspected was always telling lies. It drove my nuts and I never knew how to catch him or call him on it. Once I read this book I was able to expose him and keep it from happening any more! Great book!
3,good book but ......,i think it is good book to start and to where to look but he was fast in explaining some ideas and instead he refered you to other books to read if you want to have some more. moreover he did not tell you how to make use of them instead he made to you to discover it.
4,How to Spot a Liar: Why People Don't Tell the Truth... And How You Can Catch Them,"Gregory Hartley and Maryann Karinch have collaborated on an interesting and informative book - which draws on Mr. Hartley's experience as an interrogator. The reader learns the behavioral clues that are discernible when a person is not telling the truth, and finds out how body language exposes the ""liar."" I expected this to be another ""pop"" psychology puff piece, but found that the author's facts and real world experience make it hard hitting and very credible. This book is helpful for virtually anyone - a parent, teacher, friend, employer, employee, sales clerk and anyone else - who has contact with children and adults, who in some situations might benefit by lying."
4,90's indie throwback...in a good way!,"Every time I hear this EP, I'm reminded of Vitreous Humor mixed in with Mineral circa ""The Power of Failing."" Definitely not for everyone, but if you long for that old indie aesthetic formed in the 90's (Crank Records, Polyvinyl, etc.) that has long been ruined and forgotten by contemporary acts, then it should comfort you to know that some newer bands out there still carry that beautiful torch. This album is straight up rock with abandon. It's about writing great and entertaining music and belting out the words like they're meant to be heard, not recycled through the new emo machine that has become so popular the past few years. This band puts the DIY back into music and they do it well."
5,Beltaz!,"Ok im pretty much a techno head... i am very Very picky when it comes to rock cos of all the crap thats floatin around.This band definately have their own sound so... as another guy wrote on this cd's reviews: ""not for everyone..."" but hey... give the soundbites a listen and check out YCNI's ""Ignoto"" i've had that on repeat for 3 days now..."
3,"It rocks, but lacks...","This is a decent album. The only 2 great songs are All Roads to Fault and Iron Chef. The rest are ok, even though there's 6 songs total. I never heard of ycni:m before, but I saw them open up for Funeral for a Friend in London, on 6-12-04, and I was impressed by ycni:m's live show. They are worth checking out."
5,The Best,It is hard to find a Good CD of Johnny Paycheck. This one has his best as well as others. You will not be sorry purchasing this CD>
4,The Best of Johnny Paycheck,"A great collection of Paycheck tunes. CD was delivered in the timeframe promised. Several songs I hadn't heard before but if you like Johnny Paycheck, you'll like them."
2,NON SLOAR LIGHT,"WE ORDERED TWO OF THESE LIGHTS, AND ONLY ONE WOULD CHARGE AND COME ON AT NIGHT. RETURNED THE DEFECTIVE MULTICOLOR LIGHT, AND WAITED FOR A REPLACEMENT. WE RECEIVED THE NEW LIGHT IN A FEW SHORT WEEKS. WHEN WE PLACED IN OUR YARD, WE FOUND IT WAS ALSO DEFECTIVE.(WILL NOT CHARGE)IT DOES COME ON AT NIGHT LIKE THE GOOD ONE, ONLY NEED TO REPLACE THE ENERGIZER BATTERYSEVERY THREE OR FOUR WEEKS. I THINK THIS PRODUCT NEEDS MORE QUALITY CONTROL.AT THIS POINTE WE ARE 33.3 %SATISFIED.LARRY REHFIELD"
1,not as expected,This looks nothing like the picture. It does glow in diff colors but it very difficult to see the colors even though fully charged. Not worth the money at all. The floating color changing ball is much better get that one.
5,"Yummy, Chewy Salmon treats","My mother-in-law gave me a couple of these to share with my Boston Terribles and my older Bichon. They gobble them up. They're chewy and satisfying, and best of all, made with real salmon, so the Omega-6's are included. I highly recommend."
4,Stinky but yummy,"Ok, so our dog loves these, that's great. But they stink so badly that it's hard for us to want to give them to him. So if you don't care about stink then they are great for dogs, if you have a really sensitive stomach you may want to skip these."
3,waking wild spirit tarot,"wonderful and colourful pictures sometimes the explaination is long, but thats' ok if you have time to give to them, the whole design pleases the senses but the meanings differ from the originals I believe."
3,Good,"The pictures are beautiful, but the cards are a bit too big and the actualy meanings of the cards stray too far from the traditional meanings of tarot too much for my own liking. On the whole, I love this deck for collection purposes."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!!,"I bought this book for my vet disease class and I'm very glad I did. Great information, pictures and I like the idea of having quiz questions in there too!! I would recommend this book to any pet owner. You will be very glad you bought it."
5,Good Find,Very impressed how quickly this arrived. And the condition was very good as well. I would definitely buy this book from Amazon again.
4,"Great tripod for an affordable price! After 3 months, it's as strong as it was when I purchased it!","Amazing tripod that is very very very sturdy. You can trust me when I say that. I'm not saying that because this is my only tripod. I've owned over 10 tripods my whole career and this is one of my favorites. I shoot film with this tripod and it holds my equipment with ease. My slider footage is extremely steady. Likewise, it's great for photography as well. This is NOT a cheap tripod. It may be ""cheap"" in price but NOT in performance. This is everything you will need if you are a photographer. The ONLY complaint (not really a complaint) is the weight. It's a heavier tripod. I actually prefer it because it translate to the steadiness. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a traveling tripod."
3,Lousy nature photos don't help baby understand,"If your baby isn't already familiar with the animals pictured, don't expect this book to be helpful in learning about them. The first photo of a mother polar bear trailed by two cubs is perfect (especially if you have twins, as I do). My daughter is also intrigued by the photo of an orangutan and baby. However, they go downhill from there. A text box cuts off the baby whale's tail, and the photo is so dark the eyes can't be seen. In successive photos of baby ducks, deer, elephants, and tiger cubs, the photos are so cluttered that a child can't tell where the baby is and the background or parent's legs are. Even the last photo of the human baby only shows the top of its head. And that's the entire book, end of story! If you want your child to learn about animal parents and babies, take him/her to a zoo instead."
3,So So,"The book says it's for 9 months and up but for such a young age there is too much text. I usually shorten the text to keep my baby interested (and he is a book lover, so that's saying something). Some of the pictures are weird. For instance, you can't even see the whole mama elephant, and you can't see the baby deer's face. With all that said, my baby does still enjoy it. There are many animal books out there, if you ask me, keep looking."
2,"Title should be ""Mommy and Me""","In our household, ""Mommy"" and ""Mama"" are proper nouns and are not interchangeable! So I was excited to see a book about Mamas, only to find that the rest of the book talks about Mommies. An unfortunate choice of title."
5,I made this book required text for my course,"I love this book so much that I made it required text for my Roots and Branches Herbal Home Study Course with the Herbal Medicine Making Kit.NO OTHER BOOK covers ethical wildcrafting like this one. Not only does it have excellent background information, the plant descriptions are fantastic.When I want to know how to wildcraft a plant, this is the first book I reach for. It has helped me in MANY situations.I can't say enough about this book. So I'll stop here... If you want to learn how to harvest plants and use the plants you harvest... this is the book....period."
4,Good book,"For anyonyone that wants to know more about the memdicinal uses of herbs, this is the book to read."
3,"Good, not great","This book is funny and cute, good escapist entertainment. I did like the first book in the series, Summon the Keeper, better. I thought this one seemed a bit stretched in the plot department. But it's still interesting."
5,Best quantitative OR book,"This book covers all the quantitative topics around the loss distribution approach for OR. It follows an actuarial-driven approach to explain the models for frequency, severity and aggregation of loss distribution, and the relative statistical estimating and testing. But do not look for OR management topics in this book: it give its best in the actuarial measurement of operational risk."
2,"Average nutrition-wise, and smelly","This brand of salmon treats have a fairly strong smell. The scent helps keep your dog focused if their attention waivers, however the smell can also be a liability if your dog is so food motivated that it makes him/her crazy.With wheat as the second ingredient (which dogs can't really digest), I wouldn't give these treat to my dogs. Look for something with meat as the first ingredient (not meal or by-product), and without rice, wheat, corn, flour, or sugar added."
3,"Not bad, but not great","Although I liked this book and the characters for the most part, the action and dialogue came off as too theatrical at times in contrast to the serious nature of the plot. The Sheriff's behavior in front of the minister was the worst, totally unbelievable (given his character) and contrived (I later realized) for the sake of a parallel, contrasting scene, which comes later on in the book. I've been reading books by Carolyn Davidson, and so this one didn't quite measure up to my expectations for a similar historical romance novel. I have one more book by this author on my shelf and I plan to give her writing another try before marking her off my list."
2,"the words ""fits my vehicle"" are innacurate","ordered these for my '05 ford escape. they ""fit"" 16-inch wheels but do not work for this vehicle's standard wheels. all kinds of rubbing/squeaking on the rim. they may work on other 16-inch wheels."
5,:),"I spent 6 years in romania studying. I have seen live Johnny and Teo many times alone or with their friends like Harry Tavitian, Ovidiu Lipan or Cornel Stroe.....I am really happy this record made it here....its really great....Johhny is a great jazzman, Teo puts down her soul and the blend of jazz roads and romanian traditional music is really exciting. Far away from the fashion of ethic jazz puts you to think that away from the lounge remixes of standards there are people outhere that still evolve this thing called Jazz. Give them a chance....a hard to find record for a hard not to like duo. THUMBS UP!!!"
3,Decent,"I bought this product after it was recommended by a naturalist for my dogs allergies, he was okay with the taste didn't love it but would eat it especially if mixed with some wet food. I didn't notice much difference between my dogs skin problems before or after this product. I did not buy another package but this is the best price by far for Nupro anywhere!"
2,Dog hated it.... couldn't get a decent refund.,"Bought this because it was in powdered form and easy to add to our dog's food. Problems: extremely strong liver odor; the recommendations on amount to use are way too much; our dog didn't like it; we asked for a return and refund and they said it had to be in original condition - which means unused. But how do you know if your dog likes it until you try it for a little while? Gave up trying to get a refund and gave it to our son and daughter-in-love and their dog loves it! Make sure your dog likes liver flavor, and be prepared to have it totally coat any canned dog food you use. It does make a good gravy if your dog likes the flavor, and likes gravy. Ours doesn't. Oh well, live and learn."
5,Toilet Paper Holder,It holds the toilet paper as described and looks great. Very easy to setup without tools. It does what it should.
5,A very nice feature on our bathroom!,I love the brass color and have gotten many compliments from family members. I got a good price too! Thanks!
5,Gatco Toilet Paper Dispenser Pedestal,This item arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape. It was easy to put together and looks just perfect in our bathroom.I'm a happy customer.
5,PAPER WORK MADE EASY,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.WELL MADE AND VERY ATTRACTIVE DECORATIVE ADDITION TO THE ROOM.COULD NOT BEAT THE PRICE ANYWHERE,AND IN MY AREA WE COULD NOT FIND THE POLISHED BRASS COLOR AT ANY OF OUR LOCAL STORES. LEAVE IT UP TO AMAZON TO COME THROUGH AGAIN!THANK YOU,AND WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN."
4,"Well made, but not the finish I was looking for","This is a well made product especially for the price; however, the sight I purchased it from had it listed as an Oil Rubbed Bronze finish and the finish is actually just bronze. If you are looking for something that is dark with bronze highlights, this may not be what you want. If you are looking for a regular bronze finish then I highly reccommend it."
4,"Nice Height, A Little Too Light","I like the look and feel of this piece overall. The actual roller part is made of plastic which is disappointing, but not a deal breaker. The stand is a good height for use, and the base is small enough that it doesn't get in the way. We have the satin nickel finish, which matches the decor in our bathroom nicely.The only drawback is it's a little bit lightweight (still a reasonable weight, just light for some use), but overall a very nice and attractive addition to our new bathroom."
5,Nice heavy base,This is the third Gatco tissue holder that I've ordered. Now I have one for each bathroom. I've had the first for nearly a year and there are no signs of pitting or rust. It is also well weighted so it doesn't turn over easily. Probably the most amazing thing- I ordered it yesterday and got it today!
2,Looked like Antique Brass - Not oiled rubbed bronze,I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder! These looked like antique brass and not oiled rubbed bronze - sent them back.
4,Very pleased!,Product is well made. The base is heavy enough that it doesn't move when tearing off paper. Very pleased with the product and Amazon.
4,Nice and great price,"This toilet paper holder looks as good as much more expensive ones at places like Restoration Hardware. The bottom is heavy enough to keep it in place, so you get great quality for a lower price."
4,new addition,After having remodeled my bathroom I realized I was in need of a floor standing holder. This fits the bill wonderfuflly. It's well balanced so it doesn't tip nor slide around. It does have a bit larger footprint than I had anticipated but that's well worth it.
2,Design flaw,"Very nice looking item. Screwing in the paper holder to the top of the pole was no problem, nice and tight. Unfortunately, screwing the bottom of the pole into the base was a BIG PROBLEM. The threaded bolt in the base had about an inch of threads, while the bottom of the pole had maybe 1/8"" of threads, not nearly enough to hold the pole securely to the base. 3-4 turns and that's it. Needless to say, it's easily stripped, which I did. Rather than go to the trouble of returning it, I broke out the Gorilla Glue and it seems to have done the trick. But I shouldn't have had to do that. Would've been 5 stars except for that problem."
4,exactly as described,This is a good quality paper holder; I've had it a little over a year now. It never tips over. The plastic roll holder is a little figety to get the roll back on sometimes but not an especially big deal. The bronze color is nicely finished and looks great with my decor. It's always nice when a product meets expectations from the listing; this one really is just as pictured/described.Pleased with this purchase and recommended.
4,Pricy!,"While I am pleased with the quality and function of this item, I found a similar product at Wallyworld for about 1/3rd the price."
4,Top 10 RPG for PS2,"This is definitely a must play for the PS2, whether you are an rpg fan or not. This game has excellent music and the voices to the characters fit perfectly. Everything is, obviously, according to D&D. The replay value is there for you can get Drizzt Do'Urden (possibly spelt that wrong), but that goes back to nothing but hack and slash. By far what makes this game the best is the fact that this is the first game that I have played that the two player co-op is really co-op. Most the time co-op games only allow the the 2nd player to assist the first in the story. In this case it allows both 1st and 2nd player to talk to the characters. This game is fun one player but even better 2."
4,A weekend adventure,"Last year my husband and I rented this game, and we played it over the course of a weekend, pretty much whenever we were awake. It was like taking a mini vacation without having to leave home and pack for inclement weather.We had played the original Baldur's Gate on the PC years ago with another friend of ours over our network and didn't too like the controlling multiple characters. This game version of it much streamlines the character control and the action pace is steady enough that it's not tedious or impossible.I highly recommend playing this game in 2 player mode. That's part of the fun of the experience! I can't wait for the next installment... there's just gotta be a next installment I have unanswered questions from this one."
3,"Great Relief, but just another Diablo","In the car coming home from renting this game I was pumped. I had read all of the online reviews about Dark Alliance I could get my hands on and they all fuled my fire to make the drive over to blockbuster. I [raced through] this game. I sat down and just destroyed the thing in a matter of three days. Looking back, i was not that impressed. Half way through the second act, i wasnt inspired to play the game anymore, i just wanted to get my moneys worth. This game would be great for someone who gets satisfaction out of a shallow, combat based RPG like Diablo. The combat is more point and click, and the towns you visit (only three mind you) consist of one interactive building each. So, if you want something that wears you fingers out but keeps you mildly entertained in the process, rent, dont buy, this game.p.s. there are only three choices in character, and you dont even get to name him/her for God sake."
2,"Good lord, this was a let down.","I am player of a great many systems, PC, PS1 and 2, and many more and this game was one of the worst that I have seen in a great many moons. Don't get me wrong, the graphics and the game play are good (for the 4 hours you'll put into it to beat it) but, I was completely disappointed in the overall game. The characters are set, and the replayablity [needs help]. One you get your character to a certain point, weapons, armor, ect., you can't go anyfurther. It wasn't even close to what I had hoped. I beat the game in a just a few hours. If you're in the mood for a short entertainment value game, then this is your best bet. If not I would suggest ANYTHING else. I expected better things from Black Isle."
2,Rent don't buy. Might take you a day...if you're lucky.,This game has some good graphics but it is all done in a day.How they got away with this is beyond me.I can only think that they are creating games for the rental market. One nights rental and you're done.Heads up everyone.
2,"Fun Co-op, but buggy gameplay.","Great fun with a friend, but we experienced some fatal programming errors (resulting in the need for restart of the entire game)."
5,We play it together,"This game has been a great way for my stepson and me to spend time together. Since we can both play simultaneously, we are sharing and problem solving together. Other two player games we've tried have not been nearly as interesting. The graphics and movies are very good and clear, the story line is interesting, and it's not too difficult for him at age 8. We're looking forward very much to the sequel coming in April 2004."
4,Grab a friend and grow an obsession,I'm the first to admit that there are now lots of wickedly addictive RPG games that make this feel like it is what it is; something out of the last generation of games. What's also worth mentioning though is that this is still a GREAT game; best when shared with a friend or family member. I would wager that this will still be the case 10 years from now. There's just something almost timeless about this game. And there are plenty of reasons to buy a copy of your own. So go ahead and buy with confidence.
2,A good franchise reduced to Diablo-esque dullness.,"Has absolutly nothing to do with the PC Baulder's Gate games. Only three charatures classes from the 3rd Edition rules. Limited characture customization for it supposedly benig a AD&D game. To short. Storyline was decent, but that is about it. Bottomline stick to Diablo for your hack and slash games and go buy the PC Baulder's Gate games for better use of the AD&D license. If you really want to try it, just rent it."
4,Fun game,"Fun game to keep my friends and I occupied, definitely a blast from the past and I'm glad I found it."
2,Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,I was pretty unimpressed with the game. I bought it mainly due to the computer version which I thought was awesome. This is more of a hack and slash mindless game that reminds me of PS2's Champions.
3,Good but not spectacular,"Graphics wise, this game is lackluster. At times you get nice images but everything's so dark and shadowed it's rather hard to tell. You don't have many character choices and you basically just press the attack buttons. Over and over. If you're into this kind of fighting game, try ""Champions of Norrath""."
5,Balder's Gate,"The overall experience of this process was great! Easy to order, the game came faster than I thought it would. The only issue was one that had nothing to do with the ordering process. We have a PS3 and since we can play PS games with no problems, we thought we'd be able to play PS2 games. This is not the case. So we actually aren't able to play the game. Will probably have to sell it."
2,major pain,"I have purchased this game twice and have run into the same glitch in the middle. It starts off really fun, gets you hooked then freezes right in the middle. I know it's an old game but come on. Buyers beware"
4,it's already over,.great game. fun..and incredibly short..it's a rental based upon the length of the game. there isn't enough content here..but what is here is fun. very fun. and that should be incentive enough to cough up the five.spot to rent this bad.boy some weekend.
2,What tha???,"I beat it in 10 hrs and I was taking my precious time. Its a great game but so short it wasn't worth the money. It was about as long as I would expect the demo to be. The ending is lame, it an advertisement for the next game!!!!! A to be continued!!! Its an outrage! Grrrrr.... I was extremly disappointed in how short they cut this game up, in order to sell the next. I will NOT buy the sequel. It'll be a waste of money. To be continued..."
1,way to short,"great graphics.....little else, 8.5 hours of game play that even on the hardests setting, it is easy save your money.P.S.the ending of the game stinks"
3,Solid action RPG,"At first I was a bit disappointed that this was not a real RPG like BG or BG2. Dark Alliance (DA) is more an action RPG like the Diablo games. DA has great graphics and music (far better than Diablo 2) and is pretty addictive. It doesn't make a real impact though. A solid action RPG, but nothing really special."
3,hello,"I haven't played this game all the way through, but it's 4 discs long, so how can it be short?????! i have played a little bit of it, only to where i defeated the rats and went into the basement again. From what i played, it's a very good graphical game and the controls are pretty good. So i have to do my homework, bye!!"
5,"Dungeons, Dragons and You.......","Although quite a bit like Diablo, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is one fantasy adventure you shouldn't miss. Set in the D&D; universe, you play as one of three characters ridding the land of evil and leveling up your character as you progress through the game. With spells and such, this game is a sight to behold. The graphics are perfect, everything has a realistic look to it. My one and only gripe is the control...I feel it could've been somewhat better but it is a small gripe to say the least as it doesn't hinder the game.So, if you're a Dungeons and Dragon's fan or you just like action RPGs, do yourself a favor and check out Baldur's Gate:Dark Alliance."
4,This game was short but hella fun,"Having never played the computer version i was a bit reluctant to try this game, but I'm glad i took the risk. This game was really fun. The only problem was the lack character classes and customization and the short lenght of the game. It only took 10 hours for a friend and i to beat this on 2 player. I will definatly buy the second game in this series when it comes out. I think it would be grat if you could import your characters from the old game in to the new one to continue the adventure. I just hope the second one is a bit longer and will let you customize your characters."
4,Great Game - for a couple of days...,"Excellent graphics, great controls, and D&D 3rd edition rules combine for an outstanding RPG game. Unfortunately, it's shortcomings are important: Limited character types (only three of the myriad 3rd edition options are available), and length of gameplay (12-15 hours per character). I'm not disappointed that I bought it, but most people would probably prefer to rent it (on a five day rental you should be able to play through the game at least once) rather than buy it. Absolutely a five-star game if it required 30-40 hours to play through it."
4,Hack and Slash RPG,"I was really disappointed with Final Fantasy X and a friend pointed me towards BG:DA. While it is very action oriented and a little short, it is wall to wall action with only a little box shoving and platform hopping (I hate games that add elements of Mist).I would have been happier with more of a traditional RPG, but Dark Alliance has kept me very entertained.There are quite a few secrets and extras to be had including using Drizzt Do'Urdin as a player character.I hope they make more D&D; games for the PS2, but I think I'd like to see a party oriented RPG instead of the hack and slash."
3,a bit of a let down,"i was really excited to start playing this as i'm a d&d holdout and the fact that it received great customer reviews but over all found the game lacking. on the first hand you can't even make a custom character (the cornerstone of d&d), and on the second hand the game is really, really basic. i'm not saying that i didn't have fun but i did find it very anticlimactic overall. there's some good d&d touchs added but i was hoping for more from an officially licensed game."
3,Decent.,"Well, I was hoping to get an old-fashioned RPG game in my console. Instead , I get Diablo-like gameplay. Read my review on Diablo if you want, that's why I gave it 3 stars. Thee is a good story in this game, but in the first town, you only get to go in one place! That's it! Don't you remember the huge sidequests you can get in Baldur's Gate? This game is just follow the story and make it quick. However, the grpahics and gameplay are great. The monsters were impossibly difficult, but on multiplayer, they sure drop like flies. Enjoy."
5,"A good, mentally relaxing time.","Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is an idiosyncratic title. If you must have waves of strategy and a sussurus of storyline constantly pounding your mind, this game is not for you. However, if you can accept its lack of the aforementioned, you will have some unadultured fun.BG: DA is not a thinking man's game, it's a hack-and-slash. Sending the player through droves of seemingly-endless monsters in Diablo-style is the point of the game. A short, though adaquately written, storyline weaves around the gameplay; the gameplay is the obvious main focus. Strategy amounts to not entering a large group of enemies that guarantees your death, putting the correct weapons on, allocating gained skill points effectively, and healing when necessary. Not exactly mind-bending, but acceptable and fun.If you need heavy, deep times--stay far away. However, if you desire a break from those times or prefer lesser mentally-challenging titles, this game is definitely for you."
2,Decent but below potential,"I expected much more. I played this just after Summoner2. The graphics in Baldur's gate were much less attractive, and the product felt a little canned due to the lack of choices in the game. The zoom-in map feature was good, but it was annoying that it couldn't be panned. The storyline was fine. Overall a mediocre experience."
2,this was a waste of time..,"I finished this game in seven hours...I was expecting AT LEAST 20-30 hours of good solid gameplay. It looks like this was very rushed, and hardly any thought was put into it at all. To anybody looking to play this game, RENT IT. I started it on a saturday morning at 8am, and finished it by 2pm or so. It's really a short game...very disappointed."
4,Best Two Player I've Found,"I'm not into the D&D stuff much, but I found this game to be a lot of fun. It is the best two-player game I've found, because it's a true co-op mode, and it doesn't split the screen.Another great feature is the ability to import a saved character. This can make for some fun, going back to the early levels and tearing the place apart. And, I'm hoping it will come in handy when the next game comes out.Only drawback is the length -- finished it over a weekend. But it has some fun replay value."
4,visuals....visuals....visuals,"This game has extremely great graphics and lots of very well done voice acting but the gameplay itself has a certain lack of variety.GRAPHICS:10/10: These graphics are better than anything i've ever seen in PS2 game. Facial expressions down to every wrinkle, Extremely smooth textures and everything else imaginable.SOUND:10/10: Very good voice acting, probaly the best I have heard. It adds to the mysteriouness of the game.CONTROL:10/10. Simplistic great controls. I especially like how they did the potions.CINEMAS:7/10: Nothing special just some here and there to explain stuff.REPLAY:6/10: Well I suppose you could play it again..STORY:9/10. It makes you want to finish the game.OVERALL FUN: 7.5/10: This is a good game but it doesn't really have any combos or anything. The leveling up system is a lot simplier than the other baldur's gate games.(It's better) But the game is short. Definitely rent this game, It's up to you if you want to buy it."
3,"Good RPG, but too short!","I really wanted to give this game higher than a 3 (in fact, call it 3 1/2). It had excellent graphics, an absorbing storyline, an excellent combat system (the best I've seen to date, in fact)and well-developed characters. As a former D&Der, I'd say many parts of the game remain true to the original concept. So why did I only give it a ""3""? TOO short!! It left me disappointed at the end and wanting more. I know, you can always unlock the extreme level and redo the entire game, but it's mostly the same stuff all over again (just harder monsters). I think it's worth playing, just not worth the money to buy. I wish I had rented it instead of buying. I could have played the entire game in 3 days. I'd like to see another in the series, but my advice to the game designers is to make it a bit longer next time. Maybe then, I'll buy it...."
2,Boring game,I rented this game and lost interest in it before my rental was up. I actually got the final level and realized i had no reason to continue playing. The story becomes uninteresting very quickly. Graphics are good. Control is good. Dialogue is unbearably boring. Levels are redundant.
2,Rip Off,"Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance is a well made game as the other reviews here say - top graphics, playability, etc.But it is far too short for $US40. I knocked it off over two days whislt also playing RTCW. This game should be $US20.I recommend that buyers wait until it goes on sale.dugite"
2,Not the original,I was pretty disappointed by Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance. I love the PC Baldur's Gate series for everything that is missing from the PS2 version. The characters are hardly customizable. The story line is fixed and rigid. There is little sense of adventure nor of ownership of character as in the PC versions of Baldur's Gate. The hack and slash style of this game requires no thought or stategic planning as did the older versions. I am pretty disappointed because I was looking forward to this game for so long.
5,It is DAA BOOMMMBB,"This game is cool, I beat the whole game, the gauntlet, extreme mode, i even got the onyx sword with does 90-140 damage which is daaaa bomb and Drizzt is a unknown char u can get from cheat codes, he can fight with 2 swords in his hands which he is da bomb also."
2,Baldur's Gate?? Are you sure?,"Well after hearing some great reviews about Baldur's gate from a friend i decided to rent the ps2 version.Well, what can i say? I beat the entire game in 2 days. Yes. in easy mode, but still..geez.Anywayz, i talked to my friend and i guess this game is missing all the spiffy role-playing elements that make Baldur's Gate so great.So i ask you, why the hell make a ps2 version of a game but then fail to make it actually like the Baldur's Gate games?A waste of money if you bought this game."
4,Good buy not Final Fantasy good,this game looks great but if you lookin for a great RPG Final Fantasy X is the game to get trust me!
1,Since when could magic missiles miss?,"I enjoyed Baldur's Gate I and II for the PC, for hack and slash ""rpgs"" they were immersive, and while not as fun as sitting around the table with my friends and my dice, they were a good waste of time. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is different. I picked it up because it was cheap, and I'm kind of a nerd and collect Forgotten Realms stuff, and it did say it followed 3rd edition rules. Right. What I got was one of the worst games money could buy that basically, in my opinion, made fun of d&d. And the magic missiles... I missed a lot with them in this game...in d&d they can't miss. Period. This game was awful... I miss games that had a plot"
1,is this for you!,If you play PS2 games you will love this! This type of game is very simalar to the final fantsey RPG games. personaly this is the best PS2 game I ever played.there is a total of 3 levels all extermialy challenging.
5,Worth Re-reading,"This story has several levels. The surface plot surrounds a father wrongly accused of molesting his daughter, convicted on the word of lies told by the mother and the child that is so convincing that the child's aunt, a therapist, initiates the actions that send him to prison.Four years later, after her father is paroled, the child admits that she lied, setting into motion the steps needed to clear him. The secondary story is how this embittered surgeon who has lost everything is handling being humiliated by his parole officer, being stalked by an enemy, all while working as a bartender in a biker bar. Throughout the story is the pain and re-discovery, and ultimate triumph of the re-kindled love growing between him and his daughter's aunt. I've read this book three times, and loved it each time. I still think it's one of PDRs best."
4,"A Fun, But Chilly Ride","This is just a great disaster story. If you like man vs. nature stories, or if you enjoyed the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"" then you should pick this book up. An erupting volcano has drastically changed the weather patterns in the northern hemisphere and it's up to a geologist millionaire and a British biologist to save England. These guys get everything thrown at them, an erupting volcano, a runaway iceberg, a starving wolfpack, political backstabbers, and finally face an impending war. Sure, the science may be a little far-fetched, the charaterization may seem a little trite, and the goal at which our heroes are aiming for, the bioshpere mini-earth, seems a little weak, but the action and suspense kept me turning the pages. If you enjoy a good action tale, don't pass this one up."
3,Good but flawed,"This book seems to have it all. The characters are rich and detailed, and the requisite thriller-style macho hero seems missing in action (a relief if you ask me). The two main characters -- Drs. Benjamin Meade and Marjorie Glynn -- are human and interesting. To explain what I mean in the second sentence, let me mention that Dr. Meade is a recovering alcoholic. The plot is intriguing -- a mid-Atlantic volcano erupts, plunging the Northern Hemisphere into a new ice age, while leaving the Southern half of the globe alone. There's only one problem: at page 200, Mr. Moran must have suddenly noticed the looming deadline and said, ""Oh my gosh, I've got to finish this ---!"" Benjamin Mead pulls a rabbit out of his geyser (er, hat) and stops the invading Irish army. Whoops. Moral of the story: If you like this book, you'll love Earth Winter. If you haven't read it, you probably shouldn't bother."
3,A lightly entertaining disaster genre book,"Empire of Ice is interesting in light of the recent wave of disaster films and mini-series coming out of Hollywood. The premise is intriguing and there are some interesting science factoids in the novel (although I can't vouch for their accuracy), but ulitmately, the book suffers from some weak characters. The two leads inevitably fall in love (why do books of this type *have* to have a romantic subplot?) and they both inevitably pit themselves against ""bad guys"" (and why do the antagonists who stand in the heroes' way always get killed by the disaster in question). But the characterizations take a back seat to the disaster (a common thing in these books/movies) and so I never really found myself caring very much about them. This is an interesting, mildly entertaining and quick read, but it's definitely eye candy -- not much of substance to stay with you past the last chapter"
3,not too bad,"what we have here is an interesting scenario, what if a volcanoe erupted and caused volcanic winter throughout the northern hemisphere. and to top it off there is some severe tensions between england and ireland. pretty good book."
1,here comes another one........,"Well, once again the music world will be assaulted with another Lois Jordan clone. Man oh Man, is this getting boring. The Atomic Fireballs are good in their own way, however, (yawn), do we really need another zoot suit costume band on the scene."
3,too short,"The biggest problem with this cd is that it's too short. It's all fun swing music, but after a while it got annoying, which doesn't happen with other swing bands like Big Bad Voodoo Daddys. The reason I bought this cd was because I loved the song ""Man with the Hex"" after I heard it off of the scooby Doo soundtrack. I still think that's the best song on this cd, and the rest of the songs are okay, but nothing great."
1,Boring Textbook With no Substance,"This book is laid out like a university textbook but contains nothing of substance to even attract a backward university film studies course to add it to the curriculum. No in depth analyses of the stars or movies are in here although there are a few paragraphs on a select few. How is George Clooney an action star? It seems the author is gong for increased sales by including a popular star and favourite of many women but to say he is an action star, please. Why this book is laid out like a textbook is anyone's guess. I guess the publishers took one look at the substance and said there are better similar books out there in the entertainment category, such as 1000 Movies to Watch Before You Die, so we'll try something different and try for education but they failed. Give this a miss."
4,Nice,Lots of stories Some information. Looks like a good read. asjdfk ;alksdajf laksdjf lkasdjf jiiwejf klasdjf l needed more words
3,Be careful of washing these!,"These are so cute. I love the pattern and whimsical idea. When I received them, I loved the feel and color. But I can't see washing socks on anything less than warm water. And when I did, they shrunk to about 1/2 size - no kidding. My daughter was so disappointed. I had her stretch them back enough to get it on her foot, but it's not something comfortable to wear after this first washing. Very disappointing. I give it 3 stars because it is so cute and I suppose you could wash them on cold."
4,Holds it all,"Holds all of my Nuvi 350 accessories and then some. All the removable pockets are great when organizing the case. It's a bit bulky to just grab and go, so my only wish would be for a carrying handle."
3,does not fit all GPS models......,"I bought this case based on the pictures, but it turns out that you can't really tell what will fit. It would have been nice to know what size the internal cases where, as I could have had an idea if my nuvi would have fit. I can tell you it will not accommodate a Garmin 1450 into any of the internal cases. But it is a great case for the price and does fit all the peripherals that come with this Garmin. I only need to purchase a soft case for the nuvi 1450 and all will fit nicely in this case. The hard outside shell will offer great protection when in the field or on the trail. So....if you want a case that will hold all you stuff....this is it....just don't expect any of the internal cases to hold something big than the 4 inch size GPS and it might be tight even with those (since I can't actual check)."
4,Satellite radio case (and Car-GPS case too!),"This case isn't quite what I thought when I ordered it, but it is just as good as I expected. The case is hard. The inside ""sections"" are really just small cases with velcro that sticks to the inside of the hard case. This was annoying at first, but it does allow you to arrange the stuff any way that you want. After a while, I decided I liked it better that way.Inexpensive, too."
3,Mathematical error and misleading conclusion on page 99.,"For the most part an excellent, easy to follow work. However, on page 99 (item #3, bottom of page) the author states the incorrect equality: 2(phi+1+1/phi)=4, for the surface area of the golden cuboid. Correctly, the surface area of the given cuboid should be equal to approximately 6.472. This error could be overlooked except for the fact that the author extrapolates on this incorrect result (next page, item #4) and hints at a connection between pi and phi. The author uses his incorrect constant of proportionality, namely ""4"", which appears in the figuring of the surface area of the circumscribing sphere and the cuboid, as evidence of this ""connection"". Thus, in the guise of some illusive geometric ""hint"", leaving the reader with the idea that a tie between these two constants may exist in this geometric figure. The significance of this error cannot be overlooked."
3,I agree with the gentleman from Atlanta...,"The review from Atlanta said he was tempted to staple entire pages together to eliminate the gushing in this book... I actually went through with a marker and crossed out what irritated me (about a third of the book).Aside from that, this book does an excellent job at giving a beginner a handle on phi. Many of his examples either don't work out (as the other commentators have indicated) or more often, aren't spelled out well enough for the novice. Nonetheless, it's a book worth having. The relationships between E, Pi, and Phi, the three constants for the three dimensions of numbers, are well treated.Mark Vedder"
3,Not for the designer...,"I bought this book together with ""Geometry of Design"" thinking they where similar... but this is just a mathematical book ... sorry for those who like maths... but I was expecting something more for the designer.Maybe for those who are not designers, but number-reladioned this is a great book... but that's not my case."
5,Yummy Chummies,"I purchased Yummy Chummies about 7 years ago while on a trip to Alaska. We brought a bag home as a special treat for our Sheltie. He loves this treat so much that we have continued to buy the product online. It is a bit pricey to purchase at pet stores due to the small package size, so we buy the larger 2 1/2 pound value bag. Our Sheltie is now 12 years old and still looks forward to his special treat."
2,"Great product, but this bag I got was dry, not chewy as in the past.",I have purchased this product before. The treats are supposed to be soft & chewy. This order arrived dry and hard. Not sure why. Bag appears to be sealed.
1,Moldy Treats...then questionable return.,"The package had a good expiration date of June 2015, but when I opened the package the treats were moldy (I took photos). Now, I know this is probably not a typical issue and my dogs love these treats....(I think I'm done buying these, unless at Costco). No issues about the return. However, I just got an email stating the product is not available to ship, but when I goto the link they sent me, there are 17 in stock. So, I am questioning the reliability of the company. Moldy treats, then they are either ""misleading"" me in my email or ""misleading"" the customers. I will be watching to make sure they refund my money."
1,moldy oldie,I have purchased Yummy Chummies from Costco in the past and my pups love them. The bag that I rec'd from Amazon was moldy. Most of it covered with white and green fuzz. I didn't want the hassle of sending them back so I put them in the oven and baked them to kill the mold. That stunk my house up and made the treats hard as a rock. Two thumbs down and a waste of money.
3,Yummy Chummies should be refrigerated now.,"I've been a big fan of Yummy Chummies, and have bought these for years -- Costco used to carry them. I never had a problem with them going bad until the bag I received in mid-December (this is mid-February). I opened the bag last week to find that they were completely moldy.My pups love them, and I've given bags of them as gifts to other dog friends -- have always recommended them. But now my recommendation will come with a caveat: KEEP THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR!They must have changed the formula, because they are much softer and crumblier than in the past. I don't know whether I'll buy them again now. Too bad!I also bought some of the salmon oil at the same time, and have put it in the 'fridge in hope that it won't go bad."
4,Arctic Paws 2-1/2-Pound Yummy Chummies Original Bulk treats,My dog really loves the Arctic Paws Yummy Chummies. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because the treats have a tendency to break down in the bag and become a powder. I use the powder in his food when the treats are gone but wish they would hold together better.
5,Treat Review,My dogs LOVE these treats! I use them for training treats cause you can break them up easy and they are soft. I did have a problem one time with a bag but the company was great with handling the problem. They were quick to respond and very polite. I will continue to buy these and other products from this company! And they are made in America.
2,Crumbles,"My dog loves his Yummy Chummies and I have ordered them from Amazon a number of times. This time they arrived in almost total crumbles. We will use the crumbles on his food(he's that much of a fan), but will hesitate to purchase again."
4,Dogs LOVE them!,"I first got a hold of this product on a visit to AK and brought it home to my sled dogs as a souvenir. They loved it so much that I HAD to order more, but of course a flight to AK was not in the near future. I was happy to find that Amazon had them and offered free shipping if I spent enough! I ordered two of the 2 1/2 pound bags and was disappointed to find one of the bags had not been sealed properly and product was all over the shipping box. Though not a huge problem, it makes me wonder whether the poor seal was a company mishap or result of bad handling. The product is still edible, or so it seems, as my dogs still love them. I just wonder if the second SEALED bag will be more welcomed! For like-ability...I give it a 5 star. For packaging...4 star. Overall, I will buy this product again."
3,product change,"I was surprised when I received this formerly ""perfect"" treat. I had gotten all my dog club friends a large bag for Christmas. In this more recent shipment the product was different in that the pieces were twice as large as in the past. This means it goes 1/2 as far. What an unpleasant surprise. My dogs still love it as much, but in this time of economizing I am not pleased with the change."
3,Yummy Crumbies,"First saw this size at Costco, but they don't carry it anymore. Compared to the tiny bag at the pet store this is a good deal except when the bags arrived they were about 1/3 crumbs. Not sure if the shipping did that to the product or ....? Great treats and dog loves em."
5,Yummmmmy!,My dog uses them for search n rescue the treats and she LOVES them! They are a bit stinker than the last batch and the bag was not as sturdy as the last one but they are still yummy!
4,A pain to put together,"Sort of like a jigsaw puzzle which was exactly what we were not looking forward to on Christmas. Also, is kinda silly unless all 6 holders are full."
5,Unique!,Love this wine holder. Keeps wine out of the way and is a fun conversation piece. Very pretty too. Made of copper!Look for this on Amazon!
2,"Great concept, not reality yet","With great expectations, I set up my Maxtor 500 GB shared storage drive -- hoping it would mean that my wife and I could both save key documents, photos and videos to it from our separate computers on our home network ... and, consequently, share these files, photos and videos -- from anywhere in our house. And my guess is that once wireless home networks are faster (they'll have to be much faster), this dream will become a reality. But right now, it can't happen -- unless you're talking about smaller files. The transfer speeds over a home wireless network are too slow to make this a practical solution -- certainly for large files. What's more, the Maxtor is noisy. Very noisy. The noise wouldn't be a problem if you were just turning on the drive periodicaly (to save or grab something), but if it's to fill the role of readily available shared storage, it has to be on quite a bit."
4,Using for music streaming,"PROS:This maxtor Shared storage Plus is compatable with the ROKU Soundbridge music streaming device. I bought both together, and filled up the maxtor with mp3s. When I turn on the ROKU, it finds the Maxtor drive on the network and streams up the music via the ROKUs wifi link. The ROKU plugs into any stereo, and has its own display of song info and remote control.This is great beacuse now my computer does not need to be on to listen to music. Now I dont need to use Microsoft windows mediastreaming service, which ties up a lot of RAM on a computer otherwise.You can plug in old USB drives into the maxtor, which makes them available on the network, (But not available to stream music from).CONSThe maxtor takes longer to transfer files to than a normal USB2.0 drive since it is going through your network.The green light on the front of the unit is always blinking sporadically even when your not accessing the drive."
3,OK,"I bought the Maxtor not only because of the external storage but also because it has the ability to hook a printer and access it remotely. I thought that would save me from getting another device to hook up my printer to my wireless network. Not until after I did it, did I find out that it does not support printers that are a combination printer, fax, copier. Access it good when it is I am hooked up via an ethernet cable but extremely slow when I am accessing it wirelessly."
1,Mine seized up after one month,"I have no idea why but it just stopped working. Maxtor wants me to send it back to them and then after 10 business days they will send me a new one, so between shipping and waiting time i will be out of a drive for three weeks minimum. I have tons of data on this thing so im not comfortable sending it to anyone. I'm gonna buy a buffalo linkstation instead"
3,Worked GREAT until recently,"I've had the MSSP for over a year now. It's worked great for backing up and storing videos and other media. It's a perfect solution, really. I was quite angry after it failed on me about a week ago. The web-front is reporting NO folders/directories present. If you do not know what I mean by this, they show up like shared folders on any windows machine in ""My Network"". I have mine mapped to a drive letter, to allow easy access. However, for the past week, it hasn't let me in. For the time I've had it, it's been a great drive. However, since all hard drives fail and I'd recommend it on that alone."
5,True Fans Need This CD,"Any mega-hardcore fan will tell you, this is a must have for your collection.If you are knew to the Ladies, you might want to start out with their ""Stunt"" or ""Maroon"" CD's.You will then no doubt become hooked and end up purchasing their entire collection!This band is the most under-rated and under-exposed band out there!"
1,STINKS WORSE THAN FUNKY FEET! I HATE IT!,"I truly detest this song. It is sheer madness. This asinine song makes no sense and is darned annoying and grating. I wish I had never heard it and feel it has nothing to recommend it. As for the guy who laughs at funerals, I wonder if he would have laughed had this lousy tune wound up in the One-Hit Wonders lost file as a chart statistic.I HATE THE BARENAKED LADIES!"
2,Region Code error.,"This was intended for my 2-year old daughter. Upon arrival, we discovered and received Region Code errors on the DVD's.It looks as though it shipped from Belgium and perhaps wasn't configured correctly for U.S. destination. I am returning and currently awaiting the response toward a valid configured replacement."
1,disappointment,"I'm a longtime Phish fan and a veteran of many concerts and my opinion is this Round Room album is horrible. It's such a letdown after such a long wait. Pebbles and Marbles is okay but everything else is unacceptable, unless you're one of the non-objective fans for whom Phish can do no wrong, or in serious denial. When you see positive reviews that post excuses (""you have to remember that Phish just came out of a two-year hiatus"" or ""you have to listen to it a few times"") you know it's a bad album. I tried playing it at work and the consensus was it's a horrible album. I wouldn't try this album if you're wanting to check Phish out. However if you can spin a cacophonious mess into positive asset (i.e. showing the versatility of the band, beautiful lyrical imagery, etc.) then go for it. Phish is not for everybody, this album isn't for anybody."
1,no such thing as quality control for this band,"long time fan. with so much product available (the LIVE phish series), i would avoid this like the plague. listened so many times, hoping it would grow on me like ""story of the ghost"", for example; but it never did.apparently, the band had no plans to issue an album before their reunion tour. this was put together impromptu during rehearsal sessions. and it sounds like it. they should have stuck to the plan.what you get here sounds loose and uninspired. perhaps down the road when some of the vague song sketches on this cd had been flushed out in a live setting, these recordings may have proven interesting from an archival perspective. but i can't see any good reason for them to release this at this time... oh wait, there always one good reason, the might dollar. what a shame. what a copout. what a sellout."
4,Yes.,"Do the boys sound excited to be jamming in the same Round Room again, especially on Walls of the Cave? Yes.Is this album rough and spontaneous-sounding? Yes.Are some tracks a bit wussy? Yes.Are Trey's vocals in bad need of overdubbing? Yes.Would it have been better as an instrumental album? Yes, except for Walls of the Cave.Are you better off buying any of the LivePhish series first? Yes.Are the jams excellent and evocative of their live sound? Yes.Will I buy anything they release because they are still the best band in the land? Yes.Do I need extras for L.A. and Vegas because I got shut out of mail order? Yes."
2,Lack of Phish creativity and originality,"Solid jams filter through most songs on this album. Very easy on the ears as far as simple chord structures and basic rock and roll tunes. But, this CD lacks the Phish creativity and originality that makes Phish Phish. It seems like they got together for 4 days, came up with some new riffs, decided to add words, recorded these jams, and made a CD out of a jam session. The Epic tunes that take you through many emotions such as YEM, Reba, Antelope, and many others may be history."
2,Waiting for the Tour,"Most of what I dislike on this album has already been said, sounds unfinished, forced, etc. so I won't get into a long review. That being said, this album has only a couple of tunes that I have found enjoyable. I hope as time goes by I find others. Until then, let the tour begin!"
3,First listen,"Upon first listening to this album, I'm not very impressed. I am an avid Phish phan, but this just doesn't bring to me what I like most regarding their music. I'm fond of Billy Breathes and A Story of the Ghost because they embody the Phish sound but bring it in and tie it tighter, plus, they are brilliantly produced. This album just sounds thrown together in a few days, which it was, so I guess I should have expected it. Still good, just not what I want."
2,The Disappointment of Round Room,"I was greatly disappointed when I sat down and listened to Phish's new CD, Round Room. I was obviously very excited for its release, since the band has not put out a studio album in two years. However, I'm sad to say that Phish has moved in a different direction from their previous albums.The vocals are raw, even weak, and the jamming is incoherent. I believe there should at least be one great song on every CD, but as hard as I tried, I could not find one on Round Room. My advice is not to buy this album. I find it painful to sit through the entire CD, and one can only hope that Phish won't play any of these new songs one their upcoming tour."
2,Not your typical Phish music in my opinion...,"I picked up ""Round Room"" this afternoon. Now I'm not a die-hard Phishead by any means, but I do enjoy their music, particularly Page's awesome keyboard work as I play keyboards myself. Anyway, my personal favorite Phish albums are those from Junta up to Hoist, and it seems like every album released after Hoist has seemed to be just a little more ""un-Phishlike"" than the album before, and Round Room, in my opinion, is no exception. To me, comparing ""Round Room"" to albums like ""Picture of Nectar"" and ""Rift"" is just like comparing DMB's ""Everyday"" to his ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" and ""Crash"" albums...that signature sound from the earlier albums just seems to be missing in the later albums. I didn't find anything particularly appealing on Round Room, which is a big difference from Phish's earlier albums on which I really like pretty much every track. But that's just my two cents..."
2,where's the old energy?,"I have been a phish fan for a long time and enjoyed their concerts more than any other band. Hearing aboutthe return of phish and the release of a new album made me very excited. This new album unfortunately is pitiful in comparison to previous efforts. The fun loving goofy phish lyrics of the past are replaced by boring, unclever songwriting. There is also a complete absence of an impressive jam/composition like ""Run"", or ""Reba"", or ""Guyute"", ""Hood"" etc etc etc etc. Where is the effort? Nothing special whatsoever. I still love them and will travel to see them anyday, BUT this better not be the final studio effort...."
2,The album that made me stop reccomending Phish,"This album is a waste of time. Phish could have paid attention to song structure, innovation, and technique, but instead, they simply jumped the gun and release a pile of sub par songs that have no tension and release as they used to in the older days of Phish. Walls of the Cave could have been interesting if, number one, the jam actually went anywhere instead of pleaying the same chord over and over, and two, if a sizeable part of it wasn't such a blatant Genesis ripoff. There are also songs on here that belong on Trey's crappy solo albums that are simply music for people that posess but one criteria for a good song: that you can dance to it. This album is shallow music and sadly, marks the end of my support of Phish."
2,?????,What happened to the rocking jams? A little disappointed by the slowness of this album. Hopefully the tour will be a little more lively. Good album to slow dance to I guess.
2,disappointed,"i love love jam bands, especially phish. but i do not love this album. anyone who knows anything about phish knows that this band's specialty is their live performances and not their studio albums. i'd prefer to listen to a live phish cd any day over one of their studio albums. but, as a huge phish fan i of course bought their new album to hear what i'd be hearing at future shows and i do not like it. this is the first time that i have picked up one of phish's new cd's and actually not looked forward to hearing one of the songs live. I was so siked to hear the stuff that phish has been doing over hiatus and i was expecting something really sick but instead it was just disappointing."
4,Impulse,"One word to describe every negative review here. I thought most Phish fans had an ear for good music? Oh wait, that was back in '94, my bad. I too was tempted to bash the band after listening to this album for the first time. After 4 or 5 listens I realized that this album is a heartfelt piece of ""spur of the moment"" music. Fishman and Page shine with the boys harmonizing as well as I've heard. It's the ""rushed"" feeling that makes this album work. No excuses needed to give this one a good review. And please don't review until you've REALLY listened....."
3,"well....is that all you got trey, mike, page and fish?","After a hiatus of about 2 years this is the first album from phish's : The Story of the ghost. (I strongly feel that Farmhouse is not a phish album but rather Trey's 1st solo album with a little help). As an established ""phan"" from 1994 to present this is a weak album from phish. Maybe it has not settled in yet, being rather early but i feel no musical magic. Unlike Junta which had masterpieces such as div sky, yem, contact and bowie this album seems to be sloppy at points. I feel that Trey wanted to hurry up and put something out, a wrong move. I love phish and that is why i am coming down hard on this album, trust me i know i do on shows i have seen in the past. I think that 2003 will prove to be a great year musically live for phish but if they want to produce magic go see them live because if you based the upcoming tour on this album it would be in one word: BUNK!"
3,"a good cd, but not what you'd expect from phish","round room is a good cd, i'll give it that, but it's not a good phish cd. this shows how incredible the band is that round room can be called not their best work because if any other band had put it out, it would be amazing. compared to a picture of nectar, junta, and their countless live shows, i thought this cd was disappointing. pebbles and marbles (track 1) was my favrite becuase of the long jam and upbeat feel. the other songs were just too slow and mellow, which is good sometimes but not for an entire cd. if you're a phish fan, you should buy this album, just don't expect to get their best work."
3,unrealized potential,"This CD has some good stuff on it, but it could have been so much better had they taken their time and actually learned the songs before recording them. This album really does sound like it was thrown together in 4 days and that this was the first time the band had played the songs together. Some of the vocals are just embarrassingly bad, as are some of the lyrics. The high points however, are pretty good: Pebbles & Marbles, Seven Below, 46 Days, Waves. If you're a big fan of the band, it's worth buying, otherwise, skip it."
2,What were they thinking??,"Trey & co. must've had precious little time for this one. The whole thing sounds rushed - hacked out in the studio and almost NO production whatsoever, it is a LONG departure from Farmhouse (Farmhouse is probably Phish's studio gem, IMHO). Sorry guys, they can't all be winners... One note, though - ""46 Days"" is a good cut, but I wouldn't spend the whole $15 on one song. Buy it used if you want to experiment."
3,"Not bad, but not Trey.","I too, like many other reviewers, was turned off by this album at first. Then again, I didn't like Lawn Boy right away either, but I gave it a chance and it grew on me. The same thing happened here.But listening to this, and then listening to Trey's solo album, the quality is vastly different. Trey's dynamics and musical styling on his solo kick the hell out of anything on Round Room and it makes me wonder how long Phish will stay together <knock on wood>.Of course, all these worries go away when I see them live. They are so energized from the eager crowds, dying for their music, that they break new barriers.So if your looking to get into Phish, this isn't the album for you. Try Hoist or Rift. Those are the way in."
3,Jam after Jam after Jam after JAM!!!,"Ok we get it. You can Jam. This CD and Phish are ok. Not my favorite..probably wounld NOT buy any of their CDs, but not audio noise either."
4,New Phish Album,"Great CD. Phish's first release since Farmhouse came out in 2000 is mellow and relaxed. They jam out songs much more than on any of their previous studio albums, especially the first and last tracks. Pebbles and Marbles has the potential to be extraordinary live. 46 Days speeds things up a little bit, but overall the album is slower. Reminiscent of Billy Breathes in some ways. Mock Song, Waves, and Anything But Me also stand out. A must buy."
2,Phish has nothing left to say,"Phish has become the masters of making money for nothing. After releasing a flurry of live albums, they offer up this CD touting the fact that it was put together in four days.Well let me be the first to say; it sounds like it.The songs have no soul, little groove, and the lyrics frequently sound like a feeble attempt at the rhyme game (""what rhymes with 'burned'?...'learned'...OK, let's go with that"").It is unfortunate, because I expected that their time apart would help them incorporate their new influences into the band. But I don't hear it.All of their studio albums (aside from Farmhouse) have offered interesting twists on the Phish sound. This one offers nothing new, nothing interesting.As the title says...I'm starting to wonder if Phish has anything left to say."
3,Proper lure yeilds small catches,"3 1/2Striving to recreate their special live appeal, the production is mainly in vain due to RR containing some of the wondrous jammer's weaker songwriting. Even so, extended solos and instrumental convergence have more merit then usual studio treatment, and the title track alone is an example of the powerful gifts hidden underneath a lackluster Buffett-esque presence."
1,Never Really Gets Going,"I love Phish music and don't bash stuff just for perverse fun. I also own and enjoy all their other studio releases.But honestly, this is not a good cd. It never really gets going. Each song sounds like a laidback intro. I kept waiting for the ""real song"" to kick in. After a few minutes the next ""intro"" starts. It sounds to me like Trey and Mike are trying so hard not to get in each others way that they end up doing nothing. And the lyrics. Yikes. Frequently a little loopy, here they are embarassingly hippy-dippy.I guess this is a glimpse into why it ended."
3,simma down now,"OK, so this album isn't the best phish album ever. I mean I really could have done without ""mexican cousin"" and ""friday"". That being said there isn't a common thread that ties the whole album together. It kind of sounds cut and pasted. But if you look at the circumstances of which it was recorded, it shines a different light upon the album. I have to admit that I was a little dissapointed the first time I heard it(I was expecting another ""blow me away"" cd like trey's solo album). Now that I have listened to it a few times it's beginning to grow on me. I love ""46 days"" and ""round room"" is so melodic and relaxing that it gives me chills. ""Walls"", ""Waves"", and ""Pebbles and Marbles"" give a real good taste of what a phish show is like. All in all it's a good cd, it's not great, but it'll do until I can find me a ticket to a show."
3,Where is Phish?,"Long time Phish phan and I must say that this CD is not what I would expect to hear from Phish. It is slow and it lacks the energy that Phish puts into every show and CD. If you are looking for your 1st Phish CD, this in not it. If you are a longtime phan, be ready to listen for a few times before you acquire the taste of this new piece of Phish."
2,"Not bad, but they could have much better","Ok, i know that most fans are dissapointed with Round Room and i cant say that im not. However, I cant say the cd is a complete loser. Maybe its because I havent heard them since they went on hiatus. But in any case, there are some songs that are delightful to listen to. ""46 Days"" is an amazing song though it does seem it needed more time in the recording studio. The bottom line- If you have the money and nothing better to spend it on, get Round Room. If not, dont bother."
3,well....?,"So you're thinking ""Ghost"", ""Farmhouse"", what will the next progression be?! Well, we don't know yet. The manner in which this album was recorded is pretty obvious. Quickly. If we didn't know the story behind it, I don't think the reviews would be as flattering. There are definitely some strong songs, they're just unfinished, and Trey's voice is certainly not at its' best. But..,once you get over the initial shock of the non-production, it starts to grow on you. ""46 days"" is currently stuck in my head, and I loved ""Round Room"" right away. ""Seven Below"" harkens back, and...blah, blah, blah. Just get it 'cause you got to!"
2,What's with all the sap?,"This album has five pretty great songs; Pebbles and Marbles which has sappy, stupid lyrics but an amazing jam that makes up for it; Seven Below, which has sappy, stupid lyrics but a great jam; 46 Days, which is one of the best Phish songs ever; Walls of the Cave which has stupid, but not sappy lyrics and an amazing jam that makes up for it; and the concluding track, Waves, which is altogether fantastic. Just for the record, I'm a huge Phish fan. The songs Gordon wrote, Round Room and Friday, flat out ""are bad"". All the other songs ""are bad"" in the way the song Billy Breathes ""is bad"". So, some of the jams are great. But overall, this album ""is bad"". I really wanted it to be a good one and now I'm ashamed for having been such a huge fan in the past. Hopefully they'll still be good live."
3,A little too limited in category,"This book would've ordinarily been a very good book, however, with a few of the same kinds of books available at the same time, I believe that you should shop around before purchasing this one. I have looked at several with the same theme and have found that ""Asian Greens"" is more concise and lists 3x more vegetables than this book and offers 30 more recipes than this book. Yes the pictures are very beautiful but so are the ones in ""Asian Greens"". For an informative guide, I would have to go with ""Asian Greens"" -- unfortunately, I picked up this one first and have since bought ""Asian Greens"" to help me pick Asian vegetables at the markets."
1,obfuscatory,"The book tries to make things simple and fails miserably. The round-about explainations are confusing. The maladroit, verbose language obfuscates what they are trying to impart. (It's curious that the 5th edition I looked at is often clearer than this 8th edition, and it's shorter too.) What ahould be simple and direct is convolved (no pun intended) into meandering examples unworthy of the name, the point of which often a mystery even to those who are very experienced with ODEs, and obfuscatory verbosity. I'm baffled as to how they book's author (or anyone) thought this might be a useful style. If you are a Professor, then please be nice to the kids and don't use this. If you are a student, I strongly recommend you buy an additional textbook; it would amaze me to see anyone learn ODEs from this; it should be at least possible, albeit difficult, to learn the subject from a textbook alone."
1,Too hard,"The book uses weird symbols than what I am used to. Hard language to understand. I wouldn't recommend it to another person. The book I recommend is Ordinary Differential Equations by Morris Tenenbaum and Harry Pollard. They use symbols we learned in college and don't throw you into a loop by saying "" what did they mean by that?"" Personally, I don't like someone stuffing something down people's throat without explaining in detail what they mean in plain terms. I found their language unfriendly."
3,"Ah, DE's","This book is only OK. I don't really care for the writing or examples. Luckily I had a great instructor. In fact, if I had a bad instructor then this book would only get 2 stars. It deserves that because hey, it is teaching you differential equations!"
1,this book is a disgrace to mathematics,"If I didn't have better things to live for, I would dedicate my life to hating this book. It's TERRIBLE! Visual learners shudder and linguists are baffled left and right. The examples don't match up AT ALL with the exercises and the book is not succinct at all, whatsoever. There is no elegance. This book is a disservice to mathematics. PLEASE, if your instructor requires this book, CHANGE INSTRUCTORS."
4,Differential Equations,"Sometimes this book, like all books at this high of level, can be a bit convoluted. In the authors attempt to stay professional at all times they rarely explain things in a way that is understandable to an everyman. However with a decent instructor this book should be fine. The homework sets at the end of sections are good as they range from quite easy to, in some cases, mind-blowingly difficult. As I understand it, this book is very popular in Diff EQ classes, and for good reason."
2,Fails at teaching,"Explanations are difficult to understand, and the example problems for each section are insufficient for demonstrating the topic. There are no solutions to the exercises in the back of the book, only answers. If you want to learn diff eq., I would recommend using Pauls Online Notes and your instructor's lectures. This book fails to teach students how to solve problems."
2,Not for Visual Learners,"I used this book in my Intro to Diff Eq class. Appreciation of this book requires a good understand of physics, which I, admittedly, do not have. The explanations are not always straightforward because they are bogged down in complicated proofs. Nothing is stated succinctly or summarized. My biggest issue with this text is that it lacks sufficient visualizations of ideas (charts, graphs, etc). I had to sketch the ideas as best as I understood them as I went through the material, a laborious process."
1,Just burned CD,"Thought this was the book, and it was just a solutions manual CD...and it was a burned CD at that...Definately illegal."
3,Decent Textbook,"I have not had the experience to study other differential equations texts, and so in a sense I don't have a broader context in which I can evaluate this text, but I can say a few things with a reasonable degree of certainty:Strengths: Practice problems are diverse, interesting, in tremendous abundance, and virtually every answer (even and odd) is in the back of the book. Logically ordered and rigorous. Probably much more material than could be covered in one semester.Weaknesses: At times the explanations of the concepts are much murkier than they need to be. Too much emphasis is placed upon a formulaic approach, when a more hands-on, conceptual approach is appropriate.Over all it's a decent text book, but I'd urge caution when reading the posts that call it the greatest thing since sliced bread."
1,Can you call this a textbook??,"This book is probably the most horrible textbook I've seen in my life. There are several reasons:1.They introduce new concept in the example, instead of putting them in a box label Definition or Theorem.2.And some consecutive theorems are too trivial to be called theorems, they are more like lemma3.Lacks mathematical rigorousness, most of the time, they just do things without explaining it. (They talk about linear independence and the determinant matrix without introducing some concept from linear algebra. And use operators without going over what they really are)4.The structure of each chapter is sloppy and illogical.Don't buy this book unless it's required for your class"
1,A Feel-Good novella from and for my generation,"This 3 Ivy-League certificated Dickens shop-girl made my life seem Bill Gates-esque in comparison to what she wrote about her life experiences. I didn't rate it higher because Gari recommended it, and I was sooo looking forward to a Lake Woebegon tale from a woman's perspective, NOT!!! And though it is a book about nothing, it wouldn't even make one good episode on Seinfeld. And to the author: You may not ever have had one, but you don't have to be so explicit about it, just PRETEND sometimes!!!!!"
4,Harmonies that take you places,"Highway 9 lyrics,harmonies and instrumentation captures the listener on many levels. The songs deal with change, growth, love and the strength it takes to go thru it. The harmonies are memorable and stay in your head and heart. The instrumentation pulls you up and moving. To compare Highway 9's vocals to Springstein or Henley gives you only an idea how wonderful the sound must be However, the sound is Highway 9's alone rooted in the American landscape no matter where your from you'll find yourself in it............."
5,Joe Nichols,"This CD is incredible not only for country music but I'm a popular and hip-hop music listener too. However I, like Joe, too grew up on country music. I think that Joe truly has the potential to go even farther in life as a country artist and even a possible cross-over artist even if this accomplishment is unintentional. If you haven't heard his new song, ""The Impossible"" make sure you hear it as well. By hearing this voice, we've truly expirienced a God given gift. If these items alone aren't enough, he's really hot too!"
2,I like his stuff,But this cd is really not that good. I never ever ever listen to this. I don't even have it ripped onto my computer. The CD just sits in a shelf. I think I might toss it.His newer stuff is good though!
2,cell phone cover,"I really did not not this product. I kept thinking my phone was going to fall out, but it stayed in. Then again I had an extended battery. Deliver was on time."
5,"Great book, not necessarily just for pros","I am not a professional plumber and am in the midst of a forced renovation. I have read other plumbing books but none addressed retrofit plumbing as this one does. The way he described procedures, such as installing new shut-off valves gave me the confidence to at least undertake such a project. I am better able to see the whole picture of how a repair fits into or affects the overall system. His coverage of Pex pipe made it possible for me to consider replacing the feed to a second storey bathtub; the current copper climbs the wall at a 5 to 10 degree angle making it impossible to correctly fit the faucets to the wall."
5,"Excellent book, covering all the bases","I am a DIYer with a fair amount of experience -- however I am new the the world of plumbing. This book is well-written, logically organized, and easy to read. It covers the important basic stuff in great detail to get novices pointed in the right direction (how to sweat pipes, pros/cons of different types of pipe material, etc), yet contains tons of tips and tricks for the experienced amateur/pro for all phases of common tasks. This is the plumbing book that I crack open first when I need to look something up. Highly recommended."
2,title misleading,"The book is called Remodel Plumbing, but doesn't really cover remodeling. It has a lot of good tips and techniques on plumbing, but says next to nothing about how to install a bathtub (how to frame it in, etc). I was very disappointed with this book."
5,recommended for home owners,"I recently purchased this book. I purchased it together with Black and Decker's ""the complete guide to plumbing"". I highly recommend this book for home owners.Hers' the most important feature. It tells you what are the most common mistakes that you will make AND that you will find in your house. The problems with other books is that they presume that any plumbing done in your house will be perfect and done to code. If you have ever done any repairs in your house you know that this is NEVER the case. I was so pleased with this book that I also order ""wiring a house"" by the same author. i like the fact that it is written by an actual author with 3 generations of experience and not by a team. Somebody who has been out there can tell you what you usually find and most of all how to fix it."
2,Disappointed,"After having read his book on Wiring, I was expecting this to be a great book. But I was disappointed. Does not cover how to install or replace a hot water heater other than a few tips."
3,average,I give 3 stars because this book has several tips but missing the whole picture. I read all the good reviews and bought the book but I'm a little disappointed.
5,superb book,"I've been reading all the books on plumbing. Whether you are remodeling or not, this is absolutely the best book I've read - full of tips, accurate, and up-to-date."
3,Good,"Lots of good information, well written. Some of the website references provide in back no longer work, or not very helpful."
4,A must have read before starting,"Book is well structured, takes you thru the different steps, what to take into account. Pleasant professional reading book. Most references/internet links etc. are for the North America market."
4,good but...,this is an ok b-ville c.d but don't conpare to some of the others.i like live from pensacola and send the fire better.buy this for we will ride and let it rain
5,Anointed,"Lindell Cooley is full of the Spirit of God in this wonderful anointed cd. I use this for my personal worship time and really like it. Even though I did not get to go to the Brownsville Revival, I feel like I am a part of it every time I listen to this cd!"
2,Not as nice in person and the sizing is all wrong,"I was really excited to receive these shoes because from the website pictures, they look great! Unfortunately, when they arrived I was SO dissappointed. They are downright clumsy and awkward looking, the material is so rough and the sizing is all wrong. I buy a lot of Skecher's shoes, all in size 11M, but these shoes (labeled 11M) were barely a size 10.5, and they are so narrow they hurt wearing them. Mine are going back to Amazon."
5,"The Underground Railroad in Floyd County, Indiana","Having been born in Floyd County, Indiana, I often wondered what role Indiana, being a border state, playedduring the unfortunate period of civil war in America. Thistreatise so eloquently presented, answered many of the questions I often asked myself before I was able to sink deeply into this discourse. Thank you Pam Peters, for I now know many of my ancestors aligned themselves with good and fought diligently on the side of freedom and against the evils of human bondage. And, were able to accomplish much, despite the transgressions and oppression that were visited upon them."
3,Towel for specific uses,"This towel is lightweight, very absorbent, dries quickly and packs into a small space. On the downside it is very thin (although certainly sturdy enough) and because of its design has a slick feel to it that becomes worse when it is wet from drying yourself. Feels like you're drying with wax paper. Not to be confused with the feel of a Turkish towel but for specific uses/needs it can be great."
4,Excellent reception - very portable,"I bought the Roady without knowing much about it. The SkyFi seemed too pricey, and the price for the car kit was outrageous. I went with the Roady because of the lower price for getting it into the car.Once I put the Roady in the car, I loved it so much I wanted to listen to it at home. I found at a home kit wasn't available (that's why only four stars). By doing a little research on the web, I found that as long as you were able to move the antenna from your car to your home, it was an easy fix if you have decent stereo speakers and a universal power supply.I now listen to the Roady in between Morgantown and Pittsburgh, PA all the time, and it's a delight to be able to hear the rebroadcast of all the Sunday talk shows on C-Span Radio in the afternoon.If the roady had a home kit available (with a second antenna) and it came with a remote (although the extra $15 is reasonable) it would be perfect.I highly recommend it."
4,A Happy Ending - Gervais Style,"I was very happy to be watching this series final for Extra's and felt that it delivered the kind of wrap up I was hoping for. There are lots of teeth grindingly difficult to watch bits - so as long as you have a cushion to hide behind you'll be fine. The special starts where the second series finished with our anti-hero, Gervais, still feeling hard done by regarding his successful TV show.Gervais doesn't let up on himself here and his character moves through a steady downward spiral until his C grade status as a performer is fully realised on Celebrity Big Brother. The final scene in the BB house is worth the price of the entire DVD.I won't go on and on, it's good. I don't think that it cops out and there is some very funny, and stinging stuff in there. Including an amusing cameo from George Michael."
3,No Extra Cruel Reality,"I had not seen The Extras so this The Special (Final) looked as an explicit exhibitionism of a commoner made it to the top of a show-business and back while arrogance and lack of elementary human gratitude had been forgiven by those he shitted on from the top of his career for his tiers and, perhaps, similarities of other extras themselves a major character originated from."
3,OH YEAH!!,i think that this album represents the time that most people believe was the best i love all these songs!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Same ole, same ole..","Can we have an 80s 12 inch compilation that doesn't re-hash the same things that are on at least 15 other similar various artists cds? This one is no exception to the rule..Most of these titles i have at least 1 copy of them, if not 2-3, in addition to having them on some various artists cds. These guys go for the big bang and only put on stuff recognizable to the average punter, who's knowledge of dance music extends little beyond the contemporary hit radio top 40 hits of the time period. Shame, cuz there is a lot of 12 inch dance music out there to be un-earthed, and nobody has done it..Don't get me wrong, these are sturdy, great songs and quality mixes thru-out..but i'm frustrated with only finding the most common titles every time i look at a various artist cd like this.."
5,"C'era un Ragazzo, Gianni Morandi","This is Gianni Morandi at his singing best with many of his hits. For 2 Cds, however, I find 24 songs a small number."
4,My 1st grade class liked it!,"Comet is a cat living in a dog-run world (doesn't life suck there?) where he meets misfortune after misfortune. Fortunately, he is a cat and therefore has nine lives--he just happens to be loosing them at an alarming rate.It's a sweet, quirky story that admittedly does not have much on plot. But the kids had fun predicting how each new situation would kill Comet. I have never seen macabre in a cuter way, and that's always a plus. Despite all the fun deaths, we are still left wondering if Comet will make it out alive and live happily ever after or lose all nine lives.Much of the story is told in the illustrations, and I appreciated that as it got the kids thinking. And, as always, Jan Brett's illustrations are gorgeous.If the kids are fighting over this book during free reading time, that's a good sign. And teacher enjoys a little macabre herself.Great job."
3,"Great Pictures, Okay Story","Very beautiful Nantucket influenced illustrations, but I am not compelled to own it compared to many other of Brett's books, due to the story,and I am a cat lover. The flow seemed choppy from page to page as the cat ""dies"" each one of eight of his nine lives in various ways."
1,A little macabre,"Sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but I was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book. Maybe I should have expected such based on the title, but I found it unsettling nonetheless."
1,Death is not charming,"I agree with the reviewer who found this macabre. Normally I like Jan Brett's work a lot, but I don't think that death should be portrayed as cute and funny, nor do I think that young children should be given the impression that death is a temporary state."
1,Basic information for newbies,"I am a warehouse professional, I purchsed this in order to increase my knowledge but it was not really suitable to me. It would be useful to somebody who has never worked in the warehousing industry before but if your already a warehouse professional it's of very little use. Its very dated in respect of drawings and images and realy could do with an update. One key area missing from Warehouse books in general is detailed business cases and templates, this is no different."
2,far too basic,"I was wishing a more specialized book, especially where inventory management comes, but it has so many topis that each one is very basic"
3,Packaging to Australia,"My book arrived today, but it was very poorly packaged for a consignment to Australia. The cardboard was sealed only with a single strip of paper tape which had broken and the package had to be re-sealed with real tape by the Australian post office. Photo available. Fortunately the book was intact, but there was no paperwork, receipt or packing slip which have fallen out of the open package, but I do require it. Hopefully a real person will read this and send me a duplicate.Thankyou."
5,A Very Helpful Book on Dealing with Marriage Problems,"I've read a number of self-help books on marriage, and this is the best by far. The ""Dummies""-style organization makes the book extremely user-friendly. I can find useful information on just about any aspect of marriage--whether it's dealing with in-laws, disputes over money, love-making issues, or dividing up household chores.Drs. Sue and Steve Simring are not only experts on the subject of marriage and skilled writers. They also bring the in-the-trenches wisdom of their own thirty year marriage to the table. Reading ""Making Marriage Work For Dummies"" gives me a real sense of what it takes to keep my relationship strong, and deal with problems as they come up.Highly recommended!"
5,bought this as a gift,"I bought this for my mother and new husband's wedding present. His 4th marriage, her 3rd. thought it was appropriate considering how many times they haven't been able to make it work. the thank you card was late to come, but I did eventually receive one :) She says there is some helpful info in the book but I didn't read any of it so I can't personally vouch for it. But the price was good and it was shipped quickly and packaged well."
3,A blues album tride and true,"The brainchild of Jamie Oldaker, Mad Dogs & Okies is a collection of artists, musicians, and writers that are wither from Oklahoma of have been involved of influenced by Oklahoma music over the years. It includes artist such as Vince Gill, Eric Clapton, Peter Framton, Taj Mahal, and Willie Nelson. The song selection is a combination of original material and covers. Some songs work (""Promises"") and some don't (""Can't Find My Way Home""). One things for sure, it a blues album tride and true."
4,good game,"tsugunai maynot be the best rpg game out there. but this game has great gaphics, and fun gameplay."
1,This game... is bizzare... and bad as well.,"Ok, I don't know what the producers of this game were thinking when they decided to make a story about a man trapped inside a womans body. Now that's a blue ribbon winner!!! Seriously though, this game is lacking in all possible categories. DO NOT buy this game."
5,Important Historical Perspective on the Vietnam War,"I reviewed another of Stockdales writings and then found this and while its not for everyone, it is outstanding. Great perspective from an incredible warrior for our country.It is written as a compilation of essays, has a little redundancy because of that but I read it in one setting. We can learn a great deal about the war and about how one human being approached captivity.Great work."
2,"flawed, incomplete selections","James is wonderful and to the extent that this volume contains many of his important writings, it is wonderful. However, because the volume does not include the crucial ""Essays in Radical Empiricism"" or the key chapters/essays from either ""Principles of Psychology"" or ""The Will to Believe"" it is very incomplete. Readers interested in James would do better to pick up a copy of the ""Writings of William James"" edited by John J. McDermott (whose own introduction to James is also far superior to that of the editor of this volume)."
2,Very Biased.,"This book is fine if you want a very concise explanation of different topics in economics, however in many sections it is obviously very biased. Instead of offering only the facts and analyses it deliberately attempts to persuade the reader into siding with the authors view on topics. eg the section on inflation repeatedly refers to inflation as ""theft"" and ""stealing"". Although some may in fact agree with the wording, when teaching economics the author should attempt to stay as neutral as possible. In summary, although the book is fine for the initial explanation of each topic in economics, it is very biased towards one school of though or another. Would not recommend for those wanting a real education in economics as the author often displays only on point of view on topics."
4,Grub Line Rider,"I thought it was exciting. It moved right along, Always had a surprise.It had suspense right up till the end."
5,Louis L'Amour is always a good read,"This is a good book as all L.L. books are. The places he describes are real, and he's experienced a lot of life so makes his books good."
1,"If you can't sound like them, sound like yourself","There are a more than a few FM tribute albums out there, and although I'm not much of a fan of them and don't like how the wanna-be's try to make money off of a band that is alive and rocking, I have to admit there are a few decent ""tributes"" on the market for FM. I came across a decent one tonight, and THIS IS NOT IT. The lead singer is flat, tries to imitate Stevie's and Christie's voice, but falls quite short (even on her face - did people encourage her a little too much in her singing? Sometimes when listening to these albums I note that although they aren't the real thing (who can ever be but the originals?), they could do well with their own works. Sorry to the singers on this, but if singing lessons are in the future and not insulting the real band by the ""tribute"", you could have a future. I just don't understand how this one passed inspection."
2,not one of her best books,"I feel she jumped around in the story a lot. I got lost after the prologue. I like the idea and point of the story, that a woman and a man from two different worlds could fall in love, but how it happens is a little far fetched. I did not like it that well, but someone else might."
4,An Older Book Worth Searching For,"There are two main threads of interest in this novel. The first is the strange overlay of Western law enforcement methods on the earlier Japanese equivalent of how to run down the perpetrator of a homicide. The second is that of a dysfunctional family and how it continues to function in a society that is still partly the Japan of the ronin era but now definitely emersed in the twenty-first century. As a psychological mystery, this one is first rate. As a ""whodunnit"" it will probably disappoint the average Western reader, with an ending that is really surprising but hard to accept as possibly happening."
1,Stupid premise for a work of fiction,"While the setting of the story is interesting, the basic premise of the book is stupid. There are too many characters in the books and because it is a translation, whatever possible charm or interest in could have had in the original Japanese has been lost. It was so horrible and confusing, I found it implausible and impossible to read to the end."
5,Don't 'get' monads? Get Jolley.,"Leibniz can be frustrating; there's no question about that. But Jolley's introduction to Leibniz's work goes a long way toward clarifying many of Leibniz's core doctrines. One thing I find difficult in Leibniz's works is the apparent absence of arguments. Often, it feels as if Leibniz is making statements, not arguments, and the intervening inferences are left to the reader. Jolley takes note of this fact, and on many occasions provides possible constructions of supporting arguments. Additionally, Jolley draws heavily on contemporary literature on Leibniz. This makes it easier to find one's way into the current debates in Leibniz scholarship. Oh, and the book is very readible, as well."
2,Not recommended,"We purchased this projector three years ago for our basement theater room. Was ok as a beginner projector, but not great. We bought an extended warranty plan for three years and about two weeks after the warranty ran out started having problems with it turning on. Had to send it to an approved Epson repair and was told that the power assembly needed to be replaced for a cost of $400. They also said the bulb needed to be replaced, when we only had about 800 hours on it. The tech said that you can't just go by the hours on the lamp because ours had black burn marks on it and the picture quality was being affected. Since a replacement bulb is another two hundred dollars we decided to purchase another projector. This time we went with a sony and can't believe the difference, it's far and above better than the Epson. Unless you want to buy a new projector in a few years I would stay away from this one."
5,Not bad!,"Ordered this for a Halloween Costume party, and was not let down. This particular CD has several Halloween-themed tracks from various films all done by strings, which makes it unique in sound. It adds a nice, eerie feeling to your setting, which is great if that's what you're aiming for. The CD came brand new, and never skipped once during the duration of its playing cycle. I would recommend this product to others looking for potential Halloween music, or just whenever music to indulge the Horror fan within you!"
3,A Little Over Priced...?,"We sent these as a Christmas gift to family. Unfortunately, from the response we received ...not at all impressed... the cookies and box were not quite up to what was shown in the picture. It didn't make us feel very good and I don't think we will be using them again in the future unfortunately."
1,Would not recommend this watch company,I purchased the Activa Midsize Two-Tone Multi-function Digital Watch #AD046-002 in the autumn my kid for Christmas. When he opened it was not functioning. I returned the watch and paid the $10 for repair of the watch as per the instructions. Activia cashed my check but never returned my watch. The telephone number that I was provided was disconnected and the email that I sent was never returned. I would not recommend this watch company.
1,Doggie Dooley,"I bought this on the advise of a friend who loves and uses this product. This was not the case for me. I found that the dooley smelled awful despite using the waste terminator that is recommended. Ultimately, after about four months of nastiness, I dug the whole system out of the ground and tossed it."
3,great concept for some soils,Be sure you use this in a well drained soil area otherwise it doesn't work very well. Easy to use.
2,"Good idea, difficult to install, lots of maintenance, plastic lid","We've been using this doggie dooley for over a year. Digging a hole 4 feet deep without making it too wide was very difficult! Since our hole was just a bit too wide, the dooley is slowly sinking into the ground somewhat over time. Also, the plastic lid has a crack now -- we don't know how that happened. But it means the air around the dooley is a little smelly. Finally, I find it hard to collect waste and add water as often as is ideal. I'm glad we're keeping fecal waste out of the landfill, but I feel the design could be better.UPDATE: We finally dug up and threw out the whole thing. The lid was plastic - bad idea! It cracked and broke over time. The smell was horrible. A waste of time and money."
2,Didn't work in my soil,"I tried the Dooley 3000 septic system, and had it installed as per the directions exactly...however, the soil here did not cooperate. So not only does it not work, more than once I've found the thing open and stinking since, even though it is out of the way, the lid is easily stepped on when they are playing in the yard and charging around. Now I am going to have my yard guy fill it in or cover it up in some way since I can't imagine how to get it OUT of the ground at this point...which also makes returning it rather impossible.If you are on a sewer line, I'd recommend the Doggie Doo Drain instead, also available from Amazon, and at $44bucks, it's cheaper and works a treat. Especially if you have heavy clay soil with poor drainage as was my case, or live in cold climates...it works ALL YEAR ROUND. An added plus is that it does not require enzymes or ongoing maintenance whatsoever. I have two large labs and keeping their yard ready for play has never been easier."
3,smelly,I have had one of these in the past and it never smelt so bad. I am not sure what the problem is but I would not recommend it
4,it works,Been up and running for about a month and working fine with no odors . Would have given a 5 but the lid a little flimsy.
2,Sinkhole,"We had used the pyramid style doggie dooley for years until the lid broke off well below where you would attach a new lid, thus making the whole thing useless. We cut down the top and buried it.We replaced the old doggie dooley with the #3000. After 18 months, the whole thing collapsed into the hole. We never could get this one ""digesting"". The solids built up in the tank and I believe the added weight made the whole thing collapse. Not happy with the product this time around.Now we are faced with digging it out of the ground. We plan to make a larger flange out of plywood to slip over the doggie dooley before we replace it in the ground. Hopefully this will work. Since I have to clean out the whole thing to get it out of the hole, I'll try restarting it again. Hopefully it will work this time.We have one lab on high end dog food so the stools are relatively small and hard."
4,doggie dooley 3000,"We needed another Dooley in a new location. The last one worked out really well. Hey,it's good to have a place for that stuff. The packet works as long as you remember to keep it watered."
4,Dog Septic System,"Wow this was difficult to install. The directions said to dig a 48"" hole... I gave up after about 36 as I couldn't reach any further in.I have two large dogs and the top portion quickly fills up but then when you add water it flushes the waste down into the huge hole underneath. There is still a smell and flies buzz around it constantly but it's better than bagging or having a pile elsewhere in the yard and I really don't know how your dog waste could be better disposed of.You do have to committ to this product, first the install... it's not easy to dig that hole (you can't have too wide of a top opening to your hole) and once it's in, you have to clean your yard constantly rather than waiting til the weekend for best results.I would recommed this product."
4,Doom 2=COOL,"I got Doom 2 for Christmas, and it is very very cool! It is the first FPS for a Gameboy seystem i've ever played. You get to fight demons and formor humans. You get shotguns, plasma rifles, a chainsaw, rocket louncher, and lots more weapons!The deamons took over the only spaceport, and you have to open a force field so you and the other servivers can get into space away from the ruined planet."
4,I never thought I'd ever see Doom on a handheld,"Admit it, you never thought you'd ever see Doom (or any first person shooter for that matter) on a handheld, and certainly not on the GameBoy, but what we have here is one hell of a game for the GBA. The graphics are a bit dated, and the enemies look like ants from a little bit away, but this fast paced action shooter is a surprisingly solid GBA title. I only hope the upcoming GBA conversion of Wolfenstein 3-D is as good or better."
5,Still a classic after all these years.,"Let me just start out by saying how much I supremely enjoyed this game. I'm a doom veteran and this game hits the spot. The graphics are mindblowing, I wish I could see them on a bigger screen (You listening Nintendo?). Your jaw drops when you realize that the game's amazing sound is coming out of that one little speaker. The only bad thing about this game is the fact that they took away the two bosses at the end of some stages. Other than that this game is perfect, whether you've played the original or not. I'll tell you plain and simple buy it or you're in for a BIG dissapointment."
4,Doom,I think they did a good job on this one considering it is a Hand Held Game. Graphics are OK and gameplay is fun. The Sound effects kinda suck but I didn't expect them to be top notch. Overall I gave it 4 Stars because the replay value is high and it's a fun game but nothing thats great enough for 5 stars.
2,Que juego mas de vieja chupa concha!,"Pipe Antunez no te compres esta wasca, el chalo se pasa es un divino igual que la vieja de divino y el viejo de manzanares.Pipe que me compro el xbox o el ps2 eh?by the way sos un chupapen aguante el pipe!que loco todo esto no?"
2,Would be better if you could see,"Doom mimics the computer game fairly well, but the game is so dark that you can only play it in direct sunlight. I prefer these type of games where stratagy is more important than reflexes and Doom is true to this form. Only I have eye strain from trying to see what is going on."
2,Dark Doom on a dark display,"I don't know what the other rewievers are writing about, but this is the worst Doom Port. The GBA has the speed, you need for doom, but not the Display. Its mostly dark brown on light black on a non illuminated display - you just can guess what happens. You can only play through, when you know the levels from the original PC-Version (for goods sake they copied the automatic map feature). There are only very few changes for better gameplay on the GBA, such as no moving bridge in Part 1 level 3. Also you can only save after you completed a level. I couldn't find the multiplayer in the menu, but maybe its only visible when you attach a link cable. If you want a really god Doom Port on a Handheld, try the free versions for Pocket PC."
5,A Diffent Point of View,"If you browse the reviews just like I did before I bought the game, then you notice one thing in peticular: Most reviews compare this version of Doom to others (most commonly the PC). I never owned any other version of Doom. I never even played any of them before. So I hope some words from a non-expieenced Doom player will help you.I own many GBA games, but this is by far my best game. The graphics are AMAZING, considering this is a GBA. The sound is EXCELLENT, all the moans, grunts, shrieks, gunshots, doors, and other effects are crisp and clear, and by far the best sound I've ever heard on a GBA. The movement is very fluid (I thought a first person shooter on a handheld system would be slow and jerky). So overall, this is a great game will no flaws.This game is one of the best I have ever seen for this console. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a great time (it is violent, and you must be able to stomach the carnage)."
4,Not exactly the same as.....,"....running Doom on a 486DX 80Mhz 4Mb RAM 14"" like I used to when I was only 22 and together with three other chaps ""re-allocated"" time from our engineering classes to blast each other either with pistols or rocket launchers.Who doesn't remember endless nights in front of your PC fighting fire-launching monsters, grunts and bosses, checking your map trying to find the secret passages, desperately looking for medi-kits and ammo....ahhhh...those were great days!!I won't lie to you, it's not the same on a GBA screen (some scenarios are way too dark) but nevertheless this has brought-up so many great memories that only listening to the score is great fun.Long live to FPS's.Enjoy."
5,"Good, solid game","This is a solid, well bought game with many hours into it. Although Im not sure its worth the 40 dollers when you could download it And play it on your comp.., Id still recommend buying it. The graphics are somewhat pixilated, But the levels are all there, although some are somewhat...modified and some of the bosses seem to be missing. But all of the sound and music is there, And this game has great sound and music. Overall, the game is well worth buying, and in my opinion, one of the FUNNEST games on the gba, Not one of the best, just one of the FUNNEST, And it lasts a long time. BUY IT!"
5,Doom finally makes a return!!!,"I haven't played the game on Gameboy Advance yet, but I have played it on my computer.I remember back a few years ago, that this was my favorite game, and I used to play i for hours.Some say that Doom,t gave birth to first person shooters, it most certainly did.With awesome graphics, and an excellent gameplay which will strike much fear into your hearts, (especially when alone in a room), this game is made for nothing else but have fun.If you are an avid first person shooter fan, then you should definitly get this game.This game features all the classic gameplay and fun from the original game, all packed into a cartrige, for awesome 3D action on the go.The game also features a 4- player arena mode which should be really cool.So if you ask me, you should definitly add this game to your GBA library, for hours of fun.Also all those who cannot wait for Doom 3, should get this game!!!"
5,Somethin' Pumpkin,"I am utterly charmed. No, really I am. This is a gem of little clever rhymes and very clever illustrations to accompany the words. Each word and each brush stroke must have worked in perfect harmony to make this book. It arrived just in time for Halloween and has already been read to the children around here. They loved the made-up words and creatures!We'll go to the pumpkin patch this year to see all of our new friends and bring home an extra one or two, just in case we need to make some perfect pumpkin falafel! Somehow we'll think differently of the ones who may be a little squashed on one side or misshapen on another - maybe they are just back from their squashastic aptitude test.Somethin' Pumpkin is just perfect for little ones, but it is clever enough to keep the grown-ups entertained. Although I am tempted to put this book away at the end of pumpkin season - I think I'll keep it out and recite the rhymes and make faces for a little longer..."
4,Simple elegence,"I always prefer men's watches as they have more character. This watch reached me in perfect condition and I simply love it! Simple yet beautiful, good quality, trustworthy brand, all at an affordable price."
2,Not so Grand.,"A theatrical play, mostly set inside a theatre, with very little to be seen of the Grand Central at all! And not NOIR in the least! Great acting, though in quite a theatrical manner, by Van Heflin, makes it rather fun to watch,after all."
4,"nice, general review of subject matter","This book explains the history, legal, and mechanical aspects of switchblades. I found it to be interesting to the point where I read it in one sitting. Some parts weren't as good as others; however, I do not regret adding a copy to my library."
2,good thing it's cheap,this book is small and author spends half of it on useless babble.Mine has blank pages& misplaced pages.At least one drawing is inacurate.Does not cost much; that is its saving grace.
1,Switchblade -- Ragnar Benson,"One of the few times I have felt that I have truely wasted my money -- I learned more about switchblades by looking at the ones I have. Drawings are minimal, with essential information left to the imagination. Sad that it is not more informative in detail."
2,Switchblade : The Ace Of Blades,Don't bother with this one. The illustrations are poor and there should have been more photographs of interesting knives. The material is very general and sketchy. A book that goes into a great amount of detail on any particular part of the subject would be more interesting and useful. I think most people would prefer a book showing in detail the mechanics of switchblades and some of the pattent drawings. A book about collectable button knives and their values might be popular too. I would like to read more about the Estes Kefauver and the motivations of other people in office that write and pass stupid laws regulating pocket knives.
2,Switchblade: The Ace of Blades,"This book is a re-write of a release from years ago. The book poorly covers the construction of switchblades, it does not cover in any depth the new construction. The chapter on laws pertaining to switchblades provides a very high level overview of the law. It does not provide the reader with any information that isn't currenly avaibale by and online search."
2,Not the same!,"I have purchased this soap before, and what I received was NOT the creamy white, milky, vanilla coconut soap that I have had before. Instead, what I received was a brown in color soap that in NO way smelled of vanilla coconut. Not even close. Very disappointed."
1,...,"This is by far the worst book I have ever needed to read for school ever. When I attempted to read this book, I must've fallen asleep at least 10 times and I haven't even got past the first 2 chapters. I have no idea what my teacher was thinking when he saw this book. If it was a choice, I would choose negative 5 stars for this waste of paper and ink. It is, hands down, a boring book with absolutely not point at all except to critizice the immigration of the early Europeans. It almost seems like Nash couldn't give about the Europeans coming over here. Well, I would be quite upset if they didn't come over here, unless it would have prevented the publishing of his redundant, afwul book."
2,Did not like it,"Not very entertaining, only read pass the second chapter because it was required for a class. The elements of fantasy are not well blended into the story."
2,"New, but not improved","I bought this thing, but I'm sorry I did. It really doesn't do anything as well as the more common and conventional horseshoe-shaped pillows, which will cradle your neck regardless of which way you lean. The Steves pillow doesn't stay on very well, and you are apparently only supposed to lean in one direction. He should be ashamed of lending his name to this thing."
1,HOW CAN YOU CALLE THIS A PILLOW?,"This is the worst travel pillow I have ever seen. There is not symmetry to it and when blown up, the air keeps moving from the 3 channels, (left, right and upper). They are all connected. You would have to see this thing to believe it. I had my fellow plane passengers laughing when they saw me try to use it. The two I purchased ended up in the trash can upon my return from vacation. I can't believe Rick Steves would endorse this thing. The stewardess told me the soft cushiony ones found in airport gift shops are the best. They do not blow up."
1,Uncomfortable!,"Don't buy this pillow! Odd shape makes it impossible to use this pillow as pictured...plus the seams are rough and irratate your neck. I took it on a trip and finally gave up and used the airline pillow. To make it worse, after one use it has a leak and won't hold air! It is not a ""deluxe"" pillow."
5,Great product - good quality,"Very timely shipping.Item fits as it should. Well constructed. Held up nicely for many sessions in pool, ocean. Comforable for scuba or snorkeling.I will buy another."
4,Very good continuation of the Adept series.,I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It tied up some loose endsfrom previous books and contains enough information to fillin the blanks for those with no prior experience with theAdept series. I didn't want to put it down until I wasfinished!
5,100 Bible Songs for Kids,"I bought this for my grandchildren. As I listened to the songs, they reminded me of being in bible school singing these songs and being very happy. The choir is so good and I think children know they are listening to other children singing. It's great, peppy, memorizing music to learn about God's love."
2,warmed-over weather report,"What really struck me on first listening to this, was the superficial resemblance to old Weather Report recordings (this was before I actually got to the WR cover of ""Boogie Woogie Waltz""; I subsequently listened to the original on Sweetnighter, which turned out to be far superior in every way). Part of the problem with this recording seems to be the ... musical ideas expressed on here; subtract Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, and various WR drummers; replace them, and this is what you come up with. I almost had to turn it off when I heard those ""cheezy"" electric keyboard settings on a couple of tracks. A second listen (I always listen at least twice before getting rid of a recording), confirmed my initial assessment. Mr. Mcbride is a monster bass player, but this was almost embarrassing; he would have been much better off actually hooking up with Shorter, Zawinul, and company in a Weather Report revisited project. That would be really good."
2,"""warmed-over weather report"" rides again!","I listened to it again, and I still agree with myself (to paraphrase Billy Bob Thornton). Four different reviewers have made reference to my previous review title, so I must have hit a nerve. No, I hate smooth jazz. I happen to be a drummer (jazz, Indian classical, and Afro-Latin), who basically grew up on Cream, Hendrix, Coltrane, Miles, etc. so I do have a reference point as a listener, and practitioner. Mr. McBride is a monster bass player, as I stated in my previous review, but apparently he does much better playing in other people's bands, with other player's compositions. This is not an unusual situation; there aren't too many great jazz players who are also great composers.I stand by my original review. The original Weather Report tune ""Boogie Woogie Waltz"" is far superior to the cover on this recording; all you need to do is listen to them both. I rest my case!"
3,Just below great,"3 1/2Promising, diverse interplay abound, though it all peaks just below a level of truly becoming momentous."
1,'Serta' ??KoolComfort Memory Foam,"I received this product in good condition although it was not in a Serta package and nothing on it to verify that it actually came from Serta. I purchased two 'original' Serta KoolComfort Memory Foam pillows at a Serta bedding store two months earlier. They are King Size. There was nothing in the Amazon description stating the size of the pillow except the picture when I ordered it. On comparing my Serta pillows with the pillows sent by Amazon, both sets of covers were similar. On examining the interior foam pillow itself there is a MAJOR difference. My original Serta King Size pillows have a Grey color foam where the Amazon pillows have a whitish-yellow foam and are much less pliable than my Serta pillows. This leads me to believe that the pillows Amazon sent me are not the same product as my Serta KoolComfort Memory Foam Molded Pillow. I returned both pillows to Amazon since I do not feel they are the exact item as advertised."
2,Not retail,This item arrived in clear unmarked plastic with no box or tags indicating that it was actually from SERTA. If you're expecting a retail SERTA pillow as I was this is not for you.The zippers on the covers are also very fragile. They may only work once or twice. This on a pillow that is advertised as have interchangable covers.
5,"""Well"" done","This book is a lot of things. It's depressing, it's sad and it's dark. It's funny, it's real and it's honest. And most of all, it's very hard to put down. Matthew McIntosh is a 26 year old son of a preacher who spent time in London and California before landing in a little suburb of Seattle called Federal Way, the setting for the book. The book follows the lives and relationships of many people who are lost, despondent, disturbed, and struggling to just get through one more day. This is a brutally frank snapshot of people that most of us of hope we never meet and pray we never become. We see them on street corners, in alleys, in parks and sometimes right next door, though we pretend to not notice and hope to God they don't notice us. McIntosh's writing style is unconventional and compelling at the same time. It is refreshingly (and shockingly) different."
4,Beautiful book but the print is fairly small & hard to read,"This book is beautiful but one of the downfalls is that theprint is quite small and light making it hard to read especially whilecooking. Also, I don't care for the separation of pictures in onehalf and the recipes in the other half. So far, the recipes I have tried we have enjoyed."
1,A Great Book to Hand to the Caterer,"This book only makes sense if you are picking out recipes to hand to a caterer you've hired, or give to the kitchen staff should you, like Martha, have one. Otherwise, most of the recipes unique to this book are completely impractical and unrealistic, particularly if you are planning on making quite a few of them to serve at a party.The photos are great to look at and offer good presentation ideas, but too many of the recipes that make the book unique rely on special equipment - deep fryers, mandolines, tartlet pans, etc. and most of the less fussy recipes are ones you no doubt have in any number of other cookbooks.If you are the type who has the time and likes to cut and stack tiny pieces of vegetables to make sushi-roll-sized terrines, or scoop out and stuff grapes with cheese and pistachio nuts, then you will absolutely love this book, but most home cooks who want to retain their sanity will do better to look elsewhere."
4,I always refer to this book for inspiration,"I cook from scratch and cook daily and thought this book was an excellent reference when planning a get together for family or friends. Many of the recipes are colorful, healthy, offer texture and are tasty. These recipes can easily be co-ordinated with any menu and many can be used as an appetizer course. This book took much time to produce with pictures and presentation ideas for every recipe. I save all of my food magazines and am lucky to get 3 -4 usable recipes. [...] This book has received way too much hype. I thought it was very basic and had very few good recipes that were new or creative."
1,Just dreadful. Buy B. Smith's cookbook,"We planned a little soiree but the canapes in this book were just dreadful. I sold this book at our local library book & bake sale for AIDS for $1.00.I switched to B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends and it was just wonderful. B. Smith is the African-American Martha and she is outstanding.I also used Essence Brings You Great Cooking by Jonell Nash and The Ebony Cookbook: A Date With a Dish by Freda De Night. I really enjoy buying these delightful cookbooks by African-American authors. Our son just loves rap music, basketball and African-American culture. Our new friends are an African-American couple and the wife was very pleased when I threw a Kwanza party."
4,Martha Stewart's Horsd'Oeuvres Handbook,"This was a present for my wife. She was extremely pleased to have this book. It was purchased at a give-away price, with a speedy delivery. What more could I ask for!!!!!"
5,A greaat book for a beginner,"I really liked this book and found it very useful. There are two sections, the first being photographs of the finised product with the page number of the recepie which is in the second section. As we would expect from martha, some are beyond the pale of a fumble fingered beginner like my self, but I have successfully made a number to great aclaim. Being able to compare what I have done to a picture of what it should be is great."
3,I wish mine came out that nicely,"If I was able to turn these ideas into the food in the pictures, I would have loved it even more. The book was nice - don't get me wrong, but I just felt like the ideas were above my skill level and rubbed it into my face instead of trying to teach me how. It is nice, though."
2,Fussy and time consuming,"Although this book is beautiful and packed with recipes, each one requires more time and careful composition than most of us have before a party. Typical Martha! I suppose if I were bringing one hors d'oeuvre to a party I could carefully put together one of these creations, but when I entertain I'm also doing the dinner and dessert and usually I put out several hors d'oeuvres. You might as well get this book from the library and peruse it for the few recipes you might make -- it certainly won't become a frequent reference unless you have a kitchen staff."
3,You better watch the Salt!,"I'm a Personal Chef/Caterer and I almost threw this book across the room. Take the measurements for the salt with a grain a salt! I cooked some stuff for an event and it was WAY too salty--this has happened on quite a few recipes from this book. Martha is renowned for not really testing the recipes! Anyway, the pictures are great, and the recipes are great--just watch the salt!"
3,Who actually makes this stuff?,"I bought this book when it made its debut on QVC. Everything looked really great during the presentation, but the book is filled with strange, exotic things most people wouldn't know where to purchase, much less eat!"
5,Learn to be a Martha,"Let's face it. You can't have a cookbook section and NOT list Martha Stewart. I know she's one of those celebrities you eitheradore or fear, but I like that mix in a chef. Besides, she knows her stuff. She's been catering for years. She know what doesand doesn't work in the kitchen. And the woman has a mission - to give us all great ideas in cooking, decorating, gardeningand organizing our junk. Here's a short selection of books you should have in your collection, including her extra-weirdHalloween book. And I highly suggest subscribing to her magazine, Martha Stewart Living, for monthly recipes and ideas. Yougo Martha. (...)"
3,Disappointing.....,"Had high hopes.....not anything much appealing or original.....*yawn*....most recipes are quite involved, and considering the results, I just don't like this one.....Not her best....."
4,DelRey Reprints Corben,"Corben. Back when names like Frazetta, Adams, Wrightson, Smith and Kirby ruled supreme aboveground. Corben was a name to be reckon with underground with his stories in SLOW DEATH and his self-published (I believe) FANTAGOR. Then Jim Warren was smart enough to let Corben strut his stuff on the black-and-white pages of CREEPY and EERIE before his HEAVY METAL breakthrough of DEN. I'm proud to say that I've been a fan of Corben since his early ""Gore"" days and I was overjoyed to discover that Del Rey was re-releasing some of Corben's collected works. I'm giving this volume only 4 Stars just because it is simply not his best work (and I'm not that certain about the level of reproduction, but I might be extrapicky) but even Corben's B-plus work is worth spending your hard-earned bread on. Can't wait until Del rey re-releases some of his Poe adaptations."
3,Pretty good if you squint a little,"There are moments of noir brilliance (ouch) in this political thriller, but these moments are counterbalanced by a plot which leaves the reader slightly incredulous. (An assassination attempt on the President of the United States by the CIA? I guess if anything is possible, then this is.)Harrington is great at depicting strong and ruthless characters who have been broken by time and liquor and bad women (try his really great Dark Ride) but the plot in the American Boys is stretched to the limit. It works, but just barely."
5,Just what I have been looking for!,"This is an excellent book..a complete guide to burning blends of oils for every imaginable emotion or cause..from blends to relax and rejuvenate, to increase work performance, creativity and help with emotional problems. There are hundreds of recipes and it is very easy to read. The presentation is just beautiful."
5,Should be required reading,"This is absolutely the best primer I have ever read on the subject of billiards. Whether you are a beginner, an intermediate or expert player there is something for all who read it and apply the principles. The text and related diagrams simplify the most difficult shots by breaking down the stroke and cue ball position before, during and after the shot. This is the book you use to drill yourself into better billiard performance. It really should be open and laying beside every practice table."
4,Very successful interweaving of two stories,"If you were to tell me of a story that focuses on a seamtress working on a medieval tapestry and an art critic of the 19th century, I would immediately question that anyone could write a story interweaving the two. Marta Morazzoni has done it with seamless ease - an incredible read.The common thread is the reading of life through their art - e.g. the seamtress is more impressed with the queen's stitches than her position. Through this comes the title - The Invention of Truth - for both artists read the truth of their lives through their art."
1,A Weak Re-Make,I didn't like the Fake Vibe of this Re-Make of Prince's Song.Prince's Version back in 1982 has so much feeling&Rawness.this Version just sucks the Life out of the Original.the Drum Programmed track is not happening.
2,WHY UPSTARTS SHOULDN'T COVER CLASSICS...,"A terribly ungroomed youngster like Alicia Keys should go back the focus on her eduaction if she's bold enough to arrogantly cover this Prince classic. Originally a strident b-side of our Royal Badness with some fine piano work, Ms. Keys turns it into a shoddy talent show-level reworking with an mechanical drum machine program and lazy paino taps. Bland and sterile, it's a suprise that diehard Purpleheads didn't try to hunt Keys down after this laughable remake. Young artists have always been known to wreck some covers of classics and this is a recent one in full exhibit. And a cocky and overpraised kiddo like Alicia should sit down and dig back into her parents' Prince records and study not reanact."
1,All Myth and Scare Tactics,"As the head of the Association Gifted Creative Children listed in the massive Encyclopedia Of Associations, I have spoken out in favor of both TSR and the D&D games. Gifted children get alot out of this game and people like the author <sic> also believe the Smurfs are a tool of their Devil. I have dealt with thousands of families with gifted Children and have worked/spoken with the CDC, Albert Einstein School of Medicines top teen suicide experts and trust me this woman is going on heresay, preconcieved thinking and lord knows what other ""bear false witness"" nonsense."
1,Ever think just why people don't like the game?,"Its because of those crazy occultists that start to play the game, far after they've lost it themselves. Anyone with their head on straight is perfectly fit to play this game and have a good time without killing people in strange rituals. The game is only as evil as the players who play it, and then only for those players."
1,Christian Role Player Review!,"As a Christian and as a role-player, I must say I was -extremely- disappointed by this book. The author obvoiusly has no clue about the -real- content of the book(s) and is just repeating comments about the game they heard as sheer rumor. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Not recommended - even as bird cage liner."
1,More lies and slander about Dungeons and Dragons,"This book is just another good example of one more thing the world does not need: A bigoted, small-minded, hypocritical, self-serving hatemonger who can lie and attempt to frighten simple-minded people with impunity. Rather than bother with unessential things like research, the author merrily twists the facts to show that D&D is an occult menace preying on the minds of our children. It's too bad that the book is so badly written and one-sided that even the most hardcore bigot would have trouble believing it. Poorly written and laughably ludicrous, The Truth about Dungeons and Dragons is useful only in that you will get many laughs out of it. The truth may be out there, but it is definitely not in this book. If this is best argument against Dungeons and Dragons that anyone can come up with, then I guess fans of the game need never fear that it will be banned"
1,A housewife with too much free time,"For 2 years I have played D&D and every time I type those keywords into the google browser I always get ""D&D: A dangerous cult"" and ""Should your child be playing Dungeons and Dragons?"". I even doubt the person who wrote this book actually played, or even watched a game. They say it promotes homosexuality, You could look through every single book and not find that word, the only time they ever say ""Sex"" is when referring to male and female. They say it promotes satan worshipping, the word ""Satan"" is not in those books, there are gods plural, but anyone smart enough to understand D&D should probably know the difference from whats real and whats not. This lady is trying to kill every childhood joy with the books she writing: GI Joe,Nintendo,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Everything."
1,insulting!,I found this book insulting and absolutely false.As many of the other reviews have said anyone who plays this game and ends up murdering someone was already screwed up before they began playing the game. No one who i play with would ever think of doing one of the devil-worshipping acts. We are all very normal too we have all played sports on a team and we are all very smart. I think we can throw this book in the garbage along with the book about how seeing naked tutrtles leads to devil-worshipping
1,This book is a total lie. AD&D players should not get it.,Anyone who has read even the players handbook knows that this book is a total lie.This person has not read any of the books about D&D or AD&D.Any person who even likes D&D a little should not get this book.
1,Absolutely Ridiculous!!!,This woman obviously has absolutely no clue what she is talking about. Don't even waste your money on this totally worthless waste of paper
1,iDIOT with no life,First of all ADND is a great game in wich strategy and imagination is used.But idiots like joan just cant get it through there thick heads.They need to exploit ADND and give it a rotten rep.Yea well they do that because they dont have anything to do in life.Joan get a job at Taco Bell or something........
1,Spreading an Urban Myth,I was amazed at how a publisher would allow such a book to make it's way to the market. I would like to know where Joan Hake Robie got her resources for this work. It seems to just recycle early myths about the game that have since been proven false. In my opion it is a way to sale books to overly worried parents.
1,"The Truth About ""The Truth About Dungeons and Dragons""","Don't waste your time. This is the work of hatemongers and fundamentalists. The ""facts"" presented withing this work of ""literature"", and I use that term loosely, are biased and not at all trustworthy. This is a clear case of Christian propaganda and smear tactics. This book is not at all a decent work or investigative literature but instead one mindless accusation after another by a woman who obviously had no idea what she was talking (writing) about. The ""examples"" of game mechanics given within are one-dimensional and tainted by the author so that words which in the game are supposed to mean one thing mean another to the reader. This is not a well researched work of fact but instead a totally biased and searing attack on TSR and all role playing games. The ludicrous nature of this book is good only for comic relief"
1,Disinformation,"AD&D is an interesting game. Further, it is what you make it. The author's book is at best poorly researched. Does that mean that a parent should automatically allow their child to play? Not necessarily. But reading this tripe won't help you make an informed decision about whether or not your child is mature enough to play."
1,"Haven't read the book, but have read the reviews...","Just like all other games, AD&D (and Magic the Gathering, which I'm sure has been persecuted also), is just that - A GAME. I've played AD&D since 1988 and MTG since 1994 and am far from considering Satanism or Witchcraft as a hobby and/or religious choice. I am a perfectly normal, Christian, intelligent, and sane human being. If someone has mental problems that may surface while playing, then don't play - For us ""sane"" people: play on - it is only a game."
1,The Rantings of a Parinoid Mother,"Dungeons & Dragons is a role-playing game created in the early sixties by a group of college students who decided they wanted to have a passtime over their summer. It has in no way EVER been linked to a satanic cult or been played by druids. If you were to ask a druid about it he would probably respond, ""What the #$%^ is Dungeons @ Dragons?"" This book is a collection of misguided statments, personal speculations listed as facts, and fabricated stories. I was laughing so hard that my sides ached for hours. If you are looking for a book that has no basis in reality, this book is for you."
1,Surprise! Surprise!,"a quick check of Dame Robie's other works will tell you all you need to know. She is a right wing Christ fanatic who wants to demonize everything that promote individual thought or creativity . Titles such as ""Terror in the Toybox""? gimme a break, with the exception of Hollywood Special Effects, when was the last time there was something to be be truly terrified of in a child's toybox (unless they have a doll cruelly pinned to a pair of perpedicular popscicle sticks). I doubt she has actually played the game (She also has a book ""exposing"" the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), in fact I doubt she has ever read anything except for carefully precribed devotional passages from a giddeon's bible she lifted from a Motel 6."
1,unbelievable,"I made an account here just to write this...i find it absolutly unbelievable that anyone could think like this. Im fourteen years old, play the game fairly often...and am completly normal! The only thing Dungeons & Dragons has done for me is allowed me to find new friends (many in fact), provide hours of fun, broaden my imagination, and create a great hobby, not to mention many other benefits. The only negative here may be the money! i have to save up for each book! :) But i love it and thats what matters. So i feel anyone who takes the time and energy to actually express that this game is satanic, bad for the youth, etc. is completly and utterly wrong and making a big mistake!"
1,"She's consistent, if nothing else.","Go click on her name under the title (above) and look at the other, equally inflammatory texts which she has seen fit to release upon the world. If you want to hear noxious spew recited by hypocrites, just turn on CSPAN and save yourself the money."
1,Jesse Folks is the Target Audience,"All I can say is if you take to heart anything that Jesse Folks says, you are the target audience: ignorant, ill-informed, and a product of a cult enviroment that has nothing better to do than criticize that which you do not understand. After hearing the so called book, all I can say is that as a USAF Major, CUma Sum Laud college graduate and a father and husband in a WONDERFUL family, I must be the blood thirsty, slavering demon worshiper in my sleep!"
1,Robie is insane!,This author needs to be stopped. And we should pray for all of those that have such weak will sand minds as to believe joan's insanity. She could be one of the false profit$.
1,Trash......,"Hmm.... never actually read this book, but from reading enough of the reviews, it sounds like it's only good for laughs."
1,oh man...,"oh man... how is this not in fiction?i have a good friend who is gay. he has been so long before he played dnd. yet according to miss joan, dnd is the cause, and it is a horrible thing. and dnd is why i have a failure of a life. oh yes. my horrible, failed life of good grades and being a sociable person with a job whom people like and goes to church and believes in God. yeah. right. get a life. but seriously, this is the funniest book ever. get it used, though. as little as possible should be done to get her excited and thinking she has a viable point. DON'T ENCOURAGE HER! PLEASE!"
1,disgusting,"What else could you expect from a self-righteous, holier-than-thou, wannabe T.V. evangelist? Is bunk, and I laugh at the very notion that any level of course study, let alone a top level grad course would use this waste of paper as anything more than a quick laugh."
1,Has this woman even played this game?,"How many stars would I give this book? None, zero, ziltch, nada. But I have to at least give the minimum of one although I'd actually rather give it a negative score. I've been playing AD&D for about 4 years now, I go to university, and live my life like a normal person. I also know dozens of other perfectly normal people, friends, and even one of my schools' professors who've played AD&D even longer than I have. I probably would have never gotten into university if it wasn't for AD&D. That game has helped me with my imagination, my writing skills, group thinking, history and socializing."
1,NO STARS,"Since you can't award any book title a no star rating I have to make note of it in this review. This book of all things considered is one of the worst pieces of pesuasive writing I've ever seen. It's boring, annoying, repetative, and screams of amateurism.There are no redeeming qualities to this book. It is composed entirely of outdated information, half-truths, crippled logic, out-of-context quotations, pithy phrases, nitpicking, and every bad technique of argumentation known to man.You want the REAL truth about D&D;? Updated information which debunks this entire book? Check out the sites...."
3,DMH and Satanism,"While I will admit this book has some pretty major flaws, I have also worked in the field of mental health and can attest that there is a direct corrolation between involvement in the occult (i.e. Satanism ) and D&D. I was shocked to find this, having played AD&D when I was young, because this information came from a non-Christian source (a thirteen year veteran case worker with the Dept. of Mental Health). She is convinced that the information in this book is pretty accurate due to her experience with some truly disturbed people. Not that I endorse this book in it's entirety, but it I wouldn't reject it as flipantly as some of the other reviewers have. Peace out!"
1,Didn't want to waste the money,"I browsed the book at the store, and decided NOT to spend the money...I have no clue where this lady is from...I began playing D&D; in 1978, I graduated top of my high school class, became a US Marine, a Police Officer and now own a multi-million dollar consulting business (and no college degree).I am sure D&D; added to my current failure of a life...I would say the author is obviously a failure at writing & research.D&D; is no different than playing Cowboys & Indians, Barabie Dolls or anything else that takes an imagination... like playing at being a writer !"
1,If you like those exploitation films...,"This is the coolest exploitation book since that 1960's classic ""How good girls date"". I sell D @ D games all day long...look me under advanced member search in the auctions listing for Faethe. I run a necromancer/psionicist in my games..gee..and I am getting a master's degree in art ed. My whole life has failed! HOWEVER - it is important for books like this to be on this server..because it lets you know that people like this who promote fear and hatred are really out there..and that my friends is reality."
1,hhmmmmm,I am a christain and i find AD&D to be a very fun passtime. It helps increase my creativity and writing skills. I do not see how someone who has probably never even read a rule book or gave the game a try could say it is bad. The bibliography is a sign that she is (I say this with respect) ignorant of the fact. She never studied the subject she just wrote on it.
2,A rehash of the superior first run,"Take the rehash last few six or so episodes of the original and throw in some new lifeless characters, stir well and you have Heroic Knight. The new characters are never really delved into in the same way you felt about the original characters - in fact, even the appearance of the original characters is glossed over and reduced to throw-away lines.Not to say the new characters could not have held up the movie, but they are never really given the muscle to come out from the shadow of the original. In fact, by the time we get to the end I was hoping for the heroes to fail so that we could cut their numbers in half and pray that those who survived wouldn't sit around whinning about how terrible things are and how much they will rise to the challenge. In fact the entire last half of the series sounds like the one-liners from motivational posters."
4,Read the incuded booklet thingie,"People complain about the repeats in the story line and such, it seems as if they didn't take the time to read the booklet that was in the first disc. It explains that much of this series *is* just a rehash of the OVA because the OVA was an incomplete adaptation of the novels, the animators decided to do a more complete and accurate retelling of the novels. The things in this series that negate the previous series are suposed to be taken as true, what you saw before didn't happen. Just pretend it was something you heard 2nd hand from an unreliable source.I find it different enough to remain intersting, the animation is great, as is the music (the opening sequence is fantastic on both aspects).At the end of every episode you get a super-deformed short called ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"". I find it hilarious in an ""Oh my god that is so stupid"" kind of way. Those episodes alone are almost worth buying the video for."
1,Poor quality anime,"I got into anime a few years ago and compared to some of the other anime I've seen this is very poor in quality. I only managed to watch the first few episodes and could not get myself to watch anymore. Based on what I did see, the animation was subpar - which would've been fine if there was an engaging storyline. Unfortunately, it lacked character development and a good plot. Other than using the same types of characters (elves, dwarves, etc.) as Lord of the Rings series, there is not much comparison in quality."
3,Ok but not as good as the first series,"Ok, this review is directed at fans who have seen the first lodoss war series. This new series has many audio visual improvements(less repeating music, better animation) but frankly the story doesn't make any sense. The second series story changes some things that happened in the first series and completely ignores some other stuff. There is even a point where they show a flashback to the first series but changed on of the people involved in the scene. Also, the last 20 episodes are exactly like the 1st series just with new characters....I found myself saying,"" I've seen this before"" very often. For people who didn't see the 1st series...you will probably love this but for anyone who was expecting to see a continuation of the 1st series, this series is more of a rewriting of the first series."
5,A Journey into a Particularly American Life,"Uphill With Archie is a beautiful read, and an important one. Archibald MacLeish was a singular man, one who played a large role in his age of American History, as poet, statesman, and influential thinker. Reading Uphill, one is brought back into an age which is directly relevant to our own, and so the book succeeds as a fascinating document in American History. It also succeeds wonderfully as the story of a son (the author) growing up in the presence of a man larger than life, who had friends like Louis Frankfurter and Clark Clifford, whose personality burned so bright that others nearby seemed either illumined by it, or merely silhouetted. It is a powerful tale of one man's growing older, and one man's growing up.William MacLeish is a fluent and graceful writer, and this book was a fine companion for several day's reading."
4,Why not call it Choro Q?,A bit choppy but nice.A cross between cars and pokemon.I highly recomend the PS2 game Road Trip and hope theirsmart enough to try a GBA version!Road trip is like the GB Pokemon games only with car raceing.
2,"Too much sex, but not sexy enough","there is a lot of sex in the book. obviously the writer wants to sell ""oriental"" sex. but paradoxically, the sex scenes are not sexy enough. often they even make me yawn. maybe this book needs more psychological depth to become more sexy? anyway, i hope the writers at large can know that they cannot depend on sex sepectacles only."
1,superficial......,"This book is superficial. Trying to make out much from little. Yet how can one milk a thin book that much? Also, iUniverse is really having something wrong with bounding. The books from it are not solid enough."
1,quality,"i am not talking about the quality of the contents of the book. i am talking about the book as a book. in terms of art design, printing, and BINDING, this book is terrible. i dont know why this publishing house is so under-qualified. the BINDING of the book is especially awful. the pages fall off so easily."
2,"It looks good, but alarm doesn't work.","The power reserve indicator keeps pointing the lowest position and the top pusher cannot set the alarm to on or off postion. I don't know if it is because the battery is dying so that the alarm won't work. But a new watch comes with a dying battery? I sent two emails to customer service a few days ago but nobody answered me.Anyway, I have to return it.*Edit on Sep-9*I got a reply from customer service which said the battery is probably dying. When I received the watch it was running. But the other watches I bought was always turned off when I received it."
3,Almost good...,"For the first few months I had this controller, I thought it was great. Great range, battery life, and general feel. Though as others have said, the one bad part is that you have to hit the buttons a little harder than should be necessary. Another bad part about this, constantly hitting the A button that hard has started wearing out the plastic part between the button and the circuit board, eventually causing the button to stick. I've opened it up and fixed it once, but there's no telling how long it will be before the hole gets bigger and is unrepairable. I'm just hoping that Logitec will send me one or two of these pieces in the mail."
1,"If you use the ""a, b, x or y"" buttons this contorller stinks","I just purchased two of these controllers and unfortunately the games I play use the ""a,b,x,y"" buttons quite frequently. Unless you really press the buttons down hard, the functionality of the button won't work. When you push the button with normal pressure, the green light goes on in the part you plug directly into the XBox, so it is not a wireless issue, but again, no functionality. Both controllers have same problem.At Logitech Support website, I noticed in their forum section that there are quite a few people who have complained about this problem so I don't think I just received two bad controllers."
2,It's just not that good,"I expected a quality product from Logitech, instead I got a controller that is impossible to use for games. The buttons and d-pad either don't register or register multiple clicks, SUPER ANNOYING"
5,Excellent quality...,"This is by far the best XBox controller I have ever used. If you notice, the 360 uses almost the exact design as this controller (Note that Logitech designed the controller for the 360). That shows that even Microsoft recognized the excellent design here.I noticed that some people said they had problems with button response. I wouldn't know about this. I have four of these controllers and I've never had this issue. I would just tell them to return those controllers and get different ones."
1,always losing connection,"I would say I just got one bad controller, but I have two of them and they both lose connection all the time. The controller feels great and works great, but I constantly lose the wireless connection- which is obviously VERY frustrating. It is additionally frustrating since I paid $40 each. I thought I would get quality for me money. Of course, they worked well until the 1 year warranty ran out :( I also try pulling the batteries out when I'm not using them- doesn't help. I also called Logitec and they said to pull out batteries, hit Start and the left trigger as you replace batteries and you should regain the connection. That doesn't even work anymore.Intec makes good controllers and they are guaranteed for LIFE."
5,"Well-made, a little too light","I purchased this Controller to improve my convenience when using with XBMC and Playing Game. So far it has proved to do its purpose. Sometimes you need to press one of the buttons to ""wake it up"" when it's in sleep mode. Besides that, it is a very well-made product with a perfect design and long lasting battery life."
2,"difficult aiming (halo, etc), un-responsive buttons, poor ergonomics","A, B, X & Y buttons do NOT respond well.you push the buttons and they easily bottom out, but do not register. After they bottom out, if you press a little harder, then they register. this is not a quality defect, its the intended design, obviously not designed by a gamer.Aiming is difficult with the thumbstick when playing FPS games. The sticks resistence should be light, when the stick is near the center. The resistence should then increase, as you push it away from the center (it does the exact opposite).It does fit your hand as well as the s-controller.The triggers are poorly positioned and the springs are too stiff.GOOD NEWSthe wireless feature works great! just dont play games withit."
1,Total piece of garbage,"Took three weeks to finally receive this thing. When it arrived it took about three tries to finally get started. Then once you tried to play a game, the joystick only moved in the down direction. If you try to order one of these controllers, you better be careful where you get it from. Needless to say I will be returning mine."
4,DeWalt DW9057 Batteries,"The Dewalt batteries we ordered came in when stated they would and are a perfect fit for the drill. They were exactly what was needed and readily available and I will use Amazon.com again for other purchases.Thanks,"
2,DEWALT BATTERY,I am dissappointed in the relatively short life of this rechargeable battery. I'm hoping the one I just purchased will last longer.
4,Works as advertised,"The old batteries for my DeWalt power screw driver died after many years, and this one replaced...well, one of them. It works as advertised, although a bit steep in price."
4,It works!,The screwdriver works like new again.The lifespan of my Dewalt tools has not been long enough and batteries are too costly. I have bought my last yellow tool.
5,Just what was needed.,"We had a very hard time finding this battery in any store, even the battery specialty stores. The price here seemed reasonable and so far, works perfectly.So glad we found it, the tool would have been useless without a battery."
1,Be careful! It may not be what you think.,"This item is only an index, mostly of names, of the two volumes the author put together concerning her ancestor, James Bourland. He was involved in the Gainesville area of texas before, during and after the Civil War. Having read ""Tainted Breeze"" written by McCaslin, which concerns the same area and time period and details the lynching of some 41 American citizens in the town of Gainesville, texas during October 1862, these volumes of ""Bourland"" appear to me to be an attempted whitewash of Bourland and his cronies. I sincerely hope that said Bourland and his associates live in infamy for the heinous crimes they committed, and were allowed to get away with by the State of texas during, and for years after, the Civil War."
5,Awesome!!! Must hear this!!!,"This is one of the best albums out there - bar none. Whether you normally like this style of music or not, you must hear this! Phenomenal music, lyrics, vocals -- it has it all! Dave Gleason is THE man!"
4,Country Rock Keeps Rolling,"Remember ""country rock""? This album defines it, or should I say redefines it. I am a bit tardy reviewing this album but,I just heard it for the first time a week ago. I haven't heard edgy, distinctive, country sounds like this since I got turned on to Son Volt several years ago. Mr Gleason and friends might not get an invitation to join The Eagles at The Hotel California but, they would have one heckuva hoedown with Pure Prarie League, Gram Parsons and The Flying Burritto Bros., The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Dwight Yoakum, Emmy Lou and the rest. Don't waste another day, seek, find, and buy this CD"
4,what do you want? the best of bread?...,off key vocals....generic honky-tonk? i'm sorry to hear that.what do you got that's on key and not so generic? i don't think it's so bad.....
3,Too bad they aren't an all insturmental band,Dave Gleason's Wasted Days offer somewhat generic country rock with nods to honky tonk. It's not all bad. Unfortunately Mr. Gleason's off key vocals tend to make this a difficult release to listen to.
3,Good background material but poor transcriptions,"I absolutely revere Buddy Holly. this book, however, fell short. I was a little disappointed with the tablatures. The songs are not transcribed in keys Holly used. If this was done to make the songs easier to play, a retranscription might be understandable. However, fairly simple songs are actually made somewhat difficult. An example is Peggy Sue. The song consists of a total of four chords in the key of E. Here, it is in the key of G and somehow there are five chords including two 7ths. Peggy Sue, as played by Holly has no 7ths. Not Fade Away is also a bit convoluted and transcribed in a more difficult key of E flat rather than the original (and easier to play) key of E. I was hoping to learn some other Holly songs but I can only pick out a couple from this book since the transcription is so convoluted. Having said all this, I enjoyed the photos and background material."
2,Scores are missing sections - a summary at best,I purchased this book hoping for transcriptions of my favorite Buddy Holly songs. I was very disappointed. Many sections of the songs are missing. Most songs only have about 60% of the song.
2,Turgid,"Having come across many references to Shotter in the writing of Harlene Anderson and others, I bought this book to expand my knowledge of social constructionism and to develop my theoretical understanding of postmodern and dialogical approaches to therapy. Unfortunately I have not found it helpful: with its fantastically complex sentence structures it is very difficult to read. This makes me wonder if (a) I am not sufficiently intelligent, or (b) it is no fact not very well written. There have been sentences I have grappled with for minutes on end, only to come to the conclusion that the sentence is incomprehensible because it is essentially ungrammatical. Perhaps some po-mo game is being played here, I don't know."
4,Yves Saint Laurent Women's Sunglasses,"The sunglasses are beautiful, however they are quite big. I'm beginning to wonder if there was some sort of size selection that I missed. They are unusually wide for sunglasses and barely fit on my ears, and I would like to think I have a normal size head. Everything else about them is great! So, if you have a normal to small head I wouldn't suggest them. Although, if maybe you have a larger than normal head these would work fantastically!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"I love Etta James. I love Etta James singing live at a club and in the studio. Unfortunately, this CD does the great lady a huge disservice. This CD is essentially the same CD (with songs retitled and order rearranged) as the lamentable ""Red Hot and Live"" CD. There is one extra track, though: the Jimmy Reed song ""Baby What Do You Want Me to Do"" (there is no indication that this song was part of the same set as the rest of the CD).Here's the problem: Etta is in great form --- but each of her songs is faded out in the middle of the song! You are robbed of hearing her final build, not to mention the complete presentation and playing of her fine band.This lame, stunted presentation keeps getting repackaged. It's also the first of the two live sets on disc three of ""Etta James - Live and In the Studio"".This CD is worth its $1.66 price on Amazon --- but don't pay a penny more. I assume the other reviews (the raves) are from people selling or trying to get rid of their own copies of the CD."
5,Riveting Drama,"My Dad, Gerry Green, wrote the screenplay for ""Wallenberg: A hero's story"". It's a powerfully written drama which accurately depicts how Raoul Wallenberg saved thousands of Jews from the death camps. I would reccomend this DVD for the historical significance in teaching students about the Holocaust."
4,WALLENBERG STORY,"I had been interested in the Wallenberg story for some time now, however I didnt realize it comes in two separate parts. It is well made and I recommend it !"
4,A brave man facing hell,Wallenberg was a diplomat that provided fake papers (at great peril to himself) to people desperate to escape from Nazi death camps. He survived the Nazis only to disappear behind the Iron Curtain as the USSR over-ran Eastern Europe. Poor Wallenburg...Nasty Russians!
5,Brutal!,A must see. As far as I am concerned he is saint WALLENBERG! This is a very emotional and sad story.
3,Wallenberg: A Hero's Story,I am very pleased that they released this long over duefilm! Only one complaint I have is that it is not the wholemovie; 187 minutes. I am glad I taped in SP mode and transferredto DVD when the film was on the old 'True TV' network in 2 partswhich added up to 202 minutes. Sometimes I don't understand whystudios can't release an entire film!.Mike
4,A great introduction of the German empire,"This is the clearest and most concise introduction of the German Empire prior to WWI that I have read. Despite the short length of the book, Sturmer was able to provide a rather comprehensive overview of the German empire. I was impressed by the fact that the author was able to cover so many aspects (the German economy, military and politics) with so little words. As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is highly recommended for people who are interested in having a better knowledge of Germany prior to the Great War."
4,Good short history,"As the title suggests, it is a short history but the author manages to get alot of information into the book. It whets your appetit to read more about German history between 1870-1914 which was a critical period for this country and for Europe. The writer's style is clear and he is easy to read. After I finished this book I ordered a more comprehensive history of Germany."
5,book review,book arrived promptly as promised and was well packaged. excellent condition! a thoroughly satisfactory transaction. my thanks to the vendor and five stars!!!
5,Stunning tribute,"A visual gem; this book is one that even those with just a passing interest in space history would enjoy. In addition to the numerous photos, the text is extremely cogent and well written. It covers all major aspects of the apollo program in a highly informative and entertaining manner. The book is of a very high quality and will not disappoint."
4,Excellent for the general public,"For those of us who don't know the difference between an AS-501 and an AS-504 this really is an 'Epic Journey'.It may have it's minor imperfections (most are minor such as 33' vs. 36') but this is not highly uncharacteristic in books intended for the general public (you'll notice this often if you're superspecialized in a subject).And for those of us trying to be perfect, Armstrong never admitted to not saying ""a"" in his famous quote. He says he thinks he said it and that it could have been lost in transmission. This however, seems unlikely due to the flow of the transmission. He also asked that it at least be put in brackets when quoted to read:""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.""And this book really illustrates that."
3,"Yes, lots of errors...","As mentioned in the other review, there are many errors in this book...But overall it is a good read.An example, the Grissom Apollo 1 quote about not being able to communicate between the ship and the control center is not even close to being correct...Otherwise, lots of great pictures here, but if you want the actual, true story, look elsewhere..."
5,On the Bill Moyers segment,"Bill Moyers talks to Charlie Rose about his new ten - part series on 'Genesis'. Moyers attended a seminar conducted by Barton Wissotsky on Genesis and was fascinated by the idea of an open discussion of the Biblical text in which its moral significance for people today is central. He assembled an all- star cast of commentators from the whole spectrum of the world's religions and also from various positions in regard to religious faith. The series is in ten parts centering on major stories such as Cain and Abel, the call of Abraham, Joseph and his brothers. Moyers is a person of great seriousness and intelligence and he speaks with conviction about the way these discussions can speak to our quest for meaning in our lives today."
2,Really poor quality.,"I bought this line driver for my high end car audio system thinking that line drivers are fairly simple electronics and that a cheap model wouldn't really affect anything. Boy was I wrong.This line driver destroys sound quality. In a poor audio system, it may not be noticeable, but it really chops off a the extreme highs and deep bass. It makes the whole system sound really constrained.It also appears to internally use a cheap switching regulator for power and as such brings in quite a bit of interference.It does however effectively boost volume to newer, higher levels without distortion."
5,Great!,"This Warner Archive DVD edition is great fun. The picture appears to be Widescreen in this transfer, and I enjoyed seeing this rare horror film on DVD format. It would have been nice to see a couple of extras (maybe a classic, if short, ""making of"" featurette, and a theatrical trailer) but I am just glad that it has finally arrived on DVD. I had no problems with my particular copy. However, be forewarned that the print itself appears to be from an old VHS tape copy (no remastering to this viewer's eyes has been done), and that the sound is quite sub-par. However, if you enjoy slowly paced suspense movies, you'll like this one too, regardless of the quality of sound or FX (this one is from the days when we didn't really need as much of such things)."
4,CLASSIC!!!,I had this in vhs and it was stolen-now i have FOUND it-the movie is a little slow in progression-but all the classics are slow in comparison to the action movies nowadays-i REALLY love this movie-the tape is in great condition-the sound is better than the dvd's of action we have now-you have to turn them up to hear the voices-I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE IN VHS!
2,Wore out FAST,"This Everlast bag is pretty, and is a small but reasonable size. Within a few months (of not even using it every day), it had holes in it. I sewed them up, and it just got more and bigger holes in different places. Unless you're not going to carry anything over a pound, don't get this bag."
4,GREAT BOOK!,Purchased this book for my newly kindergarten student :) I thought it would be a good book to ease any fears and share a book adventure. She loved it. The story was funny.
5,Adorable,"My 5-year-old daughter started Kindergarten last month. She loves this book (and so do I). It's fun to read, and helps with the review of letters of alphabet at the same time. The pictures capture everyone's attention (kudos to the illustrator). Miss Bindergarten's classroom looks very much like my daughter's, too :-)"
2,disappointing,"Unfortunately I ordered this before the other DVD with Popp, Randova, Pso and Altrichter (from Product Details) or Popp, Randova, Protschka and Mikules (from the cover) was released. Would that I had waited another week or two,This is a recording from 1988 and its age shows with less than stellar audio and frequent camera cuts. Josef Protschka is the best of the soloists. Gabriella Benackova seems to be having an off night. The other two soloists were undistinguished, to be as charitable as I can. The chorus and orchestra might have sounded better if the DVD had been remastered.I am sure that the new release will be much better. I would hate to think that it could be worse."
5,"""Action"", not acting","I am a firm believer that there is no one ""right"" way to be an actor. However, I *do* think that actors should expose themselves to many different schools of thought and find what works for them. So whether you are a Meisnerian, a Stanislavski-ite, or a Hagenist, you owe it to yourself to read this. It is what I would call ""de-constructionist"" acting technique -- breaking things down to their essential elements of action and intent. I was never able to get my mind around some of the more esoteric elements of other acting methods, but this one made sense to me. You may also want to read ""True and False"" by David Mamet, as it provides some of the philosophical underpinnings for this approach to acting."
4,Another Acting Triumph,"If you've read True and False by David Mamet, this book is a great one to read right after. It explains the finer points of 'acting-style.' No matter what you read, as an actor, there are always questions about 'script analysis' and character development. This book almost answers any questions you could have, not by just explaining the answers, but guiding you so that eventually you can easily find the answers yourself."
5,Extremely Helpful,Straightforward and incredibly easy to understand (without being obnoxiously simplistic). I would recommend this to all actors as another viewpoint.
5,Even if you're not an actor,"I'm a theatre major, but I'm not an actor. I've never been, actually. But one of the requirements is to take an acting course, which put me in a pinch.We study this book in class, and this book is great, even for people who know nothing about acting. It really does do a good job for making it easy to understand."
4,Buy with Warranty,"If this DVD Player had not malfunctioned 30 days after use, it would get a 5 star rating. I recommend purchasing the replacement warranty from Target or Amazon for those ""just in case"" worries. Twist screens are the way to go so it can be angled just right. It also folds flat to hang on the back of the front seat! The sound in this DVD Player is loud and clear. The battery will charge in 5 hours and will play for 3 - 4 hours. There is a slight ""motor running"" sound but it isn't distracting for most. This player is great to hook up to your T.V. when you need a DVD player or to view pictures on a CD. The Problem: While watching a movie, it turned to a blue screen. I turned it off, then on, but still a blue screen. I tried the battery instead of the power cord; No go. ""They"" said it was a manufacturers defect and using my warranty, I get a full refund including shipping cost. Now, I'll get a different brand, ""just in case"". I like things to work for longer than 30 days or 26 movies."
5,Wonderful Bing,"This is a great album. As always, Bing's voice and phrasing is unparalleled. This album includes songs not found on compilation-CD's of Bing's work. I like the orchestrations because they are really jazzy and upbeat. However, I think they also detract a little from the album because they interfere with the intimacy that I usually get from a Bing Crosby performance. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this album."
4,Just One Regret,"Gosh, this is a good record, made in response to Sinatra's powerful ascendance. Other reviewers here do it good justice.In contrast to the workaholic perfectionism of Mr. Sinatra, too many other performers of incredible raw talent sought an alternate path. I'm thinking of Fred MacMurray, Dean Martin, Jackie Gleason and, yes, Bing Crosby. The liner notes here describe how Bing only devoted a couple of mornings effort to the recording so he could hit the links after lunch. That the results are so good speaks to his powers. But one wonders the summits he could have reached had he poured his heart and soul into his craft. For contrast, check out the Steppin' Out sessions that Astaire did with Oscar Peterson. No lack of commitment there.Thus one star deducted. (I guess this review is kind of like going to heaven and complaining about the harp music.)"
1,Kevin Trudeau is a Convicted Felon,"This book is one big ploy to get unsuspecting readers to purchase website and newsletter subscriptions from Trudeau!""Author"" Kevin Trudeau was convicted for credit card fraud and spent 3 years in a federal penetenary.Beware Consumers: He obtained the card numbers from one of his snake oil infomericals!"
5,This is far more than a book about boxing.,"I was greatly surprised and pleased by what an engaging and interesting book this is. Mills Lane is not just a boxing referee, but a judge in Nevada and a former professional boxer. He is also one of the most outspoken, to-the-point people I've encountered in print or real life in some time. He talks not only about major fights he's officiated, but also about his philosophy, his time in the Marine Corps, his view of being a judge, boxing generally, and his own boxing experiences. This is also something of a ""personal motivation/inspiration"" book. This is boxing through the eyes of a very insightful, interesting man."
1,Don't bother,"There's a good reason why Amana doesn't make a stainless blade. I figure this would have cost about $3.75 per cut except for Amazon's great guarantee. They were pretty nice cuts, but only until the blade blew up."
2,Not Great,"I was very much awaiting this dvd, but much to my surprise after i begin viewing I lost interest very fast. Story was not what i thought would be in this dvd. Only reason i gave it 2 stars is of the actor Richard Harris......"
5,Movie,This is a great movie! It gives a great story of John's last days on earth. Really good description of the book of Revelations.
3,"An average film, at best","I watched this movie for two reasons: First: I loved Harris in the film `Abraham.' Harris is truly a great actor. Second: I checked out the reviews and all but one said this was a `great' movie. True to form, Harris does a very fine job, however, it doesn't make up for the lousy subplots. This film in no way compares to the TNT Bible Collection (Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David & Samson & Delilah), nor the other Bible films (Esther, Jeremiah, & Solomon). There isn't a bad film in the bunch.I wanted so much for this film to be great, but it is only average. It is worth watching once & that is about it."
3,Close,"The idea of doing a movie based on the book of Revelation is a good one, but not an easy task.I respect the efforts put out in this particular production, but too much effort was put into the 'side' stories. The book of Revelation is dynamic enough to stand alone. Why did we need a side story about the love affair between two characters that were never mentioned in the Bible?The actual visions of John that were acted out were quite good, but I think more could have been put into it.I recommend this as a 'primer' of sorts on Revelations, but if you're already familiar with the book, this will frustrate you more than help you."
5,Existential Redneck,"Really an amazing book. To create such a character and such a ""voice"" AND have him delve into a real literary plot--this is the mark of a true writer. It may offend some, but it should delight most. Chester is one of the most original characters ever to appear on the page, and the tale of his reconnection to humanity and community is priceless. A great start for a career of writing!"
3,energy consuming,"this is a nice camera. But it is too energy-consuming. With the 2 AA batteries in the package, I shot only 2 pictures and played with some functions,say,replay,delete,setup.I don't know why it is like this.In other words, if you want to shoot 10 pictures,you gotta have at least 6 AA batteries!!! suggestion: buy an AC adapter,and batt charger."
5,Good Stuff,This camera works great!!!! I love the picture quality and all the things you can do with this camera. I still use the memory card that came with my camera because it can hold up to 32 pictures. I purchased some Sony rechargeable batteries and charger so battery life is not a problem. All in all its a good buy!
5,Great Digital Camera For Beginner!!!,"This Canon PowerShot A300 3.2MP digital camera is great! For about $109 it is a bargain with 64MB of CF card. There may be no optical zoom lens but the digital zoom of 5.1x does a pretty good job. It may look de-pixilated at the zoom of 5.1x but when the pictures come out it is better looking with a bit blurry. There is a micro feature too that allow you to take picture of small stuff as close as 2 inch away.Overall, I have it for about two weeks and I am pretty happy with it."
2,Takes forever to 'record' a picture,"Takes absolutely forever to 'record' a picture. You click the 'shutter' button and then the thing just sits there for an interminably long period of time. Add to that the pitiful battery life managed out of the 2 AA's that will fit into this camera and you've got a product that really has reached the end of its useful life.A couple years ago it would have been a fine camera, in 2004 its a dinosaur. I, stupidly, bought it last year thinking it would be comparable to some of the other higher-end Canon cameras on the market. I was sorely mistaken and deeply regret the purchase. Don't make my mistake, this isn't a significant improvement over a 98 Sony Mavica in anything except being able to use a flash card in lieu of a floppy disk."
2,Buy stock in a battery company first,"I got this camera a couple of months ago and I'm not real please with it. Althought it takes good pictures it eats up batteries even when your not using it. If I let it sit for a week the first thing I need to do is change batteries to get it working. I also have a problem importing pictures directly from the camera to my graphics program, it will only allow for one picture at a time to be imported, this is the first camera that has done this to me. So I'm pretty disappointed with the camera, expecially since it was a Canon."
2,Nothing past 20 feet,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this camera, but I've been disappointed with two aspects of it. Even with a higher resolution setting, I couldn't get sharp pictures indoors from more than 20 feet away. I've also found the controls slower and more complicated than most other digitals I've owned. I wish I had put this money towards a higher-quality camera (which I ended up doing anyway)."
2,just OK,"Have owned this camera for a few years. Never happy with image quality. Battery life is sucked dry very rapidly. Much better cameras out there I'm sure, even back then..."
1,Don't buy it!,"I'm still wondering how could Canon create such a bad product. I was stupid enough for not read customer reviews before buying it.The A300 will eat a pair of batteries (even those with more than 2000 mAh) every 10 to 20 minutes, if you're lucky and keep LCD and flash off. It will take a century to respond after you press the shot button and another century to process the picture.I tried to contact Canon but I guess their customer support is just like their camera - it doesn't work!Do yourself a favor: don't buy a Cannon A300.Paulo May - Brazil"
3,"OK, but that's it","This camera is affordable and I should perhaps not expect any better.To sum up. It is qutie big, but that I knew when I bought it. But on the other hand it doesn't weigh that much. The quality of the pictures are good. The camera has a few times reset its clock. Making me having to set the clock before I could take the picture. There are also some troble taking the picture. You should press the button half down and wait for the camera to focus and be ready before you press it all the way down to take the picture. Otherwise it sometimes refuses to take the picture. It also takes a looooong time to take a picture. Making you miss some spescial moments. Otherwise however it works fine. It is easily installed, and used with the PC."
4,Great for taking the step from 35mm Digital,"The Canon A300 packs a lot of features for a low price. Its user friendly, has a good internal zoom lens and comes with great photo editing software. I strongly recommend getting recahrgeable batteries. The best thing is that I can shoot all the pictures I want and then edit them later. If you're wary of making the change from film to digital, don't be. This camera makes it painless for the digital novice and the pictures are very nice."
2,keep looking,"I liked the camera for the most part but is was cheap feeling, light, and plastic feeling. I took it back because the flash reload time was near 10 seconds between photos, it could have been me but it did have new batteries and I even contacted customer support to find out if there were any adjustmenrs I could make, they were of little help but did respond quickly. My advice, Try the A70 or a Kodak, I bought the A70 and am much happier, the flash reload time is minimal. If you are interested in cheap megapixels though I could find no better value in the market from a reliable manufacturer."
3,Installing the software is an exercise in futility,"Installing the software for this camera was a nightmare. It turns out there were conflicts with the Install Shield feature built into Windows. Contacting Canon thorugh e-mail and phone turned out to be an exercise in futility. I did a web search on the error message (1607), and found there are many others using Canon products having this problem. I ended up having to reinstall Windows. When I contacted Canon, I simply asked them if they knew of a downloadable patch to facilitate downloading their software. They told me to contact Install Shield. Install Shield's website refers you back to the manufacturer (Canon). Had I known about the level of hassle I would experience in advance, I would have purchased an Olympus."
1,Problems...problems,"I am not a novice when it comes to digital cameras; but after following the instructions to the letter, I never got one picture from this camera. And, it devoured the batteries that came with it, plus the special Ni-MH Canon batteries that I purchased separately."
1,"Nice pics, but eats batteries...","I ran through two sets of new AA's in one days shooting (no flash used). I tried the rechargeable NiMH's, they ran down even faster. I use it now as a studio camera with an AC adapter."
1,Please don't buy this!!!!,"It might take ok pictures, it might be an entry level camera, but..IT'S CUMBERSOME TO USE AND THE BATTERIES DON'T LAST MORE THAN 15 MINUTES. PLEASE, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT....AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!"
2,Digital zoom == no zoom,"Digital zoom is not worth anything -- any computer graphics program can give the same (or better, thanks to sophisticated algorithms which can't run on a camera) effect by cutting out a picture from a non-zoomed digital image.Optical zooms are expensive (a few bucks!), so we see even expensive digital cams only have digita zoom, where in the past even el cheapo analog cams had optical zooms up to 30x. Nowadays you have to be grateful for a 3x optical zoom on a $700 videocam or digicam...."
3,Batteries?!?,"My first digital camera, so I'm learning all the basics. I love it so far except for one MAJOR drawback. I have gone through SIX AA batteries so far. It goes through batteries in about 10 minutes of photography. The ones that came with it lasted about five minutes. I then bought a pack of Duracell M3 and it burned through them too. I now bought a Monster AA rechargable pack...we'll see how those work. Am I not supposed to use the LCD screen for shooting and viewing all the time? Should I just use the viewfinder for pictures and then use the LCD screen for viewing/editing later? Can anyone help me? Should I return it for another one? Is it defective? I love Amazon, gadgets and computers...but I'm baffled here."
1,Battery Guzzler!,"We knew about its short battery life, but we bought it anyway. Now we regret it. The battery lasted only for about 20 pictures with flash. Had we known this as a fact, we wouldn't have bought this camera."
3,The Jury Is Still Out,"I recently purchased this camera with high expections. So far the jury is still out. This is a good beginners camera, and beginners will love the picture quality vs that of 35 mm. I also love the fact of being able to print pictures directly from the camera (with the printer it comes with) without having to use a pc. The cons are this camera goes through batteries. I am thinking about buying stock in a battery company. After pressing the shutter button, the camera takes it's time to produce the image. The user's guide is wordy. I just sat down one weekend and read through the guide and practiced with the features on my camera, only to have my batteries die out twice during the process."
3,"Nice Pictures, but Tragic Flaw","I purchased this camera a while ago, and while I was generally pleased with the picture quality and other functionality, the camera has an intolerable flaw: the slow shutter time. It takes an eternity between the time you press and hold down the button and the time the picture actually takes. This gets pretty embarrassing and frustrating when you're asking other people to take pictures of you and your friends. I got sick of saying ""You have to hold it down for a long time...even longer...there we go"" I gave up in the end, and bought a different camera."
1,TERRIBLE,"The stuff smells great, maybe that is why the mosquitoes seems to swarm to the areas where I sprayed it.I actually believe it made the situation worse."
3,meh,The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa by Long et al is a much better and more organized book. I wouldn't recommend this book unless it was assigned to you for a class.
3,Too short but....,"Although this book is very short, shorter than the other TT books, my 1yr old loves the touch and feel sections. The book is physically tough and he ""reads"" it by himself (...)"
2,too short,"This book is way too short. It's only really about 6 pages long. Also, the infamous ""bag"" is OK with me, other cultures and/or homosexuality don't bother me... but it sticks to the opposite page which makes page turning difficult at times. Overall, I'd say your money is better spent elsewhere unless you have a kid who is crazy about teletubbies (mine really isn't, but then again, my kid's only 8 months old)."
5,Captured My Heart,"Radclyffe has done it again! I loved this book! This book has everything a good book should have: plot, great characters, humor, romance, and as Radclyffe does best sex. Jessie and Kate are as great together in this book as in the first and I also loved Mae the first time around. I was glad to see that she finally got what was coming to her! The introduction to Vance was a wonderful addition. I hope that there is more story for these 4 amazing women...as I am sure you will see the possiblities for future books as I have! Radclyffe always leaves you hoping for more..."
4,Good,This was a good book with characters from the first book Passionate Kisses. But it was based on not so much Jesse and I would have like that better. Mae is a good character but I just related to Jesse better.But that is my hang up.
2,"Good summary, but WAY out of date","This book has a good summary of the beta version of the Java3D API. Unfortunately, the book hasn't been updated since then, and the API has significantly changed. This is a reference book, and it contains very sparse overall descriptive information.As a reference book, it's very frustrating and difficult to use, because so much of the API has changed.As an overview book, it contains some good information, but not much.I'm not really happy with this book on either count."
