5,Great twist on the Classic Paper Mario.,"I scored this on special, and I got so addicted to it. You get to play Mario, (later unlock other characters), who can flip from the basic 2D mario world, and turn it into a 3D world, which adds another dimension to our favourite, loved, game.Pros:Basic graphics, but it ads a more retro feel, like from the old Paper Mario games.The storyline & game was very well planned & developed through-out the game.Lots of Mini-quests & games to unlock/complete/discover when you finish the game.Great accompanied music.Very small learning curve, you learn as the game progresses without feeling lost or confused.The controller gives an old school mario feel when held sideways.Cons:Dialogue is very heavy, its not fun spending 20 minutes catching up on the storyline.Only 1 Player, not very family-friendly.Controller didn't take much advantage of the hardware the Wiimote has to offer.Some sections are frustratingly boring."
5,Simply Brilliant!,"Bottom line, if you own a Wii, get this game and play it. Everything about this game is brilliant. The gameplay is fun and there's hours upon hours of stuff to do, including tons of secrets. The game looks incredible and is ridden with vibrant color. The soundtrack is brilliant and memorable, and even the writing and narrative are top-notch for a video game. However, don't expect this to be exactly like previous games in the Paper Mario series. While the witty writing, visual style, and some of the series' more definitive extras are still here (such as cooking items), Super Paper Mario deviates from the RPG formula of its predecessors and focuses more on platforming and puzzles, while still keeping Action-RPG elements such as HP, leveling up, having a party of characters, and an inventory of items. I hope this was informative! Anyway, anybody who has a Wii should get this game and I promise you won't be disappointed!"
4,Easy Mario,"I was expecting this to be horrible based on the reviews, but I thought it wasn't that bad. I didn't play the original Paper Mario though.The game is pretty easy. You can beat everything without dying and you won't get stuck trying to figure out a puzzle.The only annoying thing was the DIALOGUE. I was ready to turn the game off in the beginning because it was 15 minutes of talking and you cannot skip through it.Super Paper Mario is easy enough for kids and nice for adults who enjoy Mario. It's not an extremely challenging game so it works when you want something light and non-stressful to play. They should have fixed the excessive talking though =/"
2,The game for gamers who love reading captions,"I've never had a problem with the endless reading and dialog in RPGs until Super Paper Mario. The reason being that the game play piece was ratcheted up to a really fun level and every time you got into a groove, you had to stop and read. It's weird to not like a game for being too good in one area, but the assets are so missbalanced, that I was completely frustrated."
3,"NINTENDO, PLEASE REMOVE 90% OF THE WORD BUBBLES!!!!","This was the first game I purchased for Wii. It was fun, but at times it was so frustrating!!!! I spent 80% of the game clicking through word bubbles, which cant be avoided. At times I was so annoyed that I wouldnt touch the game for days. Aside from the lame story and word bubbles, it was neat. This game requires using your mind, it's not your basic ""get-to-the-end-of-the-level"" game. Sometimes you have to go back and forth through a level to ask people questions etc. I repeat...this game requires intelligence and critical thinking skills, if you dont have those things, DONT buy this game!!!"
1,Worst of the series,I am a HUUUUGE fan of the paper mario series. The first one being my favorite. I liked the thousand year door one almost as much. But this game was just awful. it didn't have any of the elements that made the first two games so likeable. Exept that he's paper...I don't recommend this game.
2,Too much dialogue,"Unlike previous Mario titles, you can't just pick up ""Super Paper Mario"" and start crushing goombas. The game is so thick with dialogue that it distracts from the game. I just wanted mindless fun. You have to worry about equipping items, purchasing gear, leveling up, and using the 2D/3D ""flip"" ability to discover secrets (usually these secrets are required to progress further into the game).The game is too complex for an action game and too simplistic for a RPG. I am still at a loss as to how to describe it. One would think that Super Paper Mario would find a cozy middle ground, but it doesn't. It's a pity, too. Super Paper Mario would be a strong title if its fast-paced gameplay wasn't bogged down by heavy exposition.Oddly, I do suggest this game for parents looking for Wii games for their kids. Super Paper Mario reveals patches of rather sophisticated dialogue that kids, especially those who enjoy reading, will most likely find engaging."
1,Super Mario Paper,"I bought this in September for Christmas (I start early every year)for my son, so it was not opened until then, and the disk was unreadable. My son was very disapointed. I tryed contacting the seller and i have yet heard from them. I highly would not recomend buying from this seller!"
1,So not an RPG,You call THIS an RPG? This game is... truly disappointing if you are a fan of Paper Mario. It has no turn-based function what-so-ever! And Mario can't go in all directions unless flipped into 3D! This game isn't even worth renting. Waste of Money.
2,Mario diluted,"You make no friends by saying bad things about a Mario game, but this is my honest opinion. Nintendo would have been better off to make a simple, fun side-scroller in the style of New Super Mario Bros (DS) instead of this.The art style is brilliant, as is the character design, and the platforming areas are usually great fun. But the game is let down severely by the pace: for every fun platforming area, there's twice as much irritating, unnecessary talking, hunting for items, and using the gimmicky ""flip to 3D mode"" to find secrets. I was actually relieved when I found Save Points in the game so I didn't have to keep playing.I thought that the Wii was meant to feature lots of pick up and play games - a criteria the standard, start-to-finish platformer would have fulfilled nicely - not ones that dilute what made games featuring Mario great in the first place. Really, really disappointing."
1,Don't waste [...] Bucks on this!,"This game was awful! My seven year old had to have me read 20 minutes of dialogue boxes with words like ""dimensionality"", ""Void"" and ""Minions"" before the 1980s type game actually started. Actually, this is more like something that would have been exciting circa 1974. [...] We will never play this again!"
1,Disappointing,Not what I expect. Too much reading and actually I am not even sure how to play the game. I wasted about 10 min reading what they said before I can have my first move. Maybe someone needs to show me how to play or do I really need to buy a guide book??!!
2,"Starts off well, gets worse as you play it","Super Paper Mario is a tragic example of what can happen to a celebrated franchise after 25 years; It's a game that starts out strong, but gets progressively worse as you play it. This Mario game will probably draw you in from the start with its charming art style and numerous references to older games, not to mention the ability to shift from 2D side-scrolling to 3D exploration at a moment's notice, which lets you look at old levels in a whole new way. Unfortunately, somewhere around halfway through things take a turn for the worse, by forcing you to play through levels filled with tedious backtracking, unclear goals and merciless repetition that all add up to a frustratingly boring experience. All in all, you might enjoy Super Paper Mario as a rental, but it won't take long before it overstays its welcome. Don't be fooled by the title; This Mario is far from Super."
2,disappointed,"You would surely be disappointed if you played Paper Mario and wished to play something similar but more fun ... Super Paper Mario is not at all compatible to the original Paper Mario. In some ways, it is like Super Mario Brothers that was published some 20 years ago, but not as good.I liked Paper Mario on Gamecube because it was different and fun. But Super Paper Mario gives nothing special. It may not be the most boring game, but is lacks creativity: it seems the designers ran out of ideas and had to fill up the game with repetitive tricks and made-up dialogs."
2,Children will not be able to read extensive dialog,"I rented this game from gamefly.com and I hate it. They should have kept the mario side scrolling theme and kept with the mario formula (run, jump, fly, swim, castle). I'm probably the biggest mario fan so I'll just break down my pro's and con's now.Pros: It's mario in a paper thin form (adorable), the flip thing is so-so.Cons: I had to first watch the annoyingly long intro (and they used slang???) I swear I must've hit the (a) button a million times to get thru all the dialogue. My 6 year old who has trouble reading would not have the patience to read all those dialogue bubbles (rediculous!!!). I let him read one bubble (which he did pretty good) but the dialogue just kept coming and coming (utterly rediculous!!!)Probably the worst mario game nintendo ever co-signed."
4,Nintendo is running out of ideas these days...POSSIBLE SPOILERS,"This was the first Wii game I actually bought and played ever since I've purchased Wii more than two months ago! I had been played it for four days now and am currently on chapter 5-1 and got stuck thanks to some ridiculous puzzle! I guess I DO need the Nintendo Power guide after all. Anyway, I really liked everything the game has to offer except for one thing, the storyline! Even though I never finished this game yet, I already am able to figure out what this game is all about! Yes, although I won't get into any details but it actually is a very simple sad soap opera which is a very disappointment to say the least."
3,Where's the Wii technology?????,"As a parent, I'm pretty disappointed. We invested in the Wii system to get our kids off the couch, and my kids are thoroughly enjoying Super Paper Mario...ON THE COUCH!While it's a great video game, it's NOT a great Wii game. It doesn't take advantage of any of the Wii capabilities, so you might as well play it on a GameCube. (Ok, you do shake the remote to wake Mario up occasionally, but that's about it.)After being so impressed with other Wii games and the amount of moving around you do to play them, this was a huge let-down! C'mon Nintendo!!!"
1,Jipped and dissapointed,"Like some real rpg paper Mario fans. we expected an rpg, not a side scrolling Mario bros game with bowser as a playable character. this is a terrible let down. But the n again its not the worst game its not for rpg fans like me its for little kids and those who enjoy Mario bros a whole lot. My friend brought and I thought it was going to be one of those long and good adventure rpgs like the first and second one. I say if you have a little extra money why not buy it or rent it before you buy it to see if you like it. For those who want the original lets hope nintendo makes a better 4th one, or settle for this."
1,Super Essay Paper Mario,Love to read VOLUMES of text for hours. Then this is your game. This game is just horrible. I can't believe it's a Nintendo product. I knew that it wasn't going to be a Super Mario Bros. type game but wow this was bad. The graphics are laughable and I'm not one to care about graphics. The game play isn't even that fun. You spend more time walking to places with the slow poorly rendered characters then you do trying to figure out what to do. But good god the text in this. I've never seen a game with this amount of reading. I would love to see the script for this game because i would guess it would hundred's of pages long. Some of the writing is a bit witty. But after reading for 20 or more minutes you could care less about some witty quip Mario just said. Please do not waste any money on this game. Just do yourself a favor and buy a book. You'll read less with a book.
3,Kinda Boring... and annoying,I was a huge fan of the last couple Paper Mario games. This one annoys me because it's not as deep or challenging as an RPG (like past games) and not as fast and fun as a regular Super Mario. It's the worst of the best worlds combined. It comes off as more of a bad action game or a simple RPG... it's too easy and too slow. Way too slow to be an action game and way too thin to be an RPG. Didn't like it. Spent about 10 hours playing it. I'd rather play something else. The graphics are kind of crappy. The music will put you to sleep. Wish they would have just made another regular Paper Mario game. Hopefully they'll put Mario's old RPG's on the Wii download service. Looking more forward to those.
3,An okay rental,"Once you get past the 20-odd minutes of pointless backstory, you are ultimately treated to a cute, gimmicky little game that definitely has some entertainment value. Some of these gimmicks are interminably clever while others feel like afterthoughts the developers came up with late at night when faced with the task of integrating the Wii remote's special features by any means necessary. The latter tend to grow tiresome in a hurry, and navigating around in 3D mode is unnecessarily difficult, but it's still kinda fun to play and worth renting at least. I got mine for $30 used and feel that money could have been better spent elsewhere."
2,BEWARE: Nothing like Paper Mario 1,"I bought this game only because I had so much fun with the first one. I was hesitant because of some of the poor reviews but I bought it anyways. This game has a lot of unnecessary dialog in it and its a lot of just sitting there and clicking through it. The story line it self isnt even all that great either. Besides that this game plays nothing like the first one. Yeah it has 3-D in it which was kind of neat but it was mostly confusing and irritating. In this game you cant even battle with the enemies. You stomp on them just like all the other mario games and IF you want to use any items you must first avoid that enemy and then go to menu and choose what you want. It doesnt initiate a fight like the first one. I feel like I am playing a boring and slow version of regular Mario. this is definately not worth the money, thats why i am returning mine. Trust me, if you love good Mario games then this one is NOT for you"
5,It is a very good game!,"Hey am not a review expert but i got to say if you like Mario games and funny stuff, this is a very good game. I like it cuz of the style of it very good crazy story. good graphics nice songtrack and well the wimote is not really at full use here it has good control too. hope this helps :P"
4,WORDY jibber-jabber jibber-jabber blah blah blah,Fantastic game. VERY FUN.. but it took 23 (!) minutes of clicking thru inane dialog just to get to the first 'chapter' of actual game play. If they would only have an option to skip past all the story/crap it'd be perfect.
4,A great game for kids... who can read.,"A very fun game. Nothing like mario in the 2d setting... just nostalgic. I'm not a quick player so i'm pretty sure people can go through this game in a day but its an easy game to just pick up and play for a bit and set it back down. The puzzles aren't drawn out to long periods of time which allows this.There's a lot of dialogue who gives you hints on how to beat the level. Never played the first paper mario but compared to the older marios, it's not a straight 2D side panning race to the end. With different puzzles, which some involve information gathering from locals... you get stuck on some parts if you're like me who tries to skip dialogue cuz they're fillers to waste time. The plot is simple and short and though the levels seem to be from a cookie cutter set, expands from the previous marios with 3d pathways."
3,One player only,"I bought this in a rush during a Gold Box sale and I wish I would have checked it more thoroughly. This is only for one player, so my two sons have to take turns (this does not go over well, by the way). This is my own fault for not checking, but I wish I would have held out and just bought the Mario Galaxy (higher price, higher ratings, and one to two players capable). My sons do enjoy playing this one, though. If it had been designed for two players I would have given it a higher rating."
2,Not the best resource,"This book tries to ""do it all,"" but without all the information. The best source about medical schools--including profiles of accepted students, average MCAT scores for the class, GPA's, costs, and the courses that you need to get in is available from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Their web site, and the book they offer, ""Medical School Admissions,"" give the straight story. Combine the Association book with the med school reviews by students on the Web and you can get a good idea of where you should apply."
4,OK Source,"I would argue with the word ""complete"" in the title of this book. I used this book to get a good idea of various medical schools but I supplemented this information with other sources such as the AAMC website and the individual school websites. A few things are inaccurate. However, one nice thing about this book is that it is one of the few sources I've seen that includes a section on the ""non-traditional"" student. Most books are written for applicants that are about 20 years old and still in college. I'm 28 and have been out of college for several years. Older applicants typically have special questions, I was pleasantly surprised to find so many of my questions addressed in this section."
3,Should not be your only source of info,"This book is not complete by any stretch of the imagination. It is good, however, in that it provides things like addresses, phone numbers, and websites, so it serves as a good reference. Stoll's book should be used as a jumping off point, really (if you choose to invest in it). This book offers an extremely pared down look at a school, and if you are currently applying, will only be of limited use to you. To get the most accurate (and indepth) information, it would be better to look at websites and other materials. I found that the information offered in this book was NOT up-to-date. Secondary application fees and tuition data were not accurate, which makes me question if the other info is accurate. This would only be a worthwhile investment if you were a year or so from applying."
5,WITHOUT OUT A DOUBT THE BOOK THAT PUTS HITTING TOGETHER,"I'VE READ IT, I'VE PRACTICED IT, I'VE TAUGHT IT TO MY PLAYERS, IT'S A REALLY GREAT BOOK TO READ AND REFER BACK TO. EXCELLENT."
5,Absolute must for softball coaches,"I am a former coach and currently a hitting instructor to both boys and girls. Having been a former player where everything came naturally, I had no idea how to teach/coach hitting. This book was a true revelation. It helped with the basics, of course. But the true gift received from reading this book is getting the words to use when teaching/helping a hitter.I started out coaching my son's teams, but this book helped the most when I began coaching my daughter's teams. She ended up affiliated with a team that won a couple of national tournaments. I became hitting instructor to many of the players, coaching at one time or another, 21 players who received college softball scholarships. After my daughter finished college ball, she became a fine hitting instructor herself. We both still refer to this book regularly."
3,product ok company stinks,"The product arrived with their cheap, plastic ice bucket damaged.I reported to the company, who then wanted fax photos of the damage. Since I am incapable of that function, they demanded that I ship them the cheap, plastic bucket back to them for inspection. Granted, they finally reimbursed me for the shipping costs of the bucket to them and sent me a replacement bucket, the aggravation they put me through was ridiculous. They should have sent me a replacement cheap plastic ice bucket on my word.Did they think I was trying to rip them off for $1.50???"
2,Not happy with this product,"The wine rack came and it was all scratched up. The instruction were terrible, very hard to read and non descriptive with so many different types of screws. When we did put it together, there was a side that was warped, so one of the screws would not go in and no pre-drilled holes in the wood. The bucket that is included is also very cheap and came cracked due to the product being plastic. I would not have gotten this product if I knew that there would have been so many problems with assembly."
3,Maybe give it 2 1/2 or 3....of course,"I don't know 'bout this one 'cuz it maybe the one I'm livin' 4 right there. Not to say I hate it, but it's still good tho. It needs a lot of energy of the songs that Hugh is playing. Love the sound that he's doing on his flugelhorn. He's is definitely the next Miles Davis or Donald Byrd perhaps. Maybe even Chuck Mangione for example. He's actually a mentor I can depend on. Sooner or later, I maybe a mentor like him. 2 me I'm real good on playing the trumpet 'cuz that's a gift from God. Hope u recommend this to anybody who loves to hear good trumpet music."
2,A word of caution,"Deflating a very promising line-up of vintage Masekela material, six of the tunes here are recent remakes, including ""Vasco de Gama,"" ""Market Place,"" ""African Secret Society,"" ""Don't Go Lose It Baby,"" ""Stimela"" and (an especially crusty gesture) the title track. They're not bad, and Masekela's liner notes are frank and informative, but still ...."
5,Great Hugh Masekela compendium,"Very high audio quality, beautiful lush production, emotional and wide-ranging tour-de-force for Mr. Masekela. 30+years ago, Hugh introduced millions, including myself, to a genre of music that didn't even have a name then, but later came to be known as ""world music"". His music combines the best of african percussion and melodies with western instruments-horns,keyboard,bass, and drums- and achieves a sysnthesis that is greater than the sum of it's parts. Moving vocals, emotional melodies with the highest levels of musicianship, and even danceable! Not to be missed for any fan of world music."
5,FANTASTIC,"What a cool sensation this record is! Just let it wash over you like a warm summer breeze. The sophisticated, jazzy horn and outrageously melodic pieces on this CD are just wonderful - most notably Grazing In The Grass, with its infectious joy and Strawberries, with its interesting melody and wonderful, melancholy vocals. A must for everyone."
3,"a decent start on is Music,but","there are better overall Compilations on Hugh Masekela. now the title cut grooves&He has a signature Trumpet style of his own.there is alot more to His Talents&other stylings of Creativity that He has done over time.this is a decent Start,but you have to seek it out."
5,It covers it all,"A great book! Easy to understand, fast paced introduction to trading. I have read some other books that seem to repeat the same thing over and over through half the book, before getting to the nuts and bolts. But this one is constantly smooth to read from start to finish. I couldn't put it down till I was done."
2,Damon and Phythias,"I purchased this video because I'm a great Guy Williams fan, but found the film lacking. It had a poor story line and very little action."
4,good stuff,"Wynona Carr. Who was she? She was a great early R&B singer, much like Ruth Brown. If you like early R&R, buy this...."
2,One Step Beyond,"I have long been a fan of X, and of most of John Doe's solo work, so I feel obligated to be kind and respectful in this review.There is an obvious appeal to hearing acoustic versions of familiar songs, but in this case, the more raw versions do not do the band justice. In the original versions you can sometimes hear odd harmonies that work. On ""Unclogged"", the ""odd harmonies"" merely sound like two singers not in sync with each other... to put it kindly.That said, I would steer fans away from this album, and instead steer them toward their other release ""Beyond And Back: The X Anthology"". For solo work, I would also recommend John's ""A Year In The Wilderness""."
3,Shows X was more than just a punk band,"This was a perfect band to utilize in an ""unplugged"" format.I always knew that X was influenced by folk and country yet, that input did not really come out when the songs were done in the normal, high-energy punk mode. Although I found their first 4 albums enjoyable ""punk"", the duplicity of the music and songs made it easy to quickly tire of the material.""Unclogged"" takes X's best material, strips it down and shows it in a new light, as something much more than high energy, sterotypical punk songs but rather interesting and melodic songs. Everything from the vocals to the musicianship is much more expressive in the all-acoustic format. Similar to what Nirvana did, this live and unplugged cd showed that X was capable of much more than amplified angst.I find that this work showcases the band better than any other release"
5,The entire CD is great!!!,"You don't even have to be a fan of country music to love this CD, just a fan of Disney! Some of the best country artists provide great new renditions of Disney Classics. Great album, 5 stars all the way!"
5,Country Disney,"Love it! Love it! Love It! Best Disney tape. My grandchildren listen to it all the time in my car and they are age 7,13, 15, and 23. We all sing along for hours playing it over and over and over again."
5,Awesome Memories,I borrowed this from my cousin on audio cassette in the early 90s. And loved it from the first time that I heard it. I forgot about it as the years went by and suddenly thought to buy it from Amazon.I was quite disappointed that it wasn't available on CD. Until I saw that Amazon had 2 brand new in stock.It's a 'must have' for any country music fan that grew up watching the magic of Disney.
3,Old School Country,"So, I really just bought this CD for the one song- ""Part of Your World"" by Faith Hill. She's my favorite singer and ""The Little Mermaid"" is my favorite Disney movie. I thought it would be the perfect match. I like the song- it's definitely an older Faith song because her singing is a lot more twangy. If you are into older school country, such as Reba or Garth Brooks back in the day, I really recommend this CD. If you are more into pop country, like Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood, this may not be your cup of tea. It is pretty interesting, though, if you're a Disney fan, to listen to different renditions of your favorite songs. A happy surprise was ""If I Never Knew You"" from ""Pocahontas.""Let me know what you think if you buy the CD.Would buy from this seller again. Although, I wish that shipping was a bit cheaper. I think that I paid more for shipping than the CD itself."
2,Do not buy,I choose a bad rating because these shoes did not fit when I ordered my size. The instep seem to be higher than normal.I have since returned them to the company. I feel that this might be a knock of Stacy Adams
1,Hideous,This shoes are soo ugly! They are grey on the toe and heel only! The rest of the shoe is sage green UGG! What were they thinking. If you are looking for a grey/green shoe this will be the one. I returned them immediately!!Shipping was pretty fast.
2,Not true to color.,"My husband bought these to wear on our wedding day. When we got them, they had a greenish hue to them. They were also very snug in the toes. He ended up returning them."
2,Practically informative subjects...,"Sinus surgery was carried out by many rhinologists, Messerlinger, Wignad, Stammberger and Kennedy, et al. Endoscopic sinus surgery, especially applied to paranasal sinus diseases with inflammation. Recently minimal invasive endoscopic surgery is practiced based on small hole theory. Inflammatory paranasal sinus was radically removed on previous surgery. In minimal invasive surgery, passage was made for paranasal surgery, so normal mucosal recovery was promoted. In this book, informative practice and principle was well described for training course or expert surgeon. But long term follow-up and review is required to be proved for new practice."
5,Excellent!,"Listening to this work allowed me to take an inward journey to the depths of my soul. I've realized how precious and important achieving inner peace is to the core of one's being. Regardless of what bends in the road you may encounter, once you achieve an inner peace it will be a peace that surpasses all understanding."
3,The Worm Has It's Day...,"After surviving a brutal attack by a gang of Skinheads, our mainline ""Hero"" decides to avenge his girlfriend's suicide (a result of the attack where she was gang-raped) by infiltrating the gang as a fellow Skinhead ""Brother."" Eventually, he fits into the Gang and is able to seek his revenge upon the animals who changed his life.Was I shocked by the film's content? Nope. Was I impressed by it's production originality? Nope. Was the film's message worthwhile? I was already familiar with the act of revenge and the back-and-forth nature of retailiation.Strangely enough, I was drawn into the story and was thoroughly engrossed in the storyline. Am I ashamed that I liked the film? Maybe a little..."
3,Skinhead Subculture,"If you've gotten your views of what the ""skinhead subculture"" is based on a movie like this one... you are blind and unable to see that white power racists have hijacked a good image and made it bad.How about this?The original skinheads were both white and black and the music of choice was reggae which later spawned ska which in the 90s was a huge movement in the american music scene. A political organization told poor working class whites in the UK that if they would turn against the blacks they so harmoniously got along with that they would have better odds of having a good life. So they did so... and then SUDDENLY there's a worldwide ""white on black"" ""skinhead white power"" movement. Wow. Wonder who was behind it all? I wonder if he made a lot of money and if he's happy with himself."
4,Very revealing.,"This book is the most definitive one I've read on Gandhi. His incredible life and works were amazing. I learned a lot about this long suffering, compassionate man, who with all his faults, was a force for peace in this world."
3,Eye opening about Muslim relationships,Reinforced Gandhi's passion for peace. Didn't realize his formal background and education. It shed light on the religious passion and stubbroness of Hindu/Muslim relationship.
2,did not love it,"i was expecting to read more of Gandhi's words but this book is more about like a historic context, just very little of gandhi himself and thinking. too much like a text book"
4,Solvit Pet Booster Seat,"The seat was smaller than I thought it would be. It's good if the dog just sits up and looks out the window, but not a lot of room to lie down and be comfortable, even for a 6 pound chihuahua. I have a larger seat that holds 2 small dogs comfortably, even to take a nap, but the standard size one was just too small for even 1 dog."
4,Solvit Booster Seat,"This is a perfect little travel seat for my 6 lb chihuahua. My little dog loves it. The reviews I read about the product are all true with regard to the weak link in this seat. The strap that holds the seat up and around the head rest is poor quality. Mine has broken twice and my dog fell both times. I have had to devise my own strap. The metal clips on the dog seat are also poorly designed. If the manufacturer would correct this the seat would be great. I would not recommend this if you have a dog any bigger than a chihuahua, unless they correct this defect."
3,Booster Seat,"I ordered the seat from Amazon.com because I love the fast service and the free shipping. If you don't like it for any reason or it's not what you thought it would be, it is easy to return. Our chihuahua loves sitting in the seat because he is able to look out the window. The only thing I would change is if the padding was thicker and not able to come off easily. The dog scratches to make it soft and the fur inside comes off in clusters.I put a pillow inside, then a blanket to make it more comfortable."
2,Its Ok!,It's ok! I have never tried any other seat so I have nothing to compare it to. The one thing I hat most is the fact that it doesn't sit straight unless the seat is straight up and down. This makes it impossible to have a good fit in the back seat. The leash that is used to connect the dog is too long. I would never leave my animals unattended in this seat since they could try and jump out and hang themselves. If you have a very calm dog that will likely lay down and go to sleep then this seat is a good idea. Also the seat size is a little small for my 5 pound chiuahua. He can sit but not lay down. My 12 week old Min Pinscher fits very good but she is tiny and only 3 pounds. I dont think I would buy another.
5,Highly recommended!,"I LOVE this seat! I'm so happy I have one. I have a chihuahua/min pin and he fits perfectly in it. Only thing, he likes to chew on the security strap that gets attached to his collar. So I need to find a replacement soon. And he likes to shred the fur on the seat cover, so I put his blanket over that way he can chew on his blanket instead. Some friends think I'm crazy for having a 'doggy' car seat. I don't care, because it keeps him safe!"
2,HARD TO INSTALL,I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THE SEAT HAS TO BE INSTALLED IN THE SEAT-i HAVE A CHEVY sUBURBAN AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO INSTALL THE SEAT CORRECTLY-I DID NOT REALIZE THE INSTALLATION OF THE STRAPS WOULD HAVE SUCH AN IMPACT ON THIS PRODUCT-IT DOES NOT FIT WELL IN MY SUBURBAN-I WISH I HAD PICKED A DIFEERENT PRODUCT-
5,Best Asian American Anthology...,"...on the face of the planet! Thought-provoking, scholarly, angry, and entertaining. Anybody serious about the history and literature of Asians should read the BIG AIIIEEEEE!"
3,less about hermes than you think,"This book was pretty disappointing. a assortment of articles by Antoine Favre a professor at the Sorbonne. i could only get half way through before putting the book back on my shelf out of boredom . i coudl blame the translation but not in this case. i felt Antoine Favre really didn't have anything new or insightful to add to the historical or philosophical or even spiritual study of hermetiism . just some drawn out notes on the authors observations about classic texts referencing hermes the god and Hermes Trismegistus . its a good book to have for a collection of and on hermetica, but i feel it adds little to nothing , although it looks good on a shelf next to the hermetica thats about it. honestly i don't know why the author published this."
4,Essential Journey,"CDs work with no problems, shipped as promised, pleased with purchase. Songs on CD were a ""blast from the past"". Enjoyed listening to them once again."
4,Should be titled The Almost Essential Journey,"4 stars given because there are actually a ton of hit included on this compilation. Disc 1 is very nearly perfect and I have no complaints with it but disc 2 has me scratching my head. A few songs are included for no good reason and some other, more popular and essential songs were left out. Again, for no good reason.This set is not a bad deal for the price and isn't even a bad deal for disc 1 alone at the price. Still, it's hard to call something essential when it's missed the true essence."
4,"More of the same, but still good","Well, I have to agree with all the reviews on this site. Pretty much all the hits with Steve Perry are here, although there is no early stuff. The main gripe I have about this cd set is...what's the point? With Captured, Greatest Hits, Time 3 and Greatest Hits Live, what is the point of releasing yet another hits album? If you are going to go to overkill with this thing then how about putting on some new or unreleased stuff on it, like on Time 3? Give the fans something to buy. If you are new to Journey and want to get a good scope of their career then this cd set is great. If you are a fan who has been with them for the past twenty-five years of so, this set is a waste of time."
4,Not THAT essential,"Sony has decided to wring the last drop out of some of their biggest catalogue artists by releasing these 2-CD sets of so-called Essential works. This was appropriate for Billy Joel, who has 3 volumes of Greatest Hits that with trimming fit nicely on a 2-CD set.It is less appropriate for Journey.This set pretty much consists of a resequncing of the tracks on Journey's Greatest Hits for CD-1 (adding the comparatively recent When You Love A Woman) then a second CD bereft of hits and with material familiar only to those who already own the Journey back catalogue.Do yourself a favor and buy the single CD of Greatest Hits, then top it off with Steve Perry's own Greatest Hits package. Excluding Perry's solo tracks from this package is akin to leaving Paul McCartney's solo work from Wingspan.And by the way, does the beginning of Oh Sherrie sound to you like Perry is singing the lyrics ""Cinnamon gum""?"
5,Disc 1 is 5 stars. Throw disc 2 in the garbage!,"I love this CD, disc 1 that is. It has all their big hits! I always loved their music back when I was a junior high kid. It brings back great memories. Reminds me of those junior high dances and skating rink nights but I really love listening to them now that I am older. The first disc is just a collection of great, great music! This CD is a 2 CD set but they second CD really is a bunch of songs you probably never heard or that got much radio play. The first CD is great to chill out with playing LOUDLY with a glass of wine in hand when you want to relax! If you love Journey its worth the 20 bucks just for the Disc 1 alone!"
4,Hey Sunshine...,"The name of that song from Behind the Music you're looking for is ""WHY CAN'T THIS NIGHT GO ON FOREVER"" from their RAISED ON RADIO album."
5,Awesome,"I would recommend to anyone anywhere anytime , great Music and Band Grew up with this music and will die with this music"
3,Was this recorded off a vinyl album??,"Folks have already mentioned the missing songs. Real diehard Journey-heads would love a collection of their extended Jazz inspired songs. You know, the ones they don't play on pop-radio cuz they're longer than 4 minutes...Anyway, the sound quality is about par with a vinyl album ( and I listened to vinyl growing up ). The highs just are not crisp enough, and Steve Perry can hit some high notes. The power ballads wouldn't do well when the volumne is at 11. Sound quality is better on old AAD Peter Gabriel, ELP, and Steely Dan CDs.""Mother Father"" ... why?"
4,Still They Ride,"This is not a bad album, but it is not all that great either. If I were a casual fan or someone new to the group then this would be the album to buy (over their single disc GREATEST HITS or TIME CUBED box set).For a few bucks more you get all the songs from GREATEST HITS plus some ""Essential"" tracks like: CHAIN REACTION, AFTER THE FALL, STILL THEY RIDE, STONE IN LOVE, THE PARTY'S OVER, JUST THE SAME WAY & ANYTIME.However, there are some ""Essential"" MIA's like: SUZANNE, WHY CAN'T THIS NIGHT GO ON FOREVEER, DIXIE HIGHWAY, WALKS LIKE A LADY, TOO LATE & FEELING THAT WAY.As always not everyone will be happy with the song selection so accept what you're getting here. ESSENTIAL JOURNEY is a much better compilation than GREATEST HITS for not much more $$$, but it is no substitute for owning all the Steve Perry Journey discs as I do. This is still the best disc available for casual fans with a lot of their better songs."
1,Field Training Police Recruits,It would be cheaper to contact the Police Department(s) that the author copied their FTO manuals from. Would not buy again.
4,Hilarious,"A cross between ""Bob the intergalactic hero"" and ""Myth."" A fun read for those sci-fi and fantasy fans who don't mind a good laugh."
4,Fantasy for the new Millennium,"Considering myself an avid fan of fantasy(from J.R.R.Tolkien to Micheal Moorcock and Everything between), I would have to say that I am impressed by G.D.Morrow's portrayal of the fantasy gendre. He broaches subjects that few others have, and in such a manner you are left beliving these are genuine characters. I look forward to see in what direction the adventure continues!"
4,Excellent debunking of miracle claims,"Looking for a miracle is a high work of scholarship showing that miracle claims have naturalistic and scientific expalnations. Through a careful analysis of the facts, Nickell shows how all of these so called ""miracle claims"" are nothing more than wishful thinking based on FAITH not FACT. Nickell is unbiased and impartial and does not scorn religious beliefs, but merely shows why they are not miracles. Excllent chapters on the shroud of turin and the so called ""incorruptables"". Good book for those who are rational thinkers, not belivers."
2,par for Nickell,"Nickell is a major-league dip. He doesn't research his facts fully, and--despite his claim that he's interested only in the scientific method and, above all, the truth--he is certain to prejudge everything as false and select only that ""evidence"" that supports this position. He reminds me of one of his younger fellows from CSICOP--Underhill or Underwood or something--whom you always see on TV. That fellow will go off about, oh, sasquatch or some such, dismissing eyewitness reports, films, and such with general comments about people having seen bears. Generalities are just fine, but they do not serve as an off-the-cuff, zero-thought-required refutation to any and every possibility that presents itself!"
5,"A brilliant, unbiased examination of miracles","Nickell carefully examines various miracles ranging from uncorruptible corpses to stigmata, and offers his own credible explanations. This is a good introduction to the topic, a welcome change from the gullible tabloid-type journalism we see so much of. A must for anyone, skeptic or believer, who wants to hear the other side of the story."
3,"Good enough, but not Great..spins alot","Sevylor Inflatable Tahiti Classic Kayak is pretty good if you want something portable to use and don't have the funds to get a real kayak. Sevlor Skeg is a must have add on to avoid ""some"" of the known spinning of inflatables. Overall it's decent function wise, very durable, and looks good, but if I were to do it again, I would go and purchase a real kayak for my purposes. The constant instability (spinning) got a bit annoying, but it's possible to keep straight if you work together as a deligent team.So it's just okay from me."
4,Good purchase,"I have used my inflatable kayak 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. It inflates easily and handles easily. Appears to be made of durable material. Because it is inflatable, it is affected by wind more than other kayaks, so I recommend purchasing and using a skeg with it."
3,"Only uses two Boston valves, steers with difficulty","This inflatable canoe does not handle easily, drifting from side to side constantly. It floats fine. Be aware that the valves are actually a mix of Boston valves and the pool toy variety (which means inflating by mouth, which means moisture gets trapped inside)."
2,Flimsy and fragile,"We were disappointed that it took more time to inflate this boat than the time that we could enjoy it. The boat was comfortable to sit in on land. In the water, the boat is hard to steer and kept turning in circles (we are experienced kayak users). Ten minutes into its maiden voyage, our boat brushed up against a stick and tore a 6 inch gash along its bottom. Vacation ruined. When I contacted their customer service, they sent me a polite acknowledgment email, but nothing more - NO HELP!"
5,Amazing Rain,"This is a great piece because of its compelling and fearless approach. It brilliantly explores the subjects melancholia for the land while expressing a clear fear of technology-- a dehumanizing catalyst in the eyes of Sam Brown. In sum, it is a dark yet touching story that leaves you feeling strangely warm inside, and thinking about the other."
4,cute book,"very cute book, a lot of unique humor and artwork. The crudeness of the drawings is one of the best things about the author's humor and storytelling."
4,Complete Season 2 The Brady Bunch,"I grew up watching the Brady Bunch and now my children, ages 5 and 9, enjoys watching it too. It is a nice, clean, family show to watch, unlike so many other shows on in today's world."
5,Perfect for a 7 year old girl,"Who would of thought that when I watched these episodes as a child, I would one day want to share them with my own child!We had long car ride on a weekend get-a-way, and these shows were perfect good wholesome entertainment for my 7 year old daughter to watch the entire trip!They bring back great memories!"
4,The Bradys,I bought this for my niece (10) who somehow became a fan (thanks Nick@Nite?)I watched a few episodes with her and none of the cheesy magic has really faded. Its become a bit of a passing of the torch in our house.Nice way to live a few memories with kids.
1,2nd Season - Brady Bunch DVD,Fantastic to be able to see all the old shows in the sequence we first saw them!
3,"Great Show, Disappointing DVD Set",I'm glad the Brady Bunch is finally on DVD. (What took so long?)But why are there absolutely no extras?Sherwood Schwartz has always struck me as a cheap bastard. Perhaps he would have to share more of the DVD revenue with the cast if they participated in commentaries and interviews.It's a shame. All these discs contain are the episodes. Nothing more.
4,"Well crafted, in word & deed",Mike Mignola has done it again with an excellent addition to the series. The mythos of Hellboy grows deeper and Mignola reveals some of his frustrations and sidetracks in creating the seminal character. Included are the failed rough drafts for the second story-an entire narrative scuttled because it wasn't quite right. Attention to detail like this make the noir adventures of Hellboy that much more enjoyable.
5,"Read all of them, then read them again","I love the drawings, the characters and the storyline. And even more the questions it brings. Soul, evil, love, destiny, God, ""Why am I here?""It isn't a distraction from the most important things in my life, its a chance to see them through another lens."
4,a slice of heaven,"the content of this book is divine, jeffery vallance does the art world a service by curating this show so thoroughly and sincerely"
5,Book review,The book was historical fiction which I enjoy. Easy flow and will be enjoyable for my children when they are old enough to read it.
1,STRICTLY FOR POP FANS,"Most of the songs on this collection are crossover pop stuff and if you like Britney SPears, Paula Abdul, Whitney Houston then this is the CD for you. If you like Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, or Patty Loveless then you will hate this collection. I love Tammy, Loretta and Patty so therefore......"
1,I'D FORGET THIS ONE.,"They may have been hits but not by my standards. If you want a real greatest hits package try ""Reba's Greatest Hits Volume I or II"". I'd leave this one alone."
1,JUST MEDIOCRE POP STUFF,"For die-hard Reba fans this will be just fine. However, I consider myself a music lover and I know what sounds good and what I prefer. I do not like pop music. That is why I did not give this more than one star because thats all it is. Songs like ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"", ""Take It Back"" and ""Why Haven't I Heard From You"" are just noise!! The ballads are o.k. but they can't compare to stuff she's done before and done better."
5,SO MANY GREAT SONGS.....ONE GREAT ARTIST!,"This CD is LOADED with amazing music by none other than Reba McEntire! Each song is special and unique in it's own way and each was a hit! Reba also includes 3 new songs on this album""I'm A Survivor"" which was a Top 5 smash, is also the theme song for her HIGHLY successful TV series!""Sweet Music Man"" was her tribute song to the late Waylon Jennings!""Myself Without You"" is about discovering inner strength after love has gone wrong.This CD should be in EVERYONE's collection!"
5,The Incomparable Reba!,"Country music would not be what it is without this lady... Reba has such a glorious voice; her range and depth are outstanding!! This greatest hits Vol. III CD is a fan's dream... I listen to all types of music, R&B, Jazz, Classical and Rap... but I must say, this country lady has me constantly coming back for more... You're wonderful, Reba!!!"
4,Real Reba,"I see a number of 1 star reviews for Reba's Greatest Hits Vol. III and most all those people seem to have as their gripe that this album isn't ""country"" enough, like Reba is some kind of a traitor to her ""true"" music. Well, I think it's up to the artist to decide what music he or she makes, and if Reba decides to alter things a bit, so what? In any event, it's not like this is some kind of radical deviation into a genre completely different from her 80s stuff. This is REba's stuff from the 90s and is still most definitely recognizable as country. Reba's voice is powerful as ever. The songs here center on Reba's vocals and storytelling. The best tunes:Heart is a Lonely HunterNight the Lights Went out in GeorgiaTake it BackWhy Haven't I Heard from YouOne Honest Heart"
1,WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE SO OVER PRODUCED?,"I agree with most of the reviews here. Reba tends to overdo everything. A lot of these songs would have been o.k. with simple arrangements (like more country....hint, hint) but as is most of her stuff its full of rich, full, orchestrations and what seems to be all the background singers conglomerated together in Nashville. The result is mediocre and this greatest hits package in no way begins to touch her first one which was sensational and her second which was good but not as good as the first!"
2,REBA HAS BETTER SONGS THAN THIS FOR A GREATEST HITS PACKAGE!,"Reba McEntire is a good singer. The material she picks though or is picked for her and whatever the company decides to release as singles are another story. This is an album that falls substandard to her two previous greatest hits packages. Perhaps that as time has progressed she has allowed herself to stick to a formula, aimed at a ""younger audience"" and I'm not THAT old (37 to be exact)...the younger audience being the teeny bopper audience which most of these songs are geared to. After all, they are the ones buying the records out there. Its too bad because the material doesn't do her voice justice!!"
3,Lacks a few of her better hits,"I don't understand some of the selections made for this greatest hits package. How could they leave off such great songs as ""How Was I To Know"" the only #1 hit from What If It's You, ""I'd Rather Ride Around With You"" a #2 hit from What If It's You, ""It's Your Call"" from It's Your Call shot to #5, and the best track from Read My Mind the #2 ""Til You Love Me"". I was thrilled to see that ""Fallin' Out Of Love"" (a #2 hit for her back in '91) made it to this compilation considering it had been left off Greatest Hits II. Now if they wanted to put a #15 song on here they should have put ""What If It's You"" with ""She Thinks His Name Was John"". Otherwise, this is an ok collection concentrated mostly on Reba's mid to late 90's hits. ""One Honest Heart"" should have been left off and in its place could've been an actual hit. I'd have to say that this is an incomplete CD of hits."
1,BLINK!,I sort of blink when I think of this greatest hits package. It is inferior to the ones which preceded it.
1,ONE WONDERS HOW????,"One wonders how the songs on this compilation ever came be hits in the first place? This is NOT the REBA I know and love! I agree that there is no mobility in her songs...they all sound alike...and there is nothing that sets Reba apart anymore. She, Shania, Martina, and Faith are all the same."
1,Mediocre Compared to her Two Previous GH packages,"Her first and second greatest hits packages are well worth the money. This one is not. It will indeed take a lot for Reba to please me these days. Its been a long time since she has done so. This CD contains many of her ""so called hits"" but there's very little substance to them compared to what she used to record and what is contained in her two previous Greatest Hits packages. I say No to this one."
1,"Reba, I Miss You","It's been a while since I listened to anything new from Reba so I borrowed this CD from a friend to see what she's been up to. I have to tell you that what I heard on this new collection of ""greatest hits"" only reinforces why I gave up on Reba in the first place.She seems to have forgotten what country music sounds like and has gone for a whole different market. About the only thing country about Reba these days is her accent. Two of the few songs that can make me run to change radio stations are on this CD: ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" and ""I'm a Survivor.""I really miss hearing new country songs from Reba and hope someday that she will rediscover her roots but, as long as Reba sees herself as some kind of singing feminist, I guess the wait will continue. What a shame."
1,IF THIS IS A GREATEST HITS PACKAGE....,I must ponder my tastes in music. I obviously am not hearing what everybody else is because I think most of this material is inferior to the two previous greatest hits collection from a fine country singer.
1,THIS CD IS NOT COUNTRY AT ALL!,"Reba McEntire provides us with good ""pop"" samples here but they are not to be classified under ""country"" music at all. There is nothing in this package that resembles true country music in any way, shape or form. Pop music yes, not country. The CD fails miserably in this department."
1,A BIG WASTE OF MONEY,"If you are going to buy this CD, I would suggest you look for it at cheap prices from Amazon used sellers. It isn't worth paying full price at what CDs cost today. Not only that but the quality of the music here is so bad that I if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't buy it at all. Its such a shame to because Reba has a great voice. Too great to be saddled down with such terrible material."
1,SORRY!,"This CD was just an excuse to highlight two new singles, one of which is ""Im a Survivor"" (a terrible song). But the rest of the songs (the greatest hits) aren't much better. Its all Reba's maze of pop stuff...inconsistent and not worthy of her talent. MCA needed to put something out because Reba went Hollywood around this time trying to be an actress (which, in my opinion, she would have done better to leave well enough alone). So she didn't record because she was burned out. Its no wonder with stuff like ""One Honest Heart"", ""How Was I to Know"" and other unmemorable Reba tunes. Nothing grabs the heart here like her other greatest hits packages that contained Reba classics like ""Somebody Should Leave"", ""Whoever's In New England""...you get the picture. There are no classic Reba songs on this compilation."
2,"Meow, Meow...","Am I the only one that thinks she meows when she sings? She has a powerful, but extremely annoying voice that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end, but for the wrong reasons.I've only heard about half of the songs on this record, but from what I have heard, I won't be buying it.Meow."
1,SORRY SONGS FROM SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE GOOD!!,"If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one. This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to ""do what sells"". This collection is phony...just like the lady herself."
5,A beautiful visualization,"I thought this book was excellent and am anxious to continue with ""To Bethlehem"". Mark's insights into the spiritual world was extremely fascinating and very respectfully accomplished. I only can't believe the series isn't finished."
1,Not exactly Biblical...,"I'm afraid if a book claims to be Biblically based and isn't, I can't give it high marks. This author places angels as created before Genesis 1:1 (as far as I can tell), yet the Bible teaches angels are created and that everything that was created, seen and unseen, was created in the six days of Gen. 1:1-31 (see Colossians 1:16, Exodus 20:11). Beyond that, at least from our angel-eye view, God comes across as rather limited and unknowing, having the think up solutions as trouble happens. Yet scripture repeatedly says that God had already chosen who was to be saved before creation. As in, He already knew we would rebel before we were even created! He knew where free will lead. Thus, I can't be impressed with this author's take even on free will."
2,For philosophers only,"It is interesting that Plato uses Socrates as his voicebox. I wonder how much Socrates would really agree with all Plato says. I mused at how Plato has those listening to his arguments always agreeing with him (""It must be as you say"", ""How could it be otherwise?"" (paraphrased). Considering that Greece is the birthplace of what we consider modern democracy, I was surprised, no stunned, at the number of communistic philosophies Plato expounds. Children are not to be raised by their birth parents, or even know who they are. Instead, they should be raised by the community. Children born with afflictions should not be reared (infanticide). No one should have more wealth than anyone else, etc., etc. This book is better enjoyed by hard core students of philosophy. I, as a casual reader, when not stunned by what I was reading found it rather boring."
4,Orthodoxy,This book of prayer has changed my life because of the great detail of prayer itself. As a Catholic Christian ther is greater detail on mercy and forgiveness. Another area that i was not accustomed to was declaring Mary as Theotokos (Mother of God).Only recentley did i discover the Great Schism in the year of 1054 and has now presented me with a brand new dilema.How do i respond to it and thru these prayers to find an answer to which way i will go.This book of prayer is so wonderfull.
3,Itsy Bitsy not for my baby,When I first tried these with her she liked it but when I tried a few more times she didn't like them. She was 6 months when I tried it. She is now 9 months and doesn't want to try them anymore.
2,Not Yoga,"The book as far as I could gather, contains postures that have nothing to do with traditional yoga, but were developed solely by the author for the use with babies. These are interspersed with various new-agey words of wisdom, called ""mantras"", and a lot of yoga-style talk, to yoga it up.I feel the title is misleading, it should have been called ""developmental movement"" or something like that, and not yoga.Yoga is an ancient set of postures and practices that have been proven to work over thousands of years. IMO you can't just come up with some new postures of your own and call that yoga, it is false advertising."
2,Rating for the Poor Kindle Version,"The low rating reflects the quality of the Kindle version, which is carelessly produced and definitely not worth the price of the item (which is the same as the Amazon price for the printed version.)There are photos missing throughout the Kindle version of the book, which is frustrating for those just learning the poses. Also, there are numerous page references in the book, and as the numbering of the Kindle version does not correspond to this, navigating the book is a major pain until you make your own bookmarks and hilights.Until these are corrected by the publisher I suggest avoiding the Kindle version and getting the actual book instead. Hopefully Amazon is listening and will send an updated version to those disappointed customers who bought the Kindle version!"
5,Love it !!!!!!! relived from Gas Pain,great book!! my 7 week old daughter is suffering from gasn pain and constipation from the start. The techniques given are very useful. I practice yoga regularly and happy this book helps my baby learn too!!:)I strongly recommend this product to every new mom
3,Great for what i payed,This book is worth what i payed for it. I like the pictures and the how to is great. It breaks it down easy and I am overall happy with it.
4,Itsy Bitsy Yoga,"Great book, it touches on all stages that a baby goes through. Each chapter is dedicated to newborns, head-holders, sitting, and crawling. A great opportunity for mommy and baby to spend time together."
5,Cooler performs well,"I have been using the product for about a month. The bottom of the portable computer is cool to my touch, so it is working properly and effectively. It is very quite.Leon"
3,Noisier than I thought,"When I read ultra quiet I was probably expecting too much. It's a bit noisier than the built in laptop fan.I also expected it to vent out the 1 inch gap in the back. It vents out the bottom. Still, I think it makes a decent passive laptop stand. I wish it was wider to fit wide screen 15"" notebooks."
1,piece of crap,"I got one of these in a different color, silver, same model #1000. worked fine for 6 months then cheap internal components quit working."
1,NOT QUIET AT ALL,"It is much much louder than my laptop fan. The noise sounds like electrical one and it is amplified by the fan noise. I don't understand how other reviewers can say that it is quiet. Maybe I've got defective one... Anyway, the one I've got produces unbearable noise. Of course, I returned it."
2,MORE needed,Air flow is weak. Toshiba satellite still overheats. Don't buy period. I paid 50+ for something that might give me an extra few minutes of a post purchased balancing act.
5,Excellent Quality!,"Normally I don't submit reviews on products, but this time is a must.The product has unbelievable quality I've ever seen in a laptop cooler.I've owned those plastic ones before, which did a good job in cooling my laptop, but, as I said, they were plastic.The Zalman Ultra-Quiet Notebook Cooler Model ZM-NC1000 is made of industrial grade aluminum and then anodized. There is NOTHING cheap about this cooler! Workmanship and design are EXCELLENT!A perfect size for my 14 incher, it has dual fans which the other one's I've used don't.I can see why this product has so many positive reviews.Try it, you'll like it. If not, you can always return it."
4,Solid build quality and quiet!,"The cooler is a little more expensive then most of the other coolers out there, but it really shows when you bring the cooler out of the box. Its aluminum casing feels expensive. I run a 15.4 gateway FX laptop and the cooler does a great job when I am not playing games my comps fan never turns on, the one thing you need to realize from a gamer standpoint is that your notebook is going to get hot playing games no matter what cooler you have. It is incredibly quiet especially compared to my computers fan.My one problem with this cooler was when it was shipped to me they gave me a female-male usb cord, and I had no way to hook up my laptop to my cooler, so I had to go on-line and order a male-male usb cord, I do wonder if this is a common experience. Another point of some concern is that it is not the best portable laptop cooler as it is quite heavy and the fan's intake are not set optimally for lap usage."
5,Excellent notbook cooler,"I was looking for a notebook cooler for my qosmio notebook, which heats tremendously when playing games or encoding videos. Found thisNotebook Cooler Blackin amazon among other notebook coolers and and decided to buy this based on the existing reviews. I am very pleased with this so far. I opted for the black color and it makes an awesome base for my notebook. Also it perfectly fits the 15.4 inch notebook base perfectly. The dial control for the fan speed is neat. Only if the USB cable is smaller it would have been perfect, atleast in my case. My notebook has a USB port on the right side and the connecting cable is little too long. Overall it is good value for the money."
2,Not for Gaming Laptops,The air flow is really weak and does not cool my laptop when Im gaming. My laptop still overheats and game shuts down.
2,Don't need to hook it up to USB port,"WOW! This thing really keeps my laptop cool...can't wait to see what it does when I get it hooked up with a USB cable, which, BTW, does not come with this rather expensive item.I have a 620 Latitude with T2600 @2.16GHz and 4 gigs ram; it's always run hot...clearly all I needed was air space under my computer.Don't waste your bucks."
1,Compaq Evo N610c says DON'T BUY IT,"I feel sad to say this, but I want to prevent you to spend 50 dollars in something not adequate for you.It's possible that it's a good product; but this model of laptop, it's very, very hot.I compared it with others COOLERS: (20, 30 dollars) NOT EXPENSIVE coolers, and it's almost THE SAME.So to get the same results, don't waste more money.Remember, Compaq Evo N610c, TOO HOT."
5,"Zalman Ultra-Quiet Notebook Cooler, Model ZM-NC1000 (Black)",This is a perfect product.Pro:at lower of its speed it's still making cool for my laptop.quiet runningadjustable speeda light on/offbeautiful designflexible usb connectorCon:Nothing at allSum:cheap price that it can't be beat...
4,really the best notebook cooler,hireally i like this zalman notebook cooler...its performance is really good...i am able to keep my notebook heat to minimal using the zalman note book cooler....with respect to performance wise...its the best ..
2,noisy,"I thought it was supposed to ""ultra-quiet"". Yes, it keeps my laptop cool, but the reason I chose it was because of the misleading product title."
4,Pretty good one,Not sure if this one was better then my previous one but i like it. Noise level is very acceptable and the 2nd USB port is very handy
4,"Works well, slightly uncomfortable","I like this cooler--it works well, very quiet, nice angle. My only objection is it is the back is not entirely closed-the top edge sticks out from the top and curls down to your lap, leaving the plastic edge to dig into your legs. Without that, it would be perfect. It's still usable on your lap, but not as comfy as it could be."
5,Best laptop cooler for the money!,"This laptop cooler is probably the best on the market.I have tried other laptop coolers (which also happen to be cheaper) and they simply don't perform very efficiently like the Zalman. What's great about this unit is that it has a variable fan speed that controls both fans. Also, the air that is provided by these fans is evenly distributed throughout the bottom of any laptop (at least more so than those cheap ones with two fans just pushing air into precise locations).I would definitely recommend purchasing this product despite its seemingly high price point, you won't regret it."
5,The Blues will get to ya,"I mean it when I say it the blues will get to ya. The classic songs by Whitey Ford are very sad and I almost found myself crying during ""WATCH ME SHINE."" Whitey Ford has seen the good times and the bad times but if you like rap or a different style of blues you'll love this CD"
2,Not a cookbook,I collect cookbooks and I love maple syrup. I was disappointed because there are 8 recipes in this book including Maple Salmon which constitutes basting the salmon with maple. All the recipes are for the novice cook. I didn't pay enough attention to the reviews and I wish I had.
3,Pretty and ...,"While this book has some very nice photos and a great history of maple syrup and the legends behind it, as far as a comprehensive complete resource on how to make it, it is not. This is a great coffee table book for someone who is into maple syrup not for someone who is learning to make it."
5,Perfect! Very happy with the quality,"Already we have had lots of great use from this item. The figures are large enough to use for visual aids for a large group of children. A nice quiet activity during/after church. Conducive to telling stories and made of nice heavy felt. I will love it for a long time, I'm sure."
3,retro table,"Table arrived on time in damaged package. Dent in table chrome on one side but we decided to keep it. No packing slip in box. No hardware arrived to assemble it. Took several weeks and lots of communication to get it. Seller finally promised tracking number and shipped it UPS. We did not receive a tracking number. Missed one delivery, but UPS delivered the next time and left it at door.A difficult transaction."
5,50's Chrome Plated Round Dining Table,Love the table. Looks as pictured and goes great with my red retro chairs from Target. Well made for the price.
5,retro is great,"the table looks great..easy to put together, looks just like the picture and had a lot of compliments on it, plus laughs as takes us back to the good ole days I would recommend this table"
1,Terrible book!!,"It must be the worst beginning Spanish language book out there. Not well organized, bombards students with complex grammar constructions and useless vocabulary. This textbook is a true nightmare to work with, to say the least. The workbook and audio that accompany the textbook are ridiculously unrelated. In turn, discouraging and confusing students. Tú dirás means 'you will say'...Indeed, I will say,-- Terrible textbook!"
1,Promised CD not with book,I ordered this book with the CD and there is no CD. I needed it for a class so did not have time to send it back. Not happy at all.
4,Pretty Good,"I was surprised because Robert Tine's books usually stick very closly to the movie and therefore are very short and not very deep. THis one however was very good. Lots of details and a bit more engrossing than his usual movie tie-in's. I think he could have dug even deeper, like more attention to the marriage and the friendships. Maybe some background on Salt and Robbie and even the general played by Donald Sutherland. All in all, pretty good though."
5,Everything it promises and more...,"This DVD isn't just about killer endings, it's about creating a killer screenplay, as well. James Mercurio goes through what is needed for any good screenplay, and tells you how to bring everything together at the end to make it all work. He also uses examples from real movies and points out specific scenes where things happen that relate to what he's talking about, then tells you why it works. James Mercurio is also an energetic speaker that's actually interesting to listen to, so you're not falling asleep while taking in all this good info. Definitely worth the buy."
2,Inferior to Legos,"I really wanted to like these, because Legos and other building blocks can be so expensive and we wanted a little variety. These are OK, but some of the pieces are very small, are more specialized than most blocks (and so limit how creative you can be), and the finished product isn't as interesting-looking. But the worst part is the overall quality of the product. The pieces are very, very hard to put together (require much more force than an average kid can produce) and many of them, due to the high pressure, just separate on their own after a while. A couple of them just popped off all by themselves. This happens repeatedly. My sons are both fairly adept at working with these kinds of blocks, but both of them just got frustrated with these, as their project just kept falling apart while they were trying to construct it.There are other alternatives, but this is definitely not close to competing with the quality of Legos and other building blocks."
2,Not a fan!,"Found these worked great for a little while, but were difficult to remove when the nails grew out. Won't use them again."
3,Sizing isn't very accurate,"We bought the jumbo size because it was recommended for dogs who were 70+ lbs, our dog is 80 lbs and the jumbo covers were WAY too big (and we've been told our dog has big feet). Other reviews say size up, in my case I need to size down."
2,Snake Oil,Did absolutely noting but make my wallet lighter. I took it in it's entirety according to daily recommendation and I might as well have been eating M&M's...which taste MUCH better.
2,"Use your library card, rather than purchasing...","...The author had his heart in the right place, but it resembled one long journal entry. I found it hard to read, not so much because of the awkward writing (as one reviewer noted), but because it offered no real insight into our beloved felines. And the author's making such a big deal over his cats enjoying taking hikes with him made me realize the author really isn't a great authority on the nature of cats at all. He was merely 'discovering' cats and was taking the reader along for the somewhat boring ride. It certainly didn't dazzle this reader, as I live with three cats who come with us on vacation trips in our RV and not only do they take regular hikes with us during these excursions, but one of the cats enjoys being on my husband's shoulders while he rides around on his mountain bike.I hesitate recommending that people not read this book, however if you're expecting an insightful tome to grace your bookshelves, I'd suggest you save your money..."
1,Bad advice,"This book should have been subtitled ""How to raise feral cats while annoying your neighbors"". The kindest thing I can say is that the author's cat care advice is irresponsible and would, if followed, result in short, painful lives for many felines. They deserve a more caring advocate."
2,Don't waste your time,"Unfortunately, I did purchase this book as a guide to understanding my cat better. I guess I should have realized it would only help understand the author's cats better. Purely anecdotal accounts, no real expertise or science to his assertions. That may sound like no big deal, but realistically, every cat owner has a cute little story about their cat and an opinion about what they are thinking. So I was hoping this would go beyond his cute little cat stories. Frankly, by the third section, everything he said was running together, as there were no real main points presented. Also, I found it tiring to hear him talk about himself so much. Even his cats don't get full focus in this book, it's mostly him and his swims and walks on the beach. I wanted some depth and got a shallow swim with this one."
4,another perspective,"I thought it was a delightful and informative book and it gives me a much broader perspective on cats and their lives. Certainly it's not a how-to book.But I can relate to a lot of what he writes and have experienced it with my own cats...now I have a clue why they do some things.It's not THE definite book on cats, but then which book can be?When I read all the criticism, it really tells me about the reviewer and not anything about the book."
2,"Many kittens, what about cats?","I found the book irritating over time. At first I was very interested in his story, but it got bland. I was expecting more about the emotional lives of cats and not this guys personal story with his kittens and one cat."
1,Egotistical know-it-all,"Another ""yawn!"" This guy thinks he's an expert because he has five cats? He has no writing skills whatsoever! 1 Star is too much for this book! I have several cats myself and totally disagree with his ""thinking!"""
4,purr-fectly wonderful,"I really loved this book. It reminded me of Clea Simon's sublime ""The Feline Mystique"", which is dog-earred (sorry for the pun) from rereading."
2,Just One Emotional Year Not Enough,"After Masson's When Elephants Weep and Dogs Never Lie About Love, I started with anticipation. What a disappointment.After picking up four 3 month old kittens from various places plus a cat (from a woman with 120 cats) and observing them for one year Masson is a cat expert. He should have stopped when he was ahead."
3,Only good for a quick beach read,"I was expecting a lot more from this book, since it had come highly recommended. But, I thought it was barely worth finishing. She introduced way too many characters too quickly, without fully characterizing any of them. All of the men were the same - attractive and distinguished, blah, blah, blah. Her attempts to create suspense were hollow. Plus, the edition that I read had such bad editing that one of the minor characters had a different last name half way down the page from where she was introduced. Overall, it was a good filler book, but I'm certainly not going to read any more of her work."
4,Another good one,As all the other one this one is another good read . Go out and get all her books today
3,"Loves Music, Loves to Dance","One of her earlier ones, not as good as thr newer ones but still a good novel"
5,A Must-Read!!,"This is my absolute favorite book! It is cleary above and beyond all her others, and contains the usually deeply developed characters, thrilling plot, and surprise ending. I stayed up extremely late and finished it in one night!"
5,"In this book, you trust no one","In the begining, a young girl is mudered. One of her shoes was missing. Several years later the family recives the other shoe in the mail. This twist and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat! The characters quickley come alive.You will feel as if you know evryone, but do you? This book is a real page turner! The end will really surprise you, more than once! This is a must read!"
4,"Loves Music, Loves to DAnce","I thought this book was really compelling and it kept me reading to the end. When reading the book, you kind of get a sense of who might be the killer, but the real killer is suprising at the end. I think Darcy is a true friend to Erin, since she risked her life to find her killer; by dating guys who place personal ads. At the end I am glad that Darcy realizes that the person that she thinks is her friend is really the killer, even though she had no way of escaping death with the killer; but eventually was saved with the help of the police"
4,"Loves Music, Loves to Dance","The novel Loves Music, Loves to Dance was a very well written mystery novel. The characters were developed and I had to keep guessing until the very end of the novel. The man who I thought was the murderer turned out to be innocent and a person I did not suspect turned out to the be real killer. The novel was hard to put down after I started to read it and I wanted to find out what happened next."
3,Very Predictable and Boring,I thought this book was predictable. It also seemed to drone on and on. I almost skipped ahead to the end just to skip the middle.
1,Disappointing read overall,"Unfortunately, although I enjoy a good mystery/suspense novel as much as the next person, this one particular piece was not a good example. Not more than 30 pages in, I could have written the ending myself. I admit I figure out most so-called mysteries and suspense works before the ending comes - not many truly surprising novels out there these days...but this one was of no better caliber than a 'Harlequin Intrigue' insomuch as it shared a similar simplistic style of writing, was painfully predictable and did not have anything approaching solid character development. Overall, a piece of insubstantial fluff best left to newcomers to this genre of fiction who don't wish to be overly challenged."
1,Disliked product,Really thought I was ordering CD's Not cassett tapes. So needless to say I was very disappointed in the product.
4,"Loves Music, Loves to Dance can be deadly","The story Loves Music, Loves to Dance is about two women that are best friends. Erin Kelley and Darcy Scott are both attractive, successful businesswomen. When they agree the help a friend doing a report on personal ads. Erin disappears one night and never returns. There is a serial killer on the lose. he kills the women replaces one of their shoes with a dance slipper. Darcy starts searching for Erin's killer, but little does she know she will be his next victim. She won't have to search much longer."
5,my favorite,"i have read nearly all of mary higgins clark's book and this is my favorite. mary's books may not be in the same class as agatha christie's, but they make for enjoyable reading, with a perfect blend of romance and suspense"
4,"Pete P. 's Review for ""Loves Music Loves to Dance""","Mary Higgins Clark's novel ""Loves Music Loves To Dance"", is an exciting novel that you cannot put down.Darcy Scott is putting together a story that deals with all the different types of people who answer personal ads. Darcy wants to know if the ads really reflect the person. Darcy's best friend Erin answers these ads. During one date, Erin meets a sadistic psycho murderer who has two personalities. He kills Erin. Darcy feels like she should be blamed for Erin's death. Darcy then makes it her mission to find the killer. The novel has you guessing the whole time."
4,Good beach read!,Good beach (or snow day) read! Fast paced and held my interest from page 1 and I could't put it down.
1,Brainless and obvious,"What bugged me about Loves Music, Loves to Dance was how obvious it was who the killer was. Shouldn't there be SOME suspense? Was it just me, or did anyone else notice that this character served no other purpose in the book? All of the other ""suspects"" had motives, half a dozen suspicious occurrences in their pasts, and clues planted to suggest they might have done it. While Mr. Real Killer was just as nice and friendly as can be throughout the whole book. Except for the fact that there was no reason for him to be there except to be the darn killer! Please-- Too obvious!"
2,Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!,"As, with all Mary Higgins Clark books, the reader knows by the third chapter who the murderer is. This is, perhaps, better than some of her others. For real mystery try Dame Agatha Christie or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle!"
2,I'm being generous with the two stars,"This book was awful - I knew who the killer was by the time Igot through a quarter of the book. It was choppy writing andelementary at best. I couldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end. Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off. ew yuck, don't bother.And I'm actually a fan of MHC."
3,Like a lot of MHC books...,"This book has a fabulous beginning and ending, but little in the middle, like a lot of MHC books. However, I think that this book does the aforementioned better than some of the others...Ah...but the whole story line is captivating in itself...and the ending is deliciously spine-chilling...SPOILER...and the fact that A SHRINK is a twisted murderer is really original!This book deserves five stars for the ending and the aforementioned 'fact', but the rest brings it down to three."
5,Truly one of her best novels.,"The protagonist of the novel finds herself caught in a huge dilemna. She soon discovers that her best friend had become the next victim of a psychotic killer who lures his victims through the personal ads. She even decides to place herself in danger in a desperate attempt to seek out the killer and to place an end to his terror. The author is an expert at creating believable and realistic characters and situations, that it will be impossible to put this book down."
4,Cry in the Night!,"I love the song ""Cry in the Night!"" I've seen this CD on the Jenny Jones show, and had to get it. Glad I did. I've heard Vincent James on the radio, and can't wait to hear ""Cry in the Night"" on the air!"
4,Not-so-loud Foo Fightin' music,"The Foo Fighters are a fantastic band. Don't forget that Dave Grohl and company are masters of post-grunge hard rock and power pop rock and roll. Therefore, do not buy this album in hopes to ""rock out."" You should buy this album for two reasons:1. You love the Foo Fighters' music and you cannot get enough.2. You love violins, violas, and other string instruments.If you cannot fulfill reasons 1 and 2, then you should avoid this album. I purchased this album because I knew it would be a great change of pace. I love listening to the Foo Fighters, and I love semi-classical music. Buy it and complete your Foo Fighters collection."
5,"Gripping Vampire tale of Love, Lust and Revenge","These vampires really sizzle!Award winning author Nancy Kilpatrick's fourth novel in the vampire series Power of the Blood packs a wicked punch. Sex, violence and power tear the protagonists apart as they struggle for survival in a world where even the undead can die. The story twists and turns and doesn't let go. Lots of passion here! If you like your vampires sexy and theatrical, you'll love this book!"
3,The book is good but don't count on support from e-Zone,"I purchased this book because of the continuing education units that I could get and because of the support features of the web-based learning offered by e-zone. You do not get any support from e-zone. There are many errors in the book and the CD was incomplete. They say there is an installation chapter in the book to guide you in setting up the software. There is no such chapter. The CD is missing files and you have to go to e-zone to get the fix, but it still doesn't include all the files that you need.The book is good, but this is really a self-study book. You can't even e-mail e-zone and get a response from them."
2,I've seen better,"A better title would have been ""HTML 4 A Self- Study Guide"". The primary reson I chose this manual was for the online, interactive assistance. After trying the URL given in the book, and attempting to e-mail the publisher several times, without success, I finally used it as a self study guide. As such, it was adequate. If you're looking for a good tutorial, I'm sure you can find better, at a lower cost."
2,Excellent latin rhythms... but the lyrics with no sense!,"Paulina Rubio made an effort.I don't know what is she trying to do, with mixing all this types of music, with such lyrics so fool. Nothing to deserve. The music, is terrific, the rhythms as well, this is an excellent record to have for a dance club.Paulina is trying to do, the things that she had never done. Get involved in other rhythms, but in one record! her formula is good. But lyrics for a latin singer are important. Whatever, she has written some songs for this CD, and... they're the worst!Watching up the steps of Thalia, with the double of millions sold around the world, Thalia get involved into so much music rhythms in her all career, demonstrating that she don't have to put 'em all into a one record. Buy this CD of Pau-Latina, is good, but please don't pay attention to the lyrics, are poor, with no sense, shame on Paulina.This songs will blow your mind some several weeks. Are tasty, that's why are so popular."
1,Time to Listen Other Latin Singers Like THALIA,"Please DO NOT throw your money away buying this CD. Its horible, there is nothing good about listening.I wish I could return this item and get my money back.Although she is from Mexico, I can assure you no one likes her over here!!!Paulina Rubio, I think it's time for you to retire!It's time to listen THALIA"
1,Horrible!,"Paulina Rubio's 2000 self-titled album was actually good, even though I really don't like Rubio's voice. I borrowed this CD from a friend, thinking it was also going to be good. Her English album was a failure, but I don't think this will be any better. All the songs in this album are so immature. The lyrics are stupid and the music sounds horrible. Is this some kind of regional Mexican music mixed with reggae, or what? It's just horrible. I don't event want to waste my time talking about the songs. I only have one thing to say about them. They stink!Her only good album out there is ""Paulina"". Her voice is horrible and she has no talent. I honestly don't think she's going to make it with this album. Please, don't but this trash! My friend regretted buying this CD. Don't commit the same mistake."
1,Bubble gum,"This is bubble gum music. And, by the way, Thalia is bubble gum too. Both of them are in business because of their looks."
1,pau latina,paulina rubio is by afar the worst latin musician i have ever encountered. her singing is off key in many if not all songs and she mixes songs that should not be mixed. someone please tell paulina that she should stop recording and try soemthing else cause here in america she didnt do as well as some would hope in fact were looking forward to shakira going english not all of mexico's artists.
1,AUGH YUK! THAT VOICE!,"Playing her on the radio is a crime!...there are some people like ECHEVERRI or JULIETA VENEGAS even BELINDA sing better than this pretend to be a MADONNA artist, her songs are pure copies of another songs, ALGO TIENES pau pau pau?...humm.. someone has an inflated ego, TE QUISE TANTO just another BUKIS song!, PERROS okay Miss Rubio you are not reggateon queen give it up, you sound fake!, DAME OTRO TEQUILA, another squeeky independent woman anthem, so over over used, you should stop recording, cos my ears hurt."
1,Stop paulina STOP!,this woman cannot sing...this woman should just simply STOP!the music...the words...it's all meaningless.Pau does not rock!
5,"Love, Love, pau pau","This is a great pop album. Every track is amazing. Dame otro Tequila & ojala are my favorites. I highly recommend this album. Its been out for a while & I still play it especially on firday nights to get me pumped up for the weekend. For those who have negative comments about this album, you just can't stand the fact that paulina is extremly sucessful & sells out thalia"
1,Pau-Latina is a huge letdown.,I sampled this cd online at univision.com and was surprised at how bad it was. I was disappointed with her English debut and was expecting an improvement on this one but the music and the lyrics are terrible! Her voice has gone downhill as well. She should stick to latin bubble gum and leave the latin rhythms to better qualified musicians.
1,Hoy me arrepiento!!,"Compré ese disco pensando que las canciones serian buenas como lo es ""Te Quise Tanto"", pero me engañé! Todas las otras canciones son malísimas!Es un disco infantil, para niños de 3 años!Una porqueria!Esa tipa no canta, no tiene voz, tampoco talento...""pobre niña pobre""!Mejor que compren el nuevo disco de Norah Jones o Thalia."
1,Just A Trash.Only has 1 Hit Song,"I only liked Te Quise Tanto.This album is not good as old Paulina albums.She is falling down.With one hit song,she can not be successful with this kind of an album.Do not buy this album.You can download only Te Quise Tanto from internet in mp3 version.I will sell my PauLatina album very soon.I prefer buying Thalia's new Greatest Hits album.She is talented than Paulina Rubio at least the fact is Paulina Rubio went to destory Thalia's promotional night of Thalia's Greatest Hits album.Now its up to you.I will always give 1 star to this trash album"
4,Latin Pop Princess,"In my opinion pailina rubio is the hottest most talented latin singer out there right now. her music is very inspiring and is heard almost everywhere she is a club, favorite and will always fimd people singing when you herar her music playing. the top song i believe are ""dame otro tequila"" ""ago tienes"" ""te quise tanto""."
5,Energy and Growth,"PAULATINA, in contrast with her previous material, is a set of triumphant experimentation and endless dedication that delivers music, spirit and rithym. ""Algo Tienes"" and ""Te Quise Tanto"" along with ""Perros"" is exactly the kind of music that has defined Paulina as the Queen op Pop since her hit album ""Paulina"". With a mixture of pop, folkhore and hip pop, Paulatina delivers the energy that millions of fans have learned to indentify Paulina Rubio with.Fearless in the mixture of sounds and rythyms. Playful and Energetic. Sweet ballads and inspiring lyrics that make you want to hear this over and over again.No song in this new album can go unheard. Paulatina is without a doubt one of Rubio's greatest accomplisments since her debut as a solist artist. An absolut reflection fo Paulina's Energy and Growth."
4,3rd Best Album,"Pau-Latina is a great cd. If you already own the cd Paulina and the cd Border Girl I say buy it Now!!!!!!! If you do not have them than I would suggest buying them first and then buy Pau-Latina. Overall Pau-latina deserves 4 stars.(Mostly for the songs Te Quise Tanto,Peros,My Friend Mi Amigo,and Dame otra Tequila)"
1,Worst singer ever!,"Horrible! This woman can't sing. Don't waste your money , and if you don't believe me just listen to her trying to sing 'pretty woman' (youtube).. its embarassing."
1,guacala,"guacala. the mixtures of rhythms are good but her voice is not. her voice lacks range and distinction. Do not buy this cd, only sample it if you get a chance, but definitely a garbage album.... A better buy is her old spanish productions."
5,bien por Pau,"pAU ESTA EN EL NUMERO #1 EN TODOS LADOS ESTE DISCO ES DE LOS MEJORES EN LA HISTORIA DEL POP EN ESPAÑOL.PAU CANTA MEJOR QUE NUNCA, INCREIBLE CDCOMPRALO YAAAAAAAAAA"
5,She's amazing.,"I heard Paulina for the first time 3 years ago in Italy. They were playing frequently ""Lo hare por ti"", I liked the song very much and bought the album and I found it intresting. Then I heard her music again in France when her ""The one you love"" single came out and bought ""Border Girl"". I was lucky to see her live when she sang with Enrique Iglesias and she simply rocked.So finally an american friend came to visit me some days ago and brought some new cd's including ""Paulatina"" and I think that this one is her best cd so far. So now I'm here in Amazon ready to order it because I went to Fnac and it's on pre-order.So people really trust me this is a very good singer. maybe her voice is not as Christina's but she sings very good. She's full of energy."
5,PAULINA STILL #1 ON THE CHARTS,"Wow, what can I say! I enjoyed listening to this cd as soon as I got it. I listen to it when I work out. Pau's songs have not only a certain rhythm in them for her fans to enjoy but there's always a story behind every great song & rhythm. I really love how she came up with new styles (spanish, batucada, hiphop, rancheras etc)and variations in her music. The CD in my oppinion is very SEXY & ENERGETIC. Everyone will have their personal favorites from this album... mine are ""Perros"" and ""Adiosito Corazon."" Paulina...Keep up the great work mujer!from a fan of yours (since the Timbiriche years)"
3,much better than bordergirl,"I think this cd was trying to get back to the success of Paulina, her amazing pop cd of a few years back. I think Paulina tries to hard this time. There are a few good pop tunes, but the rapping is really awful.Some of her lyrics are questionable also. Talking about perros, tequila, my friend, mi amigo.. for me was a little lame!The ballads at the end are also boring. I think Paulina's last pop cd entierly in Spanish was a top hit. Almost every track likeable. I think this cd is though much better than bordergirl.Te quise tanto is a lot of fun and the first song also. What's the with the instrumental at the end?"
1,QUE ES ESTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"No puedo creer que esta chava piense que cante yo entiendo que necesite ganarse la vida pero que lo haga en otra cosa y deje que personas que si tienen talento tengan la oportunidad que ella tiene, la verdad no te recomiendo este disco es un fracaso quiza quiera vender lo que con su pasado dizque en ingles no obtuvo gracias a dios no lo compre pues alguien que conozco por desgracia lo hizo pero lo regalo por que tambien no le gusto, espero que la publicidad que le hacen le ayude pero no conmigo y deseo que contigo tampoco que quiza quieras comprarlo."
1,LO PEOR DE LA MUSICA!,UNA BASURA!! LA VERGUENZA DE LA MUSICA LATINA Y DE LOS MEXICANOS.NO COMPREN EL DISCO...ES HORIBLE!!
1,NO GOOD,"don't waste your money!! I knew Paulina would not be able to top her Paulina 2000 album and here she proves that she couldn't. This is a horrible rendition of what she considers ""latin"" music. That throaty voice in some of her tracks makes this a very hard to listen to album. Save the money....DONATE IT TO CHARITY INSTEAD!!"
1,DON'T LIKE IT !,"I THOUGHT THE ALBUM WOULD BE BETTER.HER FIRST SINGLE ""TE QUIZE TANTO"" IS CATCHY BUT THE ALBUM LACKS IN MUSICAL STRENGTH. PAULINA DOES NOT HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VOICE..THEREFORE SHE SHOULD TRY DIFFERENT SINGING TECHNIQUES..."
1,A total shame for latin music!,"Paulina Rubio is one of the worst latin singers that have ever lived. It's such a shame for Latinos to be represented by this girl that doesn't even know what she sings. Although she has a lot of fans all over the world, she is still the worst singer ever!"
1,buyer beware,"please if you dont want to waist your money dont buy this cd its is garbage her voice does not sound good, and the songs are bad i was looking foward for this cd but i have to return it i will not waist my money on garbage i dont see why you should"
1,Total Fraud,"I've heard form a reliable source, namely a recording engineer for one of her albums, that this girl doesn't quite sing at all, in fact you can actually notice the voice being of key in some of the songs, and all of the vocals are autotuned manually, She is another built product for the trash consuming public. I wouldn't recomend this to any respected music lover and neither should you."
1,que estaba pensando su disquera cuando la contrataron?!!!!!!,"esta tipa canta peor que una cabra en la lluvia con laringitis. todo el mundo canta mejor que paulina. su disco es ofensivamente malo y barato, es un desperdicio de plastico y una gran contaminacion ambiental. yo quiero mi dinero de vuelta!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,FALTA DE ORIGINALIDAD,"La verdad este disco cuando lo oi me desilusiono pues como siempre paulina siempre quiere copiarle a todo mundo y mas que nada a las garandes divas como MADONNA Y THALIA ella carece de originalidad y algunas de sus canciones si debo reconocer que hay buena musica pero en cuanto a voz este disco carece bastante,si lo piensas comp[rar es bajo tu propio riesgo mejor espera a que alguien se gaste su dinero en este y luego te lo preste para que tu decidas."
1,NO ENTIENDO COMO PUEDE HABER GENTE QUE LE GUSTE ESTO.,"este disco es HORRIBLE y OFENSIVO!!!!!!!! ella como cantante es un fracaso, CARECE TOTALMENTE de talento, su voz es UN DESASTRE y nisiquiera sabe bailar. Sus letras son DESABRIDAS Y GASTADAS. en fin, este disco es una tremenda PORQUERIA!!!!! NO VALE UN SOLO CENTAVO.ella es famosa por que sabe hacer buenos escandalos, quitarse la ropa y regar chismes baratos, y como prueba esta el escandalito que armo al aparecerse en la presentacion de la mediocre de thalia para llamar la atencion. En fin, cantantes como paulina se olvidan rapidamente."
1,AWFUL CD,"Paulina Rubio is yet another singer who appeals to teens and others with her boring dance beat, and simplistic lyrics. There is no heart, no passion in her. If you want beauty in music try Thalia's ""Rosalinda"" or ""Entre el Mar y una Estrella"" most material by Shakira, ANYTHING by Selena or country music. I will say this CD is better than ""Border Girl"", which is one of the worst CDs ever made (Thalia in English is not good either). Paulina is exactly like Brittney, Christina, JLO, Mandy Moore, and others who who cater to the lowest common denominator, the only difference is she does it en espanol. Let me say this while I prefer Thalia (And there is NO comparison, THALIA is on the level of Elvis or the Beatles compared to Paulina), if you really want to LISTEN to musica en espanol with intelligence try Selena. Simply put if you are an adult, avoid this singer like the plague."
1,"BAD,BAD,BAD","Malo,malo,malo no puedo creer que es esto lo unico bueno que puedo decir de este cd, es la musica claro con buena produccion y colaborades expertos en la musica hasta yo soy el mejor cantante del mundo solo voy a ser breve la verdad no gastes tu dinero en esto es lo unico que puedo decir o compralo junto con unas aspirinas porque al oirlo te puede dar dolor de cabeza asi es que tu dices."
1,Why was this book written?,"This text is not up-to-date with the latest developments in SPM techniques, even though it has a fairly recent copyright. The material that is covered is poorly organized. The author fails to develop a discussion on one technique before moving into another. I'm not sure why the author felt the need to write this book, as it generally doesn't provide any current or complete discussion of any modern SPM methods."
5,Great product,Great productVery prompt shippingYou need to lock on the talk switch all the time to use this handsetThen you press the talk button on the handsetWill purchase again
3,Liked Baby Play better,"It had a few interesting ideas, my baby is 1 and we've only done the activities for his age. But overall this book is smaller than the previous book (Baby Play) and the ideas seem less creative and fun than the ones in the first book."
3,Some fun,"Some of the activities are fun, others just a new spin on the same games. Might best for new moms like me who lack creativity."
5,My husband just loves these books,"These are great books for first time parents and dads. (Moms, you probably do most of these things with your baby by instinct). But I love them (we have toddler play and baby play) because it give me clear ideas as to how to play with my daughter on those days when I feel like I just don't have a clue. My husband thinks it is fun to pick a new activity each weekend to try with our daughter--it has really helped them to bond."
5,Must have for new parents!,"We bought this book when our oldest was two years old and now we are still using it to keep his 18 month old brother busy. Lots of cute activities, songs and games. Most require no supplies and the ones that do usually require things that can be found around the home."
3,Not really for toddlers,"The book is geared more to babies or maybe very young toddlers, the specialty of Gymboree. It's a little to la-di-da for toddlers if you ask me."
1,Not worth buying,"Most of these activities are common sense like other reviewers have mentioned. The ones that are more innovative unfortunately only occupy a toddlers attention for five minutes. I was looking for activities that would occupy us for 15-30 minutes or more. The toddler busy book has those. I have to also mention many activities were just not appealing to me. I would suggest borrowing it from your library.Oh and one last thing, if you attend Gymboree then you will see many items from the classes."
5,Toddler Play,"This is a great book, it gives us great ideas on how to develop our child's creativity."
3,Good Concept,This is a pretty good book. Most of the items in here are things you would have already thought of...or are already doing and it just tells you why it is important for the kiddos.
2,for those that have very little immagination,"Sorry, but I didn't think this book was all that great. I guess I can trust my own immagination for activities to keep my little one happy."
2,Too cutesy for toddlers--more like entertain your baby book,"I got this book hoping I could find a way to entertain my toddler without having to be ""involved"" in the entertainment--you know let her play on her own in the same room while I study or use the computer. Well, this book is more of a caregiver involvement book and I wish I had not spent the small amount that I paid for it. This book is too cutesy for a toddler--it has sing along type songs that are more for babies than toddlers. Anyway, I would only recommend it for one year and under. I would appreciate anyone giving me a recommend for book for toddlers that I am looking for. Thanks."
2,Not as described!,This book was supposed to be in good condition. The cover was bent in many spots and there were pen marks on the cover and some of the pages.
4,A MUST HAVE FOR FIRST TIME MOTHER,"This book is very informative for a first time mother who run out of idea of what to play with her baby !It shows you different games according to your child's age with colorful picture demonstration. It also introduce different type of games for different stimulation. Very creative and simple. It won't require you to buy expensive acessories. It teaches you to turn a simple cup to a wonderful, educational, stimulative toy.I just love it!"
3,not the best toddler activity book,"We liked this book, but found it overrated. There are some good ideas and it has a very high gloss, professional format. However, it is by far not the best activity book for toddlers and has some overly obvious information and activities, which most parents initiate instinctively with their children and without the help of a book. The Toddlers Busy Book, for example, has given us a much better range of ideas."
5,Fun ideas,"This book has terrific fun ideas for toddlers. It has many of the rhymes and songs that every child (and parent!) should know. We consider ourselves remedial parents and found this book to be quite helpful! Now we're WOWWING other parents with our rendition of ""The Noble Duke of York."""
3,Just ok...,"This book was alright, but a lot of the ideas were sort of no brainers. There were a few new things that I never thought about, but a lot of it is stuff that is in magazines, books and things that are just basic common sense. The pictures in the book are of fabulous quality and there are some great songs and fingerplays in the book."
3,It's ok...,"I bought the Baby Play book and really liked it a lot. However, I was a little disappointed with this one. It has some of the same information as the Baby Play. It does had some nursery rhymes and children's songs which can be pretty useful."
4,Just as good as I expected,"Patricia Wrede is so creative. I love her stories, always a touch whimsical and tongue in cheek. Several of these also showed a very slightly darker side, more Brothers Grimm-esque, while still being child appropriate."
5,great book,"I found the first enchanted forest chronicle book in a thrift shop and fell in love with the series. This book is a collection of short stories that goes with the series, if you love the rest of the series this is a must have"
5,"Indeed, not just for kids","I'm only up to page 95, but this collection deserves 5 stars just by containing ""Earthwitch."" In its 25 pages, Wrede rivals the best grand opera."
5,Wonderful collection of stories by Wrede!!,"I loved this book! The stories are all really good. If you want to read some of Wrede's writing this is an excellent example of what she can do! Some of the stories aren't quite as good as others, but it is a book worth reading just the same. One of thae many reasons that this is a good book is that it has a bunch of different stories. They are all good and are all nicely concluded. I really recommend this book to everyone."
3,Good read...if you like short stories,"I did enjoy the stories quite a bit, especially Roses by Midnight. They are all good stories, all very clearly written.My only dilemma was that I have read the entire 4 part series of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Ms. Wrede and with 4 books telling one story, I was left feeling a bit lacking when 1 book contained 10 stories. Felt like there could be much more to the story that was left out, almost like reading a book and watching the movie. Even if you loved the movie, you still know the book had more depth and detail.The book ended with an story that tied in to the Enchanted Forest Chronicles and that was a pleasant climax, and it is a good read for any C. Wrede fan, but dont expect to find an incredible literary treasure in this book.Though the idea of her extending a few of the stories would be marvelous."
3,The type of techno that IS techno,"The music on this album is unique, with futuristic sounds, and good beat rythm techno. And in other times, wierd. The only disappointing part of this album is the lack of change in the music. This album would be good for playing games(in other words, listening to the album while playing a fast-energetic game). The track that hit my emotions the most was Invisible Force."
5,Could not be any easier !,"I bought this car seat for my 7 month old baby after I noticed that he seemed very uncomfortable in his small infant seat. I went to the store and had him sit in a couple of the car seats. When he sat in this one he looked incredibly comfortable. The price is very affordable as well. And the one thing I was worried about was not a problem at all. It was incredibly easy to install. I was also worried about how it would fit in a small car, considering both my husband and I have small cars. And to my surprise it fit very well. I would honestly recommend this seat to everyone, especially those who want their child to feel comfortable."
4,"Great, especially for price!","We purchased this seat for our 6 month old daughter because she had outgrown her infant carrier. We intially looked at it because was a Consumer Reports ""Best Buy"". We have been very pleased with the seat. It has extra cushioning on the bottom and a little head pillow for the back of their head even, all which is washable also!"
3,Tricky but Good,We bought this seat for our son when he was 7 months old. It took me quite a while to figure out how to install it properly with out it being way too loose. Finally after going to Babies R Us and having the employee recommend a device called a TIGHT RIDE (or a MIGHTY TITE) it stays well put. The device was an extra $10 but well worth it. My son enjoys the comfortable seat and seems very secure. Thanks!
3,Trouble with harness,"We bought this for our 8 month old daughter. She is light in weight for her age but was too tall for her infant seat. This seat is fairly good but we do have trouble getting the harness to tighten snuggly around her chest without several attempts each time we put her in it. Not sure if it is due to her smaller size but I would recommend testing it out before buying it. However, it is a good seat for the price."
4,Love it,"We bought this car seat because our 4 month old son had outgrown his infant carrier. I read reviews on several car seats and checked out the safety ratings. This one is the best by far. It was rated better than Britax in crash protection and was HALF THE PRICE. We have no problems with the straps and I find them easy to adjust and use. The only difficulty I ran into was actually getting the car seat installed because my vehicle doesn't have the latch system, this is where husbands come in handy! Also, it fits in smaller back seats. We have a Quad Cab Dodge Ram 1500 and it fits perfectly. I would recommend this car seat to anyone."
4,An excellent buy and a solid product,"We bought this carseat for our daughter who had just outgrown her infant seat. We have a small car (a Saturn) and were concerned about the size of a convertible carseat but this seat fits just fine in our car. It wipes clean fairly easily (although, because the fabric is dark you have to give it a pretty good scrubbing to get formula out of it), it's easier to get our daughter out of than her infant seat was and it seems secure. The only thing we don't care for is that the latch across her chest is sometimes hard to buckle and unbuckle."
3,"Juice glasses, Not rocks","These are beautiful glasses and I kept 1 set but returned the other. They are just too small. Maybe I mix really large cocktails, but these are the smallest ""rocks""glasses I've ever seen, more like juice or stemless wine glasses. I also purchased the larger ones and they are what I would call ""rocks"" glasses.Again, beautiful nice and heavy so they shouldn't break easily and have a nice weight in your hand."
4,beautiful but small,I received these as a gift for Christmas. I had 2 sizes on my wish list. One was smaller than the other. They bought both sizes and the larger set is great. The smaller set will probably be used as shot glasses or something similar. They are very small. The color is beautiful and matches my kitchen very well. I have cobalt accents. LOVE the larger size!!
5,Very nice glasses,"My fiancé and I bought these for my Dad for Christmas (along with a bottle of his favorite, Bombay Sapphire Gin). From my childhood I had remembered him having some fancy glasses for his gin that had some blue glass in them, but never knew what happened to them. I decided to bring that back into his life and these glasses seemed even better than the ones I remembered. They arrived safely and look very nice in person. I will say that I don't really know what the description ""gift boxed"" means, except maybe that they came in a cardboard box describing the product as just about everything does. I kind of expected something more decorative and gift-ready. Clearly this isn't a serious issue and I wasn't about to dock a star for it, just wanted to mention it for anyone else who may expect something different. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase and might go over to my parents house just to try them out for myself."
4,Quite good & make a very decent gift,These look great & are highly functional. The courier came a bit late than expected(9-10 days).. Anyhow the friends couple really liked my gift & I quite recommend it.
5,Buy these now!,I bought a set of these and the beverage sized glasses together. They far exceeded my expectations. If I find wine glasses and tumblers in this pattern I will buy them in a heartbeat.
5,Beautiful glasses,"I recieved these glasses today and they are gorgeous! They feel very sturdy, so even with 3 kids I think they will hold up okay. They are also dish-washer safe which is a plus. I love the variations in the glass shape and color. They are very unique and look forward to using them."
2,"Mediocre, At Best","Those of us who love doo-wop can site many reasons for our affection, but surely at the top of the list is the wonderful harmonies that characterize the genre. The mediocre harmonies on most of the tracks of this CD are painful to listen to. Add to that the weak arrangements and the uninspiring lyrics for most of the songs, and you end up wondering why you spent so much time seeking out this collection. There is only one standout here, and that is ""Night Owl,"" a hard to find cut that doesn't seem to be available anywhere other than on this CD."
1,"For the Love of God, Avoid this Steaming Load",This book is among the worst books I have ever read. Two sides compete for the soul of Harry Dancer. There is no explanation as to why Harry is worth competing over. The characters fighting to bring Harry to one side or the other are never developed into anything that would even mildly interest a reader.I was stuck in a waiting room for two days and read this because the alternative was three week old newspapers. I did not choose wisely.I see used copies are available for a penny. You are at risk of overpaying. The book really sucks plain and simple.
5,Happy Fun,This game is fun and will make you happy. It's adorable characters give this game a very upbeat feel. This is the perfect game to play if you want to be entertained in a happy and relaxing way. You don't feel yourself getting tense as you do with some of the other (fighting/shooting) games.
5,ADDICTED TO THIS GAME!!!,Love this game! Challenging yet really fun/funny! I am sure that the people who made this game had as much fun as i am playing it! I definitely hope they make more!!!
1,.........wow.................,i bought this game and played it for like 10 min then burned it.its pointless and a waste of money.all you do is role around and do nothin.i was dissapointed after seeing all these good reveiws
2,Smells wonderful - but...,"Smells wonderful - but....This 3-in1 product leaves my hair too soft, limp. And it leaves my face with an all-over slight itch soon after use."
3,Great for skin...,"not so much for hair. After I used it as a shampoo, my hair didn't feel clean. It felt a bit like the product didn't rinse out completely, even though I rinsed thoroughly. My skin liked it, though, and the scent in the shower was the pure grace that I know and love. It must be hard to make a product that's a shampoo AND shower gel. I'll use what I have, but will I buy it again? Jury is still out..."
2,Fragrance does not last,The fragrance is not worth the extra money difference from their other shampoo/bath products. It does not last. All of their scents seem to last just while you are using them.
2,"Okay, what's the hype?","I just wanted to see what the HYPE was about. Okay,I am still waiting to see it, or should I say ""smell""it. I am not impressed. Seems like expensive soap.I even think that IVORY soap has more of a scent....I will use it and never order this soap again.However... it does not dry out the skin that much, so if you have dry skin, this may be the product for you.OK I wrote this review a few months ago.It is now September and I justfinished the bottle.I still believe that if you have dry skin, this is the body wash for you. I may purchase this product again when I have moneyto just splurge...I still say it is a ""clean sent""...like ivory."
1,Serious omissions,"As a ""look inside"", at the index will show, there is no discussion of the core Buddhist 'doctrines' of ""no-self"" (no permanent fixed separate self) , impermanence , or of shunyata or emptiness , and as a result critical subtle distinctions between pain and suffering are not made. The nature of craving is also misunderstood, as a result. A web search for Daniel Ingram, or Shinzen will provide very detailed free information as to how Buddhist teachings work with meditation practice to produce positive changes. Ayya Khema's writings also provide a very accessible introduction, without the biases of western therapy interfering. Khema and Shinzen are also on ""Utube"". A search for acesstoinsight , dharmaseed , & audiodharma will also be productive."
3,Not What Buddha Taught,"I read half of both of David Brazier's books. I actually thought that they were really good and both went along with my own beliefs, beliefs that I formed while in Buddhism when I didn't agree with what I was hearing. But after studying Buddhism for some time and leaving because I couldn't accept certain teachings, teachings that Brazier himself has changed for the better due being much more loving and compassionate, I could not accept that Brazier's views were that of Buddha. He offers little proof other than his own common sense, which common sense I admire. I only wish his teachings were the Buddha's."
5,Packed with useful information,"This book is probably the best which I have read on its level. Packed with useful information, organized, and containing many clever examples and some humor as well. Most importantly, Professors Brown and Attardo provide many differnt viewpoints of linguistics concerning theory, rather than some of the one-sided books I have read. This is a must read for anyone wishing to jump into linguistics."
5,I can't believe I got this for so cheap!,I had heard of Sam Cooke before but I knew nothing about this group. I listened to the samples and was just blown away by these so perfectly named brothers that I just had to have it.
4,Lives and Philosophy of Cats and animal companions,"In the Cats of Thistle Hill, Roger Caras writes astory that is like reading about the peaceful environment of Ann of Green Gables on Prince Edward Island, animal version. Besides feeling the peaceable nature of Thistle Hill and its environment, you read about the lives of different cats living at Thistle Hill, their personalities, and finally if you have ever thought about the philosophy of cats, you will have that conversation with Roger Caras in this book. Especially, note Teddy, a scarred cat rescued from the streets of San Francisco, who won't have anything to do with other animals until he discovers Emmy. Teddy goes on to become a single parent father of three kittens whom he mothers, protects and loves Teddy's story not only is an interesting true story, but it makes the point that animals have feelings. There are other equally beautiful stories of cats, a llama, dogs, a burro etc. in this book."
5,Wonderful Whimsy,"I read this book with a 5-year old starting school. George's story is very accessible, and the details of his life are so wonderfully and creatively silly, that both adult and child were sincerely giggling at every page. Chad Cameron's illustrations are artful and fanciful -- he has a profound visual sense of humor. This book would be wonderful for any kid, and especially those working through an adjustment to a new school (or home?) situation."
1,No real Dave and no real story!,"While our son loves the ""There Goes"" series, the dump truck video lacks the sophistication, fun and lively banter of some of the others in the series. The new Dave is a bore, while Dave Hood (the original) exudes enthusiasm. Our advice: avoid this one, and stick with the Truck, Train or Police Car videos in this series."
3,"Where's The ""Real"" Dopey Dave?","My 24 month old son owns most of the videos in this series, and this was the first time he asked to switch (to There Goes a Fire Truck) halfway through. The new Dave doesn't stack up."
5,My great grandson loved this years ago.,I got this for Ethan years ago as a Christmas gift and he loved it. Now he's playing games on his Wii.
1,"where in the world is the original "" dave ""?","well, we have all the there goes... series and i bought the farm tractor one and thought it was terrible. the actor portraying dave is terrible. he has no sence of humor, and is like a robot. my kids don't enjoy this one and never ask to see it. their favorites are there goes a monster truck, and there goes a spaceship. we would like to see the original dave back or you've lost a customer for good. DAVE HOOD, DAVE HOOD!!!!!! Does anyone know what happened to him? thank you,"
4,"Son's first ""there goes..."" video","My son can't get enough of this video, though he still calls the trucks, ""cars"". Lots of action of vehicles and descriptions. Did not care much for the shot with Dave sleeping on a rockpile and a front-loader with a full bucket of rocks dropping it near him. Planning on purchasing another of these videos..."
2,"""Where's the Old Dave?"", my son asked","This tape is missing the polish and professional feel of the previous tapes in the There goes a ... series. This is especially true of the new actor playing Dave, the bumbling star of the series, who was played previously by Dave Hood. My son enjoyed the video but misses the old Dave."
2,what happened to Dave?,"My 3-year-old doesn't ask much for this one! If your son is crazy about machines (like mine is), get ""There goes a bulldozer"", a much better buy. The new Dave is unbearably obnoxious (and I thought the old Dave was bad!), definitely IQ impaired. The dump trucks are awesome, but the script and gags are awful! My son has never found it funny, and he laughed even after the hundredth viewing of ""There goes a bulldozer"". Save your money on this one."
4,Good purchase,"Hard to believe but in the entire video there are only 3 (maybe 4) shots of dump trucks dumping their load. But there are good shots of trucks rolling.I like this new ""Dave"" guy. He's funny. However, he does go off on a tagent about how asphalt is made, which instantly drops my 2 year old's attention.I'd buy this one again."
3,"Very very basic in 21Days, Nah!!!","A very basic book. If you are looking for OOP or database programming basics, this is certainly not a book for you. But if you are a casual user who just wants to see partial capabilities of vb, go with this book. I guess if this book is used in schools as a requirement, it should be for ""Intro to VB"" and not for even VB-I."
1,teach yourself visual basic 6 ? ---I THINK NOT,"I must say, this book sucked. Chapter 2 to chapter 5 is somewhat useful, but this is in no way for beginners. The writer assumes that the reader is familiar with visual basic terms and uses them extensively in this book, which of course just confuses the reader. And what bothered me more is the book doesn't really talk about the programming aspect, it concentrates more on how visual basic itself works. There were couple of examples (which if you are a beginner will stare at it as if it is written in a different language, even at the explanation part). I guess I am so furious, because this book wasted 30 days of my time and where I learned little to nothing, and almost (yes, ALMOST) made me feel like ending any programming desire I had. But Luckily I picked up few other beginners book for visual basic 6, and finally realized it is not as hard as this book made it seem like it is. So my advice is, don't waste your money, effort and time on this."
2,Wrong taste,I really like ramen and wanted to eat some that was a little healthier so I gave these a try. To me these tasted to much like cabbage and I'm not a cabbage fan. Didn't taste like chicken at all. The taste spoiled it for me.
2,Yuck,"I LOVE the chicken pilaf and tortilla soup by Dr. McDougall, but this ""ramen"" is horrible. The noodles are so mushy. There is nothing ramen about this soup. It tastes like mushy cardboard. I have put worse things in my mouth, so I'm giving this 2 stars. It is still pretty disgusting though. Take this one out of your line of products, Dr. McDougall. Did you taste it before you approved it? In a weird way, it is so bad that it makes me rethink my love of the pilaf and torilla soup."
1,expected better,"I'm with the other bad review, the flavor is just not good. Good ingredients or not, flavor sucked."
1,Ramen noodles,I also wanted to like this item. I love Ramen noodles - but this had a weird after taste. Did not like it.
1,Sent wrong product.,I do not hate the product. This is the problem. The company sent me a substitute for rice wine. Instead they sent me Marukan rice vinegar. There is a huge difference between rice vinegar and sweet rice wine. They are used for entirely different recipes. . Can this company be trusted to send the right product.>???????
4,Good product at a good price,"It's hard to give a product as generic as this five stars, but the quality has been consistent over multiple orders, it is always as described, the price is good, and it is delivered quickly!"
5,Phenomenal,"I got this CD during the past year and it has quickly dominated airplay time on my cd player and ipod!!! Each song creeps up on you and brings deeper and deeper appreciation as you become familiar with it. Now if I order enchiladas, I make sure to order a Guacamole Salad instead of just guacamole! L.A. Lights is an incredibly upbeat song until you read the lyrics and discover the insanity and irony of the whole song, what venting! Clearly Lovett is a clever and brilliant songwriter and I enjoy this disc immensely. Previously I had got into his albums that came out in college like Road to Ensada and the one with Church on it. This CD really packs a punch as each track is a winner, whereas the others mentioned are hot and cold."
1,Repackaged old stuff,I love Lyle but I am tired of the same old stuff. I have every one of his Cds except the first one and this new disk only has a couple of new songs. I have seen him live five times since he last turned out an original disk. Sure Step Inside This House was good but it wasn't HIS writing. What has he been doing with himself? Maybe he should quit riding motorcycles with Lance Armstrong and start writing music. When he did it was brilliant. If he doesn't come out with something soon he should wait until 2006 and make it an even ten years since his last original recording.
3,Lyle Lovett,"This would have to be one of lyle's better albums. As my partner is the Lyle Lovett fan not me, i didn't mind this album. He has some really nice songs on this album. I Have listened to it a few times. it kinda grows on ya."
4,Some of Lyle Lovett's best....definitely good bang for the $,"This is good stuff if you want Lovett's A side singles. For the price, it's a good buy and a good variety of Lovett's music. Well recorded and worth the $$$."
5,great compilation,"A great place to start for those just checking out LL for the first time. This cd compiles LL's more countrified songs from his first three albums and adds two additional songs (the one receiving air play being 'san antonio girl').I bought this even though I already have albums 2 and 3, but not his 1st and it is a great mixing of the songs creating a fluid whole. Typical trademark LL countrified, Texas songs with slyly humorous lyrics, beautiful music expertly played, excellent production, makes for a great compilation. If you like this, you'll want to go next to 'The Road to Ensenada', in my opinion, his best to date."
5,Extremely Pleased,"Ten inches of aperture, portability, ease of use, high quality construction, and a great price are what attracted me to this beginner-friendly Dobsonian.After using the XT10i a few times at a dark sky site, I quickly learned how to handle the instrument and am quite pleased with its performance.First light with this 'scope gave me a stunning view of Orion Nebula complete with a lavender hue (however, keep in mind that the ability to see coloration depends largely on dark sky conditions, age/sensitivity of the viewer's eye, and telescope aperture). I've also spied a purple Ring Nebula, the Whirlpool Galaxy, two cloud bands on Jupiter and four of its moons, a ringed Saturn flanked by four satellites, and Earth's moon using a 15% moon filter.Overall, the XT10i is an excellent choice for anyone, like myself, looking to graduate from the flimsy Sears catalog reflector of their youth."
1,Plumbing Tool,"I thought this was a wrench for dealing with 1 1/4-1 1/2 PVC sink, bath, and lav problems. Not the case. This instrument is designed for something entirely different. The jaws will not close on 1 1/4"" nuts and will barely close on 1 1/2"" nuts. There is no way that this is a plumbing tool for lav and sink drains. Perhaps it will work on tightening sink strainers, but I have other tools for that. Do not buy this for work on 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 PVC."
5,Transformers Energon: Ironhide,"From the new Transformers: Energon toyline comes the heroic Ironhide! Featuring electronic sounds and projectile launching accessories, Ironhide transforms from a blue SUV to mighty robot and back! In addition to these features, Ironhide can combine with the Autobot Jetfire (or other Transformers in the same size class) to form a larger, more powerful robot: Powerlinx Ironhide! Large, well-articulated, and bristling with accessories, Ironhide's playability is undeniable. A great toy, and a definite must-buy for children and collectors alike!"
4,Ironhide,"Ironhide is about 9 inches tall and 2inches wide.Cool modes and easy transformations.He can powerlinx with Jetfire.Ironhides head is exposed in vehicle mode.You might not beleive me but he can powerlinx with Hotshot,Inferno,Prowl.But it doesen't make sense if Ironhide is the top."
2,It just doesn't gell,"This book makes a great effort at trying to understand how various types of Patriot fans react to the team but it just doesn't jell. For one thing not nearly enough attention is paid to the long term fans who were with the Patriots when they were horrible. Also, I can't help but feel a lot of the ""fans"" characterized in this book are the front runners who will drop the Patriots like a bad habit when the team is no longer winning. Also very little is mentioned of the icons of the Patriots over the years such as Gil and Gino and tailgating at Foxboro Stadium. If I had to sum it up I think this book attempts to be all thigns to all people and becomes nothing in return"
4,Great for fans of boogie and blues.,"Camille Howard is pretty much unknown, and that's a shame. It's rare to find a blues woman who can sing AND play (piano) AND write--and do them all well. Very smooth vocals mixed with great boogie riffs make this an album to warm up a cold night. I bought the first volume of this set at a local record chain and was immediately hooked. This album is more of the same--but this set seems to represent her entire solo career, unfortunately. What happened to her? The liner notes tell the story."
2,Gorgeous on the wall...horrible to remove!,"I had bought $1000.00 worth of these ""Walls of the Wild"" fish decals. I put them up as directed with no additional glue. After only 2 years I decided to remove them. Today I have been peeling them, and all layers of paint, and top layer of dry wall with every sticker. I gave them 2 stars because they are gorgeous stickers. Just don't try to take them off...EVER! Now I must go and try to repair 4 walls. I did try the lighter fluid as suggested and it was stinky and did nothing to help."
3,Flashy sounds a bit Trashy,"For fans of Jermaines earlier work this album has to suck, no tracks that sound anything like 1472 to find here. The only track I Like is ""put cha hands up"". It gets my three stars only for the collaborations with Daz. Dupri goes south on this album and I'm sorry to say that he failes misserably. Nice for the collection but not more then that."
2,Decent at best.,"This Album is decent. Theres not much more you can really say about it. It's not worth paying for, and only 2 or 3 of them are even downloadable. Just to Fight, Pastor Troy's song is one of the good songs on there, but the rest are pretty much junk. Dont bother with this one. The only upside, is the decent production.stay away from this one. Sample it definitely before you download."
1,"Should have been called Dumb, unfly, and Trashy","Jermaine Durpri has always been a horrible rapper. All of his albums suck and this is no different. It is a flat out mess from start to finish. Even the tracks that he's not on suck. Don't buy this garbage, it's absolutely one of the worst albums of the year. Jermaine Durpri should stick to producing since that's the only thing he's good at."
2,Trash,I rate this CD 2 stars solely off Bun B's verse on Kodak Moment (RMX). He flows that hard. Everything else: is trash.This is a very weak CD and the fact that it is CONTENT PROTECTED easily make this CD the worst in my collection. Sad.
5,sesamiOil,"This is a good grocery for us.If you cook something,you can use it.It is smells so good.You should buy it."
2,Save your money,"I was very disappointed with this dictionary. First, the battery does not hold a charge for very long. According to the manufacturer this is normal. It must be recharged every two weeks or the battery goes dead. The translations are often spelled differently than most Romanji dictionaries, e.g. ""konnichiha"" instead of ""konnichiwa"". Although technically the spelling is correct, it is not a common spelling anymore. Many of the words are poorly translated. The same company makes a very inexpensive translator that does several languages that is more than adequate for travel. If you are looking to learn Japanese, look elsewhere for a translator. I have purchased superior English-Chinese electronic dictionaries and sentence translators for far less than this costs."
1,FAULTY PRODUCT,"I am about to return my second translator to the company, which, by the way, has VERY strict rules regarding returns so be careful. The first unit froze up on the first day of use. Parts of menus remained on the screen and I had to pull the battery out to re-set it because it wouldn't turn off. My second unit came out of the box with only 1/2 of the screen working, the other 1/2 is white. It looks like it works other than the screen, but still, for that much money they shouldn't fail on the first day out of the box!"
3,Out of scene music,"Nice music, relaxed performing, home environment-all in one.It is good to hear during coocking in a kitchen nearby.However, it is a DVD."
4,GRETCHEN WILSON - UNDRESSED - DVD,"THIS IS AN AFTER SHOW ACOUSTIC JAM SESSION IN GRETCHEN'S DRESSING ROOM ON THE ROAD ON TOUR. SHE AND HER BAND HAVE A GREAT JAM SESSION, THEY ARE RELAXED AND JAM TO UNWIND FROM THE SHOW THAT HAS JUST BEEN PERFORMED. YOU GET TO SEE GRETCHEN IN A MORE INTIMITE WAY.THIS IS A FUN DVD TO WATCH, GRETCHEN AND HER BAND ARE GREAT!!! THIS JAM SESSION IS GREAT!!! IF YOU LIKE GRETCHEN, YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE. THEY PLAY SOME OF THEIR HITS AND ALSO THROW IN SOME OTHER SONGS LIKE THE JIMMIE RODGER'S CLASSIC ""MULE SKINNER BLUES""!!!THIS IS A FUN ONE FOLKS, AND I RECOMMEND IT!!! I'LL BE GLAD WHEN SHE RELEASES A FULL CONCERT DVD!!! I'VE SEEN HER PERFORM ON HER ""REDNECK REVOLUTION TOUR"", SHE IS A NATURAL PERFORMER,SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!"
4,NICE EASY LISTENING DVD,Cant wait for more from Gretchen as i enjoyed watching and listening too this dvd
4,THE PEOPLES BIBLE,"I bought this book for my wife who is catholic. She liked it because it contained prayers for different religions. The binding was excellent. I can't say much about this book, because I'm not interested in religion.Saul wanetick"
1,"Before Publishing, Do the Work First","This book title is for democratic Republic of Congo, but failed to realize that the flag on the book is of the Republic of Congo. There are two countries with the names of Congo, I will suggest the author to ckeck it out."
1,Garbage pineapple,"This product was OK for the first few shipments but then I started receiving garbage. There was about 2/3 fruit and 1/3 pineapple core in each can. I decided to try this brand due to similar problems with Dole pineapple, except to a much lesser extent with Dole. After having to spit out out garbage with each bite taken this morning, I just cancelled my upcoming order. This company obviously has very poor quality control of their canned pineapple. They have lost me for good as a customer."
5,I'd give it 50 stars if there was such rating!,"Fairuz needs no intro, and this album is her dedication to the beautiful bibical city, the holy city of Jersalem..each and every song is incredible, attractive, touching. the music is so beautiful that it doesn't make you all that dependable on lyrics.but because I'm an Arab, i think the lyrics must be translated, it is poetry in it's most romantic form.super CD, my best and most favourite CD of Fairuz, or any other artiest!"
5,"""DICK CLARK IS THE ANTICHRIST""","O.K....let me start off by saying I'm not really that much into religion. But, I honestly believe that BILL HICKS was an angel, sent down from heaven by GOD, to open our eyes to what is REALLY going on in the world. Not only is Bill hilarious, he is also brutally HONEST. I consider Bill a preacher/comedian. The very first time I heard Bill perform, I cried. Not from laughing so hard, but by realizing the TRUTH. Not to sound over-dramatic, but Bill changed my life. I now look at political,religious,and other serious issues in our society in a completly different way.Bill Hicks is nothing short of genius. I own every one of his albums and dvds, and I never get tired of listening to him or watching him perform. Its such a shame that he had to leave us so early. And, we should be grateful, that GOD sent him to us. I hope that whoever is reading this, will buy his cds or watch his dvds and experience what I did. And, maybe he can have an impact on other lives as well."
2,drier than Melbourne water catchments,"Ok, so semantics isn't the sexiest thing in linguistics (if you think it is, you might like this book), so could they really make it any drier? Hardly any examples, boring tone, unclear explanations... pure sleep-inducing material. I wish someone would write a better semantics text - I might have slept less and gotten a higher grade..."
2,Missing info on transfer case,"I was suprised to see all the transfer case referances and info missing. P/N is the same on all the manuals, there is no warning of missing info on this choice that I Saw, perhaps more reading on my part of the discription would have helped but the book P/N is the same on both.Also wasnt pleased with Chilton's parts diagrams (or lack of).This purchase turned out to be a waste of time for me, I didn't expect that this AWD feature (option) would be missing from a manual."
3,I need to know???,Could the seller with the Chilton Chevy Astro repair manual inclusive of the years: 1994-2003 please tell me if it contains ALL WHEEL DRIVE or not?? Thanks--BrkCin@aol.com
3,Book is very small- not what I expected,This book is similar in size to a freebie handout. It was also over priced by Amazon at $4.99 when the back of the book's UPC label said that the book was priced at $2.99. I contacted Amazon and they corrected my bill immediately.My husband really likes John Eldrege books and I think that he will enjoy the book... it was just not what I expected.
3,Nothing new here...,"The book is a very quick read of an interesting subject. However, there is nothing new to offer on the subject from the author. The book is OK but search for others if you are struggling with parenting and/or in need of a deeper review of the subject."
2,"""Snippet""","I ordered, received, and RETURNED this item.... If I had known it was a ""snippet"" of Wild At Heart (a book I already OWN!) I never would have purchased it... the price printed on the cover as the retail price was $2.99.... I paid $6.95 (when included with a couple of other books: I got free shipping....)Disappointed and awaiting the refunded amount to show on my credit card...You should just get the WHOLE J. Eldredge books -- the Wild At Heart is def. an AMAZING book and ALL fathers (and mothers, for that matter!!) should really enjoy the God-given wisdom and enjoyable stories and anecdotes in many of Mr. Eldredge's books! He is an incredibly gifted author and worth the cost of buying and reading the entire book...Unless you are intending to give this 'booklet' to a new father to whet his appetite for the whole book, I suggest you save your money."
4,GREAT INVALUABLE TOOL FOR WHOSE WHO IN WASHINGTON!,"My 1996 edition is so dog-eared, highlighted, and noted that you can tell it's one of my most common reference tools. I use it when politicians are on talk shows, to give me an idea of where they are coming from. It usually proves there is a huge media imbalance of views on network television, so I've switched to C-Span. Seeing a voting record clues me in on where a Congressman is likely to stand on an issue, before he opens his mouth. I use it for background information, and to send faxes and letters. I use it to keep track of my own Congressmen and to find others who have voted the way I would vote, to contact, if an important issue is pending for a vote. It's only big handicap is a lack of E-Mail addresses. I could do much more with it, if I had them. I highly recommend this book and am saving for an updated version."
3,mistake,I am sorry I thought it was a different cd I was looking for. However the item was in good shape and the delivery was good.
2,Can't listen in car,"This is not at all what I was looking for, so call it a $13.00 mistake (purchased in a used bookstore that doesn't accept returns). I wanted something my young kids and I could listen to in the car, but these audio tapes are useless. The English translations are in the book, not on the tape, so you have no idea what you're repeating or why, and the book is too advanced for the little ones to be able to follow along. They start out with people's names (Juan, Juanita, etc.) and then the next lessons are random words, the alphabet, a list of Latin American countries, vowel sounds. I would have liked to start with the most useful phrases in any language - hello, good-bye, thank you, numbers, big/small, etc. I'm not trying to learn how read and write, or even speak, fluently - just enough to function in day-to-day transactions, such as with neighbors, or at the store, and to give my kids some basic exposure."
5,Classy and Cool,This is great - not only looks great but protects my phone from everything. Still easy to dial numbers - the case doesn't get in the way. I wish I would've all the colors! Terrific product.
5,Wonderful photos!!,We have visited the places written and photographed for this book. The photos are so vivid and realistic. We came across this book in a general store and sat in the rockers enjoying every page.
2,Not as fun as it sounds,"This is not a Christian Karma Sutra as I supposed when I bought it. It is a study on the Song of Songs, as the subtitle says. I bought it impulsively, but don't all together regret it: it is a great conversation piece on the bookshelf."
4,Pretty Nice Rack!,"Overall, I was very pleased with this product. The finished piece is very attractive, fits well into my decor, is functional and of good quality. My major complaint is that the one page instructions are almost useless. The tiny blurry pictures were almost impossible to see and I spent a lot of time screwing parts in upside down or backwards and then having to disassemble and try again. It's also somewhat top-heavy and slightly unstable, but bracketing it to the wall helps with this somewhat. However, even with the overly long assembly time and the slight wobbliness, I am very happy with this product."
1,horrible,I bought this seat two months ago and then it was ok. It's so hard to adjust and I think it's a horrible design. When my son got bigger he doesn't even fit in to it no more and he is 8 months. Don't buy
4,Excellent toddler car seat,"I purchased this car seat for my 15 month who refused to go in her infant carseat anymore. She absolutely loves this one! It's very comfortable and has excellent padding! She even lets me strap her in without any fuss... She used to push up with her feet and fight me not to get strapped in. What a difference!The belt is much easier to adjust and buckle than the Baby Trend carseat that I got used to. (My husband refused to strap her in because it worked so hard, so it was my job.) I do caution to be careful when adjusting to make sure you don't over tighten the straps.The latch system works great in my tiny Corolla (in the passenger side rear seat). I actually have space to stand between the car seat and the front seat! And now two nice-sized people can actually sit in the back seat with the baby. I am very happy.My only complaint is that in the forward position, it is difficult to recline the carseat."
1,Worst seat ever!,"My wife and I bought this seat for our son at 4 months old because he outgrew his infant carrier. The reasons we bought it were that it looked easy to adjust, and its relatively compact size. What we didn't know until much later was that the shoulder straps are set too wide for an infant. When our son fell asleep, his shoulders would slide out of the straps-no matter how well it was adjusted. We kept it because we thought it would be better when he was older and forward facing, as he would be bigger and this wouldn't happen. Well, when he did get bigger, we found that the adjustment mechanism is almost impossible to work with the child in the seat. I give up. My reccomendation is to stay away from evenflo. The others are much better."
5,Love it!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this car seat. We have had no problems. The straps do take a little getting use to, but not a big deal. If you have injured yourself from adjusting the straps, you are adjusting way to often."
5,The Young Ones - Seasons 1 and 2,"Back many years ago my brother turned me onto this series. I watched the episodes a couple of times and enjoyed. I finally purchased the DVD set for my brother for Xmas and recently purchased for myself at Amazon. I have watched all episodes at least 20 times each. Like some of my favorite movies I quote lines from The Young Ones often. It was very cool to see one of my favorite bands ""Motorhead"" as a musical guest (Season 2 - Ep 1..Bambi..favorite episode). Just like Seinfeld, I will watch these shows many times until I meet my Maker."
1,Big Disappointment,"After reading some of the very favorable reviews, I decided to include this item to get me over the $25 hump for free shipping. I am fond of miso soup and very fond of good noodles. I found this soup to be weak on flavor and I thought the noodles were awful (my personal opinion.) They were mushy and had no ""chew"" at all. I am trashing the other five containers."
4,"Tasty, quick and fairly healthy meal","Like the fact the noodles are organic. The taste is pleasant. Good value. A bit high in salt. My pet peeve is reading the nutrition facts and discovering the container is labelled as 2 servings. As we all know, this cup contains basically one (medium to small) serving. So really instead of 90 calories, it has 180 (no biggie). And the sodium instead of 340 mg is really 680mg... Great that it provides 8g of protein. Would definitely buy again, but Dr. McDougall, could you please update the label to concede that this cup = 1 serving?"
4,Add a Little Spice!,This has become a 'go to' favorite from the Dr. McDougall collection. Just add red pepper flakes if you prefer hot and spicy!
1,Pretty bad,"This tastes nothing like miso or ramen so I'm not sure why they bothered labeling it as such. It does turn into a soupy substance when you add your own water though. So, how does it taste you ask? Bad. Not inedibly bad but bad nonetheless. The two things that immediately popped into my mind were 1) What's the point? and 2) So this must be what meals in 3rd world prisons taste like. This is not a product for someone who actually enjoys food."
1,Tasted Terrible!,"I have read the other reviews about this and I do not understand how people could think this tasted good. I thought it was horrible and I couldn't even finish it. It left a terrible almost metallic aftertaste that made me want to rinse my mouth out. Maybe I received a bad package. I also had a friend try and he thought it was terrible, as well."
4,great soup,"This is one of the best miso soups short of being at a good restaurant. Convenient to bring to work/school, very tasty, and healthy to boot. Well done Dr. McDougall's Right Foods."
1,"If you like food, don't order this product!","I have ordered and eaten many McDougal foods. I have had great luck losing weight with his products and when I had to lose 20 pounds I ordered the foods I used to like and lost the 20 in one month. This Miso ""soup"" was one of the most awful, horrendous and disgusting foods I've ever ordered from this company or any company!! I'm so mad because they do not allow returns of food items even though 5 of them are un-opened. I tried over and over again to microwave this product but the noodles will not cook correctly. Over and over again they continue to stay stiff and distasteful. I will give credit when credit is due and tell you that many of his foods are good. I don't understand why this is so bad. The best foods he has are his oatmeal breakfasts and some of the rice combos. I can't say often enough how disappointed I am with this particular cup of mush! Don't waste your money on this. Noodles my a*#. What were they thinking???"
3,Decent product,"Not bad...just a little bland and not much in the cup. I add some more ""stuff"" to it and use it as a base. I realize that's not the point of an instant soup, but if you're prepping it at home and have time to add some more items to it, it's fantastic! I add some additional wakame seaweed, fresh tofu, brewer's yeast, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. I'm sure shitake mushrooms would be great too, but I haven't tried that yet.I'm a much bigger fan of the Vegan Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf, perfect as is, no additional ingredients required and HIGHLY addictive! :)BTW, AVOID the Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup at all costs. It's absolutely disgusting: hard to mix, smells like BO, and tastes bland."
2,bland,"This product seems to have a good quality, but it's really bland. After adding some broth concentrate, my son liked it. No one in my house liked it as it is."
1,contains mystery ingredients,"I keep coming back to this brand because it is ""almost"" healthy. I just can't get past the 2 questionable ingredients: yeast extract & natural flavors. These are 2 ingredients that almost always contain MSG. If they didn't, why would they be in there with such odd names. Why wouldn't it just say flour or carrots? When I make soup at home I never add anything called natural flavors, and wouldn't know where to get yeast extract. These are unnecessary ingredients that I am guessing are not so natural and are probably flavor enhancers. I wouldn't care so much, but MSG in any form gives me a headache. If the ingredients read ""MSG"" or ""Monosodium Glutamate"" many customers would avoid the product. Hence the need to be covert. Google MSG and read how many ingredients (additives) actually contain MSG. Very frustrating."
2,"Bland, weird ramen","I've tried several of Dr. McDougall's products and typically find them tasty. This miso noodle soup however, is pretty nasty. The noodles are ramen, but not GOOD ramen. They are thin, flat, and have a strange aftertaste and texture. The flavor of the soup itself isn't miso, but a bland approximation of it. It tastes more like a watered down salty broth. There isn't much wakame, and a few more tiny chucks of tasteless tofu. This has been sitting in my cupboard for months and will continue to sit there until I run out of absolutely everything else. I'd give it away, but I don't want the recipient to be mad at me when they taste this stuff."
2,Not Really...,"If you add about a 1/2 teaspoon of miso paste to each cup you'll have something resembling miso soup - but if you have to do that, why bother getting these ramen pks?"
5,Awesome soup - everyone in the house LOVES it!,"I've tried most of the McDougal soup varieties, and this is by far everyone's favorite (the Spring Noodle is a close second for me, but the kids aren't as keen on that one). My husband couldn't say enough good things about it either. Don't listen to the negative reviews, it really is yummy!"
5,Dr. mcDougall's soups,"Love Dr. McDougall's soup! The best healthy, natural and tasty soup out there---favorite is the Miso soup which is healthier version of 'Cup of Noodles' brand....great buy for a great product! Thanks Amazon for carrying it and thanks to UPS for delivering it!"
1,"One of the worst ""thrillers"" I've ever read.","This was such an awful and clunky book. The story made zero sense and zipped around the world. The big secret was laughable. I kept reading hoping that the big reveal would make it worth it...um, no. The fact that some WWII vets had deciphered a Nazi code that revealed that something vague, and semi-sinister would happen at some point in time was enough to worry supposed illuminati-style bad guys enough to hunt them across the globe and kill them? Please. It was sad. It was so bad that I threw it in the trash when I was three-quarters through it. I just couldn't make myself finish it. ""But what happened to the..."" I don't care. I will never read another Jon Land book. It was awful!!!"
5,Fantastic!!,"I actually picked up this book on a whim and from the first page, I was unable to put it down. If you like Dan Browns' work, then you'll love Jon Land. I give my highest recommendations for this book...now I have to go and buy the rest of the series."
1,Just plain horrible,"If you're looking for writing that is as clever or as witty as Dean Koontz's, take one pace back away from this book. If you're expecting storyytelling on par with John Grisham, take another step back. If you're hoping for a story loaded with interesting tidbits and facts on par with Dan Brown, take another step back.This book was unoriginal, boring, predictable, and very cliche. Don't waste your time or your money like I did."
1,"Boring, predictable and un-original","First of all, the book's main premise is barely credible as are much of the events in this book (Americans attacking an island in France? Please.) This novel is written in a wanna-be-Dan-Brown style but clearly lacking the skills of his fellow author. Overall, the book lacks a decent instigative element. Why would the Arabs care what Nostradamus wrote? It just makes no sense that they would run after a piece of paper written by Nostradamus that vaguely describes a terrorist attack. Had they not looked for it, their plan would've probably worked since the old veterans had no clue where to start looking. Just an awful trash read."
2,overrated,"I was told to use a brush (for my Havanese dog) that did not have the ""balls"" on top so that the ""hair"" does not break. I tell you that this expensive brush was not worth all the money I paid for it. it doesn't seem to make that much of a difference what type of brush you use unless you have your dog in the dog shows. Maybe then this would be a good choice for you."
4,No Comment!,"This year has sent me off exploring 90's Electronica , Autechre through to The Orb. As nothimg had really caught my interest this year until I heard Scott Matthews ""Elusive "", went to his webstite and downloaded the live video where interest turned into more then just interest. Then went on to pre-order the Album at Amazon .I won't say what I think of the Album ""Passing Stranger"", I will leave that to a reviewer who is more gifted than I am . It could also upset some Hardcore Jeff Buckley fans and I'm afraid there are not enough sharks in the Pacific Ocean to stop them all from swimming across. Also came the realization that I have played Led Zepplin #I more than any other album.Thankyou to the Triple J listner who informed the radio station of Scott Matthews , and Triple J's"" 2007"" program for playing ""Elusive"", and Amazon.Passing Stranger"
1,Huh?,"These guys opened for Plant/Krauss in Amsterdam last night.About 25 minutes with Matthews ,a drummer, and Cello player.The entire hall was bored stiff after about five minutes ,extremely boring accoustic guitarist, and not much of a singer.Very noodly wandering melodies with simple repetitive chord structures. Plant, Krauss and company were incendiary but a very poor choice of opening act."
3,"Be aware, shirts run small!","Cute shirt that I can't wait to see my 3 y/o nephew wearing! The shirt is 100% cotton so my only concern is whether it will shrink...The sizes run extremely small, I ordered a 6 and wish I could have ordered an 8! Order at least 2 sizes larger..."
1,Taliban thought,"I can not imagine why anyone would perpetuate such a Taliban thought, that women, or in this case, infant girls, need to be locked up to ""protect"" them from males of every age. We have obviously not come a long way baby."
5,great product,"With a small dog, fleas are easy to spot on them. With one application they were gone. She didn't have ticks, so no problem. Great price and shipping was pretty fast too."
1,The fleas are still here,I purchased this item and after 2 applications 4 weeks apart the fleas are still here. I saw no difference and would not buy this item again. I am using Frontline on my 55lb dog and intend to switch my smaller dogs to this product.
3,"Mediocre, probably will switch back to other","I switched to Advantage because the third round of Frontline drops (month 9 & 10) I used were not as effective as the previous. Unfortunately, one round of Advantage and I'm already inclined to switch back. I've heard fleas may just become resisistent over time, I just figured it would take longer than four months. Oh well. Ill be finishing off the box anyways, and will review again if things improve."
1,Did not work,"I have never had problems with fleas on my 7 lb yorkie. We switched over from Revolution to Advantage because of the great price and free shipping here on Amazon. Poor dog got fleas after starting Advantage and even putting the medicine on again after less than a month, the fleas are still alive and healthy! Maybe this is a bad batch from Amazon but I'm throwing the last 4 months away and going back to Revolution."
2,Buyer Beware,"I put this product on my 4 chihauhau's and they experienced severe reactions. Two of them had severe itching, redness of their skin, and hair loss. I will never use any of these toxic flea repellents again. I will only use natural means of flea control. I implore you to read up on these products before applying them to your animals. It has taken almost 6 weeks for these symptoms to cease. The fleas themselves were not causing the problems that this product caused. I have researched and found a natural flea control from the cedarcidestore."
1,Never received this product,they made me wait 3 weeks and I never got the item?? so could I rate? sence I never got it minus one star!
1,Doesn't work,I tried two tubes on my Maltese with little or not results. The dog still has fleas. We are switching to Comfortis pill to try and eliminate the problem.
2,if only there were only fleas....,"I'll not buy Advantage again; had I spent more for Advantix my dogs wouldn't have had the trouble they did. But Frontline works on both fleas and ticks and doesn't cost much more than this did... and it's what I've used in the past. My dogs both developed ear infections from having ticks crawl deep into their ears. The vet visit and medications, including two tick collars to pick up where the Advantage left off, was around $200. But I did save $10 by buying Advantage rather than Frontline!!! (How entirely stupid of me!)"
1,Free Super Saver Shipping,"The Advantage works great on my dogs, however if I knew Amazon's free shipping meant that we would have to wait 3 weeks to receive it, I would have ordered this product from another vendor. As explained by Amazon, they save with their shipping carrier by shipping bulk orders out on crates, which means your item being shipped ""Free"" via the Super Saver option can take on average 3 or a little more weeks to be delivered depending on how quickly Amazon fill's up a crate in your region.An Amazon customer service rep offered to expedite my shipping to their 3-day option for an additional $5.00 when the order was already going to be shipping in 3 days, which was the absolute latest date they were allowed to hold my order under their free shipping policy, so why would I want to pay five more dollars! I expected more from Amazon on this one, rather than insulting my intelligence."
2,Received the wrong product,Bought Advantage for dogs over 55 lbs and I received an Advantage for smaller dogs. Does not do well for an 80 lb Boxer.
2,???,I was searcing under K9 Advantix and somehow ended up here. No wonder the price was so low - this is Advantage - Advantix's poor cousin. nOT happy but stuck 'cause the dog is overdue for flea treatment.
4,Works Fine,"I used to use a Pyrethrins based product on my Cairn Terrier. I've switched to this imidacloprid/insect growth regulator combination for the past year and it does a better job.We live in a City with row homes and most houses have a dog &/or cat so fleas and ticks are an issue. I'm a certified pest control manager and I've used various chemical concoctions over the years, getting smarter/safer as time went on and I use this product for its ability to protect my pet and my comfort level with its chemistry. Amazon provides the most reasonable costs that I have been able to find and I will be purchasing it again in another month or two for next year's supply."
5,advantage fleas med,"I have three months supply left and when I reorder, which I most certainly will, I will order for twelve months.I placed the order early in the week and had it by the end of the week.I was truly impressed after the email stated 12 to 14 days.Thanks"
5,"Advantage for Dogs over 55 lbs, 6 applications","Very fast shipping, well packaged and just as described. I would buy from this seller again."
5,"It works and it's cheap, or at least cheaper.","This is much cheaper than anywhere else I could find and it just plain works. Kind of weird, bur pest control guy even recommended it saying it is the least harmful one and the fleas in our area, central texas, haven't built an immunity to it. It works well, and our 30lb mini australian shepherd and 30lb rat terrier haven't had any problems. Just ran out and have already put my 2nd order in. After about a day or 2 I don't even notice the oily spot. I put it on them before going to sleep for the night, separate beds, to make sure they don't try to lick it off each other."
2,Scam- doesn't work,"I think this is either expired or a knockoff. It's supposed to start killing fleas within hours, 2 weeks and my poor dog is still infested. I am trying to return the product, have not heard back from them yet. I only hope there wasn't anything toxic in there if indeed it is a knockoff."
2,Useless in NW Florida,"Due to the severity of fleas in NW Florida, product did not work. Seemed to only stir them up a bit, not killing any of them! In fact, after two applications a week apart, the fleas are worse than ever!! This product may work on fleas in other parts of the country, but down here in this humidity, fleas need something a lot stronger... switching to Comfortis"
3,Not as good as it used to be...,"In the ""old days"" before Advantage and Frontline became available it was the tiresome routine of wash the dogs, spray the house and lawn with noxious chemicals and repeat. It often took an entire Saturday. These drops were a blessing. Now the Advantage seems to be losing it's effectiveness. My vet agrees, saying they need to tweek their formula. I've started using Frontline one month, then Advantage the next month. It's the only way to keep fleas away."
1,This Advantage did NOT work!,"We have bought Advantage through Amazon many times, and it has always worked great. But this last batch has been completely ineffective. Might as well put water on my dogs. My dogs are small, little silky terriers, and one is horribly allergic to fleas, so we are having a terrible time. The fleas are very healthy!! We don't know what to do other than try a different company, either from Amazon or elsewhere. Sorry, Amazon, but this batch of medicine was a complete dud!!!!!"
1,Sadly Lacking,"I am sorry...this just is not working with my dog. The fleas are all over her. Wow, what a loss of money for a product that does not work well, at all! And we bathed her first, and they are not even fazed, those fleas."
4,THIS worked (Frontline Plus didn't) - so pleased!,"As stated in my title, the Frontline Plus did NOT work ... virtually at all. And, their ""satisfaction guarantee"" is full of holes and you have to use it (even if totally ineffective) on your dog for a minimum of 3 mos. before consideration is made for a refund. Anyway, I ordered the Advantage after reading about so many positive (and safe!!) reviews. And this absolutely worked. We've had it on our 6 mo. old pomeranian for over a week now and it is still working nicely. After the first bath following the application (about 3 days later) at least 20 dead fleas were in the water and on the towel and we still found some days later. She only rarely scratches now and we cannot visually find ANY whereas they were easily seen, along with the black residue, prior to the application. I'm very happy with this product."
3,Advantage for dogs under 10 pounds (Green Label) (AMAZON.COM),Smooth transaction. Shipping was prompt. I use Advantage every year and it works great. The only problem I have with this order is: I don't see an expiration date anywhere on the box nor on the tubes. This makes me wonder how old the product is. I'm sure the Expiration date is somewhere among the numbers but I have no clue where to find the date. I just applied the product 2 days ago. We shall see.
2,Advantage melts plastic! Beware!,"We've been using Advantage for cats on our kitty for four months, and decided to switch the dog over to Advantage too. After application, the dog shook, spraying little drops of it all over our living room. Any plastic the product hit (including the glossy black frame and base of our plasma TV) immediately developed PITS in the plastic, even though I grabbed a cloth to wipe it clean as soon as it happened. A Google search for ""Advantage flea"" and ""plastic"" shows that this has happened before and actually endangered an animal. Make sure you use caution when applying this product!! It's a good flea preventative, but this side-effect is not documented or warned about on the package."
1,Advantage didn't work,"This product is supposed to last about a month, but after a week and a half, our dogs were still infested with fleas. Before we applied the product, we had bathed our dogs, treated the yard and house. We were very disappointed with this product. We will never use it again."
2,Sub-par flea control,"My first annoyance was the amount of time delivery took. I have ordered and used this product through another supplier, and it was fast and effective--delivery & pest control...I know it took about a week or more to get shipping info and the product. I also feel either this batch was not as good or it was 'bootleg' because it was only 2-3 weeks at best of pest control."
4,Product very effective,3 Days after applying we could no longer find live fleas on the dogs. A week after that they stopped itching.
3,helped the dog for a little while,it worked for a little while then the flees came back so you would have to apply it all the time
4,Good product,"My dog is a shop dog, he is always outside or rolling around in dirt. Its been a month and so far, no fleas. I like how its a monthly treament, makes it easy to remember. I gave it four stars cause i havent tried the second month yet. Hopefully still no fleas. :)"
4,Good Deal!,"Before I purchase anything nowadays I check Amazon first. As always I'm glad I did. This is a great price for the product. As far as flea meds go, Advantage has successfully eliminated fleas on some occasions and reduced fleas in others. I have a few dogs which make controling fleas a bit more of a challange.Advantage always helps. One major plus, it did eliminate a minor tick problem I before it became a big issue."
1,Bad Company,Show advantage 100 and ship plain advantage. Bate and switch. Plain advantage does not kill lice and is not water prove.
5,excellent!,The Advantage worked great for my dog and outside cats! No more fleas or ticks! And it was much cheaper than Frontline!
4,Great price for an excellent product!,"I've been using Advantage on my two dogs for several years, always searching for the best price available, and now I seem to have found it. Not only is the product effective, but Amazon offers it at a lower price than many of the outfits that advertise much more heavily."
1,Flea drops,"This product took way to long to get here, by the time I received it the dog I bought it for was to old to use on, will not be buying from this place again"
2,Good for fleas,"This medicine is good for protection against fleas, but it doesn't have tic medicine. There are thousands of species of tics out there - it is not a good idea to leave your animal unprotected. There are many types of tics out there that will kill your family pet."
2,Still Scratching my head over Advantage,"We bought Advantage rather than Frontline or Advantix to save a couple bucks, and our 60lb hound stopped scratching for a bit, but she developed this really foul odor shortly after we applied it. Within 2 days the stink was so bad we had to bathe her. It's been a couple weeks now and she's scratching again and i can see flea dirt on her belly. Hopefully entirelypets.com has a good return policy. I think our Redbone will stick with Advantix instead..."
4,Tick control,"I have used Advantix for cats for years so when I started keeping my cousins dogs for a few months I naturally started using Advantix for dogs. I live in the country and this year the ticks are really bad. I have found many on the dogs but they are barely moving or dead. I have not been disappointed. Thank you Advantix.DianneGoodview, VA."
1,very bad customer service,"After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was ""serviced"" by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb."
3,It works,"I wish I could tell how well these flea preventors really work, but all I can tell by is my dogs itching habbits. The other ones are supposed to be better but with Advantage I actually see the dogs itch themselves less, so I can only assume it's killing the fleas. It only works for around 3 weeks though."
1,Disappointed,"Unfortunately this didn't help my Pekingese after day 2. She stopped itching for a day and she does have less fleas, but by day 3 she's back to itching constantly. I've treated the house and that didn't help. I think I just need to go to the Vet and get something that works."
5,No complaints and appears to be working.,I have only been using this for a couple months and it appears to work just fine with no side effects. I see the dog scratching a lot less and haven't spotted a flea since we started using it. I simple apply the medicine to the back of the dogs neck after a bath and then let it air dry. As simple as that. Can't beat the price online either. I got a six month supply for only $17.
5,good product,Product seems to be working. Have not found any fleas on my dogs. Item arrived within a few days. Great Price. Will most likely order again from seller.
1,Book cannot be read,This book cannot be read because the text is totally garbled. Text is totally mixed up; sentences are chopped up and incomplete. The publisher has a note in the inside cover declaring that this is just an OCRed copy. As such it should not be sold.
5,great gudelines,"i am just about to open my own nursery and have found this book to be an excellent source of information, Excellent guidelines and appropriate activities for a specific age group....i have yet to come across a book with such detailed information both for teachers and children. This book is also great for those who are not in the teaching field and require information with regard to opening a daycare, or summer camp."
4,Nice bag,"Overall I am very pleased with the bag. My computer is very well protected and there is room for all my paperwork as well. It's well made and looks sturdy.An improvement would be a bigger outside pocket for keys and such, but it does have an attached zippered pouch so you don't have to dig around for small items that could get lost in the bottom. Also, the suede is hard to clean and I know that I'm going to take this bag where it has to sit on the floor. Leather might have been a better choice for me - but I wanted pink! I'm happy that it supports the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure."
4,This was a trip,"This was a trip, this woman was in over her head. I really can't wait to read Part 2 to this."
1,too long,THIS BOOK IS GOOD IN THE BEGINING BUT THEN IT JUST DRAGS AND DRAGS IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ONE BOOK WAY TOO MUCH AFTER I READ IT I RIPPED IT TO SHREDDS.
1,Language Barrier,I agree with the RAWSISTAZ review. I was glad when this novel came to an end. It didn't make any sense. No wonder why this book is being passed around so quickly on campuss--no one is finishing it. One of the worst books of 2005.
5,very exciting,THis book was so good i couldn't put it down i just wanted to know what would happen next
5,Da BOMB!,Triangle of Sins is most definitely a book that everyone should read. I love the characters and I loved the plot. I am so anxiously waiting for the sequel.
5,A REAL PAGE-TURNER,"Ok, ok. there is a slow beginning and you may not like Natalia much. But the every chapter, something is happening and new events, tragedies are developing. Lies, Scandals, sex, drama, love are all in this book. I am telling you I stayed up to 4 am to finish reading this book.You will love Shawn and the man he becomes at the end.You won't really like Natalia, but will give her some props through out the book.Over all very, very entertaining book."
5,EXCELLENT DEBUT,This was definitely one of the best books I've read this year.I hope the sequel is not too far behind.
4,I'mma Give This A 4,"I gotta give this a 4 for the fact the Nat was being so stupid that i had to skip a couple of the parts with her. But overall this book was a page turner, I was dissappointed at how it ended. But I'm waithing to read part2, it better be as good as the first book."
5,Five Stars!!,"This book took drama to much higher level; the plots, twist and turns in the book are sophisticated. The author had much imagination when writing this story. The mistunderstandings between he characters are quite real and possible. I can't wait for ""Rectangle of Sins"", now that they have a newborn baby involved. Great story!"
5,Gideon - Kenny's best concept album!,"This is Kenny's absolute best concept album, hands down! I once had this title on an 8-track cartridge tape, and completely wore it out from repeated and constant playback so many times. Thank heavens I recently found it on CD. However, it was quite costly, but it was more than well worth it. I love all of Kenny Rogers' songs, but the ""Gideon"" album is my favorite of his albums. I'd like to start a blog or website about KR's music, and this album particularly! I just never tire of listening to the whole album. Kenny's music, to me, is more than just music. This record is a way of life!"
3,Nice effort,"I own every single Hanoi Rocks CD plus the Japan imports and a couple European 12"" singles. I also have Michael's solo stuff, Jerusalem Slim, Demolition 23 and two Andy McCoy CD's. My point is that I have been a fan for many many years! ""12 Shots..."" is a great addition to any HR fans collection. However, if you are just starting out, don't discover them with this CD. Get ""Oriental Beat"" or ""Bangkok Rocks..."" or one of the greatest hits packages. While ""12 Shots"" is not bad, it's not great either. They playing isn't as fluid and spontaneous as their original albums and the lyrics aren't as fun either. Still, if you're already a fan of Hanoi, make room for this disc in your collection."
2,Pocket book !,"I am deceived, I would have rated this book 4 or 4.5 stars if it was not for its format: 6""x7"". The pirelli calendar is about brilliant pictures taken by some of the most reknown photographers at the peak of their craft! Therefore when you have 4 pictures printed on a page, you are left with very small images wich fall short from giving them the acknoledgement they deserve. What was supposed to be a feast for the eyes leaves you on your appetite. Dont get me wrong, the book is well made and printed, and after having said all that, it's a bargain to have the entire 1964 to 2001 era in one book!"
3,Mixed Bag of Babes Kicking Booty,"Overall, I'd say the book was decent, neither outstanding nor terrible. The introduction had me laughing out loud. The rest was just ok, some of the stories were downright boring. My favorites were And Ladies of the Club by Elizabeth Moon, Armor-Ella by Holly Lisle, Career Day by Margaret Ball, Blood Calls to Blood by Elisabeth Waters. I wanted to like the last story for its gaming aspects but it just got too boring for me (Maureen Birnbaum in the MUD by George Alec Effinger).The other stories were just forgettable. The anthology as a whole took me several months, but that's all right since each story was completely separate. It's a fun collection as a whole, but you definitely can't go into it thinking it'll be serious in any sense."
3,Enjoyable fantasy,"I read Science Fiction.I enjoy fantasyI enjoy and learn from SCIENCE Fiction.I avoid Horror.The latest science is for me more interesting and educational than all the fantasy in the world.Fantasy includes techno-bable.SCIENCE Fiction starts off with a knowledgeable author being impressed with the latest thinking in any of the sciences and then showing how a what if scenereo could evvolve using people who are at least real seeming.Chicks in Chain mail is fantasy because rarely do we see any interest in how a 100 to 150 pound woman is going to fight a 200 to 300 pound monster.But Chicks in Chainmail, the whole series is a fun read.Pete"
2,From mediocre to dire,"There are a few half-decent entertaining works in this book. In fact about half of them are average, mildly entertaining stories. The problem is the other half are below average to flat out dire.The arrangement of the stories left something to be desired as well. Placing the very worst story of the collection in the fourth slot, after a couple below average tales almost put an end to my reading right there. The story I'm speaking of is the Hilary Clinton in Valhalla tale.Even the better stories are hobbled by the restrictions of the collection. One after the other of stories that are very similar, bad jokes that aren't presented too differently from one story to the other just wears the reader down with the lack of variety. Really, how many breastplate asides and jokes are necessary?Suffice to say that the title is the cleverest part of the collection. Good idea, but it wasn't pulled off.2.5 stars that I rounded down to a 2."
4,Another book that Whacks Stereotypes in the chops,"Chicks in Chainmail is one of those books that had to be a volume of irony, the title wouldn't permit anything else. Friesner's relating the (real? fictional) difficulties in getting people to get the title accepted is a good start, and the book goes right on from there, shredding stereotypes, stomping on the fragile male ego (you know, us males ARE the genetically disadvantaged ones, ask any doctor), and in general having a good time stepping on those preconceptions that people tuck away in the back of their head. Some people may not like the one-note nature of the book, but I think THAT'S THE POINT! The selective taxation story ought to be mailed direcly to our present congress, too. I read it on a plane, and again when I got home. Then my spouse captured it and giggled until about 3 in the morning."
4,Great help for class wildflower project,"This book really helped my son with his wildflower project for science class.Many of the other books we checked out of the library were too complicated for him (and I) to use and were not detailed enough.It is organized by flower color which made it easier to get a correct identification. The only down side is that all of the flowers are not pictured in color...some of them are drawn in black and white within a color family.However, I would recommend this book as it was easy for my 8th grade son to use on his own for the project."
2,Seriously showing its age,"This book was written in 1968 and then updated in 1996. While it contains a wealth of information the illustrations of the wild flowers are black and white sketches with a few color sketches included in all but the white plant sections. For actual field identification, it would be far better to have actual plant pictures. Even the Peterson First Guides to Wildflowers contains all color illustrations. My other field guides with photographs are more useful. Maybe the Peterson Field Guide Service might consider redoing this book as an iPhone/iPad app in the future. Until, I do not recommend this field guide."
4,"Great, comprehensive guide","This book is an excellent field guide; the drawings are very accurate and it is fairly easy to identify your specimen. However, be aware that many of the drawings are black and white, though the flowers are divided up by color. So finding your particular flower may prove a bit tedious, because you really have to pay attention.I love my guide; I use it frequently and prefer it to a totally in-color Golden Guide I own, because it is more comprehensive and has far more information. It just takes a little patience, which is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five."
5,Easy to use,"This field guide is perfect size to take with you when exploring, searching for andidentifying wildflowers"
4,A good field guide,This is a good book for taking with you when walking. My granddaughter and I enjoy identifying the various flowers we see along the way. The book is a good size for carrying in our pockets.
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,I found this book to be of minimal use. It contains only around 20 color plates and the rest is black and white photos which do little to help identify a flower in the field.
3,WILDFLOWER BOOK POOR BINDING,"I HAVE AN OLD VERSION OF THIS BOOK THAT IS PROPERLY BOUND IE THREAD, WHICH ALLOWSONE TO USE AS FIELD BOOK AND IT WILL HOLD UPTHIS NEW VERSION IS GLUE BOUND, AND FALLS APART WHEN USED AS A FIELD GUIDE IS.DISAPPOINTEDGOOD CONTENT. BUT LOUSY CONSTRUCTION"
1,Wildflowers,I think pictures in color is a very good guide when identifying wildflowers. I was disappointed in this book.
1,Very disappointing book,This book contains mostly black and white line drawings instead of color. The section on white flowers doesn't have anything but line drawings. I don't think I will rely on Amazon reviews again. Most thought this book was great but I'll give it to the local library and look for a better one. It shouldn't be too hard to find something better.
4,Intrigue and Suspense,"I had read two other novels by Dan Fespermaan --- ""Amateur Spy"" and ""Lie in the Dark"" --- and liked them both very much, especially the latter title. ""The Prisoner of Guantanamo"" was also quite good, but it didn't grip me quite as much as the other two, plus I thought that Fesperman's prose didnt' shine quite as much, favoring storytelling over atmosphere. Nevertheless, I liked this one quite a lot. The strengths in this novel were the colorful cast of characters (although, maybe there were TOO many characters, compared to his other novels, making it hard to keep track of everyone), plus the multiple double-crossing (whose side is he on?) threads in the plot. Plenty of intrigue and suspense in this tale of espionage and politics. And of course it's all very, very relevant in this era of ""freedom fighting"" and terrorism plots. Yet another strong addition to Fesperman's catalogue of novels."
3,disppointing,"I've read Dan Fesperman's previous three novels (and completely enjoyed them) and was somewhat disappointed with ""The Prisoner of Guantanamo"". First, the plot was disjointed and complex and second, as a reader, I never felt compelled to 'root' for any of the main characters. Unlike the protagonist Vlado Petric (the first two novels) and the two main characters in ""The Warlords Son"", Revere Falk (the protagonist in The Prisoner of Guantanamo), while likeable enough just wasn't compelling for me to get too invested in. I realize that the position he was in...relative to the army, FBI, State Department etc. created conflicts for him, but I would have expected those conflicts to create a more passionate charcter."
3,Gitmo,"This is a slow-ish starter, with the personality of the key character seemingly changing mid-way as sentiment for home and family enter the story towards the end it loses some bite, but a good ride nevertheless, and interesting in light of current events in this base.One of a number of recent books that demonstrate, in the context of the story, how paranoia works, re U.S. fears of terrorists under the bedskirts."
5,"Works great, plays just like it did on the Sega","Item works surprisingly well and plays just like it did on the original console. I have had mine for over a year and have had no problems with its functionality, though the game itself can be frustratingly difficult at times."
2,No pain no gain?,"Just a heads up. I've purchased this at my local CVS because it was on sale. I just so happened to be curious and wanting to attempt to get rid of some facial hair, so of course I purchased it.Everything seemed to be legit. Put it on, wipe it off. Easy.I applied it on, thinking nothing of the minor burning following the application. I thought it would be fine! Of course it would be fine, the box says it's gentle. So let's continue on with it!!Time was up. The hair could be removed easily with a wipe, so I did. Yay, hair was off! But god, the application site sure feels painful.In the end, the area started to be red and irritated. I eventually decided to use rubbing alcohol (which stung so bad I cried) to cleanse the area. Thankfully this helped the irritation.This could all have been avoided if I just didn't purchase this item to begin with. Let's stick to wax because I'd rather be responsible for my own pain than allowing the creme to burn off a layer of skin."
1,Effective but the aftermath is horrendous,I was very effective at removing hair.. but a few days later I started having the most awful pimples (3 or 4) in that area and they got worse and worse. I am going back to waxing!
1,Where can I find it...,I have been searching for Hair Off facial hair remover..the WAX...for a long time...this was the best and only product I used for years...I can no longer find it anywhere...can you help me...it was a microwavable wax in an oblong dish...plastic...help!!!!!! my email address is bemey3@cs.com
2,Disappointed,"I have purchased this after seeing all the good reviews. However...1. When I first received the item, the front cover was completely warped to the point when you close the cover, it creates a big gap at the edges.2. There were tiny black residue of some kind all over the one I received, made the case seemed quite filthy.3. The worst part about the case I received was that it appears to be missing the magnet that triggers the smart cover feature. You can actually see and feel all other magnets, but the one that actually triggers the wake and sleep feature is missing!! you can feel the indent in the cover just underneath the microfiber interior lining.In a way I hope I just got a bad apple, but the way my case arrived - all warped and filthy made me believe that they tried to resell me a returned item from a previous customer that returned it because the case doesn't work! Will return the item and look elsewhere... =/"
3,Life post 60,Some parts of the book were okay although it definitely had a much more feminist bent to it than I would have liked. Some family situations were very real to me as I too had experience them as we'll.
2,No good quality,The lamp came with missing lock nut to hold one of the shades. Called the customer service center for hunter lighting and they in a condescendingly agreed to send a replacement. The replacement wasn't fitting well either.The positive thing is it is cheaper than getting it from a store like Rooms to Go etc.
4,heartfelt tribute,"Arthur Alexander was a great singer, capable of doing soul, pop, rock, and country tunes, and making them all sound perfectly suited to his melodic voice. This tribute album is a very pleasing one, packed with great covers of some of Arthur's most famous tunes. You might even have heard a few of these songs covered by other artists over the years. The quality of the material is obviously there, and these performances don't disappoint either. John Prine, Elvis Costello, Marshall Crenshaw ... I could go and and on. You can see the lineup of who's on here. It's as good as it looks. Go ahead and order this little gem."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I have always been happy with Kitchenaid products as they were always 'solid' products-until this one. Went to slice cheese yesterday after owning this product for the last 2 and a half years, and the thing snapped right in half. Not the slicer it's self, mind you, but the neck...the thick part...snapped right in half. Now maybe I am mistaken, but I thought something that is only ever used for slicing cheese should probably last a little longer than a couple years. To it's credit, it did work fine up until then-though as other people said, the slices are on the thick side-I just couldn't believe the whole thing snapped like that. Going with something else for the next one!"
2,Not adjustable or durable,"For such a simple device, it really missed the mark. Its not adjuatable, so you are stuck with just one thickness, which happens to be too thick for my preference. I use a slicer so I can get nice thin slices. If I wanted thick ones like this, I can just use a knife. On top of that it broke after about a year. Not getting this one again."
1,not sturdy enough,"This cheese slicer costs much more than others, but the part that holds the cutter is plastic, and it broke shortly after the manufacturer's warranty ran out. Molded plastic is not strong enough to hold a steel cutter."
2,Extremely Dull,"Each day's script must have been written on set. There are too many characters who never think, feel, say, or do anything interesting. It's a shame because 3 of the actresses seemed capable of a lot more."
3,Blessed be... a good movie!,I want the song sung by that guy but can not find it any which way... screen door jesus or Back door Jesus... I think it gets played in the ending credits... the cast was right on.. and it was one of the best religious comedies I've seen... besides The Preachers Wife.
2,Hard to get into,This movie was a hard one to keep my attention and I really had trouble getting into it.
1,wrong color,I love those scarfs they are very soft and a good size. Unfortunately I had ordered the black and white and I was shipped one that was a light green and white. I did not have the time to send it back or let anyone know. Maybe the green will grow on me.
3,For my lil cowboy,"I bought this as part of my 2 year old's Halloween outfit. He loves being a cowboy! The vest was super huge on him, so we never used it. The hat was adorable, but started coming apart pretty quickly after Halloween. I suppose it served it's purpose, but was slightly disappointed. The hat was adorable on him tho :)"
3,A Promising Resource with One Notable Shortcoming,"The idea behind this Companion is wonderful: collect into one book the texts that are referred to in the footnotes of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. This would allow readers ready access to the church documents, biblical passages, and spiritual writings related to the material in the Catechism. BUT, this Companion includes only texts which appear as indirect references, that is, those indicated by ""Cf."" in a footnote. It does not contain texts that are quoted by the catechism -- even if only a few words are quoted. This is a serious shortcoming for someone interested in studying the background sources.The book's Preface explains that it includes the texts of ""indirect references,"" but I do not think the title of the book makes this clear. The Reader should be aware of what is lacking."
4,Great for your Tool Box,"This is a great resource book for use with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. When I am doing research using the Catechism, this companion guide saves time and trouble by giving you the MANY references right at your fingertips."
5,An excellent addition to any library!,"This is actually my second copy of this volume I've owned. My first was loaned along with my First Edition Catechism and sadly never returned. The value of this book is indespensible. It expands upon the references in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) and allows you to see the full reference in its context. In doing so, you begin to appreciate the chain of thought of the original authors of the CCC, as well as begin to have a broadened appreciation for the wealth of insight that two millenia of devotion has produced.I not only highly recommend the Companion to the CCC, but it should almost be a required set for any catecumin, serious student of theology and scripture, or anyone who wants to learn with precision and depth what the true position of the Catholic Church is with regard to her doctines."
2,dogma is for me,"I've studied Catechism all through my childhood and thought this book might help me to understand. ""Understand"", you say? Yes, to understand. I, like you, am just trying to seek out the truth. I thought this book might have the answers I've been looking for to help me to truely understand Catechism. This book does make the whole pill easier to swallow, but I still don't unerstand why they make us do it. We go, we see, we do the tricks, the bells, the whistles, and they leave you so empty and unfulfilled. If your anything like me, and I know you are, Companion to the Catechism of the Catholic Church; A Compendium of Texts Referred to in the Catechism of the Catolic Church is not for you."
3,Little Richard LIVE,"Half of SONY Products GOOD GOLLY! is ""live"" performances. No original 1950s material to be found here, yet Little Richard remains compelling.PLAYLIST--Lucille (Live)MoneyJenny, Jenny (Live)Never Gonna Let You GoThe Girl Can't Help It (Live)Land Of Thousand DancesLong Tall Sally (Live)The Commandments Of LoveTutti Frutti (Live)Well"
5,A mile wide and several feet deep,"An excelent, readable, survey of the law on this topic. The greatest strengths of the book are two-fold. First, it is written in easy to follow, plain english. Second, it is amazingly comprehensive. I have been practicing employment law in two millenia, and this is the book that I use (after reviewing dozens) to teach non-lawyer classes on the topic. As with any survey book, it doesn't cover the details of the many topics it touches. You don't want to use this book to deal with comprehensive planning or an employment law dispute. But if you read this book you'll understand much of the language and many of the concerns of the experienced human resources professional or lawyer that you need."
1,Don't Bother,"I am an avid fantasy reader and I was looking for something new and fun. I looked online to see if there were any popular fantasy books/series/authors I had yet to read and Terry Brooks' ""Sword of Shannara"" was one that many people recommended. So, without even reading the jacket or checking out the first chapter, I bought the Kindle edition of the trilogy. This was probably one of the worst book purchase mistakes I have ever had the misfortune to make. The writing is bland and stilted. The characters and plot are so predictable I was out of my mind with boredom. I finished the first book wondering why on earth I had wasted my time with it, but I figured, since it was Brooks' first book, the series might get better. I was wrong. The subsequent books were just as dull and plodding. I would *not* recommend these books to anyone."
3,To heavy,This book is too heavy and thick to be enjoyable (I would guess it weights around 10-15 lbs). I would recommend that you buy the books individually.
2,Find another one...,"I recently bought the Sword of Shannara book at my local book store and figured I would give it a go. To my disappointment you never get truly involved in the story and at times I wondered if I should give up the whole book.I read the other reviews here just to see what others thought about the book and that made me write this review. I just have to say, how on earth can you give this book 5 stars!! Fanboys or what?For those of you that are considering this book, try a book by: Gemmel, Steven Erikson, Orson Scott Card, R.R. Martin, Hobb ... instead."
3,The Sword of Shannara Trilogy,"I have not finsihed reading the trilogy yet, but find what I have read interesting. I bought the trilogy to save a little money. I won't do this again. The book is so darned heavy to hold onto physically that I cannot lose myself in the story because I am trying to manipulate the weighty volume. I am not certain I will finish reading it because of this. I may try to find individual editions of each story instead. My rating is based on the physical state and has nothing to do with the story."
4,Still great!!,"This is the third time I've read the series. Still love all of Terry Brooks stories.The characters have become like old friends. I keep sharing the books andtelling friends about Shea, Flick and Allanon."
3,A shameless LOTR knock off with some redeeming features,"After getting past the LOTR ghosts hanging all over this book, I found it mildly amusing and entertaining. If I had read this book in junior high as I did LOTR, I would probably have loved it, but not so much now that I am grown. It isn't good literature and the plot is pretty weak sometimes but if you have nothing better to read, this will keep you occupied for a while. I don't think it will ever be able to stand the test of time that LOTR has, nor will I bother to read it again as I do LOTR every few years. However, if you are under 20 years old, you will likely love it."
4,Sword of Shannara is the best of the three,"The first book in the trilogy, The Sword of Shannara is in my opinion the best of the three. With Flick and Shea, and the whole supporting cast, the adventure rolls on from the very beginning when the tall dark stranger shows up.Very reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but so many these days are. Strange creatures, elves, evil creatures and an ultimate magical artifact (the sword) that everyone is trying desperately to possess.Excellent twists in the plot, some come as quite a surprise. A good fantasy for any lover of the genre, or even those who just like a good tale!!"
4,"Good Trilogy, once you get past trying to compare it with LOTR","Yes, this book has many similarities to the Lord of the Rings, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that it is a great story that is definitely worth reading. I struggled a little at times with not making comparisons, but once I got over that, I really began to see the book as its own story which was highly entertaining and and exciting for me to read. I haven't read it for a couple years and now that I got my kindle I definitely plan on purchasing it and reading it again, because it is one of the books that is worth re-reading every now and then :)"
4,Second best???,"Next to LOTR, this is probably my favorite fantasy. It is a bit much with the ""reluctant hero"" thing, but the quest and Brooks' descriptions and setting for the entire world are great.Menion is one of my all-time favorite characters. I associate with him the most.I just finished (and reviewed) The Goblin Invasion & Lord Of The Rings as well. Obviously, LOTR is magnificent, but The Goblin Invasion was a pleasant surprise. If you haven't read them, do yourself a favor!Other favs I will be re-reading on Kindle: Riverworld (unique), Xanth (the first two books!) .. and many more ..."
2,The Island of Dr Brooks,"Take a massive helping of Tolkien, sprinkle with a touch of Arthurian legend and hey presto the 'Sword of Shannara'. I couldn't get into this book at all as I had already read a much better, more dramatic version with far superior characters called 'Lord of the Rings'.I knew what would happen in this book at almost every step because it follows Tolkien's book so closely. Do yourself a favor Read 'Lord of the Rings' if you want monsters, battles and magic OR read the 'Warded Man' for a truly new fantasy experience."
3,Good escapist fantasy,"It's not Lord of the Rings, and for my money it is slightly lesser than the fantasy works of his contemporary Piers Anthony, but the Shannara books move along at a good pace with reasonably interesting characters and you can certainly do a lot worse. Not sure how well it would hold up to a second reading beyond one's teenage years but I would give it a thumbs up."
1,Terrible book,"I have a kindle and bought the trilogy which was fairly expensive for a kindle book. I purchased it based on the great reviews it had. I didn't even get through the first chapter. The author must have been a high school English teacher since it is written for proper grammar without any interest in communicating as normal people would communicate. This was so irritating to me I lost complete interest in it. No one (even fantasy characters) talk this way. I've annually read LOTR and the Hobbit and have read A song of fire and ice series from George Martin and waiting on the latest. All these were written to communicate on the level of each character based on their role but in ""The Sword of Shannara"" everyone must have graduated from Cambridge University. Take a look at the first chapter before you buy. This type of thing might not bother you."
1,not worth reading except...,...to see how closely someone could copy the Lord of the Rings and get away without being sued for breach of copyright.
2,ugggghhhhh.... extremes......,"ok, no chit chat , lemme tell you how good/ bad it is.PROS:awesome storylinescaptivating writinggood plotCONS:storylines stolen from LOTRcharacters are the sameplot is STOLEN(practically... i mean its almost the exact same things happen w/ diffrent characters...)ok, i must say that these books are awesom,e, and the reading is great!!! but for the other extreme, that is, the fact that it is greatly""influenced"" by the Lord of the Rings trilogy.(sigh)"
3,Its good but don't waste your time,"This is an ok book but it basically follows a common fantasy storyline ""a small town nobody turns out to be the only one that can save the world"" but without introducing anything new. The book just is missing memorable characters and origanal ideas you just don't get pulled into the story at all. this book may have more pages than the lord of the rings but the lord of the rings has more on the pages, so if your thinking of reading these books i would suggest just picking up tolkien it will much more worthwhile."
3,The Sord of Shannara Trilogy,The book was a gift for my son. I do not believe that he has read the entire book yet. I do know that he was disappointed in the appearance of the book becasue the binder was damaged. This was upsetting to him because he takes great pride in how he keeps his books and wants to keep them a long time.
4,Sword of Shannara Trilogy,"Great series of books, a bit of a slow read Terry Brooks is very descriptive, but the time is well worth it."
2,does not stand test of time,"Terry Brooks Shannara series was one of the first books my mom gave me to introduce me into the world of fantasy. I loved it as a young teenager. Almost 30 years later. They are a hard read. Clumbsy. The story does not flow. It fails in so many ways. But it was a stepping stone for better fantasy that follows. David Eddings, Joel Rosenberg, Lynn Flewelling, Raymond E Feist. Even Brooks became a better writer as the genre grew. So i guess its nice to see how the works of fantasy have imroved, if nothing else.I had good memories of my first read through this series, and i regret re-reading after all the years. The teenage me, did not struggle with the books. Or maybe I am just spolied by having read better books within past twenty years."
5,100% Awesome,"Seasoned fantasy fans and new fantasy fanatics (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc...) will not be disappointed by this awesome trilogy that can hold its own when compared to similar books in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.Author Terry Brooks takes you inside a world that you won't want to leave. From awesome action-packed adventure to well-crafted characters, this is a book you shouldn't pass up."
5,extremely entertainning.,the characters came to life. i love all of them.it is a MUST read! Better than the harry porter series.
4,A classic!,I have read this series of books several times over the past 20 years. Still holds up in its genre!
4,Excellent Series,Gotta love Terry Brooks! The only person I know who can take a simple sentence about a stream and put it into a full blown paragraph and make you feel like you are dabbling your toes in the water. He really pulls you into the story.
2,Still having a hard time finishing this trilogy.,"I'd grown up hearing about the Shannara series of novels by Terry Brooks, and I finally decided to give it a shot...so far it just reads like a bad rip off of the Lord of the Rings...we'll see if I ever actually finish the books. I hold out hope that something new will peak out of the mess."
3,"More wordy than it needs to be, and very predictable.","Terry Brooks takes up way too many pages describing a setting. Each book in the trilogy would be half as long if some of the fluff and filler were taken out. Also, it's extremely similar to LOTR, making it predictable to a fault."
2,Good kid's book,"I'm afraid I would have to agree with many reviewers who gave these stories a poor review. I am clearly from the wrong demographic; these stories seem to be aimed at young boys. I like fantasy, but I am not a fan of jejune writing. It's tiring to read about characters who yell when there is no need or whose voices continually trail off... And any story that has exclamation points in the text is clearly aimed at a younger crowd, the sort of reader who, had he been born many decades earlier, would have enjoyed the Hardy boys. In short, I found the stories boring and wish I had read the negative reviews here before purchasing them."
4,Meant to be similar,"Tnoyes, The Sword of Shannara was meant to be ""similar"" to LOTR. The publishing company, Del Rey, was purposely looking to start a new fantasy series that would pull in LOTR fans with a story they could be familiar with. So on that level, it was successful. Brooks gave the publisher what it wanted. An interesting note that some readers may not fully realize is that the SOS actually takes place in the future.I don't understand the problem with refering to characters by other descriptions/names at times, such as ""the giant druid"" and ""the Highlander."" Tolkien had about five different names for each character in LOTR. If you could keep it straight there, this was a piece of cake."
1,This is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I picked this up on a whim. I love fantasy Robert Jordan, Branden Sanderson, being my favorites. This is Lord of the Rings rewritten. I can't believe how many ideas he stole from Tolkien. There is nothing original here. This is awful, and boring! Waste of my time and money!"
2,Not one of the Elite Writers,"Brooks writes like one of my friends when they give me there take on a book. He does not know how to build relationships in the books. Write they talk about the past and the future and then the guy thinks he loves her. The story is ok, but there is no feeling to it."
5,"Great books, I love them.","The Sword of Shannara and the Elfstones of Shannara (have yet to read 'The Wishsong of Shannara') are great books. The crisp details of the battles, and the sharp characterization make these books great. So, it's cliche in a few places, but it's original in it's own way. It's a wild tale, and it kept me entertained for many nights. I even finished the Elfstones of Shannara in a week's time for it kept me so enthralled."
3,interesting,"I am probably being unfair but this trilogy has been surpassed in time by so many others that now has lost the relevance it may have had in the past. Its well written, contains some nice ideas and characters but loses in comparaison with so many others that, making the review today, I can only rate it with 3 stars."
3,Was worse than I remembered it,"I love many of the new Terry Brooks novels, and I remember liking this one a lot when I first read it (a long time ago). However, I recently re-read this series, and I must say, it was a bit of a disappointment. I think Terry Brooks has improved DRAMATICALLY as a writer over the years, and his first Shannara series fall quite short in comparison to his newer stuff.That being said, some people who have read the newer novels might be interested in reading it for the sake of completeness and I do think it's worth reading. Just expect to be a little disappointed.For brand new readers, I'd recommend reading some of his newer novels first. Even the next series of books by Terry Brooks (The Heritage of Shannara) is much improved in terms of writing style."
3,Sword of Shannara Trilogy,"I was very disapointed with this book as it is just a well written rip-off of Tolkien's Lord of the rings. I say well written because after I was able to get over the extreme similarity to Tolkien, I thought the story was ok. I finished two of the three stories and decided it was not to my liking to finish the third book."
3,Generally a good read,"Firstly, I want to say that I do like this book and found it an enjoyable read. However:Allinon = GandalfShea = FrodoFlick = SamwiseBalinor = AragornBrona = Sauron'Skull Bearer' = Ringwraith/NazgulNeed I say more...?"
2,What got cut,"It is nice to have all of the books in one volume. However, I was very disappointed to see that one of the maps (the the westland) was not put in the volume. The art work was also taken out. It would be better to find the books in hardback with all of the maps and all of the art work."
4,A Major Gripe,The original Brothers Hildebrandt illustrations are NOT included in this re-issue! How can they call this a 25th anniversary edition without the original art?
4,Becoming Real,This book was enlightening. We all put on a front for others because we are afraid people won't like the real us. James tells it like it is and gives us a reality check . It's time to be honest with ourselves and stop putting on a facade of perfection. Great book which hits us where we live. In the end we only have to answer to Jesus and we don't fool him for a moment.
4,What Might Have Been Might Have Been!,"The story of the ""almost"" first Spanish settlement in Florida that was overcome by a hurricane. Learning about the leaders and sponsors of this ill-fated event was eye opening."
5,Hubert Selby Jr: It/ll Be Better Tomorrow - Authentically presents THE SECRET,"I saw this film in the theater and I couldn't wait to be able to purchase it on DVD. It would've been nice to have been able to meet Cubby Selby in person - the directors, Kenneth Shiffrin and Michael W. Dean, did more than deliver a film - they create an outlet for us all to spend a moment with this unsung artist.The insight this movie gives into the world of Cubby Selby is pretty astonishing. I certainly wasn't expecting to be handed keys to his creative process while simultaneously being uplifted by the journey of this absolute spiritual being who was unapologetically human.Cause for both tears and laughter... this film will touch your heart."
1,Distasteful and Unfeeling,"I was very disappointed in this book and ended up not giving it to a grieving family. The explanation for children was distasteful to me. The comparison of insects dying anda grandparent dying was on it's face ok, but the explanation that we wouldn't want to keep grandfather's body with us as it would decay was distasteful."
5,Inspiring & Entertaining,"This is probably the most enjoyable gardening book I have ever read. Mr. James writes with such great personal charm and wit that you can't help but smile and laugh often. He writes as if he is having a cozy chat with you. Mr. Haralambou's photographs are simply beautiful. Even though parts of the book are written for beginners, and I'm an experienced gardener, my copy is studded with ""post it"" notes so I'll be able to easily turn back and find inspiration and wisdom all over again."
2,Not worth the money or time.,"I was not at all impressed with this ""Collector's Box"". It is 90% boring documentary and about 10% live video. Not what I wanted to see, and probably not worth your time or money either."
2,this is not a blacklight poster,This is a nice poster but it does not respond well to blacklight. It looks much better under white or yellow light.
1,BULLS*&T,Ordered it with the frame and never got the frame have written emails to them they said they would send me the frame still have not got it ordered it 2 months ago
4,Good and reasonable!,"I got my poster in the mail and put it in my blacklight room, It looks great during the daytime, very bright and colorful with some optical illusions, at night in blacklight it seems as if there is more going on in the picture, more stuff to see and you find a different thing each time you look, so It's very interesting, Overall good product, reasonable price and a nice size(:"
4,beautiful,"This poster gets more compliments then my daughters other posters, I will have to admit when I walk in her bedroom the poster is a eye catcher."
5,Why is one of my articles for sale on Amazon?,"I wrote this article, before I dropped my last name, Wimsatt. I used to work for the Institute of Industrial Engineers in their publications department.What the hell is my article doing on Amazon, and do I get any money from the sales of the article?These are questions that will probably never be answered."
4,Great father's day gift,My Dad needs headbands when he works so his sweat doesn't short out his hearing aids. I got these for him for Father's day and he said they work great.
4,great piece for my costume and arrived early!,I was worried I had ordered too late and it wouldn't arrive in time for my race... but it did! its a little tight but i assume it would loosen with more wear. quality was what i expected.
1,Not good,"The wire broke off as I was slicing my first slice of chedder cheese. Needless to say, I do NOT recommend this cheese slicer. Last I checked, they're supposed to last longer than one slice. Maybe mine was faulty...but regardless, I expect better."
1,does not work,"I am normally a fan of kitchen aid. This slicer has not cut a single peice of cheese since I brought it home. I've tried it on hard cheese, semi hard and soft sheese. It's really just taking up space in my utensils drawer."
5,"Detailed, thorough, enjoyable.","This book is your complete hiking guide to Virginia, whether you're a novice or a pro. There are maps, detailed descriptions of every step of the trails, elevation guides, and even colorful anecdotes from the authors that give each hike an emotional feel. We've brought their step-by-step guides to great fruition on several of the hikes, and hope to do more.One word of caution: while crowded Northern Virginia is well represented, the best hikes fall along Virginia's spine, from the northernmost part of Shenandoah National Park, down the Appalachian trail, into Washington and Jefferson National Forests and then southwestern Virginia and Mt. Rogers. Residents of Front Royal, Harrisonburg, Staunton, Lexington, Roanoke and Blacksburg will be able to access the best hikes the easiest. As residents of a DC suburb, it's an hour to Shenandoah National Park, 2 hours to some of the great hikes further south, and 6 hours to Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area."
2,a little more info than you can get on the street.,Very good information if you know nothing. Very little new information if you have talked to patients or doctors at all about cancers.
5,Love Melissa & Doug!,"Love, Love, Love it! Danica Loves it TOO! It actually works, and seems to keep my little ones attention for longer than normal! My little one is young still but we have adapted this set so it is earsier for her to use and created games associated with age appropriate things that are fun!"
1,Inaccurate description,I excitedly bought this because the product size was listed at 2 x 5.5 x 8 inches. This is not the case. These are far tinier than what I was looking for. Getting a little tired of returning Amazon's items simply because they can't give enough information or don't manage to supply accurate information.
2,Only Single Digits,"Numbers 10 through 20 are not single pieces - which is different from what's described above. There are actually 32 individual digits (plus the 5 math signs):3 pieces of number 012 of number 13 of number 22 of numbers 3-9.The odd digits are either green or yellow, and even digits are red or blue (Except ""1"" pieces which also come in red and blue, apparently to be used for the even teen numbers).My set seems to have a green 1 that should be yellow to make for a nice color pattern (red, green, blue, yellow) from 0-20. Instead the number 19 has a green 1 and yellow 9.But it seems somebody thought the color scheme through, so maybe I just got an off set."
4,Good...could be better...,"I bought these for my granddaughter -- who's at the stage of putting everything in her mouth. :) The numbers (like the letters and animal shapes) are glued-on paper, and will come off if chewed on sufficiently.A better solution would be a non-toxic paint, I suppose.... but I'm not sure the added cost of the painting would then justify the cost. An easier solution is to teach the child not to chew on everything in sight. :)So, these are better (much better) than the Chinese-made stuff .... and I *do* recommend them, with the afore-mentioned caveat."
5,Wonderful learning tool,"I love these numbers because they are very durable and they grow with the child. Hopefully we don't lose them because I love the fact that as my child ages, they can also be used for addition, subtraction, and multiplication!"
1,"I usually like Melissa and Doug toys, but...","I unwrapped this for my daughter and within minutes the labels on the magnets were falling off. Instead of letting her play with them right away, I had to go through all of them and glue the labels on that were falling off. Very disappointing. I usually don't have these issues with Melissa and Doug toys."
5,Listen to this soul stirring singing by Sam Cooke,Sam Cooke is a great legend. He sings with such an anointing. He feels what he sings and that is what makes this album a great one. I just get chill bumps when I hear him sing because he has a sweetly anointed voice. If you want to be sung to sleep physically or spiritually this is the perfect CD.
4,much truth is said in fiction !,I WAS IN THE 196TH L.I.B. THE PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN FICTIONAL MUCH OF THE STORY WAS NOT!
5,Great Novel on Vietnam,"This is a frist rate novel; page turning. A novel about honor and caring. This novel we see a unique side to the army and Vietnam. We see the inner workings of the 3rd US Inf, the Army's Old Guard, which is the unit responsible for Arlington Cemetary and Burial Details. The Nations Premier Honor Guard and the Presidents Own. This book is for everyone. We will see the enthusiam and innocence of youth in the '60s. Those young men who wanted to go and fight for their country. Worried the war would end before they could get there and help the US win. To the reality the soldier's who had allready been there wake up to, knowing we could not win the war the way it was being waged."
2,"this has been released before as ""Tina Goes Country""","If you have the ""Tina Goes Country"" this is the same album just with a different cover. It is ok as a novelty, but if you truely like Tina this may not be for you."
4,Part 2 of a great set,"A companion disc to Specialty's ""The Georgia Peach"". The big hits are on that CD; this disc gathers some lesser 45s along with some alternate takes of the hits. ""The Georgia Peach"" is the essential Little Richard CD; this one is less important but certainly quite enjoyable. Nice booklet, great sound. Rockin'!"
2,Elastic too tight,I ordered this pair of slippers and the hole for the foot on one of them had such tight elastic that I couldn't even stretch the slipper into a flat position (like in the pic) - It would stay curled up from being too tight. I exchanged them for another pair but had the same problem. There was really no way to get my son's foot in it properly.
5,Six stars,"Rubinstein in his prime and Hofmann slightly over the hill, but his hill is a mountain. Buy it - it's fantastic."
3,meh,"The condition I received mine in was less than great. The bolts that hold it together were all loose and one was actually completely out. It also had alot of minor scratches on it somehow. After I tightened it up properly its was a great solid knife. Worth the money for sure, but not any more..."
5,A Prayer for God's Ears,"Hearing Fairouz's supplication to God for mercy on His people, enlightenement and forgiveness will move you to tears. Her voice is sweet, pure and solitary."
5,"stunning, for listening during lent","I played this cd at my church this year, and everyone was very moved. Fairouz at her best. ""El Yom Ollika"" (Today He Was Hung) is one of the most intense pieces of music I have ever heard, in any genre. This album is a treasure, an overwhelming work from one of the 20th century's great artists."
3,Not the normal Hunter quality,"I was skeptical because of the price. This fan carries the Hunter name, but definitely not the Hunter quality we have become accustomed. Cheaper hanging mechanism than others which allows the fan to tilt. Does not move the amount of air as other Hunter fans we own. Would not reccomend."
5,Perfect outdoor fan,"This is a great fan; it is quiet and moves the air well outside. I have it in an open pergola; it just survived a hurricane and is working beautifully. The blades look like wood, not plastic, which I thought important."
1,Poor design makes assembly difficult,"This might be a great fan if I could ever have gotten it properly assembled. Since it is UL ""wet"" rated, there is a lot of rubber gasketing in and around the points of assembly. The problem is that the screws provided are too short to accomodate the extra thickness of the rubber gasketing when making the assembly. This will be returned for a refund."
5,Hunter Fans are the best!!,"Hunter 23566 Sea Air 52-Inch 5 White Plastic Blades Ceiling Fan, WhiteThe Hunter brand cannot be beat. We use this in an outdoor (ceiling) environment. This purchase was a replacement for one that lasted 17yrs., and was only replaced because the last one was damaged by a storm. Hunter fans last and last, and are a great value for the money paid."
1,Disappointing,"The reason we did not purchase a ceiling fan from the local home improvement store (for half the price of this fan) is because I wanted something that didn't look cheap. The Hunter fan is quiet and the motor and blade brackets appear as pictured. However, the plastic wood-look fan blades look cheap. It is bad enough they are plastic, but the manufacturer's attempt to make plastic look like something produced by mother nature was a total failure. If my husband didn't already hang it, I would be packing it up for return right now."
1,Right packaging but wrong contents.,"I don't know who's fault it is but i always get this product, either from the body shop store or amazon. This is my first time ordering from this seller and i am disappointed because when i opened it, the color of the body butter was almost white rather than orange, and the scent smelled awful and different from what i know to be true. The texture is also very lotion like rather than thick and creamy."
1,Not as advertised,I know what Satsuma products are supposed to smell like. THIS IS NOT IT. I opened the Body Butter this morning and it smells like chemicals. Nothing like what I have already.I am returning it. The body lotion that came from another seller in the same package smells as it should. I think the seller may have stored the body butter in an unairconditioned facility as it is ruined apparently.
1,Full of Parabens. Want a little breast cancer with this lotion ?,"The Body SHop is one of the last companies not to reformulate their products without Parabens. Even Estee Lauder and others have done it with their products. For The Body Shop to pretend it is so ""natural and healthy"" is a joke, especially as this stuff is easily absorbed through your skin. So many better, and safer alternatives."
1,Terrible,Misread the bottle tho0ught this was the newer gel stled shaving cream wife hates it as it does not stay in place when she applies it to her legs.
5,"clever, timeless sci-fi classic","Invader on my back was recommended to me as a book that once begun, would be hard to put down.It did not disappoint. Cleverly written, it is a quick read, but very thought provoking. The play onwords and names really makes you think once you've completed the story."
1,Smart Exercise,"This video is the worst waste of money I ever spent. I have the book ""Smart Exercise"" which is very informative and excellent coverage of the latest technical info on the subject. However, the video is presented for idiots--few charts and some silly remarks! DON'T BUY THE VIDEO! I have called Covert and let him know what I think."
5,Best historical I've read in a LONGGG Time!,"Marsha Canham is a new author for me and after reading the Iron Rose I am on an eager hunt for her backlist. The Iron Rose has everything I love in a good historical - wonderful characters (not only the main h/h but the secondary characters too), descriptive writing, spicy heat between the h/h. I highly recommend this novel."
3,I enjoyed this one but a lot like the first one,The interaction between the main characters is great. I love the friction and the battle descriptions. I think it was a bit repetitive of the first book in terms of plot so won't read another in this series.
5,Outstanding swashbuckler of a tale!,"One of the best books I've ever read. I could not put it down. Ms. Canham's writing is descriptive, and her characters fully formed (as if I actually knew them). Her writing of battling ships was very thorough and descriptive. This is a winner!"
4,fun read,"Light, fun read takes you away from reality and into a world of adventure; characters well defined, author makes you believe the story."
3,Mmm... Still good!,"I bought this edition, because I thought it would be better, what's more, I thought it would be many little gifts go with them. But when I got it, I felt it was not so different from the odinary edition. I was a little disappointed. However, the songs in this album were very good. I love ""Happy Birthday, Princess"" and ""If you can dream"" very much. I was so excited that this album featured a lot of my favourite lady vocals such as Jodi Benson's and Lea Salonga's. How I wish they will be young forever and sing more new songs of Disney Princess'! And I hope that Disney will record more albums like this one."
5,My daughter loves it,"This cd has had a lot of playtime. I'm tired of it, however my 5 year old daughter is not. We had borrowed the library copy many times prior to my purchasing this copy. She listens to it daily."
4,Super cute for your princess!,What a great CD for little girls (and big girls) to enjoy! My daughter loves the songs and I even find myself singing along. Great for any princess!
1,Giant Ad for the Boeing 787,"I am an Aviation Nut and was first attracted to this movie at a local 3D display to sell 3D TVs. I was impressed with the excerpts and shots of the glider. I bought the movie and start following the story. It's not about legends; it's about bringing the Boeing 787 to life. The technical content is lame and disjointed. Unrealistic shots of Computer Animated Airplanes plague the movie. Gimmicky 3D wire animations models are shoved at the audience for the sake of 3D and not telling the story. Even as a documentary of telling the Boeing 787 story, it lacks real character and feeling. Leave this Blu-Ray/DVD on the shelf."
1,Very Disappointing,"When I saw this in theaters, I was hoping to see some kind of documentary discussing classic aircraft. Instead what I got was an advertisement for the new Dreamliner, which included Boeing ridiculing other aircraft designers. Do not waste your money with this film."
1,if you love Airplanes...better look out your window........,"One thing I never understood about this Imax production is ..... Why if you have the real planes.... you use Cgd ones for the flight sequences ??, you miss the real stuff these legendary machines carry in them, the noise, the rivets,the cgd's are so perfect they lack....... LIFE ¡¡¡, no better than watching a NASCAR race on Disney's Cars movie ¡¡¡¡"
2,disappointed,Not nearly what it was advertised to be. Just an infomercial under an assumed name. overpriced at that.Would not have ordered it if I had been able to preview. Had nothing todo with the history of flight which is what the title led me to believe it contained.
1,One of the most boring movies I've ever seen,"With a title like ""Legends of Flight"" one would expect, well, LEGENDS of flight - something like a history of aviation and/or great aviators with exciting tales of daring and adventure. Instead, this is basically a really long commercial for Boeing and their new 787. Admittedly the 787 is a marvel of engineering and might indeed be a game-changing airplane, but that could be said of countless other aircraft and hardly any of them, including this one, would be a fitting subject for a movie/commercial like this one. I rarely walk out of a movie, but three hours into this 42 minute commercial were all my wife and I could take."
4,Great way to show off the 3D television.,"While I agree that this would serve very well as the intro video prior to an Airbus or Boeing factory tour, the 3D flight scenes are fantastic. There is clearly a blend, seamless, between true IMAX video and CGI. I have issues with parralax and the only time there was a problem was during the intro credits and a few scenes shot of a boardroom with the manufacturing facility reflecting on the glass between the meeting and the camera. I tend to close one eye during these shots since a focus for me is out of the question. The shot of the glider soaring through the mountains sold me, and it's only one of many shots that make the production an experience over just being a 3D gimmick."
5,"Exceptional Blue-Ray, 3D DVD",Beyond words!. That's what I felt when viewing this DVD. I highly recommend it to anyone with 3D and Active glasses
3,pleasantly pleased with the 3d,"Granted,I saw this free on my 3d ""on demand"" cable ,but from the reviews I wasn't expecting much.I'm not into airplanes at all,but I am into 3d and I actually thought the 3d was good.Even the factory scenes were good,a little ghosting but not bad.I'm going to buy the dvd and add to 3d collection,it has a good price and because the 3d was good I actually enjoyed it.I am one of the few here who enjoyed it,plus its short,not to long."
4,Awesome 3d effects!!,"I recently rented this docu/narrative and that part of this might not be that interesting to a lot of people but,,,, for the 3d part for home viewing it is well worth a look. Wings will come right out into your lap. There are also a lot of computer graphic drawings and such which project 3d images and the 3d is pretty constant thruout. This is the one you want to watch if you are getting it solely for the 3d effects. I only give this 4 stars because Im only reviewing because of the 3d and not for the story. If I was only rating for 3d I might give it 5* the story maybe only 2*."
2,Should have been titled 'The Boeing 787 Saga',"The title 'Legends of Flight' gives the impression of great aviators: Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh, Chuck Yeager, etc.This film is basically the story of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner from conception to first test flight. Most of the action takes place in the Boeing assembly plant. On screen design graphics are pretty dazzling, but it was a real disappointment that all the 'bird-in-flight' footage was animation, and not too great animation at that. I've seen other films where actual birds were shown in flight, with stunning results.The 787 is a beautifully designed aircraft, but not worth an entire IMAX film.NOTE: I did NOT view the 3D home version, which might have been a much better viewing experience. I saw this at an IMAX Theater where the picture is in front, sides, and on top of you - not the best viewing experience at all."
3,good but not like in theater...,"Saw this documentary in theater in Washington DC and I'm a big fan of Boeing engineering and products. The most I liked - the 3D effect, it was incredible, things were rotating above our heads in the room. Ever since (a year ago) I wanted this documentary in my personal collection. Have to say I was a bit disappointed when I watched it on my 3D tv. The effect is not the same, it's ok but not like in theater. Maybe I should try sitting a little closer to tv screen? Other than that, excellent video quality and a nice story of building the dreamliner (B787)."
2,IMAX: No longer commercial free,"This review is of the content only. The title is misleading because the film has scant little historical information.Basically, what you're buying is a 40-minute long Boeing commercial."
1,"still not received my package, denounce this","and spend too much time, and still not receive my package nor I receive any tracking number. desire the return of money"
2,Sell-out,"Saw this at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago last summer. It was slightly enjoyable. It seems like Boeing partnered heavily with the museum to create this as a giant Imax advertisement. I come from a family full of aviators, both military and private sectors. It's in our blood, and this certainly didn't speak to any professional level, or really delve terribly deep into the origins of flight which is a fantastic story in itself. The CG was lame, and the overall presentation was cheesy and loose."
1,Unwatchable,"The video quality of the transfer is absolutely poor: blacks turning to blue, misaligned frames, and obvious scratches and dust."
2,Misleading title,"This is really the story of developing the B-787 Dreamliner and a cheesy one at that. If you have DTV you can see it for free on one of their 3D channels. Save your money, don't buy this."
2,CGI,"If you like watching real aircraft then don't buy this. Can't understand why the movie industry is going for so much CGI stuff these days. I want to watch real aircraft and real aircraft sounds, not some cartoon. While the scenes are visually stimulating, who cares? You can make anything look good on a computer. Even though the movie is basically an advertisment for Boeing, it would have been so much better if they spent a little money and got some air-to-air footage. Seems like no one cares about doing anything real anymore. Flying an aircraft with you're own two hands is a whole lot different than flying some electrons across a computer screen."
4,Nice promo with great animation and video,"Video was delivered on time.Video itself is more or less a Boeing promotion film for the 787. Despite that, it shows beautiful animation, although the glider wings were quiet bend too much, a bit unrealistic. Nice transfer with music and introduction to the Paris Airshow, etc. Overall nice story with fantastic landscape video."
2,Not exactly as advertised,"More or less a Boeing 787 Dreamliner commercial, although a few soaring scenes that showcase the 3 D effects.Maybe this DVD should be re-titled, since it is a bit misleading?"
1,Worst Movie ever,"Nothing but a Boeing commercial. Boring, Stupid and a total waste of time. Wish I had my money back. All about Boeing trying to out do Air Bus."
2,Disappointed,Disappointed in the content...mostly design engineering drawings and engineering drafts with closeup photos of airplane exteriors and interiors. Family and friends did not get much out of it and the 3D experience was not good for anyone.Unless you are in the business or have a hobby of designing large aircraft this is not for you..If you are wanting to show off your new 3D TV and system look elsewhere.
2,It's like paying for Boeing's advertising,"Short on substance, lots of self-conscious handwringing about the B787, hardnosed opinions about the Airbus, and unnecessary graphics effects, e.g., cutting through a 3D-rendered body of the plane. The overwrought comparisons of the B787 to the albatross are maudlin. ""Legends"" suggests that it is an overview of aviation's best, but is anything but."
4,Attention Grabber!,"I received this item off of a wishlist I had created for graduation and I love it. The picture can be a tad misleading because the Citrine is actually very, very light (like a watered-down apple juice) but it's still pretty.Every time I wear it, without fail, people always stop to tell me how much they like it. It makes your hands look very delicate and feminine, which is nice the ring is a nie weight and size: it's not to bulky and it doesn';t have a tendency to catch on things.I give this ring 4.5 out of 5 because the picture is misdleading, but otherwise it ROCKS!"
2,not as it looks in the pic,"the product looks great in the pic, but actually it is toooo small and the material looks cheap and you can bend it with your 2 fingers."
4,"Empathy, Voice Drive this Road Trip!","In Long Gone Daddy, the author beautifully captures the conflicts, impulses, and humor of adolescence. Trapped in a difficult family, Harlan Q wishes only for escape and finds a window of opportunity in a cross-country trek to return his grandfather's remains to Las Vegas. What I liked most about the novel is the voices of the characters and the empathy we feel for them--even the difficult ones--thanks to Ms. Hemphill's writing. I highly recommend this book--as well as her historical ""road trip"" book, The Adventurous Deeds of Deadwood Jones, for any pre-adolescent or adolescent readers. Adults, too!"
4,Sizing,"Xl size is misleading, it is a American medium size. Quality is very good. Haven't washed it yet to see if color fades."
2,Not what I expected,"The description of this book is deceptive. The book merely goes over numerous topics lightly and barely goes into detail at all when the reader really wants it. An example is the animal on the cover that you are suppose to learn how to create, the book skips almost all the steps. To basically sum it up it says, ""Make a sphere, extrude from curve, model the details."" Waist of money."
4,a good place to start,"This book is nice to have handy considering the limited number of XSI books out there. While the treatment as a whole can be kind of overview-ish at times, Mr. Isner manages to get into some nice technical tid-bits that can be hard to find other places. A good place to start for someone who knows some 3D, but wants to learn the XSI methodology."
4,pokemon the johto journeys tough enough,"I think this was a good book because of the Pokemon and they caught many other Pokemon. The characters in this book are in a magical land called Johto. The characters are Ash,Misty and Brock.A boy and his friend have adventures. The boy's name is Ash and his friends' names are Misty and Brock. My favorite character is Ash because he has some cool Pokemon powers. There are battles for badges. In these battles the characters battle gym leaders.I would recommend this book to my friends ages 10-12 because this is a fantastic book. I would recommend this book to friends who like adventure books."
5,football cards,"My son really liked the complete set of football cards. It is a great gift, and one that we will be buying every year!"
5,great book,"This book(and the rest in the series) are all great. The best books that I have ever read. Once you read one, you have to read all of them, they are as addicting as chocolate and just as good too. There is the perfect amount of romance, suspense, and mystery. I have read all of them repeatedly. Great books."
2,MORE VULGAR THAN FUNNY,"The stalking that Charlie (Steven Roy) does was not done in a humorous fashion. His sabotage of his ex-girlfriend's relationship was more disturbing than humorous. Mallory (Josie Maran) appeared to be as dysfunctional of Charlie, and outside of her looks I failed to see the attraction.Charlie gets a new girlfriend, one that would make me forget Mallory and quite a bit more. Charlie's friend Nick (Sean Marble) is one of those guys which women in real life hate, but in the movies, they love. Clare Kramer, as Charlie's boss gave us the best performance in the movie, but not good enough to carry it. I thought Josie Maran really sucked in this one, although the script never gave her any clever lines or personality, she failed to create one."
2,Took a while to finish,"I got this movie because Clare Kramer was in it (Buffy the vampire killer fame) and she ended up to play a very small part as an office manager. The movie is about a jealous male stalking his x. Just the kind of movie I did not want to watch, but I painfully finished the movie off and it will go on the shelf in back where I will probably never see it again."
3,"OK, but disappointing for experienced dog owners","If you already own a dog and have given them any sort of obedience training, most of this book is either irrelevant or redundant to what you probably already know. Mr. Kilcommons essentially gives you tips on how to have a well-behaved dog, then applies those lessons to having children in the house. While these are important lessons, his approach is neither unique nor revolutionary. And this is a teeny tiny book! Barely 80 pages, I read it in less than an hour, skimming much of the early sections (choosing the right dog for you, whether to adopt a puppy or an older dog etc. - chapters completely irrelevant for someone who's trying to train the dog they already HAVE rather than the one they don't own YET.) It wasn't a bad book, but there were very few tips that I will find useful in introducing our dogs to our soon-to-arrive child."
4,Very good book!,"We bought this to help us train our two newly rescued rat terriers to accept our grandchildren. They had some very good advice on introducing dogs to children, etc. that we have already used. Hopefully, by the time they visit, they will be more socialized to children.The reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars is just that it's very short and concise. I still had some unanswered questions after reading it, but so far, it has the most information in one book on this issue that I've seen."
1,Not much advice for a good dog or actual child-proofing,"It didn't take long for me to realize I could skim most of this book. I have a well behaved female boxer, and was looking for advice for preparing her for baby. Agree with the other review I read - didn't need 5 out of the 7 chapters since she is already well trained (no formal training was ever needed). Of the 2 chapters that might help, I won't actually know until after I have the baby. There's little advice for prepping your dog - much of it is advice for how to fix an existing or developed problem, not avoiding them altogether (like licking baby's face or eating diapers - no advice for how to avoid... just how to fix if you see it happen). Several chapters are for later years and ""training"" your kids - - I don't need that advice - i need to know how to PREP my dog for baby. Will definitely be looking for another more helpful book."
4,A must have for new parents with dogs,"This book is a must have for parents expecting their first child with a dog in the home. We have a very hyper and loveable lab mix mut. We were concerned that he would barrel over our child and destroy her toys. This book does a good job of training the dog owner on how to behave, and has great techniques to work with the dog before bringing baby home. Our baby is now 20 months old and loves her dog. He has never chewed on her toys or given us a reason to feel uncomfortable. Not to say he isn't still hyper, he is, but he knows to avoid her. She is able to love on him, take his toys, and pet him. He behaves beautifully. He always barrels through the back door, and she gets such a kick out of it that she stands in the middle of the doorway and lets him blow past her while she giggles at him. I have recommended this book to all of my friends with dogs that are expecting a new baby."
1,Doesn't live up to it's title,"This book is very superficial and is fine unless you are actually having a problem with your dog. If you have a problem, the author just recommends getting professional help. If you are really interested in dealing with potential problems between your dog and children, I recommend ""The Dog's Mind"" by Bruce Fogle."
5,Works,"These work, they get rid of tapeworms. That's all I need from these pills, is that they get rid of the worms quickly."
5,AMAZING product,"When I realized that my pup had a tapeworm (or tapeworms) (after seeing white segments of the broken off tapeworm in his feces and internet research), I was mortified. I read reviews about different meds and picked this up at the local pet store for a much higher price. I gave for tablets to my dog in the evening (around 7 p.m.). After a bowel movement the following morning, there were no traces of tape worm segments and there haven't been any traces since before taking the medicine. I know that other reviewers said it took about one to two days, but it worked very quickly for my pup and for that, I am incredibly grateful. He didn't experience any of the possible side effects. I cannot comment on this particular seller and I hope that my dog doesn't become reinfected (I've vacuumed repeatedly since giving him the meds), but I would buy this product again if he did."
5,Fantastic!,"Tapeworm treatment from the vet was going to cost $50-70 for my 120 pound dog. Tapeworms do not respond to most products so they are harder to get rid of than most intestinal parasites. This stuff was new on the market and had good reviews so I took and chance and it worked beautifully! Fantastic stuff, I recommend it to anyone."
4,Good Product,"After much research i picked this product. It works great. i have to give my dog 2, but they seem to last for months."
5,Easy to use- do it yourself and save,"We worm our dogs 2x a year with these and Nemex to conquer all the worms a dog could get! No issues, easy to use and affordable instead of going to Vet and doing the ""monthly preventative""!"
4,Worm killers,"Came on time and I know it works well. I ordered these for my cat as I get 5 tablets in this bottle where you only get 3 in the cat bottle. My cats are hunters of mouses and always end up getting worms and the weight of my cats requires 2 tablets of the the cat pills. With this, I only need 1 tablet per treatment. So this is better for my budget, I get 5 tablets in the dog wormer bottle instead of the 3 in the cats wormer bottle. I now have 5 treatments per bottle with this instead of 1 1/2 treatments per bottle of the cat wormer bottle. Great Deal.Would order again."
2,Not necessarily right for purpose,"I have a Labrador and wood floors and the soft claws do not improve the relationship. It has been a bit like tap shoes for a child at Christmas.The claw guards went on fine and have stayed on (I was rather hoping that they would fall off, I am going to find out today how to take them off).The plastic of the claw guard is softer than keratin of claws and without sharp edges so if scratching was the primary issue it might be a help.However putting a cap on anything is going to make it longer and for these it is a minimum of 4 mm. Immediately Abby made more noise on the floor and I think she was also getting even less traction on the floor than before. The Soft Claws were just not soft enough to be helpful. She sounds like a walking snare drum.The best answer is going to be weekly nail sanding.Abby did get 2 complements on how good her nails looked including ""you've had Abby's claws done"" ie it look almost natural. (The ones I got were NOT purple.)"
2,HMMM,"we have an 80lb lab and wood flooring in the house, hence the need for these little nylon caps. Fairly easy to put on but if your dog spends any time outside they will only last a couple of weeks. We have a pool decking that just wore them down to where the original nail was exposed after a couple of weeks. Then after a couple more weeks he had lost 1/2 of them.Probably better suited for smaller dogs that spend all day inside."
1,A rip-off in pure KISS fashion,"Folks, 99% of this book is pictures of Kiss merchandise. Unless you want to pay good money to look at hundreds of pages filled with pictures of toys and magazine covers, save your dough. KISSTORY I is excellent, KISSTORY II is an absolute rip-off. Gene always seems to come up with new ways to suck the money out of your pocket, and this one is a classic. I've been a KISS fan since 1976 and will remain one until I die (no, I'll not be buried in a KISS Kasket) so trust me. This book is for two kinds of people - those who have tons of money to burn and nothing to burn it on, and those who feel they must have EVERYTHING that has the KISS logo stamped on it."
2,Doesn't stack up to KISSTORY I,"I finally received my copy of Kisstory II last week. I thought it would be a little more informative.Although I liked it, this book is far less enjoyable.The band could have at least signed it.The wait was over a year! They could have added the last few years(95-present) of the band. I just think that they didn't put enough thought into this book. It should have cost less for it's content.This coming from a fan of seventeen years. Buy only if your a die-hard!"
1,A Cash Grab,"This book is not nearly as good as it's predecessor. Actually, it kinda sucks. Photo quality is not very good. It is strictly a scrapbook of merchandise that either was sold by the band or merchandise that never made it to production. Yeah, it's interesting to see... once. That alone makes it not worth the price. Find a sucker that bought it and look at his for 20 mins... that should be plenty."
3,missed some good music from other projects,"This compilation is fine, especially the first half, but fans of Maceo Woods and The Christian Tabernacle Choir know that later albums were also good. I miss from this collection, ""Satisfied,"" ""Jesus when trouble Burdens me down,"" ""Through it all,"" ""Hallelujah,""...etc. I'm thankful however to find anything at all from Maceo Woods on CD. Doris Sykes version of ""The Name of Jesus"" still sounds as refreshing today as it did when ""Hello Sunshine"" was released back in the early seventies. It is amazing that none of Ms. Sykes songs ever appear on anthologies or compilations (as far as I can tell) of gospel music. Gospel sopranos like her, Sara Jordan Powell and others blessed so many with their beautiful voices. On ""Hello Sunshine,"" Rev. Maceo Woods and The Christian Tabernacle Choir often touches us where many gospel groups fail to these days, and that is in our heart and soul."
1,Warning - this are *not* the original song recordings!,"Hidden in find print on the bottom of the box, under the ""Made in Canada"" and the copyright info and mailing address for the manufacturer, is the following disclaimer: ""This album may contain re-recorded tracks. All single artist tracks are performed by the original artist. Tracks featuring groups were recorded using as many of the original group members as possible.""Buyer beware!"
1,Once again I got bit.,"Saw the titles listed on this product and I just had to have them. Got home from the P.O. and what an unpleasant surprise! All tracks phoney, done by cover bands! Amazon, when are you going to get rid of this junk that infects you fine website?"
3,Not what I wanted,"I was surprised to see this transfer switch as one of the recommended choices because it didn't have the amount of breakers I needed for my generator. The quality looked fine,but it didn't match my needs. I returned I without a problem from Amazon."
4,"Was innitially concerned, but I love it now.","When I recieved this grease/gravy seperator, I was very concered since the upper part of the strainer did not fit very tightly inside the container. I thought that it would not do a good job of seperating with it so loose. However, this was not the case. It did a great job, and was really easy to wash compared to those that have one-piece spouts.Just a tip though, after filling the container, let it sit still for several minutes to allow the grease to rise to the top before pouring the good juice from it.I would still like it better if the insert fit more tightly, so giving a 4 star instead of 5."
5,Unsurpassed Illustrations,"Without detracting from an otherwise well researched & written book, the awesome artwork in this book is worth the price tenfold. Best illustrations anywhere on the subject."
5,Excellent product !,"The Pro Power Photo & Video Bag keeps my Canon Digital Camera PowerShot S5 protected. It has enough room for the Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash, the Sony quick battery charger, a set of extra batteries, and other itens, like a set of filters and conversion lens adapter. The quality of this product and the price makes it a very good choice."
5,great case for the price,this case is very sturdy. has traveled all over the country with us. i love the extra room it has because I fit both my cameras into it as well as battery chargers and cords. it is simple and when needed it fits easily into a backpack and diaper bag.
5,fishing mask,I received all 3 masks in good order. They fit like a glove and keep my face nice and warm. I would recommend to anyone who fishes hunts or just spend time outdoors.
2,"Liked the movie, hated the tape of it",I liked the movie but this copy of the tape is so bad you can't watch it. The only good thing about this purchase is the cost. It was next to nothing.
3,different than expected,"I've read the book first and was curious to see the movie. Well, the story is completely different I would say. It's not bad, just I expected the movie to be based on the book. The book was better!"
4,Great BUT,It would be super nice if it was adjustable. I think the slices of cheese are a little to thick.but I still love it!
5,Cryptics for the American solver,"These cryptics are excellent for the solver who does not dwell in the abstruse depths of the English language. The structural ingenuity is very good, and the ""tricks"" are usually quite fair. The whole series of Henry Hook' cryptics is to be recommended -- but not for beginners."
3,The Byzantine Empire,"It was interesting for the person wanting to read about this time period, but sometimes it was hard to follow the timeline of events."
3,Honest Kiss,"By the people for the People. An interesting glimpse into fan worship, and the let downs it sometimes brings. People can really make you laugh."
1,Save Your Money!!,"Save your money, this is one of the worst videos I have seen.To sum it up.This DVD is nothing more than a glorification of some of the worst looking and sounding Kiss tribute bands I have ever seen.Nothing to do with Kiss except for a few people who didnt recieve the attention they would like from Kiss.As for the guy who thinks he looks like Ace Frehley, dream on.Maybe Ace hasnt contacted you since you sold off many one of a kind Kiss collectables so you could buy Elvis memorabilia.As for the sorry little kid who made a plaque for Paul Stanley.The real sorrow story is that the parents thought that spending $100.00 and using the face of thier kid was going to get them some sort of special attention from Paul.They got exactly what they deserved for exploiting thier kid, nothing."
2,Parasites,"During the opening credits, I noticed that the company that produced this dull, low budget affair is called ""8th Grade Productions"" -- little did I know how apt a name that would be. This cheap, exploitive, bottom-of-the-barrel documentary somehow manages to make being a KISS fan seem boring and more than a tad pathetic. Think ""Trekkies"" with a third of the budget and none of the amusing ""characters"". Zzzzzzz......"
1,Don't waste your money,"Horrible production quality. If you are buying this for the ""freak"" factor, don't waste your money. You will come away feeling dirty and ashamed for wasting 90 minutes of your life on this garbage."
1,Not that great,"If you like watching how KISS (or Star Trek..for that matter) Conventions are put together; behind the scenes, etc. than this is for you. Basically just another unofficial product, with no copyrights to music or likeness, so buyer beware."
4,Helpful book,"Overall this book is a good compilation of some of the nutrition/mood research available. Most of what I read, I've read elsewhere, but it was nice to have it summarized in one source. I don't agree with some of her opinions (she's an advocate of the Atkins diet and is adverse to vegetarian diets), but most of her advice is good.As other reviewers mentioned, she definitely needs a good editor. Her self-promotional, dogmatic, repetitive writing style detracts from the book's content.This book can be very helpful, but I'd encourage people to read other research to derive a more balanced perspective."
3,Online alternative,"Those wary of purchasing this book, but generally interested in the nutritional treatment of depression and anxiety, may want to check out www.TheWayUp.com. The Way Up from Down, a book by Priscilla Slagle, is similar in theme and general info to The Mood Cure, but it isn't plagued by as many of the problems other reviewers cite in Julia Ross's work. Slagle posted her book online for free, so at the very least it's worth a look. The website seems partly designed to sell supplements, but the book itself is relatively free of specific promotions."
4,Great info!,"I have made it a point to avoid antidepressants and other mood meds, because of the side effects. I try to stick with natural treatments. This book was invaluable in helping me learn how amino acid supplementation can get our brains back on track. I can't believe how well I sleep with L-tryptophan! Be careful about getting off your meds, if you're already taking them. Please do so under medical supervision. But if you're not on meds, or want to avoid having to take them, please read this book and give it a try. It can change your life."
1,Buy Something Else. ANYTHING Else!,"I'm a self-help junkie and at age fifty-eight, have read just about everything out there. So I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This book is useless. I read through it, shook my head and handed it to my husband. He skimmed it and gave it to our daughter, a PhD candidate in Psychology. She said it was . . . I can't print what she said.Please don't bother. The book is just plain bad. It's now in our recycling bin. It's not even worth trying to re-sell, and I don't want to waste anyone else's energy by giving my copy to them."
5,Loved this!!!,This book changed my life! Having experienced both hormonal fluctuations and adrenal gland failure finding a homeopathic cure to rebalancing my system was the greatest blessing. I actually purchased several copies and sent them to friends! Thank you for writing this!!! Love it!!!
3,Very Helpful Information,"This book was full of helpful information about nutrition, supplements, and mood health. I tried most of her suggestions in an attempt to help depression following Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. At first I felt miraculous, but after a couple of weeks, the supplements didn't help anymore and even caused me to be anxious and angry. I stopped the supplements and am back to where I started.Due to the CFS, I have problems with many supplements and drugs after a few weeks. However, the amazing progress I had at first makes me think the recommendations in this book could really help people."
5,Very interesting!,I found this to be a very interesting read. It is interesting how the food you eat affects you and your mood. Good samples of what to eat - or not - if you have a problem.
3,Interesting but did not work for me,"This book proposes that changes in diet and nutritional supplements can eliminate four types of ""false moods"": a dark cloud, blahs, stress, or too much sensitivity. Admittedly, the author provides a fairly convincing argument to support her diet deficiency theory. It's not even that difficult to apply the dietary suggestions to yourself. However, I tried the suggestions for two months and didn't notice any improvement in my blah moods. So to me, this book is blah! Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
4,Good information for people diagnosed with thyroid problems,"More information on how to deal with Hashimoto's Disease than anywhere else including my Doctor who just keeps testing my blood every six months and writing me a prescription for some version of Synthroid. There is some good information on how to break an addiction to sugary stuff. The author doesn't pull any punches. She states clearly it take at least ten weeks. She is also a good fan of eggs: ""The only thing wrong with them is people don't eat enough of them."" Contrary to some of the negative reviewers the author doesn't advocate a high fat diet. She just explains the role fat plays in keeping the body in good working order."
5,I loved this book,"Not only did I love this book, but it really has changed my life. I ended up going to a doctor because I was on anti-depressants and I didn't feel comfortable treating myself. I have been on amino acids and am changing the way I eat and I have not felt this great in years. I am very grateful for this book. I finally have an optimistic outlook on life. I am happy to get up in the mornings and I look forward to each day. I have not felt this way since before I had kids 10 years ago."
5,Most helpful book I've ever read!!!,"A year ago, I was suffering with suicidal depression, my adrenals were severely depleted, I was always exhausted and peri-menopausal I went to the Dr, who, surprise surprise, put me on an antidepressant, which gave such severe restless leg that I couldn't sleep . I had to find a better option. When I read this book, I finally understood what was wrong with me and, following the author's suggestions, I worked my way off the meds and started taking supplements. Within a few days I started feeling better and within a month I was completely healed. Eight months later, I still feel great. I've shared this book with several of my friends who have each found it extremely insightful and useful. Everyone should read this book."
3,Avoid the Kindle version,"I've only read about half this book, and haven't had a chance to implement the program for myself, so I cannot comment on its efficacy.There does appear to be a lot of good information in here, but it is buried amongst an annoying quantity of anecdotes and repetition.I recommend you avoid the Kindle version of The Mood Cure. The book contains a day-to-day recipe schedule in an graphic format that is difficult to read on the Kindle. It's annoying being unable to print out the recipes to take into the kitchen or shopping with you. There are also several pages of blank supplement schedules you are meant to photocopy and fill in, which are also nearly unreadable on the Kindle screen. Some measurements didn't make the jump to the Kindle, I see a number of question marks where there should be a fractional number."
3,The Mood Cure,"I'll make this review brief.I found some interesting, helpful information in the book. At the same time, I found that the author tended to attibute clinical success to the use of particular prescribed supplements, prescribed and sold by the author. The author did not take into account many variables that also could influence success. She oversimplified the influence of such systemic conditions as blood sugar dysregulation and thyroid problems. The author also selectively focused all her anecdotal references to glaring success stories in a way that seemed disingenuous and in a way that promoted products that she sells. Some of her discriptions of neurotransmitters were also atypical."
4,Just Great!,"Although I have most of the recordings on this CD, I bought it happily; to have three new songs from Fats.There was never a musician and singer like Fats Waller. The CD is a good collection of just Mr. Waller did back then."
3,A NICE CD,"MTB latest is a refreshing, breezy musical journey. its been a long 30+yrs for the band and as with all bands--suffered tragic losses etc. MTB has struck paydirt with 10 passionate songs that spin cowboys and the west. DOUG GRAY is still the keeper of the stable and his voice is tired but true. there are 3 songs from GEORGE MCCORKLE and one from TOY CALDWELL and both need no introduction. highlights are: A SAD COWBOY SONG and I LOVE YOU THAT WAY-thrown in a couple well to do rockers and you have a great lazy day lemonade song parade. with each listen I like it just a little more. its not the 70's but this is a good reflection of past experiences. good one boys."
4,Hilarious,We had a great time with the fart machine. It is great to brighten up any situation unfortunately it doesn't work however if the remote is more than 12 inches from the reciever.
4,Flatulence,This item is so much fun and much better than older models (which were hard to hear through the cushions of a couch).
4,IF YOU LOVE TO LAUGH!!!,"Then this one will do it. I bought one for myself and one for my mother-in-law. Just hide the fart machine under a chair, etc. and push the button on the remote and it sounds like the real thing. The only issue that we have had is that once in awhile it sounds by itself without pressing the button on the remote"
2,A Fart by Any other Name.,"I ordered the Fart Machine#2 because I love scatological humor and making my kids laugh. The Fart Machine#2 does make loud ""fart"" noises for sure. That is true. The accuracy of these ""farts"" sounding like real farts is not that great. There's like 15 different ""fart"" sounds, which play at random when you use the remote (which works VERY well) and about 2 of them sound convincing. The other 12 just sound like fake ""farts."" All in all, if you're really into fake farts, I'd recommend this product. If you're into a more ""real"" and unique fart sound, just eat some beans instead of blowing the fifteen bucks this costs."
4,Fun for all,This is fun for all. I am wearing the McCracken Plumber outfit for halloween and tried this on with this machine inside. I had so much fun with it because everyone was looking to see who did it.
2,Horrible range,"As long as you do not mind standing within 2 feet of the unit, the unit is fine and fun. I have replaced the batteries 3 times to no avail. With brand new batteries I can get it to work from about 4 feet but that is it. There is no discernible interference and the issue happens wherever I place the unit. It does not even work through an object like a door, no matter how close you are."
1,This one didn't work,"I have bought 3 or 4 of these and this one just didn't work. I like the machine it is fun, but this one was broken. I will order another one soon.."
3,good but stopped working after being out in car in cold weather,I left it in the seat in car and it did not work after a couple of cold nights. about 30 f
1,It simply doesn't work,"I put in a brand new battery and nothing. Wait, I take that back...it worked once. A nice, clean fart sound. Then...nothing. Totally ruined our practical joke."
5,Classic American Gag,Think 3 Stooges (sort of) when you consider buying this machine. I bought 2 this xmas and got rave review. Warning: some guests in your house will not think this is funny. Too bad...
5,Noise??,"Was thinking rating only 4 stars, This extremely funny device needs a parental override! Kids constantly play with the device. Still on the original batteries. Hopefully soon they will wear out.HAHA. All good fun!"
1,Doesn't work.,"I tried several 9 volt batteries and the unit never worked. The batteries got really hot, but nothing would happen. Very disappointed with this product."
2,It's defective,"I'm totally serious when I say this fart machine is defective. As soon as you turn it on, it starts farting away, you don't even have to touch the remote. It's actually very funny but if you want to play tricks on someone, it's no good."
1,The on-off button was loose,I was so excited when i received this product. I inserted new batteries and came to know that it wasn't working. I was disappointed. Then i tried to fiddle the on off button and I came to know there some loose connection with the button. I am struggling to make it work now.
1,used for less than a month and it no longer works,We purchased this item as a Christmas gift and within the first month it quit working! Because we ordered while Christmas shopping we did not actually open and use it until a month after purchase so by the time it quit working our window to return the item had expired! Terrible purchase.
5,Great Christmas morning diversion.,Worked well. It produced a multitude of diverse noises and fostered much conversation. There seem now to be many plans in the works for the future. Thanks!
5,Farting fun,"I brought it to work and we had a blast messing with people. Lots of strange comments and looks, hard to keep a straight face. Only thing I would change is being able to pick the farts for the right time."
1,Product review,"Can't stop the machine making the noise; the noise is unrealistic, the noise is too loud. Apart from that it's total waste of 10.00"
2,"Only works sporadically, Will need to get one that works.","I have had the original #1 for 12 years, still going strong. This new one only works after 3 or 4 presses of the button, stance.at a very short distance."
4,It's fart-tacular!,"Your wife won't think it's funny, but what the heck. Only complaint is that it has 15 different sounds and you can't chose which you are going to produce. Also, it seems to randomly ""misfire"" without the button being pushed when it is left on, which has the potential to lead to embarrassing situations. Suggestion: Hide it in the cart when grocery shopping with your wife. You'll both get a good laugh!"
3,"Fun, but won't fool many people...",This fart machine is a lot fun for the whole family. Hiding it in random places and then waiting for someone to come around and startling them with flatulence noises is entertaining.PROS:- Remote-click farting allows for surprises- Distance/range on remote-click is good- Batteries last a whileCONS:- Fart noises don't sound very realistic- Even on lowest volume it can be too loud
4,"This review for those lite at ""Fart""","I got this for my husband for Christmas after he made a verbal wish for a Farting Machine to hide in the breakroom at his work. We have yet to see how that is going to go as it has not left our house because even though we know it is not real, we are having too much with it at our house.I did not give it 5 stars because, although terribly funny, not all of the ""farts"" sound real. And it would be awesome if you could choose the fart, rather than go through the entire sequence of farts. Our favorite fart is number 8. Sounding like one of those that slip out and you try to disguise with a cough. Bottom line if you think toots are funny, you will enjoy this product. lol...lol...lol"
5,A Hit,The Fart Machine is a total hit with the young and old. I gave them as Christmas gifts and everybody loved them and had a blast. They even ended up at adult Christmas parties and were the life of the party.
4,Fart Machine II,"Yes, it's immature, childish, and over the top and make even the worst day at the office hysterical. We planted it in one of the executives offices under the plant leaves while he was at lunch. Upon returning he called several employees into his office and the secretary outside his office hit the remote when someone moved in their chair. Many tears of joy were shed that day and it has gone down hill from there.It's also great for the house, the elevator, in a bag while shopping... Just enjoy!"
1,#2 is right,"They advertised works from 100 ft away. I think they forgot a decimal, should of read ""Works from less then 1.0 ft away. Even after replacing the batteries in the remote and the #2 box."
3,Lasting Time,I was disappointed that my first fart machine didn't work very long. I changed batteries. You could hear them faintly but the sound mechanism must have broken.
2,LOOKED USED,"UPDATE JULY 7Seller is giving full refund with shipping, due to mydisapointment and request in my email.Product arrived wrapped in old used pattern tissue papers , imagine that.The remote looked worn.A hand written note was attached on how to use it.I hope it works, I like those silly gadgets and shouldhave purchased it fromThings You Never New Existed.comd"
4,Best I've used,"While it was a little frustrating to put together as the plastic parts need to snap together and you need a screw driver to wedge the plastic base for the top to fit properly. Make sure you wait 30 minutes after filling, for the wick to absorb the water, as the fan won't work. Also be sure the over hang on the back of the wick filter is hung on the over hang at the back of the base unit. But we started with 34% humidity and in less than 24 hrs it came up to 50%. We used level 3 on the fan, as the higher levels are noisy, but at this level and result for what this product is supposed to do, it was great. Easy to fill, no taking out bottles, just pour into the reservoir. The humidistat on the unit registers too high. I put tape over it and use my small humidistat to measure the humidity. They could have left this part off. Anyway if you want the humidity to raise quickly, this is your item. A lot better than the old filter belt circular kinds."
1,Humidistat was broken,"I paid 113 USD for this unit. It was awkward to use, and felt cheaply made. It did a fine job humidifying the house but the humidistat was broken. Its humidity reading would not drop below 50%, when other humidistats in my home were indicating 30%. According to it, the humidity level was about 60% ! I have found a review elsewhere indicating the same problem. I returned it and bought a unit for 70 USD that works much better."
1,Jeff is right - Don't buy this humidifier!,"Does not work as advertised. When set at our preferred 40% humidity, the humidistat room reading reads 45% and never varies.When the preferred humidity level was set to 50% the fan will run until the humidity level reaches 55% and then shut off. But, after just A FEW SECONDS, the room humidity level reading drops to 47-49% and the fan comes on. Again, it will run for just a few seconds and repeat the above process continually, never staying on or off for more than a few seconds at a time. There is no way humidity can rise or fall that much in just a few seconds.After calling the factory, they said it was defective and to bring it back to the store. A second unitwas ordered which ended up being no better than the first.I ended up returning the second unit as well. Stay away from this particular humidifer. It's noisey and cheaply made."
2,these are not very good,"these speakers shown in the picture are not the ones you recieve in the mail. these speakers dont have any low frequency response, they dont even let the singers voice be heard. these are basically tweeters. but if you listen to clasical music these would be good otherwise dont buy."
3,It Will Get You There But Not Always Logically.,The Navman 550 is an OK unit. The interface is pretty easy to use and its nice that it comes preloaded with US and Canada maps to save you the hassle of doing that on your own.Positives:-Pre-loaded with Maps-Gets You There-Affordable-can run on a batteryNegatives:-Does not work in cities (will not grab a signal in NYC or Toronto)-Has trouble getting a GPS fix sometimesFreezes-Does not have any exit numbers for highways-80% of the time does not tell you the next street you need to turn on to -will just say turn right in this many miles-volume is way too low to the point where its barely worth it talking because you cant hear itOverall the Navman 550 is an OK unit at best. If you can get a good deal on it (under $200) I say go for it but if not theres better GPS units on the market.
1,purcahser,"I find that the Navman 550 is a discontinued GPSTalked to Navan. I sent letter asking to return product, asit wan not stated, that it was a discontinued model.The maps do not have updated maps, there fore it does not showthe 911 road names for finding rural addreses therefore it is notthe help that other GPS units are. Would appreciate being able toreturn the unit."
1,Useless Over Time,"It is very unfortunate that you cannot get map updates for this GPS. Overall I found it to be well built, easy to use and efficient. However, I have had the unit for over 2 years. The maps are in serious need of up-dating and there appears no way to do that. There are many places in the country that are constantly changing (Palm Springs, Las Vegas, etc.) On my last visit to Las Vegas this device was practically useless as the map software is so out of date. This is a dead horse. Definitely do not buy."
1,Don't Pay Cash For Trash!,"There isn't a single word in this book that's worth the time it takes to read it. The reader below who claims that ""five stars isn't enough"" is either related to Donald Clarke or else he's an employee of the publishing company. No book that was ever written about Frank Sinatra (including Kitty Kelley's) is more deserving of going out of print. Let's all hope that it happens sooner rather than later. It's Mr. Clarke himself who apparently doesn't know the meaning of the word ""biography"". I suggest he try reading anything written by Peter Guralnick to see how it's done."
1,A third-rate book written by a second-rate writer,"You get the feeling reading this book that Donald Clarke sees himself as a far more noble and heroic character than some mere mortal like Frank Sinatra. Clarke has taken self-righteousness and developed it into something approaching an art form. A waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of paper, glue, ink, and whatever else was needed to print this ""biography"". By the way, give the word ""biography"" the loosest interpretation possible. Donald Clarke has even less of a clue as to what the word ""biograpy"" means and his book is the best evidence to support my thesis."
1,"Pure unadulterated rubbish, a waste of both time and money..","The author of this book doesn't even attempt to disguise his seething contempt and dislike for Sinatra. Unsubstantiated rumours, innuendo, ""re-created"" dialogue, speculation ad nauseum. Dreadful rubbish, just dreadful... Do yourself a favour, and read anything written by Will Friedwald (run a search on his name for available books). In the end, the only thing that matters is the music, not the person or the image, just the music."
5,Good Reminder,I have really enjoyed wearing this as it is a wonderful reminder to slow down and enjoy the moment! I am very pleased with this fun watch.
3,Satisfied,Both of these items were for a surprise 70th birthday party and were quite a hit. I almost wish I hadordered two watches vs. the one that I did.
2,Ehh...,"I was underwhelmed by this soup. I purchased it based on reviews I had read in the book ""21-Day Weight Loss,"" with hopes that it would be a tasty and quick vegan lunch on days when my time is limited. I found it to be very salty and not tasty whatsoever. I forced myself to eat about half of one of the cups and threw the rest away. Now I'm left with five more cups that I will most likely be donating somewhere. It's possible that Pad Thai is the only gross one of Dr. McDougal's soups, but I don't think I will be taking my chances with any of the other flavors offered."
4,Very good,"This is a nice quick and easy soup. There is a lot of good thai flavor (i.e. you get a yummy cilantro taste). Some people might not like the 580mg sodium in the whole cup, but I don't expect miracles with convenience food. It is quite filling and the noodles, even though they are rice noodles, do not get clumpy or sticky like this type tends to do. Very easy to pop in my purse and take to work. I make it just like the package directions say, add a touch more water after it is done soaking a few minutes and it comes out perfect.I took a star away because I feel that there is only one decent lunch sized serving instead of two that the package claims. I don't like when manufacturers do that. The way this soup is packaged, it seems obvious to me that you will make it and eat it in one sitting."
2,"Flavorless, salty and not really Pad Thai","I'm not sure what part of this is supposed to be pad thai - the noodles are short and chewy and the flavor pack tastes mainly of salt. I know this is an instant product but I was expecting something that was vaguely close to Pad Thai rather than a bowl of hot water without much flavor. Although this is tagged as vegan, I suspect it's not very healthy since I felt like drinking a gallon of water after eating this."
2,Not quite as bad as the ramen noodles,"Second strike for Dr. McDougall's. Love the pilaf and tortilla soup, hate the ramen and pad thai. So mushy, salty and disgusting with a weird chemical taste. I'm so glad that my Publix carries the nearly complete line of Dr. McDougall's products. I would kick my own butt for buying this product in bulk."
1,Toilet taste,"I've never gave a bad review, but this one deserves one!!!I can be stuck on an island and i rather starve to death then eat this piece of toilet taste food!!So nasty, I fed it to my dog... they barked at me for 30 minutes straight. lolDo not buy it!!!"
3,There are better McDougall varieties,"I have to agree with the other naysayers on this one. It has an odd flavor to it and I suspect it's because of the fruit powders - I think the tamarind powder gives it the weird flavor/aftertaste. I think I would like this a lot more if that were absent.I don't know much about Thai cooking but others are saying it doesn't taste like Pad Thai anyway, so removal of what may be a Thai ingredient (tamarind) isn't going to make sales go down.There's still the standard good stuff that stands for most McDougall varieties. You get a lot of it, it's convenient and great to have around at the office for a more healthy-than-the-vending machine snack. I suspect it would be more satisfying too, nice and hot soup mmm!So, I won't be buying it again. May I recommend the Spring Onion Noodle Soup? That is a very tasty one to buy in lieu of this variety."
1,Extremely bland and not remotely the flavor of Pad Thai,"I liked Dr. McDougall's split pea soup and his oatmeal, so I decided to try this.Oh man. I could not believe how disappointing this was. The ony PRO was that it was chock full of noodles. If you love rice noodles, the Asian style, this has oodles.But the flavor was lacking. So bland, it was like someone took the soup and watered it down and served noodles in saltyish water. It's called Pad Thai soup, but as a pad thai afficionado, I can't say I noticed any resemblance to pad thai--other than Asian noodles.If you like watery noodle soup, go for it.If you actually want a burst of Thai yumminess, this is not a soup I can recommend.Mir"
4,quite good,"these are very tasty and so quick and easy to prepare. my only gripe with these is that the paper cup has the tendency to leak out of the bottom. if they used a foam cup like the ramen noodle cups, there wouldn't be this problem, and it would be easier to handle too, since the paper cup gets quite hot whereas the styrofoam does not. regardless of these annoyances, i still higly recommend this product. one could easily put this in their own bowl to avoid the leaking and heat issues."
2,"Edible, but certainly not good","""Fresh flavor"" -- don't you believe it. This stuff is more like ""barely tastes like food.""I was looking for a gluten free version of the cup o' noodles products that are so tasty (and so not good for you!). This wasn't it. I won't say that I had to choke it down, but it wasn't very far from that. Out of an abundance of optimism, I'll probably try one more flavor of Dr. McDougall's cups -- this was the first I'd tried -- but I'm guessing that after that I'll be done with this brand for good."
3,I am not crazy about it,"I really love pretty much all of the Dr. McDougall soups that I have tried... but this one was a disappointment. First off, they should NOT call it Pad Thai. It is a thai-ish rice noodle soup but it is nothing like Pad Thai or even a ""Pad Thai soup."" Seriously, I have no idea why they call it that. The noodles were good but the soup had a somewhat gritty texture. It was not that flavor-full. I would recommend you try the hot and sour soup instead - much better! I will eat the rest of the package, but I definitely will not order this again."
5,It's own thing,"A tasty and satisfying attempt at Asian cuisine. Doesn't really taste anything like real Pad Thai, but is good nonetheless. A bit high in sodium for me, but if you generally like Asian noodle dishes (Pad Thai, Lo Mein, Chow Fun, etc.) you'll like this."
1,Not so great..,"I have had Pad Thai before...And always liked it quite a bit. This kind, to me, is pretty disgusting. It's nothing like any of it I've had before. The noodles are weird and really short and the broth they're in is gross. Although I really love some of the other Dr McDougall's products, I would not recommend this one :("
3,Meh ...,I bought these to keep at my desk at work for a quick vegan lunch. They are OK - they taste fine (especially if you add salt and hot sauce). It is definitely nice to have them around in a pinch. And they are a decent value- but nothing to write home about.
5,Delicious,"I've tried most of the McDougall dry soups and noodles, and this is quite possibly my favorite. It may not be what you'd expect from a Pad Thai, but it has great flavor and is perfect when you need something quick."
2,a little beyond blah,"don't follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you'll get. i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this ""soup"" tolerable. i didn't fill it to the line, i filled it half way, and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles. not too bad, but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price...not even close."
1,"Gross flavor, doesn't taste like Pad Thai","I have tried and enjoyed many Dr. McDougall instant soups, but this one is going to the trash can. I literally spit it back out. I love Pad Thai from Thai restaurants, but this was nowhere close to a real Pad Thai flavor. Skip this one."
1,Not what you'd expect,"I love Pad Thai and had great expectations for this product. Unfortunately, it was a bust. However, the product is described as a soup, and that should have been a tip off, since Pad Thai is more of a spicy noodle dish than a soup. You won't find either the flavor or texture that you'll find in real Pad Thai."
1,Neither Pad Thai nor Soup,"I cannot recommend Dr. McDougall's Pad Thai Noodle Soup. If it doesn't look like pad thai or taste like pad thai, it's probably a good idea to call it something besides pad thai. A few broken rice noodles in the bottom of a cup of dehydrated broth does not a pad thai make.I had this for lunch today, and the other kids pointed and laughed at me. Thai people walked past my table, frowning and shaking their heads. Soup technicians from the Department of Soup issued my lunch a cease-and-desist order. President Obama stopped by my table, gave me a stern look, and said, ""Mark, I thought we had made more progress than this. Forget the debt ceiling. We need to do something about this concoction, which is neither pad thai, nor soup, but an unsatisfying amalgamation of the two."""
3,don't expect restaurant Pad Thai,"Length:: 0:37 Minstastes okay, although seasoning tastes similar to most of McDougalls seasoning IMO. I'm thinking a little peanut sauce added would make this delicious, and resemble a taste more similar to Pad Thai."
2,Noodles Are All Little Pieces,"Like the other reviews, it doesn't taste like Pad Thai. I was disappointed that the 'noodles' are actually broken up pieces of noodles...so no long strands here. I think it's how it is supposed to be. : ( It is more of a soup and okay tasting if you weren't expecting pad thai, but I won't buy it again."
2,I did not enjoy this soup.,"I like McDougall's products. A lot. My favorites include: Black Bean and Lime Soup and the variety of oatmeals. The Pad Thai soup is not good. Both, the flavor and texture are disappointing. Even if you leave your knowledge of real Pad Thai behind, this soup just doesn't cut it... especially for the price. (The same goes for their ramens... yuck!)"
4,Soups hit the spot especially when you are in a hurry...,"These soups are so convenient to cook especially when you are in a hurry. The flavor packet is delicious, the noodles warm up to a nice soft texture; not soggy at all."
4,It's good for what it is,"Not sure how some people here are expecting gourmet out of a soup in a cup. It's made out of rice noodles and meant to be fairly healthy. It is quick and decent tasting snack or meal for the workplace. If you have a coffee Bunn machine in the office, you can just get some water from the spigot and let it sit for 5 mins.It's not spicy but something in it definitely makes me sweat a bit every time I eat it.Ignore the negative reviews. Some people obviously don't get that this is meant to be healthy and MSG free. People will complain about everything. If you want a gourmet soup, don't buy soup in a cup. That's ridiculous."
3,Pad Thai Flavor Alright,"I cooked this soup according to the package directions and the Pad Thai noodles were still very undercooked. I added 3 minutes to the cooking time, and the noodles were better. The taste of the soup is alright, but nothing too great. It has some sort of unidentifiable cubes on top (maybe tofu?), about half a cup of noodles, some carrots, and a few pieces of corn. Overall, I wish there were a few more ingredients or maybe a little more noodles. I also would have preferred it to be slightly spicier. So far, I prefer the tortilla flavor of Dr. McDougall's."
2,"A lot of promise, no delivery","I decided to try the Pad Thai since I'd tasted some of the other flavors. It wasn't good. The noodles were fine, but the broth was gritty and definitely not up to snuff. The fresh flavor advertised is not so fresh and definitely not flavorful. I'd give this one a pass until they change the recipe."
2,I Agree-too fast,"This could be a good recording but it's rather unsensitive and Majella Cullagh's voice is tiresome. For a very good studiorecording (with all music, without cuts) buy maestro Zeddas from the 70's with Rosetta Pizzo, Pietro Bottazzo, Nucci Condò etc. It's slower but at the same time much more true to the work than Parrys boring (but fast), stale tempos. For example the big ""prayer"" in the 2nd act ""Deh tu reggi"" almost drives me to tears in Zeddas version (which surely must be the meaning) but in Parrys hands I almost feel nothing. And the ensembles are way too fast. If you want a good liverecording, the one from Pesaro with Ricciarelli and Furlanetto is the only available that hasn't got extensive cuts (sony). Mateuzzi is the tenor in that one and he isn't my favourite but the rest is sooo good."
3,no so pefect fit,i purchased this for my 91 MR2 turbo. it really dosent fit like OEM. it is performing fine but was a very tight fit into the down pipe.
4,Excellent resource,This book was very informative and an excellent resource. You learn a lot about yourself.
1,Author's clearly never been depressed,"Any book that talks about a ""Three-Step Program for Overcoming Depression"" isn't worth reading. I wish Henry were right. I wish it were that easy. The truth is, depression destroys a person's ability to ""detach, see feelings as passing clouds,"" or even meditate. As one author put it: ""You don't learn to meditate AFTER you find out you have a brain tumor."" You work on these skills before you need them.The best book I can recommend for dealing with depression is actually an old book, written by a woman who clearly understood the bewilderment and despair of depression and the ravaging terror of anxiety. The book is ""Hope and Help for Your Nerves,"" by Claire Weekes. Although originally written for people suffering from anxiety, every client I've lent it to has replaced my copy or refused to give it back. Once you feel better, read The Chemistry of Joy. But while you're suffering, read Claire Weekes."
2,Needs improvement,"Sound is good, but the earpieces themselves are large and bulky. Not great for running. Also, the clip is made of a clear thin plastic spindle with a soft plastic curve attached at the end. The soft plastic immediately broke off from the spindle. All I did was store them in a separate compartment of my gym bag and they broke. The clip will still rest on my ear but not comfortably and they won't stay on unless I wrap a bandana around my ears. Also, even before they broke, these earphones did not stay on during sit ups or push ups so they are not great for the gym. If you are a walker who treats them very carefully, they will work fine for you."
2,Not for use on the go.,"These headphones are not very comfortable, they are large and heavy for supporting them with only your ears with insufficient cushioning. For sound quality they are okay, but if you turn your head too fast they fly off. I cannot imagine using them while trying to run or walk. I was baffled by the hinge on them to make the earpiece wider, they are not secure in their ""locked"" state so I see no need to make more room on them. The main feature of attraction was the retractable cord, but the wire between the ear pieces themselves is not retractable, far longer than it appears in the image, and it sort of nullifies the appeal of that feature. I gave this product a year of ""benefit of the doubt"" and then went back to a standard ear bud. I have been much happier."
3,4-way Percussion Massager with heat,I only used the massager for a short time but it seemed to be adequate for the sore shoulder I had at the time. I was also using topical medications so I'm not sure how effective the massager was.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!,"Amazon you better make sure this phone takes AAA batteries. You told me the same thing! It does not! Batteries are hard to find, do not last, and are very expensive! Lcd screen went out in spots. Ringer sticks and goes on for 30 to 40 seconds. I should have unpacked it looked at the batteries and sent it back right away! My mistake! This set of phones is landfill! THE WORST! DO NOT BUY THIS PAIR OF PHONES!!!"
2,Somewhat basic,"I must admit that I had expected more from this DVD. It's not a bad DVD - everything is quite professionally and neatly done - but the material presented is probably not very useful if you are an amateur photographer, i.e. not a total novice.If you are about to buy your first digital camera, or if you've just bought yourself one, this DVD will definitely fill in some blanks, but if you're expecting very in-depth technical information about digital cameras and digital photography - the stuff you won't find in the manual - then you will likely be a tad disappointed. This is not the learning tool that will take you a significant step closer to being a hard-core professional photographer."
2,Frustrating for this vocalist,"I'm not the most gadget inclined person, and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use. But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two. In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the ""3:00"" position on the dial. And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation. It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time! Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless. I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead. Even if it costs more. Why spend money on something that doesn't work?"
2,Wasn't too impressed,"First off, this thing is small. I didn't realize how small it was until I received the item.I own the M-Audio Fast Track USB Pro, and thought that the Fast Track USB would be of comparable quality. Not so. I guess that's why it costs half as much. But you get what you pay for.I returned the item and bought another Fast Track USB Pro. The Pro model has exceptional audio quality. I felt for the extra money, it was a better purchase in the long run. I was not impressed by the sound quality of this model. Amazon was great and allowed me to return this product for a full refund."
1,Not so easy,I have a few issues/problems:-m-audio on line registration does not seem to work.-i tried to call for tech support - was on the phone for more then 60 minutes - no answer.-was not able to successfully install fast truck on windows xp-m-audio nova mic does not work with fast truck
2,Get something else,No 64-bit drivers yet i believe. And didn't work too well when i got everything working for a 32-bit system either.
2,do not like it at alll,I ended up buying a better M-Audio product.. if you need a USB audio interface product try buying something else..
2,Time consuming,"It's probably a great product... once it works! Damn, I just can't get it to work!!! Finally I configured the settings, so I can hear something when I record w/my mic but the input is too low! I spent the whole day setting it up on my Vista. It did work just fine on my XP, though... until it was reinstalled and...bang, doesn't work, guys spent the whole evening just trying to set it up for a karaoke... I mean, you don't get any help in the manual, I just googled googled googled... too tired... My laptop mic and a webcam have better input than my Shure SM58 with the Fast Track. Seriously, I wish somebody explained it to me, how the hell to set this thing up.[Edit: OK, so I think I found out that it needs additional power to work with dynamic mics like sm58 - you have to buy a preamp like ""Tube preamp"" because those usb ports aren't enough.]"
2,Didn't work out for me,"I know several DJs and music pros who use the higher end M-audio products so I thought this would be a good choice for my needs. I was using it with a Beringer mic for voice over/podcasting. But the input from the mic was so low that I always had too much noise. I couldn't remove the noise and keep a quality recording. I spent a couple of weeks trying to troubleshoot the problem, and the lack of useful manuals in the box or on the M-audio website only added to my frustration. Maybe I received a defective unit, or maybe it wasn't compatible with my mic but I ended returning it."
5,M-Audio Fast track,great for portabilitydont buy if you need to record more than one mic or instrument at a time
4,Problems fixed,"I think a lot of the problems reported in these reviews have been fixed. I am running a PC with Vista and installation of Session software was simple and fairly quick (less than 15 minutes). No compatibility issues. I'm getting a pretty decent sound plugging my guitar directly into the fast track. I've previously used Cakewalk and for simple recording and mixing, the Session software is comparable. It's a good product for the money for someone who just wants to play around and experiment, and makes good (not great) recordings. I don't think you can expect professional quality recording for $100."
3,Not bad for the price.,"I am using this with a Pentium 1.7 GHz PC with Windows XP and SP-2. It installed easy enough, grabbed the latest drivers off the M-Audio website. Have to agree with others in that the documentation is not the greatest. Once I figured out to use an RCA to phono converter and plug it into the sound card then select the Fast Track as default playback and Sound recording device I was in business. Added bonus is that I can play along with the songs I want to record from I-Tunes and make sure I have the parts right. Get a decent set of headphones and plug them into the unit, makes a big difference with the sound quality. I really like the Session software; the last time I did any recording I had a Teac 4 track reel to reel and an 8 channel mixer, so this is definitely a step up for me. May not sound completely professional, but what do you want for the price."
2,Save Your Money,"I've been writing songs for years and i finally decided to go ahead and drop several hundred dollars on a condenser mic, stand, cables, and finally the Fast Track USB interface. I opened the box filled with excitement only to be disappointed when i realized that this interface DOES NOT provide phantom power supply. Huge let down. Not only that but the entire device felt cheaply made of flimsy plastic that is painted to look somewhat metallic. I've heard a lot of people running Vista 64 have had problems with the drivers as well. I'm returning this and buying the ART duel pre two-channel pre amp which for only 20$ more provides phantom power, has TWO XLR imputs, has full Vista support, and is made of sturdy metal. Don't waste your time like i did on this piece of junk."
4,It's good,"Overall I'm please with this device. I recently just purchased an XLR to 1/4"" adaptor and I've been pluging my guitar into the XLR port on the Fast Track and this has made a major improvement in the recording levels. I recommend this unit as a cheap effective way to record your guitar on a Mac."
3,not what I expected,"it isn't the best, The start-up software does not work for all platforms im running windows vista 32 the software does not run with vista. So, if You have vista forget it, does run for xp though."
4,Great Product,"After having used this product extensively for strictly voice recording, I can say that it is very good for the price. I haven't really used the Session Software too much, but the device worked just fine with Pro Tools M-Audio Edition, as well as Audacity. Instrumental recording worked out quite well as well. The only thing annoying about the product is its lack of instructions for those who may not already know what he or she is doing, however these can easily be found online."
1,Terrible interface,I spent over an hour attempting to record my guitar on here and never ended up getting it. If you plan on getting recording equipment don't settle for this crap.
2,Shoddy,"Worked great for about a week. After one song was recorded, the mic input was the only thing still working. Another week passed and I had to re-record vocals 4-5 times to get 1-2 minutes of recording that wasn't filled with static. He headphone jack would cut in and out frequently, and it caused sound card problems in my computer. I suppose you get what you pay for, and I have learned my lesson.Side note: The program that comes with this is terrible as well. Audacity is far superior, and free."
3,Works well with a direct box,"At first, I couldn't get the instrument input to work too well - a lot of noise and I had to crank the input way up to get a mediocre level. What solved this was to go in using a direct box - that allows you to use the XLR out and have more control over your signal. The Rolls Matchbox sells for $25-30 and does a wonderful job.This is a solid, cheap audio interface for anyone recording alone. It's not going to work too well if the whole bands's there, though. But, you're probably doing it all yourself if the computer's involved, anyway.Tip: Mute the track you are recording on your PC. . .this solves all latency problems."
2,Software is for Windows only . . .,"First, let me say that Fasttrack works perfectly for my needs -- i needed to get a mic signal through an XLR cable into my mac powerbook for demos, absent of my usual protools software and clunky hardware. the mac sees the fasttrack immediately. BUT you should also know that none of the bundled software works with the laptop.and considering this is an input box AND software you and i are paying for -- if you're on a mac you should go elsewhere to buy the box alone instead of this package. i saw 2 new units at the amazon ""new and used"" link at the top of this page (sans sessions software) for a much lower price.Not exactly fair dealing from M-Audio as they flat-out name Garage Band in their product description and then talk about how great the accompanying software is--for that reason alone this package only gets 2 stars from this mac/protools user."
2,Weak machine,"First time I cranked it up a little bit it blew out. I really don't have that powerful of a system. It's just pooped out on me after only using it a week. I guess for the price I paid I couldn't expect much, but I was pretty pissed when it went out why a paying customer was recording."
1,Bad deal all the way around,I purchased the M-Audio FAST TRACK from Amazon because it had SESSON software. I received the unit without SESSON and I sent it back. Amazon sent out a second unit (no SESSON software) and a company called Austin Bazaar sent out a unit (no SESSON software) I kept the Amazon unit and I sent back the Unit to Austin Bazaar (unopened) and todate I never have received my $99.00 back from Austin Bazaar. I went to Best Buy and purchased the SESSON USB for $49.00 (with SESSON)& M-Audio Support sent a burned copy of SESSON. Bottom Line after spending $240.00 SESSON didn't work on any of my three computers. I bought Calkwalk Music Composer 4 from Calkwalk for $39.99 & it works fine. A total $280.00 learning curve.
2,Barely works - especially if you use Vista,"You can download a driver to run this interface with Vista, but it doesn't quite work the way it should anyway. You can barely hear guitar, and both guitar and voice record in mono. The voice is pretty good anyway, and gives you a cleaner sound than using a mic through the USB or the mic jack. So, it does have some use. Overall, though, I should have spent more and gotten a unit with more gain. Even the microphone only gets louder if you turn the volume practically all the way up."
2,Can't get it to work with windows 7 64,"Works fine with my Apple laptop, that's a plus. Windows 7 64, not so much. I wouldn't mind so much if I wanted to use this device with my apple, but I don't. I bought this to use on my desktop which is windows 7 64 bit. I waited patiently for windows 7 64 drivers, all the while this device is sitting uselessly on my shelf. Finally 64 bit windows drivers are offered. I've tried many times downloading and installing the drivers. Rinse an repeat. I still can not get this toy to respond to windows 7 64. I've read many forums, I read all of the info on M-Audio's site, but to no avail. So, as of today I would not recommend this product if you are running Windows 7 64 (a total zero to me). I did however give the product a couple stars for working ""out of the box"" with Apple. Your mileage may vary of course."
4,"Works fine, but...","I bought the Fast Track to practice guitar in Garage Band. I use a Mac Pro Intel running OS 10.5.SET UP - no issues. Plug and play. In system preferences you need to change input and output to Fast Track USB.USABILITY - I had to plug my external speakers into Fast Track - this partially disables the system volume control - minor hassle. The design is flawed - inputs for guitar and microphone are on the back of the unit near the USB port. If I'm facing the thing, it makes more sense to have them on the front of the unit, so I can plug in without flipping it around. And since it is so small and light, it can flip over w/ the weight of the cables. I have mine sitting sideways - pretty dumb!SOUND - is fine for practice. You want to follow Garage Band instructions closely to avoid aggravation.CONCLUSION - not great, but fine for the price and my purposes."
1,Disappointed,I bought this product thinking it's for beginners and hence easy to use. It does not work with my macbook. I dont know who to contact either about this problem! This is extremely disappointing.
1,terrible dissapointment,"I don't have alot of money. I was wanting to do some multi track home recording so i bought this on amazon and set it up on my pc which runs windows xp. I paid a proffesional recording egineer to help me with the set up. once we got everything set up I recorded a track and played it back only to find strange sound blasts and skipping on the track. we tried recording multiple takes and every time there were the strange sounds and skipping of the track. It seemed like protools had intentionally made a faulty product so i would buy their more expensive version.Anyone have any wisdom concerning this?thanks, daniel,"
1,Very bad......,"I found a lot of other reviews, even in this site, about this product. I dont know if I personally have this problems, or other users just dont realize...I will tell u some things that happens to me with this product:1- When I first bought it there were no drivers for my version of Snow Leopard (the newest one), so I had to wait like 2 months to ""use"" it.2- The output sound of the card has a terrible HUMMM, that I cant get to fix.3- Input gain levels are silly LOW.. I can barely record an active bass guitar... but if I plug a passive bass or an electric guitar the signal is useless...4- Dont even try to write to M-Audio... They dont even answer Tech Support messages.. don't waste your time. Face it.. u just lost your $100.Hope you read this and avoid this product... there are a lot of other brands."
1,does not have phantom!,I thought this would have phantom like my brothers. I was wrong. does not come with enough inputs. screw this thing. I am sending it back!
1,have the right operating system,"I CANNOT SAY THIS IS A BAD PRODUCT BECAUSE I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT.I WANTED TO RECORD MUSIC FROM MY WIFE'S CLAVINOVA. I HOOKED IT UP AND IT WOULD NOT LOAD AT ALL. I TRIED FOR TWO DAYS. EVENTUALLY I WENT TO THEIR WEBSITE AND, AFTER AN HOUR OF SEARCHING, I FOUND OUT THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP MEDIA EDITION. WELL, GUESS WHAT I HAVE!! I BOUGHT IT IN USED CONDITION AND COULD NOT RETURN IT, SO, EBAY, HERE WE COME AGAIN!"
1,awful experience,"I bought the item, I never received it. I was told that I will receive a reimburse, plus a courtesy product if I erased the comment. I never received the product."
4,Pleasant Read,"This was the first historical romance from Patricia Potter that I have read (I have read several of her romantic suspense books) and I was pleasantly surprised with it. I have found that although many of the romantic suspense authors started in historical romance, their story-telling there is not as full. This is not the case with Patricia Potter. Beloved Stranger was a good book that I would recommend to anyone looking for a pleasant read on a quiet day."
2,Not as pleasant as you would anticipate.,"This is a little more country than you might expect. After the first few songs you kind of get bored with it. It is only the same song over and over again. On the other hand, if you like pure country, this is definitely the CD for you."
5,Love God rocks!,"God rocks if the perfect way to memorize scripture! Even my husband and I catch ourselves singing the songs, they are so catchy."
5,Excellente,Love it! all the songs that I love from adolescentes. The best recomiendo a todos los fanaticos que lo compren buen sonido y buena calidad de video.
5,Great quality,I had purchased most other accessories to this bathroom set and was shorting one rug. The color scheme is very neutral and very elegant.I found that Croscill has exceptional quality for a moderate price.
3,"Nice rug, but....","Very nice, thick quality rug, BUT, I did not realize it would not have rubber backing on it; I did not see it listed in the posting. It is very slippery. You will need to buy some backing for it. The posting also states that it is made in the USA, but it clearly states that it is made in China right on the tag on the rug. A previous review stated that it is not machine washable. It states that it is machine washable on the tag, though I haven't tried it yet, as I've only had it a few days. I would think that maybe it will work in a front-loader, and maybe not in a top loader? Will repost when I try it!"
4,Very nice rug,"I bought this rug to match the rest of the Croscill Spa Leaf accessories set. The only thing I am not crazy about is the fact that it is not washable, it must be spot cleaned. Being white on the edges, that makes it somewhat of a problem. But it is nice and thick and matches everything beautifully."
2,Hard to clean,"This looks nice out of the packaging - but you can't wash it in the washing machine, making it very hard to keep clean. I would not buy this product again because I can't wash it, although I do get complements on it all the time."
3,The Waiting Game - Harlequin,For some reason I just enjoy the Harlequin novels turned to movies. They are definitely not Oscar winning material but personally I enjoy them just the same. This one is not amongst my favorites but it is alright and for the price I say it was worth it to me.
5,Perfect!,"""Karaoke Queen"" is one of the best, and one of the most fun, songs that Catatonia has ever done. It's bouncy and light, the kind of song you sing loudly into your hairbrush. The b-sides are great too. ""Don't Wanna Talk About It"" reminds me of the way I used to feel about my parents ""...they say I've done it wrong again, they say I've left myself with nothing much to give, and they try and show me how to live, I must be good, repent, and forgive..."" The remix of ""All Girls Are Fly"" is likewise fantastic."
5,I don't know how she keeps doing it ...THIS ALBUM ROCKS!,Once again Tori has managed to release an album I am completly facinated with and just can't listen to enough. Tori Amos is a creative fountian of sheer wonderfulness.
4,poor Beekeeper,"Poor Beekeeper, everyone didn't like you! you have some mediocre/ lousy tracks, but there are some that are really, really nice. Martha's Foolish Ginger is my favourite. I was also sad that the song Garlands was banished to b-side land because it should have been on the album."
2,So not Tori to me,"tori has always had the ability to amaze fans with each of her albums until the beekeeper. I have listened to this album over and over and I just cant get into it at all. As sad as it is to admit, I don't like anything about this album. Sure there are a few songs that are okay(original sinsuality, barons of suburbia and the title track). This is not her strongest album by any means though. If you are a new Tori fan I would suggest you start with anything before this (*Ahem*-little earthquakes). I love Tori and I always will but this wasn't the Tori I've grown with."
4,"""I have come for the beekeeper""","Well, first of all I must say I got to know Tori by a friend who showed me ""Scarlet's Walk"" last summer, since that moment I felt in love with her voice and her melodies, after that I started buying all her albums, not in any special order but the last one I bought was ""Little Earthquakes"" and I can say the evolution she shows from ""Little Earthquakes"" to ""The Beekeeper"" is awsomely gorgeous... 19 tracks, divided in gardens, with a soul depth that makes you want to listent again and again this is one of the best Tori's productions, and the theme of the whole album really fits in, you can feel butterflies and all those insects in your stomach while listening songs like ""Parasol"", ""Mother Revolution"", ""Jamaica Inn"" and even the best one ""The Beekeeper"", the song that names the album, if not the best, the most powerful song she has ever written/performed. This may not be the best Amos work but it is woth to take home."
3,Great Concept. Some bad songs.,"The concept of this album is great. With the gospel and the garden. And the pictures are fantastic. Also, some of the songs are wonderful, but not classic Tori. Only classic Tori if you've only heard Scarlet's Walk. She's in a new place, i get it. I appreciate it. But the new place doens't give her as much umph. She is still an extremely talented woman. And all in all this is a great album."
5,"Very long, and every song is good","One of the things I love about Tori Amos is that in addition to being an incredibly talented artist, she doesn't usually skimp on her albums. This one in particular is very nearly 80 minutes long, and unlike some of her others, I can listen to it all the way through. A few of my favorites: ""Ribbons Undone"" is a loving ode to her young daughter, ""Ireland"" is a silly but fun song - silly because you can't really drive to Ireland, and I am not sure what ""Martha's Foolish Ginger"" is about but it's a good song. Another favorite is ""Goodbye Pisces"" and the album closes with the very sad but beautiful ""Toast"". Great disc."
5,One of her best,"From the first album I was interested in Tori's music for its innovative style and poetry. This is one of her best achievements, including the haunting title song. While she makes some effort to disguise her own deep spirituality, it comes through in this song, ""The Beekeeper,"" and others. Then to add ""Parasol,"" ""Ireland"" and perhaps the best of all, ""Ribbons Undone"" makes this a top achievement."
2,beeZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Ohp's was I sleeping?,"First off I am a huge Tori fan, seen her live ,got all her stuff.. This Cd lacks all the catch you off guard screaming, breathing and squeaky voice stuff that I love.. Looks like Sony exec's are trying to make her into something more predicitable and tame.. I only like a couple on this one, boring and uneventful,on a positive note ,like all her stuff it's a well recorded Quaility CD... It must be the work of Aliens .....Ok who are you ? and what did you do with the real Tori?.. Chris"
2,Mommy's not producing like she used to . . .,"Okay, I've had enough of this junk! I worship Tori, she is breathtaking. Her music is like nothing I've ever heard and I support her in everything she puts out there. But, I will be honest this is horrible. Come on Tori, we have been waiting since ""Strange Little Girls"" for some good, harsh, raw, honest, offensive, piano fire like Pele, Choirgirl and Pink. There are maybe 4 songs on this CD of 19 that I can stomach. 3 things cause artists to loose it: getting married, getting sober and having kids. Tori had all 3 hit at once and what a waste! I'm praying the next CD will take us back a little. I read in an interview where Tori said her next CD she's almost completed is old Tori we haven't heard in a while. I hope so. I'm tired of falling asleep to a song about driving in Ireland with friends in a Saab. I mean what's that?"
2,Are you kidding?,"I have been an avid fan of Tori since Little Earthquakes. I really tried to like this CD - but I shouldn't have to try so hard. It's just not that good. She is trying to force her creativity now, whereas it used to come naturally. The cheesy, MIDI sounding instrumentation doesn't help either.Go back and listen to Choirgirl or Under the Pink after this. It is shocking to see how poorly this compares. The beauty, experimentation, moods and pure wildness of her music is all but gone. Replaced by easy listening elevator music, a familiar voice, but a shadow of Tori Amos past, singing with none of her former enthusiasm, lust or passion. Very Disappointing."
2,What's Wrong With Tori?!,"I don't know how long these people've been listening to Tori who gave her 5 stars here. I've been listening to her for a long time since her first solo album. I just don't know what's wrong with her, her albums are like getting worse and worse after The Choirgirl Hotel.Really really disappointed, where's the old, crazy, senual, intimate, emotional, piano girl?! The piano seems like less important for her now, every song sounds similar, same boring beats/drums, yes, it's soft and easy to listen, but less emotion, less powerful, although she's getting extremely fashionable and beautiful herself.If she's just going to choose this way to go for her music, then I can't find a reason to listen to her anymore, I loved her cos' she was different, now...? *Sigh*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~But I'm sure she got more fans now!"
4,A Change,"Sometimes when Tori Amos comes out with a new CD, every track is very 'listenable' right off the bat. Choirgirl Hotel is a CD I could play in the car with my friends, or when I have people over, although it is not as original a concept as many of her other works. However, The Beekeeper is something I would play when I'm alone, or with other Tori fan friends. Some of the tracks take a few listenings-to to understand fully, and some I have yet to grasp. Overall though, I love the CD, and it is interesting to see so many changes in Tori's music--she makes a lot of referances to English life, as well as her voice being more soulful and deep. I also find 'the beekeeper' concept expressed in the CD a wonderful idea. Buy it!"
2,LOVE Tori Amos but find Beekeeper droll,"I agree with Sean from Oakland (wuddup Oaktown??!!) - this album is weak. (Although, I admit, I couldn't bear to give it less than 2 stars, Tori still has that amazing voice and piano skill.) I am not sure I've even been able to listen to it all in one sitting. I've tried everything, downloaded on my computer, my iPod, nothing works, I always end up skipping or deleting the songs. It's quite depressing actually. Tori Amos has become a wife and mother and it's changed her music. What used to be powerful, full of shock and pain, real, has become something silly, sappy, and at times just boring. Oh well. Hopefully she'll be back, I'll keep buying her music just to make sure."
3,A disappointment for Tori fans,"Obviously Tori's fans will buy this album regardless of quality. But we should admit when she slips up. Too many of these songs lack an interesting musical idea at their core and end up being repetitive (""Orange Knickers"" is one example). Of course some tracks are up to Tori's usual quality (the opening track ""Parasol,"" for example) but the album as a whole is too uneven.Tori's vocal work remains lovely.I wish she'd trimmed these 19 tracks down to a more conventional 8-10. When I listen to the whole album, I get bored before the end."
5,"Overwhelming, beautiful experience!","The Beekeeper... A metaphor to life, a metaphor to a superior being (God, Goddess, whoever...), only listening will explain.Tori's 9th album, and 10th production (if we include ""Tales of a Librarian"" here), it's an album full of mellow sounds, of sweet drums and beautiful arrangements. Both, ""Scarlet's Walk"" (2002) and this one, ""The Beekeeper"" turn out to be Tori's most politically charged albums. Scarlet's walk dealt with social and political problems in America after 9/11, and this one besides dealing with relationships, it has a lot to do with wisdom, God, the bible, the church and its lies, female prophets, etc.You'll get caught with all this songs, their stories and the journey won't be complete till you get to the end...My favorites are:- Parasol- Cars And Guitars- Sweet The Sting- Jamaica Inn- Sleeps With Butterflies- Ireland- Toast- Barons of Suburbia- The Power of Orange Knickers"
4,Tori returns with a soulful heartfelt journey,"I am really enjoying this CD, and the more I play it the more I am liking it. She is an ever-evolving artist, and I don't think one of her albums has been a repeat lyrically or musically. But I love that about her. I absolutely love ""Cars and Guitars"" (Track 10) and ""Ribbons Undone"". Both are so upbeat and almost whimsical. I would highly recommend the CD to long-time Tori fans as well as new-comers."
1,WOW!!!,WOW I can't believe what horrible dribble this album is!!!I guess Tori has finaly run out of ideas!! She used to be great....what happened?? This album is so bad it put me to sleep and woke me up again startled at what was coming out of my speakers!!! I thought I was having a nightmare and had to check the CD player as to just what was making that horrible sound???!!! WOW......ps.. if I could have rated this one NO STARS I would have!!
1,Another dud from the Original Drama Queen,"If I could get one message across to Ms. Amos, it would be this: vibrato does not make a good song. After a while it gets plain annoying.Try this... it's fun... stand up (in order to stretch your lungs & diaphragm), strike an operatic pose, start shaking around like you're in an earthquake, and say ""I-i-i-i am-m-m-m Tori-i-i-i-i Amos-s-s-s-s!""LOLYou've just saved yourself $15, the price of this CD.Despite how much I'm disappointed with the demise of Tori's career, I continue to buy her albums in the vain hopes that she'll reclaim the true passion evident in her debut LITTLE EARTHQUAKES. I would say, with the exception of VENUS (an impressive effort), she's been on a constant downward slide. Granted, this album is slightly better than her total bomb LITTLE GIRLS, but it's still not worth the price of admission.And who the heck is that lame loser she sings with on song #3? He sounds like someone needs to refill his bong, man."
2,troi amos,"one i am not singsong writer fan i think the grene is chessey troi i try to like her but i can,t i harder stuff then this i found out about her in high school. i try to like her than i couldn,t i like gothic/prog metal . stuff like that . this is chessy too for me"
1,"Give it up, Tori!!!","Tori has become so unoriginal since 1999 it's not even funny. The Beekeeper sounds exactly like Scarlet's Walk and that's not a good thing. Maybe this album wouldn't be so bad if she didn't put a ridiculous 19 songs on it. If you're the kind of person who likes to listen to 19 almost identical songs sung by someone who sounds like a dying cat, you'll love this album. For everyone else, go buy a William Hung album. At least then you'll be entertained for a few minutes."
5,Tori we Love You!!!!,"Having been a fan from song # 1 ""Crucify,"" Beekeeper continues the wonderful, emotional, spiritual journey we each have with Tori.What can one realy say? - she had done it again. A complex trip that Beekeeper is, makes the journey even that much more satisfying. The range of emotions and thoughts that both the music and words brings me up and down. Yes there are a couple of songs that have me scratching my head - but that's what Tori has been doing to us for over 15 yrs. I love the challenge.To the fans wondering about Beekeeper - no worry. Tori contuies to question, push, and challenge us to grow as she has herself.Enjoy!! Dream and wonder."
5,A True Masterpiece,"This album took a few listens before I really started liking it. Now, I can't get enough of it. There are so many layers to each of her songs and they fit together into this beautiful piece of art, oscillating between different moods. My favorites are Beekeeper, Goodbye Pisces, Toast, and Parasol but I actually *adore* 17 of the 19 tracks."
2,what's inside is not the packaging,"Die-hard Tori fans will of course think they are getting an important work of music, but like Scarlett's Walk this is just another rambling set of unrelated songs packaged as a song cycle. (Tori, if you list the songs in different gardens, why didn't you put those songs together on the album?)And there are too many songs. Even Laura Nyro & Joni didn't release EVERY song they wrote, but Tori seems to think fans will want to hear every little ditty, finished or not. One bothersome quirk about Tori's songs is that many of them don't have an ending,...no conclusion. They just die.This is good background music for when you're doing other things cause there's nothing to pay attention to."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"This album is awful. I love Tori, and she is a musical genius, but wow, this album is just awful. She has so much wisdom and incite as a human being, but she uses all of this uninteresting symbolism, and I just don't feel her. Plus, the production is overdone. The layered voices, Damien Rice--yuck. I wish she would have uncluttered some of the songs and just used her voice and piano. I listened to her play a clip of ""the power of orange knickers"" on her DVD bonus CD. It was quite lovely, because it was her and the piano, not this horrid masking production. I do not recommend this CD--big disappointment."
4,cute,"This is one of tori's best albums, and better than her last couple of newer records. It's really cute and playful. Nothing like ""little earthquakes"" or ""boys for pele"", but worth adding to the collection."
3,It's OK,"The great thing about Tori is that she has creative freedom like very very few artists have these days. She oversees everything from producing to writing to whatever else goes into making an album. Not sure where she was going with this one. Usually her work is very cohesive but I didn't feel it here. Maybe I am missing something. There are a couple of real beauties here like ""Ribbons Undone,"" ""Parasol"" and ""Toast"" but overall my reaction to the album was that it was a little lackluster. Like I have said in my other quite humble reviews of her work, she's my girl and I'm stickin' with her. I will always be curious to see what she does next! That's what's great about Tori, she's very unpredictable and it's the very thing I love about her music."
2,Ho hum,"Although I really admire a lot of the lyrics on this CD, and the shaman's journey she is openly taking... The CD overall just did nothing for me."
3,Too much Tori?,"Tori Amos is amazingly talented musician. Her latest album, however, runs a little bit like her latest live tour...a little too much Tori. There are just a few too many tracks on this album, just as her last concert went about 45 minutes too long. Her songwriting is incredible and many of the songs on this album are beautiful. But, after so many tracks, the songs begin to run together. Get the album, but don't expect to be able to listen to the whole thing actively through one sitting."
2,Produces little honey,2 1/2The once ultra-passionate performer continues to refine an adult contemporary approach to the detriment of her compositional talents; if not for the final quarter of the lengthy indulgence the album could have completely busted.
5,Always Amazing Tori Amos!!,"She did it again, and I love her for it! This is a great album, very mello and happy for Tori!"
2,Her Worst Album Yet,"I Love Tori's music, but this album is the worst by far. Her idea of a garden theme is great, but many of the songs on the album do not follow the garden theme. I also hate how she tries so hard to come off as being sooo European. Singing about Ireland, knickers and such, makes me really dislike the music. She seems to be changing her identity, which is sad. If Little Earthquakes showed us who she was and how she thought, The Beekeeper shows us who she really wants to be--something she's obviously not. Some songs on The Beekeeper are good, but the material is pretty bad and not that enjoyable."
4,The Cornflake Girl's rooted garden,"A new Tori Amos feels like the arrival of spring break - fresh, exciting and full of possibilities. The excitement still continues. THE BEEKEEPER, Tori's 9th album is sublime and haunting. Tori Amos has and ( hopefully ) always will be rooted in what she does best. I don't think motherhood or a change of scenery will change her way of doing things. She's an artist - meaning she will never lose what made her who she is - a great musician and storyteller. The story may be different but I think it still comes from a very deep and sacred place.This album is not her best effort, but still worth it. Allow it to grow on you :-)Best tracks : Parasol, Sleeps with Butterflies, Cars and Guitars, Jamaica Inn, and Toast. Also check out FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL. It's my favourite and Tori at her best."
5,5 Stars All The Way...,"I don't understand all of complaints regarding Tori's latest release. This CD is everything I had hoped for and more. Why are people asking for another album like ""Little Earthquakes""? If you like LE so much, just go and listen to that CD instead.The Beekeeper is slightly different from Tori's previous works but the roots are the same. The melodies are familiar and the beats/vocals are more beautiful than ever.I HIGHLY recommend that you buy the deluxe version of the CD. Not for the interviews but for the extra song Gardland. It is one of my favorite Tori songs ever (and that's saying a lot)."
2,Needs an Editor/Producer Desperately!,"Occasionally, one can hear flashes of Tori's undeniable talent in this album. Then, it is washed out by the severe need for an editor. Obvious in the ending of every song on Scarlett's walk, when she used a little vocal swoop to end (and in my opinion, ruin) the songs, it is that much more in evidence here. Tori is in too much love with herself to edit her own songs (or makeup, or clothes, or self-indulgent book, or plastic surgery), and it really shows through.The limited edition of the cd has really beautiful packaging, which alone is worth half the price of the cd.I hope Tori meets and works with a better producer in the future- I think she could make really beautiful music again if someone could just reel her excesses in.Note that her viral marketing team has requested that her fans leave reviews at places (including a direct link to Amazon), and is giving away prizes to those who leave the most reviews. That's pretty crappy all in itself."
4,Bee Keeper mad a fan of me,"I'm a new Tori fan and bought this album based on what I'd heard about her and what I was able to get from on-line audio clips. This album delivers the mystical quality I had hoped for in the lyrics. I love the edgy combination of musical styles and instrumentation with the the bee/garden theme. They serve the material well. The flow through of themes is well conceived and executed with some fun formatting in terms of the ""gardens"" Amos has planted. The little extras in this spec. ed. version are fun and worth the extra penny."
2,Tori is a sellout,"This album was largely a disappointment. Tori Amos has lost her fire and her style, these songs sound as though they could have been written by any middle aged pop artist. Sounds as though the infamous ""piano humping"" days are over. The songs on the album are divided in the liner notes into ""gardens,"" which is a poor and fabricated attempt at giving the album unity. I wonder how much money Epic Records paid her for her soul."
2,What has happened?,"I am sad that Tori has sold out. This album continues the downward spiral of Tori's creativity and magic. This album is for radio stations that feed the boring masses junk like Brittany Spears. Please, Tori return to the style of Little Earthquakes, Boys for Pele, and Under the Pink. I miss the passion, the memorable lyrics, and the raw emotions you put into those albums. They spoke to me and made me feel your music. I play the Beekeeper for background music since it is pretty."
2,I Long For Her Darker Days,"It hurts me to say I'm not thrilled by the beekeeper, but to me, it merely sounds like Scarlet's Walk's B-sides. I'm happy that tori is at a pleasant place in her life, but come on, there has to be some dark spots left in that twisted heart. From the Choirgirl is tori's plateau, but seriously, there has to be a higher jumping off point than this. I remember the feeling of electricity running through my body when listening to Earthquakes, Choirgirl, Even Venus. Please Tori send more."
4,CD is great! Bonus DVD has no 'music video' promo clips,"Anyone who enjoys lyrics with their music or is already a fan of Tori Amos will enjoy the CD -- The Beekeeper CD music is 5-stars.When I purchased the Limited Edition which has the bonus DVD, I was expecting two ""music video"" promo-clips. They are not true music video clips: Garland is music with still-pictures. The rest of the DVD is Tori Amos explaining her thoughts for each music track -- I did enjoy this. I gave only 4 stars because of my surprise that there were no ""music video"" promo-clips. Had I known this, I would have purchased the CD-only and saved money."
2,Not impressed. Sorry.,"I usually like Tori. A lot. Usually, I don't even need to think twice before buying her new CDs, even if I didn't get to listen to any of it first. But this time, I wish I had.Sure, even the worst song Tori can give us would be a ton better than the best songs other artists might produce, but as a Tori album, this one is as uninspiring as it can get.Sure, the melodies are fun, and so are the lyrics. But as a whole, other than a few gems (such as ""Goodbye Pisces"" or ""Original Sinsuality""), I found most of this album to be rather bland and uninteresting.Maybe its because she seems to be genuinely happy with motherhood and life. Maybe its because she's matured as an artist. I don't really know. What I do know is that after listening to this CD for a few days in a row, I can't find that element in it that would draw me in over and over again (and I tried). It doesn't sound *new* in any way and it lacks the soul her previous albums had in abundance."
4,Still Tori,"Tori Amos never seizes to amaze me. I felt she was in a bit of a slump ever since the ""From The Chior Girl Hotel"" CD......but, this puts her back in the likes of her previous CD's such as: Little Earthquakes and Under The Pink. Thought provoking songs, great melodies, nice piano, and Tori's unique voice. There are 19 songs on this CD - There is plenty on here to like. A lot of songs take you back to the early Tori. A great CD for anyone!"
2,"zzzzzz as the bees would say, but its ok","Okay. She's gotten better with ""The Beekeeper"", it's a bit more mellow, pretty nice choral arrangements on select songs.it's a BIG album that was commercially released that has very little to offer - 19 songs at 80 minutes? come on!Orange Knickers - the worst song off this album. Repetitious, boring, blah.Sure, I think you're a great artist, very creative, but not enough to feed my ears. Would have liked if she had explored her bluesy side and put some oomph into her music. maybe next time.2 1/2 stars"
2,Tori Amos: Cashing In?,"Overall, not a bad album, but gone is that fiery goddess who created songs like Bliss, Cornflake Girl, Sugar, Caught a Lite Sneeze and so on.Where is the old Tori?Of course there is the idea of evolving one's style, but her previous material always managed to fill me with emotion. Sadly these tracks don't offer that same magic. There's no spirit there. I just don't feel her at all.I did like Parasol and The Beekeeper somewhat, but I feel this is her weakest album. So odd, because it sort of follows in the same musical style of Scarlet's Walk, which was brilliant, in my opinion. This album fizzles into contemporary soft rock, which is relaxing, but just not the music of the magic woman I fell in love with."
2,amazing CD + amateur DVD = special edition rip off,"Once again, I am amazed by Tori Amos' lyrics and music. The story she tells in The Beekeeper is simply wonderful, the jacket design is beautifully done and the musical portion of The Beekeeper Special Edition is as moving as her earlier work.However, it is evident that Tori Amos did not have much creative control, if any at all, over the production of the DVD. It was a complete disappointment. The photographs and font used for the Garlands ""video"" are reminiscent of still photographs set to music for a video shown at a Bar Mitzvah. The interviews with Tori contained little substance and the footage appeared to have been stretched out to obtain a very unsubstantial ""30-minute interview.""The highlight of the special edition was the enclosed packet of seeds. For the extra $8 spent in the special edition, I should have purchased a truckload of seeds for my family and friends."
3,and a half almost four,This album is better than scarlet's walk at times but where did Tori go? I love Tori Amos... But the music she is making now seems to be from a happier more toned down Tori... I don't know her personally but I know that she is different witht he past two releases... They are not the same but they are different in a good way.. better? no. Worse? not exactly... but it's a good cd and worth the money it;s Tori!! c'mon...
3,Tori never came from Venus,"I'm a Tori's fan since ""Little Earthquakes"", after that ""Under the Pink"" (the best in her discography) won a special site in my top 10. I followed her music until now, with property I can say that ""The Beekeeper"" is a back step in her career. So slow, so predictible, so unforce that make me sick. There are some exceptions like ""Parasol"". I really miss that Tori in ""From Venus and Back"", a Grammy nominated album. I understand that artists have to reinvent themselves but not like this, The Beekeeper doesn't sound like Tori, maybe she's still in Venus, When are you coming back?; Tori, we are waiting for you!."
2,Disappointed.,"I LOVE Tori! I do not like this album, and that is the first time I have ever been able to say that about any Tori album. It is a huge disappointment especially to follow up ""Scarlets Walk"" which might be my favorite of hers. This is a kinder, gentler, happier Tori. I think the fact that she is growing into motherhood is changing her. There's no pain in any of these songs. There's feeling but it's all gushy and stupid. Way out there even for Tori. I can't even listen to ""The Power of Orange Knickers"" or ""Hoochie Woman"" Tori please don't do anymore duets especially with men!!! There are some good songs ""Cars and Guitars"" is my favorite I really like that song. Hopefully this is just a bump in the road for Tori! I will be first in line to buy her next release."
5,Tori Amos' Beekeeper,"Tori Amos is truly one of a kind and I mean that in a good way. The Beekeper is one of her most creative works to date, ranking with Little Earthquakes. Tori opens up in this album and gives us glimpses into her soul. The album is well worth the while and the money. Also a good listen is Stevie Nicks, Corinna Fugate, and Mindy Smith."
3,"Good, but I was expecting more","Perhaps I expected a bit too much from this book. It was more magazine-like than anything else. Some of the stories/essays included were good, others were of absolutely no interest to me. If you want all the zodiac signs, planetary movement, etc.. then this is good for you. But you can also get that off the Llewellyn Witch's Calendar and get more enjoyment out of it."
3,"Not very ""real"" but fun to read","The text wasn't very much what I expected it to be, but it was alot of fun to look over and read- like a magazine. The covers on these books are very cool."
3,A bit disappointing,"A cover version of ""The In-Crowd?"" Give me a break! This album has some really great stuff like ""Starless Summer Sky,"" but it also has some real missteps. I used my CD player's programming feature on this album. Too many songs that make you go ""ehh..."" This is not up to Crenshaw's usual excellent standards."
5,Another buried classic -- it grows on you,"Well, at first I was disappointed, a little. More for the atmospherics than the music. Before this album, MC was a major label artist, and now he wasn't. The recording quality was a little less than what he'd been giving us. But I pulled this out the stacks the other day and was struck by how incredibly fresh and creative it sounds. And how heart-felt. Of latter-day MC albums, I still think ""Life's Too Good"" is his best (and it's criminal you can't get it anywhere except used), but you could probably make a case for this one and unless you hired Alan Dershowitz, you could win a 5-4 decision at the Supreme Court."
2,There are Better Books Out There,This book is very poorly written and was almost impossible to read. There are better books on this subject. I recommend Black Greel-letter Organizations in the Twenty-First Century: Our Struggle Has Just Begun. It is a lot more insightful and was written much more cleanly.
5,Please support the Legacy and the Vision,"African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision is a book celebrating a wonderful aspect of the college experience for African Americans. It doesn't matter which organization you belong to, this book is dedicated to you. I highly recommend this book and I agree it's about time a nice tasteful book is brought to the forefront commemorating OUR history....not only during black history month, but 365 days a year. Applause!"
5,Yummy,"This makes my brown rice taste good, which means I eat more of it. This is great stuff; just add this and a dash of soy sauce to short grain brown rice :)"
4,Good sound control,This is a good eq for adjusting speaker/sub frequencies for better sound. It cleans up the sound and adds a much cleaner bass hit.
4,"Good ""Book no. 2"" for those just beginning to learn Perl.","This book approaches Perl from a different angle than any other I've read. Instead of teaching the basics, it shows the reader how to use Perl effectively to solve day-to-day problems. Processing web logs, file handling, generating reports from text files and databases, sending and receiving mail, building dynamic web pages, extracting HTML and administrating network. These are just few of the subject this books touches. It also shows the reader how using CPAN archives can save much time (and frustration). Old timers will probably not find anything they didn't already know, but less experienced system administrator will find this book a good help and a time saver. I would also recommend this to anyone wanting to know ""how to use Perl"" as opposed ""how to write Perl""."
2,Nice idea; poor execution,"Although I've used Perl for a while, I like collections like this. I started reading this book and was immediately thrown off by at least one coding/logic error in the encrypt/decrypt programs (which are among the first scripts in the first chapter). The fact that these are annotated multiplies the error, because a newbie is more likely to be misled by the clear explanation of something that is false. This left a bad taste in my mouth, so I've been leery of using the book much since (it's the last one that I consult). Finally, I don't like the author's Perl style. Yes, ""there's more than one way to do things,"" but the style is (IMHO) somewhat non-Perlish and may lead to people missing out on the Perl Philosophy.I recommend the Perl Cookbook instead for recipes, and the Programming Perl book for examples/tutorials."
3,"Less than it might be, but a 4 year old loves it!","This is one of the later Dave Hood efforts, Dave and Becky, not just Dave. Dave Hood is a very good explaner, even when he doesn't appear to completely grasp how things are working he has a knack for putting the right words together so that a child can follow. Unfortunately, the majority of this video is Dave (and Becky) clowning, since they just don't find that much to tell about how mail is sorted, sent and delivered.In contrast to ""There Goes a Firetruck"", say, there is no really strong interviewee, and no really gripping visuals, nothing that can be just watched, like a 100 foot ladder truck being setup and spraying water.None the less, of all the ""There Goes A-"" videos at our local library, this is the one our then 3.5 year old wanted, and so I got it for him. And he can recognize a Post Office LLV (long life vehicle) on the street now..."
4,Very graphic video re U S Postal Services,"Actor/Producer Dave Hood and actress Becky Borg do a great job taking the ""mail"" from the corner mail box from the sender to the addressee (geared for kids 3-8),it gives info not interested to their age groups about the different acroynms and not enough for an older kid ,since it's limited to delivering the mail to ""one residential street""--however Hood and Borg 's antics are the equal of any slapstick comedy with info which is accurate and good to know."
1,Not Helpful,This video purchase was not at all helpful to my understanding of the value of laughter yoga. I felt it was a waste of money. Sorry!
4,Many reasons for the Gettysburg loss,"This book is an overview of Longstreet's life before, during and after the war. It contains very detailed descriptions of what happened during battles of the civil war in which Longstreet was involved. It covers many areas of the battle of Gettysburg in which mistakes were make by the Confederates, and how some things just worked against them. All in all, it denies that the battle was lost solely because of the delays of Longstreet, instead it was a combination of the mistakes of many generals/soldiers that lead to the loss. Longstreet was blamed by many Confederates after the war because of his affiliation with the Republican party, which many Southerners scorned because it represented the Northern government and politics. Longstreet was Lee's ""Old War Horse"" until the surrender at Appomattox."
4,Some say they saved the best for last.,"Is it just coincidence that MSB's last alblum for a major label was released the year I graduated from high school? What would have so many of us done without them. 'You Can't Fight Fashion' has got some of the best music for your ears with songs like 'Hard Time', 'The Damage is Done' (Kevin sure can sing, can't he?), and who can deny that 'My Town' is one of the most rocking songs of all time (266th best single ever made according to critic Dave Marsh [besides, if Stephen King quotes 'My Town' in his novel, it's got to be good!]). Four songs from this release made it onto either one or the other of MSB's greatest hits CD's. My only question is...why isn't 'Just Give Me Tonight' on with the greatest?! What a hit in my book! One more studio LP, Inside Moves, was released in 1986. If you can find it, grab it because it's got three or so really good tunes. Hey, the world just missed the boat with MSB. I'm glad I got on!"
2,CHEAP!!,The materials are really cheap and thin. Definately not what I expected. I should have just gone to a NAPA or AutoZone.
4,Avantalk wirless mini blue too heandsfree headset,"product is excelent and I received it on time, I like it, and I recomend the avantalk company, I will buy from them againe."
2,Prompt refund,"I purchased this item and it arrived damaged. I contacted the seller and received another one in the mail. This, too arrived damaged. I once again contacted the seller and the seller immediately suggested to refund the total cost because of the item arriving damaged. I received a refund back to my account the following business day.Thank You bargain Cell for promptly returning the total cost of the item and doing so without hesitation.."
4,"Good, but I need a little more","This book is full of very helpful information. I believe it could be expanded by including a section for available funds for pre-college educational expenses. My son has Aspergers, Autism, PDD...and we have to send him to a private school to enhance his education. I am sure I am not alone in this category as public schools are overwhelmed by the increase of special kids. Private schools have the small class sizes needed, for a price. Medical benefits do not cover the educational needs. A section addressing this type of funding (grade, middle and high school) would be just the ticket."
5,Great Book!,"A bunch of great stories like the other two, but has better language than the other two IMO."
2,Doesn't Work with Ipod mini,I bought this to use with my ipod mini to use in the car but it lasted only 2 days. After countless adjustments I could not get it to grasp it tight enough and one of the arms broke off. It might work better with another type of device but if you use this with a ipod mini expect problems.
1,Needed it for school,"This isn't something I would buy on my own, I bought it for a class I was taking in college."
5,I can't imagine anyone doing better!,"Mr. Silver's book is a history of the key discoveries in science. Filled with humor and humanity, it entertains as it educates. I'm not kidding about the humor - sometimes I laughed until it hurt!Who would I reccommend this book to? Well, everybody! A reader with a strong scientific background will find it a useful reference, full of names, dates, and figures. Readers who didn't pay that much attention in school will finish each chapter of the book by saying ""so THAT'S how scientists know that!""From the fun footnotes about the little-known quirky habits of some famous scientists, to the easy to understand explanations of terminology, to the fair and equitable arguments about the ethics of applied science today, there's a real treasure of knowledge between the covers.Trust me, READ THIS BOOK."
5,An excellent review of science history to be enjoyed by all!,"I have a personal interest in reading scientific historicals. The true gift of this book's author is his ability to package a great deal of information in each of his well designed chapters. Not only is the factual material easy to read, but the historical and biographical accents peppered thoroughout the book are an added bonus. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the legancy of western science. Those without formal scientific training should not shy away from this book, for there is an abundance of learning to be had by all through reading this wonderful text!"
3,Big disappointment,This works on VERY small areas but not very well. Perhaps it is the blade but i did not get a very good shave with this product. Maybe it works on fine hair but not so well on my coarse facial hair.
5,Absolutely No Problem Tool,This is the only 5 star rating I've awarded any tool. I have used it for several months and a couple of thousand nails and have not had one jam. I have not identified any flaws with this combo set and recommend it without reservation.
4,Great Package,"This is a great package for the weekend warrior, do-it -yourselfer, or professional. The pancake compressor powers all my nailers to drive 16d's at 120 psi all the way down to 3/4"" brads at 30 psi. The compressor is easy to move which makes the upstairs finish work much easier. The finish nailer is a quality tool, its a Porter-Cable. The only negative is the hose supplied with the kit failed (the spring loaded connecter came apart and had to be replace in the middle of a job). Even having to buy a new hose or repair the existing one, the combo package is a great buy."
5,Best Tool I Own Hands Down!,"This combo pack is ideal! I had never owned a Porter Cable product until my father gave this to me as a Christmas gift. My initial attempt at installing crown molding was daunting. Well, after the first piece I was a pro. I have never experienced a tool that has allowed me to raise my DIY skills to such a high level. I feel like a professional. I am now removing the original crown molding that was poorly installed when I bought my house. I plan on replacing all of the crown molding utilizing my Porter Cable Finish Nailer and Pancake Compressor combo and my DeWalt 12"" Combo miter Saw. Two indispensible tools for anyone. Spend the money and finally enjoy projects rather than dreading them. This unit will save you an incredible amount of time. You may want to keep a nail set and a hammer around though as I have had occasional nail heads stick up. However, this only happens about 1 in 50 nails that I've driven."
2,Isn't math extreme enough already?,"The problem with this book is that it assumes kids are involved in or at least interested in so-called ""extreme"" sports. Guess what? They aren't. I know very few 6th graders who are into mountain climbing or base jumping. The whole ""Extreme"" fad has gotten way out of hand. It's not even that bad of an idea for a math book to pick problems that relate more to kids, it's just the extremeness (extremity?) of the book that fails. Maybe try it with sports that people actually play, like baseball or basketball."
5,An Instant Classic,I love that this has the classic versions of the songs as well as the Carly Simon versions. My kids love this CD and we have to listen to it over and over!
5,The pinnacle of gospel quartet music,"This album is the high point of the long and distinguished career of the Swan Silvertones. It is also perhaps the best single album of gospel quartet music.Group leader Claude Jeter was the master of falsetto. In the early Fifties he switched to Specialty Records and reluctantly recruited some hard leads (Solomon Womack, Dewey Young, Robert Crenshaw) to augment his sweet-sounding quartet. At the same time the group moved away from pure a capella singing, adding some unobtrusive instrumentation.The result is the best of both worlds - beautiful harmonies combined with fierce shouting (Young, Womack) and the screamiest lead singing (Crenshaw) I have ever heard. Apparently Crenshaw was sacked from the group for getting happy too quickly in concert. But in a two-minute recording he is perfect.The arrangements by Paul Owens are superb; Jeter is at his best throughout. The great Art Rupe produced.Music to fall out to."
4,Swans Are Beautiful,"The titles ""Keep My Heart"" and ""After While"" were well worth my money. If you like quartet singing and good harmony. This is a must!"
2,"Stupid looking, but a great Autobot","I like it when they sell Jetfires, but this is WAY 2 much. When I bought a recolor of Jetfire,(Overcast) it was kinda awesome. I didn't know Hasbro makes good space shuttles. The color makes a nice Jetfire. His head in robot mode looks dopey. Under it was the Powerlinx logo. It was kind of scary, but every Powerlinx Autobot has them. When my cousin got Prowl, I didn't know he had one. It was under his chest(which looks like a shield)the whole time. The Armada Jetfire's space shuttle mode was more, you know, futuristic. At his chest, there were Capture Claws. Everything was cool except for the head. I love when Hasbro makes them with the visor. But I like it and it is great."
3,Good Quality,"This watch has all of the necessary features I was looking for. I was interested in the temp sensor, but I didn't realize that the sensor was so close to your skin that it recorded body temp. This works great in the summer, but you have to keep it away from your body for several minutes to get an accurate reading in the winter. As a normal watch, it works fine."
1,I have not recieved my product.,I have not received this yet. it was expected to arrive on nov 20. today is december 3rd. Not sure whats going on.
5,Physicists view,"I read this book from the perspective of a scientist and physicist. My main interest is astrophysics. I cannot fault the logic and assertions of the book. The construct of the book flows well and addresses the very essence of the subjects. I believe that the basic idea of the book, that God is real and influences all of creation, is substantiated. The references to current cosmological findings and relating them to the Bible is great. I especially like the discussion on entropy and the same subject discussed in the Bible, with perfect coorelation. A very deep and profound book that requires much thought and study to understand it's fill implications."
1,A misrerable attempt for a book,"This book is based so heavily on the bible that it takes away form what scientist are studying. Poorly written and porly edited, the auther of this book has no idea what he is talking about."
2,Needs a bigger cross on the cover,"Admitting my bias up-front, I got suckered into buying this book by the favorable reviews here so I'm balancing them out with my own. Apparently written to persuade Christianity to accept modern cosmology, it dissolves into illogic attempting persuasion in the other direction late in the work. David Deutsch far better belongs in such a book about physics (or God) than CS Lewis does. Skip this one unless you enjoy being the choir."
5,Recommended reading for skeptics and believers,"I recommend this book to skeptics and believers alike. Only the Holy Spirit can convict, but Heeren makes a pretty convincing argument for the existence of God. He pulls together information from top scientists. It's been some time since I read this book and no longer have it. I lent it to someone who never returned it - I hope he read it!"
2,Very poor understanding of subject material,"This book is best viewed as a source of questions which should be answered rather than a critical analysis of Heinlein. Panshin will, in one chapter, praise Heinlein for the economy of his descriptive prose, while in another chapter criticise him for the dearth of descriptive prose. Panshin introduces very worthwhile topics for analysis of Heinlein (such as Heinlein's extended character dialogues); unfortunately Panshin does not seem capable of addressing the topics he raises. The best review of this book of which I am aware is ""Rah, Rah, R.A.H."" by Spider Robinson, reprinted in ""Requiem: New Colleccted Works by Robert A. Heinlein and Tributes to the Grand Master."" I urge all Heinlein fans to read this book, but I don't expect that anyone will derive significant enlightenment from it"
2,Panshin isn't fit to lick Heinlein's boots,"This book pretends to be objective about Heinlein, but I suspect that this is mostly a technique to try to draw Heinlein's fans away from him. RAH's most important works, such as _Stranger in a Strange Land_, _Starship Troopers_, or ""Gulf,"" are invariably trashed by Panshin. To give one really glaring example of Panshin's bias, when the hero of _Glory Road_ states that he dislikes Vietnamese women because they are small, Panshin takes this as bigotry. Panshin himself notes that the hero here is markedly different from the hero of _The Door Into Summer_, who goes back in time to tell a young girl to meet him in the future and marry him. Somehow, he fails to make the connection--Heinlein, contrary to what Panshin and other critics say, IS capable of creating DIFFERENT characters whose life views do NOT necessarily represent his own. And of course, Panshin's review of ""Gulf"" is one of the worst examples of literary criticism I have ever seen."
1,not micronized,"I ordered ""Life Extension Creatine Capsules Micronized Capsules, 120-Count"" (the picture of the bottle also says ""Micronized""). Instead, I received just Creatine Capsules. Not micronized. Creatine HCL is fine stuff, but I specifically set out to order MICRONIZED creatine, the descriptions said ""Micronized"" creatine, and did NOT receive Micronized Creatine. Hence the low review. It's just not what I ordered."
4,Nice bag,"The bag looks great, especially the pink stitching. However, the bag is larger than I had imagined vertically but the width of the bag is great for putting extra stuff in with the laptop. Overall would recommend the bag to someone else. Have received a lot of great compliments regarding the distinctive bag."
1,"""Take nothing. and use it""","This little book didn't really appeal to me, so I've given it only one star. Perhaps it's because it's not a book Kathryn Kühlman actually wrote - it's not a cohesive work, only a compilation of sermons or messages taken from video- or audiotapes. It's also a bit too conventionally religious to my taste.But I have learnt something of what the Holy Spirit is, something I never used to have any idea of. And I realize I myself have seen people at evangelist meetings that may have been under the influence of the Holy Spirit, people who collapsed on to the floor when ""demons"" were driven out of them. (And then again I may be wrong.)And a statement of Kathryn's I found noteworthy was when she said ""I have no talents. I was born without anything, Nothing! That's the reason it was easy for me to say 'Take nothing, and use it!'""I can't really recommend this book, but many may appreciate it."
4,Solid SF/Fantasy,"This is a wonderful novel about twin worlds that share an atmosphere and what happens when the inhabitants of one world have to abandon it for the other via hot air balloon!! It contains suprising charactarizations and a very cool ecology all wrapped up in a fairly believable page-turning plot. What more could you ask for from SF? This is the first book i've read by Shaw and I now consider him to be one of the better SF/Fantasy authors.His sentence by sentence prose is tight and scans easy. He knows how to describe a scene or scenes well without glutting the reader with oceans of words. He does fairly well with characters and although the protagonist is a bit of a Conan/type, we like him and find him fairly interesting.I found myself remembering scenes days after I put the book down, and that's pretty damn rare. Check it out, if you can find it."
3,Solid Entertaiment,"This is a good, entertaining fantasy/science fiction novel by an underrated author. Shaw wrote a number of good books and stories, many of which can be found in used bookstores. This is the first installment in a series set in an unusual alternative universe. In this world, pi is an even number and it appears that some aspects of physics are different. This is essentially an adventure story set in a solar system in which 2 planets orbit a sun as a pair and share an atmosphhere. The storyline concerns travel, by balloon, between the 2 planets. The basic idea is intriguing though the real differences in physics are never really explored but used a platform for a conventional adventure story. Worth picking up from used bookstores."
4,Works well,My animals were on this throughout the dry summer and through a move from the city to the country and we have had ZERO problems since putting them on it.
2,Still has fleas,My dogs are still have fleas. Maybe they need a stronger dose. It took way too long to ship also. It came in an envelope that was ten times the size of the item. It could have been put in a smaller envelope and sent the next day or the same day like some of the things I order.
3,I guess it's ok,"Hasn't fully worked yet, but it's only been a month. Hopefully witin the next month or two, they will all be gone!"
2,what doesnt work,This won't work if your dogs have access to an area outside untreated for fleas.Better money is spent in trying to find a product that kills fleas on the dogs.This product inhibits their reproductive system-doesnt kill fleas. Let me repeat does not kill fleas.Found this bit of information on the box upon arrival.With a no flea kill product the fleas actually increased on my dogs-Now 43.00 dollars later I've sinceswitched to a topical product which kills fleas-all fleas on contact.
3,lots of flea dirt,"I've only used this product for a one-month cycle. Now, when I comb my cats, LOADS of flea dirt (maybe eggs?) are collected in the flea comb. I still see living adult fleas, however, so hoping they will disappear with the 2nd month's treatment. My cats seem unaware that a tab has been crushed up in their food. Highly recommend 'combing and drowning' several times per week to rid the cats of the stuff that dies.[...]"
3,Worked well for a dog with allergies,This was purchased for my dog who has bad skin issues. We were told to avoid topical flea treatments to not further aggravate his skin. These work great for flea treatment for an allergy prone dog or a pup with sensitive skin.
3,Does it really work?,"Bought this for my dog Maggie,she had fleas really bad.I guess it works,didn't see any fleas after use but she still scratches(ever after 4 months of use)."
1,I am really disappointed.,Good things:1. Even my finicky cat ate it right up with no extra coaxing required.2. None of my cats died or even got sick from the product.3. It was shipped quickly.Bad things:1. It didn't work for more than a week.2. Lots of packaging for little product.3. Cats were extra itchy for the first day.
2,Isn't effective for a whole month.,"I have three cats and two of them hate the drops that prevent fleas, running and hiding when it's applied or when they smell it. Then they try to lick it off themselves and each other. Program seemed like the solution, but they start scratching fleas again about two weeks after taking the pill. I also have tried the mix-with-food Program liquid, but the two drop-hating cats won't eat enough food at one time to consume all of it and won't finish the food later either, so it isn't effective.My veterinarian doesn't carry Program pills and his assistant said it was because they hadn't been effective. I order flea remedies on line anyway because they cost less than at the vet's office, but even the drops seem less effective after a time. The vet's assistant recommended alternating two brands of the drops on a monthly basis."
4,Each product has it's merits and limitations,There's a good article comparing the flea products: [...]The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs. I have a cat and dog. My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it's a heart worm prevention med also. However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa. I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it. So far this combination works perfect for me. Every animal is different. It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically.
5,Only product that works for my dog.,"This is the only product that works consistently for my dog. If you combine ""Program"" with ""Capstar"" your dog's flea problem will be gone! I've tried Frontline so many times, but after a few weeks it doesn't work. I highly recommend this product."
4,So far so good - my dog is MDR1 Positive,"My dog is MDR1 positive (common in herding dogs) so she can't have certain medications, including Frontline (which caused a paralysis of her leg). At a recommendation from other MDR1 dog owners I decided to try this and so far there has been no reaction but it has only been two months. I haven't seen any fleas."
4,Could be better,"I have used this product on our dogs before as it worked wonders. This time, it doesn't seem to be working as well."
4,"cx'd order, but will re-order.","i had to cx the order. service was so polite, i will replace order as soon as i can. 'advantage' no longer works, cat is desperate. this sounds effective. looking forward. thanks."
1,Waste of Money!,"I have a pointer that is highly allergic to fleas so it is imperative that I have a flea control product that works. I have been using the ""spot on stuff"" but it didn't seem to be effective enough. I bought the Program thinking it would be just what I needed to control my dog's fleas. His fleas are actually worse now than they were before. This was a total waste of money for me."
2,Didn't work as intended,"Product claims it will prevent flea larvae from hatching, but since applying a little over two weeks ago, still finding baby fleas and adults."
4,Awesome sound!!,"I discover Gary Flanagan on the Electro Nouveau CD with the single Metro Boulot Dodo. For a moment, I thought it was actually a 80s single they put on there as a retro memory. Then I discovered someone was actually making COOL 80s electro new wave sounds again. What a cool song. Right up there with 99 Luftballoons as great new wave songs I love but don't understand the words! Great stuff. Keep it up.Gary"
5,Refreshing- an excellent read!!!!,"Kingston Phillips' world is turned upside down when her grandmother dies and leaves Kingston her estate in beautiful Jamaica. Faced with giving up what she has worked hard for, jealous family members, and devastating issues from her past, Kingston not only learns to give in to what her heart has been telling her for years, but also discovers that sometimes life is.. Easier Said Than Done! Great job- Nikki!"
2,I guess it worked????,I actually ordered two for my 99 Honda Accord to try to get the engine light to go out. Car ran fine even before installing these sensors. It never did extinguish the light. I think it must be a Honda thing as I probably could have got the light to go out if I let the dealership install their OE sensor at 4 to 5 times what I paid for the generic version.
4,Good price,"I bought this along with the 234-4092 to replace both front and rear O2 sensor for my 98 Honda Prelude. Easy enough to install, and the price is right."
2,Hmmmmm,"Bought this product from Amazon and everything......even made sure it fit my car by entering the year, make and model like amazon has before you buy the product and it said that it fits my car! So I bought it.When I got ready to put it on my car the connecting ends were different. Therefore I was unable to make it work on my car. I got it screwed into the exhaust and everything......its just that it had a ""male"" end on the O2 sensor and so did my car. Last time I looked it was a ""male"" and a ""female"" that go together.I was all excited about getting a MUCH CHEAPER O2 sensor online because they are $73 at a local parts store. But when I actually got it and tried to put it on I had the problem listed above.....which, was VERY disappointing!"
4,A firm book on the life of St. Francis,"St. Francis is someone everyone should know. He is a great mystic and peaceful saint and person. So get this great book if you haven't read about St. Francis.This book is as true as St. Bonaventure's original book but so much more readable. The book stays true to the life of St. Francis and therefore, it is a great and enjoyable read.The author writes of Francis's history, journeys, miracles, preaching, meditation, stigmata and death. The book is very readable and full of postscripts and notes to support the historical truth of St. Francis's life.I rated this book 4 stars because it is not complete without another very unique book titled ""Simple Peace : The Spiritual Life of St. Francis of Assisi"". But, Simple Peace is not complete unless you read a historical account like this book, so read Thomas Celeno's book first, then search for Simple Peace."
3,Fair - play costume,I thought this product would be more durable than it was. The netting around the skirt tore right away and isn't fixable. Basically my daughter got about 3 weeks worth of play out of this dress before it was ruined and I had to sew on it to make a new silk-type skirt (which wasn't easy).
1,Waste of money,"This is an absolutely terrible 45 minute UNauthorized audio cd that consists of 100% cheese. The seven tracks start with Robbie saying one or two sentences, then a British woman narrates his life story while an electric piano plays in the background--the music is not Robbie's, but incidental music written by an unknown.No Robbie music, almost none of Robbie's voice, and a bio that's straight out of any British rag. Don't waste your money."
1,100% cheese,"This is an absolutely terrible 45 minute UNauthorized audio cd that consists of 100% cheese. The seven tracks start with Robbie saying one or two sentences, then a British woman narrates his life story while an electric piano and drum machine play in the background--the music is not Robbie's, but incidental music written by an unknown.No Robbie music, almost none of Robbie's voice, and a bio that makes him sound boring. Resist the temptation."
4,Longer view time of Nody,"It was great to get my hands on this DVD of Noddy. It is usually less than 10 minutes on the sprout channel, she can watch this DVD and I can get dinner ready without interruption."
3,overrated,"This is definetly not Gangsta Pat at his finest. It's alright, but definetly not worth what it's selling for here on Amazon. If you just have to spend a bunch of money on a Gangsta Pat album then do yourself a favor and go buy Deadly Verses. That was by far his best album, and worth the money."
1,Half of the pages were missing!!!,half of the chapters were actually ripped out of the book...I did not notice until i went to use it for my class & by then it was too late to return! what a joke!!! so deceiving & unethical!!
5,A truly captivating childrens book for all ages to be!,"I have reviewed this book from my child's school library and have been very entertained and impressed with Mr. Wilson's writing techniques. My daugther and the children in my four and five year old class were simply mesmerized with The Day Jesus Came By. It is such a pleasure for the children to be able to relate and understand so clearly Mr. Wilson's writings. It has been a pleasure to read a good clean book. I can feel comfortable and proud to own this book in my home for all that enter in to view and read. The story of how even animals know who Jesus is and how even the natural instincts of the cat, to harm the woodland creatures, was changed when the cat saw Jesus---such an event filled, soul inspiring story to be forever remembered and charished!"
1,Poorly Made,I was eager and excited to watch this video until I started viewing it. It is so poorly made. It looks like videos I take when I am on vacation. Very disappointed.
3,Still seeing fleas,Used this along with Advantage. My cat still appears to have some fleas. I live in FL and we've had a warm winter. The fleas seem to be somewhat resistant to just about everything.
3,I would have rather skimmed though it at Borders instead,"Very poorly and inconsitently written book. It seems that the author just couldn't make up her mind on whether she wants it to write it as an academic paper, a ""how to"" book you might see on a shelf at Kinko's, or a coffee-table book.It does offer some very insightful ideas, but they are so broken up in chapters that don't flow with each other, that can't keep up the interest of the reader.Also, I would have changed the title to ""observations on the effects of facial configurations in the everyday society"""
5,"Bungling, I think, lazy","This book is absolutely a perfect example of why we have been attacked without any clue. Understand that when you are the worlds most popular person,, Osama Bin Laden or small time as D. Webb who has given out his address publically and kept it up to date for 7 years, and the FBI can't find these people, it is since the Fed's need to get off that thing! Enloy this book, it is excellent. Read Karl Mark Maddox, it helps explain why."
4,Great for Basic Syntax,"Fitting, seeing that it is an introduction. For an introduction, however, it does not go into too much detail on some topics. The point still gets across though. Provides excellent exercises at the end of each chapter."
3,Beck Arnley 101-4025 Ball Joint for Mk II (90-95) MR2,"The ball joint needed modification to fit properly. The top of the ball joint was too large to fit into the steering knuckle.Since I had a grinder it was no big deal, but someone without the right tools would have had to send them back. The holes for the bolts were also not quite right and I had to drill those holes a little larger as well."
4,On your knees,"This book is very helpful for a newcomer to the northwest who wants to know what will work in this region. While not complete, it offers an easy to reference guide to trees and shrubs."
5,A great book for beginners like me.,"This book shows you the basics. It is very easy to understand and follow. The illustrations are great. There are several different dyeing ""experiments"" ranging from easy to more difficult in the book. Hand-Dyed Fabric Made Easy provides good resources and information on where to find the items you need. I highly reccommend this book."
3,Hand-Dyed Fabric Review,"This book was descriptive enough as far as actually dyeing the fabrics, but I felt that it lacked a basic tool - which is a color wheel. Just by adding a section pertaining to mixing and creating new colors, it might have made for better reading."
1,"BUYER BEWARE! Not a ""Soundtrack!"" Mediocre Covers!","In a word, these are awful covers of the real thing. The CD cover says it all: ""This album contains cover recordings: selections not pformed by the original artists."" Any questions?"
5,Only thing that works for my poodle,"My 9 pound poodle has very sensitive skin and a sensitive stomach. Every other indigestible flea medicine caused him to be sick to his stomach. Topical solutions made him act crazy-hyper and nervous and reddened his skin. Also, nothing kept fleas off of him, including Frontline Plus! This is the only medicine that has worked to keep fleas off and doesn't cause him any side effects."
5,Program pills,"I've been using these Program pills for years, and they do a fine job of keeping my dog flea free. Buying the pills on line is much less expensive than purchasing them from my veterinarian's office."
2,"An Introduction to a truly ""Magnificent Obsessesion""","This is a purported ""prequel"" to ""Magnficent Obsession"" which Douglas wrote earlier. He says in the introduction that he is writing in response to requests from many readers who wanted to know more of the motivation of Dr. Hudson. Unfortunately, Douglas either won't (or mare likely can't) say.Douglas was a generally Protestant minister, influenced by the mid-century liberalism of his time that caused him to approach the promise of Matthew 6:3-4, but then back away at the last moment. So, this book is disappointing. You expect that he will explicate the promise fictionally, but he never does.While he was popular with the undifferentiated liberal Protestantism of his time, his writing doesn't hold up well. The characters are wooden and the overall treatment of the Biblical premise unsatisfying.Go to the original -- any number of commentaries on Matthew 6:3-4. Douglas' pale reflection doesn't work."
5,Sent to friend,"This is an old, old book read many years ago. A friend browsed through mine and hoped for a copy.I was delighted to see it still available on Amazon and able to send it to him.Thank you,Betty Wilson"
3,Gumbo Ya-Ya,"I first saw this book when I was a kid. I am a native of New Orleans. I was always facinated by the old Cajun remedies for various ailments, like roasted rat for bed wetting. We have since purchased 2 copies to give to friends and family. We still have the original hard cover, which was my mother's."
5,favorite bones,My sister's dog Maggie will only eat these bones. They are great for her teeth and keep her entertained :)
5,Wanna see my tattoo?,"As a fan of Denise on the conference circuit, I was delighted to see that the book she has written digs deeper into the branding phenom than she can in a one hour presentation. Her sense of humor is great and the book is a must read for a cutting edge marketing person. I am in the marketing business at a credit union...I know...fun...FINANCIAL! Well, believe me, Denise recognizes that branding can cross over to the other side and it can balance on the edge if you just let it happen!The brand is the future and we all know and love several of the companies that brand us everyday (as I sit sipping my Starbucks and listening to my I-pod...).Simply put, buy the book, it is great and you too will be a fan of Ms Wymore.Thomas Bowen-"
4,Great for protecting discs,"What can I say, it's as advertised. On time, functional and devoid of flaws. Really not much else to say."
5,Works Great!!!,I wish they came in fashion colors!!! Like Hot Pink!!! But they are very functional and well-made! They keep your discs protected! We own at least one in every size!
3,Works as expected,Works as expected. Works as expected. Works as expected. Works as expected. Works as expected. Works as expected. Works as expected. Works as expected. eeee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee e e e ee
4,Terrifying and Graphic,This movie was crazy! When I first started watching it I was skeptical but from the beginning the movie drew me in. I love horror movies but am rarely scared. This movie scared the crap out of me. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is ready for a real horror film.
1,Terrible,The movie wasnt some teen slasher like i was expecting. It was made in the 60's or 70's and theres a reason no one has ever heard of it. It was no good. Dont buy
1,"Re-Hashed movie, free elsewhere","This is a poorly pieced together product. It's re-hashed from an old movie (re-named). I am a big fan of B-grade horror movies, the worse the better (Just saw a great re-master of MANOS here in LA).Thus far, this is my favorite little movie from the past few months:Roadside MassacreWhy? It is a low-budget B grade horror movie, but there is no trick. You aren't suckered into buying something and dissapointed. ROADISDE massacre is a fun horror movie that is made by people who love the genre and made to be an hommage to the great horror movies. It's also funny... And quite well made (given budget, etc).Night Nurse Massacre tricks you into renting it, you realize you blew money on something you could have found elsewhere for free. Honestly, the artwork isn't even that good.I like Amazon becasue we can all be honest."
2,the story or characters had no purpose,I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has any kind of taste.Do not waste your time with this one.
3,Great old movie,"The information is misleading so let me clear up a few points, this is a late 70's early 80's movie despite the year they show as released. It is a old style psycho thriller where the bad guy isn't really bad just crazy and the victims are just that victims. I don't have to worry about giving away the story because there isn't really a story. Drifter is allowed into the house of off duty nurses and where he proceeds to kill them off one by one. Unlike stories of today this crazy simply hates women because his wife slept around on him. Not a great movie but good for the time it was made"
1,Slow to start and did not have enough punch when it did get started.,As I mentioned it was slow starting and when it got to the beef of the story it seemed to be very weak.
1,dumb,"What a dumb, boring movie. Old quality, very poor story line. Not even the full frontal nude scenes can hold your attention. Don't waste your time with this one. Even the front cover pic for the description on Amazon is better than the whole movie."
1,Real Crap,"I like 'cult' and/or hard to find horror gems. This one is not a gem at all. Bad acting, bad script, bad story. Bad, just bad."
1,You'll regret watching Night Nurse Massacre!,"I generally enjoy B movies, but not this one. It's not suspenseful, quirky directing, and criminally demented behavior are a few reasons to avoid exposing yourself to Night Nurse Massacre. I'll probably not finish watching it."
3,Too fragile,I have to agree with several of the reviewers. This item will not last the test of time.. The glass is very thin and fragile... as evidenced by the folks receiving these with defects out of the box.If you are not into style... you might be better off buying a Pyrex measuring cup and using it for drinking tea :-)... really.
2,Meh,"Flimsy glass not sure if Adagio site has the same raving reviews about it and though I'd buy it with the Ingenuity tea pot. The base is the same thickness as the walls making it very fragile, most cups meant for hot beverages have a reinforced base this lacks it.After placing the cup on my desk for 2 days I realized the base gets scratched and displays a ring formed by the glass and desk rubbing. Some sort of integral base for the cup would have fixed it. Lastly it needs a slightly bigger handle this thing is designed for people with five pinkies.Arrived with a cute dimple of the tip, wasn't really impressed with the quality.Adagio should stick to teas, tea-ware especially glassware is terrible."
1,Easily Chipped,The mug arrived with a large chip out of the handle leaving a jagged edge and rendering it unusable.
4,"Loved it, for a short period of time.","My wife really enjoyed this tea glass mug. It was washed and some how got cracked in the dish dryer. Not sure if it was bumped, I guess it was really fragile."
3,"Nice mug, but fragile","I like this mug. I received it as a gift for Christmas. Mine came with a lid. Unfortunately I broke the lid soon after I got th gift. I use the mug regularly; not quite daily, but now I see a crack in it (others have mentioned that). I know that the crack was not originally there though. I'm disappointed that it's now cracked and I'll continue to use it until it falls apart. I've only had it for 4 months. It is obviously fragile and I need a sturdier mug."
2,Poor handle and watch out if the liquid is hot,"Well, looks cool but the skinny handle is almost useless. You have to hold it just right to prevent your fingers being pressed against the thin, and thus hot exterior. It they would angle the lower end of the handle more in an manner that lessens the arc and runs straighter towards the bottom of the mug it would work much better and keep you fingers away from the hot surface when drinking hot tea of coffee."
3,Ok but very thin glass,"I got this mug with the IngenuiTEA teapot. The teapot is great, the mug however is sufficient, it fits under the teapot, but it is very thin glass and fragile."
3,A candy favorite,The candy bar itself is one of my favorites. Has all the items that I would want in a bar except I would prefer dark chocolate to the milk chocolate.The packing was bad. It came with bottle of lotion. One end of the box was mashed making bars on the end mashed together. The lotion had leaked out an inch of lotion making a sticky mess. I didn't report it but was surprised this happened. A first for any item I ordered from amazon.
5,Love it!,"I have been keeping Speckled Sussex Chickens and Guinea Fowl for several years. My friends are tired of hearing my chicken stories and no one ever tells me any so I picked this up to hear someone else's story and boy is it a hoot! Well written and easy to read, the author keeps your attention as easily as a novel. The stories are real, I know because I've lived some of them, and the information is accurate. I even learned some things I didn't know. I've found myself quoting it many times. Excellent!"
3,good story - not enough info,"I did enjoy the story aspect of this book, but I was dissapointed by the lack of information. Although the information it provided was helpful, I was looking for more. It did make me laugh and (almost) cry. I think it is a perfect book to introduce those that are thinking about raising chickens. If you are looking for only information on the matter, then this is not the book for you. Also, I am not really into British humor, so that threw me off a bit too. Warning, there are a few swears in the book for those who don't like that kind of stuff."
2,"If you are serious about raising chickens, do not waste your time","Yes, the book is pretty accurate about how you go about your daily life raising chickens. However, there is not enough information on actual raising chickens. Chickens are not just pets. You can't take them to a city vet, since they won't know what to do with it. It doesn't tell you how many hours a week it takes, how much the feed will cost for X number of chickens for a year (layers vs. broilers), it doesn't tell you anything about raising and nursing baby chicks or working with an incubator. It's funny, it's easy reading. However, I wouldn't waste time reading. If you have raised chickens for years and did fairs, this book won't add any information. If you just want a funny story for 2 hours, then it's ok."
5,Incomparable,This album brings back memories of a very classy lady having met her when I was 5 years old and watching her rehearse-have also seen her in concert. These are songs that I remember.
4,"KUNG FU: HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNIQUES","A general introduction to Chinese martial arts. David Chow, the first technical advisor of the ""old"" 1970s ""Kung Fu"" TV series, and his attempt to answer all the mail he received as it became the number one TV show in the US."
4,"Good historical, philosophical overview of Kung Fu styles","I really enjoyed reading this book -- it has something for everyone. I've re-read parts of it several times already. From historical background on many popular Kung Fu styles, to detailed descriptions and photographs of David Chow performing Chin Na techniques. From interesting reading on Kung Fu philosophy and wisdom to discussions on the Westernization of Kung Fu. An outstanding buy for the price, IMO."
4,"Great book, loads of info. Actually I give it 4 1/2 stars.","I have been stuying Kung Fu for over 12 years now and learned some things from the book that I previously didn't know. The book covers Kung Fu origins/some history, philosophy, review of styles, including a section on Chin Na with pictorial. Most interesting were the different Kungs in the back of the book. The authors even told you how to practice them if you are dedicated enough to do it.The only thing I didn't like was the large section in the middle devoted to what looked like basic Chin Na. It would have been better without that section, but the descriptions of the Kungs made up for it. I still think though that this book is a must for every martial art library.VERY GOOD BOOK - 4 1/2 STARS."
3,limited overview of chinese boxing culture,"This is a good book for someone just starting to explore martial arts. Chow gives historical information about the origins of chinese martial arts (legends included), brief overviews of the more mainstream internal and external chinese boxing styles, some chin na techniquue, chinese philosoophy and training methods and disciplines. Has a cool section on some obscure styles of martial chi kung. Also talks about the spread of martial arts into western pop culture. This book helped me get started in kung fu and provides a lot of information about chinese boxing. I only give it 3 stars because the information held within the book is limited and common place upon further study of chinese boxing."
4,"Kung Fu: History, Philosophy, and Technique",This book is aged but I was glad to make it mine. Something time honors is the martial arts. There is much to gain from this manual.
5,Excellent hands-on coverage,"This is *the* authoritative text for those who are new to security or wish to enhance their existing security knowledge. The hands-on, exercise driven approach is extremely effective at teaching the material. I have seen John Millican speak at SANS and have always been impressed with his ability to dive deep into security issues while explaining it simply and elegantly. This book is particularly helpful because of the broad range of tools it covers, and the multi-OS perspective that it takes on the matter.A must-have for those who are serious about learning security."
3,No time spent proofreading this book,"This book presents some welcome hands on exercises to learn about security. However, it is very clear that at no time did anyone sit down with the book and actually try out the exercises before the book was published. The result is that many of the exercises simply do not work as written and much time is spent simply troubleshooting the steps.Apart from the poor quality control of this book, it lacks good solid explanations to accompany most of them. Like many such exercise-oriented book the minimal level of explanations leaves one feeling that they are merely following a recipe in a cookbook.In summary, while the book offers something that is missing in the marketplace, it seems that is was rushed into print with little quality control. Unfortunately there are no errata sheets available from the publisher."
1,Not current,"Having studied 5 other texts in preparation for the set of exams that are based on security I can honestly say that the having current information is very important. This text was published in 2002. Much has changed in technology in the last 10 years. Although some of the software described inside are still in use, it is necessary to consider this something other than a genuine guide for passing the exam. This publication can be used to point you in the right direction but it will not prepare you for the exam because of the ubiquitous nature of the contents. I found this fact to be a deal breaker for me. I am using other texts to study from and the fact is I gained very little from reading this book. That being said It was well written and was probably awesome 10 years ago."
1,WHACK,"I thought that it would give more insight, what I found you can tyoe his name in any search engine and find that stuff. I thought that this would talk about him as an author. BOOOO!"
3,Get it for free at any public library!,"You can get this same article for free at any public library, don't buy it! It's not an article for fans, it's for literary critics who use biograpical information to analyse literature. If you're going to write an essay on Hugh Laurie, go to the library and get this article. If not, don't waste your time. Go to the IMDB website."
2,Pretty dull read,"A friend recommended it, and I read it, but I didn't find that it told me anythign I didn't already know. Car sales people are negotiators. And they stink at it. Big wh00p. Already knew that!"
1,A great disappointment,"I expected a lot from this book, based on the previous reviews. Neither the style nor the substance lived up to those erroneous expectations. The style is boring, mildly irritating. The ""jokes"" are not funny. The examples? Weak. The substance? Same ""truisms"" found in any basic book on negotiaiton. I have read many recent books on negotiation, such as Negotiate your way to riches by Peter Wink, Gain the edge by Martin Latz and The streetsmart negotiator by Harry Mills. All of them are pretty bad and I honestly cannot tell which one is the worst of them all, but this one is a serious contender."
5,Practical Easy Read,"I teach negotiations all over the world and this is the book I like to recommend. I also like ""Negotiate This"" by Herb Cohen and ""Predictably Irrational"" by Dan Ariely. I have read so many negotiation books written by professors. While most are enlightening, they are mostly difficult to read. These 3 books are enjoyable to read so I have typically handed out this book as something they students should read when I teach and recommended the others. However, I teach negotiations for an oil company, not at the university, so my style is quite a bit different."
1,Bad quality,Itema size is small for a 3\4 bad quality looks cheep for the price it has. I dont recommend this item.
3,what happened to the scratches?,"This record contains of just instrumental beats. If you see the name dj faust on the cover you would expect some turntable manouvres, but this ain't the case. I quess nowadays dj/producers are getting lazier by the day. Beats sound ok, but nothing new and exiting."
5,Better Option,"Before you choose an oral flea medication do some research. Dogs lives are shorter than they used to be, heartworm medication, flea medication, injections....they take their toll. This is a better option than the alternative oral flea meds, the local spot meds and oh no the killer flea collar. It takes a up to six weeks to break the flea cycle, then it is wonderful. I saw great results in two weeks and after four nearly flea free and I live in a high flea zone."
3,Program flea control,I gave Dottie her first dose a month ago. I have been bathing her twice a week with flea and tick shampoo to get rid of the active fleas. The Program should be keeping the eggs from hatching but she is still itching and scratching. I will finish what I bought but don't know if I would buy it again.
5,Best product I have found for long term flea control with 3 large dogs !,"Three large dogs makes flea control a challenge in our sandy/grassy yard. First you have to eradicate the fleas in the environment using lawn insecticide and get them off the dogs with flea shampoo or Capstar. Then the PROGRAM keeps any larva fleas from developing into adults and pretty soon any remaining fleas on the ground just sort of fade away. And, as long as you do not have other animals/pets bringing fleas into the yard, you have a good control solution. We let the dogs into the house occasionally and NO Fleas after 12 months now of using PROGRAM. Also, an important point to me is that PROGRAM is very benign, in that it contains no insecticides. The literature says that there is no known overdose of PROGRAM that would harm a human or a dog. However, PROGRAM does not protect against ticks, so the dogs also wear a flea collar."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I have heard great reviews about this over the past few years, so thought I'd try it. My vet said it was no good, but I thought aww, since he doesn't sell it. It's not as pricey as other flea products so thought I'd give it a try, since the part of the country I live in seems to be a flea resort.LOLI did try it and it seemed to work as a fertility drug with fleas.LOLThe package did say you had to use Capstar or another flea killer with it in order to get it under control, which I did, but it certainly didn't do any good, and I went back to my old product that does work, although more expensive.To me, if you have to use Capstar and 1/2 dozen other products to get Program to work, it's not worth it, and certainly isn't going to save you any money, that's for sure."
1,Program Flavor Tabs,"When I received Program, it was so old, it didn't have any potency and didn't work at all. I followed all instructions and treated adult fleas with spot treatments. My dog continued to have fleas. How do I know that the Program I received was old? It had disintergrated to powder."
3,One big package,"NP has carved their own dirty niche in rock. Using formulas in everything from their stage show to their lone album, the tried but true actions pay off live but come up short on record (like the early Who and the Doors). Clocking in at only 27 minutes, NP uses clever hooks and the usual bag of ""momma's gonna hate this"" words and subjects that may have been new in 1977, but aren't too threatening in 1998. The live shows come off much better as NP is a full metal assault on all 5 senses. Using just sound and sight in buying this album is far too limiting for on the edge circus act that has a lot to offer in this age of preprogrammed electechtronica."
4,Yeehaw,"Rock and roll the way it was meant to be- raw, loud and fast. Oh yeah, and with two blond amazon guitarists who breathe fire. Short on chops but still tight. Over the top energy and attitude."
5,One of the best and most beautiful biographies I've read lately...,"I loved this biography for its depth and fascinating insight into the perplexing and most complicated life of Isaac Newton. What an interesting and extremely devoted man. He immersed himself in science to the exclusion of nearly all other interests and relationships, and found himself very alone in his pursuits. However, as most men and women of powerful intellect, he was driven by the need to prove his theories and to understand the Creator's world.Christianson explores Newton's deep Christian feelings and beliefs, his political ideas, and his scientific discoveries and controversies with extraordinary precision and elegant language. This is definitely the best biography I have read this year (2007). I'm so glad I invested the time and money in this glorious and inspiring biography of a never-to-be-forgotten genius!"
5,Program - flea controller,"Program is a stock item in my home with my dozen cats. Because it sterilizes any flea that bites the cat, it keeps the fleas from infesting. It is easy to give, the cats will eat it mixed with tuna, and it is not toxic to the cats."
1,Difficult and Messy...,"I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house. I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away. I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth. It was messy, they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it. I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats."
2,"Cat oral flea medicine- "";Program""","The company Shipped it immediately. All 3 Cats ate the food I put it on without incident or detection. Unfortunately the product didn't seem to work. All three cats still had active fleas. I bought it because I have one cat who us still very feral and difficult to get close to. I can't speak to if it would work with repeated doses or not. I waited the month brushing with flea combs, and managed to get frontline on the cat and others and fleas were down to a minimal within a day. I wouldn't buy this product again. Perhaps there is a way to use it more effectively and if you have a cat you can't get close to, anything is better than nothing and you should try, but if it doesn't work, nothing costs much less than anything."
3,flea control,"This product was given mixed reviews by my cats;one cat loved it, one wouldn't even try it and the tird cat ingested about half.The problem with a flea control product that is mixed in with pet food is that the success is based on how finicky your pet is. Oh well, it was worth a try."
4,finally,A product my cat can stand. Works well and is very easy to administer to a picky eater. I'll be ordering more
1,waiting for refund,"After the company ships for the second time without getting it right I'm still waiting for my refund. They sent tablets for dogs instead of suspension for cats. TWICE! And when I talked to a representative the second time, he tried to tell me that the tabs for dogs was suspension (liquid). I would be careful if you decide to order from this company."
1,Use Topical this is no good!,"This is a liquid that you are suppose to put on the cats food and you have to make sure they eat it all--a cat--chances are slim. It also only kills flea eggs not adult fleas, don't waste your time use Advantage it works great! The discription from this seller wasn't truthful, I sent it back!"
3,Liquid form now,"The new Program flea control medication is in a liquid form that you mix into your cat's wet food, which makes dosage very tricky. My cats did both eat the food mixed with it, however one of them did not finish his bowl. As a result, I don't know yet if he got enough of the medication for it to work.As an aside, it smells like lotion or something else unappetizing, although this didn't seem to deter my cats. The previous Program (for cats and dogs) was a 'flavor tab' which is like a big kitty treat. They both seemed to like the taste of that, however it could be hard for them to eat since it was a little larger and heavier than their other treats."
3,Fleas are going away,I will definitly continue to try this. the fleas are leaving and dying by the hundreds but they are still there hopefully within a few months they will deminish all together :)
2,Program flea prevention,"I don't know what is going on with the fleas this year. They seem to be impervious to prevention medication. I tried Revolution, which worked for one month, and then stopped working. Advantage did nothing and Program is the same. My cat's ears look polka dotted with some bleeding sores unless I keep him inside. At least I don't have fleas in the house."
5,Satisfied Customer,Product arrived promptly and was even better than expected for the price-point. Assembly instructions were easy to follow; everything needed was there and fit perfectly. It looks great in my corner!
4,Corner Baker's Rack with crystal & wine storage,"Perfect for a small space.Handy man type was needed to redrill some of the holes which were on the wrong side of metal pieces to be connected. However, the final result was well worth the effort."
4,Great in the kitchen!,"Great in the kitchen! Would be nice if the spaces between the metal bars were closer. Otherwise, it's a great wine rack! We use the top 2 shelves to hold the wine opener as well as storage space."
5,Perfect for needs....,"I love this item. I had always wanted a baker's rack and when we got our new house, I wanted to purchase one. This item fit the space perfectly, is sturdy and easy to put together. Best of all, it looks great!"
1,Beware of substitutes,The KD 2551 Universal heavy duty universal wheel hub puller is NOT a K-D Tool product and 2251 is NOT a K-D part numberRather this is a copy made by HTI Hand Tools International a Taiwan CorporationThe copy is made of rough poorly finished and fitted castings that do not fit together.I emailed K-D Tools Apex Tool Corp. and they confirm that this is not their product.I have returned the knock- off for a refund but have not yet received a refund from ReStockitBeware the picture on the ad is of the genuine tool what is shipped is something else.
5,Must read for those interested in Wright or Buffalo,As a owner of dozens of books about Wright and having spent countless hours learning about Darwin Martin this book is an extraordinary glimpse of not only the Client relationship but of the enormous growth of Buffalo business at the turn of the century. The quality of each photo is worth the purchase price alone
1,Very boring and basic,"When i saw the cover i jumped to by this book, but after buying it I realized that i was a complete waste of time and money. There is just very little content and material that is useful to anyone with the slightest knowlege of hockey. It might be alright for the beginer, but beyond that level DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Product not compatible.,"I am sorry I can not give a review as the product is not for the Palm I have.I would appreciae advise on process to return it.The package was not opened,as I could see that the prongs were different than on my Palm."
3,Didn't work,"Cable didn't work for my treo 700p. When plugged into the phone, the computer played a weird sound. The computer knew the cable was there, but it wouldn't sink with the phone. I'm not entirely sure it is the fault of the cable though, I think there are other computer/phone related problems on my end!"
1,"You can do better than this, NFL.","When thinking of classic Cowboys wins over the Redskins, we think Staubach, White, Theismann, Dorsett, Riggins, Pearson, Monk. It's simply what we want: the games we lived and died for on Sunday afternoons as kids. An era where Brent Mussberger would say ""...You are looking live...""Here we have games from '97, '99 and 2007. Really? The closest thing to a ""classic"" game between these two teams over the last 20 years, in my opinion, is the 1992 season opening win over the Super Bowl Champion Washington Redskins on Monday Night. Dallas rolled the champs lustily 23-10 in what was the kick-off to Aikman, Smith, Irvin era. But that game isn't here, as well as a few other glaring omissions.The games on this DVD set are good for Cowboys fans to have in their collection, to be sure. But it's a far stretch to use them as examples of the best of this rivalry."
1,Horrendous Choices,"First of all, the rivalry between the Cowboys and Redskins was born during the Tom Landry / George Allen era. So to not have games from the 70s and early 80s is unforgivable. The bitter hatred between Roger Staubach and Diron Talbert and also between Harvey Martin and Joe Theismann. The Clint Longley Thanksgiving Day miracle and also Staubach's last game against the Skins should be #1 and 2 on this DVD. As big a fan as I am of the Boys, I am saving my money on this. That's too bad. Great idea but badly chosen games."
3,australian cowboy,"Any die hard cowboy fan will worship the flashy aikman smith and irvin era......and as I say the real backbone of the 90's dallas era woodson , novacek , johnston and eric willaims. Unfortunately this dvd doesnt feature all of the greatest of games or players but you will buy it anyway because your a cowboy fan not a weagle or a low IQ giannnt or a wredskink. We are americas team fans and we rule. Remember God left a hole in the roof of irving texas stadium so he could watch his team play.Australian Cowboy Fan"
5,"""Punks"" that like Blink 182 will HATE slapshot...","Forget the imitators, Slapshot is THE Boston straight edge band. Anyone currently on the American Nightmare jock, take note: these guys not only did it first, but they did it louder, faster and meaner. If you can listen to this album all the way through without stomping a hole in your living room floor, you need to go buy a Sum 41 record... er, cd."
3,"Would be four and a half, but considering your options...","This CD would get four and a half stars, just for all the classics songs that are on it. Problem is, the production value, while not terrible, lacks punch, and the recording volume is very low. However, Slapshot's 2002 release, Slashes and Crosschecks, has all of the standout tracks from this album: ""I've Had Enough,"" ""No Friend of Mine,"" ""Step on It,"" ""Hang Up Your Boots,"" ""No Time Left,"" and ""In Your Face,"" plus 16 other awesome Slapshot tracks. Not only that, but the SAC tracks are rerecorded and remastered and, to my ears, completely blow away the originals. You also get digital versions of live performances. I'm not knockin' Step On It, it's a great album, but considering what you can get on Slashes and Crosschecks for the same amount of dough, you're better off buying SAC."
5,ANOTHER GREAT TAPE IN THE SERIES,"MY 3 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS VIDEO.IT EXPLAINS WHAT PARAMEDICS DO IN AN EMERGENCY,AND DOES SO AT A LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING FOR CHILDREN.DAVE AND BECKY SHOW CHILDREN THE INSIDE OF AN AMBULANCE AND EXPLAIN THE EQUIPMENT.THE TAPE ALSO TAKES CHILDREN TO THE BEACH TO SEE LIFEGUARDS IN ACTION! IT ALSO EXPLAINS FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE TRUCKS ROLES IN AN EMERGENCY.DAVE AND BECKY MAKE IT FUN AND ENJOYABLE FOR THE KIDS"
1,SO bad!,"I am so glad to have gotten this from the library, and not purchased it. My kids loved the emergency vehicles, but the Laurel and Hardy routines by the two ""stars"" Dave & Becky were very, very annoying. Stay away!"
5,A must have for your coffee table,"This book is excellent! It has a lot of great pictures of our city and the ""now"" photos tried to keep the same angles and perspectives. I love this book!"
2,Skip it......,"The Mackenzie/Blackthorn contemporary series is my favorite collection of books in Elizabeth Lowell's backlist. I have reread them all several times, and each of them (Fire and Rain, Outlaw, Granite Man, and Warrior) remain some of my favorite series romances ever.With that being said, I felt compelled to read Reckless Love as it tells the story of Ty Mackenzie...an earlier generation Mackenzie.This is just not a great book. Ty thinks that Janna is a boy for the entire first portion of the book. He has all these shallow notions of what beauty is, and I found myself not really liking him at all. Janna was a better character for me, but I was hoping that my interest in her character would be enough to propel me through the long pages describing horses, mustang's, breeding..blah blah blah. For the horse lover...this may be the book for you. For me, I want a love story and this one fell short of that."
2,"Very dated, and not a hero to fall in love with","This book was originally written in 1990, and boy does it feel dated. You wouldn't think a book set in the old West could date so fast, but the hero feels like the villain in today's book, the guy who made you feel bad about yourself and your body and everything you valued, that diminished you, and that the new hero would have to help you rebuild. He was just so awful to the poor heroine, and his insistence that she was no lady, barely a female, and the put downs he kept giving her, in order to 'protect her from his woman hunger' initially irritated me but them started to make me really sad at the thought that she would going to end up with him for the rest of her life. That he apologizes in the last 5 pages scarcely makes up for it. I liked the 'Only' series, but this book was just awful for me."
5,Enjoys Laurel Merlington's warm and professional reading,"Elizabeth George's RECKLESS LOVE enjoys Laurel Merlington's warm and professional reading as it tells of one Janna, who has braved the wild west and faces the warriors of El Cascabel along with a wild stallion and a stranger who may steal all their heart."
1,Could not even finish it,"Other books by Lowell are wonderful, but this was not. I could not even finish it. Sorry."
1,Rip-off,"So Michelle Branch is trying to be hateful in this song? Well, I don't buy it. She obviously isn't hateful, so why is she even trying? Can you say ""poser""? Anyway, in this song, she rips off Linkin Park's song ""One Step Closer"" (listen near the end where she says, ""I'm about to break""). Linkin Park rip-off, I see. She even ripped off No Doubt's similarly titled song ""Happy Now?"" (see title and first line in chorus, except in the title, she adds ""Are you"" to make it her own). I'd rather listen to Linkin Park's and No Doubt's originals instead of this blatant rip-off."
2,Not worth the price!,"This DVD was nearly [..] It was cute, but not fantastic. It covered about 1/4 or less of what I would have expected for something about 1/2 the price. The description didn't say that it is for college level algebra, so I purchased it. It wasn't until we watched it that it noted that it was for college level algebra. My 6th grader understood it fine, so I wouldn't get it if you need something for college level. Just cutsy ... not worth the price. I bought another topic at the same time, hopefully that one will have more information in it."
2,"Natrol Sleep N Restore Tablets, 20-Count","Natrol Sleep N Restore Tablets, 20-Count. I was expecting a relax sleep , dreamless, and woke up like I just slept...but nothing happen...."
1,Doesn't work and pills literally SMELL HORRIBLE!!!!!,"These didn't help my sleep at all; and they made my entire room smell awful! This herbal remedy reminds me of the nasty smell that belonged to the food my brother fed to his crickets (the crickets were for his tarantula). The odor permeates everywhere and made my other medicines smell bad too, my hands even smell after touching it! I would NEVER recommend this in a MILLION years!"
1,I HAD A BAD REACTION!!,"Holy smoke! I am a very healthy 36 year woman, took a HALF a pill at 11PM, was woken up by my son at 7AM and I could not stand up! The room was spinning horribly, I threw up and was lying on the bathroom floor waiting for my doctor to call me back. A headache and continued dizziness continued for about 36 hours. FROM HALF A PILL! Buyer beware."
4,Fun read!,"William Breuer has collected a great collection of short stories that provides a great introduction to many lesser-known aspects of WWII, especially radar and Ultra intercepts used by Great Britain. This book, along with others in the series, is an easy, informative read while also containing a wealth of little-known facts and true short stories."
4,Good fun!,"This toy is a fun thing to mess around with when your are bored. It's worth Getting if you are planning on getting more than one set. This is a great toy, and it is a neat idea!"
4,"Nice, solid, good sound, but not very modern","I've owned the receiver for years and have enjoyed its sound, power, and function. It has been moved into my bedroom to run sound for my cablebox, tv, and iPod. It works for this purpose just fine. It is not, however, up to date with technology. One would most likely desire a more full set of HDMI switches, app-driven controls, and network interactions. The prices I've seen on this unit (between 150-200) make it a decent price for a garage, bedroom, or workshop. For a little less than twice the price, one can get a phenomenal multi-media control for their main living area or home theater."
5,FANTASTIC!!,This is by far the BEST receiver I have ever owned and used. I have had zero problems with it. The sound is impeccable. It has so many digital optical and coax connections that I am not able to utilize its power. My dvd player is connected via digital optical cable and the sound is phenomenal.
1,FAKE!!,"THIS IS NOT LEATHER!! Looks nice, but 1) NOT LEATHER- FAKE PLASTIC LEATHER and 2) carry on size does not meet carry on size requirements- too big."
3,"Decent overview, lacking in depth","This book is a pretty good overview of the topic of clean energy, but lacking in much depth. For the price I was hoping for more thorough analysis on the topics of generation and distribution, even details on the carbon intensity of the various technologies but no such information is provided."
1,Croscell Spa Leaf Fingertip towel,Not very good material - wouldn't buy it. White is also not a great color for use with people wiping their hands.
5,Satyricon,"This is an absolutely incredible album, one of my favorites by this artist. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of old-style Norwegian black metal."
4,Good book which should feature all radicals...not just a few,"So basically what you get in this book is a second edition in a series of what should be one book. If the authors had places all of the radicals into a single book, it'd be much better. That said, the book does a good job with its animations, although you might be better off using this in tandom with an online program such as Clavis Sinica ... to break down radicals within characters and then better understand them."
1,not recommended,"purchased this item from amazon, took out of package and before even using it but touched to feel the tension on the wires and the wires broke. Got a replacement from kitchenaid (very good service) used it once for eggs, went to wipe with a damp cloth and the wire broke again. would not recommend purchasing this item."
1,Slice not,I purchased this item in December 2005 but didn't use it until July 2006. The wires broke on my first use. I thought about requesting a replacement from KitchenAid but have decided instead to ask for a refund. This item is a total waste of time and money.
2,Works great for a couple of months,"Got this to replace a cheaper egg slicer that I had broken handily (slicing mushrooms mostly) in under a month. This one felt a lot sturdier and did the job great... for a little over 2 months. Unfortunately the wires break in a way I can't really fix, so I'm trying something even more heavy duty next time."
1,Poorly constructed,I'm a bit of a Kitchenaid geek as I have quite a few pieces. This is one of the poor performers. Quite simply the wires are not secured well enough to the frame and they break shortly after purchase.If you slice nothing but hard boiled eggs this may work great for you but do not use it on mushrooms. The second mushroom was the last thing cut with this device. If you plan to slice nothing but eggs then I'd rate this at three stars.
4,Good Video,"This video is well made on the content side. It is, however, poorly made on the video quality side. The work area seems to be a room in a factory. During the video one can hear the banging of machinery running. At times one can hear workers talking in the background. The backdrop of the movie is a piece of cloth that seems as though it could fall at any time.Now for the gun content. The video is very informative. I enjoyed the person that continously asked questions off the screen. Many were the exact questions that I had. The knowledge if the person actually doing the work was exceptional. He took the time to point out the parts that were being discussed, usually with a punch as a pointer.Overall, I would buy it again, and would recomend it."
4,excellent!,"It's 4 because I rarely give anything a 5 star.No complaints though. I've had this for a while, but just used it to put my lower receiver together.To use a cliche'... it would be a bargain at twice the price.His instructions are clear, the video is good; focused and steady. I didn't have all the tools I needed, but thanks to his instruction, I realized how careful I needed to be on a couple of items when I WASN'T using the right tools.My lower receiver is ready. I'm now waiting for my upper. We'll see how that goes.Final analysis... worth every dime. If you want to put together your own ar15, buy it."
4,"Enjoyable read, especially for a Vineyard fan.","I couldn't wait to get my hands on a mystery book based on Martha's Vineyard that wasn't by Phillip Craig (good reading, but enough is enough...). This book is a nice change from J.W. (the hero in Craig's books)and the writing more complex, but I would still classify this story as a light summer read. The book begins with a mysterious scream, heard, apparently, only by our heroine Victoria Trumbull. More coincidences occur in Victoria Trumbull's presence, which was abit unrealistic, although not uncommon to real life in a small community. I enjoyed Cynthia Riggs descriptions of the island and characterizations of the people (although I quickly became annoyed at Harbormaster Domingo's abundant use of the word ""Sweetheart""!) If you are a fan of the Vineyard, Philip Craig, or light mysteries, you may enjoy this book"
3,It's ok.,"Since I don't live on Martha's Vineyard and have never been there, the details of the island were rather lost on me. I also found the way the author skipped from one character scene to another a little disorienting. I would have enjoyed knowing more back story about the characters themselves and less about the island. An ok plot but nothing all that innovative or spectacular. A first book effort, we'll hope the series improves in the depth of its characters."
2,Good idea - needs better execution...,"I love cozy mysteries, so I picked this one up at the library. I kept hoping it would improve as it went on, but it really didn't. There was not one appealing character in this story. The harbormaster is rude to his assistant constantly, the annoying assistant puts up with it, the 92 year old sleuth really does nothing to ""solve"" the case per se - plus she adores the harbormaster even though he treats her own granddaughter so badly. As well, there were a lot of ""local"" male characters who were bawdy and...just plain icky. Also, the murders in this book were almost too gruesome for a light-hearted mystery. All in all, I was really disappointed."
4,Scream in the Night,"DEADLY NIGHTSHADE by Cynthia Riggs introduces cozy mystery fans to the delightful Mrs. Victoria Trumbull.Victoria is a 92-year-old who may move with slow determined steps to alleviate a sore toe, but her years have given her an astute knowledge of the island world of Martha'a Vineyard and a determined thirst for justice. Victoria is a sleuth who will win a devoted following for her spirit, abiding interest is her world that each morning becomes new again, and the fun characters who make their home around her. No one, not even a killer will take Victoria Turnbull lightly.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
2,A Disappointment,"While I like Philip Craig's books, I was initially excited to read a mystery set in Martha's Vineyard, my favorite vacation destination, by a different author. However, after reading about 1/3 of the story, I found nothing about it that really grabs me, save for a sensationalized murder at the center of the plot. None of the characters are particularly appealing and I miss the little touches of humor and local commentary that are featured in Craig's Vineyard mysteries."
3,Disappointing,I agree with a previous reviewer. A better book could have been written for Daniel Pearl. This one is merely a poorly edited series of magazine articles.
3,"Insights from ""I Am Jewish""","This book is an extensive collection of thoughts about what being Jewish means to Jews around the world. The contributors represent a diverse group of people; from famous to infamous to unknown. Some are religious scholars; others are secular atheists. The book is divided into sections: [Part I: Identity] [Part II: Heritage] [Part III: Covenant, Chosenness, and Faith] [Part IV: Humanity and Ethnicity] & [Part V: Tikkun Olam and Justice]. Most of my favorite contributions were from Part III.Here's a few that stood out to me: [...]"
2,"A good read, but limited perspective","The book has wonderful reflections on the life of Daniel Pearl, brutally assissinated by terrorists in Karachi (Pakistan). Daniel Pearl was of course the Wall Street Journalist. But it is a book only for Jews.As a proud Jew myself, I think this book limits the scope of Daniel Pearl and its killing, and put in a narrow Jewish perspective. So I agree with the Montreal reader, and disagree with the ""oversimplistic"" teenage reader from Washington DC (soulseeker). I think all the world felt affection for Daniel Pearl, and books such as this tend to undermine this global affection. His message of greater understanding stands in contradiction with this book.As the teenage reader from DC underscores, it is a book that will unfortunately attract only Jews, further undermining the memory of Daniel Pearl."
4,What a Nice Book!,"The premise of this book is exquisite. It is not only eye opening, but filled with valuable information and a lesson in Jewish Pride. I love it!"
2,FAIR,The Program tabs didn't really work for my dog. I used them along with Hartz product for between the shoulders. The dog was still infested with fleas until I used a better flea ointment (advantage).
2,ok,"product didn't work well on my dog. I used it with capstar to get rid of the adult fleas fast. It did cut down on the amount she had, but she still had too many fleas to be around my kids."
3,Program Flea Tabs for Cats are just OK,"I purchased these along with Capstar, which I had used before. The Capstar works, Program I wonder about. After one month and treatment of the house, there was no significant decrease in fleas. The enclosed info states it takes 3 weeks before there is any sign of a decrease in the little visitors. I have just given my two cats their second dose and hope that this helps. It is an expensive product if it does not work."
1,Horrible Product,I used this for 2 small dogs and they both had fleas again within a week of using the product.
1,Piece of junk,"First one I bought was missing hardware. I returned it for a new one and had it assembled in 15 minutes: ready to go! The trouble came when the spreader kept dumping too much fertilizer. I went through 10 pounds of fertilizer on 500 square feet of lawn. 10 pounds should have done 2500 square feet. I had it set to zero so nothing should be coming out and it still kept dumping way too much. I discovered that the fertilizer pellets kept getting stuck and keeping the metering gate from closing. I had to stop several times to try to clean out the fertilizer so the gate would close, but it would just happen all over again. It is a bad design flaw, as the metering gate is too flimsy. I could have fixed the problem by bolting a sold bar of metal to the side to make it rigid, but why should I have to do that after paying full price for it? I took it back and got my money out of it. Cheap, cheap, cheap!"
1,Piece of CRAP,"Ordered this piece of junk in May this year, after receiving it a part was missing...I called this company's customer service from May to request part 4 times...I finally received part on JUNE 8th! Guess what IT didn't fit correctly was too late to return it so I took a $[...] dollar loss....don't be stupid, don't order this as I had to throw it out!Had to give it one star so that I could write this review!"
3,Looks good but??????????,When I got it and the handle was sticking out of the box . It wasn't the easiest to put together because the instructions didn't show how the cable was to be put to the control to drop seeds or other products . It took me two nights but finally I think it is on right .Who knows though . I think the cable will bust the plastic after a while . I have not spread anything with it yet . It seems to roll nice and is big enough for alot of product . Most reviews of these kind of products have not been good but if the cable stays on I think it will work well .
4,Works fine.....if you read directions,"Others complain about the ""flimsy"" nature of the control bar for the flow regulator -- I am wondering what exactly they are trying to spread, pebbles? Also there are complaints of the ""inaccuracy"" of the metering knob -- the metering knob is a general set of numbers from 0 through 12 or something, only meant as a relative gauge. You should calibrate any spreader you buy, no matter the manufacturer. None are accurate.My review statement is: calibrate it (as you should be doing anyhow) and don't spread pebbles, this spreader will work just fine for you.BTW, the directions which come with the device clearly state both of these facts as well...."
5,good spreader,"I previously owned a Scotts Spreader. This spreader is better built and with few metal parts seems unlikely to corrode. I don't understand the negative reviews. It was easy to put together, the gate worked effectively and the agitator cycled well. The measuring gear worked well enough. You always have to gauge yourself how much it spreads. The plastic well seems thick enough and unlikely to break. I'm using it to spread fertilizer and seed and it seems to be working very well. Its low price makes it seem like an excellent value"
1,Sorry that i bought it,"when i looked at the spreader online the discription was inviting but when it arrived is when the dissapointment started , When i attempted to assemble it the hardware package was the wrong one so i had to wait another week and a half for a new hardware package to arrive . Then after assembly i used it and it is very flimsy , The wheels don't turn all of the time and the adjustment for the fertilizer is not very accurate . I should have just bought a Scott Spreader and been happy . P.S. I probably will . Ron P. Texas"
2,I/2/ HOUR USE,AFTER 1/2 HOUR OF USE THE DROP CONTROL POPPED OUT AND COULD NOT BE REPLACE TO WORK PROPERLY. REALLY BAD ENGENEERING. A BENT WIRE IN A PLASTIC HOLDER. CALED THEM AND THEY SAID THEY WILL SEND A NEW CONTROL. WE'LL SEE IF THE NEW ONE IS AN IMPROVEMENT.
2,Steamy...but that's about it,"This book had many great love scenes. They weren't very in tune with the rest of the story, and most of them happened because the heroine was 'in her burning moon', but anyway... I quite liked the love part of the story, but the rest - all the werewolf stuff - was simply not very interesting. I kept skipping pages. At least it was easy to spot the 'romance' parts :) The book is not too bad, bu it has nothing to stand out from the crowd of similar books."
4,Most excellent reads,Another charming and wonderful chapter in the MegaverseI loved it and I can't wait for moreAngela Knight rocks
1,Too delicate for regular use,"I actually bought one of these in the store and was browsing Amazon for a replacement. The fact that most of the ones in the store display were broken should have been a tipoff. The wires that do the slicing were all broken. These were all the had, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It didn't even make it home. Several of the wires came unattached from the ends. I'm hoping maybe they just had a bad batch. Though I usually like KitchenAid products, I certainly wouldn't recommend this item to anyone."
2,Kitchen Aid Egg Slicer Fails,"The first time using the product, two of the stainless steel wires broke! I am still able to use part of the slicer, but it is not effective."
1,What a rip-off!,"This was a horrible egg slicer. I thought something from KitchenAid that was advertised to slice strawberries or mushrooms would be worthwhile, but was I wrong. Worked fine for eggs, but broke on the first strawberry. My previous one broke on the first mushroom!Don't bother. Use a knife. Save the slicer for the eggs."
2,SKIP this one if you are specifically interested in Northern Idaho,"Don't purchase this book for Northern Idaho.Although ""North Idaho"" is listed in the table of contents, description of these routes are VERY minimal. In fact, the opening to the chapter ""North Idaho Paddling Trips"" they reference the book ""Paddle Routes of the Inland Northwest"" by Landers and Hansen. This book ""Guide to Idaho"" even states ""If you're planning on doing some northern paddling, you'll want to have their book""Don't purchase this for northern idaho."
4,A blend of the new and the old...,"In their latest album, In Flames has managed to somewhat successfully blend their sound from pre-""Reroute to Remain"" albums with good aspects of their newer material. The lyrics are much better than their last two albums, although I have to say they have lost some of their edge from earlier albums. Their last album was not even Death Metal, and was mediocre at best. Although they cannot be compared to their rivals in Swedish Metal, most starkly Dark Tranquillity, they have managed to find 'clarity' in their sound again. For this, I do commend them. If you love Death Metal and heavy music in general, this should be midway down you list of things to buy."
4,Getting Back On Track,"""Come Clarity"", the latest album by the highly influential Gothenburg melodic metal act In Flames, is a strong album that mixes both their modern and older sound very nice. It's a good recovery album after the mediocrity of ""Soundtrack To Your Escape"", which only had a few highlights and nothing more.""Take This Life"", the first single of this album, shows promise. With staccato riffage in the beginning and a more dynamic sound, it got me looking into this album. Other tracks such as ""Leeches"" and ""Crawl Through Knives"" show off more spectacular work from this band. ""Come Clarity"" was a surpise for me, though, as it was more of a ballad. The only thing that the band could improve on more is the clean singing. However, if you're not a vocalist purist, you may be able to get by it.Overall, this album gets a 4. The band has not lost hope, but this disc doesn't have the band going back to the ""Lunar Strain"" and ""The Jester Race"" anytime soon. Recommended for something original."
5,*****RIP YOUR HEART OUT SICK!!!*****,"This is a fast paced super sick cd. All the tracks are fierce and unrelenting. Again this band has made a perfect Album. In my opinion is the best since Clayman!!!Take This Life, Vacuum, and Crawl Through Knives!!!!SICK SICK SICK!!!!!!GET THIS CD!!!!!!!10/10 FIVE STARS*****"
2,"you enjoy, if you know listen to","if one think that ive listened all of the in flames albums, it can be easily supposed that im a good listener of this band. its now more than 1 month since i got this album, it hasnt grown on me yet. further, its like just a noisy thing. of course there are some tracks out of this comment though, if id known this is such a kinda thing, to say honestly, i wudnt have got it. to me this thing doesnt deserve to be purchased. all above, if you manage to listen it in the right way trying to absorb the insanity which is being tried to show in, maybe you can enjoy. but i dont think thats what my intention is while listening to music. insanity might be a excellent spice in music, especially in such a style of music, but it cant be the main reason for listening anyway."
2,Too predictable,"The obvious goal of this recording was to reinvigorate the bands base by claiming that it was a sort of ""return to form."" In reality this album is most obviously in the basic template of the last couple that have caused the older fans to mostly move on. They attempt (very badly) to make it more aggressive but it still feels mostly catered towards the the new fans they picked up on their last couple. If your an old fan you might find a couple songs on here you like and if that's good enough for you then go ahead and get it."
3,Okay,"So on In flames new album it is not close as good as CLayman WHorcle or colony, jester race but is better than their last two albums it is good but the Cd is not as a whole great it suffers from a few bad songs but i think if you are new to in flames or a fan you might want to buy it but dont expect another Whoracle its is okay"
