5,Validation in Numbers,"Peter Gillquist charts the journey that so many of us have been on. What makes their story particularly amazing is that they didn't start from Orthodoxy. In complete ignorance, these Campus Crusaders began to study and to search. When they discovered Orthodoxy, in typical Protestant fashion they set up their own Evangelical Orthodox Church. The remainder of the book chronicles their journey through theological and ecclesial waters, their attempts to overcome protestant proclivities against certain practices and their search for union with an Orthodox fellowship. What makes their story amazing is that they started from *nothing* but church history and the Bible. This journey is reflected in my own. I intend to buy copies for my family who cannot understand how I could become Orthodox. I expect it would be helpful for Protestants who have visceral reactions against any suggestion that one particular church might actually come close to embodying the ""New Testament Church."""
5,Leavemealone gives false info,"Hithe nagative review by leavemealone is totally off Base.....apparently this person has never read the Didache written by first Century christians describing Christian worship.....as far as mass miracles go he's obviously never belonged to a church that had a weeping icon of the Theotokos or smelled Myrrh coming from the icon itself happening as soon as a beloved priest died...well i have......also Jesus did not set up his church to be a spiritual buffett...pick and choose your beliefs........as far as the Roman Catholic question he needs to start reading christian history.........He also obviously has no idea what Holy Communion is all about..........Orthodoxy is not head knowledge , it's a living, breathing extension of God...."
5,Excellent book!,"I NEEDED AN EXPLANATORY BOOK TO INTRODUCE ME TO THE ORTHODOX FAITH AND THIS BOOK EVEN TAUGHT ME THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MY OWN RELIGION! EASY TO READ, ENTERTAINING AND HEARTFELT. VERY THOROUGH FACTUALY. I SUGGEST IT 100% TO ALL WHO ARE CONVERTING OR EVEN JUST NEEDING MORE INFO ON THE ORTHODOX CHURCH."
2,an american conversion,"as these reviews should try to help u make a decision regarding a purchase i will say this. this book is about a group of evangelicals who attempt NOT to join orthodoxy directly but, to have their INVENTED church brought into the orthodox family of churches. after their studies they did not go for chrismation at the local church; they wanted their own still. if you read this book carefully you will see that this is a wonderful and unwitting comment on american religious conversion. their church is called the EVANGELICAL orthodox church, take note. is it any wonder they were received with hostility in constantinople? by the way, i like the orthodox faith so i wouldn't wish any of our evangelicals on them. this is a mixed development. already you have people droning on about homosexuality et al. as usual, an interest in early christianity sparks a conversion."
3,As Interesting as it is Unconvincing,"This book brims with the excitement typical of converts to a faith, and the author deftly weaves together both the history of a mass conversion of American evangelicals to Orthodoxy and a doctrinal apologetic for their newfound beliefs. As an explanation to outsiders as to HOW this happened, this book is top-notch. For me, it failed to convince that this is the right path. The apologetics rang very similar to very tired and long-answered defenses of Roman Catholic teachings and practices, although a bit more open-ended and inconclusive. I was especially astonished that the writer brought up the topic of how the terms for bishop and presbyter may have been used interchangeably in Scripture, without even providing an explanation as to why or explaining why church father Clement of Rome used the terms for the same position.Again, if you are looking for an explanation for why some evangelicals and others are turning to Orthodoxy, this book is a good place to start."
2,Better have good eyes for the Pulsar PBK013,"LCD has symbols (am/pm and alarm on/off) that are too small to read. The ""light"" to read time at night is a joke. Back to a cheaper and more functional Timex indiglo for me. The fact it arrived with a near dead battery and issues didn't help."
4,Soulful reggae,"Roy Cousins' Royals sweet soulful reggae will appeal those that enjoy the Heptones or Mighty Diamonds. Mostly a 'conscious' roots vibe. In addition, there is some great backing musicianship."
2,A bit slow,Having reading a few Zane Grey stories I have come to expect the slow and obvious plots. still good for a light read though
3,"NOT ONE OF HIS BETTER WORKS, BUT READABLE.","I have read 30 Zane Grey books to date, this one is nothing special. Many much better. 3 3 3"
4,Convincing Bach Violin Performance,"Stern is certainly to be revered as great violin virtuoso, whether on this recording or not is question.My humble listening tells me that the first two offerings, A minor and E major Violin Concertos are a bit lackluster and scratchy, and as another review points out, even at bits sound a bit off.However, for me the final two are magnificent. The final two movements of the Double Violin Concerto are superb, with Perlman and Mehta ringing in with gusto and passion. Gomberg as well does his part in making the oboe and violin concerto a triumph, with lilting, rich phrasing and clear tonality. Truly is a great soloist, and the third movement is outstanding!"
3,Isaac Stern - A Life in Music - Bach: Violin concertos,"These recordings are OK. In the first two recordings, I found Stern scratchy and off-key (probably because they were bothe done the same day), however I found the second two refreshing and well-performed! In the Double Concerto, Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman give a well-done recording with beautiful effects! It all begins with a fast, 3-minute violin piece, then it goes into the beautiful middle movement of the piece (in Largo ma non Tanto)---this is probably the most beautiful piece ever written (or performed)--- it all ends with another 3-minute violin piece which is also well-done! The violin-oboe concerto in C-major (which is conducted by Leonard Bernstein) is extrememly well-performed and clear, however it does not posses the virtuoso that the other three do. I suggest this one with, Bach: Violin concertos with Pinchas Zukerman and Jose-Luis Garcia!"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"DOING THIS REVIEW IS MORE INTERESTING AND A BETTER WASTE OF TIME , I'VE SEEN SOME CRAP FILMS BUT MANAGED TO WATCH THEM TO THE END, THIS ONE I DIDN'T GIVE A CHANCE IT WAS AWFUL 20 MINS WAS ALL I SAW , WATCH AT YOUR OWN PERIL IF YOU WANNA LOSE THE WILL TO LIVE OR DIE OF BOREDOM , OR BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT WASTING MONEY , OR ALL 3"
2,Too Much Violence -- Not enough Val Kilmer,"I finally got a chance to watch the DVD ""2:22"" and was very disappointed, first in the extreme violence I was so disgusted when the jerk hit the dog. I hate violence and even more when it is violence against a animal. Then I was shocked that Val Kilmer was on the screen for only a small part of the DVD. I am a Big Fan of Val Kilmer and bought this DVD without knowing to much about it because it seemed Val was starring in it. They should have listed Val as a cameo. I will not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,I was surpised,"I thought the plot could have alot more meat to it - this movie caught my attention because of the title - 2:22 - and i bought soley on that premise - however after viewinging it, i did not find it that interesting at all."
4,CLIP TRICK,"Just got this holster and, at first, was shocked that it appeared as bad as everyone mentioned in their online reviews. HOWEVER, there is an easy fix to the out-of-the-box tight fit:The retaining clip is actually pliable (I think it acually has a steel insert???) and can be flexed upward to decrease the tension on the phone which will allow for a substantially easier release! Being right handed, I've found phone release is best accomplished by placing my thumb on the rubber dot on the upper back left of the phone (below the antenna base) and pulling the clip release (back & upward) with my index finder in one fluid motion while keeping my middle finger over the front of the phone so it doesn't pop out. Insertion is done in reverse...all in all it's not perfect, but not as bad as the other reviews indicate."
1,POOR V60 HOLSTER DESIGN,"THE HOLSTER THAT COMES WITH THE V60 PHONE HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST AND POOREST DESIGN I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT HANGS OUT SO FAR FROM YOUR BELT THAT IT GETS CAUGHT ON EVERTHING FROM DOOR FRAMES AT THE OFFICE AND AT HOME,TO BOOTHS AT RESTAURANTS WHEN YOU GET UP,AND THE SEAT BELT IN YOUR CAR.. NOW WHEN IT RINGS IT TAKES TWO HANDS TO GET IT OUT OF THE HOLSTER AND IF YOUR DRIVING!!!! WELL DO I NEED TO SAY ANYMORE... ""O"" THEN TRY PUTTING IT BACK IN,YOU HAVE TO HIT THESE LITTLE NUBS IN THE SLOTS,AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT JUST RIGHT IT WILL TRY TO TAKE THE BACK COVER OFF. I COULD GO ON BUT I THINK YOU GET THE POINT. COME ON MOTOROLA YOU CAN DO BETTER THEN THIS. THINK HOW GOOD THE STARTAC HOLSTER WAS.."
5,See Clip Trick above...very easy,"I struggled when I first had this because it did not come with instructions on how to insert and dissengage the phone, but once I figured it out, it's the simplest holster I've ever had...and also the safest. The phone has never popped out on its own and is easy to get in and out. Just put your thumb at the back base of the antenna and push the clip up and away from the telephone while pushing the phone out with your thumb in a twisting motion. The drawback is that it does not come with instructions. A elegantly simple piece of engineering.Mine broke when my grandaughter fell on it but I'm getting another one."
2,At least these stay on,"Unlike belt clips for prior models that would constantly send the phone falling into things, this one does hold it securely. Almost too securely in fact. It also puts the phone at what I feel to be an ackward angle from the body. Getting better but not quite there yet."
2,Minimalistic,Basic and adequate to carry your V60 around. Cumbersome to remove phone from clip and does not offer any external protection. Save your money and opt for the Body Glove neoprene case with belt clip !!
2,Serviceable but needs work,"I really appreciate the reviews others took the time to write.I absolutely love the Motorola V60, (even though I agree that the Menu System and documentation are not nearly as easy or intuitive as with a Nokia.)The Belt Clip Holster is cumbersome. It required my engineering hat, (something I have had to learn how to wear... not a natural talent,) to figure out. Even so I feared it would release the phone, so I was glad to read of others confidence based on their StarTac experience.I can appreciate that it is difficult to ergonomically design a carrying device for a flip phone. The current clip holder works, it is just too bulky and requires a lot of practice to smoothly release the phone from the clips. Still, I have to believe that some sort of holster or pouch is possible that is far more attractive and practical than what is currently offered.I hope the design team at Motorola is working on it."
2,"Bulky, hard to use.","It's difficult to remove the phone from the holster, and it looks like I'm ""packin' heat"" when worn under my business suit jacket.Slimmer profile and easier release mechanism would be appreciated in future products.Love my V60, though!"
2,Bad,"I just got the v60i and really love the phone. The belt clip is another story. To get the phone in takes some doing, at least to get it in right! The two notches that you have to line up with are a real pain and can't be done quickly or with any way to know if ""it's in"" unless you look. And the ""death grip"" it has on the phone is amazing!The whole process of getting the phone out of the holster is horrible. When you finally do get the clip to let go it almost always ""snags"" on the battery compartment button. I'm afraid it's going to rip it off!! It does make you wonder how they test these things!I just purchased an extended battery with the bigger door. After reading around I'm very worried that it won't hold the phone with the extended battery. But luckily, I've found the answer to that it's part # OEM Carry Pouch with Clip - SYN8848."
2,Good UNTIL...,"I really enjoyed this holster for the reassons that it did the job and came with the phone (read free). However its usless now. You see after five months of general use it broke. In hindsight I can see why it ""fell apart"" and predict that others will/have experence(d) the same. Untill then enjoy!"
3,"Looks great, not as much fun as expected.",Looks and works great. Not as much fun as expected. The plastic corn poppers are more appealing to my kids because they make noise. This one just spins. Every kid is different.
3,Una colonna sonora di transizione,"Una colonna sonora di ottima fattura (stiamo parlando di James Horner) che, tutto sommato, sottolinea adeguatamente le scene e le tensioni del film. Lo stile compositivo è già quello dell'Horner maturo, ma nell'insieme l'opera si presenta senza un tema dominante (e orecchiabile, per capirci) sul quale costruire le variazioni di rito, per cui dopo reiterati ed attenti ascolti resta impresso il ""suono"" sempre originale di Horner, ma nessun motivo in particolare.Troppi i richiami ai lavori precedenti, palesi stralci dello score di ""Il nome della rosa"" inseriti in almeno due movimenti.Da acquistare per un collezionista accanito che vuole l'integrale di Horner, altrimenti se ne può fare tranquillamente a meno."
4,Oh Val-,This is a classic movie for anyone who likes the corny F.B.I. jokes or others about native americans. Actually a pretty good detective type story.This was Val's tribute to his native american heritage.
5,Thunderheart,"This James Horner Soundtrack is very unusual but yet it has the earmark of Horner's creativity in putting emotion behind the movie. I bought the Thunderheart CD six years ago and I noticed that it has increased in value over the years. It has become a collectors item. It has some of Braveheart in its basic melody but holds a mystic, spiritual air to it! Being part Arapaho Indian I can feel the emotion of the moment espesially the last track. I have been to the Badlands, talked to many of my ""brothers"" and not once did any express negativity about the movie. It is a moving, emotional experience to listen to this CD in the quiet of the evening here in my home in northern Arizona and realize that I am among my ancestors; in this case, the Tonto Apache, White Mountain, Hopi to name a few. Horner created in my opinion, a masterpiece in expressing the Native American in song and music!!!!"
5,Great modern day Native American movie,"This movie is another I love so much I have watched many times. It is in modern times and based on a true incident that occured in our life time.The end has a big surprize. The whole story is based on a crime investigation by an FBI agent who was raised white but has a strong native heritage. The movie focuses on the crime investigation as well as the awakening spirituality of the Native Culture in Val Kilmer as the investigation progresses on the Reservation. Great story line, plenty of action and surprizes."
5,Blu Ray?,"Why on earth isn't this movie on Blu Ray? I have found more than one classic older movie relegated to the lesser formats, while new crappy movies are released in blu ray editions. It isn't right!"
4,Thunder Heart,"I love watching this movie, because it bring to light what was done on the reservations in the 1950 to present."
5,Oh my god...,"This movie was incredible. Never had a movie made me jump up and cheer so much, and be angry at what happened at the Oglala Rez than this..thunderheart. There are scenes here in this movie that made me cry so much in anguish and get so emotional,to think, ""this is our gov't?""How can they let this happen? Self-discovery, and awesome cinematography, along with characters you can feel make this a far better movie than Dances With Wolves, and i can't believe i've said that. Val Kilmer's greatest work.A masterpiece."
4,Good plot and great action!,"In this movie, Val Kilmer stars as an arrogant, young FBI agent Ray Levoi who is assigned to investigate a recent incident on a reservation. While there, he uncovers not only a government-related cover-up, but also unveils his part-Sioux heritage. A wonderful movie which portrays one man's refusal and final acceptance of his heritage."
1,Check before you buy,I ordered the dvd from moviemars and when I received the dvd it was in UK format which was not said to me before I bought it so I did send it back with no problems and they did give me a refund but it is a real pain to have to return it and have to pay to send it back so my suggestion is that if you buy from them to REALLY make sure that it is in our format here in north america before you buy.I'm sure that my experience was probably a rarity but best to make sure before you buy from them.
5,"Land of the Free, Not Really","This movie follows some of the Native American side of recent history.An excellent companion movie is the documentary, ""Incident at Oglala""which was presented by Robert Redford.Both movies are an indictment of the Power Elite's usual two-step dance of, ""The search for the guilty and then the punishment of the innocent""."
4,A triumph for Kilmer,"There was a period in the early 1990s, beginning with ""Thunderheart"" and continuing with ""Tombstone"" when it appeared as though Val Kilmer was shooting to become the best actor in Hollywood. Don't believe it? Then check out his performance here. Kilmer carries ""Thunderheart,"" which without his subtle performance would be just another thriller, and an overly P.C. one at that. You know early on that his character is going to undergo an epiphany during the film. But watching him do it is what makes the movie so entertaining. Like with his Doc Holliday charater in ""Tombstone,"" Kilmer shows the ability to completely submerge himself in his acting. He really is that good. Sam Shepard makes a good supporting character, even if he does become a cliche toward the end. The film is also beatuifully photographed on location."
5,Enlightening,Very enlightening regarding the conditions of the indians on the reservations and what is hidden about what the people and government are still doing to take their lands away from them and kill and hurt them and their children. Anything goes for the almighty dollar!
5,Love The Movie,It is one of my favorite movies. I love it from the first time I saw it. It is when a person try to suppress who truly is and then by circumstances dicovers his heritage again. It isa wonderful movie to have.
4,Bang For Your Buck,"What can I say? The cast (especially Graham Greene) are great, and the movie keeps you watching til the last second. You'll enjoy this."
5,Great for hiding ugly cords,We have our flat screen on the wall and used this to cover the cords. It looks much better and it's really easy to use. I would definitely buy again.
4,"Easy to use, but missing pieces","Very easy to use, and does great job of hiding cords. It would have received 5 stars, but 2 small connectors were missing from package; luckily I didn't need those."
3,Blending mythologies,"We found this one highly enjoyable. (By my standards, three stars is an excellent rating; I'd like to give it three and a half.) While surely aimed to take advantage of the 1999 millenial fever, it has lost none of its flavor. Certain bits of the historical setting failed to persuade me; e.g., can wax candles, no matter how thick, really serve well for beating children? (I'd have appreciated a research footnote.) The mythological aspects, however, struck me as solid, and I much relished the blending of Norse with Christian Apocalyptic mythology, along with the sympathetic treatment of representatives of both creeds. Well-written and satisfying, as I would expect from this author under whatever pseudonym."
4,Love It.,"Great follow up to 'Forver', Earth's vocals are less aparent on this cd there is more of an electro presence. I personally think Gus Gus can do no wrong so I may have a biased opinion but everyone I put on to Gus Gus falls in love with them. They are very unique sounding, you can listen to this cd while driving, dancing, working out etc. Its solid."
1,Tower of Babel,"Of his own admission (p.341), ""It is a Tower of Babel in which multiple languages and forms of writing bump into each other or mingle with each other, constantly being transformed and engendered through their most unreconcilable otherness to each other, an otherness which is strongly affirmed, too, for plurality here is bottomless and is not lived as negativity, with any nostalgia for lost unity."" To read a text without knowing where it comes from or where it is going is Derrida's hopeless gift to philosophy and literature. If it weren't for professors of literature, he would have been buried deep in the trash heap of philosophy. As for the merits of translator Barbara Johnson, unreconcilable is not a word, even if Derrida intended it as such, just like his stupid differance, a word that isn't a word, though he said it was just to make a fortune."
3,Important book,"As important as Of Gramatology, is this book in the thought of Derrida. If you want to get into Derrida's World you should read this book."
3,This made my head spin!,"This book was cool man! It's like forget everything because nothing exists, right? I think the only other time I had this much fun was when I whooped Gabe's arse in Power Stone 2."
2,save your money,"The book is teribly outdated. Even though the copywright date is 2006 the author neglects to deal with a lot of the very current issues at hand in the photography market. A lot of the book is cut and pasted from other books he has written in the past and many of the examples he uses will simply not work in today's market. Save your money, find the websites and forums online where peoople are talking about what is and isn't working today. Honestly I felt like the author was merely trying to make some money off a another book with very little effort. cheers- jono."
3,The Practice of Dzogchen,"The first part is very boring, and massive. Written in a style that makes it very very hard to follow the meaning. But, afterwards the book becomes very clear. Definetely a great book on dzogchen once you get past the first parts."
2,Classroom lessons,"This was a required book for a class I took. I wouldn't recommend it ""just for leasure"" reading."
5,Very Useful,"I have always been drawn to books that will help me to understand what my dreams mean. To me, they are impressions, guiding from the Lord to help me in my everyday life. I was very interested to see what this book had to offer. Our author also longed to know what his dreams meant to me in his everyday life. He is in the ministry and sought the Lord to help him understand and help others in the dream quest.As it began to unravel for him he kept notes and finally came up with much information that definitely will help you to understand better what your dreams are trying to tell you.He gives meanings to symbols that I found very interesting. It is written in an easy to understand way and does give a glossary in the back of meanings of something's that will definitely help you.It isn't as in-depth as many of the newer books out now, but it still has some useful information for those of you who are studying dreams and the price is right. I enjoyed it and think you will too."
5,Awesome!,"My mom used to do this every day on VHS when I was a kid. I bought this for her for mother's day, and now she does it every day again!"
4,Thicker than I thought.,"Maybe it's just me, but I thought pantiliners are thin. These are not bad, but comparing to the Always pantiliners I'd been using, they're just thicker than I thought. They do stay in place."
5,amazing,these are great! I've been using them for years now! they stay in place :) I wish carefree would come up with the same once but black ones!
2,Mis-advertised as 3-4 season tent,"I was shocked and disappointed to find a tent that was called a 3-4 season tent had 2 large vents that had no way to zip them closed. This tent was freezing cold at night, even with the fly up, and even in temperatures in the upper 40's. What a waste of $190!"
2,TIME WARPED,"11:59 is a film with an interesting premise, but it's so poorly executed, it sabotages that premise. Unbelievable gimmicks, no explanation for the title, or how our hero manages to go back and forth in time. Add some inept performances from Raymond Anthony Bailey, Laura Fuller and Liz Cunningham and you have a reasonably inexplicable movie. nice try, though."
4,Worth Reading,This is a great book that is interesting and a great help in improving your vocabulary.
3,What are they thinking???!!!,"How can Harper be publishing Little House books without Garth Williams' illustrations?!?! I have loved these books too much to let this happen without saying anything. Please, please, please, if you like the real, complete books with the original artwork, write to Harper Trophy and tell them to put it back!"
4,It was an excallent book!,Little house in the big woods was apsaloutly great. It was so good because it was detailed and exaciting.I liked the way that is was writen. Like how they said mama and papa. I storly encourige people to read this. I realy enjoyed it.
4,Best of the series,I am an 8 year old girl who loves the Little House series of books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Why I liked it is because it's so happy and because I liked the little girls. My favourite part is when they go to a dance at Grandma's house and Laura danced with her uncle. I would recommend this book for people who like to read happy books.
5,The amazing review of The Little House in the Big Woods,I like this book because it takes you back to the 1800s.It has some funny parts when Ma slaps the bear trying to move it out of the way thinking its the horse.I also thought that when they sloudered the pig and learning how they done things was cool.If you enjoy reading books from the old days then you will enjoy reading this book.
3,"I like, I don't like","I think ""Little House in the Big Woods"" is a little boring, because there isn't any action to it compared to ""Little House on the Prairie."" I think what made the book boring was the quietness in the house, for example, the only noise they had was Pa's fiddle. Laura's mom, and her sister Mary were too ladylike. Mary liked to wear her bonnet, but Laura didn't. Laura wasn't very proper and that made Laura's mother mad. When Laura got mad at a Mary for saying that blonde curls are better than straight brown hair, and then smacked her, it made the book more interesting. Other than that I liked it when Ma thought the bear was Sukey (the cow), because it made me want to know what was going to happen next. I wanted to keep reading so I could get to the next book.. I think you should read ""Little House in the Big Woods"" to get to ""Little House on the Prairie"" because it will lead you to more interesting action."
4,LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS,"This book is about Laura and her family living in the wood in their little wood house. Laura and her big sister Mary always get to do their jobs every day such as helping their mom,but on Sunday is where they don't work ,but just stay home.Everyday Laura's father always go out to killed bear,deer,and lot of food for them to eat before winter come.Laura's dad also went to trade things at a store in the town and everytime he went Laura and Mary always happy because father always bring them present.I would like to recommed this book to kids that are 9-12 who really like to read alot."
2,Manufacturer defect,There was a manufacturer defect. The last few pages of the book are cut short. Some of the print is missing.
5,little house books from amazon,I bought this book for my granddaughter. She loved it . We read them to her mother and her aunts and uncles. It is great to share books from grneration to generation. I founnd it at a great price and received quickly. this is a great read aloud book and helps children understand what our forefathers went thru.
5,A pleasant history lesson,"My 6 year old grandson learned much about our country's era of expansion. He loved listening to the story and asked many questions about ""the old days"". We both are looking forward to the next book."
5,"a wonderful,excellent book...a classic","this is one of my favorite books - the whole series is. well-written,interesting for both boys and girls,an excellent source of American pioneer history,definately a book my children will read - a classic"
5,Outstanding look into an America that was...,"This book will not have you begging to live the lifestyle Laura Ingalls lived, but it will shame you for not having greater appreciation for all the material goods and conveniences you have instantly.Laura Ingalls, without whining or complaining of how difficult life was, has done far more to elucidate a period of American history that, nowadays, only inhabitants of poor countries can comprehend.If no other bit of this book were read than her description of making butter in Winter, we all would be more satisfied by today's luxuries - C. William Anderson, aka Travis C. Ward.Get this book and revel in Laura's charming look at her childhood but also read between those lines. Her generation was heroic. For similar types of readings I suggest also you read the Foxfire series."
2,careful,Be careful ordering used books. I am Very Disappointed in the condition of the book when I received it. I wanted to give it as a gift but..................someone took a marking pen to it and wrote on the cover and several pages on the inside.
2,Little House in the Big Woods 75th Anniversary Edition,"The book itself is wonderful. However, it did not come to me in good shape. It was a hard cover and new, but the corner of it was damaged. I didn't have time to exchange it because I needed to ship it to my neice for her birthday, but I was embarassed that I had to send something in that condition. I would have hoped that there was some kind of quality control at Amazon, but apparently not too stringent in that category."
2,I have never been so dissatisfied,"I ordered this by accident. It isn't even twenty-five pages, it's bound together with what looks like two pieces of cardboard, and I read it in fifteen minutes and understood none of it. Look this up on the internet and print it out for five cents instead of ordering it on amazon for ten dollars.Not to say Boehme isn't worth reading. Go order The Way to Christ or The Signature of All Things."
2,Great classic bouts but...,"too much commentary. The commentary by the experts is too much and unnecessary. Also, there was more talk than actual fights in the almost 5 hours of DVD. I would have preferred more visual and less audio."
1,Too Choreographed!!!,"I am a FIRM Believer. I have a number of the tapes and use the Body Sculpting System 1 religiously. I must say that I didn't like this video at all. I actually sold it after one use. The moves were too choreographed and the cueing is awful. In addition, proper form was not emphasized in a majority of the segments. If you didn't know, the video is a compilation of the best of the Firm's Body Shaping Series. So if you think that it is 1 hour of Tracie Long, WRONG!!! There are at least four different instructors and everyone is not the best teacher!! Tracie Long is the best! Her segments come from the Firm's Maximum Body Shaping tape. Save your money and purchase that!!!"
3,Whole body with a little annoyingness,"I like this video. I have both the ""firm strength"" and ""firm cardio"" that much of this video is from, so i am comfortable doing it. It's not nearly as hard as you might think of first preview. They have some harder sets, but than mix in some stuff from ""firm basics"" and some EASY cardio stuff that you feel like is a waste of time. The Jen Carmen set seems to never end either. It's right in the middle, and it's pretty bad. If that section wasn't in there, and they had better cardio sections, I'd give it a full five stars, but because of that, it'll be at three. I do this one about every two weeks."
2,Meh...,"I know I'll get hammered for even attempting to write something negative, but I have to say this. I bought this dvd on the basis of the reviews & I gotta say that as a big fan of the group, I was disappointed with this concert. The band was flat. Simple as that. I didn't even finish watching it. I understand that this reunion wasn't something that Bruce and Baker, who can't stand each other, really wanted to do (they've admitted that it was more for financial reasons than anything else) and it shows. The performances just don't have any enthusiasm. If you watch old Cream from the 60's, the intensity that they played with back then was seriously lacking."
2,tired old men,"tired old men who were never really all that ""back in the day"". Overrated in their heyday. Time hasn't been kind too any of the 3. A few (very few) of their tunes got to me back in the 60's. But even their finest moment ""Crossroads"" from Wheels of Fire, sounds lethargic, tired, and lacking impact or emotion.Take off the rose colored glasses and look again. The creme de la Cream, this is NOT."
2,Someone Give Eric Some Uppers!,"This would have been a great Cream show if Jack and Ginger had toured with a handful of great guitarists instead tired, worn out Eric Clapton. Eric's a bit of a bore -- it's obvious when he's interviewed -- but proved without doubt in his playing. If they had toured with Eddie Van Halen, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck and Robin Trower - this would have been the show it should have been. There's just enough here to get you excited, then let down everytime you focus on Eric's horrible tone and thoughtless solos. If Eric had played a different 335 and SG everynight, he could have sold each for a small fortune afterwards, and made the show sound stronger. I don't think he ever even used the bridge position on his stratocaster!"
2,Lackluster...,Like they're going through the motions. The original farewell concert had better emotion & power than this. Maybe they should have recorded the New York reunion shows instead.
2,True Cream fans beware!,"As a true Cream and British rock fan, this show is a complete disappointment. I had high expectations and was really let down. Clapton was, is, and will always be, one of my favorite musicians, but this was NOT Cream. It was more like Clapton's newer pop stuff. The 2005 show was completely watered-down, tired, and commercialized. Jack Bruce was excellent on bass, but it just did not come close the the edgy intensity of the early days. I guess I was expecting magic. I should have rented it before I purchased it. After watching this concert, I had to pop in the 1968 Farewell concert to get the horrible taste out of my mouth."
1,BEWARE - FALSE ADVERTISING,"Although the track listings on both Amazaon and the Cream 2005 site describe this CD set as being the complete show, IT IS NOT - ""Sitting on Top of the World"" has been dropped. Why - who can guess? There is plenty of room on the CDs, and there is a very good recording of the song on the DVD, but for reasons known only to themselves the record company decided to omit this number.[...]This release is a disgrace. I wish I could give it zero stars."
3,More like Milk than Cream,"Ok - it's ginger, jack and eric - the reunion you NEVER thought would happen.Heck, it's pretty much the ONLY reunion that era that could happen since all the band members are still alive (well, ELP, but anyway).well - they hit all the notes (even Jack's singing is still pretty good to great) but there's no FIRE in them.Someone said ""wow, they're playing TOGETHER for the first time"". Maybe, but there's thousands of bands that could play those notes and sound just as good, I want FIRE from these guys - I want to hear them playing like it's a competitive sport! ""Yeah, DIG THIS riff dude! In your FACE!!"" If I want laid back I'll listen to clapton play these songs. There was a reason they said ""Eric is god"" in the 60s and Jack and Ginger could keep up with him.Anyway, I'm glad I didn't shell out the THOUSANDS of dollars it would have taken to go see these guys - and I'm glad this was a present and I didn't shell out the 20$ for the CD.Oh well...."
2,Going through the motions,"Jack is obviously not well. Ginger's kit sounds like an 80's pop band and Eric should just throw away that awful sounding Strat.Ok we can't have a replica I know.Eric's choice of notes is just not as good as it used to be. He was way more adventurous back in the day.No more of the lyrical phrasing, the calm excitement and melodies under extreme pressure. All gone and replaced with just going through the motions.I hope Jack and Ginger make a buck out of it. They certainly deserve it.The music died the day Clapton picked up a Stratocaster. He never really bonded with it.Anyway it looks like a lounge band playing covers. Very polite and laidback and nothing new to say."
3,Buckle up your Recliner!,"Indeed, you can never go back. The pressure to to be THE three best at their instuments in the late 60's is gone. No more Jack Bruce manic bass lines to challenge Clapton to excel, no more innovative extended jams, no Marshall stacks, no Gibsons by Clapton...no fire, no excitement. Even Clapton's mainstream signature song with the band, Crossroads, is once again reduced to the same plodding exercise he has made it since the band's demise. Bruce and Clapton never got along too well ""back then"", which contributed to some musical tension of sorts as well. You can hear and feel that tension, that pressure to step up on the original recordings. That's all in the past. The one positive for me on this DVD is Ginger Baker, as he shows he can not only hold his own with any drummer today, but can still outdo most. I generously give this performance three stars, but a blaze of past glory is sorely missed. Just put another log on the fireplace and settle back in your favorite chair."
5,First Rate,"Thank God they did this (and I DON'T mean Eric Clapton!). Cream was captured live on audio very well in 60's but the only live video is the execrable ""Farewell Concert"" (which you can totally forget about). This video captures the band in fine form...they are as good as they were in the 60's which is astonishing when you consider the passage of years. Jack Bruce drives Eric Clapton to levels we haven't seen since 1969 and it reminds us why he was referred to as God in his heydey. Cream plays virtually every song in their catalogue (even ""Pressed Rat and Warthog""!) and, if that wasn't enough, they add a NEW Cream song to the canon, a superb ""Stormy Monday"" sung by Eric Claption. This is one of the best videos in my collection and I treasure owning it. I wish something more had come out of this one-off reunion but I'm very happy that they got this right!"
2,"Three old men, too old to rock and roll....","I cannot believe that people actually listen to the live Cream reunion CD and compare it to ANY of their live stuff from the past! There's NoFire in their instrumentation, and the vocals are weak. N.S.U.? It's a joke! Everything sounds like it's being played at half-speed. It might have been phenomenal to see them live again after 35+ years, but I don'thear it in the music. Compare Live Cream, Volume II to the 2005 versionand you'll hear the difference."
3,Not good enough;could have had done better,"Why oh why Messrs. Bruce, Baker & Clapton did not play ""Tales of Brave Ulysses"", ""I feel free"" and one of my all time Cream favourites, ""Strange Brew"".I wish Clapton could play note for solo on ""Badge"" which on the original sounds sweet and short.The DVD could at least include ( as an alternate takes) their 1993 one time peformance during their induction to R n R Hall Of Fame. I am terribly dissappointed that the producers of the DVD chhosed to include alternate takes of the same songs from different nights.I hope they duly take note of this if they intend to produce another DVD of the Cream's impending three night gigs in New York later this month.The Cream's versions of ""Stormy Monday"" and the 37 years later version of ""Born Under A Bad Sign"" is worth the price of the DVD."
4,I love it,I like when you can find these old HD-DVD videos. Any of these you can get cheap is great. Pity they no longer make them. I have a hd and bluray. HD is still an acceptable format for me.
5,If only the Beatles would have been able to reunite!,"The boys go way out of their way to recognize one another throughout this show, particularly Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce in their undisguised attempt to shower praise on bandmate, Eric Clapton, and all with great justification. These three gents defined the power trio and their ability to fill the Hall with some of the best rock and roll/blues for their brief reunion shouldn't be missed by anyone who truly loves the genre.Clapton's mastery of the electric guitar is undeniable as his seemingly effortless frolicking up and down the neck of his Strat even has his bandmates looking on with admiration.Video and sound is excellent and the overall quality of this DVD is amongst the best. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Eric Clapton, Cream and really good bluesy rock n roll."
3,"Good, But Not A Must Have","Cream is Cream however old they might be. So remember the early days or accept the fact that not many bands can do what they once did. My $0.02 is in the quality of the video recording. I cannot remember in recent memory another concert video with so many out of focus, erratic, unsteadied, what-am-I-looking-at moments included in the final edit. Shots through Ginger's high hats of Jack Bruce's nose were unremarkable and annoying. The camera often look amateurish as best. My vote is to look away often and just listen to lessen a queasy stomach."
3,WE'RE GOING WRONG,"When I heard Cream was finally reuniting I was ecstatic. I was like a kid in a candy shop when I read this cd was being released and promptly bought it on it's release date. I was pretty disappointed in it's length, yes you get 2 discs but you feel like they put could've put everything on one disc or put more songs. Overall the band sounds almost like they're going through the motions. Clapton's guitar sounds flat and uninspiring. He should have picked up a Gibson SG for these shows because a Strat just doesn't cut it. Jack's bass sounds pretty good, vocals sound aged. Ginger's vocals on Pressed Rat... sound great but his drum solo on Toad just seems lacking. Certainly not what I was expecting from the World's first supergroup."
1,Another blank,"Second attempt at ordering, also received a blank disk. Problem exists with the DVD production."
3,"Great Concert, but...","I have to deduct one star for the songs they didn't include, namely ""Strange Brew"", ""Tales of Brave Ulysees"", ""I Feel Free"", and ""Swlabr"". I would have prefered those over outtakes of the same songs that were already included, and ""Pressed Rat and Warthog"". Its okay on the original CD, as a novelty item, but it doesn't exactly JAM, does it? And while ""Stormy Monday"" is one of the greatest blues songs of all time, and this version features a great guitar solo, it's already been done to death by everyone from the Allman Brothers to Eva Cassidy.The most disapponting track, in my opinion, is ""Crossroads"". Compare this ""laid back version"" to the manic, seat of your pants '67 version. Pick up the tempo, guys.I also have to deduct one star for the dreadful cinematography. The cameras consistently go in and out of focus.Other than that, its great. I got my wish."
5,Best seat in the house,"Took a chance on this on blind faith... (pun intended). I loved the fact that while they are the same people, they are NOT the same artists they were in 1969. They tackle material that must have faded in their memory with vigor, and obviously had a good time in the process. Highlights for me were We're Going Wrong (stunning) and Stormy Monday, which has the absolute BEST performance by Clapton I've ever seen or heard. It is breathtaking, and it's CREAM. I would have purchased the DVD just for this one cut alone. Play this DVD on the best system you can find, the audio is superb, and the camera work and editing are spot-on. Buy this DVD. Period."
2,Was this a collect call or did they at least pay the charges?,"Whatever the case, they phoned this one in.Because of who they are however, this call has to be justified. Clapton, Bruce and Baker are all top-flight musicians and whatever they do, together or otherwise, isn't likely to be really bad. All three are simply too good at what they do for that to happen. Their reunion, as such, was far from bad. On a purely technical level what they played was rock solid.But it wasn't inspired. Nobody pushed anybody. Bruce and Baker laid a foundation and Clapton played off of it. Nothing more and nothing less. Bruce never made Baker play harder and neither of them gave Eric anything to really react to. Yes, they were solid. This gets two stars for that. But they were just going through the motions.Anyone looking for inspired playing shouldn't bother with this."
1,Where's the Beef?!,"This is a really bad, lackluster performance. The songs are barely recognizable without the energy that these guys exuded in their heyday. Clapton's guitar playing completely lacks enthusiasm as does the entire performance. If I'd been there, I'd have fallen asleep. Their age is no excuse for this. The Stones are just as old and exhibit more enthusiasm. Hell, B.B. King, at 80, rocks stronger than these guys! Sounds as if they'd rather have been somewhere else, and probably should have been."
1,C'mon people.,"I think the only reason this gets any good reviews is because it's new and the audio quality on the dvd transfers to our lil' home theaters so we can sit on our butts and watch these guys sit on their butts in concert.It's not completely horrible. They're all good musicians, but just a little too stiff and akward. We all know this was done just for money like most of Clapton's releases. Bruce and Baker were in need of some $$ and wanted to do this for quite a while.It's forgettable and lame. The choice of instruments for this show pretty much summed it up. When I saw photos on the internet I knew this was what it was going to sound like and feel like. I hope most of you bought it used-I'm glad I borrowed from a friend before he sold it."
3,"THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES, HOWEVER.............","THE POSITIVE FACTS FIRST, IT'S ALWAYS FUN WATCHING ERIC CLAPTON BLAZE AWAY ON THE GUITAR AND HE CERTAINLY DOES THAT ON THIS DVD. JACK AND GINGER SOUND PRETTY GOOD ALSO.NOW FOR THE NEGATIVE FACTS. FIRST, THE EDITING OF THIS DVD IS MARGIONAL AT BEST. WAY TOO MANY AUDIENCE SHOTS, FROM THE OTHER END OF THIS HUGE VENUE TO CLOSEUPS OF PLASTIC CUPS AND THE BACKS OF SPEAKERS. IT SEEMS AS IF EVERY TIME THE BAND REALLY STARTS SMOKIN', THE CAMERAS END UP SHOWING HALLWAY AUDIENCE SHOTS.SECONDLY, THE MUSIC IS VERY DATED EVEN THOUGH ITS PLAYED WELL. 35 YEARS AGO IT WAS CUTTING EDGE STUFF.NOW ITS JUST A FLASH FROM THE PAST.DID WE REALLY NEED A ""CREAM"" REUNION ? I SAW ""CREAM"" BACK IN THE DAY AND IT WAS MAGICIAL. NOW IT SEEMS AS IF THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, TRYING TO RECAPTURE A MAGICAL MOMENT IN TIME. WELL, FOR ME, SOME MAGICAL MOMENTS CANNOT BE REDONE. LET IT REST, BOYS....................."
1,Cream DVD,I received this DVD and it didn't work at all. I returned it and I am still waiting two weeks later for my refund.
1,"Oh my god, this is awful!","My friend bought this and I watched it last night with him. This is absolutely the lamest dvd ever produced. I know from Cream and not even a nostalgic notion nor even a serious flashback could lead me to appreciate this concert. If you think this is a good dvd, then I have a bridge I would like to sell you in Brooklyn. A Madison Square Garden Concert?....please...call National Security and tell them that terrorists are coming in the form of a geritol generation attack of banality. Perhaps we should raise the terror alert to orange."
2,Curdled Cream...what's the point of this?,"This comes across as a MONEY thing...a big stinky business deal. No NEW album, just play the old tunes for the ""old"" fans. Yuck! Some of the songs are of course classic, but the performances sound a little tired at times. The sound quality is solid but too clinical sounding for its own good. Like an earlier reviewer wrote: Pick up the early live albums, volume 1 and 2 instead. Now maybe I would have felt different if this was to promote a NEW studio album, but it's all just, nostalgia.My other favorite ""classic rock"" band Deep Purple, do have a NEW album, ""Rapture of the Deep"" and it truly kicks arse! New material selling close to a million copies already, ""Rapture of the Deep"" is one of the finest albums of '05. Bravo DP!What will sadden me is that the media will promote this recycled rubbish from Cream, but completely ignore the innovative and NEW Deep Purple album. Go figure. Talk about the state of the ""ART!"""
2,Where's Strange Brew?????,"I'm a Cream fan, but I have not seen any of the reunion concerts. And I don't know if I'd want to even buy this DVD. Based on the song list in the review above, it seems like my favorite Cream songs aren't even on this DVD! Strange Brew, Tales of Great Ulysees, I Feel Free, Anyone for Tennis, and Swlabr don't seem to be included on this DVD. Surely they played these songs in concert! What the hell kind of Cream concert or DVD would there be without Strange Brew?????"
4,Cream; Live at Royal Albert Hall,"One of the greatest powergroups from the 60's, 70's. Eric Clapton vocals & guitars, Jack Bruce lead singer & Bass; Ginger Baker, legendary drummer. Let's face it; Bruce & Ginger are looking pretty old. They still sound very good; but not great. I'm not a big fan of Clapton's singing. Takes you back 40 years. No new material, so don't expect a follow up. I guess they just wanted to see if they could still do it, and pad their retirement funds. (not that Claspton neede it). For many years, these guys weren't exactly friends. The distance caused a lot of animosity, and little or no communication. A better BluRay disc is Clapton & Winwood: Live from Madison Square Garden: Great performance from two ol' buddies from Blind Faith."
5,They get better & better !,"While some of the edge might have gone from their earlier years this concert series is evidence of their abilities as musicians and having left on-stage battles behind them.A must have set for any fan of Cream or Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce & Ginger Baker as individuals."
1,Cream live at albert hall came blank. The DVD was tried in 2 of my DVD players,Cream live at Royal Albert hall hall came blank. The DVD was tried in 2 of my DVD players and no success.It did not play in my neighbors' dvd player...Do I send back the Blank DVD? or what?Jim...
2,Cream-Tired Giants,"It's really sad to see these guys just going through the motions. Nothing in this DVD set or the associated CD set even comes close to the old Cream recordings from the '60's. The most glaring and obvious example of this is ""Crossroads"". Compared to the classic ""Wheels of Fire"" version, this new recording is yawn inspiring. Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce seem to have a hard time getting interested. All of the intricate interplay between guitar and bass on the earlier recording are just a memory. I guess that either Jack Bruce or Ginger Baker or both of them were running short on cash. If you want the real thing, skip this depressing effort and find a copy of ""Wheels of Fire""."
1,cream royal albert hall,very nice case all sealed up but there is nothing on the dsc.. will not play in any of my dvd players.. very upset about this purchase so i probably will never shop amazon again.. also took about 9 days to receive product
1,Warning! - HD-DVD wont play on most players,WARNING - this HD-DVD version will not paly on regular DVD players ... not even.
1,I'd prefer Spinal Tap at the R.A.H.,"If you are reading this for advice: save your money. Burn a copy off of a friend. They are obviously all still accomplished at their instruments. The fact that the three of them are still alive & can play is immense on it's own right. We know, their all great-hall of fame,etc etc. One reviewer said they are all playing ""like a band"" now, thats not what we want from Cream! We want that abusive ""crawling over each others parts"" type of playing. Take I'm so glad. On the original, by the time Clapton's solo is peaking, Bruce is playing as high on the fretboard as EC. That ""fighting"" is what made them (in my mind) what they were. Now, it's a more polite version, its almost been reduced to a shuffle-which does not work! The overall performance sounds forced. If you happen to see the DVD, it's even worse."
3,HUMMMMMMMMM...VOLVER??????,"NADA ES GRATIS EN ESTA VIDA.....SEGUN MI HUMILDE OPINION, CREAM FUE UNO DE LOS MAS GRANDES GRUPOS, CON UNA CREATIVIDAD A PRUEBA DE BALAS, ERRATICOS A VECES PERO EN DEFINITIVA UNA CONJUNCION EXACTA DE POLENTA , TALENTO E IMPROVISACION...BUENO, YA ESTA, PASARON CASI 40 AÑOS.....VOLVER? ESTA BIEN..CON TEMAS NUEVOS? QUE MUESTRAN QUE HAY UN INTENTO SERIO, ENSAYOS, UNA NUEVA PROPUESTA, NUEVA SENSIBILIDAD, NECESIDAD DE EXPRESION..O SIMPLEMENTE NEGOCIO..VOLVER A HACER LO MISMO?????..ESTA BIEN..ENTIENDO QUE MUSICALMENTE SON GENIALES, QUE ""CADA DIA CANTAN MEJOR""..QUE SE YO..YO LOS PREFIERO EN MI MEMORIA, EN SUS DISCOS, ETERNOS.. NO RECREANDO OTRA VEZ LO PASADO...ESTA BIEN, REFUGIARSE EN SUS DIAS DE GLORIA NO ESTA MAL..PERO NO ARRIESGAR NADA NUEVO? QUE ESPERAN QUE DIGAMOS? VAMOS...POR FAVOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Cream revisited,"I have this dvd and it was good to see the three of them playing together again. The only disappointment for me was Clapton seemed a bit rigid in his attitude. The song 'White Room' when it came out in the late sixties, used a wah pedal to give it a distinctive sound but for whatever reason, Clapton decided not to use it on this version much to my disappointment. As far as Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, they still seemed to have what it took to play. Bruce is showing his age however; there was a stool for him to set on occasionally.In my opinion, Clapton peaked with Cream. They were the quintessential power trio of rock. (With the exception of the Jimi Hendrix Experience)All things considered, this was a good dvd."
5,"Older, Wiser, and Still Know How to Rock","If you loved them from the albums in the 60's, always wished you had the chance to see them in all their glory. This is a timeless classic, and a chance to catch a glimpse of the past. No, it's not the same, and after all these years I would be disapointed if it was. They all bring their pasts with them, but when they get on a roll it's like nothing changed. Personally, I love 'Badge' it's short - none of the extended jams elsewhere on the disc-, but it seems all at once to be new, old, timeless, and beautiful. It is what it was, a chance for 3 guys to play music they loved, and share it with an audience. Now they reunite to share the love again, and I could not be more happy!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I saw them live, I have all the Original LP's I watched the 1968 concert on the BBC. This offering is far removed from the way I remember them. All of cream are the same age as I am, and it showed. Poor Jack was recovering from surgery and has lost is voice and stamina. Ginger was subdued but who would have expected him to still be alive. Eric, well he was just going through the motions. But the biggest criticism, as mentioned by others, was Clapton using the strat' instead of the Les Paul Gibson. They just didn't sound right. Having said this, it's Cream I bought the CD anyway."
5,JUST FANTASTIC !!,"i have been a cream fan ever since i was a young boy and have followed all three of them in their careers . i always hoped they would reform but i did not think it would happen. this is a dream come true ! i have several copys of all of their work and this is the very best. they sound fantastic, better than before. ginger is almost giving the songs a jazz feel and it really cooks. jacks singing and playing is awesome but he looks a little weak, i hope he is well . eric is just the best and keeps getting better. three masters playing at the very peak. i can not believe some of the reviews, some have not even seen it yet and are whining. some say excellent and give 3 stars. these greats are not going to be on this earth forever and lets enjoy their great talent while we can .i hope they release more of this ,its just fantastic .great job guys !!"
4,Very Impressive For Three Aging Survivors,"I was afraid I'd be disappointed if I bought this Cream collection mainly because of The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne. Instead of performing overblown arrangements of their songs with extra musicians and singers to help pad their vocals, it was just the three original members playing together. Ginger Baker didn't need another drummer to back him up while he sang his epic fairytale ""Pressed Rat and Warthog"". They don't frantically compete with each other like they used to, but the sound is full and their playing complements each other. This is the way I always wanted to hear Jack Bruce's bass. I don't miss the electric fart bass sound that Mel Schacher of Grand Funk emulated. I haven't heard Clapton play with this much spirit in a long time and you harldy miss the sound of his Gibson SG and Marshall Stack."
4,Solid Four Stars,"People who give this dvd either 5 stars or 1 star are going overboard. Cream's performance is solidly professional but definitely at a slower speed than in their glory days. Also, some of the camera shots (Clapton's back comes to mind) are questionable.Clapton still plays very well and Baker is more than adequate. Jack Bruce, however, looked like a man who was physically pressed to his absolute limit. Bruce didn't smile for a total of 10 seconds during the entire dvd but, like the pro he is, made it to the end. So, I would say that Clapton and Baker could both have played more energetically and at faster tempos, but Bruce could not have kept up.If you're not expecting more than the guys can deliver, you will find this to be a very entertaining concert video."
3,Cream reunion concert too polished.,I know you cannot turn the clock back and these guys are getting on a bit but I prefer the DVD of their farewell concert. Just compare Erics playing White Room on this DVd with his playing of it on the farewell DVD! I think the big mistake that Eric makes on this reunion DVD is that he should have used Marshall stacks and his Gibson guitars..........the Strat is a good guitar but if you want to sound like Cream you have to use the heavier sound of the Gibson also where is the wah?? The recording is too slick like Erics Me and Mr Johnson CD.....boring and with no Thunder or energy. I am sorry to have to write this having been a Clapton fan all my life but feel he is going the same way as Rod Stewart.........boring old farts!
4,Fantastic reunion,I can't believe the talent of this band still. The energy and voices from these guys is just like it used to be. What a blast from the past.
5,The Original Power Group of the Century,"Being an Eric Clapton fan for years and growing up with this group what can one not say.Jack Bruce,Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton will always be remembered by myself as one of my favorite rock bands.A must have DVD.Simly awesome!!!!"
3,Watch out for the pedestrians,"I am sorry to say I can't agree with all the glowing reviews. My title gives you an idea of my view of the playing especially Ginger. It does remind us that it really was Jack who was the driving force almost 40 years ago ( God I remember bringing home Fresh Cream and playing it to death then finding out that Spoonful which for some reason didn't make the US lp was out as a 2 sided single). This will probably bring the hate mail but if you want to get a taste of the energy of young Cream buy Farewell Concert for all its flaws the update still shows the real deal. One more thing where's the menu did I get a bad one? Neither disc has any menu at all no song list audio choices etc. and I played it on 3 home units and 2 computer units, though no fault of the band that is pathetic."
5,A Glimpse of Versailles,"A life of wealth and splendor fills the dreams of twelve-year-old Cecile Revel. When given the unexpected honor of serving in the court of King Louis XIV, she leaves home with her father's blessing and eagerly accepts a position with the Duchess of Orleans. However, life at court is far more difficult and dangerous than she ever imagined, and a single misstep could cost her her position or her life. Then tragedy strikes the royal family, and Cecile is placed under suspicion. And a dark secret from her past is suddenly revealed.Superbly written, this book offers readers of today a glimpse of the splendor and majesty of the French court in its height of glory. Through the eyes of the heroine, readers will see important events in the history of France unfold. Highly recommended for readers of all ages.For further reading of the French court, I also recommend ""The Royal Diaries: Marie Antoinette: Princess of Versailles."""
5,Great,"This book is so real. I cried with Cecile when something sad happened, and AI felt happy for her when something good happened. I found myself thinking""That's no fair!!!!!"""
2,Don't buy unless you really need it,"Its cheap but you can probably find the same topicsonline for free. Nothing new, and seems like a review book.I think there are much better references you can find online for free.I bought this book because I thought I needed for my class, but it ended upon my shelf throughout the semester."
3,for a dumb 10 year old,"Most of these ""stunts"" are bad practical jokes, pouring water on someone, etc. Given that you'd like to play a practical joke, these are hard to set up, hazardous, and not usually funny. The best use for this book is as a collection of folklore since they're attributed to various folks."
1,Very disappointed! I feel this product was a fake and not the Revlon product.,The Jontue sent was not the fragrance I am use to. It actually smelled more masculine than female. Tried all new bottles next to my original Jontue. Even my family agreed this was not Jontue. I am very disappointed since Jontue is no longer offered in the stores
1,didn't like it.,Very bad.. very very strong..not elegant at all. I made a bad choice. I bought it and never used it again.
2,"realy, 5 stars?","i bought this based on its description and the great reviews. at first i was in agreement. the scent is summery and very girly, perfect for me. but jontue fades very quickly, needing reapplication more than any other i tried. worse, the spray works only intermittently. the traditional fixes [hot water, pin through the nozzle] haven't helped.much as i enjoy the basic scent, i won't buy this again."
5,Jontue Cologne Spray,LOVE this product. Amazon.com is one of the few places I can find it AND at a reasonable price!!!
2,Boring,"Occasional Glory covers the Phillies from their inception in 1883 to 2000 and is very well researched - and as an index (a big plus for me). However, it is bogged down in stats, for instance constantly referring to players records and batting averages. While, each year is covered in this short book, I could not fall in love with the players. What made the Whiz Kids so special compared to the team of 1964? Why was Steve Carlton so beloved, and Shilling not so much? It reads like a history book, with no narrative. Also where is the Phanatic and Phil and Phillis in this book?"
2,Hollywood's version is Unenligthening,In the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' we are supposed to understand and sympathize with John Nash as he battles schizophrenia. But what astounds me about this movie is that it never explains schizophrenia. Most people still think it's that MULTIPLE PERSONALITY URBAN MYTH. They might think the imaginary roommate is personality #2.I must also add that I read the book and the movie and book are extremely different. The movie is the HOLLYWOOD VERSION. Most of the stuff in the movie is fictional.
1,Overrated Pap?,"I think so! A Beautiful Mind is ""Movie Of The Week"" material that at times seems to parody mental illness. It misses it's mark from start to finish. Russell Crowe's job wasn't Oscar worthy in my opinion. And this is quite possibly one of Ed Harris' worst on screen performances. He's such a great actor. How did he get talked into this role? Since I wasted my $...at the theater, I don't intend on wasting double that to own this disappointment. A big blemish on Ron Howard's otherwise notable directing career. Use the $$ for a pizza and a movie rental from your local video store."
2,*gag*,"i didn't like this movie at all. i was willing to give it a try but after the first half hour... i think its a little too sappy how everything turns out all right. and i think they should have included more about the truth of his life. they took out a lot about him thats actually pretty important. ok that and how it took home best adapted screenplay over lord of the rings is completely beyond me. howard totally remade the story while jackson stayed totally true. :( that and it's not very interesting, especially when you don't know what the heck is going on (maybe that's the point but some of us don't like it)"
2,"A Beautiful Mind, but.....","Perhaps not such a great picture. This is perhaps the dullest movie I've seen since Random Hearts.The story (about a brilliant mathematician who faces his own inner demons) has potential, but director Ron Howard fails to capture much of the spark of earlier films. There is little of the emotional warmth of Apollo 13 in A Beautiful Mind; were it not for the talents of the brilliant (and admittedly beautiful) Russell Crowe, this would not BE a movie. Crowe manages to carry it off, but the film fails to make an emotional connection with the viewer.Especially disappointing was the performance of the actress who plays John Nash's wife. She plays her role with too much stoicism: several times one can see Nash reaching out to her, trying to establish an emotional connection, but it never quite makes it.All in all, this is one film that proves that even a great actor can't make a film great."
2,"Very good film but,,,,,","I really wanted to like this film,,,and i tried very hard. The story is excellent and the disease is protrayed in an excellent way. But i just couldn't get past Russell Crowe. I guess it's because i just don't like him as a person and that kept getting in my way. A good actor to me has a responsibility to the public just like sports figures do. But once your title gets to big for words i'll drop that person from existance.So my review is mixed. The real story is actually better. Hollywood does what they think happened. If you really want to know about this story, read the book. The movie however is pretty good and i have always admired Ron Howard but his choice for lead was a mistake."
4,Typical Ron Howard film,"If you like Ron Howard's brand of feel-good films, and I typically don't, then this movie is for you. I am a fan of Russel Crowe, and I think he did a solid job considering the material he was given. But I came away from the movie feeling that something was lacking. There was no information about John Nash's past, and too much time was spent on showing the effects of Nash's illness on his life. The scenes about his illness tended to get repetitious. And, the major plot device in the movie was taken straight from The Sixth Sense (probably an attempt to get people to see this movie again). Overall, this movie was disappointing--certainly not worth all the rave reviews it is getting now. I would have given this movie three stars, but I had to give it an extra star because of Jennifer Connelly. She stole every scene she was in, and her beauty is simply incredible."
2,Typical Hollywood Tripe,"Far and away one of the most overrated movies of the last few years.Good acting, terrible script and music; very predictible (in fact cliched). There are far better movies of this type out there."
2,Disappointing,"Having read the book, I was quite disappointed with this movie. Sure, the movie is gripping because the story is tragically sad and the acting is pretty good. In this sense, the movie does a good of job highlighting the impact of serious mental illness and the need to help those who are dealing with it. But the problem is that the movie is about a real person, and comparison with the book (which I trust) shows that the movie left out and changed so many key elements that it represents an unacceptable distortion of the truth of John Nash's life. I could go into detail by giving many examples, but instead I urge you to simply read the book (or listen to the audiobook). The true story is far more powerful and interesting than this ridiculously popularized movie."
4,"Excellent, but not truthful","This is an excellent movie, however, it is not truthful. For example, the loving, caring, supportive wife depicted in this movie actually, in real life, left her husband only two years after he had schizophrenia. They only recently reunited. I was extremely disappointed to discover this. Also, in real life, he did not see visual hallucinations--he only heard voices. I guess this is typical of Hollywood to take a true story and twist the truth to make it sell. Excellent movie, but certainly disappointing in the above mentioned areas."
4,A Beautiful Mind?,A fascinating movie with interesting plot twists. I'm not sure I would use the adjective beautiful to describe his mind. At least there's a happy ending.
5,Absolutely the years best film,"This movie was excellent. I had no idea of the true story behind this movie, so how the producers introduced the characters (both real and imagined) was exceptional. I normally don't watch drama's, however, this is a must own."
2,Too much hype ruins fine movie,"We all know the basics of this movie: genius goes crazy, has a lot of trouble, but love of a good movie brings him back to some semblence of normality. I believe that if I had not heard how much I was going to love love love this movie, I would have liked it better.It's a fine movie, but not up to some of Crow's other films (I'm thinking of LA Confidential or Romper Stomper). Jennifer Connelly has yet to do a bad job in my book. Ed Harris is always good, and does not disappoint.The reason I give two stars is that it seems a little too self-consciously epic and sweeping, and leaves me wanting to still know more about the life these people lived. But the story is a good one, and all the actors do a good job.All in all, a good little movie for a Sunday afternoon."
4,Reasonably satisfying,"drama about the growing schizophrenia of a brilliant mathematician. Based on the story of a still-living Princeton professor, John Nash. Russell Crowe's starpower continues to amaze here as it did in Gladiator and LA Confidential. Apparently the screenplay takes some liberties with the real life of John Nash, but the subject and his filmic counterpart are interesting enough to spur some people to become interested in a variety of cool things after seeing this movie, namely economics, math, and psychiatry. Can that be all bad, naysayers?"
4,Good Movie because of Russell Crowe,"I usually enjoy Ron Howard Films&this is a Good Film but mainly because of Russell Crowe who to me Should have gotten a Co-Oscar for His Performance Here.I think He&Denzel Washington both gave Great Performance's thsi Year to Each get a Award.without Crowe's Performance this Film is another Long-winded film.the film glosses over many things in the Book&it hurts the film in that process.this film kinda reminded me of ""Rain Man"" for some strange reason.I think because the fact that Crowe is so Gifted as a Actor&His Persona was shaped rather well with the Role He was playing."
3,Anachronistic,"I remember the 50's and I know Cambridge. People didn't act that way. Rude, crude people were not admitted into polite society. (That's what made it so polite.) No man, not even a crazy one, would marry a whore. Pizza was still unheard of. Why were there girls in an MIT classroom?? How did those people pay the rent when he didn't work? And what the heck is ""overtime?"" I had understood that this was based on a true story, so I was disappointed that it was so unrealistic. Then at the end I began to understand that it is (loosely) based on someone's life. Hollywood has done it again: taken an apparently true story and made it ""relevant."" Perhaps we should call it ""Hollowwood,"" since they seem to want to hollow out everything they touch. There's a second disk, but I'm not going to bother with it."
5,Wonderful!,I thought this movie was wonderful! I must for everyone to watch! It was a beautiful movie that helped me understand this disorder more by watching this movie.
3,Skipping,"I love the movie. However, the movie was moving around within the case. it was not even pushed into place where it should have been. Also, it keeps skipping. I might just have to return and get a new one."
5,A beautiful mind,"Hard to believe to see this professor in the trailer in such a good state of mind after so many shock treatments. He must be a real genius to survive all those treatments.As far as I know, schizophrenia is not curable. A very good movie about this American genius!"
3,Overrated....yes,"I saw this movie for two reasons. I didn't think I would have to tolerate car chases and bomb blasts for two hours and the film, to be sure, relies on neither. However, I can't help but wonder why people are calling this a great movie. Although I like Mr. Crowe as an actor, his work in this film seems overly self conscious and his accent wears on you by the end of the film. The one bright star is the female lead. She is a wonderful actress and I hope to see more from her. If you want to see a truly great film get ""Remains of the Day"". Hopkings and Thompson define great acting in this film....."
2,"Don't listen to the HYPE, that's all it is.","Although this was a fairly decent film, and Russell Crowe's preformance surpasses all before, it's certianly not the best movie ever made, let alone the best of the year. It's quite long and slow, and it moves along at the pace of a very large turtle. Again it was decent although I got bored after the first couple hours and shut it off, it really wasn't Oscar worthy.On a side note, if you do want this movie, I would suggest going with the widescreen version, who want's full screen? You lose thirty percent on the sides this way."
2,An exceptionally irritating movie,"They don't pass out pens to revered professors at Princeton. And John Nash was, very briefly, a very good mathematician.This manipulative tale plays upon all sorts of prejudices --eg ""if you're that smart something else must be wrong"" and somehow manages to ignore the fact that during this period, at Princeton, the urbane, sane, funny, and more brilliant John von Neuman not only invented game theory (to which work Nash's is essentially a special case), but also was responsible for the architecture of the stored memory computer (still the model for our CPUs fifty years later), and designed much of the theoretical and practical system by for US command and control of its nuclear forces-- in short he did what Nash is presented as fantasizing about.So we have a celebratory film about a mathematician who did some good work, then went mad, and is now not so mad. That is not exactly a beautiful mind. . ."
3,A beautiful film but not an accurate one,"The acting in this film is wonderful and the some of the lines are very touching. However, the creators of the film took many liberties with the truth about this amazing man's life. Would have been just as exciting and interesting had they stuck closer to the facts."
5,well done!,"I thought this was a good movie. OK, it may not be completely accurate, but no one could argue about Russell Crowe's top notch performance. I can't believe Denzel beat him out of the best actor award. He steals the show."
2,The Oscars Got It All Wrong,"This movie was terribly slow. It reached a climax early on when he came up with his theory, and then declined. The three big awards that it received were undeserved (Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actress). Jennifer Connelly is a fine actress, but the role was not incredibly challenging (see Requiem for a better performance). On the other hand, Russell Crowe's role was extremely complex and he rose to the occasion. He should have received an Oscar for this role, and not for Gladiator. Lastly, Ron Howard should stick to less dramatic, less demanding movies. He is better off making less artistic, more entertaining movies like Parenthood and Ransom."
5,Perfect Condition,"This DVD came still in its original wrapping. I'm very happy with this purchase, as it's one of my favorite movies of all time."
3,Rent don't buy,"This was a really enjoyable movie, but at some points lacking in depth. I bought it hoping to get more out of it by multiple viewings as well as the extra material. Boy was that a mistake.The mathematics was never really explained, just shown to us by drawings. I finally bought a copy of a book on the Game Theory in Politics to understand his groundbreaking work.A great movie, it just does not have repeat quality like Gandhi or JFK. Once you see it, you see it. As a French minor, I may end up playing the French dubbed version simply to feel like I got my money's worth. Never a good sign.The stuff on the second disk was basically a waste of time to me. I'm not interested in how they made a heavy drama like this. Sure, in animation and action movies these can be interesting, but movies like this do not lend themselves to these featurettes.Still, all in all great performances by all. I recommend highly you see this movie, just don't buy it."
2,Safe and Predictable,"The filmmakers took much creative license in portraying Nash's life and ultimately rob it of any realism or pathos. If you buy in to Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly's Hollywood makeover you are rewarded with a pretty conventional love conquers all story but this would have been a better film if it were told in a small way without the big budgets, beautiful actors and artificially sweetened ending."
3,Not that beautiful.,"A Beautiful Mind is a good film but not brilliant. Russell Crowe does a fine job as College professor John Nash but the real magic performance goes to Jennifer Connelly, she is truly amazing as Nash's understanding wife. Ron Howard is a fantastic director but this film is probably is most flawed. A Beautiful Mind is an important film but it left me disappointed."
5,A Beautiful Mind,"There is not much more to say about this movie except that it is excellent. You may have to watch it more than once to really understand the seriousness of mental illness. Anyone that has any type of mental illness in their life-whether themselves or a family or friend will completely be able to relate to this movie. It is done beautifully, tastefully and carefully. Also a true story."
5,A Beautiful Mind,"I purchased this DVD through Amazon because of the price, availability and delivery. I incorporated it into a mental health unit for high school students. The students loved the movie- it took three days of classs to view- and I got good feedback from them regarding the characters mental health issues. An excellent movie for all to see- can open up many eyes regarding the diagnosis, treatment and stigmatism associated with mental health illnesses."
3,"Great Movie, it seems the director was a little creative tho","Anyone who knows the real story of John Nash will be astonished at how different it is to this movie. I thought this movie was excellent as a movie, but as a story about someone's life, the creative license applied is unforgiveable..."
5,I love this movie!,"I absolutely love this movie, I am so glad I got Blu-ray and DVD version. The special features such as deleted scenes really are nice."
4,Who Knew?,This being a true story made this movie even more interesting. I enjoyed this movie and will watch it again some day.
4,Touching and Emotional Drama With Wonderful Performances,"A Beautiful Mind, based on a true story, is an emotional and terrifically acted drama that qualifies as one of Russell Crowe's best performances to date. Crowe is absolutely brilliant as John Nash, a gifted but troubled genius and his journey through life. Jennifer Gardner portrays John's faithful wife and is more than deserving of the Oscar she won for her role in the film. The movie deals with sensitive subjects, such as conspiracy theories and mental illness, but does so in a touching way that ultimately leaves the audiences feeling uplifted."
4,Great performances but oversimplification of schizophrenia,"Was interested in seeing this movie after viewing an interview of Ron Howard by Charlie Rose on PBS. I've enjoyed a number of his films in the past, and wondered how he would tackle this complex story. I was so swept away by his delusions, I was disappointed to learn that they were mere products of his imagination. Had heard talk of the psychological community not fully appreciating this film because it gives the false impression that schizophrenia is curable, when most cases are in fact not. Still, an engaging movie, and I was surprised to see so many viewers in Honolulu for what I thought might be a ""hard sell"". Due to the strength of his performance, Russell Crowell carries the film, and for this should be applauded. I attended the film with a classmate who teaches courses in psychology, and she agrees with my assessment."
5,Excellent Movie,The most compelling movie I have ever seen. Ron Howard at his best. Eight acadamy award nominations is not enough. I have seen it twice and plan to go again.
2,Reality would have been better than fiction,"This movie turned me off with its focus on Nash's schizophrenia rather than his monumental achievements. Three-fourths of the movie turns out to be Nash's delusion. I felt like a voyeur, entertained by someone else's pain. At the end, I wasn't even certain of exactly what it was that Nash had developed....just that he was a brilliant mathematician and severely ill. The barbaric ""medical treatment"" of the 1950s left me feeling sick.A documentary would have been far more entertaining. Nash is a brilliant man despite, not because of, his illness, and I found this movie (especially since much of it is fictionalized) to be exploitive. Only two stars."
2,"Over-hyped, Boring, Cheesy as Macaroni!!!","This is to me, a classic example of critics being in love with a movie for its ""movie qualities"" but the finished product stinks! Get out the gas masks and the pooper scooper for this one!Though the movie is mildly entertaining in the middle portion of the movie for about 15-20 minutes, the opening of the movie is very boring and the ending very, very cheesy! I understand that this was based on a true story, so the ending is what the ending is, and if this movie hadn't of been so over-hyped it wouldn't alteast had the ""let-down factor"" to it!Best thing about the movie is Jennifer Connelly, great actress and what a hottie!However, I can not believe that this movie won Best Picture of the Year! Actually, on second thought I can believe it - it is always these boring movies with some supposendly ""meaningful"" storyline and sappy ending that win in Hollywood. What a joke!"
3,Not worth the Oscars.,"Definitely an overrated movie. I almost walked out during the first 10 minutes or so. Bad acting and cliche situations. At its worst when he has his 'brilliant' idea at university which is demonstrated by the girl in the red dress. But luckily it got a little better after that. Russell Crowe's excellent acting compensated for a lot. He plays a realistic over-focused nerd, although in my experience, people like that are not as good as self-evaluation (the silly-old-me routine) as this character seems to be. The casting for his wife is not very well done. She is just too beautiful for him. And although miracles do happen, I kept wondering what she saw in him.On the whole, not a waste of money, but not a must-see."
1,Bland and inoffensive,"A very boring movie. Yes, it might get the facts about schizophrenia correct, and Russell Crowe's peformance might be an accurate depiction of the surface symptoms of schizophrenia, but that doesn't make it a good movie.The script is one gimmick after another. The direction is completely pedestrian. The entire enterprise is dull and predictable.To be fair, Crowe does his best, but he can't transcend the essential dullness of Ron Howard's TV Movie Of The Week direction."
1,"a very sad written, over hyped, Film.","This movie film too much to play twists on the audience. Through-out the entire movie you try to figure out whether Crow is truly insane, then the director throws more tiresome scenes into the mix. In the end this film tries too hard to be Dramatic & loses its focus mid-movie."
2,A Beautiful Mind confuses my mind,"Despite all the great reviews, I must say that, while I washooked at the beginning of the movie, I slowly drifted into confusion. It was difficult for me to distinguish fantasyagainst reality, and so about maybe a third of the waysI couldn't understand who/what the heck the government agentwas and why he and the little girl kept on appearing and reappearing before Crowe's eyes. It was just very confusingto me and thus wasn't satisfied with this movie."
4,A Beautiful Movie,"The story of a genius mathmatician at his onset of schizophrenia. At the time Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia it was thought that only insulin shock, medicine, and a stress-free life could allow him to function with the schizophrenia. The medical treatments cost him his ability to solve mathmatical equations and ability to function. As a man of logic he decided to take the disorder into his own hands. Since Nash had always had a gift for solving irrational problems why couldn't he solve this one? I am sure that what Hollywood has given us in this film is far from the truth of what really happened with John Nash, but it was a nice story. The movie is charged with great actors. Plus some of the deleted scenes are actually worth watching, a rare find."
4,Questioning Reality,"It sometimes seems like geniuses live in their own world, apart from the rest of us. In A Beautiful Mind, John Nash, who would later become a Nobel-prize winning Mathemetician, does live in a world of his own. He is a schizophrenic, unable to distinguish between reality and his own imaginings.The people he has imagined seemed so real that I could feel his world crumble when he discovered that he really wasn't part of a top-secret government organization, and that his jocular college roomate is not real either.Russell Crowe makes an amazing transition from playing a tortured, conflicted man struggling with a greater power(Commodus) in the mask of a gladiator to playing a tortured, conflicted man struggling with a greater power(schizophrenia) in the mask of a genius.This is such a unique story for making a movie about, but it works."
5,An ode for human achivement,"(for people who know what the movie is about)Most times people think human achivement lies outside of him, in history or technology or intelectual advancement. This heart felt movie is about the prime human achivement over our primordial companion... our mind.One of the main discoveries of psicology and quantum physics is that there is no TRUTH but only perceptions... our interpretations. This movie is about a man strogle with his version of reality and coming to terms with it.I believe most people think he is special because he had a high IQ... actually I believe is because he helped himself to live in health regardless of his illness.He is a true example of the best humans are capable of doing... he reminded me how much love is the first and last important aspect of life"
5,A Beautiful Mind,One of the most unusual and insightful views of the mechanics of a schizophrenic mind. It depicts the extraordinary courage of a man who triumphed over mental illness to achieve great things. Amazing movie!
5,A Beautiful Mind,"Exciting to the last minute. Especially when you are interested in special ed kids, this is an excellent example how some brains work or dysfunction... Till; the last minute you are not sure about the outcome. Excellent movie!"
4,beautiful movie,"For me, the movie easily held my attention through, a docudrama that is based in reality but perhaps acceptably dramatized for movie sake. For those interested in a journey through the life of someone with a mental condition, and efforts to cope, this movie is probably for you. If such concepts are not something you have the slightest interest in, there will be better movies for you. I was wondering how anyone could rate this 1 or 2, but after reading such posts I could also see from their perspective while clearly having a different perspective. I liked the movie a lot, and have watched it on a couple of occasions.It would have been better if there was more information presented, medically or biologically regarding Nash's Schizophrenia, or simply Schizophrenia in general. I think that viewers enjoying such movies would have appreciated this, but this was certainly thought of from the production team and I respect the movie for what it is. A beautiful movie."
3,"Good movie, even if it does stretch the facts","""A Beautiful Mind"" is based on the life of John Nash, a brilliant mathmetician who also happened to suffer from schizophrenia. Although the film has received criticism because it is not 100% accurate, it is a great story. To be honest, most true stories need to be embellished some anyway in order to be entertaining.I cannot divulge too much information about the plot of the movie because you will get some major surprises along the way that should not be spoiled, but just know that you will laugh and cry and be frustrated along with the characters.Why 3 stars? While this was a solid movie, definitely worth a rental, I can't say that it makes my list of all-time favorites. It is a great story that deserves to be seen, and there is nothing necessarily wrong with it. There's just not much more to it that makes it worthy of 4 or 5 stars."
2,A terrific DVD of a deeply overpraised film.,"A very silly film. Russell Crowe appears to be channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rainman.Jennifer Connelly is possibly the most beautiful actress on the face of the earth.The real star of this overblown biopic-by-numbers is the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins. I also quite liked James Horner's score.The film spends 2 hours telling us that Nash is a nut and then in it's final 20 minutes shifts gears and asks us to believe he is a genius.Connelly deserves better. This critically lauded script made me blush. How long does it take to write lines this cringe-inducing?Why doesn't it say ""loosely based on a true story"" before the opening scene?This quite handsome 2 disc DVD is stuffed with additional items. Alas I expected deleted scenes showing us Nash the anti-Semitic closet case. No such luck as this is Hollywood.How sad that some believe this to be the best film of 2001.And if I didn't say this before, Jennifer Connelly derserves better."
3,"Good, but overrated","Great acting by Crowe & Connelly. And thanks to the extremely talented Ron Howard, this otherwise ""dry"" story comes to life & keeps you interested.This movie is definitely worth seeing, and possibly even worth owning. However, while it was worthy of some of the awards it was granted, it lacks the creativity that ought to be required for ""Best Picture"" accolades, in my opinion.But ""Human Interest"" stories always pull on the heart-strings, and this one did it well...well enough to get the necessary votes from the Academy. In short, in 10-15 years, I do not believe this will be thought of as a ""classic""."
2,Hollywood again...,"The film emphasizes Nash's wild childishness and insanity, which apparently were true, but conveys no sense of either the depth or breadth of Nash's mathematical creativity and contributions. Nasar's book of the same title is far better and is far more informative, although it receives some reasonable criticism in Mirowski's 'Machine Dreams' (where the question 'What does it feel like to play a Nash equilibrium?' is posed). For an even better history of game theory, RAND, military funding of science, and simultaneously a biography of von Neumann, read Poundstone's 'Prisoner's Dilemma' (which Nasar quotes abundantly in her book 'A Beautiful Mind'). One interesting point conveyed by the film: that Nash managed his insanity by learning to ignore the voices in his head. If true, then this would be an impressive lesson for others."
4,Outstanding Performance by Russell Crowe,"A Beautiful Mind gives a glimpse of the struggles people face with mental disorders. For the most part, most of them are not aware they suffer from such a disease of the mind. The world becomes complicated to them and its difficult to differentiate between the imagination and reality. I saw this movie a few years ago and once it was released on blu-ray I had to have it. I am a psychology major and this brought life to many of the disorders I have studied. This is a beautiful movie not only about the complexities of the mind but also about love. Although he was suffering from this uncontrollable disease his wife stood by him and nurtured him. Many people are not that lucky especially when an illness arise. I recommend this movie to people who are intrigued by what goes on in the mind of someone with schizophrenia and also to witness what true love can bring to a persons life."
2,Best Picture of 2001? Hardly...,"2001 - the year of Black Hawk Down, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and Training Day... and yet A Beautiful Mind snags the Best Picture Oscar? I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind is COMPLETELY without redemption as a motion picture, but it comes complete with all the sappy Hollywood sentiment director Ron Howard could conjure. This isn't real emotion, it's melodrama, which is best left for daytime television. Is this movie more important than Black Hawk Down, more spectacular than The Fellowship of the Ring, or more original than Training Day? No. Definitely not. This movie wasn't made for an audience - it was made with an Oscar in mind. That's not good policy."
4,Great film!,"I loved this film. Russell Crowe was great! This is one of the best films of the year. The performances were out of this world! Ron Howard proves that he has grown up, and moved on to bigger things. This was a great film, with a great message about a disorder that is so hard for so many people around the world. Go see it, and be moved.The only problem that I had with this film was that the whole time that Crowe's character was seeing things, NOT ONCE did he see a Smurf. If he had seen atleast a few of them, the impact of the film would have been greater!Aside from that, go see this marvelous film from Dreamworks!"
4,Watch as Entertainment Only,"This movie is an excellent movie, well written and directed and Russell Crowe's acting is outstanding. Unfortunately, Mr. Howard's vision of John Nash's delusion is way off base and pure hype to increase the entertainment value of the movie. It's still worth watching, but I'd recommend the book if you want to get a more complete perspective."
3,Formulaic But Not Terrible,"I'm not sure why all the hype about the film, much less the Oscar nod. It's a typical Ron Howard button-pusher with a good cast. I found it a bit slow at times but it finished strong.One total anomaly that is typical Hollywood is the Jennifer Connelly character. I'm grateful that I got to look at her and not Camryn Manheim for 2+ hours, but I for one find it unreasonable that she would hit on Nash in the first place, let alone marry him. He was awkward, antisocial, and rough-looking and a long, long way from smooth with the ladies. It's on the same scale of implausability as Helen Hunt falling for Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As it Gets"".(By extension, I wonder how well ""Speed"" would have done if instead of Reeves and Bullock in the lead roles, they had, say, Dennis Franz and Rosie O'Donnell. But I digress.)"
4,"A Great ""Feel Good"" Movie, But Pure Fiction","... The acting, directing and screenwriting were stellar. The only disappointment for me was that the movie was a whitewashed type of feel good vehicle for Ron Howard to do his typical (and typically well done) ""triumph of the human spirit"" silliness. That doesn't cut down on the enjoyment factor, but it does mislead viewers into believing that John Nash, the subject of the movie, was a more wholesome person than history tells us he was. The movie leaves out all of the unsavory moments in Nash's life, from his alleged torturing of animals as a child to his prior marriage and adultery (and some worse). As a result, the audience learns to sympathize with a person who may not at all be sympathetic in real life. As I said, it makes for a great movie, but don't go believing it."
4,Overrated,"Good film and performances from Crowe and Connely. Their best? I don't think so. You want to see their best performances...Go rent/buy L.A. Confidental or The Insider...go rent/buy Requeim for a Dream. Now, those are some fantastic performances and films.Oscar for Howard? That just proves that the Oscars are a huge marketing joke! Where was Spielberg and A.I.??? How about Lynch and Mulholland Drive??? What about Jackson and LOTR??? Where was Nolan and Memento?!?!?"
4,good for what it is but not what it should be,"This is typical Hollywood schlock: a heartwarming story that just screams ""OSCAR!""However... did you know that John Nash was bisexual? That he divorced his wife in 1963 and fathered a child out of wedlock? That his son was also a schizophrenic and gifted mathematician, but spent most of his life in institutions?It seems as if content and the true story of Nash's life was spared to keep a PG-13 rating and the voters of the Academy Awards feeling warm and fuzzy. Admittedly, though, this movie does a good job of doing what it's supposed to: making its viewers leave the theater happy and as if they just viewed a work of art about a man with a ""beautiful mind,"" regardless of how inaccurately that mind was portrayed.I liked this movie as a typical Hollywood movie, but not as a biopic of John Nash's life."
3,A Beautiful Lie,"If you are planning to buy or rent this movie to know the story of John Nash, you should read the book instead. The only similarity between the movie and the biography was that he was nuts and he was brilliant.Another review mentioned this was the true story of John Nash. Nothing can be further from the truth. In the movie Nash was working for the government to protect against the Russians. In his bio he was actually talking to space aliens about forming a world government. Also there was no mention of Nash's many relationships with men in the movie.A few other facts about Nash not mentioned in the movie was that he has an illegitimate son. He was not the loving, caring husband the movie made him out to be. In fact he was a real jerk for a long time. He didn't even try to care for anyone.I saw the movie and then read the book. I still think ""A Beautiful Mind"" was a good movie, but it wasn't even close to being an accurate protrayal of Nash."
1,"Lies, Lies,Lies","This boring as hell movie not only lied, blatently and thoroughly, but it didn't even spell out the theory (beyond a hazy bar scene) that won him the Nobel prize..."
1,So Cliché !!!,"This movie is so predictable. It's like the director worked backward: instead of directing the movie and then see what people think about it, he kept thinking about what people would like to see, and then made the movie (that explains why it won so many awards). He could at least have done this a little more subtle, but the whole movie is gross. Here's an example: Ron Howard needed a genius, right? So what did he do? Did he tried to narrow Nash's personality? No! He gave us the typical genius guy everybody would think of, you know, the guy who can't talk to girls, can't wear a tie... And there are so many other gross details in this movie, the worst being this ""love-can-solve-any-problems"" thing.This is soooooooo easy, so predictable, in a word, so CLICHE."
3,A CONFUSING MASTERPIECE,"The protagonist John Nash,a mathematic genius,is so talented that he increasingly becomes pshycotic.During the movie the viewer becomes more and more confused and will not be able to understand ""A BEAUTIFUL MIND"" straightaway.That is the reason for just 3 out of 5 stars.Russel Crowe presents in an amazing way the illness of John Nash.To my mind you have to see the movie at least twice to understand this masterpiece.My recommandation:do not despair during the movie because in the end you will check it all.It is worth to see it,but not a must."
1,Expected More,"I heard that this was a great movie, so I decided to rent it. I was very disappointed with the movie. Most of the time, I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. I definitely would not recomment this movie to anyone."
1,Who gave this more than 1 star????,This was probably the most confusing (& boring) movie I've tried to watch in a long time. The critics gave it such rave reviews that I should have known it would be a real snore!
1,Don't waste your time or $,"I absolutely, 150% HATED this movie!... After getting so many great reviews and winning 4 Oscars, I was excited to see this movie. What a disappointment it turned out to be! The acting wasn't terrible on the actors and actresses part, but the whole plot was horrific! I can't believe this movie got such great reviews! ... It's such a shame such an amazing and inspiring story was put to pieces."
1,A Beautiful Mind- Why Should I Mind?,"I started watching A Beautiful Mind expecting to be wowed away by a deep look at overcoming mental illness. Instead, the movie was plodding, predictable, and dull. It's pretty obvious Nash is having delusions. The only mysteries are what he actually did that was important, and how he put up with Jennifer Conelly's overexaggerated agitation. The movie was made to win awards, and I have a feeling some audiences (and Oscar voters) just couldn't admit to themselves that a movie about mental illness could be just plain bad. Especially ""beautiful"" are the glaring omissions of Nash's other problems that make him seem a little less of a gentlemanly genius. It doesn't matter how many special features are on the DVD. If the movie is bad, they aren't going to save it."
2,Didnt care for it,"I got this movie because of all the hype. I really didnt care for the story at all. Very depressing. Crowe did a great job of acting the part, but the overall story didnt grab me.I would save big bucks and rent the DVD first, then decide if you want to spend the bucks to add it to your collection."
3,read the book,"If you truly like this movie..take the time to read the book. You will find its not as charming as the movie and the abuse and harm he caused was of great concern. He is a genius, but it was not a goverment caused stress..it was plain and simple mental illness. Their wedding was not all rainbows and unicorns..they were divorced for many years while he was locked up or traveling aboard. He was selfish and drained his mothers and family's finances. Read the book to find out how it really was."
4,Saved by Russell Crowe,"Let's face it, this is basically a made-for-TV movie with Ron Howard directing with his typical paint-by-numbers approach. What saves it is the outstanding acting of Russell Crowe. I'm amazed how a man with such a powerful build could appear so fragile. Without him, this would only be a two star movie. I can only imagine what this film could have been under the direction of David Lynch or Robert Altman."
4,Great Movie!!!,This movie really makes you see what mental illness can do to a person. Crowe plays what I believe to be the role of his career!A must see movie!!!
2,A Big Disappointment...,"After all the hype and Oscars, I thought I'd better get around to watching ""A Beautiful Mind"". While the first half of the film steers you completely and deliberately in the wrong direction... which is very clever when the secret is revealed, after this the second half of the film seems to go downhill toward a typical Hollywood-esque weepy finale. While I really tried to like the main character, Mr Nash, I found I didn't really care! After the closing titles rolled, I felt the film was desperately trying to out-do ""Shine"".. but with all the film's fancy camera work and ageing make up, it didn't quite manage it. If you want to watch a film about mental illness which has great acting and real emotion... Watch ""Shine""!"
3,Read the book instead for the real story,"Beautiful Mind (2001), starring Russel Crowe and Jennifer Conneley, is a decent movie. It's well acted and well directed by Ron Howard. It's largely based on the biography of the same title by Sylvia Nassar (1998). However, in order to ""Hollywood-ize"" the story, a great deal of detail and ""reality"" were dropped.My main beef with the movie is that it's depiction of schizophrenia is ludicrous...basically, the entire disease is trivialized as visual hallucinations. Even the movie's ending makes no sense where John Nash is depicted as still suffering from seeing imaginary people. Anyone who knows the true story knows that Nash today, if not entirely cured, doesn't see imaginary people and never did!For the true story, and all the messy details that come with real-life, read the book instead."
3,What?,"I saw the movie before its Oscar success. I was dissapointed in the movie then and very dissapointed it won ""Best Picture"". Its not as moving or emotional as I would expect....and the story line dissapointed me.....I actually thought the main character was going to get involved with the government and the cold war, etc. (I obviously did not know the story of Nash prior to my viewing!) thinking it would be an action-drama style movie. He's insane? What? What a rip-off. If he contributed to the world of math, the movie didn't really develope his contribution...I think I would have enjoyed the movie better if they had explored that more than the insanity stuff. I was reading Neal Stephenson's most excellent book ""Cryptonomicon"" at the time and I thought this movie was in the same line. Well, I still gave it 3 stars, which is average....definitely not best picture."
2,was it that great???,"i don't understand. best picture? best director?best supporting actress? and best adapted screenplay?there's nothing, absolutely nothing creative and amusingabout the director's filming, and picture.jennifer connely proved her talent in Requiem for a Dream,but i think anyone could have done this part.there were many many stories similar to this, and nothingmakes this man's life better than all the other peoplewho lived a dramatic life. yes, it's a good movie,a good story, but very typical and boring.it definitely didn't deserve all the attention."
3,Not deserving of Best Film of the year,"The Lord of the Rings was a superior film in every way; acting, drama, design, cast, effects, story, directing, production, etc. etc. etc. etc.In 5 years from now people are going to say, ""Beautiful wha?"" ""Huh?""The Lord of the Rings is a timeless, epic masterpiece that was robbed by the academy because of the simple & sad fact that they felt like they owed their own (Ron Howard) after snubbing his earlier (and better) films.So sad."
3,Not the true story,"I was disappointed that this movie did not tell the full story of John Nash. I read the biography, and it is so completely different than the movie. The film did give a realistic interpretation of mental illness, but it strayed from the facts too much for me. I did love Russell Crowe's performance, and he deserves the recognition that he is receiving for his acting performance. I just wish the script would have been more true to the facts."
1,ron howard never took an econ course,"this movie confused the hell out of me, probably because i read the book (excellent).unfortunately terribly inaccurate and unnecessarily sentimental fluff in hollywood = garner awards and praisethat blonde in the bar scene is just awful and a completely incorrect notion of a nash equilibrium."
1,A Tribute to a slow movie,I was very disappointed in this one. It was so slow in places that I almost went to sleep twice. The story might have been better if it were really taken from true life. The movie only showed his second wife and did not show his children from his previous marriage that from all accounts he abandoned. Realism is usually better than a contrived story line.
1,Best Picture [bad movie],"A Beautiful Mind will go down in history as one of the most overhyped and least deserving of the Oscar winners. The acting is fine, but the story is so overblown and phoney that it is practically comical..."
2,Great movie - Poor ego,"I think this would be a great movie if anyone other than Mr. Crowe was the leading charactor. He is too into himself, and that leaks through all of his charactors, which are always the same person. He obviously has no depth or versatility."
1,I walked out,"The character of John Nash had no redeeming qualities -- he had no social skills, was crude, and didn't seem to do anything (didn't go to classes as a student or teacher). The whole tone of the movie was depressing. I don't know where they got the title ""A Beautiful Mind"" -- nothing was beautiful about the movie or the character.I walked out of the movie because I didn't see how any ending could make this movie ""beautiful""!"
5,Beautiful Direction: Harrowing and Moving - Crowe was Robbed,"One of the most harrowing films I've seen depicting mental illness, A BEAUTIFUL MIND will forever change the way you look at that person talking to himself in the street. Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash is a 180-degree turn from his Oscar-winning GLADIATOR role; a man of imposing physicality, he somehow actually manages to make himself appear fragile. The rawness of his terror and sadness - especially in the horrifying insulin-treatment scene - will stay with you forever. He was robbed of a second consecutive Oscar. The awards should be about merit but are no more than a self-congratulatory popularity contest; watch Crowe's performance in this film, and you will see the performance of the Best Actor of the Year, and of his generation."
5,Another Incredible Performance,"Another Performance that Russell Crowe deserves the Oscar for...He was mesmerizing, taking the audience on a journey into the madness of mental illness....so believable it was scary...a must see for everyone.. The love story Crowe and Connelly created was a Gem..Loved It."
5,and the Nominees are,"Russell Crowe got robbed - I demand a recount. Jennifer was great, but he needs more props. Wonderful film. Fantastic music. Magical locations and scenery."
5,Crowe shines with great finesse in this difficult role,"AFter Cinderella Man, this is my second favorite movie done by Crowe. Ron Howard the director and Crowe made a billiant collaboration here. All the actors were superb. No one else could have played Nash like Crowe did. He should have won an Oscar for this. I love the musical score as well. Captivating. A must see by all."
2,<shrug>,"Not that I expected a documentary, but playing John Nash's delusions straight for the bulk of the film and then jumping out and yelling ""Surprise!"" reminded me a bit of the Ewings trying to pick up their lives after Bobby died, in ""Dallas,"" and then having him show up in the shower the following season because Pam was dreaming for all of last season. It was a cheap trick.This film exploited Nash's schizophrenic hallucinations at the expense of the very real handicaps he had to overcome, and I didn't appreciate it one bit."
4,STRANGE-BUT-TRUE!!! A WELL-MADE DRAMA!!!,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a well made drama chronicling events in the life of John Nash, a genius with schitzophrenia. I particularly thought that his willingness to fight this disease without medication or shock therapy (after several failed attempts to do so) was really stupid, but it proved to work out just fine! All the actors give fine performances in this film (even those who play the ""imaginations"" are good). A good, solid film! Grade: A-"
5,A Beautiful Actor...,"I received this DVD as a Christmas Present, and I cannot even BEGIN to recall how many times I have watched it! Put simply, it is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. The only complaint that I have is that Russell Crowe was not awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. He is a brilliant, beautiful actor, and ""A Beautiful Mind"" would have never won Best Picture without him!"
5,Two thumbs way up!,"A Beautiful Mind was, simply, a wonderful movie. It had me laughing and crying throughout. It was shot beautifully and Russell Crowe was amazing as John Nash. I sincerely hope that this movie wins some Oscars because it deserves them. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, go out and rent it right now. Trust me, you won't regret it."
2,diappointed,"Disappointing movie so I don't know why it won many accolades at the Golden Globes. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a real schizophrenic mathematic genius was good. But Crowe's own seemingly charismatic, virile, and magnetic personality take away some believability. Jennifer Connelley gives a fine performance. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer play minor characters but nevertheless are pleasure to watch. The guy who plays Nash's roommate ""Charles"" is entertaining as he did in the ""Knights Tale"". So I wonder why did this movie fell short of entertaining me? Maybe it took too long to tell a good story."
2,Formulaic,"Ron Howard took a story with great potential and turned it into a sentimentally formulaic film that the stodgy Academy will most certainly adore. Too much time is spent leading up to Nash's breakdown. Howard rushes us through 30 years of Nash's life in 30 minutes time. The drama and true depth of this story can be found in Nash's lifetime attempt to manage his disease, and not simply in the events that lead up to his hospitalization and relatively brief treatment period."
2,"Poor, the Lord of The Rings should have won Best Picture","This is a poor movie. The story is unrealistic and un-engaging, the directing is poor and the music is dull and repetitive. This movie is severely over-rated. This movie demonstrates that any movie, properly marketed can win an academy award."
2,"Interesting, if you are really into Hemingway",Quite interesting book if you are a real fan of Hemingways and just have to read all biographies. If not: stay away and read for example books on Ernest Hemingways life by Michael Reynolds or good old Carlos Baker instead.
3,not well written,"sad to admit, hard to say--but not well written at all. truth is ernest was the only writer in the family. what can you do? it still may be worth reading to some in order to get his younger brother's perspective on things, etc."
4,Enjoyable character driven story,"I enjoyed reading this book. The characters were believeable and the vaudeville background and plot kept my interest. Ms. McCracken has the gift of a wonderful story teller as she recounts the lives of Mose and Rocky and the interesting family and people they experience in their dual biographies. There comes laughter and tears in the tale of these two fascinating men. The only flaw in the plot was the threat Rocky laid on Mose. I was really disappointed in him, as though Rocky were a real person. I enjoyed the ending as realistic and consistent, but some may see this part of the conclusion as a downer. Overall in ""Niagra Falls All Over Again"" I found an enjoyable read with characters that stay with you after the story ends, only to emphasize just how important empathetic characters are in a good novel. I intend to read other books by this excellent author."
3,Niagra Falls All Over Again,"It's a slow read at first but nonetheless it is a moving tale about the relationship of two comedic partners from beginning to end and a before these two characters known as Rocky Carter and Mike Sharp first met. The experiences these two men go through individually, together, privately and/or publicly and seems to have more of a marital relationship than just a partnership is written clearly well but it is definitely not for the reader of traditional romance. If you're into the slap-stick comedies of black and white television before tv and movie's came in color and love the Three Stooges and the antics of Ollie and Stan, this is the book for you."
3,New England Lit?,This book had a slow start that lead for the desire for speedier events. The characters Mose and Rocky were absolutely endearing. Elizabeth McCracken does a wonderful job developing the characters and forces the reader to both sympathize and love Mose Sharp. The continuous tragedy and loss of loved ones in Mose's life ushers the reader to continue to read in hopes of a happy ending. A very good read once past the slow introduction.
4,A New Flavor!,"Elizabeth McCracken's Niagara Falls All Over Again is not the type of book I would be typically drawn to, which is why I found it to be such a great story. It starts slow, yet as soon as the pace picks up you find yourself falling in love with Carter & Sharp and their complex relationship. Its flavored with humor, tragedy, punch lines, love and the ultimate betrayal which ends Carter & Sharps ""marriage."" McCracken's ability to write from a mans perspective about life in vaudeville is a success in itself. If you want to read something out of the ordinary, Niagara Falls All Over Again will suit your taste."
2,"Details, Details, Details",Elizabeth McCracken did a wonderful job portraying the risks and heartaches to becoming famous. She showed the relationship between the two main characters as almost a marriage. Their failures and successes were portrayed as real life. This book is full of so much detail that it was almost a turn off to reading it. McCracken did her research that is for sure. I suggest that you take a full weekend and dedicate it to reading this book.
4,Just wasn't hungry,"I enjoyed this book because Elizabeth McCracken is so good at her craft. Anything she'd choose to write about I'd read, just to hear the fresh metaphors, just to see the way she strings sentences along, just for the pleasure of rolling my eyes over her well sculpted paragraphs.But the characters of Rocky Carter and Mose Sharp didn't really interest me. The story has a smooth, frosted feeling to it-like the author baked a cake and decorated it in an absolutely gorgeous way. I want to look at it, but I don't actually want to ingest it; a lovely creation but lacking in nutritional value. A great read it if that's exactly what you're in the mood for: a well made, beautiful, dessert."
2,"Believable Story That Starts Out Slow, but Ends Well","Although the first 80 pages or so seemed to drag on forever, the end result is worth it. The book started out slow, and just when I felt like putting it down, it hooked me. The protagonist, Mose Sharp, is a very believable character, who causes the reader to sympathize with the horrible details of his life, such as the many deaths of family members. His character does not seem to embellish any details of his life. He tells the reader, that he reveals secrets to us that he does not reveal to the other characters.The character of Rocky, Mose's counterpart, is more comical, and more charming than Mose himself. He adds much humor to the book. However, I would still only give the book two stars. A five star book would have captivated my attention from the get go."
3,"slow it done a notch, please.","the book started off kind of sluggish quickly for me, it 'migrated back to interesting. While reading this novel, trying to pinpoint New England elements I found the read particulary flowing. The way the history is told, jumping back and forth from ""Mose"" memory bank went well with the novel. the characters were very believable which helped with the first person point of view. good- well -read-lots of information handed out."
3,Niagara Falls all over again,"""Niagara.."" starts a little slow but picks up about a third of the way through. If your interested in vaudeville, or a fan of famous comedy acts like Laurel and Hardy or the Three Stooges, then this is the book for you."
2,too good to be so lazy,"carter and sharp exist in a world that contains abbott and costello (they are referred to more than once). yet the author has no problem basing events of this book on things that happened to a&c. when a&c started on radio, people couldn't tell them apart, so costello raised the pitch of his voice. this happens with carter & sharp. costello losing his baby during the run of his radio show happens around the same time that it happens to sharp. when television came, abbott and costello were part of a group of rotating hosts for the colgate comedy hour. lo and behold, this happend to carter & sharp. you'd think sharp would at least comment on the fact that his life so closely parallels that of costello. there's a lot of good, deep, original stuff in the book. it's just too bad mccracken couldn't come up with her own version of these more famous incidents. ps--loved the clever hans reference."
4,Slowly I Turned...Loudly I Laughed,"A rip roaring, hilarious novel about a vaudeville team. I know the world of stand up comedy and duos very well and this book sums it up perfectly. The insanity that happens to teams, the egos, the hard work and instant gratification. I had to keep putting the book down as I was laughing out loud. Gosh, I am envious! A terrific book."
3,Cute and entertaining.,"McCracken writes the story of the Great American Partnership, with its highs and lows, in an overall entertaining tale. But the book is somewhat unmoving: its funniest passages don't make one laugh out loud, and its saddest moments hardly make one weep.It would make a great beach book, as it presents a wonderful escape from one's own life; the characters are deep and draw the reader in. It's also a great book for anyone with an interest in vaudeville or early Hollywood."
5,What a Talent McCracken Is!,"It isn't often that one can find a book that a) successfully portrays the sweep of a man's life, from childhood to old age, and b) provides such a profoundly satisfying read. These are characters one comes to know intimately, emotionally, and care about thanks to McCracken's gift with language and storytelling. As a magazine reviewer, I've had to read far too many grotesque and sensationalistic new books by alienated young male writers lately; this tour-de-force was a relief and a delight."
3,What I don't like....,"I do like the wheels being at the bottom when the stand is open... wheels that go to the top are useless. I do like that the saw is so easy to mount or dismount. But I don't like that the risers that support your work are square tube that is considerably smaller than the pockets they fit into, which makes the riser lean badly when you tighten down the knob. The risers are so out of plumb that it causes wider boards to ""twist"", so that your work doesn't lay flat on your saw's cutting table. With smaller mouldings, such as quarter-round, the support ""T""s are so out of level that the moulding flips over.I e-mailed the company through their ""contact us"" form, but they never replied."
3,Hope I Got the Exception,"cons:All the multilingual instruction pages were scrambled so I had to unstaple all the pages, re-sort them, and staple them back together.Though the stand is painted orange as in the online pictures, the instruction diagrams are only black and white and are fairly dark so it's difficult to see which end of the stand they're talking about.During assembly, one step calls for screwing a t-handle bolt into the welded-to-the-stand nut. One of the welded nuts had weld flashing or something on the back thread so the bolt can't go all the way down to lock one of the extension arms. So, I had to tap the thread to fix it.Pros:Fortunately, assembly is fairly intuitive so it's easy enough to put everything together just using the picture on the box. Also, the stand does work well and is pretty sturdy."
5,Good so far,"I took this tent to the post office and weighed it, and it came in at 7 lbs 15.6 ounces, which is about 7.5 lbs. The floor is a little thin, so I think I'm gonna get a footprint for it. The poles are aluminum and seem really durable. One thing to be noted is that the inside size is not 8'x8'. It's more like 7.5'x7.5'. The size of the tent refers to the distance between the ends of the poles, not the interior space. It's easy to put up, easy to take town, and easy to fit in its carrying bag.I haven't used it in the rain yet, so I can't say anything about its water resistance or durability. I'll update this review later after I get more use out of it."
1,not even waterproof :(,"Why advertised as a 4 season tent, based on price alone I knew it wasn't. That would have been fine. I really just needed a standard tent that was closed up a little more for cooler weather. By cooler weather, I mean north Texas, not Canada.My first camping trip probably would have been fine but I got a little rain. Unfortunately, the doors leaked like a sieve.I'm not sure what to do with the tent now. A previous reviewer commented that his was headed to the trash. I am seriously considering this with mine."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm a portrait/wedding photographer who is just starting out on my own. I thought this book would be helpful to get more business. Unfortunately, this book is geared more towards someone who wants to sell their work to advertising agencies or other print media. I gleaned a few things from the book, but overall it was not what I needed. I think the title is a bit misleading."
5,A superb gift for fire engine enthusiasts,"Written by Ed Hass (a highly experienced specialist historian of firefighting apparatus who has five books and more than 100 published articles to his credit), Crown Firecoach History is a unique, remarkable, informative study of a special line of fire engines first created in 1953. Black-and-white as well as gorgeous color photographs of these historical vehicles, enhance this in-depth history of their service fill this amazing and memorable high-quality hardbound book from beginning to end. Printed on glossy paper, Crown Firecoach History is a superb gift for fire engine enthusiasts and automotive history buffs."
1,It Should Have Been a Lot Better,"This book on the great Crown fire rigs could have been a lot better. How:- many of the photos are out of focus and are of poor quality- the writing text has lots of factual errors- there is a lot of puffery in the writing, and endless referrals toS/Cal musters. Where are useful interviews with Crown users?- missing are (available) cab and chassis photos- where is the discussion of Hall Scott power- vastly too much inane writing on the Crown ownership"
4,A joyous adventure,"I found this jazz CD to be a delightful mixture of straight ahead jazz, vocal arrangements, and ""smooth"" tunes. The music is quite listenable and soothing. It has something for everyone who likes jazz. But the purist might find fault with its commercial appeal; I, for one, just sat back and relished."
5,Sensitive Interpretations of Sondheim's Work- Gorgeous!,"I am a Sondheim-aholic and I love this album. His music provides a perfect framework for these jazz and R&B; greats to make their own.Many of the songs are ""Holy Grail"" to me and I was mildly shocked by Cole & Shorter's version of ""Losing My Mind"". I have grown to love it though, and their version does fit the song's theme.I never tire of listening to this album; have had it for five years and listen at least weekly. A great addition to any jazz and/or Sondheim collection. Glad to have showtune ballads like these presented so beautfully in the jazz idiom."
3,Music & Lyrics,Works best without words. Sondheim's lyrics are badly sung and their meaning undermined. Otherwise fine.
1,Rent before you buy,If you buy this movie you'll know what I mean.If your a Kari Wuhrer fan stick to Poison. There's not enough of her to justify this movie.
1,"So, so bad","What a waste of time! Michael Vartan must have been broke when he took this part because it was just such a bad story. And kind of annoying how he kept asking his father and brothers to leave his house and they kept saying ""no, we can't do that right now""- ugh! Just kick them out! Call the cops! Then Emilio Estevez, in the movie for about 2 minutes, no idea why. Denis Leary is the only one giving this dead movie mouth to mouth to breathe some kind of life into it, something! Overall awful."
2,Sand DVD,"Revenge drama filmed in what appears to be California's Big Sur. Beautiful photography is completely destroyed by the DVD's dreadful pan and scan job (the film's format is obviously 2:35 to 1 Panavision), the kind of thing I thought had gone out the window along with the VHS format. As for the film, the effectiveness of the drama (a study of the violence-prone macho attitudes in our society?) is diminished by the characters' lack of depth, a deadly slow first 45 minutes and a disappointing, not quite believable ending. A good enough time killer, but that's about it."
2,Hey Michael Vartan is in it.,Michael Vartan is my all time favorite actor but even he could not pull this one out of the bag but I did buy it for his sake. You gotta understand its not his fault.
3,Printed only 508 copies!,"The price was right. The quality was good. Butwe only got 508 copies before the cartridgeran out of toner, no way close to what is claimed."
3,One Book Two Covers,"This book is a useful and practical guide, provided you do not already have Sailing Drills by Rick White. Race Training is page for page (except the cover) identical with Sailing Drills. Literally, even the page numbering is the same. Save your money and buy one."
3,doesnt really work well,"I dont think it works well, it just looks and smells horrible, i love the buffering lotion but not the drying lotion, i felt like it caused me to break out more, and turns everything pink that you are in contact with, didnt really dry me out or get rid of pimples, it gave me a even bigger pimple. but the buffering lotion works, especially for oily skin, its so good to wear under makeup, that is worth the money, not this one."
2,Not so great,"I agree with the previous review. It doesn't really work. Plus it's supposed to say on overnight, but if the pimple is anyplace that might touch the pillowcase - forget it. The only thing that's gone when you wake up is the lotion. (and the money you spent on it!)"
1,"Headset is not ""Hands Free""","Unfortunately this is the ONLY headset that will work with this phone. Samsung support told me this was a deliberate design choice on their part and that they put a ""special ring"" around the headset socket to ensure other headsets would not work well (I've tried other headsets and the volume comes through so low as to be unusable). What this means is that if this set doesn't fit your ear very well (mine falls out all the time unless I duct tape it on) you will have to hold it in by hand which is very annoying when driving or your hands aren't free (e.g., in airports while pulling luggage). I would not buy another phone that did not take alternate headsets (and there are many good ones out there)."
1,Nazi Gold??? We have been Robbed !!!,"Well what can I say and be polite?? hmmm.... Hello!! This DVD sucks. I Buy alot of WW2 DVD's, especially anything Nazi and this is the worst i have ever bought!! They spent more time on the cover art than the editing. I had my tv on full blast and could hardly hear what Michael York was saying!! The background sounds and music was so loud it drowned the narration. The film footage looked good though. Nazi Gold?? it wasnt a search at all but more like the history of Nazi's and how they came into power. I thought they were going to search caves and undergrouind Vaults but No!!! very dissapointing, Please dont buy this, there are many other great Nazi films that you can Buy"
5,The Last Half of the Millennium,"Reading Philip Seplow's Overgrown is like holding up a mirror to the last half of the 20th Century. Some parts of the mirror are dusty and others are a bit distorted but readers will be totally engaged by the reflection of social culture presented by Mr. Seplow. The stories include vivid language which bring to life each subject. Name-dropping of rock icons like Jerry Garcia and Paul Simon as well as politicians like Dan Quayle and talk shows hosts such as David Letterman involve the reader in this incisive portrait of contemporary culture. Gentle lessons are learned in each tale and this witty short story collection is a must read for all, especially for those born after 1950!"
5,Profiles the great Mexican muralist,"Alejandro Anreus' Orozco In Gringoland (0-8263-2067-8, ...) profiles the great Mexican muralist and the years he spent in New York, focusing on the major projects done during the period. More general overviews provide casual focus; this in-depth profile is recommended for any who want a more detailed analysis of his works and achievements."
2,"Skim, don't buy.","This book is only useful because there has been so little published recently on Orozco's important work. The book is not fun to read (text needed some serious editing) and the illustrations (in black and white) look like they were scanned from photocopies--worthless. UNM is to be blamed for the terrible production values here. A book to skim, but not own."
1,Did not get the hold I wanted,This product is simply waste of money. It does not work on my son's hair. Will not remmend this to anyone.
5,Loved This Book,I know most people probably were forced to read this for a class and don't have a very high opinion of it but this book is great. I read it for fun. This is what I like to read and rarely do I find books to be as well written and informative as this one. The way Robbins ties everything together really helps put a lot of problems in perspective. I highly recommend this book.
4,WOW!!!,"It's such a great book and it gives you detailed insights. I learned so much, I never knew how serious global issues were until now."
1,don't get fooled !,"Its not a skin flick by any standards! Not worth watching even otherwise. Its a waste of time and money. See the amazon dvd reviews for this, the picture quality problem is also there as in the dvds. (not that better picture quality would have made it worthwhile)"
2,previews deceptive,From the previews and trailers you think this movie is really juicy but it's not. Of 1hr and 30 min approx there's about 2 min of good stuff. The editing literally will show a flash then change to something else. It's frustrating.
2,Faded and washed out picture quality.,Awful looking photography. I did not enjoy watching this film because the picture was so faded. Hopefully they will redo this DVD some day.
3,A Fun Mystery,"This would probably be a good book for someone about 10 to 12 years old. I liked it when I was young. The heroine, Katie, is desperate to earn some money to buy Christmas presents for her family and friends, so she takes a baby-sitting job with a family living on her street. During the course of the evening, she discovers that some of her employer's jewelry is missing. It isn't certain exactly when it disappeared since several strange things happened that evening. The owner of the jewelry doesn't blame her for the theft, but an obnoxious girl who lives nearby starts spreading rumors that Katie is guilty. To save her reputation, Katie sets out to find the missing jewelry and the person who took it."
3,Further adventures of Adam Horne,"After ""The Bombay Marine,"" in which we meet Adam Horne and his band of misfit convicts, ""The War Chest"" takes them on their next adventure.Unfortunately, this book isn't as good; the writing of the sea battles is abbreviated and unengaging. I've given the book three stars, though, because there's a pretty good plot twist in the middle of the book. Too bad Porter Hill doesn't do more with it.As it is, Horne & Company are sent on a secret mission to intercept a French ship and capture a supposed treasure chest. Or are they? Luckily, this book is pretty short, so the shortcomings of the narrative are blown by pretty quickly."
2,Belts are hard to make,"I got this kit a few months ago. We tried to make the belts once, but it was pretty hard and my 8yo got bored and discouraged quickly, she hasn't been interested in it since."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Wrong Information,"Just glanced through pages on Asia; it is showing Kashmir as a seperate country.Surprisingly, the authers seems are unaware that Kashmir is integral part of India."
4,The most pivotal moment in american history?,This book lives up to its series title. The Treaty of 1763 was the start of the American nation. The fall out of the treaty created several events that would lead to the revolution. From rising taxes to the Proclamation of 1763 the colonists were being given ample reasons to rise up. Calloway who is a Native American historian focuses on the rise of the Indians especially Pontiac's rebellion near Detroit. He provides a condemnation of Francis Parkman who virtually ignores the Indians in his account of the 7 years war. Overall if you are looking for a book that explains why the American Revolution began this is an excellent place to start and arguably the most pivotal moment in our history as it started the creation of the United States.
2,Not really a worthwhile read...,"I've read a good deal on the American Revolution, but not much on the French and Indian War. I read the cover and thought the thing would be a good way to fill in some holes on my reading, especially since it was on sale. The book was not unpleasant, but I'm at something of a loss to describe my reaction to the book. The thing seemed mostly to be a disjointed, meandering series of anecdotes. Or was it that there was no greater theme than the very high level points I already knew? The book advertised itself as a discussion with emphasis on the Indians -- but that was done from a Eurocentric viewpoint. Still it was not an unpleasant, relatively quick read."
3,No bad if you want a survey,"Perhaps I'm just used to 600 page books that milk the life out of their subject, but at just 170-some pages this book that charts out all of the consequences of the peace agreement ending the Seven Years War (French and Indian War in America)seemed thin to me. I am reminded of one of those thin books I read as a history major back in the 70's that was intended to give a quick survey of a historical epoch, like the orgins of World War I or the Industrial Revolution in England. It's not bad if you know nothing about the subject, but it's an appetizer not a full meal."
3,Deriviative Story,"This book may be well written but is essentially deriviative of prior work by Francis Jennings and Rene Chartrand, both of whom many years ago identified the last War of Conquest of the English against the French in America and Canda as the necessary cause of the American Revolution. Jennings' Empire of Fortune lays it all out very nicely, though not in a well written format. But there is no harm in telling the story again."
4,A basic historical book about an important event,"The Scratch of a Pen is certainly a worthwhile read. Short, only 171 pages of text, Scratch of a Pen does a great job of laying out how the events of 1763 had far reaching consequences that no one alive at the time could have predicted. Britain was the big winner at the end of the French and Indian War, but ended up ruining future control of the continent by over taxing the inhabitants. In the end the native Americans that fought with Britain ended up doing no better than did those who opposed the English.The whole period serves as an example of ""unintended consequences""...how even the smallest outcome can snowball in the future.Calloway does a masterful job at relating the events of 1763 and much more. Researched by someone who loves to do research but is also a good writer, Calloway manages to convey the full impact of 1763.I can't criticize because of the brevity of the work. It does what its supposed to do."
3,Foam Factory,This product was and is alot of fun for my children and their friends.Ilove how it uses baby shampoo so it wont burn their eyes. On the negative side the plastic tube that sits in the tank tends to rise to the top ofthe container so you have to shake the machine alot to get it to go downor take it apart and push it back down.
3,"Sadly on the thin, filmy side...","I was disappointed when I received my 4 smiley flags. From the photograph, they look like a decent weight canvas sort of flag. But they're really thin and filmy. Almost see-through. I had a local seamstress reinforce the grommets because they're basically being supported by a doubled-over piece of the filmy fabric. It's been a month and I just traded them out for other flags, and I have to say that they don't seem to have faded like I worried, so that part is good. They totaled like $5.50 after shipping, each. So I believe the old adage applies...you get what you pay for."
5,Perfect,"This is awesome.The Happy Face Flag was exactly what I was looking for, and I was very happy with the product. Exactly what I was thinking of when I ordered it. It arrived in a timely manner and had absolute no damage.Thanks!"
5,Happy Face for the beach,I was paying about $40 for each flag and had decided it was a luxury that I could live without before finding them here for $9! What a bargain for the same flag!
2,Its okay,Its okay but there is other CD's that are better like the one Ry Cooder did with this type of music. I am not listening to it that much
3,mambo,"arrived as expected. packaged was fine, and it was as the description sated. it smells okay it is not overwhelming"
1,Never Recieved,"I ordered two books on Amazon and only received ONE of them, the one being the incorrect book. I was not given the proper information to remedy this and was hoping that upon receiving the other book I would know who to return the first book to...I never received the other book. I paid $17 in total and only got one book. It was a children's book on ancient Rome, not the textbook I had purchased."
2,Powerlifting Chain Collars lacking luster,"Unfortunately, the collars were machined quite poorly. I workout and train clients at a gym with various types of olympic bars and the ""IF"" the collars fit on a bar at all, they were very snug if they did. The screw to secure the collars to the bar are almost completely ineffective. As I mentioned earlier, the collars already fit so snug there was hardly any need for tightening. Also, the collars were not thick enough for the screw to take a good hold. One turn to loosen them and they would fall off. This problem could have been easily remedied with an attachment / weld of a thicker nut over the hole on the collar (you're welcome). Without it the screws barely stays on. Last but not least, it would have been nice if the bolt and nut that secured the chain were replaced with an easier / efficient ""quick pin"" of some sort. Some of us like to change out different chain sizes. Thank's for reading."
5,Great training aid,"I am a personal trainer and got these collars to help my power lifting clients overcome plateaus in their lifts. These collars can be used in almost all lifts involving the barbell. The collars will fit both the one inch and Olympic size bars. They accommodate different size chain links from small to very large, so can help a new lifter, as well as, the advanced in almost all exercises using the barbell. I have 'made do' with home made chain attachment solutions in the past, but find these easier to use and I am more certain that the weight is equal on both sides of the bar."
3,Okinawan music goes drum'n'bass,"This album creates a unique sound by taking samples of music from the Okinawa area of Japan and mixing them with dance beats...of sorts. I think it's known as ""drum and bass"" beats--a lot of activity, but not exactly something I can dance to. At any rate, it's cool to hear this mixture of Okinawan island sounds with western beat."
5,a date to remember,"You're hopelessly seduced from the opening track ""Tonight You Belong To Me"" (Patience and Prudence) - ""the first record I ever shoplifted"". From there on it's just a matter of when John will pop the question. But he's not easy - and he makes sure the mood is set just right.All these tracks are in pristine condition and the compilation is arranged and produced to perfection. Anyone who has tried their hand at mix tapes will swoon at John's informed skill and remarkable taste.I bought the CD just for ""Jet Boy Jet Girl"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" and ""Johnny Are You Queer?"" - but every other song here is a true gem. I am exuberantly happy with this purchase.The music is enhanced by the liner notes in which John guides us through his planned evening of romantic bliss - and respects us enough to leave us with a beautiful song for the morning after (""Bewildered"").For all of us who will never be fortunate enough to date John Waters in person, this is the next best thing."
5,still the king!!,"the album is supurb for any john waters fan and even if your not a fan you'll find his taste in music is fanastic if his movies don't make you a fan then this will. there is a song for eveyone in this great valentines day album, i frankly think it's a perfect valentines day gift for your best friend, lover, or mybe even yourself. i loved it!! as always mr. john waters pulls through again."
5,Outstanding Saw,I have put hundreds of hours behind this saw and enjoy using it every time. I am a machine design engineer and I am impressed with the performance of this saw. One of my best all time tool purchases. Make sure you get the contractor and not the contractor II sold at Lowes etc.
5,You Will Conform!,"After world war II the goverenment was very, very afraid that people would start thinking for themselves and question authority. They were so terrified, in fact, that they made a bunch of movies about how much fun it is to conform and do what you are told to do.The result is this collection of films aimed at teaching you to work hard, spend money and have the nicest lawn the block.No wonder the hippies eventually started doing acid and said ""to heck"" with everything that was going on.These movies, at some level, tell people that they should be happy slave people, as long as they are slaves to capitalism and not communism.In this orwellian world, the grass is always greener if you fly the red, white and blue.Ths historical importance of these films can not be overstated, because they show you just how dangerous our leaders can be."
5,"Great insight in all things French, psyche (culture, history, and government)","This book really delves into why the French are the way they are, as cliche as it sounds. The authors do a great job in explaining how French history has shaped the psyche of the people and the government of today. I am still reading this, so I'll probably have more to say once I'm done. I am totally dumbfounded by the all encompassing power the State (French government) has over its people. All roads run to Paris, literally, kind of like how the Arc de Triomphe is situated. I've always had many questions about the French culture, that my French husband has never been able to adequately answer and this book does the trick!"
5,Enjoy it !!!,I brought this book randomly and didn't expect much from it. Surprisingly I couldn't let it down once I started to read it. I love the way it was written objectively and really get you know about the France. I would buy other books from these writers in the future.
1,Pas pour moi,"I was disappointed by this book. It is predicated on the assumption that the USA is `right' and that France, au contraire, is `wrong'. It makes many references to an Anglo-American view of the world, but British readers will have little sympathy with the authors' advocacy of federalism and will see little difference between the incapacity of local government in the UK and in France.The chapters on French history and the education system are interesting but not original.There are several howlers in the book. For example France has no active volcanoes, Norway is not a member of the European Union and it's preposterous to claim that `In Britain, all doctors are civil servants'.To be fair, the authors occasionally concede that a lot of what France stands for makes sense, but ultimately this book is a justification for the prejudices of North Americans, written for a US audience and funded by a US trust."
4,This book helped me understand French Bureaucracy !,"I've always been a Francophile. Maybe because of my first name being French, Paul McCartney wrote a song about it with French phrases. So I took French in high school...and many years later, wound up living several months a year there. So, this book helped me understand how the French think, their culture, and how their history has shaped their lives. For example, the decentralization/centralization explanation helps me whenever I face French Bureaucracy. This is a must-read for someone planning any length of visit to France."
3,A fair effort but different than expected.,"The book is broken into three main sections, Spirit, Structure and Change. I found the section on spirit very perceptive, if the whole book had been like this then I would have given five stars, However I found the latter two sections, particularly the section on Structure rather boring and although they do contribute to the French identity I think their role was over stated in this book. I was also expecting a bit on French attitudes to drinking and smoking, after all that was mentioned on theback of the book. Recommended if you want to learn a bit about the way the country is structured and have an interest in French politics. If you want a book on the French themselves you're best to look elsewhere."
4,60 Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong....,"What a delightful book. Very well written in a conversational style, it offers wonderful insight into why the French are so...well, FRENCH. The book explains French culture, history, society and customs - both as a country and a player on the global stage. It's very educational without being dry. ""60 Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong..."" is a great read. 4/5 stars. Thanks for reading."
2,Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong,"This book was recommended to me by an American friend who lives in Paris. I am not French but I am not American either. To me, the book is far more of an expose of how two people from a very ethno-centric country (the United States)see other cultures and, surprise, discovers people who have had different experiences do not think, behave or believe the way they do. Wow.PS I love France and the French."
1,Provincial Notes,"As a Canadian who has lived in California for many years, I find this apology for the French amateurish, provincial, and superficial. The differences between continents are considerable, especially so from a Left Coast perspective. These authors, new to France as they undertook this book, never fail to take a shot at the States, while always appearing to maintain a ""North American"" perspective (funded by a grant institute in New Hampshire). It is unfortunate that the authors are not, by their own admission, well-traveled in the States either, as their sneers appear to be informed by a moral superiority many fellow Canadians find quite embarrassing. The attitude betrayed is that mired in Canadian politics, after all."
2,Having French friends does not make you and Anthropologist,"""Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong"" is a moderately interesting book on the social differences of the French for an American point of view. The authors Nadeau and Barlow look into French culture, history, socialism,and economy but are not very analytical in their study of the French lifestyle. Would not be especially useful as a scholarly reference book, but good for one who is generally interested in French customs."
1,"Not Funny, a serious book","I had just read A Year in the Merde and loved it. My husband and I go to France very year, love everything about it, especially the differences between the U.S. and France. So many of the customs are unexplainable to us, one being that whenever we go to anyplace in France, we expect it to be closed. The hours the stores keep I cannot figure out, and the hours of the restaurants vary also. We see a sign that says(in French) open all the days, we go the next day and the place is FERME(closed). A Year in the Merde points out so many differences, I just laughed and laughed, as none are serious, just something you must deal with.We were told that 60 Million Frenchmen was also a very funny book. It is not. Not one bit. Do not buy it if you are looking for something light."
4,Un bon livre,"This year in my French 4 class, we had to read most of the chapters from this book. It actually turned out to be very interesting rather than a chore though! If you want to know exactly why the French are French, this is a pretty accurate book. There are some generalizations as with any book on such a large topic would have to have. Also, two actual teachers from France came to my class and we asked them questions specifically from this book and some things were less than true at least for the two of them. However, this book is about the experiences of the two authors, so don't let that discourage you. If you want to learn more about the culture of the French, this book will do the job. You could always travel there and find out for yourself as well!"
1,Complete nonsense,"I'm a transplanted Canadian who has been living in Paris for the past five years. Thrilled to find a book about France and its sometimes baffling ways written by my compatriots, I bought it instantly, but I must say, I have never been more disappointed in a book purchase. This work is rife with glaring inaccuracies, sweeping generalities and even spelling mistakes! Seemingly basing their work on their own unsubstantiated observations rather than on any real journalistic research, Barlow and Nadeau lead their readers by the nose down a path of falsehoods that leave uninitiated francophiles believing that France and its people can be summed up so contritely, and the rest of us wondering ""What Fantasy-land France are they talking about?""."
3,interesting,"I am French, living in the US, and I thought this book was interesting and helped me understand differences between French and American cultures. Of course, certain facts exposed seem kind of irrelevant because they are more stereotypes than anything but, knowing both cultures a lot of the information is pretty accurate. I would recommand this book."
3,Thorough. Very thorough.,"Well-written, long, thorough. Thorough, can't stress that enough. I was hoping for a style as lively as the title, but that was not to be."
4,You need this book,"Everyone moving to France should buy this book. It is such an entertaining read,it is a is a real insight into Anglo/French relationships. Some parts you do have to take with a pinch of salt, so do not take the book too seriously. But I did come away with a better understanding about the French and France.Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France but Not the French"
3,Useful info about France and the French,Lots of useful info about France and the French. Key info for me: French rudeness; French history especially during WWII; education in France.
4,A good movie but not really a sequel,"NBD 2 is a good movie, but not really a sequel to the first Never Back Down. Aside from a couple of scenes referenced from the first movie, the only character that is the same is Max, who plays a small role. It has a similar feel to the first movie however. A few troubled kids who find a mentor in a martial arts expert. I personally thought that this movie was definitely worth watching. If you really liked the first movie I definitely think you should take the time to watch this one as well. I personally really enjoyed watching both of them."
2,Not good.,"Dont bother paying for this as it simply is nothing like the first one. Bad acting, a couple decent fights, bad plot, not even a attractive blond romantic interest or beleiveable villan."
3,Not too good,Not one who usually bashes movies. But people were right about the plot and character development being weak. The fights were ok not the greatest but pretty good considering it was a low budget movie.
4,its ok,first one was better. nafnefnaeoifLFKMEIOFA LENA IE OF AOEIWJ AEJEW JALK LAKFLKW FLKWK LK ALKEWLK LAK LK ALK LK LKA
2,This cd came up short on the songs of Nat Cole,"For this project the strings played a tribute to Nat Cole. What a great idea. The main problem here with a project such as this is to identify what songs to record. The producer made his choice, but i'm rather disappointed in his decision. There are a lot of better songs that could have been used for this project. To name a few let's start with ""For Sentimental Reasons"", ""L-O-V-E"", ""Route 66"", et al.The stings gave a good performance on this cd. Their arrangements, I thought, were up to par. If we could have just had that better song selection, then this cd would have been one of my all time favorites.I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
3,Great for non-Latinos.......,"The author is a white American Hispanicist and the father of two Anglo-Latino sons. Fox says a lot of great things here. This book was really informative for me. However, I am not Latino. If I were, I think I might be bored to tears by this book. For example, Fox discusses the type of Spanish that is spoken on the Spanish stations in the US. As a non-viewer, I didn't know those things and found his analysis interesting. But if I were an avid Spanish-language TV viewer, he would just be preaching to the crowd. Books that are deeper and will keep more Latino readers interested are Fusco's ""English is Broken Here"" and Gonzalez's ""Muy Macho."""
2,Emil Pascarelli's book remains the primary work on RSI.,"Ms. Quilter's book is good when it comes to advice on selecting a doctor and therapist, and also dealing with the guilt and depression associated with RSI. But I found it enormously lacking in not only the causes of RSI, but of what the specific injuries are and how you can recognize them. Emil Pascarelli's work, even though it is now five years old, remains the No. 1 source guide for anyone who has RSI."
5,this guy is amazing,"This recording is great. The sound is vintage but clear and perfectly executed. The guy appears with a pipe like playing so easy,and surely it is."
3,Samsonite Converter,"I purchased this item for some European guests to use while visiting my home. They used it to charge cell phones and an electric shaver. After the first day of use the fuse inside the converter blew and had to be replaced. Samsonite provides two spare fuses. I was disappointed it blew the fuse as the appliances were well within the 50W limit of this converter. It worked fine for the rest of their visit so maybe it was just a bad fuse to begin with. Overall I'm pleased with it, but only give it an average rating due to the fuse issue."
4,Samsonite 50 w 110/220 Conerter,"This a very useful bit of kit if you are travelling in America or Hawaii. I have it connected through an adaptor to a fused five point British power block enabling me to charge my i-pad, i-phone, mobile broadband modem, razor and toothbrush simultaneously without exceeding the rating. Only problem is the recommended maximum usage time of 30 mins. I did exceed this but the unit did get very warm and I would not recommend leaving it unattended or when sleeping at night."
1,very disappointed,"Samsonite 50 Watt 110/120 V to 220/240 V ConverterI just purchased this converter to use with a curling iron (50 W) that I just bought while in Germany. When the converter arrived, I plugged it in with the iron, and the light came on indicating it was working. I threw the box away. I tried to use it the next day, and it didn't work at all. I tried it in different outlets all over my house, but it just doesn't work. There doesn't seem to be a way to reach the seller, as I would like to return it (even though I don't have the original packaging) and get a full refund. this has been a bad experience and at this point, I wouldn't buy anything from this seller again."
5,1- 2 KO,"Pure Howard. Dream Man is creepy and chilling while managing to create a really charismatic couple. If you've ever fantasized about being the damsel in distress who rescues herself with the help of a slightly tarnished, well-muscled knight- Dream Man is for you. Just keep your lights on. After the Night starts out slowly with lots of background information that's important later on, but still ponderous. This one seems to want to be a thriller with good sex and only the sex part really works. The hero is VERY well-endow... uh, I mean, well-rounded, but I could have used a heroine who was a little less easy. She was more of a spitting kitten than the actual lioness needed by the hero. This is Howard at her sexiest, however, and the love/sex scenes are some of the best around."
1,Very misleading,"I was so excited to see Linda Howard had a new book out that I rushed to the nearest bookstore to buy it. Only when I had it in my hands did I realize it was of two of her other books. I am sorry for the 1 star rating because the stories are GREAT, but I hate the deception. I am still waiting for Chance MacKenzie's story."
5,Enlightening Path,"I LOVE this book. The direction and explanation of the Four Insights are multi-layered and clearly put. Powerful exercises are included, and are worth their weight in gold as they train the sub-conscious to a unique and enlightening perspective. As we practice our ability to know and experience these universal insights, our inner world heals, and the outer world follows. Many thanks to the author who took the time to share his wisdom."
3,The Four Insights,"I found the introduction to be the most interesting and informative section of the book. The facts of the Laika shamans coming out of seclusion and the cover ups of the conquistadors are fascinating. Throughout the book, the author continually refers to shifting perceptions between levels of serpent, jaguar, hummingbird, and eagle which I found a little convoluted. The insights are valuable though and include the practices of nonjudgement, beauty, nondoing, certainty, living consequently, and owning your projections. Villoldo's personal accounts throughout the book are entertaining."
3,Just ok,"I have been involved in the Four Winds shamanic work for a couple of years (led by Alberto V). It has been wonderfully helpful and has grounded me in a way that no other system has. It is like living 24/7 in sacred space. Yet, this book is not that strongly written and a bit boring. I can highly recommend getting the shamanic rites and the Four Winds Society work but cannot highly recommend this book."
1,FRAUD?,"Sorry but this book must be for people who have never been and will never go to Peru. Laika Shamans are known by EVERYONE in Cuzco and all over the Andes as the worst sort of Black Magicians, spiritual mercenaries who perform any kind of magic without any type of ethics for the right price. Who are you trying to fool Mr. Villoldo? But let's face it, this is from someone who wrote a whole book about the non-existent ""Inca Medicine Wheel."" How about a little ethics here? Why steal a beautiful Native North American tradition and put Andean Decorations on it and call itthe Inca....Honestly!"
5,Alberto Villoldo does a Exceptional Job,"As always, Alberto Villoldo has done an exceptional job writing The Four Insights. Well written, easy to follow exercizes in Shamanic Healing that if practiced properly, do work. Alberto Villoldo is one of the most talented Shamans in Western Society, and he has provided in his books, healing methods used long before the industrial world began. I recommend this book for everyone, especially those interested in self-improvement, or those who just seem to have bad luck. Try this, I did, and I went from facing Life in Prison, to now, becoming a Shaman myself, living a Life of Happiness & Abundance. Alberto Villoldo is a Great Teacher & Mentor. Fantastic Book!!!!"
4,cheap but doesn't look it,I received this item today.I was really impressed by how well it was packaged.It took me maybe 45 minutes to assemble it.All the parts were there and the assembly drawings were easy to follow.As i said it wasn't high priced but it works perfect for my situation.
5,All About the Moon,"My 4 year old son knows this video by heart and often asks to go the library to check it out - again. He can explain the concepts presented and likes to play the moon and sun game. So on his behalf, I give this video a 5 stars rating."
3,Learn from History,"Louis Gossett, Jr. is the star of Carolina Skeletons and gives his usual excellent performance as a man returning to his small South Carolina town in 1964 who is asked by his dying mother to prove that his older brother executed thirty years previous was wrongly accused. Carolina Skeletons is a made-for-television movie that is somewhat lacking in some of the production values of more expensively produced films. It has several scenes that come to a dramatic climax and then fade to black. I found myself expecting commercials. The movie is worthy of attention because it reminds us of the unjust treatment of African Americans in our country - especially in the South. As citizens, we must always be aware of injustice in order that it be identified and vanquished."
1,No response from seller for defective DVD,"This DVD is defective, it freezes and blacks out in various places. I did all the trouble-shooting described and when that didn't work, I emailed the seller a courteous email about the problem. I received no response whatsoever. I will never buy from this seller again...I am very unhappy with this product."
2,A Bit Disappointed,This movie disturbed me a bit. I knew what is was gonna be about but executing a little boy for two brutal murders that only a man could have pulled off just doesn't make any sense. Especially when the movie doesn't even show how they came to accuse the little boy. It's not worth buying.
4,A good book,I liked the Amanda Ashley and Christine Feehan Stories in the book as I love the Dark series books and look forward to reading more about Carpathians. The Amanda Ashley story was good as well they are really the only reason I bought the book. If you just read the two stories it is worth the price.
5,Christine Feehan Fan - Carpathian Series,"I love the Carpathian series from Christine Feehan. But I was a litlle dismayed when I bought the anthology ""Dark Dreamers"", then ordered the ""After Twilight"" anthology from Amazon, and it turned out the CF short stories were the same."
3,After Twilight,"As a fan of supernatural fiction, and devotee of Christine Feehan's ""Dark"" Series, I couldn't pass up the inclusion of another of her tortured soul's emergence into the light via his soulmate. As for Amanda Ashley and Ronda Thompson, their stories were enjoyable, but I'm not sure I'll look out for individual paperbacks."
4,Feehan does it again.,This book is interesting in that it highlights the ancients that were sent out before the time period of the other books.
3,Just needed more,"Ok, let me state I have really enjoyed all of Christine Feehan's books and Amanda Ashley's too. I was however disapointed in all of the ladies with this installment. I read the genre a great deal am I am getting tired of the stereotypical tortured monster. I think they should all just lighten up and have a character that likes who and what he is and doesn't say sorry to anyone for it. That is not what happened here. Feehan's story of course was different. I enjoyed getting background but this would have been better as a book, there needed to be more ""meat"" on the story's bones so t speak.For a halloween book I sadly did not get the creeps or swept away once. I am glad I have the book for the slight bit of backround it provides Feehan's Carpathian series but other than that, tell the werewolf to keep some sheep to eat and tell the vampire to have a long talk with a good therapist."
1,Very dissapointed.,I love Chritine Feehans dark series. But this book Dark dream was so dissapointing it made me want to gag! I felt the charachters and storyline were very flat and had no real passion. Granted this was a short book but I was still extremly dissapointed. At some points during the book I just wanted the charcters to shut up they kept ranting on and on about their fellings but I didn't feel any of their emotion unlike Christine's previous books. I think if this story was made into a book with more meat on it then perhaps it might have been better. I did enjoy the background information about carpathian life but otherwise this book was indeed Cristine's worst piece of work.
4,Comprehensive but boring,"This is a comprehensive study of Portuguese literature up to around 1920. It says nothing about Fernando Pessoa. It is as boring as a textbook. Bell deals with every possible aspect of the subject, and presumably actually read most or even all of what he discusses. It was his thankless task to introduce English-speaking people to a literature which was substantially unknown to them, and to write the book just before the greatest Portuguese writer, Pessoa, came to public attention."
1,Not pleased at all,"The item did not fit and that's fine, it happens...but there was no invoice in the packet so it will be difficult to return."
1,Not happy with this product,"There are several problems with this camisole. As a Yoga teacher Im always looking for Yoga tops and hoped this might work out. It won't. The material is thin with virtually no support. I like being held in not only the obvious breast area but all over when I'm working, this top will not do at all. I'm only 5'3"" and this camisole is very short on me (just below the navel) and being short I always prefer the shorter style camisole but not this one. My biggest frustration is that I was following a link for ""shelf bra camisole"" and this came up so I was VERY surprised when it arrived and had no built in bra. I kept it because it was inexpensive and I didn't want to spend more money on the return. The only thing this will be good for is lounging around the house."
1,sizing lousy,"I ordered XXL. The item that arrived SAID that it was a 2xL but no way! Perhaps if you are a size 12 or less, this size might fit. Good luck. I sent it back, and do not plan to order from this vendor again."
2,Large way too small for Size 6,"These are very well-made camis, however the other reviews are right about the sizing being way off. I wear a size 6, sometimes a 4. My other camis (made by esprit) are medium and fit beautifully. After reading the reviews, I decided to play it safe and order a large. When I put it on it was so tight I could barely breathe and fit more like and extra small."
2,shelf bra,these were well made but so very small. I gave them to my daughter who is about a size 6 and they were even too small for her. She gave them to her daughter who is about a size 0. I ordered and received an x-large. Hmmm. Not pleased at all. Sorry.
3,bella camisole,"I purchased this so I could wear it under shirts for the summer.If you purchase one of these, be aware that they are not a long shirt.Don't know if I'd buy another one of these. I would rather see something before I buy it."
3,Good quality but run very small.,I'm happy with these camis but I'm usually between a small and a medium and this large is a snug fit.
3,Runs small and long,"I've been trying for ages to find a replacement for the perfect cami I had several years ago. This runs longer and more snug than I would like, but I really need a navy cami, so I'm keeping it, even though I'm not completely happy. I am only 5""1"" and this covers my butt, but I've found most camis made now run this longer length. We petite women lose out, it seems :( This also runs small - I usually wear a large, and this was XX-large and fits very snug. Order up from your regular size!"
1,Sizing is terrible!,"I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this item. The sizing isn't right at all; the product runs at least 3 sizes too small, if not more. I bought a 2x, because I normally wear a large and wanted it to be big and loose, and it felt like I had tried to squeeze myself into a small or medium. Buyer beware!"
2,Beware!,"I purchased four of these tops. I sent all four back to exchange for a larger size.I normally buy these sorts of tops in a medium...well, this manufacturer has a messed up idea of medium because even the extra large is a bit too snug.However, the material and construction of these tops is phenomenal but the sizing is off.If you decide to purchase one or more of these be sure to get them AT LEAST a size larger than what you normally purchase."
1,Very disappointed,"The material was nice and the color red was perfect, but the band on the shelf bra was so tight I couldn't get the camisole over my bust."
1,"Oh, dear!","This comes in a 2x, with a built in bra, so I bought it. Oh, dear! It is skin tight, maybe even tighter than my skin and the bra is laughable. Or it might be if it weren't such a horrifying sight. If you're really skinny, go ahead and get this, but otherwise you should probably pass."
3,Tight fit,I ordered the 2X size for my wife. It fit her skin tight. She wanted a fit that was less snug. It would work fine as an under shirt or under a see thru blouse. The quality was fine. Shipping was quick.
2,Sizes Off,"While the material is very comfortable on the skin, the size is not. This camisole seems to run a size below the tag. The large is really a medium, when up against several comparable products I own."
4,SEE KIM YATES DO A STRIPPER DANCE,"An excellent soft core plot driven film with Ms. Gain as a detective.For me, the best part was seeing the soft core star Kim Yates do an exotic dancer routine."
3,Just okay. Forgets too often what kind of movie it is.,"This is a softcore movie that forgets too often that it's just that, and nothing more. The story is laughably predictable and unoriginal. Now that's nothing new. The stories for all softcore movies are like that. But the really stellar ones know that, and just use the story to transition between and build up to numerous, hot sex scenes.So what do you end up getting? There are only three sex scenes in this video, which is about six less than there should be. All are boy/girl, and the girls involved are Shauna O'Brien, CeCe Tsou, and Nicole Gian. A lot of the story takes place in a strip club, or involves strippers, so there is still a lot of skin on display during the rest of the video.But overall, this was a disappointment. There is much better stuff than this available."
5,Great Saw,"This is my first table saw purchase for my home workshop and I couldn't be happier. Everything arrived in great shape. Took about 4 hours to get setup and aligned. Plenty of power, cuts like a dream. No complaints at all."
5,Bring it back,"I was just in our local ACME electric store yesterday and they had one of these American made Contractor's table saws on the showroom floor. It was really refreshing to see a Contractor's table saw that has a made in America sticker on it. I think that Delta would bring back it's reputation and sell more saws if they kept makeing the saws here. As far as the one complaint here about the the lack of a dust port on this saw, I have the answer, and built a very efficient dust hood like no other for underneith that will fit this saw."
3,"Mixed bag, but one stands out...","THis was an astounding and uplifting movie. I first saw it at home and when Tim Robbins' character finally gets the record player and then broadcasts Sull'Aria from Marriage of Figaro it brought me to tears. The piece of music, which I was not familiar with since I generally detest Opera, tied with the scene and its redemptive character, is one of the most moving things I'v ever experienced. It is one of the most beautiful melodies ever. So I bought the disk and I've practically worn it out on that track. And also the old Hank Williams and Inkspots stuff, great stuff. SOme of the rest of it is hard to listen to without the accompaniament of the movie."
5,Powerful!,"I have about 40 movie soundtracks, and this one is by far the best of them all. The movie is indeed brilliant as well. I cannot say enough about the beauty of the way the string base is utilized in many of the pieces on this soundtrack. For example ""Shawshank Redemption"" (track 11) nearly blows my speakers if I turn it up too high. Also, track 19, has some beautiful base sequences...this is a masterpiece! It should definitely rank among the best of all time."
4,Shawshank Redemption Review,"Loved the movie and now I have the soundtrack to remember the parts of the movie I liked best-like when the ""italian ladies sing""."
2,Decent,If your a fan of Newman I am sure you will enjoy this. Personally none of the themes really stand out for me. Of this work I found little of it to be remarkable.
1,Would help if i had recieved my PURCHASE,"I would love to review ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but to date (over 3 weeks) i have not recieved it yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Bittersweet in the greatest way.,"Warm, and at times chilling - it exudes a wonderful array of emotions.I've always loved Thomas Newman - this is one of his greatest pieces :)"
4,Powerful Music from a Classic Film,"As a big collector of movie scores, this is definitely a must-own for those who love film music. I believe that one of the reasons that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has become such a popular and beloved film is because of the memorable music. Two tracks stand out as my favorites - the Shawshank Prison theme (Tr. 2) and End Titles (Tr. 21). The overall score seems a bit sad and depressing, but that's one of the things that makes it stand apart from other movie scores. This CD also includes a few actual songs with lyrics as well as the opera music that is briefly featured in the film.The four stars is because the score has a few weak tracks. Also, those like me who care about the insert pages and the artwork/design on the disc face - the Shawshank CD has nothing special. But the overall score as a whole is great. The composer is Thomas Newman. Two other scores I also highly recommend from Newman areRoad to PerditionandRevolutionary Road."
4,Shawshank Sountrack,"I always loved the movie, and the soundtrack is no dissapointment, quality wise the soundtrack is quite good. If you liked the music to the movie then this is a good purchase."
3,Still trying it out will reply again later,"My 8 year old daughter said this cd helped her to sleep better and she likes it.. My 11 year old son, who we bought it for in the first place, did not want to use it intitially. I ""made"" him use it and he said he was not able to relax.. so We have a mixed review at this point. I will have them try it for a week and do another review."
2,Assembly Quality issues SR200 Rack,"I purchased 5 of these racks and the quality of the product was absolutely pathetic. I was only able to assemble 4 shelves as two of the cartons were short 4 of the short beams for the ends. The enclosed beams had burrs and bends on the end of the tabs making it necessary to grind each tab on a grinder to make it fit into the corresponding slot. I estimate it took an extra 3 hours to assemble the 4 units due to the poor fitting and grinding.So if you have nothing better to do some day, get yourself a grinder, hammer, screwdriver, spray paint and a lot of patience and spend the day assembling one of these units. The completed units are sturdy and look nice but getting there is one heck of a job. The finished product is a 4, the parts to assemble the unit rate a ""0"" for a 2 star average. Never again!!"
2,Cheaper than others for a reason,"Box Came broken, missing a few pieces needed to hold the upper rack together and some of the particleboard selfs we're broken at the corners. They serve their purpose but know what you are getting."
3,Thought it would be more informing...,"This book was too psychological and not political enough, for me anyway. I felt that the same 2 or 3 concepts were being repeated by different stories throughout the entire book. Got the point across."
4,good cup for protection,cup is light but i cut the foam lining to make it better. wear it for baseball and softball summer months so it needed to vent better. fits different straps.
2,Buyer Beware!,"This book is only good for overall knowledge of small towns in Vermont; every little town gets a small paragraph's worth of description. It is not very helpful if you are looking to visit and need more practical information such as where to stay, where to eat, and things to do. While it does list some lodging and restaurants, it is by no means comprehensive and you're left to do most of the leg work yourself. This book, in my opinion, was a waste of my money - I had to buy two more Vermont books to get the information I was looking for. Even the town descriptions are too short to be really helpful. This is more of an ""Overview of the Splendor of Vermont"" book."
2,Another diappointment,"Just as in the behind the scenes Narnia book, I expected that this book would contain the story with illustrations from the movie suitable for reading to my grandchildren. Instead, it seemed to be promotional material for the movie."
4,Better Than I Expected,"I purchased this book at the bargain price, and paid less than $5. Not being much of a Narnia fan, I bought it out of curiosity and didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of detail and the wealth of information contained within this book. For that, I give it four stars - but to the Narnia fan it is probably a five-star book.The book has a lot of pictures - some production photos, some conceptual artwork, and some stills from the movie. There is an abundance of reading material. Topics include the creation of the costumes, creatures, and the special effects. Also included is a diary by actress Anna Popplewell (who plays one of the Pevensie children), which serves as a journal of her on-set experiences. My favorite feature was the interview with director Andrew Adamson. He answers a variety of questions, ranging from the casting process to the logistics of large-scale filmmaking."
4,Competent,"This book did the job for which I bought it i.e to cover the complete life of Philip & thus provide more knowledge & understanding of the Spanish Ride to its Abyss in the 16th Century. I have passed it to my Russian daughter-in-law accordingly. She,a keen Roman Catholic,while generally highly knowledgeable said she knew little about Spain & felt the impact of the Inquisition has been exaggerated. I disagree & this book substantiated my point. Philip accepted the Inquisition to govern Spain. Other counties both Protestant & Catholic perpetrated ghastly deeds against dissidents but with them it was Politics utilising Religion,not Religion managing the State."
2,The Philip Whitewash,"All that work, and out comes an apologia. No word, really, how the Habsburgs got to take over Spain. About the incredible inbreeding, including Philip's marriage to his niece, Anna of Ausrria, that needed papal dispensation. No indication that Don Carlos was a true schizophrenic, an inheritance from the daughter of Fedinand and Isabella and passed on in the Habsburg family for a few more centuries. The inquisition was a necessity, and the destruction of the armada an act of God? No matter how hard the author tries, Philip still comes across as a hesitant, pencilpushing pedant who was none too bright. Mr. Kamen should have studied Ludwig Pfandl's 1938 book; it descibes Philip correctly and encompassing from all sides. Illustrations: After talking time and time again about Philip's portrait by Titian - why does he not include it? As a historical study, this book is not adequate."
4,"Great, detailed information, with excellent pictures","Horler's Original Sprite and Midget has to be the most thorough, in-depth look at these great little sports cars. I read and enjoyed the book before I owned my Sprite. Now that I am restoring one, the book is even more valuable to me.If you are looking for a book that tells the history and folklore of the Sprite, this may not be your book. (Though Horler's brief history is very well written.)"
4,A good guide for restorers,"The photos are helpfull and the color codes and information on production dates is invaluable. The one thing I wish there were more of, was more pictures and perhaps information on arkley, lenham, speedwell, and spitznel which were companies involved with racing that modified the body shape and tuned the cars for higher performance. They did at least discuss the innocenti. Apart from that I must admit I have read and reread the section on the mk 3 midgets more than I can count. I love this book."
2,Not up to today's standards,"This is definitely a CD that one won't want to listen to over and over again. The sound reproduction is pre-stereo and the playing is just so-so in the first one. In fact, the Concerto #20 played by Yvonne Lefebure is downright sub-standard. She rushes all of the technical spots and covers up a lot of mistakes. Serkin's sounds better! Also, the orchestra sounds subpar. They play these with such crudeness and roughness! Entrances are so abrupt. Definitely not up to today's standards. When I think of great Mozart Piano Concerto CD's, the one that comes to mind is Geza Anda with the Salzburg Mozarteum orchestra. He plays all 27 beautifully and exact with phenomenal technic! Generally, I think Casals was overrated along with many of the performers of that time. I'm sure the War was a major contributor to this. I bought many of the Casals CD's from Perpignan and none leave a favorable lasting memory. Performance standards today are much higher."
4,"Used to be the best set, there is one better.","This used to be the best collection of Abbott & Costello Colgate Comedy Hours, but now there is a 14 show set:Legends of Laughter: Abbott & Costello (Colgate Comedy Hour & Radio Shows)"
5,The best book I've read this year.,"Madison Smartt Bell does a masterful job of contrasting inner city and middle-class life through speech, thought, and experience. A good read...compares favorably with Richard Price's ""Clockers"""

4,Fits well. Phone doesn't deserve it.,This case worked well. It fits like a glove and didn't fall apart in daily use. Too bad that I can't say the same for the phone. Not one of Motorola's best efforts . . .
2,Low quality product,"I used this mask for about a month to soothe my puffy eyes before work. I kept it in the freezer and it mostly worked fine, although the plastic wasn't very comfortable against my face and i felt like the beads were actually suspended from my eye area (because of the way the mask is designed). Still, I was mostly happy with it until the mask burst, spilling tiny plastic beads ALL over the room! I still occasionally find pieces from it months later. This happened because a tiny hole had developed in the side of the mask and eventually it tore and started to spill. I'm not sure that I could have avoided this. Next time, I will just splurge on a nicer mask of higher quality."
4,ClosetMaid Track,Like this set - Very nice. Fairly easy to install considering they were added to the inside of a closet in my RV for more shelving and hope they stay put. Will know how they work come late fall/winter when we start our travels.
2,Kindle version impossible to read.,"This review is by my son, who is a big fan of the Pooch Cafe comic, and pertains only to the way the Kindle version of this book is presented.I have bought this book on Kindle and I must warn you the print in stupidly small. So if you are buying this to read on Kindle, don't bother. If you are buying this as a collectors item, then don't expect to be able to read it."
4,thorough historical and institutional analysis,"As an economist at the EC I found this book a good reference work on EMU, strong especially on the history of ERM and EMU and the institutional set-up of both. The arguments pro and con on EMU were well presented and often subtle. Overall highly recommended as textbook for graduate students and professional economists."
3,"Great Movie, but DVD Is Defective","The reason I'm giving this three stars is because of the problems I've had with the DVD. I absolutely love this film. I first bought it at a store while browsing. Unfortunately the DVD was defective. I took it back and then ordered it from Amazon, that too was defective. Amazon sent me a replacement, same problem. As soon as you get to scene 16 the film jumps to an FBI warning, same thing happens with the commentary. There is no way to finish the film. DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS PROBLEM? better yet CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE I CAN GET A GOOD COPY ON DVD? I'd appreciate it."
5,Tear Jerker,"I was 13 when I saw this film the first time in a movie theater-I cried. I saw it again on video 15 years later and cried even harder. I've seen it several times since and guess what-I still cried. I don't whatch movies more than once but this one has something that I am drawn to. Little Ricky Schroder is adorable throughout the movie. Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway are fantastic. The overall tone of the movie is sad-unfortunately this could be any childs life. If you are aware of addiction and the behaviors that go along with it-you will ralate. Get a box of kleenex, curl up and be glad your life isn't like this."
5,This is definately a classic....,"I remember when I saw this movie for the first time. I was 8 years old and it was the first time I ever cried at a movie. It was the first time I ever felt totally affected by a movie. At that time they passed out promotional buttons when you left the theater that said ""I saw the Champ"". I wore it everyday for a week. Ricky Schroeder steals the movie from all the adults in this movie (you can't take your eyes off of him). He gave a performance that is to this day unmatched by a child his age (yes, better than the kid from the Sixth Sense). I am so glad it has come out on DVD WITH extras! I have preordered 3 copies (for myself and my friends who don't know how awesome this movie is). I can't wait until they come."
1,Too schmaltzy!,"A fun drinking game with this movie is to take a shot everytime that little ragamuffin says the word ""Champ""!Seriously, every sentence uttered by Silver Spoons ends in the word ""Champ"". It gets really tiresome.""What's-a-matta, Champ?"", ""He's the Champ!"", ""Love you, Champ""! The movie is called ""Champ"". It's about a ""Champ"". He's the ""Champ""! Jeesh, we get it! Stop hitting us over the head with the obvious every five seconds!"
1,What happended to Jon Voight?!!,"I used to enjoy Jon Voight. Deliverance was perfect, and he was rockin' it in Heat. Midnight Cowboy was lovely. I even dug the Champ. Now I learn that he's a complete fool who hates Obama and thinks the country is headed to hell (or at least socialism). No wonder Angelina won't speak to him anymore. Doesn't it just suck when actors you admired do that? Damn. Jon, you're an idiot mate."
2,defective DVD,Movie is excellent after I bought the DVD it would just play up to scene 14 and skip to the end..they replaced it and it was the same thing.. I finally had to go rent the movie and watch it...strong performance by both actors...movie is a ***** (five star) but not on DVD
3,Movie that kept the family without short of tears of joy,"A day to day happening of a typical family, in between them left a kid to decide his torn love for the parents. The man who wants to prove a point to his ex-wife that he too could provide financial security to his son, but not short of sparing blood in his attempt.I saw this movie in 1982 for atleast 3 times and it is still fresh in my mind."
2,"Movie's great, DVD wasn't!","Well, I do love the movie ""The Champ"". Actually, we ""tried"" to watch it last night and it was completely fine until about the 8th scene, where it stopped and there was nothing on it afterward. We tried to put it into another DVD player on another tv and unfortunately, the same thing. I guess the DVD is defective. It was mailed in good time and everything in that regard was fine, it's just that it didn't work after the 8th scene. We tried everything after that scene, yet nothing would show. Well, I hope I could get another copy. thanks."
4,THE CHAMP,THIS IS ONE GOOOOOOD DVD. IT MAKES YOU LAUGH AND THEN LEAVES YOU CRYING. IT WAS DELIVERED IN GOOD TIME. AND IN GREAT CONDITION.
4,old movie,"enjoyed the movie ""the champ"" again after first having seen it over 30 years ago.Found the movie just as sad as the first time around.mly"
5,totaly as good as I expected!,This was the book I was missing from Cincy Dees' Charley Squad series and it was every bit as good as the rest of the series.
5,Molavi and Molavi,"There's a Persian poem by Molavi, the poet, written several centuries ago. It exposes you to how in Persian culture, ""me"" as a concept, is consered to be impolite.Someone's knocking on a door - and being asked who they are. ""It's me"" - is the repetitive response. The door remains firmly shut. Until finally, the knocker changes his respone: ""It's you"" and finds himself stepping into the house.I'm still looking for this poem as I only remember the sense of it. Today, I wanted to read up a little on Molavi, the poet, himself. I grabbed my ""Persian Pilgrimages"" knowing that I'm going to have an historic insight into my quest; one that would be interwoven with a contmeporary personal insight of Afshin Molavi's.And then it hit me, my Molavi's going to take me to the other Molavi ...What I enjoy most about this book is the fact that I know I shall be going back to it over and over in my life."
3,Butt -kick the editor,"I found this book very informative as I had planned a trip to Iran until the Bam disaster happened. As a non muslim I found the descriptions of life ,politics and religion and the synergy of the 3 (if synergy is the right word)intriguing. The book certainly helps me to understand this whole ME business a little better.However :WHAT SLOPPY WRITING!!!!! THe author s editors let him down badly.The numerous repetitions of insights and episodes , grammatical errors and spelling mistakes diminished my pleasure considerably and led to my low rating of an otherwise valuable addition to my library."
3,good but...,"As an Iranologist I am disappointed. Molavi gives a nice & detailed account of his travels, and of the present unhappy situation in this ancient and culturally rich country; but his discussion of Iranian history is, at times, flawed. For instance, while discussing the phenomenon of the Farsi alphabet he writes: ""Iran accepted the Arabic alphabet because it proved to be manifestly superior to its own 'cuneiform'.(p 55)"" Farsi (Arabic) alphabet did not replace 'cuneiform', it replaced 'ham-dabirih' script (a script that had evolved in Iran -- also known as Pahlavi) which was not in any way inferior to Arabic script. Cuneiform was a script employed by the Achaemenids on the inscriptions, it was not used by the pre-Islamic Iranians. This book, so far as 'historical research' is concerned, lacks better editing."
2,Field Guide Misleading,"The title, ""A Field Guide to Birds of the Big Bend"" is extremely misleading. I purchased this book as a guide for my first bird watching trip to Big Bend National Park. With 'field guide' in the title, I expected the book to assist me with identifying birds found in the Big Bend area. There are few pictures in the book and all of them are black and white sketches. This book is not useful for identifying birds and therefore does not fit the common definition of 'field guide' used by resources common to every birder such as the Peterson and Audubon field guides. I was extremely disappointed and returned the book."
4,"Informative, but not really a field guide","This ""field guide"" is only a field guide in the sense of the size of the book and the overall brevity of the species accounts. It lacks the detailed art/photos that most bird guides contain to aid in the ID of species. This book is very useful as a secondary reference to a better field guide since it gives information specific to the Big Bend area. There are black and white drawings that are helpful to some extent, but this publication is most useful for its area specific details of each species described."
3,Nice for Greenhouse Growers,"""Orchids are Easy"" is a helpful book for someone planning a greenhouse. The first part of the book goes into detail about the planning that goes into building a greenhouse--including location, building materials, necessary equipment, watering and climate control.Brief chapters cover the culture of orchids, propogation, pests and diseases. The final section is the ""A-Z of Orchid Species"". This area has nice closeups of each featured plant, but is pretty limited in scope. You won't find anything about Cattleyas, Phalaenopsis or Cymbidiums here.If you are looking for information on Oncidiums, Odontoglossums and some Dendrobiums you find solid information and nice photography."
4,orchids are easy,The book was not described very well. This particular book deals withgreenhouse growing orchids. I was interested in growing orchids in myhome. I have several plants which are now dormant and I was hoping tolearn about caring them for future blooming. Ellen Muth
4,Praise for Barbara Tuchman,Fascinating study of a rather esoteric subject and a history that most people are not that familiar with. Tuchman handles the subject with her usual keen scholarship and very readable style. Important to understand the background of what is happening in the Middle East today.
4,"Not ""Guns of August"" or ""Zimmerman"" but still worth reading","Not sure why this book grabbed me when I sampled it. I was not expecting to read it, but only after a few pages, I was hooked.Though it lacks Tuchman's colorful character descriptions, it covers a lot more surface area. Neither a book about England or Israel, it's a book that describes how Evangelicalism and political exigencies co-mingled to create a Jewish Homeland.Worth reading."
2,Caution--Will Not Work on MAC system X.2,"As of 10/2/02 this product will not work with MAC system X.2. The driver software is still not written. I have no experience with this product and the Windows platform.On MAC system 9, the product works fine--good quality, but very slow by today's standards, especially draft quality printing.For all systems and platforms ask yourself if you really need the feature ""camera chip inserted directly into the printer."" Most people now have good computer software that really eliminates the necessity of this direct-to-printer feature."
1,Strange mix,This book is a very strange mix of useful bushido wisdom and paranoid Christian end-times non-sense. One chapter tells Christians they must be prepared to kill their persecutors when the AntiChrist arrives. A very strange book. Recommended for paranoid warrior-oriented fundamentalist Christians. Not recommended for anyone who wants to know about Bushido.
1,Buddhism and Shintoism aren't religions?????,"This is a great book, on Christian militancy and millenial paranoia. I wish that the author had tried to indicate his close relationship with Christ in the title, as I would have filed it in 'Western Theology', rather than 'Eastern Mysticism and Martial Arts'. Quite a shame."
3,"Average sex and tooth fest......ummmm, no even that :(","Should have known by the Playboy label that this would be a fizzer. Yes, its full of gorgeous ladies, but with a lame plot and poor acting. In fact, if it wasn't for the talent (and I don't mean acting) it barely would have scratched 1 star. So if you like alot of T&A with your neck biting (you sick puppy), then this might just be for you."
3,below average Playboy movie,"This is a Playboy movie (under the Eros production name) that is best described as a late-night softcore skin fest with a hokey vampire storyline plugged inbetween the steamy love scenes.The women here are actually quite beautiful, and there are a good number of love scenes here. Instead of the typical 2 or 3 scenes you might see in a typical Showtime or Cinemax late-night movie, there are about 7 or 8 love scenes here. At least 1 every 10 minutes, some scenes go for quite a few minutes.Lots of gratuitous skin showing by the two lead actresses, Madison Clark (who bears a resemblance to actress Mia Sara) as the good girl and Angelia High as the bad girl.If you're looking for a decent plot or suspense, you won't find it here. If you want to see a female version of Interview with the Vampire, this movie might fulfill your fetish.The DVD itself is very barebones, with only a chapter selection as its only menu."
1,Only Good For...,"This movie is only good for the erotic sex scene with the hot guy and the gray haired vamp. He says that he never did anything like that before (yeah, right). Just look at his hot face, and body, then listen to his voice...mmm...also look at his face during the sex scene and right before she bites him. After all that his legs and pulled down pants and underwear shake...ooh, I am so hot right now. It's too bad that he had to bite the dust...LOL. If you are a teenage boy like me see this movie for the hot chicks too."
3,Winter goes the roots !,"Edgar Winter made it . This recording is remarkable. It contains memorable tracks.Good o'shoe is a country folk blues well made , the rhythmic section is excellent .The onions is another folk song with chorus and a style who reminds me too much to Leon Russell in the seventies .Texas may be well one the three best tracks of the CD . The potent voice combines with the most original country folk mood .Time millennium is a hard piece , with strong presence . Trumpets and guitar blend in a very interesting approach and a very solid built theme.White man's blues is a punch theme . And to me the most solid track of the CD"
2,What did he say? Rewind that!,"Wasted potential. This movie tries so hard to be creepy that it ruins itself. Everyone whispers throughout every dialog scene, and their voices are further obscured by the constant cacophony of eerie music and sound effects. If you turn it up to hear the words, the shrieks of the mothman sightings will shoot your speaker voice coils across the room. I, English speaking from birth, had to turn on the subtitles to know what they were mumbling about. Very frustrating. Also, the ONLY relationship between the movie and reality is reports of something creepy seen in the woods and the collapse of the bridge. Weak. The only good thing about this movie was the depiction of the bridge collapse. Convincing."
2,Visually stunning but Boring as heck,"""Mothman Prophecies"" has Richard Gere, and it was beautifully filmed. These are the two things going for it.The story seemed interesting as first, but I was soon bored. It didn't seem to be moving to quickly. Very slow and uneven in parts.Even the fact that it was based on ""true events"" didn't really keep me interested. Even with it's good solid acting from Gere and Laura Linney, and Will Patton this movie still couldn't stay above water.It had a bad ending too.Save your money and time and skip this one."
2,Oh So Boring,"The Mothman Prophecies begins with so much potential, but never really develops into a story worthwhile telling. It is soooo repetitive. The actors do as well as they can with a really flat script.Definately missable."
5,chilling: better realized than the book,"I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged."
1,Terrible.,This movie was awful. It drags on and on and there's little explanation at the end. Wikipedia the events if you're interested in the story and save your time.
3,Takes Monster Movies a Step Further,"The Mothman Prophecies is a well-crafted, and at times terrifying, story based on true events that occurred in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1966. The setting for the film is modern times, and stars Richard Gere as a respected Washington Post reporter who becomes embroiled in the bizarre and surreal happenings in Point Pleasant.The story takes monster movies to the next level. Without giving away too much, the suggestion is that the Mothman is a kind of sentient being far superior to humans. Is he warning or just messing with John and the citizens of a small town?The music is great and had me jumping out of my skin in a few parts. Recommended for horror and psychological thriller fans. Very similar to X-Files."
3,hail the mothman,some creepiness is in this movie with some common jolts along the way and a nice finale that adds to the touch. Gere is fascinating as always. the bridge part where the bridge collapses in the water below is the coolest part in the movie. pretty freaky.
3,A satisfying film,"I wouldn't categorize this as a horror/thriller or anything of the sort. It's a different type of movie and it's hard to really place it anywhere. It has a dramatic plot with an eerie supernatural element. Its more of a mystery. A pretty decent one at that. Supposedly based off some factual event, the film does a good job of keeping us in suspense and really keeps us guessing. If there really is something called the Mothman, then I really would not want anything to do with that.The acting is quite fine, the score effective. It is nothing super extrodianary, but it does feel different than many other films in this genre, which is again, hard to really place. Never boring, it will keep your attention, but after it's all said and done, it is probably mostly forgettable."
4,Great Thriller,"This is a great movie. Probably the only good movie with Richard Geere. Very freaky with the lights off. The story is ok. Don't expect everything to be explained to you. It's supposed to be mysterious, like the X-files. If you like that show, you'll like the movie."
2,Boring,"This movie is truly one of the most boring I have ever seen. It's a good idea, and the beginning is chilling, but it falls flat after the first 10 minutes. Almost the entire film is spent talking, and talking, and talking... you actually only see the Mothman about three times in the whole thing. The final bridge scene is certainly terrifying, but it doesn't make up for sitting through 2 hours of boredom. All in all, this film had a great premise... but bad presentation."
5,excellant movie,"I saw this movie tonight in the theatres and right as the lights dimmed I thought ""This is going to be a good movie"". I dont know I guess my gut just told me that it was gunna be a good one. And heres a good tip, always trust your gut about a movie. And it was definately right about this movie. I really liked this movie. It was very unique and very creepy. Espesially because its all based on true events. Though I dont know if thats true or not. I really didnt know much about what this was about with the trailer but it didnt take long to figure out. Its basically about paranormal activity. Its actually very frightening and very unpredictable whcih I think can make or break a movie. I never knew what was going to come next and I really enjoy that kind of movies. And of course it had the pop out moments which every horror movie has to have. And I have to admit I jumped a couple times. I really liked this movie I give it 5 stars all around."
4,Tres Cool,"You like the paranormal, ghosts or any of that stuff - you will love this!! It is hip, modern and spooky without all the violence and gore. Best part about it is that it is derived from documented events. The music is right on the edge and the sound is superb. Also it is a great break for Richard Gere, something different and cool - and he is perfect for the role. Hope it does well at the box office."
4,Terrifying Mystery-Thriller,"The Mothman Prophecies is one of the scariest films I have ever seen. It blends fact wih fiction (creating a haunting and earily ""real"" atmosphere that one does not easily forget.) Richard Ghere is great as the lead, and the story moves along at an almost perfect pace. There is not much action in this movie, but trust me, once you've started there's no stopping, and once it's over you'll have to watch a seriously funny movie to counter it's effects. That being said, Mothman is an excellent film in almost every way, and I highly reccomend it to the thriller fan."
5,good movie,"I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed. I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident. The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller. The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based. Very interesting in its own right."
4,Indrid Cold,"""I have come to realize that we have been observing complex forces which have always been an essential part of our environment.""Author John Keel of the bookThe Mothman PropheciesThe collapse of the Silver Bridge is predicted by the people who confront an entity known as the Mothman.A good movie if your in the mood for a realistic horror science fiction film. In fact it is based on a true story. Alan Bates and Will Patton are fantastic in this film. Richard Gere was great and an interesting role for himThe Indrid Cold phone scene is terrifyingly real and well done.No confrontation with the 'Men in Black disappointed me greatly."
2,Weak movie,"I've been reviewing many films today and I've been very critical of each one and, sorry to say, I must slate this piece of work as well. The Mothman Prophecies, based on a true story, is a film mystery which deals with the conception of the rare African moth. If seen, it foretells a death. When Richard Gere's wife, Debra Messing, sees the moth, mysterious circumstances ensue which subsequently lead to her death. Pining for her, Gere eventually loses his mind and meets up with a new love interest, Laura Linney in an attempt to uncover the truth. While the plot may sound plausible it proves disappointing.The female characters are seriously underdeveloped with only a brief cameo with Debra Messing. Gere seems to get all the action.The ending is also disappointing and is left open ended but we are meant to accept this considering it is based on a true story.Still though, the film is worth watching if you're into mystery films. However, don't expect to be too impressed."
3,Horror??????????,"Although I rate this movie with a weak 3 stars, it is by no means a horror movie. Pretty good for a suspense/thriller type film, but no horror here. Richard Gere does give a good performance in this movie. Without going into all the details, this movie has good acting and good scenes and does not bore you to death like many other films I've seen. Worth renting if you have never seen this film before. Not bad entertainment."
2,The Boredom Prophecy,"This film is extremely slow paced. Ok, sometimes (even a lot of times!) a slow pace works, but this was not the case here. Here, the slow pace was changed into a heavy hand in direction: you feel the movie is ""heavy"", like overweighted, something like that.The actors do their best, but such interesting plot could be a whole more interesting to the viewer.This is very far from a total waste (the technicals are very good, the cinematography also, but I would not recommend it to anyone except those suffering from insomnia."
1,"All Special Effects, No Movie","What a waste of good acting!Line up a group of good actors, give them a pointless plot and dull dialogue, film them in scenes that are ALL RED or ALL BLUE or ALL BLACK--and what do you have?The Mothman Prophecies, a suspense movie without suspense, without interesting characters, without clarity, without a coherent plot, without coherent symbolism, but WITH oodles of odd camera-angles and murky colors to make you think something is going on.Alas.Nothing is.One small, typical example. Richard Gere tells Laura Linney (a cop) about the near-hallucinatory visions of another character. ""I had a dream like that,"" she portentously replies; then proceeds to tell the dream, and they show it (All Blue and All Black), and it has no likeness whatever to the other guy's visions--they hit you over the head with the idea that it's a prediction."
1,If I could rate it lower I would,"I hated this movie. I usually love all things wierd and scientific and I like Richard Gere, but I don't know what went wrong. I watched this and every fade out I just hoped it was the end. I celebrated when this movie was over. It is over 2 hours of my life I cannot get back. This is a horrible movie and I wouldn't reccommend watching it unless you are left on a deserted island with plenty of food and a tv that won't get cable so that this is your only source of entertainment. Even then it would be touch and go."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A mediocre thriller, The Mothman Prophecies suceeds in generating a sense of creepiness but somewhat requires a belief in the supernatural for it to work--it's not bad but it's also not worth seeking out."
3,Definately see it once,"This movie was all atmosphere...I don't think there was a drop of gore in it. It was a wild ride, and I reccomend you see it once...but I don't know if you'll want to watch it again. The trailers were a lot better. The movie reminded me of a long episode of The X-Files, complete with the open ending. I just wanted more out of this movie, because the buildup was so killer.Oh yeah...and YOU NEVER SEE THE MONSTER. Just be warned.And there are a lot of cool cheap scares."
3,An Urban Legend!?!,"This is a movie based on things that supposedly happened in real life. In 1964 a dark phantom appeared and haunted the small and dreary little town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The Mothman is a bird-like creature that drives some people nearly insane and others to their death. The movie starts out well and one is quite hopeful given the interesting plot and the starring actor. But it never really picks up the pace and the story begins to drag and never fully develops. It was a movie theme with a lot of potential but overall I felt this movie was a disappointment."
2,Slow...,"I like suspense, but this movie was just plain boring. Everybody was cryptic, including the main character. I think this movie only has good reviews because it starred Richard Gere."
4,Good Movie,I watched this movie. It is spooky mostly because the movie is based on a book that is based on real life events. Google it!
3,Kind of tedious and confusing,"This was suspenful enough but had a wiz-bang ending, but in the end you had to ask yourself what this story was all about. It seems like one of those movies that is made from a book that had a great story, but in making the movie they had to cut so much out that it did not hang together."
2,Movie would be great if the viewing experience were better.,"The movie was blurry,and the words were said before the actors said them... not a good experience at all. too bad."
3,Should of stuck with the book.,"It would of been better if this film would of just stuck with the ideas and events that are mentioned in the book instead of trying to make it modern. Other than that, the movie was good. It is a great movie for all Sci Fi lovers."
3,The Mothman Prophecies,I liked the movie and the actors played their parts well. The background music fit the film well. I was a little disappointed that it did not follow the details set out in the book. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not read the book first.
4,Very pleased!!!,"My mother is from a small town close to Point Pleasant, WV which is a point of interest in this movie. She had seen the movie before but, never got the name of it. When she finially discovered the name, I got on line and within a few days she had this movie and is very pleased with it. Thank You, R. Head Chatsworth, GA"
1,Just Awful,"Boring, meandering ""thriller"" that should never have been made. The mysteries aren't wrapped up, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. The non-resolution would have bothered me more if I truly cared about anything in this terrible movie. Skip this one!"
2,Disappointing!,"Whatever goal authors of this movie were trying to achieve (and I am not sure what this movie was intended to be) they failed in all aspects of it. Although the movie was advertised as sci-fi it has nothing to do with it (just mention of some alien form doesn't make a movie sci-fi). If it's supposed to be a 'psychological thriller' the psycology part requires at least some logical completion and this movie full of huge holes in the plot. As of thriller, contrary to what was written in some reviews, I found it very boring and almost totaly lacking any suspense. There is no really space for actors to play and Richard Gere pretty much just plays so familiar himself."
2,Extremely Dissapointing,This movie was extrely dissapoiting. It started confusing the viewers and ends the same. Not even the good performance by Richard Gere could save this movie. I found it boring and without a strong plot.
2,Tedious and Dull!,"I think perhaps Richard Gere is not the right actor for this type of film. He's great in say dramas and films centered around romance, but horror/suspence, I think he's rather stoic considering the events of this film. This film plods along like a bad Stephen King made-for-television-movie. It's dull to the point of me yelling at the screen demanding Gere to losen up and be apart of this very bad movie. Rent first if you truly must see it."
2,& my prophecy is...,"Doom to the watcher of this movie. Ok, the mothman's prophecies all came true, but what was his connection with Gere's dead wife? What promised to be a suspense at the begininng turned out to be dragging & annoying & POINTLESS. If ever there was a pont the makers were trying to make, it got lost somewhere in the middle. I do not recommend this film at all. Please don't buy the DVD or VCD or whatever copy is available at the market...don't rent it even. If you do not follow my advice, I predict you will have such a terrible time watching it. You might even turn into a mothman yourself. That's my own prophecy!!!"
1,Don't bother with the movie; read the book!,"This movie seems like a purposeful mangling of the Mothman story. The book is fascinating and would have made an excellent movie. It's too bad they didn't put the story in the movie, it could have been great. They should have set it in the time period when it really happened and not made it such a vague concept. It also had nothing to do with the investigator's wife; I don't even remember him mentioning a wife in the book. I was so disappointed in this movie. The book is great though!"
1,A WASTE OF TWO HOURS,"I want that time in my life back. DUMB, ANNOYING MOVIE! Lots of phone calls, creepy stuff, MOOD, but no payoff, and I resent the alleged ""TRUE"" label. What a joke!DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!"
1,Rent - Not buy,"Quite a boring film. Leaves you with a ""should have somewhere with such a great premise but didn't"" feeling. I'd rent it, but I wouldn't buy it."
1,BORING,"I hated it.Richard Gere is passing his time on the phone and in his bedroom. The movie is full of noisy sound. You expect to see something surnatural and you see nothing.The scariest stuff you will see,is few red lights in the dark.By writting based on true events, I wonder if someone is thinking we are all a bunch of idiots or something."
4,A very good movie but not true to book,"I liked this movie. It was neat crisp very well acted a 'scary' movie of the unseen terror mode. It had a eerie sense of foreboding from the opening credits and it had a great ending. But it would have been better, in some ways, if it had not been titled as it was. The basic plot line of the movie is nothing , and I do mean nothing,like the book. In some ways it would be better to know nothing about John Keel or his book before seeing this because if you do and you go see this expecting that type of movie, you are bound to be disappointed."
3,"Entertaining, but contrived - and entirely fictional","I was required to see this film on its opening weekend because I was researching an article about its origins for ""The Skeptical Inquirer."" I actually enjoyed the movie far more than I expected, largely for the way it was structured. However, I wondered why the story was updated to the modern day from the 1967 period -- a time rife with paranoia -- described in John A. Keel's original book. This change undermined any sense of reality the story might have had. Not that there was much in the first place.My subsequent article may be read at this URL: [local website]. There I describe how Gray Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time. Those who wonder what to believe should read this, if only to understand that there is indeed ""more to the story."""
2,REALLY?!!,"I have one question here... is this movie ""REALLY"" based on true events?!! Umm... Hmm...The only way to swallow this movie is to ""REALLY"" believe it was based on true events, but I can't believe so!I think the main weak point is the ""Mothman"" theory, that's why if you don't accept it you won't be able to go with it all along. I think if it was not for Richard Gere, no one would have even heard of the movie!"
3,Couldn't rate it...couldn't finish it,"Very scary. I went out and sat on the sunny patio while they finished it. However, I awoke at 3:30 this morning and turned on the light. Would really like to get some sleep tonight."
1,Crap,When I ordered this movie I was totally excited. I've seen it before but can't find it in the stores anywhere. so I ordered it on here. when I got the stupid thing I discovered the whole thing was in German. can't watch it!!! hate it hate it hate it... FALSE ADVERTISEMENT DO NOT BUY
2,"""The Mothman Prophecies"" isn't that great","""The Mothman Prophecies"" seemed kind of intriguing and I've heard about it before, so I decided to see it. I expected an intense and creepy thriller, but it doesn't really deliver. The music playing during the opening credits make itseems like it's going to be a scary movie, and then the beginning starts. It moves at an extremely slow pace, and I was okay with it. More and more of the story and character development comes in and finally, some of the scares come in. It doesn't really do much until you hear the mothman, who's name is Indrid Cold. I thought it sounded scary and later on you find out it didn't come from human vocal cords, and after that they don't explain anything. What was it then? The film really doesn't do much, although it had good drama. I give it two and a half stars for the drama, story, and intense ending."
4,soul stirring,"a highly stirring, soul churning tour of fear and loss that taps into emotions in far more powerful ways than most horror and psychological thrillers.The camera shots are spectacular and the performances are masterful.I was surprised and shocked by this extremely well made film."
3,"Début Intéressant, Milieu Moyen, Fin Surprenante","Un thriller avec Richard Geere? Voilà une idée auquelle j'avais du mal à adhérer. Celui qui se fait souvent reconnatre pour des comédies romantiques joue dans The Mothman Prophecies le rle d'un homme poursuivie par un tre paranormal capable de prédire l'avenir. Mme si l'idée est bonne, le concept reste lourd. Il faut un immense sens de la déduction pour en tirer quelque chose. Mais néamoins, achtez ce film, si ce n'est que pour le dénouement final. Personnellement, j'ai du mal à croire que ce film est basé sur une histoire vraie........"
3,Needs more...,I was really looking forward to this movie for awhile and as always I expect too much from a movie like this. My first complaint was that the being was never really seen. There was always some type of blur too quick to get an idea of what that thing looked like. Other than that the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie seems too outrageous to be based on true events but it is good enough to buy. My advice is to rent it first then go from there.
4,Perfect Thriller!,Don't watch this movie alone. Sound effects throughout the DVD left me jumping and looking over my shoulders. Cinematography was spooky. The vivid picture quality brought to life every aspect of the movie. You may have trouble sleeping. The story line is new and works great. Some parts were slow but finding out what happenings next keeps the interest fresh.
5,A great horror/suspense film!,"""The Mothman Prophecies"", based on a bestselling book of the same name, is a superb ""thriller"" with good acting, a moody and eerie atmosphere, and an excellent musical score. John Klein (Richard Gere) is a political reporter from Washington who's grieving over his wife's (Debra Messing) strange death after seeing a mysterious and frightening creature while driving home one evening. One night he's traveling to Virginia to do a story when he suddenly finds himself in a small town in West Virginia, hundreds of miles from his destination - and he has no idea of how he got there. Finding out how - and why - he wound up in Point Pleasant is one of the best and creepiest movie experiences from 2002. Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Alan Bates turn in strong supporting performances. Recommended!"
5,Terror from above or below?,"I give this movie high ratings, I just saw it last night from 2am to 4am. Big mistake, it scared the living garbanzo beans out of me and I simply could not sleep. I kept having horrible dreams. The film is great because it doesn't show much but instead taps into that primitive imagination of ours. Whoo! Very good job. Watch it late one night like me, but don't see it alone!"
4,A satisfing thriller.,"""The Mothman Prophecies"" was defintly a satifing thriller. I went to see it back in Jaunary the first day it came out with a couple friends and we enjoyed it> Now most thriller/horror movieslook good but are only usually only okay. But not this! I was really happy it. The movie was well acted. Richard Gere (who is good) turned it a good perofrmance and made you belive that he was really seeing these things and Will Paton also made it beilvable. The director defintly did a good job of thrilling & chilling you. This is defitnly a DVD I'm going to be picking up.7/10"
2,Not Enough,"This book has a good promise but ultimately falls short of covering what the title proclaims. First of all, the version I got didnt have the games attached to the book. This was sad, since the author spends some precious pages describing the rules of the games I did not get. There are only 64 pages in this book. I actually found the text very interesting, but the illustrations kill this book. Its simly a collection of bad quality black and white engravings and sketches from the period, plus some heraldic designs IN BLACK AND WHITE. Some original illustrations, ala Osprey would have been much nicer. Oh, and by the way, not a single word on medieval wargames. Terence Wise has a much cheaper book about medieval warfare, that has a nice section on wargames. And it was much cheaper."
2,"""Virtual Paintball""","This was an ok deal for [...] but was really glad, before we wrapped it, we double checked HOW to load the paintballs. This was a ""virtual paintgun"" that makes sounds with a color display as if.... it were shooting. It works ok for the little kids (4 year olds), but the 8 and 9 year old kids they would have REALLY been disapointed which would NOT have made a very happy Grandmother."
1,Does not work,My grandson loved this toy until he started playing with it. It was broken within 5 minutes - he is 6 yrs old. Does not work. Would not recommend
5,Great Solution,Very easy to take on and off thanks to the pole. I would have added a better solution at the bottom to keep pests out the elastic sucks. i put a tie wrap on it to make it work. Wish the color was offered in brown to match my patio set... Maybe in the future. So far it has held up great (90 days)
4,Outdoor Umbrella Cover,Good product. Appears that it will hold up over time in weather. Sewn-in wand makes putting cover on a lot easier.
4,Great Value For The Price,"This umbrella cover replaced one that I had for over 10 years. The old one had a rod in it that enbaled you to lift the cover up over the top of the umbrella - a great feature for a short person. I searched and searched and this was the only one I could find that had the same feature, but slightly different. The cover itself is sturdy material and I can see it lasting at least 10 years. However, the rod is meant to be disassembled each time you put it on the umbrella, but you can just leave it assembled and tuck it in next to the umbrella before you zip it shut. Also, tie a string of some sort to the zipper - makes it easier to pull it down unless you're really tall."
3,Beware of your umbrella type,"I was very happy when I received the umbrella cover. The quality is really nice. BUT when I went to put it on the umbrella, it turned out to be too small. My umbrella is 10' vs the 11' limit in the description. The length is OK, but the Homecrest umbrella I need to cover is very strong and it did not fit in the cover, no matter how my husband and I held it down.If your umbrella is not too hard, I would definitely recommend it."
5,Easy to Use Umbrella Cover,"I absolutely love this easy to use umbrella cover. The inside attached wand makes it effortless to cover and uncover the umbrella. The material is very durable, it is nice looking, but the best part is that it is so easy to use and takes just seconds to cover and uncover the umbrella."
5,Great Product,"Great product! Fits my 8.5"" umbrella well and is quality made. My previous umbrella had a pole to help extend over the top of the umbrella as does this one. Great feature, great product and great price..."
4,Strong resource for lovers of traditional Catholic liturgy,"Highly readable and sadly amusing 1990/1992 book quoting priests and religious advocates of ""New Agey"" liturgical changes...some of whom have either been excommunicated or left voluntarily by the time of this review (1998.) Good resource for Catholics who support respect for tradition in liturgy, who aren't sure why some of the radical changes don't ""feel right"" spiritually, or who just don't like underrdressed informality and bad music at their Sunday Masses."
1,A total piece of fiction by a heretic,"A piece of garbage from the outset by a man with heretical views of the Church, her saints and the Papacy. England purports to be a theologian but has no training and it shows when he condemns a Franciscan and Jesuit theology of the earth as dangerous thinking. If we listen to England it is OK to destroy all of the earth and learn nothing from the wisdom of its original people becuase it will be done in the name of the Church. He even goes as far as to denigrate Saints in waiting Teilhard de Chardin and Thomas Merton, thereby dismissing the wisdom of those Vatican officials including Pope Benedict XVI who have built on their teachings.[...]"
4,A slight correction,"Strathmore 400 Watercolor paper is actually the normal 140 lb paper. It is fine for sketching and just about anything but your final painting. In block form it is very handy to use en plein air. I use 300 lb Arches for my ""serious"" painting."
4,Nice quality paper,My Wife and Sons use this for art projects. It is sturdy quality paper. We even have some pictures hanging in our house for decoration.
1,At least it ends...,"This is a sad end of a very painful series. All three books just don't seem to fit in the 'Xena' Universe. And the ending, while being right out of a Greek style play, is not really fulfilling. Don't get me wrong, I want books to be made about Xena, BUT by somebody else! I don't need to know every little detail of a dusty trail or a copper cup or the deep blue sea."
3,"Tastes great, less filling","While I absolutely love everything to do with the Xenaverse, I was a little disappointed with this conclusion to Ru Emmerson's series. The story was good, but it was kinda out of a Greek drama (hmmm... guess I shouldn't complain since it's about a couple of ancient Greeks) but after all the buildup in the first two about how difficult it was going to be to find Helen, I was dimayed how how absurdly easy it ended up being and the whole segment in the maze was not very believable. I also had some difficulty with her portrayal of Gabrielle and her relationship with Xena... finding it difficult to place exactly when during the series this might have taken place.On the flip side. Will I keep this book in my collection? Yup. Will I read this book again? You betcha."
3,Typical Cash,If you like Johnny Cash you will like this CD. Johnny Cash can't sound any different from all of his other stuff.
1,Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears,"Being a Johnny Cash Fan for years,I had this as a record and have been looking for it for several monthsas a CD. I only found it at Amazon. Thank you very much for carring it in stock.Bill Westlake"
5,Bitter Tears by Johnny Cash,"A crowning achievement! Is as good now and as important as it was when it was released! A MUST for every American! ""The Ballad Of Ira Hayes"" chronicles the life of one of the flag raisers on Iwo Jima. Fascinating listening and an overall excellent album! Truly a masterpiece!"
5,A real heartbreaker,"This is actually my favorite Cash album (I have at least 30).It's also the shortest, so it must be good. The subject matter, which is the Native Americans perspective on white men, is heartbreaking and sad. Broken treaties, broken hearts, broken dreams, broken bottles. You've heard Ira Hayes, and the rest of the songs are pretty much like that. But this album could be about knitting and I'd still love it because the music is so good. It's bittersweet, not rocking, but not boring. If you like John Henry, or Ride this Train, you'll like this. It's on par with all the other albums he did with Don Law, and if you like that period, you'll love this album."
5,"Hilarious, poignant, memorable; my favorite!","Brock Cole demonstrates an unparalleled poetry of language and an unforgettable sense of humor. A book populated thickly with absolutely realistic characters, from Celine herself to Lucile to Paul Barker. At once sad and hilarious, it ends as it should, undecided. I find myself recalling lines and situations from it often, even if I haven't read it in forever. My favorite for three years running! Deserves every single award it gets!"
5,Teen Shows A Little Responsibilty!,"Our heroine, Celine, is much funnier than Holden Caulfield.Every day, she is presented with absurdity and she justhas to laugh. Which makes sense; too few people choose to laugh when that's really the only way to go. It is her sense of humor and her strength of purpose and character that carry her through the progressively stressful events of the novel and which carry us through the novel itself. The book is full of allusions to other works, including The Great Gatsby, Nausea, and (of course) The Catcher in the Rye. We should all be more like Celine."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a huge fan of books and usually love most but this book was the worst book I've ever read. I had to read it for school and if it had been mine, I would have thrown it away. The profanity and sexuality and gross emotional display through out the story is degrating to all women and the book is better used as a paper weight than anything else. While some of the ideas may be similar to real life, the way the young girl relates to all her problems is nothing like the way a real person would act. Please, PLEASE don't read this book!!"
3,Doesn't feel authentic.,"The music on this CD is nicely arranged and played, but it sounds too orchestrated! To be fair, it is performed by the 101 Strings Orchestra and it wasn't misrepresented in the write-up. But I was looking for music with a folksy feel like you might hear at a cafe in Greece, and this is not it."
4,Easy to use,"I found the labeler easy to use. The software program could use more and better graphics, but it's easy to add your own pictures. Overall, I love this product. Makes great CD's."
2,"Great hardware, lousy software","The combination of labels and applicator is really foolproof - it just works. But the afterburner labels do not seem to be an official Avery product (could not find generic templates on the website, the product number is unknown, etc), so in practice you're tied to the included Click'N'Design software -- which is slow, clumsy and buggy.If Avery would fully support the labels (outside of the ""afterburner"" ghetto), the product would earn four stars. (If they would replace the horrible software, it would get five.)"
1,John,"The mechanics (label application device etc.)of this system are fine. The software is horrible! It is without a doubt the worst I have ever had the misfortune to have purchased. Difficult, if not impossible to ""make it do"" what I want. Simply adding text where you want is a rediculous chore. Don't buy it. If someone offers it for free, refuse.Honestly, this one is bad!"
5,Great Value,This cable transmits a great signal and cost substantially less than many alternatives. We are very pleased with it's performance.
5,Accell 25 feet HDMI cable,"At the price of 35.00 + ship + tax this is a great product. Any otyher brand will cost you between $150.00 to $220.00 ( BestBuy about 200.00). I am connecting my PC to my 1080i 50"" TV to watch HULU HD and the image looks great.Now with my wirelss mause and Keyborad (HP 27Mhz) I can do aniything I want. As I stated before this is a cost effective solution. If you have a extra-money you could buy a wireless HDMI kit"
4,Works as advertised,"This is the max length per standards for HDMI cabling. Works fine. The cable goes up a wall , across a bit of attic, and back down to the HDTV. The only issue was that the cable is pretty stiff and that makes it a bit more troublesome to pull if you are doing it alone."
1,Cheaply made - you get what you pay for.,"Man, was I happy to find a 32-ft cable for my media room at a decent price. The other good reviews sold me on this one. Go Amazon, right? I had a heck of a time crawling through my attic and fishing this cable down through my wall. At first, the cable worked as it should, turn on projector, plug into receiver and voila! But the slightest bit of movement caused the connector to completely come apart. The cable itself seems thick, well shielded, and provided a good image quality, but it seems like they went ultra cheap on the connectors. I would've rather paid a little extra, than to have to get a new cable and re-fish it through my attic."
3,Lasted 1.5 years,"The end came out of the cable. It's hard to describe, but the metal part came loose from the plastic housing, revealing the various wires inside. Cable is completely unfixable. The cable worked perfectly before it broke. I was moving my receiver around to connect a new device, and it just broke. I'm not sure if the cable is at fault as any long cable will have an inherent problem with leverage at the connector. A note to manufacturers....when you design a new connector standard, please take into account that not all installations are static and some accommodations should be made for strain reliefs to remove stress from the connector. The thickness of the cable puts a lot of leverage on the connector."
5,Chamber music,for me Rasetti Amédée was unknown. I first heard his musik in the radio. I like it very much and cann't stop listening to the CD as well.
3,"An odd, really creepy movie.","Antropoligists find frozen apeman in Sibera. They then take it on the trans siberian express. The thing thaws on board and the alien assence that possessed it millions of years ago sends it on a killing spree. Soon the thing is killed and the alien force keeps on possessing human beings and turning them into red-eyed zombies. Odd, yet interesting."
4,too dark,this is a pretty good movie as far as the story & actors go but it is so dark expecially in the last part you can's see what is going on. They have to turn off the lights to tell who has been infected but then you can't see that is going on. very disappointing. I would have enjoyed it more if I could have seen what was going on. Way too dark. I could not even see when Telli was killed. kind of grose in parts. when you could see.
1,Decent Horror Movie but watch out for the versions,"I bought this movie after seeing it on TV. It is a decent little horror flick, BUT the copy I got (cover ""Different from the one shown"", quoted from the remarks by the seller, for used/new marketplace copies) is from Diamond Entertainment. Packaged attractively, professionally, and with some (useless)special features -- don't be fooled, this is a BAD transfer to DVD. Some scenes inexplicably shimmer, as if you were looking at some gently sloooooshing water. Overall, the image quality is BAD, like it was filmed from a film screen rather than a direct transfer from an original source. Watch out. Don't waste hard earned money on bad copies, unless you are desparate."
2,COULD DO BETTER,"This DVD is marginally better than the pan&scan DVD previously released. The picture quality is still full of scratches and the image is still rather fuzzy - despite the inner sleeve claiming ""digital transfer"" offering superb image clarity - they must have used the wrong print in this case. The sound is ok, and the ""widescreen"" image is barely noticeable. On the whole, not worth the money or effort."
3,Train of terror,"Think what could've been, if only Hammer had made their early 70s movies like this ?. -We would've had a lot more interesting Hammer films to watch now, that's what. (Instead they tried to be the ""Carry On"" of Horror, by bringing in comedy and nudity.) A train movie with Lee, Cushing and Savalas on board has got to be a good and exciting movie, and ""Horror Express"" is just that. Sadly the presentation here leaves things to be desired. The picture quality is o.k., but I'm sure it can be a lot sharper than it is. It says ""widescreen"" on the front cover, but I would hardly call it that. -It's barely noticeable, and I doubt the tiny bit we get here, is really the whole deal. Also, the soundtrack doesn't seem to run synchronized with the picture, but I don't recall if it was always so with this film. I don't know if it'll ever get another DVD release, as this is the 3rd already, but it certainly deserves it."
3,STOP THE TRAIN,"No matter how bad a film can be, when you have Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing together, it can't be all bad. Actually, this is a tidy little thriller, with lots of suspense and bloodletting. Lee plays an archaeologist who discovers a frozen cadaver in the Manchurian mountains and takes it on board the train for further study. But what kind of creature is this? Cushing plays a fellow scientist who wants to know. The passengers are all pretty cliche, but the thrills mount. Telly Savalas comes in late in the movie as head of a Cossack army, and this addition seems superfluous. But all in all, fans of the genre won't be disappointed."
4,EURO-HORROR TRASH THRILLER STILL CASTS WICKED SPELL,"""HORROR EXPRESS"" (1972)Was that a train whistle? Or...something...else?Peter Cushing unearths a huge, frozen, man-like creature in China. It's crated and put on a train for Europe where, surprise, it thaws out and breaks loose.Lucky for us, Cushing is reluctantly paired with rival scientist Christopher Lee (great to see them together even in ""euro-horror trash"") to fight this diabolical creature bent on human destruction.This sometimes bizarre Spanish production is now a cult fave that has fallen into public domain.Look for Image's relatively clean transfer. (Not rated, widescreen, 86 minutes)"
4,This is an underrated Classic,"I remember seeing this movie long ago in my youth. There was something about this film that made me rember it but I wasnt sure the reason. Well after seeing it again after all these years I now know why.This film holds up very well after all this time and features a unique view of horror. The Whitenning of the eyes, the blood from the eyes Etc.Add a very good storyline to an impressive cast Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Telly Savales Etc. and you have a great horror film on your hands. A definite must see."
4,Hidden Gold!,"This is actually a pretty solid piece of horror/sci-fi fare! I wasn't expecting anything decent, man was I pleasantly suprised! The story is solid and intriguing, the cast is large and well rounded, and it features Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in lovely performances. Telly Savalas also turns up in a small but entertaining role!Overall, pretty darn good! Scary, fun, interesting! Check it out!"
4,"A late-night classic, with an erie horror mystism","I first watched this film when I was around 10 years old late one friday on the BBC. Part of a house of horrors season. It was the first I saw of many from this period so has a place. Looks very dated and plastic but has a certain erie mystism that attracts. worth a watch if only to take the pe, but good for this..."
5,GOOD QUALITY(EXCEPT CREDITS),"For the money, this is a good buy. The image quality is very good. The opening and closing credits are another matter. When I first played this and saw the dull and faded credits roll I thought this was going to be unwatchable. After the credits stopped the image quality greatly improved. It seemed the difference between night and day. Another odd thing-there are no credits at the end. The music plays and there is only a black screen. Geneon [Pioneer]"
5,The best of Cushing and Lee's many collaborations,"Horror Express is an excellent film and manages to avoid the cornyness and absurdity that characterize so many of Peter Cushing's and Christopher Lee's movies. Telly Savalas gives a brief yet gripping performance as a Cossack. The soundtrack is excellent and lends a haunting air to the film. John Cacavas, who wrote the score, also scored much of the Kojak television series that began the following year and launched Telly Savalas to the pinnacle of his career."
5,Heartwrenching and Romantic,"What can I say, but I absolutely LOVE this cd. I especially enjoy listening to this cd in the Fall months. I write poetry and fiction novels and Fall is my favorite time to write. This music inspires me and brings out so many feelings and thoughts. I bought their follow-up cd, Blackflowers, and I enjoy it just as well. I have been looking for years, hoping to find a third cd, but have been unsuccessful. I only hope they will share their talents with us once again. Geoff Smith's ability with the piano is amazing, especially with his crossover to classical. Nicola's voice is poetry in itself, amazing."
5,"Deeply beautiful, haunting","This is a great release and one I've enjoyed for over a decade now. Deeply beautiful, haunting tracks throughout. Geoff Smith and Nicola Walker Smith are a powerful, cerebral twosome.What's happened to these two? It's almost as if they've dropped off the face of the earth. I'd love to get my hands on some subsequent releases, but I can't locate them anywhere online. The only thing I've unearthed are a few tracks via iTunes on a release entitled ""Emmerson: Spaces and Places."" There are four tracks on the release that feature Nicola's singing and Geoff's ""live electronics"" as they interpret some of composer Simon Emmerson's work."
1,problems with instant video,"I have both purchased and rented the movie ""The Confession"" (Alec Baldwin). could not find this on your product list so just chose a movie. Nothing I've tried allows me to see this movie past 20:22. It freezes there. I've downloaded it, uninstalled and reinstalled the unbox- to no avail. Please correct this for me. thanks Elaine Zaks"
3,Light duty first aid kit,"The Pocket Doctor first aid kit is for minor scraps and pains. The small size allows keeping it at hand with no concern for weighing down a runner, hiker or biker on short jaunts. Don't substitute this kit for major medical emergencies and accidents with life threatening injuries. A substantial medical kit for family, auto or outdoor adventures should be chosen on recommendations from Red Cross, OSHA or FEMA."
1,FIRST AID KIT,"I DIDNT THINK THIS SMALL FIRST AID KIT WAS WORTH THE MONEY. THE CASE WAS CUTE, BUT THE INSIDE WAS LAME. COULD HAVE FILLED WITH MORE AND BETTER ITEMS."
3,Problems after 1 year,"I have had this sander for more than 1 year. At first I was very happy with it. The main problem was a loose clip for the belt. The belts will slip. BUT!!! Now I can't raise or lower the table. 3 days I have worked on this sander. Trying to adjust the table so the timimg belt won't slip. This happened 6 months ago and I was able to fix it. Now, so far no luck."
1,junk!,"All I can say is I hope you're ready to spend all day setting it up and most of another bolting it to the floor to keep it in one place. I can't sell it without taking a huge loss because I could not dream of telling someone anything good about it. It needs constant attention. I have the one before the ""X"". They say they improved the table height adjustment, I hope so for your sake! I tried to set the speed to use fine grit paper and I could not keep the unit from vibrating right out of the moble base. Oh, then there's the little issue with the drum binding half way through a planed piece of wood, for no apparent reason. I spend more time setting it up and fixing it and the wood it ruins than it was worth. Expensive lesson learned."
2,"Nice concept, but poor performance",I have owned my Delta Sander for several months- bought due to the favorable review in one of my woodworking magazines.Problems:Mechanism to elevate table is flawed. Cog belt constantly slips- I have spent whole days just trying to get table parallel. Table is diffuclt to raise and lower. Called customer service a few times but they were of limited help= suggested I take to service center. At nearly 200 lbs this is somewhat impractical.Motor must be removed to replace cog belt- not a one person job- motor is very heavy.No way to avoid snip.Tool might be good for small jobs- like crafts- but working with even small panel doors leads to disappointing results.I have many delta tools in my shop- love them all except this one.
2,tracking problems,"I have had this sander for 4 years, and the infeed cannot be adjusted to track correctly. I have tried a new belt and every adjustment, talked to delta for support, all to no avail."
5,Very pleased with the 31-255X sander,"I don't understand why others had so many problems with their 31-255X sander it must be the hurry up I just gotta try it out blues. For the slipping timing belt blues it states in the manual: if the handle wheel is difficult to turn then the front right table leveling bolt needs adjusting. I found this to be the exact cure for my sander, once all four leveling bolts were adjusted the front right was readjusted and whammo the wheel turns very smoothly. The loose/destroyed belt blues are most likely the cause of not readjusting the belt after it has been used for awhile and excessive feed rate and cut. The burning blues are most likely the cause of high feed rate when using a very fine grit. I find this sander to be of high quality and sure it will give years of delightful use."
4,Some what Dissapointed,"I have owned this drum sander for about 2 years now and had tremendous problem the 1st week of owning it tring to get the table adjusted level and skippping teeth on the flimsy belt. After a couple of days of adjusting I finaly got it working good and have used it on average about 3 hours a week. It seems to work better (the height adjustment) on warm days, what doesent though. I almost through this thing in the trash today as it skipped a couple of teeth for the 1st time in over a year and spent the next 2 hours readjusting the table so the height adjustment would turn easily. As soon as I can afford it I will be selling this thing and buying another peice of crap from China."
3,GO SLOW WITH THIS SANDER,If you do not go slow with table speed and thin cuts the sander will eat a boatload of sandpaper in a very short time!
2,poorly designed,"This sander is EXPENSIVE but very weak in it's performance. I am truly disapointed in this sander. It looks good but the drum can't keep up with the in-feed belt if it is set for maximum run. The machine's drum binds against the wood being fed into it if there are knots or if the wood is a hard wood. I paid well over $800.00 for what I was told was a great drum sander. I tried to return it the very next day as I found out that first night how poorly this thing performs. Save your money, buy a different brand if you want a machine that sands like it should. Shame on you Delta!"
1,Delta has poor products and no service,"I purchased this item in August of 2004. It broke down in early February of 2005. It has been in the shop for the better part of 4 months waiting on an $11 part. Delta service centers in Auburn and Tacoma WA are snotty and sullen. There is no one at Delta that cares. I will never purchase another Delta, Porter Cable, or Black and Decker product because of the lack of service I have recieved on this unit. My advice is do not waste your money on this product. They break down too fast and no one will work on them or be there to help."
2,so so,I do not own this but I use it very frecuently at my high school.ProblemsTale height adjustment mechinism dose not stay in alingmentmoter is under sizedDrum houseing vibrates a lotend is open not closedthe metal stck on the machine is about 1/8 inch thick and vbibrates. Solution have a closed end use hevy duty cast iron or thick steel to reduce vibration. Change moter to threen or five horse power 220 volt. Make table adjust ment mechanism larger and more bulky not think and skiny like it is currently.[...]
2,Delt Drum Sander,"I too had problems right out of the gate with the table elevation mechanism. I had read the unfavorable reviews but decided to buy anyway based upon Fine Wookworking's favorable review.My machine was improperly set up right out of the box. I spend several very frustrating hours taking the machine apart, properly setting up the indexing belt and adjusting the table mechanism.Once I got everything corrected it works great, but for what I paid, it is extremely frustrating to have to spend hours correcting what was to have been ""factory assembled and adjusted""."
2,She looks tired.,"I guess she says at the beginnning that this is the second to last concert on the Wildflower Tour and it shows. She just looks tired and like she just wants to get the concert over. I LOVE Sheryl Crow and have all her albums and all her videos but this one was a disappointment. The Wildflower album, although I really like it, just isn't really suited for any kind of high energy concert like you might expect from Sheryl. If you really want to see a great video, get her music video DVD. It is absolutely amazing quality but, of course, isn't live. I bought a bunch of those and give it away to my friends along with the Eagles Farewell Tour 1 DVD's (of course, puchased on Amazon). Overall, I would not recommend this one unless you are a die hard Sheryl fan and must have everything."
2,Poor sound quality,I love Sheryl Crow and have all her videos. This is by far my least favorite. The sound quality is poor and she seems to lack enthusiasm. The Sheryl Crow spark is just not there. This is not the concert video to buy unless you have to have all of her videos. The sound stage video is far better if you want a good Sheryl Crow video.
3,Sorry Lay...,"I have been listening to Bone since day one, well before crossroads. So let me make it clear about my should be bias opinion because I am a die hard Bone fan.This album, lacks. Lay has too many guests on this album. Too much ""I am a thug"" advertising which, plauged his first solo but Lay did it with success. Not this time around. I find myself sifting through tracks where he only has one verse or two. The older songs are great, however Lay should have done more to promote his-self and show off his rap/vocal talent a lil more.One major disappointment for me is the lack of song types like ""listen"" and ""As the rain"" Lay shold have dropped more songs like this. This album, to me is a step back and its a shame because it hide a lot of his talent."
1,An Honest Review,"The first problem that I have with this record, and really the only major problem is that it is NOT ORIGINAL! Almost half the songs had been previously released. Why would you spend money on a CD when only have the songs are new, and really only one is worth listening to over and over (thug nation)? Tracks 2, 3, 9, 17 and 19 are all previously released (originally, track 4 had also been do your thang with Kray and Felecia, but later copies were switched to a new song).Second, if you're looking for layzie, this cd is not a good place. 15 of the songs are featuring some rapper or another, while the intro and outro and skit are not real songs, leaving two songs with just layzie.Sorry layzie, but when a rapper is struggling to keep fans or get back into the mainstream, this [...] is not the right way. I will have to think twice before buying any more bone thugs stuff (except Bizzy!).God Bless"
2,much luv to mo' thugs,"to be real its not a cd worth buying out the store. the beats are to watered down for a real thug. ""real talk from a real listener of hardcore rap."""
2,It's Not a Good Album Either...,The only reason why this cd gets more than 1 star is because anybody that puts krayzie bone on their album is doing something right. Production is atrocious and don't blame that on a lack of funds cause krayzie put out one the hottest cd's of the year and he got no support from his label. Coincidentally the best songs on bone brothers were the tracks with krayzie on them. If this is the best layzie bone has to offer then he better keep his input out of the new bone cd cause this s**t is garbage.
3,it's a game aka a joke hahahah!,"1st off this was a mix tape that's why you here some old songs in unreleas songs some new and it's also pop the only tight songs on it is thats new is 5,15,16,18 thats it ""THUG WORLD OVER PIECE!""."
2,Good start with a really Bad ending,"Although this book is a real page turner the ending makes the book not worth reading. All of Alice's running around town and insomniac nights were exhausting to read knowing that she was 6 moths pregnant with twins. A bit odd that Alice would mind someone smoking a cigarette in front of her when she is so passive about her own health and welfare of the children she is carrying. The book isn't really a who dunnit, but a who cares by time you get through the last page.Also The endless details of people's houses and furnishings became a little annoying as the book went on. The descriptions of the children playing with their toys every other page was just as annoying."
3,Don't judge the author by this book,"I bought this book after reading the amazing five days in summer, here she lies and one cold night - all very well written, suspenseful novels. I started with this info because IMO, seven minutes to noon is nothing like the books that made me fall in love with this author. It started off okay, got thoroughly depressing, then picked up slightly. Yet by two thirds through, the plot was all over the place - and the final parts seemed quite unlikely. Parts of the story were left hanging with no further explanation and the conclusion - left no real conclusion at all. If you start with this book, my recommendation is to not judge the author by this book alone. Her other books are fantastic. If you already read one or two others, you may just want to skip this. It may leave you more frustrated than satisfied. I gave it a three since the story itself was a bummer, but again - I do like this author!"
2,Screeching halt,"After such a great buildup,I began feeling totally lost due to way too many characters in the final chapters. It became not only totally distracting and frustrating but all the suspense accomplished to that point was getting lost.Alice's life was so congested with constant interaction with friends and police by the end I never really felt she was in any danger.."
2,Tries too hard....,"I bought this book because I grew up in Brooklyn and thought the author did a terrific job of getting the locale and the residents down right. However, the writing was laborious to me, all the different/relationships. It ook forever to get ""into"" the action, even if you knew what was coming. I was so tired in Part I that I skipped Pt. 2 and moved right into Pts. 3&4 ands never missed the plot. I think the ending was interesting, although convoluted. Pepper seems to be overreaching is putting out her story. Maybe she should stay in Cobble Hill and just write a period piece or a morality fable about the yuppies. Stright out that would work on its own."
3,Seven Minutes To Noon,This book was a bit slow for my liking. I like thrilllers and who done-its with a bit of pace
4,Very Decent,"I have never taken any education related courses prior to buying this book. I am currently enrolled in an online altern program that is set to begin in the Fall.This book helped me pass the test. Not a highly impressive score(258)but I did pass and I guess that's what matters.Although it was helpful, I wasn't entirely impressed with the book. I am sure that there are better books out there but then again I did pass on my first try with no prior educational background.I would recommend buying this book as a supplement to other books that you may have. I would also recommend really focusing on the English portion of the study guides."
5,Extremely helpful,"I am very glad I bought this book. This was all I needed to pass the EC-4 on the first try. I don't know how it compares to other review books since this is all I had, but it helped me."
2,don't think this is all you need,"I took a quick alternative cert. route to getting my teacher certificate and unfortunately the school I went to did not do much to prepare me for the test at all. I had to figure out some things on my own. First off, I took the ec-6 since the ec-4 is going away. There is only one study guide out for ec-6 since it is so new, so it makes it difficult to prepare. I didn't purchase it because the review it has gotten said it had a ton of errors in it. Anyway... I failed the test TWICE both times by just three points. The first time I took it I bought the Preparing to Teach by Nath first and didn't pass so I bought this for next time I took it. This guide is okay but there were was so much info on the test that was not in this guide or the other one. I don't know what the answer is, but don't expect that this is all you need and you'll be good to go.It's not!"
3,okay,"I had to choose between this and another book as I prepared for the bilingual generalist EC-4. I figured that this book would be the best source for reviewing all of the non-bilingual domains. As I studied, I really felt like some of the information presented was not really specific to the competency. I ended up ordering another study prep that included the bilingual portion and really preferred the layout and information of the other book. I haven't taken my exam yet but hopefully all of this money and time will be worth it!"
2,Adequate,The book is a little confusing and I didn't pass my exam. I purchased another manual and it hepled me more and enough to understand this manual. I like the questions more than the exam in the book.
2,Not For Me,"Most of the people I work with really liked these, however I didn't. I would suggest that you try them for yourself."
3,ok but tiny pieces,good flavor but apples were a bit stale and pieces were tiny crumb like... too expensive for crumbs.
4,Good,"These dried fruits are excellent. Toss them on yogurt, cereal or just eat 'em the way I prefer, straight out of the packet. Good quality. Perfect for little snackers like my 2-1/2 year old. I would've liked them even more if there was just a little less apple in this particular mix, but still excellent."
5,excellent story of faith for all ages,Hinds Feet On High Places is an allegory about Much Afraid who longs to go to the High Places but is so afraid. She belongs to the Great Shepherd who comes always when she calls and plants the seed of love in her heart. Well worth taking this journey to the High Places with Much Afraid and her companions.
5,This is wonderful,"This is a great story to help us understand our walk with God, the ups, downs, struggles, and high points in an enjoyable story that is easy to read. loved it. great for new christians also."
4,Hinds' Feet excellant!,Hinds' feet could be anyone's story. I find it a beautiful expression of find self-hood. This is my second copy because I wanted to pass it on.
5,Encouraging,I first read this book when I was going through a difficult time. The book helped get my perspective right. It helped me look beyond the problems and focus on the reward that is sure to come when you have made your walk with God without turning back.
4,a good book,"Overall when I finished reading I was pleased with it, but I noticed when reading that at times there were sentences that just didn't make sense, and I suggest looking up the verse in Habbakuk and form a definition in your mind of what ""hinds feet"" are before you read the book. The story is encouraging and reminices one of Pilgrim's Progress. It moves very quickly and one rarely is bogged down. One identifies with Much-Afraid from their own life."
5,Wonderful,"This is my all time favorite book. I read it whenever I'm going through a difficult season and need some comfort, an escape, and a reminder that life is a series of lessons. Hannah Hurnard has an impeccable allegory in this story, which is apparently closely related to her life. I also recommend her autobiography ""Hearing Heart"" which parallels her personal character with the character of Much Afraid in this book."
4,A Comforting Book,"This is an extended allegory taken from Habakkuk 3:19 about God making one's feet like hind's feet in overcoming difficulties in life. The author talks about observing the animals in action for herself and discovering that ""their motion was one of the most beautiful examples of exultant and apparently effortless ease in surmounting obstacles which I have ever seen."" The reference to hind's feet is also found in Psalms 18:33.The first chapter starts with an invitation to the high places. It is in the concluding few chapters that she reconnects back to the book's primary theme. Numerous Christians have been encouraged by this book and chances are you will be too."
5,Really good allegory.,"Good book. Great allegory, even better story line to follow. Recommend it for any teenage girl."
5,hinds feet,"Hind's Feet on high places is an excellent spiritual book and after the Bible, the book most true to life that I have ever read. This particular version in hard cover is very nice.I would strongly recommend this book for any Christian trying to grow spiritually."
5,Hind's Feet on High Places,The book arrived in perfect condition. I'd buy from this seller again.Thank you.
5,"Simply, a classic.","I have read this book a number of times over the years and each time, it touches my heart. The images of the Good Shepherd are totally inspiring, helping us to see Jesus and his nature. And who among us has not been Much Afraid? If you have never read this, I encourage you to broaden your literary knowledge. If you have read this before, I think it's time you did again."
3,Much-Afraids preachy journey,"This book is good and solid, but tends to turn to being overly preachy and tends to lose my interest. It's slow moving but eventually fulfilling."
1,Sent wrong prodcut,"I thought I was purchasing Hinds Feet On High Places the book - hardback. However, I was sent a small devotional. The product description says nothing about a devotional!!!"
1,positive experience with return,I have to say I had a very positive experience with the seller of this book as I needed to return it. They were very friendly and gracious and I felt that I was treated with great care!
1,Christian Buddhism!,"I was very saddened to hear how popular New Age Theology from Hannah Hurnard is being promoted within the church. She teaches an open rejection of the Gospel, Necromancy, Universalism, Pantheism, Reincarnation, etc.... Her final book The Inner Man is possibly a bit hard to find, but is the fullest accounting of her nonChristian heresy. Christians should not read or support New Age theology nomatter how good it may sound! Sometimes the more wormy the theology the more ""godly"" we think it is. It's sad because Scripture is all about the victory we have in Jesus. As a student of Philosophy, World Religions and Theology, I have been studying the Buddhistic influence within Christian mysticism today, and Hannah appears to be one of the front people in its promotion. Please avoid this book and find true sanctification through faith and worship of Jesus Christ, not Buddhism. A skunkweed by any other name, still stinks."
1,Not what I ordered,"I was under the impression I was ordering The children's illustrated copy of Hinds Feet In High Places in great condition. But to my surprise and horror, when I received my order, it was a old, torn, awful condition, original ADULT version of the story. Not at all matching with the picture or the order description. Very disappointed to say the least!"
5,More than a 5 star!,This book is a life-changer! If I could I would give more than a 5 star rating! The insights pierce straight into the heart of humankind! Anyone who reads this book will see themselves in one character or another and discover the way to live life with The Great Shepherd on the heights and in the valleys!
4,Hinds feet on High Places,"Hinds Feet on High Places is an alegory. Any one who has ever been faced with a difficult journey can relate to this tale, but I think it is particularly helpful to those of us who have been overwhelmed by fear, depression or self doubt. I highly recomend this book. My only reservation is that this specific edition is oversized like a children's book. I have an old and well worn paperback from years ago. I wanted to loan it to a friend who is suffering from depression but mine is falling apart. I ordered this from Amazon, not paying enough attention to the specifications and was surprised when it arrived (my mistake to be sure)."
3,"Great Book, Flawed Performance","Note: This review applies only to the abridged audio version read by Flo Schmidt.Hannah Hurnard's book has long held a special place in my heart. It's a sensitive parable of the life of faith, full of the Shepherd's love. Unfortunately, Flo Schmidt's narration trivializes the book. The reading is badly overacted, giving the parable the quality of a melodrama. The reader seems to believe that we won't figure out what to feel about the story unless the emotions are hammered into us.My recommendation: find an audio performance by a different narrator or stick with the print version."
4,Excellent read,This book is written with wisdom and sensitivity . It is encouraging as it parallels our lives so closely. It is a must read.
5,Hind's Feet on High Places (Deluxe Christian Classics),I thought this book was very good. It willl help you to see how important love is and how important it is to love others.
5,Great item and transaction,Thank you again Amazon...I have yet to be disappointed in the various items purchased on your site...and this is one of the best.
5,Hinds Feet on High Places,I really like this book and am looking forward to reading it! I t has so much helpful information!
1,Problem with this book's message,"I really am questioning the focus on physical beauty in this book. Everyone unkind is ugly and everyone strives to be kind/beautiful. I am hoping that this means inner beauty, but that is not pointed out anywhere. We are always told that what matters is inside ourselves, but I certainly couldn't tell from this book!Can anyone respond to this? I have wondered about it for a long, long time. People seem to think this book is so wonderful, but I really would like input from others. Thanks!"
1,Not great - not even good,"Not a good read - it does not work as a story and is very weak as an allegory. I find it hard to believe so many have found it worthwhile reading. The theology is more than a little questionable; it is not surprising to find out that the author drifted away from Christianity into spiritualism and New-Agey philosophy.I read this book thirty years ago and disliked it then; my opinion has not been changed. If you are looking for a good allegorical work I suggest ""Pilgrim's Progress"" (John Bunyon) or ""The Great Divorce"" (C.S. Lewis)."
2,Tough Reading,"The main character, Much Afraid, is having a tough journey to Christ. She has a lot of setbacks and disappointments.I know this is suppose to be encouragement - and I know this is how it really is - but I was so discouraged and depressed while reading this. It was really hard for me to read. It wasn't the upbeat Christian book that I prefer."
3,Great finale if you can stick around for it.,"This movie starts out really slow, but if you are patient, you will be well rewarded. (By the way, do not confuse this with ""Dragon Lord"" which is a later film which Jackie directed himself). This is a typical Lo Wei film, with the typical avenge-the-death-of-my-master plot. I paid $4 bucks for this film at my local movie store, and if I had just fast-forwarded to the final fight scene, I would have more than gotten my money's worth! However, the movie wasn't that bad, and actually there are several decent fight scenes throughout it. If you like these old costume Kung-Fu films, then this one is worth a look. Oh, one other thing--the end of this is REALLY BLOODY, at least for a Jackie Chan film, so be warned."
2,?,"Dragon Fist was yet another attempt by Lo Wei to mold Jackie in the likeness of Bruce Lee. The film was a box office bomb despite some very exiting fight scenes, including the final confrontation between Jackie and the Wei Clan thugs."
5,"Forceful, empowered, and energetic.","Never has a score had more energy and ""life"" in its compositions than that of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, composed by Patrick Doyle. His use of many instruments at once to create a feeling of hurried tension is astounding, and, combined with the nonstop moving of the camera, keeps the action moving. The ever-present love theme, which is based on Byron's ""So we'll go no more a roving"" poem, is heard in its entire in track twenty-one, entitled ""The Wedding Night."" This, above all others, will sweep you into the true emotional power of the film, allowing you to experience the feelings of the characters as well as the horror of the story itself. While some tracks called for a smaller orchestra, others, such as ""Elizabeth"" and ""The Montser"" required a full assembly. Totally moving and very forceful, this is a must for any soundtrack buff's collection, as well as fans of the 1994 film."
5,Big and Majestic,"Patrick Doyle is one of the most overlooked film composers working today. He regularly produces music of such majesty and breadth, such as this 1994 score for the Kenneth Branagh film. As with any great film score, the music works well both on-screen and as a stand-alone piece."
4,Excellent,This definately a must buy for all people who are fans of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The music is dark and foreboding and is a perfect complement to the classic novel. For all you people who may have seen Thousand Oaks Highschool's 1998 Winter Drumline then you understand dark music. This is one of those CD's who would blow the Dracula music out of the water.
5,Great Product,"I found out from my running friend that I must have this stick. I purchased it and lent it to my co worker because his wife had some pain in her legs. She loved it and purchased it right away. Then another marathoner friend at work wanted to try it, so I lent it to her and she loved it so much....she didn't give it back. I just got your review form to remind me of my purchase and will need to buy another one! It's been great for everyone at my company. Try it!"
3,It does what I expected,"The stick is a great size. Not too big or too small. Sometimes seems a little too flexible, but I'm probably pressing too hard. It's good for knots that I can get rid of with stretching."
5,greatest massage tool ever made!,"I stumble across this in a running store in Bozeman,MT. have since puchased several for friends, have recommended it to several others, and now my gym will probably start carrying it! For anyone with tight leg muscles, this rocks. Especially for those that suffer from ITB (ileo-tibial band) syndrome. It almost gets my muscles as well as my $60 per session physical therapy."
4,massage therapist,"the stick marathon stick body muscle massager has been a useful tool in the office. the larger client, the body builder client and alot in between has benefitted from a treatment from the tool. Much easier on the therapist too."
5,the stick,The Stick Marathon StickI first saw this product when working out with a trainer. He was using it on himself after a strenous workout. We talked about it and I had to get myself one to workout the kinks.
4,Good but different from the old one!,"Good stick. I own an old one until today. I bought this one for my dad. The newer one seems to be softer. I like older one better, it's tougher."
5,The Stick,My physically therapist used on my leg which was the turning point to my recovery. It helped breakdown knots in leg giving long needed relief. Awesome!
3,The Instructor,"What can I say, either you're nuts for anything related to the martial arts or you know the cast. I bought it because I know most the cast and live in the city where it was shot 8-)."
4,Good Beginner Book,This book is a great book for those just beginning in the consulting field. The content is very helpful and credible because Hubert Bermont is a successful consultant himself. Bermont's main objective is how to be able to cash in on your own experience rather than work for someone else. I think this is good advice for those interested in external consulting because you must learn through your own experiences and mistakes in order to be succssful. This book is easy to read and understand and I would definitely recommend buying this book and using it to your advantage!
4,Helps give you direction,I think that this book helps you choose and succeed at any type of consulting career you choose. A complementary resource I found was Vaultreports.com which helps you land a great job once having chosen your career.
5,Book on consulting,"With the downturn, which affected me in April, I became involved in consulting in my industry. This book is the best I found in the library so I purchased a copy. Great read and good advice, some of which is happening as Hubert said it would. From a pro and a guy I want to be like."
3,I was disappointed,"While this book does have some good information, overall I was disappointed. I found most of the information general and for a book that's in it's 3rd edition, I didn't expect to read about typewriters! What I did appreciate was the author certaintly has his own way of doing things - and the advice he offers is solid and practical, something you don't often find in other books. Just the fact that he has no financial debt makes it advice worthy. If I had to do it over, I'd read it in the library or B & N."
4,It's a great book to learn the life of the Mitford Family,If you like reading auto-biographical books or finding out more juicy gossip about the Mitford Family you would like this book. I personally thought it was a great book but a bit lacking in backgrund of the other Mitford's. I suggest that if you will like to read some information on The Mitford Family you should read Nacy Mitfords' The Pursuit of Love and Love In A Cold Climate.
3,Sydney Prevails,"I kept wondering why anyone would want to read a biography of any one of these women. Together, they make an interesting family. However, Sydney, the mother, is the best Mitford by far.Through all her children's wild political workings, living withher husband's gruff demeanor, and living through her son's death in the war, she sails gracefully on, always there for her children and having a few wild politics of her own. I did feel that I knew each one of them so I'll give the author that."
1,Not that interesting,"Yes, these sisters are all rich and/or famous, but I found it very hard to care. Maybe because I found them boring. I'm too old to care about Paris Hilton and too young to find the era these sisters lived in very interesting."
4,The Mitfords,"A very interesting read that reflects the social context of WWII in Europe, its devastation, its politics. The characters carry the story and reflect the family disfunction that escalates as the war changes everything, and the English upper classes lose their raison d'etre and either move on or stagnate. At times Lovell seems to overly defend her characters' bad behavior; maybe she has fallen in love, just a bit, with her subjects. There are some distracting sentence structure errors in the prose, but generally it moves along smoothy; highly sensory background description sets each individual scene.All in all the extensive research backs up the characters, bizarre as they sometimes may seem. War, love, and polemic ideals come together to give the reader a fast- moving and very compelling reading experience."
4,Thank your stars you weren't the parents of this crew,"Mary S. Lovell's biography of the famous, infamous, and infinitely interesting Mitford sisters is a truly engaging book. 'Those crazy Mitford girls' is how they were known during their heyday, and this book will prolong and perpetuate that sobriquet. There were 6 of them, plus one handsome and doted-upon male sibling who went and got himself killed during the war, leaving the road clear for the girls to completely dominate. Lovell succeeds in making each girl unique for us, so we don?t get them confused, a real feat with so many characters. The Mitford sisters obliged, however, and made Lovell's task easier by being 6 entirely different personalities. It seems the only thing they had in common was good looks. They ranged from Fascist Hitler-lovers (Diana) to communists (Jessica). The story of their lives spans the 20th century and is well worth the read on many levels. Just pity the Mitford sisters long-suffering parents."
4,What a dramatic family,I have always been interested in this family and found The Sisters: The Saga of the Mitford Family most informative and easy to read.Denise Godfrey
3,"Fascinating subject, wish there was more about Unity.","I've wanted to read a book about the Mitford sisters for a while, as they were such colorful characters, and the political dichotomies in their family are nothing short of fascinating. But I felt like the book was heavier on some sisters than others, and in particular I wish there had been more information about Unity. I'm surprised there hasn't been an indepth modern biography written about her yet."
3,Fascinating but flawed,"The Mitford family is of course a compelling topic, and as a result Lovell's book grabs the reader from Page One. The author does a commendable good job of sorting out fact from fiction. But why on earth has she let Diana and Oswald Mosley and Unity Mitford off so easily? She accepts the Mosleys' excuses for their horrific beliefs -- ""We weren't really anti-Semitic and racist; we were just looking out for England's best interest."" And Unity -- well, the poor dear was prone to obsession, and Hitler was just another of her hobbies. Yet Decca and Esmond take a beating for the heinous crime of... eloping? What gives?"
2,You've read this before,"If you've read even one book about the Mitford family, you've read this book before. It relies heavily on Jessica Mitford's HONS AND REBELS; THE HOUSE OF MITFORD, by Jonathan & Catherine Guinness, and, Nancy Mitford's novels. The author merely borrows fact (or fictionalized fact) and conclusions from other authors, and sets them forth yet again, in this waste-of-time effort.I wanted NEW insights into this family, and all I found was repetition. I appreciate when a biographer allows me to draw my own conclusions, but there should be times when an author's feelings come forward about the subject(s). In other words, the reader should have some sense of where the author stands. In this case, I think the author was too concerned about not causing offense to the Duchess of Devonshire and Lady Mosley, who gave her assistance. This multi-biography provides nothing fresh or revelatory about the Mitford family.Very disappointed in this and very glad I only borrowed it from the library."
3,Cool!,"I own this movie and bought it because I'm a snake lover and will watch any movie or program with snakes in it! This movie was good. It's about a small town that gets invaded by very deadly genetically altered snakes. Once bitten, the victims die very quickly. Things get so bad that the army is sent to quarantine both the surviving victims and the snakes themselves. With the virus spreading so quickly, the race is on to save lives. Good suspense film. Cool snakes. A good movie to watch even though rated PG-13 and not being a horror movie. Good movie for snake lovers to watch also. I'd recommend renting this film if you haven't seen it yet. It's worth it."
2,Scary not really !?,"well i really wasn't expecting much , definely a D- movie good in spots but never a great one at that . the effects are cool in places , but if you're looking for a real horror movie then go somewhere else the actress that plays the doctor so much more capable of better roles then this sorry one, i wish they would have spend more time on it,starts off cool then loses steam.P.S. if you just want to see snakes moving around then rent it."
5,by far the best book on the overviews of economic thoughts by school,"If you are interested in the essence of economic schools of thoughts, this is the book to get.There are many macroeconomics books that teaches what the mainstream macroeconomcs is. This book tells you how the each school is different from others. I would say one should have read or studied ordinary macroeconomics book before reading this book though.It is not math heavy and only requires macroeconomic 101 knowledge to read through. There are not many books that explains economic thoughts by school and Snowdon does it superbly."
3,Its OK.. but just barely,"I was pretty disappointed with this Album. I had heard a couple of their songs on a internet radio station and really liked them but this CD doesnt have any of those songs - and in general the music on it is uninspired and not nearly as good as the stuff I heard previously.Sadly, I don't know what the names of those songs were nor do I know what CD they are on.Hopefully their future efforts will provide a better listening experience."
5,Accessory kit bundle for Samsung wireless phone,This was just as I expected and everything I could possibly need for my phone. The delivery was very fast also. I received my product in 2 days with ordinary delivery.
2,Overwhelming,"Correspondence is an important property of witchcraft, but this book just throws a lot of information at you and you don't ever really get explanations for some of it. I would rather have to work on finding my own, and be able to see the relationships. If you like lots and lots of lists, and want your Book of Shadows planned out for you, this book might be for you."
4,Great Book,Book is just as described and arrived in good time. I would purchase from this seller again!!
1,Maybe okay for the beginner,"I received this as a gift. Full of dumb hocus-pocus, no real substance, and no index. Not that the ideas are bad, but the executions are overly dramatic. And remember, the only spells that work are those you write yourself."
5,Awesome reference book,"This is a HUGE book, FULL of good information. It's a reference book, though, so you'll need to understand witchcraft/wicca before you can make heads or tails of the information in this book. I find myself refering to this book again and again. Moura presents Sigils, Plantary Squares & Seals, a whole bunch of spells and recipes, a LOT of general and specific Symbolisms, and great sections on Tarot, Scrying, Ogham & Palmistry, among other things. She even has Pagan versions of Xmas Carols...I rolled my eyes about that at first, but now I think it's a pretty cool thing to include.You can basically look up anything you need in this book. Highly recommended."
4,Good book.,"This is a great source of knowledge for any pagan or Wiccan. The information has obviously been passed down for many generations. Four stars for that.However, the ""greenness"" of this grimoir, in comparison to other grimoirs is questionable. Of course it is green, in that the author rights about an ""Earth Based"" religion, but I was expecting more information on working with and caring for nature and plants."
3,Not for beginners,"This book is divided into two sections; each section is divided into ""parts"" and there is no index.I had a little trouble getting started on this book, I had to take a break from it several times before I was able to get through the first section which seems to have a ""do it this way"" feel that I didn't care for however this may just be my impression and some readers may like that approach. Also the book doesn't have the ""nature lover"" or ""tree hugger"" feel that I expected from the title, but this is neither good nor bad.The second section contains a wealth of information that in my opinion makes the book worth the price; however I was unable to determine what rune set she has used. It does not seem to be the ""Elder Futhark"" or Germanic runes that is most commonly used, nor does it appear to be Danish runes, Swedish-Norse runes, Angle-Saxon runes, or Seax-Wica runes. She has used short name or abbreviations for some runes, and may simply have listed them in an unfamiliar order."
4,beautiful book,I love this book.. its beautiful.. i use it whenever i can. I am very happy with this book. Has many spells and info you could possably need
5,Soul of Spain CD,"I origianlly had this as a 33 1/3 album in 1961. I loved it. Gave the album to a used record shop when i downsized to move 6 yrs ago - had to :(Recently, when I searched for it on line, I was delighted to see it available. It's in good condition and the music is as invigorating as ever! Good listening!"
4,Don't drive without it! A necessity today:,"A prior reviewer, erroniously indicated that the MICROPHONE is in the 'speaker'. This is not correct. The MIC is that little rectangular box UNDER the connector that goes into the phone. I had an older handsfree MICROPHONE on my sun visor, and I used an adaptor plug to change from 1/8-inch to 2.5-mm plug required. I would ONLY recommend this item with the EXTERNAL MIC. It works GREATS. The speaker has a 3-watt amp that more often than not I have to turn down the volume. The unit also is relatively small in size and really not visable if you were to look into the car's windows from outside. For SAFETY, this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, just don't forget that you are really DRIVING a car at the SAME TIME you are trying to carry on a conversation!"
3,You want full duplex? Buy something else.,"Ok, when I got this, I just assumed it was full duplex. I dont' care what any body or any specs say. I turned on the car radio, connect my cell to the kit, called my cell with my home cordless phone, and talked into it. The radio music noticeably disappears when I speak.This is not a real hassle if you're sitting there in your car still and talking to friends. But if you're driving, your friends will not hear the ""driving hissing sound"" when they're talking to you. They feel like they're talking to nobody, then they either complain or ask. I have a 528, and it's quiet inside - but at 75 MPH, there's bound to be some whitenoise when you're talking.I bought the external mic too. It is WAAAY too overpowered. I finally cut the mic, and attached a PC mic. Worked a lot better, and then realized this kit wasn't full duplex. Why is it so hard to make it full duplex? What is wrong with motorola?"
2,Bad sound,"It is nice that it recharges the phone, while you talk. However, most people cannot understand what I say. The sound coming from the speakerphone is reasonable.The adhesive is not great quality, and has come out several times. I wish I could return this ""White elephant"""
2,half a speaker phone,"Convenient and a good speaker, but the built in mic is poor and without rigging up some special way of positioning the phone so the mic is near you, there is difficulty being heard. An external mic works well, but defeats the purpose of the product."
4,Great for strength training,"This is the best log I have come across for recording my strength training workouts. However, I have to give this log 4 stars rather than 5 because there is very little room to record aerobic activities (just small blanks to record the type of activity, time, and intensity). I also find myself using post-its rather than the comments section whenever I want to write down extra info because the comments section is too small."
5,Great Workout Log Book!,"I just finished using my Ultimate workout log book and needed to try a different one. I saw thisone on-line and read up on it. After using it only two days, I've decided it is way better thanmy old one and has all the info space you need to log your workout sessions. I give it a solid 9 outof 10"
5,Awesome Workout Log!,"This is the best workout log ever! Very easy to use keeps my workouts organized. A couple pages to write your measurements arms,neck,chest..ect. so you can see your gains. I really like it alot and is well made. Also has nice charts of body muscles and just good info inside the first few pages. If you are a hardcore workout guy or women get this book today! You will love it!"
5,Love It!,"I am starting to concentrate on strength training and this book is great! I love how easy it is to track and there are no advertisements - just simple. It gives an example of how to log and use the book in the front. In the back it has a male with muscle groups shown in an image - it'd be nice to see a female one also.But, no frills - this book has what you need - blank pages to log."
5,Outstanding,Very easy to use. It has a great layout and doesn't waste a lot of pages with useless front matter. The laminated front and back plus the spiral bound pages make this log very durable. Highly recommended!
5,Excellent Workout Log,"I couldn't have chosen a better, manual workout log to use. I'll be waiting for an electronic version, though. (smile)"
4,A Plumbers Review,Strait forward and simple to use without all the filler material you find in other journals. I only used it for a short while until I got an IPhone and the iFitness app. Now I use my Iphone exclusively. If you have an Iphone I recommend that app.
5,Best workout log I've seen yet.,"If you're serious about going to the gym and getting in shape then The Workout Log by Joe Oliver & Kel Gleason is an essential tool to keep you motivated and on track. The book is durable and spiral bound and can take the abuse of being in your gym bag. There are 180 pages where you can enter in up to 15 different exercises with subdivisions of reps/weight used for up to six sets. This is perfect for the novice or the advanced gym enthusiast. Also on the top of the page there is space for recording your aerobic activity, time and level. Finally there is a small section on the bottom for comments. The bottom line is that this book is simple, durable, and keeps you focused. What the book does not do is get you're lazy butt in the gym....you need to do that on your own. :-)"
5,"Love this journal, don't know what I'd do without.","Love it. Everything you need to easily record your lifts. If you don't have a workout journal, get one and get this one. This has helped me so much to keep track of where I'm at and most importantly push past my current lift weights.I may have just lost my workout journal, and it's almost devastating."
5,Been using this log for 3 years,"I'm on my 5th or 6th log and have been using this one for the past 3 years. I love the simplicity and layout of this log. After trying a couple of different ones I have finally found the one I'll use forever. Or until it's discontinued. There are no ""fillers"" in this book like motivation quotes, etc. It's the perfect size to carry around the gym with and keep in my bag. I've turned a few of my weight lifting friends onto this one as well."
2,Not too happy.,Its nice but a bit big. Hard to carry around during exercise. Wish I had just used a small note taking booklet.
2,"Weak writing style, short on content.","I bought this book so that I could get an in-depth understanding of churn, but what I found instead was a fifth-grade level writing style (like the ""Dummies"" books) that took basic concepts that could be written in one sentence and stretched them across many pages. This book focuses more on the various business tactics that are needed to run a business well, and little attention to the math that factors into the churn calculations. I'm trying to implement churn analysis at my company, and this isn't helping as much as I expected it to."
5,Very well done,"This is an excellent book for armored enthusiasts and modelers. There were 19 different versions of this WW2 German track which fought on every front of the war. The narrative is just enough to let you know a brief history, the developments and uses of each version.Most carried infantry into battle (Panzergrenadiers). There were never enough of these armored tracks, engineer, communication, ambulance, command, anti-tank, flame thrower are just some of the uses. 2 pages of color drawings demonstrate common camouflage patterns. There is a more detailed in depth book ""Schutzenpanzer"" by Bruce Culvert, but that will set you back about $50.00. This book gives you many excellent black and white photos, line drawings and helpful captions. This is definitely a worthwhile addition to your collection."
2,NOT all for me,"One song, ""Pressing My Way"" was the only one for me on this CD. Kind of disappointing."
3,Just Okay,"For years I've owned and loved Bass Weejuns, the signature penny loafer. I bought these shoes because they were around $50, thinking they were an inexpensive answer to the Weejun. In fact they are the inexpensive answer to the Weejun, but frankly I'd rather spend more to get the real thing. The leather used for the shoe upper is rather thin and the sole is flat as a pancake, offering zero support. As usual, another example of how you generally get what you pay for."
5,"Impressive, well-argued book","This is an impressive book on the nature of hell. Kvanvig argues that a strong retributivist view of hell is false, and argues instead for an issuant conception of hell, where hell exists because of God's love for us. Kvanvig's basic view is that God values our freedom, and while God could force those who reject God to be in heaven, God would have to violate their freedom to do so. Instead, hell exists for those whose characters are such that they've chosen not to be with God.Kvanvig is a Christian, and while he sometimes discusses hell from a Christian perspective in the book, he's careful to give a more general discussion that applies to non-Christian theologies as well. The book is well-written and carefully argued; it's really an intellectual delight to read."
5,Another Herge masterpiece,"This is a classic chapter in Tintin's life - or more to the point: Captain Haddock's life, for his relationship with Castafiore is explored over the main plot - a mystery surrounding her lost jewels. The artwork is, as always, superb and the subtleties endless. The disillusioned accompanist is a great touch, and we can share the Haddock's discomfort at having to spend countless days in his once peaceful abode, at the mercy of Castafiore's shrill voice. It's great to go back to the original French versions - though the English translations are fine, noone can fully replicate the original intention of Herge, the master."
2,Not worth finishing,"I hate to be negative about books, but over the last few years I have started a bunch of books and not finished about 10% of them.Its sort of like...""who cares, why go on?""I read half of the book. The craftsmanship is not bad. But it became a chore to continue as I was not interested in the characters, plot and essentially nothing happens in the book. It may be me, but at 12AM last night I closed the book and put in on my book shelves and started another book...if anyone would like to discuss why this book is better than I say..please email me...."
5,Great price,Love Loverboy. This CD has all the hits and is offered at a great price. Received promptly by mail. Thank you.
3,Good But Carefull,Including Mike's weak duet with Ann Wilson of Heart ( by far a stronger vocilist then you Mike...so let her shine ...next time ) can't be right...Were the heck is Strike Zone....one of their best songs on their last origianal run albums..Still very good...but definitly misses in some key areas!
4,... Brought Back Memories ...,I purchased this CD because Loverboy used to be my favorite band when I was a young girl and had a huge crush on Mike Reno!!! It`s a nice CD to take me back in time and enjoy!!! ;)
5,good music,great songs that bring back good memories of a younger me. I do miss those good times. very enjoyable to listen to
5,Quality Purchase,"I got this CD because I had a cassette that was going fast and it is awesome. Delivery was fast too, got in in a couple of days. I will be back for more!"
3,Where is Queen of the Broken Hearts ??????????,"Once again the person in charge of picking the songs on a ""Greatest Hits"" collection makes the unforgivable, stupid, totally ridiculous move of leaving off Loverboy's best song (and a BIG HIT!!!) Queen of the Broken Hearts - as a result you cannot get all of their best songs on one collection -- SHAME!!!! SHAME!!!!"
5,Growling and prowling and scowling,"I discovered this gem at a used bookstore and bought it for my toddler twins. We fell in love with it at the first reading. The premise is ingenious. A large and growly bear wakes up one morning and decides to find someone to frighten. All of the animals he encounters are too busy to be frightened, but the bear does manage to frighten himself. This book has a lot of repetition, which aids in language development, and it employs many poetic devices. In addition, having such distinct characters makes for good voice-changing possibilities (and we parents know that for a toddler, voice-changing=interesting.) The best adjective I can think of to describe this book is transcendent. Skip the lame, uninspired new children's books and scour the used bookstores for this gem."
4,Daughter loved this book!,My daughter is 24 and remembers this from when she was little. I wish the Large and Growly Bear would get published again for my grandchildren. The little bear trying to scare everyone in the forest would get a new generation of children to love him.
3,Reprint of two older books,"This is a great book if you don't previously have the two books that are compiled here. I did have the two books and was disappointed that the description did not say that this was a compilation of the two brain ship books about Carialle and Keff. Therefore, I am returning the book."
4,"Good, but REPRINTS","I agree with the reviews. These two novels are great additions to the BrainShips series, but Amazon SHOULD INFORM when some book advertised as new is merely a reprint. It happens all too often with many popular writers. I would hate to buy a supposedly ""new"" story and find out it was one I had already read. Norma."
2,"Sorry, I agree with everyone else...","I bought this book, not realizing that It was just a re-hash of her old books.I noticed that the publisher is doing this with a LOT of McCaffrey's books. I had added these on my wishlist before they were published, because it *looked* like they were new stories. Too bad. I should have waited for the synopsis."
1,"Boy, thanks for delays and customer reviews.","I bought this book for our collection, and was sent a ""shipment delayed"" notice by Amazon. Lucky for me. When I came back over I saw the two other customer reviews indicating that it is just a compilation of two old novels. Thanks to these customers for informing me of this so I could cancel this order instead of having to send it back."
4,Response to various reviews,"I have to laugh at how many people are apparently buying books because they have the nice and shiny 'new' label on them without taking the time to find out what the book is about. A little consumer sense instead of consuming instinct would probably serve _all_ consumers in good stead.As for me, I'm looking forward to getting a chance to read some books I missed out on their first time around."
5,Your chord book search is over,"I purchased this book because i read some of the reviews on this book and decided to take a chance on it. I am jumping for joy, this book IS truly the best darn chord book on the market and I've seen many. I cant believe the way this book is laid out and I expected a skinny all purpose book, but I got a fairly thick book full of magnificent chord forms in an amazing array of fingerings. The guitarist who purchase this book will be so far ahead of most other guitarists who just cant seem to find the right book to work from, this book is great for pros and soon to be pros because what is in this book will create pros."
5,the guitar chord book with over 2000 chords,this book is great it is a life saver for people that have short fingerswho want to learn chords to play guitar it is the only guitar chord book you will ever need. i give is book a five star rateing. dorothy from arkansas. thanks
3,Guitar chord wheel book,"I am not very pleased with this book. Mainly because it was not what I wanted. As far as the contents, it was very well arganized and informative."
1,Self-loathing intellectual,"Every page of her account of her trip, undertaken a few months after the North Vietnamese massacres in Hue, gives voice to her self-flagellating sense of guilt for being a wealthy citizen of USA. She loathes herself for being poisoned by capitalist society and its pleasures. A schizophrenic outlook emerges, because Sontag believes that she has found paradise in Hanoi. She forgives herself for the grievous sin of reaping benefits of her own society, which she hates. She is just a radical leftist weirdo, who would not survive 48 hours in the society which she idolizes."
3,Really Good for what it was,"This movie actually surprised me. I have a great love of B-movies and I assume that is why Amazon recommended it to me, but I had never heard of it. I decided to take a chance and picked it up.The storyline is cohesive. The acting is somewhat better than the acting in similar films (especially on the parts of Lisa Boyle and Colleen McDermott).Though there is of course ample sex, it doesn't seem overly awkward or contrived. It works in the context of the picture. (With the possible exception of a single scene involving Kira Reed, whom I normally love in these movies).In general I respect the niche for low-budget erotica, but its always a pleasant surprise when one comes along that makes a decent movie on its own merits even without being judged as a soft-core flick."
2,Not Intact,"I liked the movie since watching it on cable, This version had some very hot scenes removed from it for VHS, dont buy it if you have seen the unedited version on cable."
3,Okay DVD,"The plot and acting is just like one of those midnight movies-actually it is. ANyways, the dissapointment was that the front cover shows Nikki nova who goes by her real name Nicole Italiano-zaza and yet she is only in the beginning. I only found Nicole and lisa Boyle worth watching. The other scenes were just okay or duds. By the way, if you are looking for special features on this dvd, don't bother."
3,Lisa Boyle is supperb,"The movie made my plesently supprised. The acting was good, and the plot was easy to follow. Just watch it and see."
2,This Stinks! I loved Lisa Boyle in other movie- BUT ...,"Come on people! I loved I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES, but I lost most of my fascination with Lisa Boyle after sitting through this dismal movie. I know the plot is not supposed to be important when watching ""these"" movies, but I expect a little better, sometimes: THIS STINKS! If you want to watch something ""Hot"" with at least a little plot thrown in, see I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES (NOT the sequel which was pretty bad and desperatley needed Lisa Boyle)"
5,Carbine Information,"I received this book an began inmmediatly to read the information. I consider historical information and back up data for my firearms collection and this book gave me as much information as I would expect for a book that deals with a number of firearms. I can highly recommend this book for the the beginner especially, but there is good information for the trained collector."
2,Missing a part,My fryer was bought as a Christmas gift for a friend. When he opened it there was no cord for the fryer. It has been two weeks and he still has not been able to use it. Amazon was out of these particular fryers so I could not exchange it. I contacted T-Fal and they were to send a replacement cord. It has been a week and we have not received it yet. My freind loves the look of it and can't wait to use it. We found the best price on Amazon but unfortunately didn't get all of the parts.
3,Fryer,"Not really worth the extra money....just use a cheap Fry Daddy or the a skillet on the stove. It's difficult to keep clean, gets a little smoky and takes more grease, but it can be stored in the fryer."
1,FALSE METAL,"This band is the worst band I have ever heard. You call this METAL?? Most metal bands I have heard have made actual musical stuff. This CD is loud and boring. Does this band have any concept of melody?? I guess not. And to top it off, they aren't even heavy, just loud. Heavy is something that comes from composition, something these guys know nothing about."
4,Korn is one of the best almums out!,"Korn is definetly a great album for any teenage kid. While the lyrics might be unclear or hard to listen to, the band's creativity makes this CD fantastic! I think if you only get one Korn CD, go with this self-titled album!"
1,This album stinks,The lead singer screams to much in this album. The band has no real talent in my opinion.
1,This album stinks,"It would be good if they could actually play good music. There music is not that good in my opinion what do you expect? they did teach themselves how to play the guitar. There music would be good if it was not just complete noise, not having any melody. Rage Against The Machine is one hundred times better."
1,As interesting as a steaming pile of dog crap,"First off, I am ashamed to say this album was bought because of a lost bet. Now I understand how this became the center of the bet. It is unsuitable to be used as a coster. Talent, incredible if you have it, nu-metal if you don't. Being forced to listen to this miserable waste of money and effort was just about intolerable. Advice: 1)Don't buy it. 2) Go get some Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Iced Earth, Judas Priest, Metallica (the early years), or anything that isn't Korn. If I could rate this any lower I would. Of all the heros of music that have dies and we are stuck with this. Wish they were Kurt Cobain so he could have gotten them in front of the gun too."
1,I Would Give It 0 Stars If I Could,"This album is so terrible it makes me feel sick. How can anyone in the world call this a masterpiece, its an embarassment to music. This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Blind, clown and daddy are complete rubbish nothing stands out at all. Ball tongue is the biggest joke in history he shouts BALL TONGUE BALL TONGUE what a queer jonothan davis is on this album.Dont buy it it is complete trash and you will only sell it like I haveDONT BUY THIS ALBUM"
1,"Repetitive junk. If you like wrenches, you'll like this!","This cd is korns worst album. It has a few creative songs such as shoots and latters, but other than that, it contains mostly wrench songs. Dont get this album. Get FTL (Follow the leader) instead. At least it contains less wrenches..."
3,KORN'S DEBUT IS GOOD!!!!,"I'm not a big fan of new metal, but this debut from KORN is one album apart from the rest!!! I remenber when this come out... Somebody told me that Korn was like Rage Against the Machine, but when i listen to BLIND, BALL TONGUE, DIVINE.....First of all, i didn't understand most anything the singer was saying...But this KORN 1 is really really brutal and raw... Besides 1 or 2 songs, i think this debut from KORN is kind of a HEAVY METAL HISTORICAL ALBUM!!! After this, most of ALL the heavy bands started to sound like Korn...Ah! And the many many many many bands that comes sounding like Korn clones!!!"
3,Definitely Korn's best,"This was obviously Korn's first, but definitely the best one, don't even bother getting the others if you don't have a Korn cd...I won't even bother getting the new one, just from what I've heard, & how the last album sounded. As an album, this has it's moments, although I have to be in the mood for it, & showed Korn had potential...at some point...then they just lost it cuz of fame...probably from ""selling out"", & then being apart of that rap-rock thing, which they DID NOT START (I agree with the previous review, Rage started that in this decade). So, get this if you just have to get 1 Korn cd."
5,It just doesn't get any better,"Definitely one of the best CDs that I own, if not THE best. Every song on here is great. But it isn't for the faint-at-heart. This is a heavy album; one that you just have to play really loud. If you're pissed off about anything, you'll feel alot better after listening to this."
5,R U READY?,R U READY? The words that started out the Korn legacy of being the Heavy Metal Band Of the Decade. Songs like blind and shoots and latters crazed every teenagers minds with loud screaming and heavy sounds. The combonation of new sounds and The Amazing Sounds of Jon Davis make this CD the pioneer of all hard rock... If you have any sense at all you will buy this CD...
4,Wow!!!,"This is the most impressive recording of rapcore music I have ever heard. The quality of the recording is amazing! I feel as though Jonathan is singing right there in the same room. The intensity of this album and the raw energy behind it is something to be experienced. You can just hear the intensity and passion behind Jonathan's vocals as he takes you through an amazing roller coaster of emotions. Quite an amazing record indeed. I can't recommend it enough. I just wish the lyrics were a bit more on the positive tip, but all in all, a very good recording! --Kelly Magovern"
5,Evil thoughts just creepin through my mind,"KoRn and their music saved my life. They saved me from myself. There is no one out there that can even touch their power and sound. KoRn-Flakes are everywhere now-a-days, but you just can't beat the real thing. If you've never heard KoRn, you should... it just might change your life."
3,I'm not getting something . . .,"I've often heard KoRn being praised as the kings of new metal and/or rap metal. They are seriously popular, which makes it seem like they would be very good. I'm afraid i just don't see it in them. Their music is extremely sloppy, and the songwriting leaves much to be desired. The lyrics, despite their fame for being political, are nonsensical. And the vocals and detuned guitars are painful to hear. Don't get me wrong: there are some interesting songs, and despite the poor quality, most of the songs are at least listenable. My advice is: listen before you buy. Better yet: don't buy--burn."
5,This is the best Cd,Korn is the best band out there and this cd kicks a**. If youlike this cd check ou the other two. Follow The Leader is a good cdbut it isn't as hard as the first two. If you already have this cd rock on. If not go out and buy it. Peace
5,EXCELLENT,"This record is definately one of the best by KoRn, before they became more rap and grunge orienated. It's got their original heavy screaming rock flavor and it's definately their best album!"
5,I think Korn is awsome,"I'M a korn freak i have posters and cloths galore i think the lead singer and base are so hot. And of course i love ""Freak on a leash"""
3,So-So,The guitarism is OK in some songs but............ THE VOCALS SUCK SUCK SUCK! JOHN NEEDS TO GET SOME MIC SKILLS! He's even worse in Follow the Leader!
5,korn,"Their best CD out there. The others don't come close to matching this raw, electric, and unique CD."
1,True inspiration? No.,"You have to wonder at a band like this. I figure it just has to be all an act. A misguided act. Get some guys together; think up an alterno-sounding name; write a bunch of agressive, hate-filled songs; and oh yeah, make sure we get that ""explicit lyrics"" label on the cover. Can't be without that.What does the band stand for? Who knows. It's all ""attitude"" and no real substance. What exactly is it contributing to the world? No idea. Can't call it entertainment. And it is too calculated and mock-anger-filled to call it artistry.Of course, the kids think it ""kicks a$$!"". We no longer have good bands anymore that make good music. Instead we have bands that either ""suck"" or ""kick a$$!"". Too sad."
1,terrible,"Yeh, I admit Korn is an awesome group, but look at what they sing about. The cover of one of their CDs has a little girl on a swing and a man is watching her like he wants to mollest her. I think it is all sick and wrong. They are a negitive influence on anybody. If you want a band that is a positive influence on you, go to a local christian bookstore and buy a CD called blindside. Or vistit toothandnail.com to find out more about them. God rocks, not Korn."
1,4 1/2 star rating?? Are you people insane?,"Horrible vocals, weak-sauce riffs, inaudible bass, simple drumming, NO SOLOS MELODIES or ANYTHING that classifies this as good music. Jon Davis is the biggest poser ever. Whats wrong with the music industry, is this a joke or something? Korn SUCKSWant to listen to real metal?Immortal, In Flames, Old Metallica, Anthrax, Pantera, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath or anything in between. No need for this whiny crap"
5,by far their best CD,"This is a tremendous CD. Korn rips and tears at anger with honesty; there is no pretense here. I have a couple of their other releases, and this rivals them all.The sound is refreshing. Korn avoids the problem of every song sounding the same. This CD is enthralling and deserves recognition as a great piece of work.I am intrigued with the song, ""Daddy."" Incest, I believe, has never been so well emoted. It is extremely emotional and haunts the listener long after the CD has been ejected from the player.Without question, this CD is full of similar, raw experiences.The inclusion of bagbipes, in some of the songs, is fascinating.I strongly recommend this CD to those people who enjoy rage and anger in their music."
5,One of my favorite albums of all time,"This is one of my favorite albums, it is up there with more of my favorites like Brotha lynch Hung's season of da siccness, Deftones' adrenaline, snoop dogg's doggystyle and biohazard's state of the world address. Korn are my easily my favorite rock group. My favorite songs on this album would have to be predictable, blind, clown, and divine. Pick this up if you have not already. Peace Out"
3,decent effort,"I got this album back in 95 when i heard blind. Blind is a really song and I was expecting the rest of the album to be like it, but korn's songs don't flow well. Shoots and Ladders and Daddy are more moaning then actual music. Good heavy metal would be like judeas priest, motorhead, soundgarden and alice in chains. Korn falls short of this standard."
5,cool,korn is one of my favorite bands of all time. this cd has great sounds and through jons voice you can hear what he is feeling. i have listen to this cd almost every day for a long time now and i can't get sick of it. usualy you buy a great cd you listen to it over and over and pretty soon it gets old. but when you listen to this cd that doesn't happen. i really like the hard core stuff. but i don't really get all the rap they put in there last cd follow the leader. but hey it was still great. i am very excited about there new cd they are working on and i heard it is very hard core. so if you don't have this cd go get it!!!!
5,Korn is the best...no arguments about it.,"This cd is so awnsome. A dream come true. It's the greatest sound that you'll ever here. If you don't like metal you won't enjoy this cd, but, if you do you'll never be able to stop playin' it. I hope that by 2000 more people like them then now. They deserve it :D"
5,good stuff,"In a very basic sense, this album is like Follow the Leader, but there are quite a few differences. For one thing, the drum sound is different, a lot less electronic, and the guitar pedals used on FTL are not here either. Also, frontman Davis does a lot more straight yelling and rasta raps than he does on FTL. Personally, I think this first album is every bit as good as FTL, the sound is just harder. Blind for instance, is a classic, I think it and BBK from FTL are the two best songs Korn has done. Lyrically and musically. Clown, Fake, and Shoots and Ladders stand out as well on this album. I'd say this is a tribute to their greatness that they can sound this good and be so simple. The fact that they've expanded their horizens with FTL shouldn't be held against them. Truly good bands don't play the same old thing until everyone's tired of them. Basically, to all you people who bought FTL first, get this one too, even if you don't buy Life is Peachy--I still feel they phoned that one in."
4,"Solid, but not their best","koRn is an awesome band, but the better album is by far Follow the LeadeR. FAGET is the best in the album, and also solid songs include SHOOTS AND LADDERS, HELMET IN A BUSH, BALL TOUNGUE, and CLOWN. Don't get this unless you have Follow the LeadeR, though."
3,"What the hell kind of name is ""KORN"" anyway?","Korn basically took almost everything out of metal (and rock in general) that makes it good- melody, harmony, guitar solos- and replaced it with trendy rap beats and angsty, ""dark"" lyrics. It was still loud, and therefore labeled ""metal"" by MTV and the music industry, who were eager to sell a new image. This is the album that spawned numerous trendy nu-metal groups that kept metal pretty much dead throughout the nineties.It's not a complete loss- when this came out there was really nothing else that sounded like it, the bagpipes are cool and some of the choruses are catchy. There are a few good songs on here and the Life is Peachy album, but for the most part this band is overrated and there is better stuff out there to listen to (unless you just HAVE to have to hear songs about some guy being raped by his daddy- or songs about being a ""faget""). If you want to hear good metal, go pick up Black Sabbath's Greatest Hits, or Rust in Peace by Megadeth."
5,GREAT MUSIC & MASTERPIECE.,"I MUST ADMIT THAT I WASN'T INTO THIS TYPE OF MUSIC BUT UNTIL I LISTENED TO IT FROM A FRIEND OF MINES & BOY WAS I HOOKED INTO THIS. THEN I STARTED TO GET A COPY OF MY OWN & THIS IS GREAT HEAVINESS HERE.I NEVER THOUGHT THAT MUSIC LIKE THIS DESERVES A NOMINEE, GREAT OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE BY THESE GUYS, GREAT!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREATEST BAND EVER!!!,"KORN IS THE GREATEST BAND EVER. THEIR SOUND IS TOTALLY ORIGINAL. IT'S LOUD IN-YOUR-FACE SOUND KEEPS YOU LISTENING. THE 1ST ALBUM IS BETTER THAN THE 2ND IN MY OPINION CAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH HIP-HOP IN IT, BUT MORE HARDCORE ROCK SOUND. JON IS AN AWESOME SINGER WHO PUTS EVERYTHING INTO HIS SONGS. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY."
4,"If you like Ministry or Slayer, read this summary.","I am a 25 year old clean cut Wisconsin Jock who was into Slayer and Ministry to name my favorites. I still listen to a very limited amount of bands. The first time I listened to Korn I was blown away. They have a very original sound that incorporates metal, jazz, rap rhythms, and nursery rhymes. A must have, I can't stop listening to it over, & over. I am driving my wife nutty. She's even singing the words now."
5,Korn rules,"i hope all u anti-koRn losers choke on a bottle cap.Truly they can play music and to think of they came from the gutter and are still here!they are the most phonomonol band i have ever listened to ,they rox."
4,bagpipes are deadly.,"considering that bakersfield is a filthy pile of trash in the midst of the semi-desert california wasteland and considering that the hellhole harbors vacant rejects from L.A., i was pretty impressed when i heard this album. the only korn recording worth spending money on. tracks like blind and clown were staggering in their emotional brutality and shoots and ladders was especially twisted in that (played out) kinderwhore sort of way."
2,Below average,"I gave it another listen and decided it was just below average. Only good song is ""Blind."" ""Shoots and Ladders"" has a great intro with the bagpipes and guitars, but the rest is crap, at about the time of 1:55 I switch to another song. Get ""Follow the Leader"" over this.2/5"
3,My First Metal CD,"I will openly admit that Korn are sellouts, and bands like Neurosis, Dying Fetus, and Fear Factory are a million times better. However, this is the CD that got me started on the whole ""metal"" thing, and I therefore must show at least some respect. So what if Fieldy's the only good musician in the band, and the double guitar technique isn't anywhere near where it could be? The songs still have the ability to rock, and unlike future Korn albums, they don't all sound the same. If you're new to Korn, only buy this CD and stay far, far away from all the others. If you only have their latest stuff, you'll be blown away by this.Oh yeah, and the lyrics are actually REAL angst, not some sellout B.S. like on Issues."
1,"Please shut it off, it's giving me a headache","I'm willing to try new things, but this is a very weak album to listen to. I've listened to it the whole way through and thrown it away. The worst CD I've ever bought. Don't make my mistake and buy this too."
1,actually its not worth 1 star,How did this crappy band get so popular. There is absolutly zero talent. The guitars are laughable. And the repetitive whining lyrics. Give me a break. This was the album that spawned the worst genre of music since country! If you think this is good music than I feel sorry for you. Who wants to listen to jon davis cry about his daddy molesting him? The real tragedy is that his dad didnt kill him while he was at it.
5,One for the music hall of fame,"This is one album that is sure to enter the hall of fame of rock, this hard rock jewel is one of the best C.D,s i've ever listened to. Powerful songs like Blind or Ball tongue make this C.D outstanding, this is by far KoRn'S best album and that is much to say 'cause Life is peachy and Follow the leader are great albums, Fieldy's bass is great, Munky and Head's gutars will make your spine tingle and the lyrics by Davis are moving and powerful, tracks like daddy or faget will either make you cry or rejoice by their quality."
5,The definition of modern hard rock,"At this point, there is no one that hasn't heard of KoRn. There are people, however, that have never heard their early music. With the current deluge of new hard rock bands, there is no doubt that KoRn is the best, and this album proves it beyond the shadow of a doubt. There are very few albums that I can honestly say all the songs on are great, but there is no doubt that this is one of them. From ""Blind"" all the way to ""Daddy"", every last second of this CD is great. Jon Davis's passionate, emotional vocals provide the uniqueness that makes KoRn KoRn, and backed by the instrumentaion from Head and Munky (guitars), Fieldy (bass), and Dave (drums), it all comes together to make possibly the best CD to come out of the 90s."
5,a fabulous cd,"I'm going to have to say, right here and now, this is one of the best CD's I own. I bought it in 1995, and the thing is still spinning around my player today.This is the best Korn CD there is. I suggest this CD above all others, no matter if you like the singles on MTV better. This CD is real. Jonathan Davis' lyrics are intense, disturbing, and gut-renching. The music is loud, powerful, and almost artfully, unpolished. The bass is possibly the best part of korn, musically, and adds a very interesting rythum to the tracks.My favorite tracks are probably ""Faget,"" and ""Daddy."" I like how relatable this CD is. I bought it at thirteen, and today, at almost twenty, I can still relate to it. If you've never heard this CD before, get ready, it'll blow you away."
3,The worst of KoRn,"Now most of you are thinking just the oppisite of what I titled this, but in my little mind, that's true. This is definetly the worst of KoRn, but it's not bad to the point you want to throw it away. I only like 3 songs so far, and they're not really even that good. They are ""Ball Tongue"", ""Need To"", and ""Divine"". I'd rate ""Ball Tongue"" 6/10. The intro's really good but the verses and the chorus [stink]. The B-section's OK but kind of boring because they repeat the same thing over and over. ""Need To"" gets 7/10. The intro's not really that good. Everything else is OK. ""Divine"" gets 10/10 for the fact that it's my favorite. The whole song's good with catchy lyrics, growling vocals, and overall good guitars.If you like old Limp Bizkit, Staind, Linkin Park, or Cold you'll like this.(0Y0)"
5,ARE YOU F*CKING READY?!,I love KoRn and Marilyn Manson if it makes sense. My favorite track is Clown because its the hardest and its actually hella funny too. KoRn fans u know what i mean. Buy it as a nice donation to the KoRn. Dont tell me youre not ready.
1,This a sorry CD.,This is a sorry CD. All i hear is this weak voice and guitars making this nasty grunt sound all the time. These guys have to learn how to play their guitars.
1,yuck,"korn has the same view of music that kiss and guns n' roses had. it is sad that people will even mention nirvana in the same sentence as them. this is not hardcore. real hardcore is black flag, minor threat, snapcase and necros."
1,KORN IS A DISGRACE TO METAL!,KORN IS THE BIGGEST DISGRACE TO METAL THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD. I MEAN COME ON EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME AND THEY ONLY KNOW LIKE TWO CHORDS! IF YOU WANT A GOOD BAND TRY TOOL OR DEFTONES OR MAYBE EVEN REAL BANDS LIKE BLACK SABBATH OR PINK FLOYD....
4,Rules,"Ok, the birth of nu-metal began with this cd. And it was off to a great start. Clown, Blind, Shoots and Ladders, Divine, Ball Tongue are my favorite tracks on this cd. ""ARE YOU READY?!?!"" the first three words heard on this cd were certainly fitting words. KoRn RULES!!!"
5,This is the Real KoRn,"For all you pathetic KoRn fans who like KoRn cause ""got the life is the best video"" or ""head is so hot"" or cause ""freak on a leash is the best song"" i spit on u. KoRn at this point are nothing but mainstream sellout pop stars. I lost so much respect for them after the release of ""Follow the Leader"". KoRn is the best cd ever made and KoRn can never gain there respect back in my eyes..."
2,can't anyone white just be white???????,"yea a couple of tunes rock, however haven't we reached the saturation point with white men acting like they are black????? braids in a guys hair, nothing a good smack couldn't cure, you don't see blacks acting white???? Hmmmm maybe they are on to something ????????"
1,blech,I really hate this band. They are so LIMITED in musical ability and Davis's voice is HORRIBLY weak.
1,Excruciatingly Awful,"This is KoRn's very best CD, which means that it is one of the worst CDs ever made. Don't waste your time or money on this mind-numbing junk."
1,The most overrated band I've heard,"""Korn"" merely proves a theory I've had for a few years now: Nothing good has ever come out of Bakersfield, CA. Korn is what I would define as ""Garbage"" metal. That being obnoxious lyrics combined with loud instruments played very poorly. They are loud and aggressive like older metal bands, but they have absolutley no sense of melody or harmony. That's what will forever seperate them from the true great bands like Black Sabbath and 1980s Metallica. Even Slayer has more melody than these guys! I guess they are just one of those fad bands that all the teenagers get into that will eventually fade away in a couple of years once the next ""in"" band comes along."
5,GREAT!,"Korn's self-titled debut is by far their best CD! . Songs like Blind, Faget and Clown make it worth the money! . I really hope that Korn returns to it's roots and stop being so MTV so they can sell more records!. Don't get me wrong...""Issues"" was a great CD...but I think they should reunite with Ross Robinson. Here David's drums are fast and aggressive, unlike ""Issues"". If you call yourself a Korn fan then you must already own this CD, but if you're just getting to know them, then know that ""issues"" is NOTHING compared to this! . WARNING! This Cd is not for everyone as it features Jonathan's most disturbed and dark lyrics to date specially on the last song ""Daddy"" wich concludes with Jon crying and screaming in a really emotional way...a song he refuses to sing ever again to this very date. If you want the real Korn buy this CD...then you will know why they reinvented Heavy music as we knew it."
5,"Korn's first and best, not for those who like issues","i can't say enough about this cd. this is one of those rarities where you can listen to every single song on the album. it is the only korn album i can say it for. i wouldn't suggest this cd to the people that liked them after they heard follow the leader or issues, you are not gonna like. this is by no means pop sounding like issues, i cannot stand issues, issues is a cd korn made for money. so this cd is for hardcore metal fans only. those who like this amazing cd should check out the deftones, coal chamber, skinlab, and slipknot."
5,probably their best effort,"i was rough on korn when i reviewed life is peachy... but then i think a lot of people would agree with the fact that that album was overrated. the fact is, a lot of bands use downtuning and heavy usage of guitar effects to hide their lack of talent.. but korn is an original band, who are skilled where most other bands that are similar, are not. they can make songs that are effective and powerful.. this album, is likely their best, with their best lyrics, and best tunes... clown, blind, need to, shoots and ladders, faget, predictable are some of the great songs.. near the end of the album, things get a tad weaker, but not very much. each song has good variation and interesting progressions, as opposed to life is peachy where many of the songs sound too much the same. korn does a great job of making some weird sounding guitar sounds and resolving them with a furious fit of crunching noise. excellent album, much better than life is peachy.."
3,Its ok,"I think this album is the worst of all the Korn cds. I do like the songs Faget, Daddy, Blind and clown. But the rest is 2nd rate. I love the ending monologue of daddy were the 2 parents were fighting over the car or something. It was *** cool dude!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Great! An angry, hate-filled, heavy metal masterpeice!","I love this c.d.! The only reason I gave it four stars is because I don't like the song ""Predictable"", so I couldn't give it five stars. Anyway, this c.d. is great. I love it how Jonathan Davis gets right to the point with his lyrics. He expesses just how he feels. He doesn't beat around the bush or use a bunch of that metaphoric stuff that the so-called ""great lyricists"" use. If he wants to say ""f**k you"", he'll say ""f**k you"". And to all of you people who think that Jonathan Davis is just acting on here, he is not. All the stuff he sings and screams about on here actually happened. Such as the last song ""Daddy"". It's about him being abused as a child. It is also a very sad and emotional song. The music on here is also great! Very heavy, very cool. I highly recommend this c.d. to anyone who likes heavy metal or even alternative music! I can't wait until their new c.d. comes out on Novemeber 16!!"
2,Understand other reviews are written by fanatic Korn fans.,"""Blind"" is perhaps one of the best metal songs of this decade. It's the only track on this album where you can actually appreciate Jonathon's rants among the rough riffs - it's got a good hook. The other tracks are only Okay. But even ""Blind"" is topped by Korn's current hits, ""Got the Life"" and ""Freak on A Leash."""
5,THIS CD RULZ!!!!!!!,"This is the worlds best cd...it rulz...every song rulz...even the cover rulz!!!Just four wordz: ""BUY IT, IT RULZ!!"""
1,You're kidding right?,"The greatest hard rock album of all time? Yeah, and wonder bread is the most nutritious thing you can feed your children. Why do you suppose half the reviews for this album are from kids? BECAUSE IT'S KID MUSIC. These guys are a much lamer version of Nine Inch Nails at best. You want real music? Listen to Psychopomps, Biopsy, Klute or Steril just to name a few. All those groups make Korn look like a backstreet boy singing a duet with Bette Midler."
1,"Whining, more whining...","I must say that when I first bought this album, I had very high hopes for it. I generally like Nirvana, Metallica, and other bands similar to those, but Korn was a bitter disappointment. Jonathan Davis's vocals are NOT good. He sings with a range that is average. The instrumentals, due to lack of a better word, [smell]. No guitar solos, no melody, just noise.As for the mood of this album, it is just depressing.... If you respect music, creative lyrics and melody, do not. In fact, I suggest that you do yourself a favor and go buy some MetallicA or Iron Maiden. ...A pure waste of money."
5,6 Star Album,Great Album period.This launched nu-metal. My favforite genre or metal. Ebverything here is so raw and original. Blind is just pure freaking amazing and daddy at the end really closes this one of with the most emotional ending of any album.Go out and buy this if you havent already.
5,Korn's Best Album,"This album is the best of the 4. It is so much more ""dark"" and exciting than their following 3 albums even though they are awesome. This is the only album that you can listen to all the way through without changing songs. I say this because on all of the other albums there are a few slow songs which are not Korn's strong points. I think Korn should stick with what they are good at HARDCORE music."
5,The Best KoRn CD Ever,"Jon's use of lyrical content plus the awesome sound of all the instruments in the band combined makes this cd the perfect debut cd. There are 12 good reasons to buy this cd: 1. Blind, 2. Ball Toungue, 3. Need To, 4. Clown, 5. Divine, 6. Faget, 7. Shoots and Ladders, 8. Predictable, 9. Fake, 10. Lies, 11. Helmet in the Bush, 12 Daddy. If you don't have this cd by now then you must not be true KoRn fans. So show your alleigence to KoRn and buy this cd if you don't already have it."
4,"Aw, shucks....","I can't stand Korn's music for the most part, but on the whole this is a pretty darned good album. Did I really just say that? Aw, GEEZ...."
3,dear mastershake,"mastershake: well i read some of the reviews you made, and you said that Jar of Flies, which came out in 1994, copied the sound of Godsmack, who came out in 1999. wow. are you sure you know how to count? you said the same thing that nirvana (who i strongly dislike) copied puddle of mudd, even though kurt cobain was dead before puddle of mudd was even a thought. and then you listen to hillary duff, a friggin gimmick. wow i can sure use your opinion on buying cds. you know exactly what you're talking about.as for the cd. defiantly not their best in my opinion. issues seems to be the only stand out of the bunch. follow the leader is alright also, but it's a little too crazy for me. i'd but korn third on the album list then untouchables then life is peachy then the new one which is a piece of crap. I like issues the most because it has the most rythm and best vocal work. on this album i enjoy blind, clown, and daddy."
5,"my best CD, and I have over 300","Every single song on this CD is great. I have over 300 CDs, and this one (along with Rage Against the Machine's debut) is by far the best. Shoots and Ladders could possibly be the best song ever made. I would also recommend Follow the Leader, but Life is Peachy and Issues aren't very good."
1,Blasphemy...,"People calling korn brutal? Thats a blasphemy... I quess that, they never heard of goregrind music? or deathmetal?Anyways, korn's ""korn"" is a weak release and even doe they were original with their sound? I give them that... It still sucks. lame!"
5,KORN IS THE BEST,"OK LISTEN UP! ALL OF KORN'S ALBUMS R THE BEST. THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS KORN, THE SECOND LIFE IS PEACHY, THE THIRD FOLLOW THE LEADER, AND ISSUES THEIR NEW ONE. DON'T LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE. IF U LIKE KORN GET ALL THEIR ALBUMS. I HAVE ALL OF THEM AND THEY R AWESOME. I LOVE THEM. IF U LIKE THEM GET THEM. I ALSO LIKE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, DMX, LIMP BIZKIT, ROB ZOMBIE, AND WHITE ZOMBIE. KORN RULES"
5,What A start for the greatest band!!!!!!!!!!,What a start. ARE YOU READY!!!... First lyrics Eva for the greatest band in the world. Let me sum it up...Blind-10/10Ball tounge-10/10Need to-10/10Clown-10/10Divine-10/10Faget-10/10Shoots and ladder-10/10Predictable-10/10Fake-10/10Lies-10/10Helmet in the Bush-10/10Daddy-10/10Need I say more. So get off your ass and buy this and the other 5 Albums. Korn 4 eva!!!...
5,Best Metal Album Ever Made,"I got this album the day it hit store shelves and I've had to replace it twice already just from wear and tear. That's how much playtime it still gets almost 15 years later. My favorite band, my favorite album. Don't hesitate to buy this one."
5,Awesome!,"Numetal kind of raped it's self and got old very quick, but it started out on a high note. Korns self titled first album is pure excellence! The bass guitar is amazing! The grooves are catchy and the riffs are heavy. The lyrics are insightful reality based poems about things we can all relate too such as getting made fun of, child abuse, anger, depression and other angsty topics. I highly recomend this. I feel as though this is their strongest work to date and their message that will stand the test of time. Enjoy! -Dre"
5,"The first KoRn, the best KoRn","Two words can only describe the first Korn CD: the best. Not even Untouchables topped this album. It starts with a dark sounding scream ""ARE YOU READY?"" That can only serve as a hint of what's ahead. This is a 56 minute journey through the mind of singer Jonathan Davis. WARNING: this record is not for the faint of heart. The album contains tales of anger, hate, abuse, paranoia, and pain. Another emaphasis is Davis' voice. It sounds completely different from the other 4 albums. It is a low, demonic, dark sounding voice. Still, eight years after its release, no other Korn CD even came close to beating this one. Go pick this up!!"
2,"well, they did try","i bough this cd after losing the letters to write home about cd(or whatever you call it) and it sucked. it was way to synthy for me and they butchered teh lyrics, but thats me!"
5,Great Study Tool,"This was a great study tool for my son, it helped him perpare for his Regents Exams."
4,great sound,"Musically and vocally this band truly does rock. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that though they - a Japanese band - make a great effort to write and thus perform in English, their work is just not 100% fluent English. I would like to sing along with them, but my mind is constantly arguing about the grammer. I do give them lots of respect for choosing to work in a foreign language, and pulling it off as well as they do. Honestly, this band is great and I do plan on getting more of their albums in the future."
4,Casting a new light,"The saw is powerful, and is just what I wanted. But, I am disappointed with the appearance. The casting at the end of the arm, just under the on/off switch is missing a chunk. This does not reflect good on Delta's inspection practice."
5,THREE SAW USER,"I found this saw to be exactly as described and after having two previous ten-inch Craftsman radial arm saws this appears like a tank next to them. There was only the slightest adjustment of the saw and it cuts true persistently with the accuracy I expected. The Old Saw Company makes another nice version but it will cost you a $1000 more and is larger. This saw was set on one side of a garage wall near the entrance and it abuts Formica cabinets that provide a large extension for ripping wood. It takes up far less room than a table saw and bolted to the floor along with its weight it is rock solid.They sent me a blade that was almost useless. It was an eighty-tooth carbide expensive blade with zero kerf. After almost a day of adjustment I realized that the blade was designed for laminates and I replaced it with a cheap, ten-inch carbide blade and everything came to life. I purchased the Forrest Woodworker One blade with a six inch stiffener and this baby performed just as I expected."
1,DELTA! Not what it used to be.,"Due to hurricane damage, I was forced to replace my 18 year old Delta radial arm saw with a new Delta 33-895X saw. The new saw came with a defective motor that had to be sent in for warranty replacement. I am now told that the new motor is back-ordered and I will not receive it for at least 4 to 6 weeks. We have been without it for three weeks so far. We are a manufacturer and need our tools to be reliable, plus quick and easy to repair.To add to this, the quality of the finished product is not good. I suspect that this tool is not American made anymore. I always try to buy the best I can afford. If I wanted cheap I could have saved more than a few hundred dollars by buying an import.So much for good old american made."
3,Jazz book ~ amateur,The book discusses jazz at a level deeper than this poor amateur's knowledge. An ability to sight read music would seem required for comprehension. Damn cos i sense much there to be enjoyed!
5,TWINS,"After reading a lot about the children't book, TWINS, I searched for in book stores (where it cannot be obtained). I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com and even happier to get it in ample time for it to be a baby shower gift. It's a great find. Thank you."
4,My daughter's favorite book!,My twins are nearly 3 and this is one of their favorite books (my daughter especially). I agree that the story doesn't make much sense but there is a natural progression from play to bath to bedtime that makes this book a bedtime story favorite. The pages are very sturdy and easy for the kids to turn themselves. I like the look of the illustrations too. A big hit in my house!
4,Great gift for twins!,I really like this book! It is so cute and would make a great gift. The only thing I didn't like is that it is so short.
2,Not as good as what Vitamin C has to offer....,"I was actually exposed to Vitamin C [Colleen Fitzpatrick, Eve's Plum's lead vocalist] before Eve's Plum. In fact, I only listened to this because I heard she was part of this band before she started her solo career. And quite frankly, I was disappointed. Her solo stuff is so much better. This is annoying, repetitive, blaring garage rock, not nearly as catchy as Vitamin C's stuff. Yeah, she may have succumbed to generic but addictive radio pop, but I think that's a good thing. This stuff is just crap. Go check out Colleen's solo albums instead."
4,The Rhinehart Reader,"I was very ecstatic with the condition of the book, it was more than what I expected. I told my teacher that I was able to get the book at such a great price and in such great condition, he said, ""That's the way to do it""."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"Noticed a few errors on dates and some misidentification of people. Much like the book ""Thrilling Adventures of Daniel Ellis"" by Daniel Ellis, which was one of the sources of this book, it was somewhat biased against the Confederacy. Worth using as a reference as long as it is cross referenced with other material available on the subject."
2,"Very weak, many omisions...","Sure, this book covers the Fenders and Gibsons adequately, but its coverage of some lesser know brands like Godin and Ibanez is a joke. For instance: Godin, who has manufactured at least 15-20 models since 1987, gets exactly one entry. Pathetic. Don't waste your money on this one. Hopefully they'll wake up and put out a much more comprehensive guide in the future. Until then just go to ebay and click on Search then Completed Items to find out how much a guitar is worth."
4,Maiden of Inverness,"This book is close to being her BEST. Revas Macduff is a special kind of hero, the kind that is equally virile as loveable, and the relationship between he and Gibby brings tears to the eyes. While The Maiden herself gets somewhat trying, Revas and the entire cast of supporting characters more than make up for the heroine's somewhat less than sterling performance. There were times I laughed out loud, with tears in my eyes. If you get the chance, GET THE SERIES! Border Lord, Chieftain, and The Maiden. You may even break down and get the rest of the Scottish Fold, Border Bride and a short story inside A Holiday of Love. Hurrah for a man like Revas!"
2,limited new insights,"Based on some of the other reviews, I was looking for a bit more insight on the concept of storytelling. Much of what is covered in this book is information covered in other books on Storytelling. Nevertheless, if you want an introduction to the storytelling as a better way to communicated this book is fine as a first read."
3,Anecdotes on the Future...,"I must admit that I am slightly surprised by the glowing reviews on this site. The Dream Society is a quick, easy, and somewhat enjoyable read which presents a good hypothesis and provides interesting examples. It is not however, the be-all and end-all book on the future, nor will it tell you exactly ""How the Coming Shift from Information to Imagination Will Transform Your Business"". On the positive side, it will certainly give you much fodder for interesting cocktail party conversation and is filled with anecdotes on how companies will have to sell their stories as much as their products. Mr. Jensen is clearly well travelled, multi-talented, and a capable director of the Copenhagen Institute of Future Studies. Read his book if you have the time, but don't count on running your business differently as a result."
4,Insightful!,"Rolf Jensen has written a thoroughly absorbing book about the nature of change. Although it attempts to predict the future, it is not a trend book. Rather, it is an attempt to figure out how society will be organized. Jensen analyzes trends only in the context of determining whether they have a place in the new global business model called the dream society. Anyone with an interest in understanding the personal and business paths that will exist in the future will find this book valuable. Anyone actively engaged in a global business will find this book invaluable in charting 21st century inflection points. We [...] recommend this book to all executives and managers doing business in the global economy."
4,A nice vision on a future that might already be here today.,"This is a good, visionary book on what could lie just around the corner of the information age. One should remember that future visions are no magic bullits, future visions are broad avenues rather that narrow paths, meant to make one think in different and new ways. People like Rolf Jensen have the ability to build a future vision without getting squishy or vague. This book is not about vague ideas but centers on the notion that we are more and more buying the 'story' behind products or services rather than the product or service itself. On the basis of this notion, implications for businesses, markets and people are laid down in an easy-going style.I have had the honour and opportunity to spend several hours with Rolf Jensen in June, 1999, we had plenty of time to talk undisturbed on a large variety of issues. Thanks, Rolf, for indulging me. He's a smart, witty and driven individual."
4,The Past does not Equal The Future. Know Why!,"Definitely coming from the New Sciences breakthrough achievements this book pleasantly takes us to our present 'inner world' and our future world in which this inner world will be expressed. This book builds a strong case for looking at ourselves, our 'now' and our future with the full spectrum of human components in view. And it provides us with interesting views on the translation of 'total human perspective' into society. Yes, this book may stimulate your ability to even capitalize on the 'Dream Society' in business terms. Jensen invites you to jump into his helicopter and take a ride with him to past, present and some possible futures. Join him, and broaden your view of, and your choice in, different 'parallel universes'."
3,Is the conclusion of the book right?,"This is an interesting and thought provoking book but I am afraid that I do not agree with the conclusion. Jensen argues that the next age after the information age will be the dream society. He ignores the facts. Economics is all about the allocation of scarce resources. We can not have a 'dream society' until the worlds resource problems have been addressed. As a result, the next age after the information age will have to be the quantum age, a period during which the world learns to change the vary structure of molecules themselves.Despite my reservations, I hope you enjoy the book anyway."
3,Decent but didn't last long,"I live in IA and we got a ton of snow last year. I bought this shovel and used it regularly throughout the year to shovel my small to moderate sized concrete driveway. Probably 15 - 20 uses. While it was functional it was a great shovel and scraped ice very well. However, by the end of the winter season the galvanized steel wear strip had worn completely through and wouldn't lay flat on the driveway anymore, making it very hard to shovel normally. I wouldn't buy another."
1,Do not order this shovel,I have used this shovel for only two N.Y. snow storms and it is already wearing through. The wear strip is mounted on the inside of the shovel. Thus the bottom of the shovel beneath the metal wear strip is wearing out. This shovel will not last one season. I have other suncast shovels which have the wear strip on both sides of the shovel. These products last longer. The shovel that I recommend is Suncast SC2700 20-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher Combo with Wear Strip And D-Grip Handle.
4,"For sure, this book was great! No doubt!","I decided to read a book for the fun of it, picked this one out and got a burst of excitement. I mainly like it for its originality and unexpected surprise characters! Good book Mikey. Whoever says different I got two words for you......SUCK IT!"
2,"Fairly bland, superficial killer virus/vampire combination.","I found this book to be pretty ho-hum. To his credit, the author does keep to a fairly straight storyline, not drifting so much that the reader can't keep up. However, the characters lacked individual depth, the character relationships were even less developed, and the science appeared to have no preparatory research. Most bothersome were the elements similar to another notable vampire-genre author (who was slightly denigrated by context, by the way). I found The Vampire Virus to be a very flat, dull ride. The amusing parts were in more of an ""Oh come on!"" sort of way, amused at the writing instead of by the writing."
4,romkey's usual,"no doubt, this was an excellent book, but I was lead to believe that it was going to be different than the others he's written in the ""series"" but it wasn't. Instead of Mozart he had Beethoven (seems to be preoccupied with the composers of the past). It was still the vampiri Illuminati. I thought this was going to be different. Once I realized it wasn't I found the book to be excellent (though I did miss David and Mozart)."
2,Boring..........,"Take way too many characters, make them extremely one-dimensional, give the reader an uninspired climax and there is the formula for THE VAMPIRE VIRUS. Throw in some plot holes and one of the most ridiculous charters every in a vampire story for added humility."
3,Interesting idea...,"It was an intriguing plot for a book, but it takes a totally different look on vampires than I have ever seen before (and I read a lot on vampires). It's an interesting read, but lacks true substance and credibility."
2,Too Abstract And Not backed by AOP implementation!,"The new ideas (use case slices and use case modules) that the authors try to get across is not backed by a practical (implementable) project that show how one can model, analyze, design, implement, deploy and test. Considering Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) implementation is real and easy using AspectJ, this book just songs and dances and repeats use case modeling concepts over and over again without actually showing a concrete AOP based software development. It would have been nice if the authors provided the complete model from start to finish for the Hotel Management backed up by AOP code. But the book doesn't deliver. It's just too theoretical."
5,why the chimes rang,"lovely pictures and great storynice to find a childrens christmas book that isnt a popular character of the monthadults will enjoy also, so makes reading together the experience it should be"
2,Fascinating Subject - Impossible Book,"This book was assigned as the text for an Environmental Archaeology class. Most of the class, undergraduate and graduate students, found the book exceptionally hard to comprehend. Sentences more appropriate to philosophical treatises or congressional documents written in ""govermentese"" made the sections difficult to follow. Chapter titling and section headings were very useful for tracking the thread of the author's argument but the clarity and concise wording expected in a scientific textbook was totally missing from the body of the text. The author was undoubtedly very intelligent and knowledgeable but was unable to convey her information in an interesting or succinct manner."
5,Better than War of Words,"Halford shows he's still the best and the guitar work just creates a rhythmic pounding pulse that keeps your head bobbing up and down. ""Small Deadly Space"" ""I Am Alive"" and ""Legacy of Hate"" are my favorites.Keep rocking Rob!!"
1,Don't waste your money on this c....p,"I'm a Halford fan,but I couldn't even listen to this album in it's entirety.I ended up flicking through the remaining tracks hoping to find at least one half decent track,but it was not to be.Halford's first Fight album[War of Words]which I recommend highly, was great,maybe because it was all composed by him.All the tracks on this one sound the same.If you don't want to waste your hard earned cash,go for his Resurrection or perhaps,Crucible.Steer clear of this one.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
2,Very boring...stick with the first Fight release,"This was very boring, none of the songs you can even get into except maybe the ""hidden track"" (which the title of the song crosses my mind) but even that sounds muddy and dull.Russ Parrish is gone from this release as are most of the cool soloing that you heard on the first Fight album. The songs are just boring, I don't even want to review this any further."
1,"Old schoolers, beware","For me, this was the ""let's pretend that we have been influenced by Stone Temple Pilots and ALice in Chains, so let's try and redo the Temple of the Dog album."" As has already been stated, stick with the first Fight release."
1,This CD is boring,"If I were to describe this Cd in one word, that word would be boring. This is generic heavy metal, with no distinctiveness, and no voice of its own. The guitar is dull and plodding, and lead singer Rod Halford is only using a small portion of the range he showed when he was with Judas Priest."
5,An enlightening read,Dias' ideas are exciting and innovative. I have implemented his ideas in the classroom and have had great success. I would honestly say that his teaching methods should be used by all educators. Bravo!
3,"All right, not great","Having read Stewart's Arthurian saga, and thoroughly enjoyed and admired them, I was a bit disappointed in this book. It is an adventure and mystery novel, with no real magic in it (as exists with Merlin and The Crystal Cave and the rest). I found her writing amateur and struggling, not the masterful work she put forth in the Arthurian saga books.I could picture something of Corfu, and I substituted Ian McKellen for Sir Julian Gale (this was a good character). I liked her descriptions of the old houses and the hidden cellars and passages, the rich rose garden, the dolphin element, but for the most part it felt like a setting, and the characters worked to move the plot along.However, I was touched by some bits of the romance, the tension of the mystery, and the fear of what-if towards the end."
5,WOW!!,"This has become the book that I compare all others to. I was litterally glued to it even after I finished it. I then read all of her other books from the same general time period. I was not disappointed in the least. This was definitely her peak time of writing. The only flaw I can find is that all other books are now ruined for me since none have ever come equal to it since. Mary Stewart, thank you for for sharing your talent with those of us fortunate enough to get a copy of this book."
5,No frills Rock N Roll,"On SWAG, GILBY CLARKE gives us a dose of no frills Rock N Roll that will satisfy any rock fans taste. From start to finish, there isnt any posing by this band, it is guitar driven, in your face rock that will leave you wanting more. We have 11 blistering tracks that will leave their mark on your ears and have you wishing rock music was like this once again. Gilby shows us that he is just more than the former guitar player for GNR, he is a talented musician that knows how to give us some great rocking songs the way rock music should be, no frills, just music full of thrills. You want great music, than listen to these following tracks: ALIEN, MARGARITA, JUDGEMENT DAY, UNDER THE GUN, BROKEN DOWN CAR and a cover of David Bowies DIAMOND DOGS. These are just a few of the killer songs on this CD. Go out and get it know, you will not be disappointed."
2,Not too good,"I bought this album after reading some raving reviews, and even though I'm a huge Guns n Roses fan this album is just not worth the money. The guitar work is ""ok"" the lyrics just plain [stink]. If you want a Gunner solo album chech out the snakepitt, Izzy, Duff or wait for chinnese democracy."
5,Invitation To The Wedding ... hard to get ... VHS tape (no DVD),"Five stars is for the story, not the product. Unfortunately, the tech quality is quite rough around the edges for both audio and visual. HOWEVER, it was watchable and is probably as good as you're going to get--if you can still find it anywhere. Pity it is not on DVD. The story is clever, sweet, and rather engaging. The theme had been lifted and used in later film creations. Five stars is for the story, not the tape."
5,High Action Adventure,"Not knowing what to expect from this title, I found myself falling into the story right away. Rip-roaring adventure, beautiful descriptions, great characters - loved this book. Enjoyed the easy-going writing style and it made me think about how exciting the West must have been for courageous, daring adventurers in the 1800's. Looking for more titles by this author."
4,The little tent that could!,"I received the tent yesterday, and decided to `field test' it in our backyard. The tent was simple to erect, I was especially impressed by the quality of the tent poles (not your cheap fiberglass, but quality machined aluminum) and how the tent was super-compact and lightweight. The temperature plunged to 39 degrees F, and we were very comfortable inside (wearing t-shirts and shorts with only a light blanket. The relative humidity was 97%, yet the ventilation inside is well-designed and there was almost no condensation. I definitely will feel comfortable taking this tent on extended backpacking trips in all sorts of weather. Will probably purchase several others for the kids."
4,4 season tent,i am wrighting this review for the trek 7x7 backpack dome tent. one thing i have to say about it is that the floor is not waterproof but that can be fixed with a tarp the tent is very sturdy.early this year in march i was camping in the snow in the high cascades and a blizzard came in and all through the night there was 67mph winds and it held up good.
2,CAMPER BEWARE!,"Bought this tent from ""WW Bargains"" expecting a water proof floor! NOT!!! Tent must have a ground barrier or you will be wet!Made contact with seller and had a very disapointing respons! Kinda like, to bad so sad, customer service had a very limited and unacceptableresponse to issue at hand!Partially my fault for not asking the right question before ordering. ALWAYS ask first!I will not be doing business with them again!I will not use, nor recommend using, this tent if wet weather is forcasted; however, it does work very well in dry conditions!Hope this is helpfull and have a great campout!FYI, AMAZON IS FABULOUS!Brad"
4,Great stuff!,"3-dis set which contains ""Challenge of the Superfriends: United They Stand"", ""Challenge of the Superfriends: Attack of the Legion of Doom"", and ""Justice League"" (pilot).Good stuff, especially for JLA comic book fans. Kinda irritating that these 2 series are being released piecemeal (and if you find yourselves buying the Justice League 3-pack you will end up having 2 copies of the Justice League pilot!!!!). Anyway am looking forward to buying the season 1/ complete set of ""Challenge of the Superfriends"". Plus am hoping that they come out with season/ boxed sets of Justice League as well."
3,I like Justice League.,"This is a nice collectors pack to have. It has two small volumes of the old school superfriends as well as the Justice League pilot episode. I don't know if I would call the superfriends cartoons ""good,"" but they are fun to watch, and there is commentary on every episode."
1,Whacky UFO Cult,"King claims that he received the 1981 ""Minister of the Year"" award from the International Evangelism Crusades. This group was started by the late Frank E. Stranges. Stranges is also the author of The UFO Conspiracy. Yes. One can see why a UFO believing preacher would award ""Minister of the Year"" to another UFO believing preacher. In 2006 the group awarded Minister of the Year to Julie Stranges. If that last name sounds familiar, it's because she was Stranges' wife. International Evangelism Crusades' standing in the US religious community seems to be lacking. Any organization that uses a Yahoo web mail address as their point of contact does not seem to be a big player. Amusingly, Stranges was also the president of the International Theological Seminary of California, the diploma mill insitution that awarded King his Ph.D."
1,PAUL'S WEAKEST SINGLE RELEASE TO DATE,"The ONLY good thing to say about this song is that it DOES have a melody. But, what is sorely lacking, is in Paul's vocals. He comes across here as a songwriter who can barely find his own melody....falsetto and very weak. I AM VERY glad to say that this is the WEAKEST song on the Drivin' Rain full-length CD...the other 15 tracks are something to listen to. Case in point, NEVER JUDGE A FULL-LENGTH McCARTNEY CD by the 1st single release. This has been a pattern throughout his career...the SINGLES in no way represent the LP's/CD's and the B-sides were always better than the A sides. Only 2 exceptions: ""Another Day"" & ""Mull of Kintyre"""
4,Recommended!,"Costy-L delivers a CD based on traditional blues and rock elements generously seasoned with eastern flavors but consistent in style. A large part of the songs are instrumentals with masterful razor-blade guitar work others feature the intriguing voice of Annie Johnson as the bitter sweet ""Blues Lullaby"" which is one of my favorites. Some are sung by Costy himself.Despite the English lyrics it is quite obvious that this is not an American soul which gets revealed here. Stories fueled by the inner conflicts of the old world, its rich history of beauty and destruction, its heritage of suffering and survival. Songs of despair and hope. Truly a fine piece of work."
2,Poor manufacture,"I returned this item and never actually used it on the grill. It is porceline coated, and two ends of the grilling surface had porceling missing with bare metal exposed. It would have rusted almost immediately. I doubt it would have held up to a barbque spatula. The concept with one solid half is excellent, as well as the three lips and one open end."
4,Track Titles,1. Find it on the wings 2. Holy Lord/Carry on 3. Make it 'til tomorrow (duet with Peabo Bryson) 4. When I heal 5. Where the Nails were 6. Build my world around You 7. If I want to 8. Safe Harbour 9. God is waslking me through 10. Through the eyes of an angel 11. Imagine (how God can sing)
1,THIS SUCKS!,"I WAS HYPED ABOUT THE TITLE, BUT WHEN I WATCHED IT, I WAS SO BORED. THE STORY WAS LAME, THE ""COMEDIC"" PARTS WERE NOT FUNNY AND JUST NOT ENOUGH FIGHTING FOR ME. AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT SHAOLIN AND ANY OF ITS STYLES. WHATEVER YOU DO DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!"
2,nice looking but has problems,"This is an attractive and affordable chrome toilet brush with two problems: 1) the canister lid, which is attached to the brush handle, hits against the toilet bowl rim as you are cleaning because the handle is too short; 2) it's nice that the brush is detachable so you can replace it later, but it detaches from the handle while you are cleaning, which is not so nice. You have to fish it out of the toilet and screw it back on.This is a small-ish brush that looks nice sitting next to the toilet, but if you are going to be cleaning your toilet with it, get a better one. The Oxo brush is not as pretty but it works a lot better."
2,Low Quality Finish,Item purchased in Dec. 2009. Finish looked fine initially. The finish began showing spots soon after I received it and after about 15 months it is now pitted.
1,Defective Product,The brush will not screw into the handle. I originally ordered two and obtained two replacements and all four were defective.
4,Better Looking but a Little Less Functional,"Purchased two of these to use in guest bathrooms, primarily because they look better than the usual plastic models. They do indeed look very nice and like most Gatco products I have purchased are well made and a fair value. However, the handle is pretty short and the brush a little flimsy. The brush does, in the end, work well enough and if a good look is important, it would be a good choice."
5,brass toilet brush holder,"This is the perfect addition to my new bathroom...exactly what i wanted, directions were perfect...looks great too!! very happy with this product!"
4,A word of caution,"Generally - a well written book about Palestine in the 19th century. Very few well documented books are available describing that era and I was interested in the first half of the 19th century in particular. Unfortunately, the book deals mostly with the emergence of the Zionist movement and is written from that perspective. However, I find it lacking by not covering the story as seen from a Muslim or Ottoman point of view.Being out of print makes this book extremely expensive, but I was able to purchase a used copy at reasonable price."
2,Not Very Helpful,"I was really disappointed by this book. It does little to enhance one's understanding of the early church.It would be better to save your money and study the New Testament references to the church. I believe you would end up with a clearer concept of church than what you will read in this book.One of the problems is an overabundance of caution. The author is very non-commital. He says that this could mean this, or this or this and often draws no conclusions and leaves you hanging in midair. I think that he feels it necessary to cover every possible explanation with impartiality and leaves the reader more confused than before.Another thing that bothers me is that while the church is so alive, he describes it in such sterile, technical ways, as you might expect to find in academia. So be it. The book is probably best suited as a seminary textbook, but as a practical resource, it leaves me wanting more."
5,Scholary but accessible--great overview of NT ekklesia,The book really helped me understand Paul's perspective on what the ekklesia was and should be and the cultural setting in which he was writing--which is both fascinating and enlightening. The book also explains the parallels and disimilarities between the OT understanding and practice of freedom and community and the NT understanding and practice of freedom and community. You can get a good idea of what is covered by the title chapters. Gender equality is not the main focus of the book but addressed as well. I HIGHLY recommend the book. It is scholarly while still be accessible.
5,Comprehensive Help for Novice and Experienced Writers,"""...a carefully worked gem of a reference book, packed with facts, advice and common sense on the ins and outs of the writing business that you'll find nowhere else."""
2,Can't get lids on...,"Okay, these are cute and I love Tupperware, but I could have bought several other products for A LOT less money and probably been more satisfied. I am feeling like I paid for the ""NAME BRAND"" of these popsicle molds. They are really cute and the perfect size for a toddler, but I have to work WAY too hard to get the lids on and as a mom of a toddler, I don't have the patience to mess with a popsicle lid for 15 minutes. They have to snap on and I need to get on with things! I wouldn't buy this product again and am seriously considering returning it."
1,Beware if you own an older KitchenAid 18 model,"You might have ordered the KitchenAid 4318938 and received the W10165296RP as the substitute since KitchenAid has discontinued the 4318938. It is extremely difficult to get them to fit since they are a bit smaller. You really need to work to stretch it to fit. The other disappointment is the button holes in the bag do not align with the buttons on the compactor, so forget about buttoning it in and concentrate all your efforts on getting it to fit. Oh and they're thinner too.As another reviewer noted, the Whirlpool W10165296RP IS NOT a substitute for the Kitchenaid 18"" 4318938 bag.Someone told me the Viking bags may fit and they're supposedly thicker. I'll try those after I go through the 45 W10165296RP's that I am now stuck with, if I have any fingers left."
1,Kitchenaid 4318938 NOT SAME as Whirlpool W10165296RP,"If you are looking for a large compactor bag to fit an 18"" compactor such as the Electrolux IKON, the Whirlpool W10165296RP IS NOT a substitute for the Kitchenaid 18"" 4318938 bag. Evidently the Kitchenaid product is no longer available and the Whirlpool bag is substituted (by all vendors I believe). The Whirlpool 18"" bag is smaller than the Kitchenaid and is NOT an adequate substitute as it does not fit compactors such as the Electrolux (whereas the Kitchenaid bag did). So, bear that in mind if you are actually trying to buy the Kitchenaid bag."
2,Dreadful Read,Secret Santa is about a group of teenagers.The main character is Djuna Dufarge a popular girl who decides to throw a christmas party on her family's island.The invatation says it's a Secret Santa Bash.Once on the island scary things begin to happen to the group of kids she has invited.Then people begin to disappear.The reason I did'nt like the book was the plot was hard to follow and the endding was weak.If your looking for a scary read look somewhere else.
4,A pretty good book,This book was good. It wasn't one of my favorites and I'm in no big hurry to reread it. It was a good story line and worth reading. I liked it. Read this book.
4,ok..now this is more like it.,"In my review of the first BloodRayne I listed some things that I thought the first one lacked..like graphic consistency. There were other things I wished the first game had as well. Lik eI thought that it was a shame that your perspective was only behind Rayne..since her character model was the best..but I also thought that the action was too focused around guns..and not enough blade action was going on. Also I thought that in the first game, Rayne herself seemed very stiff with alot of her motions. In what I've seen for myself of this newer version all this has improved, and the control of Rayne herself had improved GREATLY. It's now fun just to run around, jump and slash objects, let alone play the game. So this game no longer feels like a vampiric version of Max Payne, but more of it's own game ok..so the borrowed a little from Prince of Persia..but I think it's awesome. I can't wait to see how this series continues to develop."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,This video is the biggest of all rip offs. It's about four minutes of very annoying music set to photos showing nothing at all. The camera zooms continually in and out on the nothing photos till you want to scream. This piece of trash should be removed by Amazon immediately.
5,Ron Santo: Cub Forever,"Ron Santo should have a special place in every Cub fan's heart. Beyond that, this documentary should remind all bseball fans what the game is really about. Very few players these days exhibit the love of the game more than Ronny. In a day when money rules where players want to play, Santo shows how one man can truly love the city he plays for. This film proves beyond a doubt why Santo belongs in the Hall of Fame. It proves why Santo is the greatest Cub fan in history. It proves that no one bleeds Cubbie blue like Ronny.Outside of the baseball context, this movie shows the power of the human spirit and a man's will to not only survive, but to inspire others to do the same. The footage of Ron coping with what diabetes has done to him will move even the most stoic person to tears. It is hard not to well up throughout this movie.An essential for Cub fans, an essential for baseball fans, and a heart-warming story for those who just want to see the power of human will."
2,Hall of Fame in the hearts of Cub fans,Incredible determination by an athlete who honors the sport of baseball. His heart and guts are beautifully portraid by his son and is a tribute to a courageous Dad--an inspiration to all who may be tempted to give up a quality of life threatening struggle. Hurray for Number 10 and his loving family!
5,The real story about jockeys,"As a person who has worked at the track and owned, trained, and raced Thoroughbreds, I can say that this video is the real deal. Great movie, very enlightening for the non-professional. The added bonus dvd is something every Thoroughbred trainer should view again and again."
4,"Tough, great size.","These flip-top boxes are not only a great, handy size, the quality is far greater that the flip-top boxes you find at Home Depot or Costco. These things are masde of a more forgiving plastic (and thicker) than the usual see-though type. Only wish they came in a variety of colors. 4 instead of 5 stars because the finish on the edges could be nicer (smoother, less sharp.)"
4,I didn't think the old guy had it in him!,"After the CDs he released in the 1990s, I figured all Barry could do is to interpret other people's songs. Boy was I wrong! Barry wrote or cowrote every song on this one and many of the songs hearken back to his very earliest work (before ""I Wrote The Songs""). I have a feeling he spent a long, long time getting the songs for this album and making them sound just right. ""Turn the Radio Up"" and ""They Dance!"" are two infectious uptempo tunes that would have been big hits in his 70s/80s heyday. ""Freddie Said"" really swings! Highly recommended."
5,Manilow's best yet.,"Okay, folks. This is it. ""Here at the Mayflower"",Barry Manilow's new CD, is DELICIOUS! Andvery generous, with 16 cuts (17 with the extrabonus track) Barry reminds you of all he iscapable of. His voice is the best I've heard it,youthful, powerful, subtle, and sexy.The tracks take you from smooth jazz, to Broadwayflavor, to a Latin twist, pop, and disco!And he changes gears effortlessly and successfully.This entire CD is almost entirely a solo effort,in that he composed, arranged, and conducted everysong, put lyrics to many, and played 50% of theinstruments. All of his efforts pay off, too.It's wonderful. And the storyline that runsthroughout the music, which is basically whatis going on behind certain doors of the ""Mayflower""apartments, is very clever, and helps to pullyou into the lyrics. Open up your mind anddo yourself a favor...get this CD."
3,Not bad but....,"Having been a Manilow fan since the start I anticipated a brand new studio album (of Manilow standards) for years. I started out wondering after hearing about it...it was another ""concept"" album. Maybe I prejudged it but I wanted an album of songs and maybe one that became the album's title like Even Now. Turn the Radio up was what I wanted to hear. And that was about it. I am still listening to it but I feel it's lacking something? Maybe it's the music itself? It has more ""horns"" than the old standard of piano, drums and guitars of Manilow past. Even though I am a fan and always will be a great fan I think the album is not what I expected. Give it a listen though and see for yourself!"
5,Manilow is on top again,"Being a 26 year ""fan"" of Barry Manilow's I was eagerly awaiting his new CD, ""Here at the Mayflower,"" and with it's first playing found it to be all and more in my expectations. Manilow has woven a tale with the music in this CD. With each song, Barry pours out such emotion. His creative ""juices"" were certainly flowing with the music and lyrics whether his own or in collaboration. With Manilow's switch to a new record company, Concord Records, you can experience his creative talents more than ever, especially in ""Freddie Said"" and ""They Dance!"" I have had the CD less than 24 hours and am on my 3rd playing of it. I can't wait to here these songs performed in a concert setting. Manilow is back better than ever before!"
2,A huge disappointment,"I bought this CD on recommendation of other reviewers here, and I have to say that I'm VERY disappointed. It's not as if I'm not a Manilow fan, so I knew what style of music to expect. On the other hand, the title track is the only one I really liked, and only one of three on the whole CD that I found even listenable. (The other two I could tolerate were ""Freddy Said"" and ""The Night Tito Played."") I kept listening, thinking some of the other songs would grow on me, but they never did."
4,Barry's Back,"Barry is finally back to the basics. He has written and produced the whole album. Best cuts are "" Talk To Me"", ""I Miss You"", and "" She Should'a Been Mine"". The best cut, ""Shadow Man"" is only available on the limited edition. It is a shame. It is the strongest cut. This is Barry's finest CD since ""Paradise Cafe"". Barry has passion in his voice again. A must for any fan."
4,Interesting project--noteworthy songs,"Manilow provides a ""voice"" for several of the tenants in the Mayflower building, providing insight into the human condition. A variety of topics and musical styles are represented here, all linked by proximity, but not necessarily anything else. Together, the songs reflect the experience of living in an apartment building, and explores the surreality of living so close to people you don't know very well or at all. Some tenants are lonely, some determined to make change, some tell intense love stories, and some are just melancholy, but each song gains depth from being on the album with the others. It's worth a listen, and some songs are very special."
5,Manilow's brilliant comeback album,"Here at the Mayflower is Barry's first original album in 20 years, and it proves that he's the most underrated singer/songwriter in the world! In this CD, there's something for everyone...upbeat,feel-good songs like Turn the Radio Up and They Dance, super-cool, funky songs like Do You Know Who's Living Next Door and Come Monday, sentimental tear-jerkers likeI Miss You and Talk to Me, and smooth jazz numbers like I Hear Her Playing Music and Some Bar by the Harbor. Every song on the CD is an absolute gem - it's the perfect album to chill out to with a nice glass of wine!"
2,Turn This CD Down,Although the song Turn Up The Radio is typical Manilow with some energy most of the other songs lack energy and are very downbeat
5,The best resource on Guild,"Guild experts call this book ""The Bible."" This volume covers Guild through 1977. (A second volume is forthcoming.) It contains more of the important details about Guild through 1977 than all other sources combined. It's as informative as an encyclopedia. Yet it's also a readable history plus an anthology of great photos."
4,The Guild Guitar Book,"Very interesting and well done, however it leaves out Guild proto-types and small model runs as the FS-46 which I have and could not find in the book."
2,I agree. It couldn't be better.,made with Good concepts for kids but poorly + poorly made.Didn't like music at all. sometimes no sounds at all.
4,Good DVD,"I only gave this DVD a 4 out of 5 stars because it didn't hold my 3 year old son's attention. I'm thinking maybe he just didn't like it. I watched the DVD to evaluate it. The content is there and I do like the teaching method but kids will be kids... My son just didn't like it. He showed preference to BumbleBee's Opposites DVD. However, I still do recommend it based on the fantastic content. It may work for someone else:)"
3,Knuth's eccentricity discourages beginners,"I found that Knuth's reputation for eccenctricity gets in the way of actually getting to the meat of the book. For example, getting the programs to compile under Windows was not as straightforward as it could be (although not that difficult). Much harder was to get used to the idea of using CTANGLE and CWEB in order to get Graphbase to a state where you can actually compile it.It does not help at all that Chapter 3 of the book is when how to install Graphbase is actually discussed. Just for these alone I have to give the book a 3 star rating. Perhaps I will change this once I have had the opportunity peruse the _real_ contents of the book."
2,Eh...,"Don't let the picture fool you there is only two pieces. but then again I suppose I need to read the description a little better next time I buy. Not a bad gift mind you just a little pricey for just holding four rods.. and there are no pre made drill holes, so your going to have to figure out how to mount it yourself. So basically all you get is two blocks of wood in a bag."
3,Calder Pride,"Having read the other Calder stories, I felt this one lacked the character depth of the previous stories. It's obvious that another book is due out regarding Ty & Jessy Calder as neither character developed well in this part of the saga. I wonder when the next will be and if it will tie all the loose threads left by Calder Pride. ie. The results of those shot: Ty, Cully, and Rollie; The birth of Ty & Jessy's child; Sally & Chase's relationship; Emma's part in the kidnapping, etc."
4,Entertaining,"Cat lost her true love at the young age of 20. Feeling lonely she meets a stranger who reminds her of her lost love and ends up with a night of passion. Not knowing who each other is they go their seperate ways. Five years later, Cat has a beautiful son and no husband. Enter the new sheriff, who wants his son. This story has all the twists and turns as the previous Calder series books. It was nice revisiting the family that won our hearts."
5,Great keeps me comimg back for more,This is a great read. Dailey's Calder series is one of the first I ever read. This is one of the best books yet. Her writing of todays problems in life and how people are handling them and the feelings jump right off the page. I just love it.
2,Disappointing,"While Calder Pride has all the earmarks of another excellent Calder saga in the first half of the book, it soon fell flat. It was exciting and gripping all the way up until the main characters marry, in a way that I felt was totally unbelievable. Then suddenly with very little interaction between them, she's in love with him? Again, not plausible. And finally, the book eneded abruptly, as if Ms. Dailey suddenly lost interest. There was so much more that could have been done with this story, I was definitely disappointed."
3,Not the best Calder series,"I didn't like Cat's character very much even though Dailey protrayed her a strong woman. I thought she was a bit spoiled and selfish. She did not deserve Logan's love. I thought Logan, Chase, and Quint were great characters. I look foward to her next series."
2,The Calder Saga very Missed,"I just recently read the previous 4 in this series and enjoyed them very much. Maybe I expected too much of the last one because of this, but I felt that this book left out much of the plot of the previous books. Along with the feel of Montana and the Calder Range, it left out alot of the topics that I followed thru the previous storylines and I missed them. Janet Daily tells wonderful stories, though, and I hope to see more of them from this series someday."
5,Calder Series of Books,"I purchased this book because I had collected the Calder series years ago and didn't know that Janet had written more books to add to it. When I saw that there were more books, that had the Calder theme, I decided that I wanted them too. I have started to read Calder Pride, it is interesting and keeps you wanting to turn the pages to see what will happen next. Riviting. I would recommend this book, even if you don't follow the series, because it will keep you spellbound even read by itself."
2,over it,"Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago. Also, I am so over Ben Franklin. So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway. I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book. Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book. As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me. In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber."
4,Very quick reading,"Dover thrift books are cheap and easy to take anywhere. I would not recommend them for scholarly work in the least. But, they are good for a leisurely read.The Wit and Wisdom is a collection of aphorisms taken from the the pages of the almanack. In terms of background information, there is some (minimal) biographical information about Benjamin Franklin and even less information on the almanack.The adages are aranged by general subject. Some of the aphorisms will seem familiar since a couple are repeated in the book under different subject headings.I like that the book gives you some quick words of wisdom which can still be applicable today. It also gives one a brief glimpse of what the late 1700s thought of as important or problematic.It is worth the dollar."
5,Poor Richard's Almanac,"Poor Richard's Almanac is a well known collection of Benjamin Franklin's writings. I have read it many times. I wanted to have a hard copy for myself and this is it. I think the best advice he gives is to consider yourself as your own employee. Are you prompt, industrious, do you do the most important things first, and so forth. If a person adopts this attitude, one does not put off jobs that can be done now. Any time wasted is gone forever. We are given only so much time. We cannot afford to waste any of it."
3,Book Review,This is a very short book. It is a collection of wise sayings that were popular during the author's lifetime. They are not profound.
5,Ben's wisdom,Ben's wisdom (or interpretation) are unmistakeable. Wonderful to look at inside and out.
5,PoorRichards Almanack,"Timeless. I read at least a page a day and when I get to the end, start again."
4,American Colonial Wisdom,"Benjamin Franklin has indeed given us a great treasure to enjoys for centuries to come. Poor Richard's Almanack is full of funny and wise sayings filled with historical value. Some hold true to their time and others speak of institutions like marriage, disipline and business in which not much has changed. I compare it with chinesse proverbs. This book included corky illustations that depict what would come to mind when reading such phrases in those days."
3,Another money maker . . .,Publisher selected some entries from Poor Richard and reprinted them with some preliminary paragraphs by some well known names in comedy writing/performance. A sure money maker. Not much there there except for the publisher/distributers. Great for that low cost gift in a hurry . . . where time and intent are thin or nil.
4,Pseudonym.,"Yes, Dr. Franklin gave his sage advice under a pen name but when it became sucessful owned up to it. The things you remember your mother telling you, really were his. Only as much sex as is healthy, and so forth and so on."
1,A Shameful Book!,"The authors and publishers should be ashamed. Helen Kellers's life was NOT simply filled with ""silence and darkness"", as the authors write. She was a fighter for women's rights, including the right to vote. She denounced the murder of coal miners by John D. Rockefeller. She helped found the American Civil Liberties Union. She worked tirelessly for peace. She lived a long, full NOISY 88 years.This book reduces her to a permanent teenager, and an image on a postage stamp. This book misinforms young people, and gives them a ridiculous idea of what Helen Keller was really all about."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"This is a reprint of a fine out of print Smithsonian Monograph by H. I. Chapelle. It's labeled a ""high quality paperback"".What in fact it is is a scan of the text in the monograph, including the captions of the wonderful Chapelle photos and drawings in the original monograph. The problem is the photographs and drawings from the original are completely missing and the reprint is nearly valueless without them. Perhaps the paper is high quality, nothing else is. It's not even worth the $1.96."
1,No illustrations included,This is a wonderful rendition of the original except for the fact that the numerous original illustrations and plans that are essential to the volume are not included.
2,text only,"Lack of drawings and diagrams in Kindle book made it practically useless reading, as mentioned in previous revue. . ."
5,Invaluable,Invaluable! I love this book. I have been studying Chinese for years and I can always learn something new from this book. It helped me when I was beginner and still helps me now :)
3,Not comprehensive enough for the advanced user,"I would recommend this book for the beginning to intermediate student of Chinese. For the advanced student, especially trying to find out the various usages of more literary forms and grammar, I would not recommend this book.I'feel that too much was wasted on a phrasebook style second half that could have been spent on more grammar (this book does not contain all grammar that you will see in Chinese, not even close). What about all the usages of '' ' isn't even in the index. I did not buy this book and expect to get half of it as a phrasebook. I expected a thorough treatment of all of Chinese grammar and I didn't find it here. I plan on selling my copy for a more comprehensive grammar."
3,Was a good book in its day but very outdated now,"This book helped me a lot when I first was learning about using CSS instead of tables to design websites, but unless you find this book in your local library or something, I don't think it's worth buying it now and certainly not at the $30+ it's listed for because it's simply outdated. It still has many examples of using tables to create websites which nobody uses any more. The templates tht come with it are outdated too and made for the older monitors with very little resolution. I could go on, but you get the picture."
2,Leaves something to be desired,"As a Web professional, I'm always interested in reviewing the work of my peers, seeing what I can learn from them. I visited the author's Web site and perused his portfolio since a look inside the book wasn't available here, and I was more than a little disappointed. The integration of his CSS/XHTML is flawed and it just doesn't display the way it should on the major operating system/browser combinations that it should. With this in mind, any advice from the doesn't hold much water for me. I was most interested in this book as a source of inspiration, and have found the Taschen series much more to my liking."
5,Decide for yourself,"I found the book to be absolutely fantastic. Not only does it offer sound tecnical advice, but it also provides amazing templates that a couple of my clients have truly been amazed by.Design, however, is very subjective. The best advice I can offer is what was suggested to me by a fellow designer. Go to Mr. Eccher's site (a5design.com) and decide for yourself whether the designs are for you. What you see on the templates and portfolio pages is exactly the quality of work you'll get with the book."
1,Disappointing,"After searching for a product to aid in my swimming workouts, was very disappointed in the H20 audio sv-mini. While the unit did keep its word in keeping my ipod mini dry, the sound quality was horrible and the volume barely detectable. Don't bother."
5,"Important, Essential Work","This book is a landmark that marks a sea change in the way Hawaiian history is understood. All Hawaiian history books written after this one must include discussion of Dr. Silva's findings. If they don't, they are inadequate, deficient and indeed, biased for omitting this information. This book also marks a change in the language of politics. Knowing that one's own ancestors signed a petition gives great strength to the continuing struggle for sovereignty. This book is essential for anyone living in Hawai'i who wants to begin to understand the depth of the commitment of Hawaiians to restoration of their independence and dignity."
4,Three out of Four,Watching these films brought back memories. Seeing these strong heroes on the screen brought back old feelings of pride. Hot Potato was a dud though.Where have films like these gone?
5,Urban Action,"If you don't have this dvd step as part of your collection its a most have!! Non stop action and the remember when factor goes into effect when you think back to how fashion was and how fashion is today not a far leap, lots of fun:)"
1,three the hardway,"this dvd was not of quality, it looked as though it had been copied over and over from a vhs tape. if i could have, i would have returned it. thank you"
4,Horrific Shippingl,"The item itself was great the packaging was good as well,but the shipping was horrible. I purchased the dvd (1) item on the 26th or 28th of Feb and it arrived almost three weeks later for just one dvd? I will never order from that company again. The other items I ordered on the same day all came a week later (standard shipping)hope this helps."
2,Does ANYONE have an UNCUT version Three the Hard Way?!,"Dang it! The theme song scene is missing! Also, this is NOT widescreen as advertised. I ordered this DVD with great anticipation, because I've been looking for Three the Hard Way for years. And everytime I found a copy, it turned out to be missing the scene after Jim Kelly's fight with bad cops -- where the three heroes are being followed by assassins, while the theme song ""Three the Hard Way"" is featured.I saw the clip on YouTube years ago, so I know it exists. Why would anyone mass produce a chopped version of a cult classic? Do these folks actually have the ""legitimate"" master copy... or even watch the movies pre-production?If anyone knows where I can find an UNCUT copy of Three the Hard Way. PLEASE let me know! (Thanks!)"
4,70's style,"I like black belt jones, Jim kelly is awesome. It's 70's style movies so, you have to have that in your mind before you watch them. Black samson was very entertaining and i really liked it. Three the hard way is just plain badass! I'm a film student who wants to become a director one day, i hope i can remake a movie like three the hard way. Hot potato sucks!. It sad that there are 3 great movies and the 4th one has to suck."
2,Not a complete version of Three The Hard Way,"Purchased this primarily to get a dvd copy of the classic Three The Hard Way. I have an old vhs copy and the clarity is poor with night scenes being almost black. Was happy to find this copy was clear and fairly well done. However, an entire scene has been removed! What the hell?! It is the scene with the Impressions title song . How absurd is that? Outrageous and disappointing."
4,Good book for Bonnie and Clyde fans,"Mr. Phillips is currently considered the foremost authority on Bonnie and Clyde, and for good reason. He is also the editor of Blanche Barrow's recently published memoirs (GREAT). I enjoyed the detail included in this book. His premise is that Clyde was driven in his life of crime by his desire to raid Eastham Prison - one of the worst prisons in Texas. As an historian myself and huge Bonnie and Clyde fan, I would have to say that the raid on Eastham was certainly a part of Clyde Barrow's larger plan (if indeed he had one), but not the sole driving factor. I also appreciate the fact that Mr. Phillips was able to interview Ralph Fults face-to-face, but Mr. Fults seemed to be a bit-part player in the story of Bonnie and Clyde. All in all this book was worth the read - the research is incredible and many former publications' myths and mistakes are straightened out."
3,Running with Bonnie and Clyde,"Good Story, with lots of good facts, fairly accurate except for the events surrounding Bonnie and Clyde's actual death . This book uses the Bonnie and Clyde movie version of the bloody ending. This is not the way it happened, but I still recommend this book. The book portray's several events that give that feeling you can actally see it all happening. Great book!"
3,Running with Bonnie and Clyde,"Great Story! Lots of facts, pretty accurate except for Bonnie and Clyde's death. This book uses the movie Bonnie and Clyde version of their fatal end. This is not the way it happened."
3,A little disappointed,"After reading the Blanche Barrow book, the James R. Knight and the E.R. Milner book I have to admit I was a little disapponinted in this one. I found it to be very self-serving. After all, these people were common criminals who chose to make a life of robbery and violence. Mr. Fults wanted to project the idea that it was solely the corruption of the Texas penal sytem that was most to blame for the lives of the badmen of the era. Also, he constantly surrounded himself with vicious violent men; yet he wants us to beleive that even though he was willing to kill and came close several times, he was basically innocent and an honorable man.One last point that confused me. In all the other books, Ray Hamilton was portrayed as afraid of, and loathed by, Joe Palmer. In this books, supposedly they are best of pals and are comforted in the fact that they are executed at the same time. There just seems to be more than a few inconsistancies in thsi book."
5,good read,"This is a very interesting story about JK's path through the entertainment biz. It is very well written and fun to read. The stories ring true and JKs personality seems to come through. I've enjoyed the JK Experiment series a lot, so it's a treat to find out more about who he is. Definitely recommended for anyone who has seen his show."
4,This is a very enjoyable read!,"I watched his show JKX for a few seasons and my wife and I found the show to be VERY funny. The best bits are the folks who apply for the paper delivery job and the skit with the driving instructor. In my opinion the all time best was when he had the mexican day laborers over for his birthday party.Anyway, this book shows the struggles and nonsense that he went through before getting on TV. It is well written and doesn't really gloss over the nonsense he had to put up with.And there is a message in here but you'll have to read the book"
5,Y'all betta recognize...,"Jamie Kennedy's show is what I know him best by. I'm so glad he wrote this book and gave us a little inside of his life. He's such an honest, and open book. What a fascinating character he is, in everything he does. I actually tend to look up to him and base my actions on him and others like him, never being afraid to show my inner self (read my profile here at Amazon if you don't believe me). Life is too short, and if you don't reach out and take Life, it won't be taken. That seems to be his ""take on life.""I highly recommend this book and this lifestyle. It will truly rock your world!MC White said: Check it out!!!"
3,decent book,I got this book to prepare for college chemistry but it would be better suited for preparing for high school chemistry.
2,"Ok, but dry","As a struggling college student in chemistry I decided to take a time and look through a few Chemistry books. The book keeper that was there suggested this one. Its ok, but its kind of bland for my tastes. It constists of the following order a short explaination, followed by a question and answer sequence. Pesronally I believe this book is good for the extra practice or possibly brushing up on chemistry skills but its not recommended for those students who are struggling."
5,Exactly what it promises,"This book will just do what it promises: teach you the basics of chemistry. This is tailored so that even one who knows nothing about chemistry can learn (and even if he is a bit dumb!). Lately, the price is very low."
3,"Great Format, Needs Editing","I bought this book 2 weeks ago after reading a couple other chemistry text. I have learned more in those 2 weeks than I did reading other text (specifically C-K12).But I can only give it 3 stars. There are errors in almost every chapter. Some are not important (wrong page references) some can impact your ability to learnchemistry (such as auric being called gold(II) at one point and gold(III) at another). If you want a no nonsense approach to boot strapping your chemistry study,this is a good book. But don't skim it, or you are apt to get some wrong answers in your chem lab."
3,Pretty good book,"Useful information for someone who had chemistry 37 years ago and now taking it again. The information was pretty clear and the actual problems are easy to work. I got this book along with another one, and my ""fears"" were resolved before I even started the class."
2,Chemistry Self Teaching Guide,I really did not like this book because it puts the answers to questions right under the question which makes it difficult to study without seeing the answers. I would have preferred the answers to be in the back of the book. This really does not help me at all.
5,Chemistry: Concepts and Problems: A Self-Teaching Guide,"I found this book very helpful in preparing for my teacher certification test to teach high school science. The concepts were presented in language that was easy to understand. The ""fill-in-the-blank"" format throughout the text helped to reinforce concepts. It helped me recall a great deal of Chemistry that I had learned in college years ago. Overall, an excellent book."
1,"Better as a chemistry review, not a source book","I was trying to find a decent introductory book on chemistry as a refresher. Textbooks go for $150 these days, and this looked like a good choice. Be aware that it has very little explanation in it. It is primarily lists of questions with the correct answer displayed under the question. Not helpful at all for someone who has never had a chemistry course, and it is certainly not a self-teaching guide.Had this book been named and described accurately, I would not have bought it and would not have given it a rating of one star."
1,Not medium at all kinda small and in two pieces.,"Unfortunetly the picture lies about this item. Mine arrived as two pieces and they were only about 4""x5"" and there was no way to put them together becuase they were completely opposite from the other. I might give it a second chance and see what shows up this time."
2,Too Small,"This pot was much smaller than I expected and wouldn't sit on my burner without falling over. Sadly to say, I returned it."
4,Just a good saw,"I found this saw easy to assemble. The extension plates ran out about .020"" from main table, but I feel that is a petty issue. The Biesemeyer fence is easy to read and accurate. I especially appreciate the on/off switch. It's location and ease of use is quite helpful. The adjustment hardware is tight. When I bought this saw the website said that this motor required a 40 amp slowburn fuse, which I installed. Upon getting the saw I found that it is a 20 amp motor. I found this frustrating, but I guess I can't fault the saw for that. The motor is quite strong. I can't think of why you would need more than than this delivers.I also don't have a dust collection system, and found it best just to leave the side cover off - just because it fills up so fast with dust. The blades that come with the saw are good quality.In short, the negatives are petty, the strengths are great, and I'm happy with it."
3,Great LCD Display and good close-ups,"I received this camera for Christmas last year as a gift. It has a beautiful large LCD display in the back! The best I've seen so far. The camera takes great close-up pictures and is really easy to use.My only complaints though are that indoors, even w/ a flash if you zoom in and it's not really bright, the pictures are awful and dark. Also the camera is kind of slow. With a child you need a camera that takes a picture really fast and it seems that w/ this one I tend to miss a lot of shots."
2,Be careful buying these plate covers...keep in mind the unusual shapes.,"I thought I had made a great discovery with these bright, pretty ceramic covers...until they arrived and I went to install them. The unusual shape means they will not necessarily cover the hole in the wall. I ordered a lot of them without realizing that and had to return every one because they did not cover the holes in the walls. I was very disappointed. If the manufacturer would make them a little bit bigger it would solve the problem."
4,Something About General Sherman We Didn't Know About,"Madelaine de Montalia, the former lover of Comte de St. Germain, returns to San Francisco of the 19th Century and finds herself involved with a young army officer named William T. Sherman. They are seperated and, after many adventures in the American West, Madelaine encounters her beau again, in Georgia of all places. I'm somewhat unconvinced that Sherman would have taken a French vampire lady into his bed, but the book is a good read nevertheless."
2,Gratutious and Sketchy,"I found this book to be one of the weakest in the series, if not the weakest of them all. Madelaine just doesn't have what it takes to be a strong character, or at least we haven't seen it yet.The style of this book seems like Ms. Yarbo had a lot of information but no way to bring it all into a story. Research on the native American Indian tribes before their ways were lost - mentioned as the reason for Madelaine to come to America but then nothing. Journal entries to cover months and months of time - literary device for plot exposition. Staying in America during the Civil War - just not good common sense.I don't look for great literature in this series. I like her attention to details and her ability to give the flavor and feeling for the times. But this one was just .. boring. At least Olivia had spirit - Madelaine has ennui."
4,an exciting story and easy to understand,Last month I read Witches Don't do backflips which was about four kids who are starting to take gym and what makes this story fun to read is to find out if the gym teacher is a witch.
3,"Pretty good, but that good","For a Bailey school book, this one is pretty good, but not that good. At least it has someone besides Liza who figures out what the grown up is. Bailey school kids books would be good if they didn't all follow the same pattern. The most frustrating thing about a Bailey School book is that they never give you the climax. One minute they're telling you about how one of the kids is getting cornerd by the grownup, and the next there telling you about the week after that!!!! It is sooo anoying!"
5,The Best Book Ever,"You should read Witches Don't Teach Gymnastics because it is magical and exciting. It's magical because when Liza left her gym bag she had to go back to the gym, and then she saw Ms.Brewbaker making a position. It's exciting because when Eddie, Melody, Howie, and Liza find out that Ms.Brewbaker is an actual witch. You should read this book because it is wonderful and amazing"
2,Not my dream course,I found plenty of materials. I found very clear instructions on how to do the exercise.I just failed to follow the instructions with all my desire and passion to improve phonetics. I am 45. Speak English fluently. Native Russian speaker.Not looking for fun. I just cannot believe it is not possible to improve phonetics without torturing a student.
1,Not the best resource if you want to understand rules of the language,"I have tried two products, and to be honest this one didn't fulfill my expectations at all. So, if you really want to learn and improve your accent and understand the rules of the language at the same time don't buy this product. The narrative is tooooo fast, so you have to pause like every 10 seconds which doesn't help at all especially when you try to concentrate. The information in the book is too extensive, and change subjects too fast. I don't recommend this product, unless your accent just need a ""little work"". As ESL person, didn't work for me !!"
1,NOOOOOOOOOOO,"I have received the book with the CDs in good conditions, but when I checked the first CD I found out is not what you expect to benefit from it."
4,Hello - when to be getting package in the postoffice ?,"Hello, Seems like good books from reviews, but my copy is not yet in my postoffice..I am checking everyday.I have ordered this certain item to become very fluent in the american ways of talking including but not limited to the accent, so on my journey i can communicate well.So basically..good book i think, but will let you know when i have gotten it...the copy has not come.the importance of good accent and correct way of saying the things cannot be underestimated.Regards, Gatum"
5,Fantastic,this is the book we should recommand to any one willing to learn or to improve their english. Believe me.
3,Helpful But Hard,"This book offered me a good insight into how to change my accent to sound more like an American. The book is well written and took me through the steps one-by-one. My success, however, was moderate. First, accent reduction is not for the lazy. You must work very hard. Second, I had no way to know when I was getting an intonation or pronunciation wrong. I found I was spending a lot of time practicing and, at times, I was reinforcing the wrong thing. Although the book was helpful, I found I really had to work with a competent accent reduction teacher to make significant improvement."
3,Great book but CDs are incomplete,"I think this is a good book for non-English native speaker. I'm practicing and hoping it can help me improve my spoken English. You can find a lot of good points in this book from other customers' review.One thing that bothers me is that CDs skip several explanatory paragraphs from the book. There are important techniques or examples in those missing parts too. I don't know if it is intentional or not. But it smoothly proceeds to the next section. I did ask the author by email given in the book but no any response. Yet, all exercises are still in CDs."
5,really good,"very good training. she explains very well and give us enough material to train and develop.. comes with colorful pens and a mirror, yeeee"
4,One of the greatest books I've ever seen.,The weak point I have is pronounciation. This book provides answers to my questions about accent and make me understand how English is pronounced. Thank you Ann Cook :-)
4,Great to improve English speaking,"I started from a very low expectaion, but soon found it very helpful. I am not aiming at acquring American accent since I am living far way from the State and have many friends who are more familiar with British accent. But, Cook's instruction helped me a lot to be more sensitive to intonation and stress of English words and sentences, and now I can speak even more clearly. I do not speak fast, but getting louder and practicing stress pattern already made a great difference. I recommend it to especially those who have difficulty in properly ""speaking up"" for some reasons."
2,Book is pretty good BUT CDs are cutted off,"I bought this training course to improve my American Accent.but some explanations and exercices of pronunciations are cutted off on the recording session.The publisher explained to me CDs of 80 minutes don't exist and they must have cut 8 minutes per CD. It's false. You can buy them (700MB CD-R) everywhere in the world (700 MB= 80 minutes)I think it's more than problematic to publish an oral training where it lacks 8 minutes per CD. You cannot listen to the good pronunciations for many important expressions or words. And you bought it to LISTEN AND NOT TO READ ONLYThat's why I mark this ""oral"" training with just 2 stars."
1,Ineffective for ESL Students,THis book is no use for students of ESL. It appears that only people who live in the States can use it. Acquiring an american accent outside the US can make you sound like a wiredo!! Not recommened for ESL students.I have found several langunge programs on the Web. Most of them are better.
5,American Accent Training,"If you are looking for a book to improve your skills with speaking and pronouncing American English, then this is the book for you. The text comes with the CD-ROM that goes through everything written in the book, then provides space for the student to repeat back what has been said if the student is working on his or her own. However, it is also quite useful as a text for in-class work and one-on-one tutoring to help non-native speakers improve their American accent, with the CD-ROM providing supplemental training opportunities for the really motivated student.The emphasis in Ann Cook's approach is to practice the vocal patterns associated with standard American English, rather than to focus on the exactly correct and distinct pronounciation of each word. In the process, students start sounding more natural to the native speakers around them, thereby increasing the students' confidence in the skills they are learning."
3,"CD 2x defect, speaks too fast","This book is well written and gives you motivation to learn. But:- the author speaks too fast - not that it's hard to understand, but we learn better if we start slowly (same for music). My mother tongue is french, and I speak all the time way too fast. To my french friends: this is not going to help.- the book starts with intonation (also a great problem for french people) and to my point of view, it should be more systematic, starting with vowels in detail. Anyway, the part with the table and vowels was missing on the CD, I had to return it twice.I ended up by buying ""Mastering the American Accent"" (Lisa Mojsin). I made a great progress already after 1 week. Good book for french students (on devrait commencer ca dès l'école, notre accent est toujours une catastrophe, mais ouf, les anglophones trouvent ca sexy ;-)."
1,useless incompetent misleading book,"I purchased this book hoping to learn American pronunciation. My background: Previously I have been studying British pronunciation for 2 years and know the subject. In the United States I have been studying American pronunciation with a private tutor for almost one year.About the book: The book mixes the sounds together which are infact completely different sounds. Therefore it is not consistent. For example page 75: the words ""talk"", ""chalk"", ""pawn"" are in the same pronunciation column as words ""bond"", ""hot"", ""con"". But the pronunciation of those two groups is different!!!!I will not go through all other things, but there are quite few of them.And the biggest disadvantage of the book is: the IPA is not used here. The author invented her own phonetic transcription (with umlauts, and other fancy symbols), which are used.Conclusion: If you want to study American Pronunciation professionally - never buy this book!!!"
2,No improvement for bearers of ligh accent,"I have read the book, listened to the CDs and did the exercises, no improvement what so ever.which ever changes in my accent I have acquired are e defined by a professional(after this feutal attempt I have turned to professional help ) as incorrect pronunciation (low level english, ""non western"")."
4,Good Practice guide,It takes a lot of practice to learn the accent however I am still in process and practicing and hopefully some day I wii achieve my perfect American English Accent.
3,American Accent Training,"A DVD with video would be better.I speak English with a accent,but English being my native Language, I did not need most of the stuff ..It is not a bad way to learn American accent but the book ,colored pencil ,was a bit of a throw back to 20 years ago.Video tutorials are better."
4,Sheer Remastered Attack,"Another one that a good going over was bound to happen, listened to it early this morning and it does sound very very good. I don't believe this one had the same problems the first two did with the muggy sound but it appears this one was tweaked somewhat from the last remaster. So again, I recommend it especially if you don't have this one, if you have it, maybe the bonus tracks might be of interest, anyway, I collect Queen so I got it for my own interests. Next review, A Night At The Opera, which I'm listening to now.Visit my site sometime and say ""Hi"" @ Judemac Forever."
3,Think I'll stay around around around,"Queen's third album featured their first American hit, ""Killer Queen"". It also features some other songs that have come to be regarded as Queen classics, notably ""Now I'm Here"" and ""Stone Cold Crazy"". But there are a few songs here that I don't care for all that much, most notably the two versions of ""In the Lap of the Gods"". I'm not saying they are bad, just that they're not really my cup of tea. However, most Queen fans love this album, and if you like Queen you may agree with that opinion."
5,Another solid rocker!!!,My new purple shoes have been amazing the people next door. And my Rock & Roll 45s' been enraging the folks on the lower floor.Why do you not have this album? Sell your Duran Duran collection and get this NOW!!!
5,Sheer Guitar Attack,"Worth it alone for May's Brighton Rock guitar sound. Also the breakthru with Killer Queen. Other highlights include, in the lap of the gods revisited and fan favorite Now I'm Here."
5,Kings of the Medley,"Whereas many people think that the best thing about the Beatles' Abbey Road is the medleys on the second side, I regard Queen as the medley King. For the Queen album in question, a medley extends through songs three (""Tenement Funster""), four (""Flick of the Wrist""), and five (""Lily of the Valley"") for a total of 8 minutes and 17 seconds. The medley starts to ring in my head as soon as I think of it: heavy power cords, dramatic changes in tone from soft to heavy, from serious to flamboyant. The medley is followed by ""Now I'm Here,"" which has more fun dramatic changes. I once heard Queen referred to as a heavy metal band, and track 8 (""Stone Cold Crazy"") could attest to that. Most people, however, would probably argue against such a label; but man, does Queen love its head-banging moments!"
3,Decent for the price,"I bought this as a back-up to keep in my toolbox. While certainly not the highest quality tool I've come across, it performs well for the price. The wire gauge guide seems accurate enough, and the snips make a clean cut. Nice for a spare or for low usage."
5,"Worth buying-just for ""Soon""","I was just leaving Atlanta, driving back to Birmingham when I heard this hyper-electro jazz/funk tune ""Soon"" on WRAS 88.5. It blew my mind. Not since Talking Heads ""Born Under Punches"", and probably Billy Cobham's ""Stratus"", has a tune clearly lifted the face of funk for its particular time. These songs were jaw-drop striking-from the moment I first heard them. ""Soon"" had the same effect on me. Duplaix knows what he's doing. I would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates Weather Report, Kraftwerk, Jan Hammer, Talking Heads, Steely Dan, Spacek. Jazzanova ""In Between"" sounds like the sum/synergy of all the afore-mentioned musicians. Funk, jazz, hip-hop cutting edge. This is the funk that I hoped the future would bring.This is the music of optimism: nu funk for a nu world. This is the funk NdegeOcello calls funky. Peace, Duplaix...Vikter Duplaix."
4,Jazza-Luva,"I really like this cd, although I will agree with some of the reviews about the Ursula Rucker psuedo-rap that really didn't need to be included. It starts out with quiet sampling and turns into an explosive of lush and exotic riffs. One of the outstanding pieces of jazz on here is #5 Hanazono, followed by Mwela,Mwela (Here I Am) featuring one of the strongest vocalists around Valerie Etienne. I love the 'off key' vocal stylings of #12 Dance the Dance, and unlike another reviewer, I really got into 'Takes You Back'. I believe it was made not to be 'perfect', just a little off kilter. Well, that's it for me. I love this cd and I have made it a gift to several friends. If you love Jazzanova, this is a buy!"
5,Jazzanova - In Between,"This is how it's done. From the very first track of IN BETWEEN, you know you're in for some quality listening. ""L.O.V.E. And You & I"" is a piece of cut-up jazz that's only enhanced by the stop-start instrumentation. If you want something smoother, ""No Use"" will be like silk against your ears. ""Hanazono"" takes us into a detour of Japan, but ""Mwela, Mwela (Here I Am)"" lands us safely in Africa with its rhythms and chorus. Even an interlude like ""Cyclic"" is packed full of emotion -- it leads into the thoughtful and delicate ""Another New Day."" ""Soon,"" ""Glow and Glare,"" and ""Takes You Back,"" are electro throwbacks of the best kind. There's no one quite like Jazzanova, and this album proves why."
2,This album blows... mostly.,"Despite excellent editorial reviews on both allmusic.com and here on amazon, i have to say I think this album is a bit trite and ... well... opportunistic. With the recent success of Koop, Lamb, and various other techno-turned-electronica-turned-jazz artists lately... my first venture into the music of Jazzanova was a huge disappointment. Oh, and the weak attempts at rapping make an uninspiring album simply bad. I can't believe someone didn't tell them... ""hey, you guys aren't rappers... so, please stop. STOP!"""
2,"Good on formatting, fair on operations","I bought this book mostly because I wanted to learn Excel quickly. The book covers formatting extensively but there is very little on how to make your spreadsheet work, on how to actually get the program to make calculations. I wanted to do crosstablulatons, which is handled differently than in earlier versions of Excel. The term wasn't even mentioned in the book. Now they use pivot tables, which were not described adequately. There are few books out there about the new version. This one was frustrating."
2,More pictures than information,"Not much information in this one. I read the whole thing in just a few hours, and I read slowly. Not what I expected at all. Did not cover digital photography much at all. Of course, digital was new when the book came out, but now books like this are bound (no pun intended) to go the way of the 35MM cartridge."
4,Review from a 40 year old pale male whale,"The 40+ pale-male-whale demographic is not your primary target, so my opinions on individual songs are what works for me and what doesn't.I tend to like the ballad-type stuff, but the faster ""I Know What You Thinkin"" is a great opening song. I tend to shy away from rap stuff, so the next two songs didn't do much for me.""Hello My Love"" just blew me away -- great song, fantastic ballad. Pinay all have great voices, and this track showcases them so well.If you like gospel, you'll enjoy ""I'mma Be Just Fine"" and ""Unconditionally."" If you were alive in the 80s, you might like the Jets cover too!"
4,I'm lovin It,"Pinay is FINALLY back! This album is a lot more focused than their first effort, with more of an emphasis on dance/r&b, than Inevitable's 'all-over-the-place' feeling. I've got tracks 1-3 playing over and over in my car stereo, looking like a fool, grooving in my car seat during rush hour. Of course, the ballads are strong as well, but that was expected with these girls' heavenly voices. However, its the faster songs like ""I Know What You Thinkin"", ""What Now"", and ""I Came To Party"" that surprised me. I hope their record label can get them some radio and club play because these songs deserve to be out there. If you're looking for a CD to party to, this is it.!"
5,outstanding,"jus from listening to the opening song on this cd,i knew already that this was a keeper.beats and lyrics go together in this well put together compilation."
2,it's NOT Sergio Leone,"I ordered this with the hope of re-living the atmospheric and operatic triumpsh of Leone (Eastwood Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West).Honestly, I'm not a true critic, but I was nevertheless let down with the movie. Knowing Klaus Kinsky and Gian Maria Volonté were starring in the movie made want to buy it. But alas, the Volonte' character of Indio we came to admire for his acting skills and on stage persona, was NOT the same here. Primarily due to the dubbing. In For a Few Dollars more and Fist Full of Dollars, we heard the dubbed voice reflected a resonance and depth that is not represented in this film - a different dubbing voice was given... it almost made me laugh.Buy this if you want, but I was sadly let down.Bottom line, not in the best Leone spirit and poor dubbing.save your money and put it towards ""The Great Silence""... it's not Leone but has Morricone for the soundtrack, which is wonderful."
5,Zip Ties,I bought these zip ties because I needed to secure lattice on my balcony railing. I wanted to block the wind and sun on the one side and also still allow air to flow through. I ordered this specific kind because of the size and the strength of them (plus I read the reviews) and I liked the price and how many were in the bag. They have worked out perfectly and gave me the length I needed and are very sturdy. And now I have plenty extra for anything else that comes along and needs a zip tie. Thank you!
4,Just about what you'd expect,These are the heavy duty version. That means extra heft and a bit stiffer than your smaller ties. These aren't for delicate bundling but they'll shine where you need the strength.
5,Great Natural Cable ties,"Excellent , I would buy again. I reecommend to all. A good valeThese cable ties are very usefull for many conventional problems each day."
1,Not Strong,I would not recommend getting these. I used them to secure a wind screen to my balcony. They constantly snap and i have to keep attaching new ones. I came home two nights ago will all but one part of the shield secure. I will not purchase these again. I ran out of ones I got from home depot and thought these would be a fine substitution. Switching back to that brand.
5,A manuel for intermediate-advanced users,"The strength of this book is in the customization, such as creating your own Picture Tubes. It's extremely hard to find Paint Shop Pro books that don't focus exclusively on enhancing and cleaning up digital photos. This is one of the very few. However, this is not at all a book for anyone new to Paint Shop Pro. It assumes a strong knowledge of concepts and basic functions, for that you may want to her ""Paint Shop Pro Solutions"" book. Neither book has much - if any - color in it, which is unfortunate, but the instructions are clear and concise."
2,Paint Shop Pro 8 Power ... Not,"This book really needs a Glossary. The author assumes too much -- including that the reader has PSP 8's Manual (one does not if the program is bought online and downloaded). One cannot start a project in this book if you do not know where to begin. I have been using PSP 7 for two years and recently got PSP 8, and this book has given me very little help. Look for something that at least has a solid overview or foundation (it does not have to be intro to)."
4,Paint Shop Pro Power,"Not having read it all, I consider this book well informed and a very well presented material for those who wish to explore the program further."
4,And we are off to yet another planet.,"I'm going to skip the plot synopsis, because you can read it elsewhere. What I will say is that by the third book in this series the format seems to get a bit repeatative. Sparta, a.k.a. Ellen Troy, works for the Board of Space Control and is sent to yet another planet/satellite to solve yet another crime that, while on the surface may seem unrelated, are actually connected by a secret group of people who are also connected to her biological enhancements. She's been to Venus and the Moon and now she visits Mars. I'm beginning to think Preuss is simply attempting a tour of the solar system.Preuss' writing still seems to hold up throughout the book and I was still eager to find out how this one wrapped up. However, the overall mystery of the series is being drawn out a little too much. I think this could have been wrapped up nicely in three rather than six books."
3,Good value - Esp for Isaac Stern Lovers,"Almost half of this CD contains tracks by Isaac Stern with the Columbia Orchestra or Philadelphia / Ormandy. For Stern fans, or for those just now finding Romantic era violin music appealing (i.e., easy listening), the collection has some the best known along with some light ones (think Kreisler). The Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saens and Lalo pieces come to mind as essential for first-time listeners. The audio quality varies somewhat, but the performances are more than adequate, especially at this price point."
3,NOT her best!,"If you want to check out Mariah's best works in terms of creativity check out ""Butterfly"" and ""Glitter [Soundtrack]"" The singles from ""Daydream"" (All number one hits) were great, and she's never sounded better... but the filler material here leaves more to be desired. Highlighys include the Jermaine Dupri-produced #1 ""Always Be My Baby"" and the Puff Daddy produced hit ""Fantasy""...a classic. The remix is just as good if not better then the original. The sampling on it works wonders and is superior to the original. ""When I Saw You"" is lacking lyrically, and the later reworking of it 'Whenever You Call"" from ""Butterfly"" is much better. ""Forever"" has a nice retro feel to it and is also a highlight. ""I Am Free"" is also a great Gospel-like song but ""My Saving Grace"" from her latest offering ""Charmbracelet"" is similar and better. So overall if you want to get this Mariah album go ahead... but don't be expecting her bst material. Buy ""Butterfly"" and ""Glitter"" for that."
2,I thought I had reviewed this one!,"Amazon.com keeps reminding me that I haven't given my take on this particular Carey album. I actually thought that I had done all that are in my collection.Well, ""Daydream"" is no better or worse than the one that preceded it or the one that followed.It just goes to support my belief that if you have one or two by the singer, you have them all."
1,YAWWWWNNNNNN!!!,What a boring album. It is a good album to put your kids/little brothers/little sisters to sleep!
1,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"the reason it's called daydream is because nobody can stay awake while listening to her. she has no talent but since people like her face when she has 20 pounds of make-up on, her videos make money."
5,GREAT!,Well I gave it five stars because it is by Mariah Carey and she is like my favorite recording artist ever! The cd is wonderful I have had it since it first came out and has always been on of my favorite cd's.
3,"Gloomy Cover, Dark Mood","I'll grant it to you guys: this album was recorded while Mariah was going through a difficult time, her relationship with Tommy Mottola breaking down and everything.But this album...man! You can't be that dark-mooded.I really like some tracks: UNDERNEATH THE STARS and WHEN I SAW YOU.The duet with Boyz II Men is heaven-sent and ALWAYS BE MY BABY is the one track that delivers some uptempo joy.MELT AWAY is the finest track off the whole album.The rest is simply fillers...Mariah get back to uptempos!..."
4,"Good, but the last song was the best.","I usually don't like Mariah Carey's music. To me, it all seems to be the same girl/boy lovey-dovey sickening stuff. ""Daydream"" was no different. However, her vocals are wonderful and this easily makes up for her sometimes unimaginative lyrics. The re-make of Journey's ""Open Arms"" was great. However, what really got to me was the last song on the disc, Looking In. It TOTALLY abandoned Mariah's usual lyrics. It's amazingly true-to-life and heartfelt. It has a bittersweet tone to it that really echoes reality. As a teenager, I could identify with what she writing about and I believe this song to be the MOST accurate thing to real life then I've ever seen or heard. I commend you Mariah. Even if you don't like her music, this one song made up the difference for me."
5,AWESOME ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ALL the songs on this album are AWESOME,I love them ALL!!! My favorite songs on this album are~ Fantasy,Underneath The Stars,One Sweet Day,Always Be My Baby,Melt Away,Forever!!! It's inspiring and uplifting, BUY IT & LISTEN TO IT!!! If I could give this album 10 stars I would!!! ***LOVE YA MARIAH!!!*** ***A MARIAH FAN 4 LIFE!!!***"
4,great great songs,"Stuck-up Mariah released a truly great CD here.There are some fantastic songs that never made radio,like Forever and especially When I Saw You.When not screaming Mariah has a beautiful,slightly husky voice.This shows in Underneath the Stars,When I saw you and the beautiful Open Arms. Actually I would recommend this Cd as it is so nice and I now feel like hearing it."
5,one of mariah's best records,"this album was a huge success in 1995 and 1996 Mariah was everywhere on people's CD's players, radio and all over the charts. She also broke records with this album. It's full of beautiful melodic ballads and r&b numbers you can jam to. I rank this record up there with her Butterfly album, I think people of any genre can enjoy both this and the Butterfly album though it's primarily r&b/soft pop with a hint of hip hop/soul"
3,The last supper for Mariah Carey,"I bought ""Mariah Carey"", I bought ""Emotions"".. I stopped at ""Daydream""... as apart the old school fan of Mariah Carey- listening to her all the way back when I was Elementary school.. after this album, I feel as if she's ignored her older listeners to try and reap profits out of the younger crowd that's around. If her videos and fashion choices are any indication, her musical quality has degraded as well to sell with mainstream and producers. In this record, she's making the cross over from her usual ballads and infuses more R&B to entice more R&B listeners. I also think she's trying to show off her raunchier side to her ex-husband, but that's just my opinion. If you choose to buy any other CD's after this, be my guest, but I'd say you'd be getting the best of the last of her quality in this CD."
3,eh--whatever,"This Cd is a pushover. She's probably being pushed over by her better works like Butterfly and Music Box, but that's beside the point. Despite the fact that Daydream spawned Mariah's greatest singles--One Sweet Day, Fantasy and Always Be My Baby, the rest of the album can't live up. The songs are incredibly soft for some reason and aren't that great. Underneath The Stars is alright, but is very cliched. I think it is still worth getting, but not as much so as some of her other works."
2,Okay...?,"I was in a huge Mariah Carey phase a few years ago, so someone bought me this album. I must say though that the only good song on this CD is ""Forever."" I love the '50's vibe it gives off. I'm not a huge fan of her voice (I lose patience waiting for her to just find a note and stick with it), but she's capable of writing some good stuff. I don't know why she didn't this time. One star for ""Forever,"" one star for songwriting potential"
2,TOO MUCH STYLIN',"I agree that Mariah Carey has a spectacular voice, but like so many self-styled soul singers since Whitney Houston started this particular craze, she consistently attempts to see just how many notes she can create out of what was undoubtedly written as just one note. Consequently, at least in my opinion, the tremendous quality and power of her voice is overshadowed by all her ""stylin'."" Whitney's style was much more contained and did not detract either from the music or her voice, but for some reason, everyone since has been trying to outdo her and, in their attempts, failing miserably. I say that if you're lucky enough to have the voice to begin with, rely on it and forget about stylin'."
3,Nice offering of her range and voice,"I like Mariah, who she is and voice...this album is nice with flowing vocals and magnificent range. Ballads are ok and look for more upbeat dance tunes."
1,Please! For the love of Dear God no more!!!!!!,"Quite honestly this CD makes me want to yak. If entertainment value is measured in if you can sing only in tones a dog can hear THIS IS FOR YOU! If it is not, please don't waste your time."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM!,"THE worst album of the year, Ms. Carey has hit an all-time low. Not only are her songs mindless, dumb, and pathetic; but we need to listen to her God-awful voice that's ten times annoying as her perky attitude. The opener, 'Fantasy' has a terrible beat, 'Always Be My Baby' bugs you to the point of stomach sickness, and 'One Sweet Day' is nothing but a stupid attempt to cry our eyes out, but fails miserably (artistic? I'll believe that when she can spell it). Mariah needs get her act together. She can't rely on her looks and wholesomeness forever. This latest release (or, more appropriately, threat) is the definite definition of ""bimbo-ness"". END"
1,Yuck,It is repulisve to try to listen to Mariah Carey. The background noise (music) is very annoying and takes away from the entire song.
1,A dream within a dream. What's this a labrynth of dreams?,"This album Dream was made back before Mariah Carrey decided to divulge to the world that she's actually a natural blond. A year or so later when I first laid eyes on that lustrous, soft, blond hair I had to a pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. I think this album foreshadows the phenomenon that a lot of fans like myself were going to be experiencing in the future. I took off four stars because she has black hair on this album so she's not keeping it real and everyone knows what a bad mix phoniness and R&B is."
3,Not her best work,"Mariah Carey is more talented than this. This Cd might have produced the wonderful megahits One Sweet Day, Fantasy and Always Be My Baby, but that is all it does. there are 9 other traks which are barely worth listening too. Open Arms wasn't a great song to begin with, and Underneath the stars is incredibly soft. The rest of the CD really has no life to it and there is no point in writing about them."
3,Okay but she can do better,"I was kinda dissapointed when I purchased Daydream, because most of the songs were kind of boring. The whole cd was kinda mixed up. You have Fantasy, which begins her hip hop debut, and then One Sweet Day, which is ok, Underneath the Stars reminds me of her Fourth of July song on her Butterfly album, but other than that, the rest of the songs sound WAY messed up. Forever sounds like 60's crap, Long Ago is so hip-hop it's horrendous, and Looking In is very depressing for the last song on the cd. The Interlude, however, I kinda liked and hated. It's starts out REALLY strange but then gets better and better, but the Butterfy Interlude on her next album is way much better."
5,One of her best,"This is a very good album from Mariah, in fact it is one of my favourites of hers. The 'duet' with Boyz 11 Men is wonderful, one of the best on the album. But unfortunately her later albums are not a touch on this or her earlier ones. It's too bad. But this is definately one album that will always be a pleasure to listen to."
2,Not worth the money,"I should have went online and used the Cliff Notes on there. I thought this book would have been better than the online information and have more details but I was disappointed when it came. It was just like the internet information so I was very disappointed,"
2,scary grandma,cd is great except for the super frightening song about the big bad wolf with sounds of people screeming in terror. cut this song and it would have 5 stars
3,Commonsense advice. Mighty thin volume.,"Brian Tracy has produced another great headline (Eat that Frog!) on which to hang 21 simple, straightforward pieces of advice, but as with his other books this motivational speaker has produced a very thin volume - just 117 pages. Brevity can be a good thing, sure, but at some point you wonder: ""where's the beef?"" I found myself nodding in agreement at the advice - there's nothing wrong with any of it - but next day I found it hard to remember much of what it said: a case of easy in/easy out. Tracy may be an excellent speaker, but as a writer he doesn't engage the brain sufficiently. There was nothing really new, provocative or profound here."
4,fighting the crunch,"This book is a sourcebook of encouragement and practical advice on how to deal with business problems that could and will spin out of control unless they are handled deliberately and decisively. Plain good advice, though not necessarily easy to implement. A good read, beneficial to all and not limited to just business concerns but has principles that apply to all of life."
5,Go Auntie!!,"Man, my aunt knocked me out with her first book. I truly enjoyed it. It touched on a very big part of African American life/issues - the color complex. I recommend this book to everyone!"
3,It was great!,"I really enjoyed the book. I laughed and cried. Some of the characters I knew personally. It gave you something to think about in terms of race issues within the African-American culture.The characters could have been more descriptive They seemed one-dimensional. I found myself tryng to see their faces and physiques but there was nothing to guide me.With all that, I bought 3 books and gave them to friends. L. Harris is going to be a great writer."
5,Can a voice be unbearably beautiful?,"In the case of this singer, and this CD, very near.I was introduced to Natasha St-Pier somewhere over the Atlantic aboard an Air France flight inbound to Paris. Long before leaving the plane, I knew this album would be my most cherished French souvenir...and it is.She has youthful beauty. Her songs bespeak a certain self-effacing innocence. But oh Lord, that voice. Silken, burnished, flawless. Don't speak French? It doesn't matter; neither do I. The sheer beauty of this voice is reason enough to buy and enjoy this disc. And after you've heard this album, you may find yourself, as I did, looking for French classes.g."
4,French love,"I met Natasha's music when driving from Geneve to Paris with one of my dearest friends. She introduced me to this amazing French diva. I felt in love inmediately with her voice. Natasha's songs can be heard for hours without tiring up. The songs were well chosen, providing the CD of a right balance. I bough it at Virgin's at Champs d'Elisee just right arriving Paris and I could not stop listening to it for the next four or five weeks. My second time in Europe coincided with the second release and didn't hesitate to buy it. De L'Amour Le Mieux is much better though. I also recommend another great French female singer, Nolwenn Leroy."
4,Great nipple for newborn but BPA in bottle,"My newborn is doing well with the slow-flow nipple but I wanted to switch to a BPA-free bottle. So, I bought the Born-Free 9-oz glass bottle instead, but discovered that the Born-Free nipple did not suite my baby. He would swallow too much at a time and spit up lots of milk. I ended up switching the nipple with the NUK nipple (it may not look like it would fit, but it does!) and now it's a perfect combination."
5,Thank You,I recieved the item promptly and efficiently. The item was as advertised. There were little issues with certain parts (the hole in the nipple for ventalation wasn't peirced all the way and some of the little caps make the lid leak) but those are manufacture errors and not the seller. So all is as it should have been. THANK YOU!
2,Cute But Leaky!,"Alrighty, so I bought these bottles for my son when he was 6 months old. I personally didn't like these bottles. The nipples always seemed too large and hard for him to grip in his mouth. I went through several shirts and bibs while using these. I used the bottles for a week and found that I simply couldnt take it anymore. I had to dump the bottles in the trash can and move on. I was really disappointed with the price and the product quality. Maybe just my luck?! Best wishes to all that buy these adorable bottles!"
1,not recommaded,"bought this because it got nice review. however, i'm disappointed by its so-called ""air-system"". I have to pull it out many times during feeding to let the air in. that makes baby cries... really frustrated..."
4,the music for Marvin and Tige,"I haven't seen the movie, but in answer to a viewer's question as to the music in the movie, it is Earl Klugh. He has quite a large collection of albums, and is a fantastice guitarist."
4,Desperately Seeking Video,"By chance I happened to have recorded half of this movie at the end of a program I intended to tape. Of course the tape ran out before the movie, so I don't know how it ends. If anyone out there has a copy, I'd love to hear from you!"
4,insufferable sadness,"This film was shown to my 4th grade class in the gym the last day of school before winter break. I remember everybody was so excited about the Christmas holiday, GI Joe figures and all that. But I left feeling so insufferably depressed for John Cassavetes' character. He was a sad guy. He should have been doing those Colt 45 commercials and not Billy Dee."
1,why oh why don't you have a zero star rating?????,"I just loved the Dead Hollywood Mom's Society-it was fresh, funny and interesting. Imagine my excitement when I heard that there had been a follow up. The protagonist is an interesting mother and career woman. As a wife she really could use some help. Her husband Kit is a grade A jerk and I can't for the life of me figure out why they are married. Oh well maybe the next book will be better and she'll meet a decent man and the next dead celeb will be her cheating self indulging husband."
4,English Folk meets Country Rock,"I would say this is the best of the Trevor Lucas/ Jerry Donahue albums with FC. Their 3 studio albums with Fairport brought more of an American country-rock feel to the band, between Trevor's Australian voice and Jerry's lead guitar. I'm more a fan of the British sound, but I have to say - Trevor has a fantastic Baritone voice, and Jerry plays some fine lead guitar. This album actually has more of a traditional folk feel than the other mid 70's Fairport - and Jerry's instrumental blowout on the guitar should please the fans of Richard Thompson's Irish reels from previous albums. For those who aren't familiar with the band's overall career - Fairport Convention's claim to fame was combining British traditional music with rock (best exemplified by albums like ""Liege & Lief"" and ""The Bonny Bunch of Roses""), so this album isn't a fully representative starting point, but it's not a bad one for fans of folk or country rock."
5,A Fairport treasure,"Perhaps because it doesn't contain any of the founding members (or even members from the first three albums) this Fairport album tends to be underrated. Even I've made that mistake in the past. It's strong both instrumentally and vocally, with Trevor Lucas' deep voice, Jerry Donahue's masterful country-flavored guitar, and fiddler Dave Swarbrick at his dazzling best. Not to mention the ace rhythm section of Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks. The songs are a good mix of originals and trad-arr. A Fairport treasure whose stature has only grown with the passage of time."
2,One great song and not much else,"This album contains a fantastic arrangement of the traditional song ""Polly on the Shore"", about a man pressed into service aboard a pirate ship. Other than that, this is a pretty tedious album. There are at least four songs that, no matter how many times I play the album, I can't remember anything about them a day later. The rest are uninspired and sound like outtakes from ""Angel Delight"". I would give this album one star, except that I've heard ""Gottle o' Geer"". ""Nine"" isn't aggressively bad like ""Gottle"", it's just bland.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
2,Quality is not as good as it used to be,"I purchased one of these toys for my Lab about three years ago and he still plays with it all the time. The quality was excellent and it still looks the same as when I took it out of the package. However, I recently purchased another one for my Dad's dog and the quality is just not the same. The older one I got for my dog, is more rigid. I gave the new one to my Dad's dog yesterday and after playing with it for a short time, the side was already caved in. I was able to push it back out but the quality is just not the same. The material it's made of is much softer and I really don't think this one is going to last because it will be much easier to tear. I'm very disappointed in the lesser quality of the new ball."
1,Strong smell--wonder about the chemical components,"Opened the package to a very strong smell. Packaging also says to keep toy away from children--hmmm...wonder what's in it to make it soft? I will probably use this on a very limited basis. I washed it before I thought it all through, so can't return it."
3,treats fall out,I like the soft rubber. You really have to use large treats otherwise they fall out way too easily. I use medium size dog bones and the toy keeps my dog engaged for about 40 minutes.
1,Not for heavy chewers!,"This may be alright for a dog that does not like to chew, but our Olde English Bulldogge made short work of it. In about 20 min she had chewed THROUGH the ball to get to the treats. You also need to STUFF it FULL with treats or they will not come out no matter what you do. Obviously, she got so frustrated it was easier to make her own exit for the treats! Also, it has a really strong plastic-chemical smell for anyone who is chemically sensitive. Hope you have better luck than we did! :)"
4,It's an Orange Ball,"This Orange Ball is wonderful - if you are looking for a way to get your dog to eat slower, this or the Kong Wobbler is the way to go. The wobler is far more durable though, this is a soft plastic. If your dog chews up stuff, you can't leave this with them. The wobbler would take a hammer to damage. Both make excellent toys though - we have both. The wobbler for the dog that destroys things, and the OB for the one that doesn't!"
4,Decent but there's better,This toy is decent but not as good as the 'Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball Dog Toy'. This toy is rubber which is quieter than the plastic ones but the hole is not adjustable so you'll need to find the perfect sized treat. I prefer the adjustable hole to accommodate different sized treats and adjust the difficulty level.
1,Satisfaction NOT Ensured!,"BEWARE of these balls! They REEK of a chemical/plastic smell. I've emailed the manufacture through their website inquiring about the balls safety and the fact that it's a very STRONG chemical smell that lingers on my hands, and dog's mouth LONG after he's done playing with it. This, combined with the fact that it's MADE IN CHINA and God only knows what type of ingredients and chemicals are used.I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THE COMPANY AFTER MAKING THREE (3) EMAILS TO THEM!!!! Great customer service eh?My email was simple, is it safe? Non toxic? Why the smell? and MORE IMPORTANTLY, would they let their infants/babies put it in THEIR mouth?It smells so strong, I put it in a bag (while awaiting my response that NEVER CAME from the company) and it started to smell up the entir cellar way!!!'BUYERS BEWARE!"
2,Great while it latsted,"My 1.5 year old AmStaff Terrier/Pit mix torn this ball apart in 3 play sessions. It only lasted this long because I was able to pry it off his mouth the first 2 times. While it lasted he loved it, much more than the buster cube which was noisy and hard to get treats out. However, for the price, I might as well get bully sticks which will last longer."
1,"Easily cracked, don't buy if your dog likes to chew!","My dogs really love food dispensing toys and I had high hopes for the Tricky Treat Ball after reading other reviews. Although my shepherd mix seemed to really like it at first, he quickly got frustrated when the food stopped coming out (it is really difficult to get food out of the middle chamber once it is fairly empty) and he resorted to chewing. Before I could take the ball away, he had cracked it in several places. This toy is not at ALL durable if your dog likes to chew. I'm really disappointed. Will stick with theEverlasting Fun Ball LargeandStarMark Bob-A-Lot Interactive Pet Toy, as they seem to be much more durable."
1,was disappointed,"due to the nature of the opening where you drop in the snacks, there is a well created within the ball (i had to feel around the inside of the ball because my dog was getting frustrated from not being able to get the treats out and he is a smart dog). the treats sit in the well and wouldn't fall out of the ball when you move it around as the toy description says. i shook it all over the place and still couldn't get all of the treats out. won't recommend this product."
1,Omega Paw Ball Destroyed,"My 12 lb poodle mix destroyed this ball in less than an hour. The concept is what I have been hoping for.However, no company seems to be willing to make it out of better material. It just needs to be madewith a better plastic/rubber material. It does keep your dog very busy, but then it gets ripped apart tooquickly."
3,Great idea - not for dogs who like to chew,"I got this as a replacement for a different atomic bomb toy that I had got for my Siberian Husky. He literally chewed through the hole the food comes out of in less than 5 minutes. This IS NOT a durable item. If you have a dog that likes to play more than he/she likes to chew, then this could be a great toy that would be fun for the dog. I would not recommend this for huskies, labs, golden retrievers etc."
3,Great idea...but the excitement wears off quickly.,"Could just be my Shihtzu, but after a few days of play, she is off to other toys. I think if you kept treats in it all the time it would be better...but, I don't want her to be obese."
3,not very hardy,"my dog chewed a big hole in it within 1 hr of putting a treat into it. She's 9months old, and only 35 lbs."
5,Best dog toy ever!,"After seeing my mother's Schnauzer use one of these for quite some time, I finally got around to getting one for my dogs. I have a 50lb Walker Hound and a 70lb Basset Hound and this is large enough for them. The Basset doesn't get it but he manages to follow the other one around and pick up the missed morsels. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an item that will stimulate their dog."
3,"Good product, always supervise becasue it won't hold up to chewing","My Jack Russell requires a lot of stimulation through-out the day. This meal-time toy is a great substitute for regular bowl feedings, and is an additional way to keep Skeeter happy and active.One of the features I like is that as the food level becomes lower, the food comes out less frequently and is more challenging! This is a double-edged sword because my pup will become frustrated after a certain point and start chewing to get to the remaining kibble!My advice is this: When you hear that it's no longer rolling around, go and retrieve it. It will last a lot longer that way!"
3,Good product but easy for strong chewers to destroy,"My greyhound has had this item for about 30 mins and has already tried to eat through the plastic to get to the treats that are not easily coming out. He is having a hard time with the ""rolling"" concept now that there are fewer treats and they are harder to get out, so he has resorted to chewing to try to open the hole wider. I am home with him now as I wanted to see how he would do with this toy, but I was hoping to use it when I was at work so he could have some time to occupy himself after his mid day walk. Knowing he is a strong chewer as well as a hound that will not give up on a treat, I am worried that this toy will be destroyed by him in short order. I like the concept as it has taken him some time to figure it out and certainly can provide some mental stimulation, but I wish the material of the toy itself was stronger (more like a kong which my dog loves but can now empty in a very short time)."
2,Good Idea - Not Very Durable,"This is a great concept. The ball looks fun, the dents in it make it easy for a dog to pick up and toss around. However, it is not made to withstand even moderate chewing. The second my dog got a hold of it she decided that rolling it around to get the treats out was for chumps. Within 2 minutes she had chewed through the sides and got them out her way. So the ball goes into the trash along with all the little pieces that she chewed off of it. She normally isn't a terrible chewer, but this ball really didn't stand up too well against her."
3,It is more difficult than it looks,At first I thought it looked too simple and it was not going to be more difficult for my chihuahua to figure out than her kong. But then she started playing with it and it's actually a lot harder than it looks. The inside really does keep the treats in there for a long time and she sometimes even walks away because it's taking so long. Great toy to really make your dog think!
3,Supervise while playing!,"My year and a half German Shepherd and four year old Siberian Husky both really enjoyed playing with this toy. The only problem was it is not very durable, and if your dog likes to chew, then this toy cannot withstand strong teeth. Our German Shepherd was alone for five minutes and chewed a hole through the top. Again, both dogs like playing and chasing the toy, but we should have monitored her playtime with it better."
3,"Great toy, but......","Great toy, simple design, effective at engaging the dog. He even played with it without food (unlike his Kongs). However, the material is very soft and the dog bit through it on his first use of it. Darn it! I would love the same toy made with tougher rubber/plastic."
5,Great toy for the price!,Our dog loves it. Easy to fill with any small treat or food. Rolls nicely and dispenses food appropriately. Great buy!
5,Keeps dog from inhaling food,"I bought this for my son to use with his dog who eats so quickly, the food goes in whole barely chewed. Putting the dog's meals into the ball forces him to slow down between bites, and he doesn't seem to mind at all. Bloating is gone, and the dog enjoys the game."
5,My dog LOVES this toy,She loves this toy and has to play with it after morning and evening meals.We put part of her food in the bowl and the rest in the toy and she has more fun rolling it around.
2,Hole chewed in it first day,This tricky treat ball is made of very soft plastic and the 60 lb dog ripped a chuck off of it the first day. Maybe it would be good for a smaller dog.
3,Not great for my dogs,"I can definitely see how this would be a good toy. Unfortunately my dogs enjoy chewing and subsequently destroying everything they perceive as ""theirs"". Some things can stand up to their abuse (nylabones, tennis balls, kongs, etc) but this definitely wasn't one of them."
2,Not quite strong enough,"Loved the idea, but the ball material was too soft and pliable and my lab mix ripped the ball apart in half a day. One day I will probably buy her another one but not put treats inside because she loved the ball itself."
2,Dog not interested. Not functional,The ball is not designed correctly. The treats do get stuck up there really well...so well in fact I had difficulty trying to get them out. After my dog gave up I wanted to get the treats out so they wouldn't be stale. It took me forever to shake out the kibble. It would be better if the ball screwed and unscrewed together.
1,Not for strong chewers,"This ball is made of soft material. From the picture, it looks like a harder, more durable material. My dog had chewed this to bits in no time."
5,pretty good for the price,"I got this for my black lab puppy and she loves it, when she sees me with it she gets all excited to play with it. I got the large one, its kinda annoying to put food in cause you have to shake it alot to get the food to go down, sometimes the food doesn't come out very easily, mainly when theres only a little food in there. My puppy at first tried to chew it and realized she couldn't, so she doesn't try to chew it.I'd recommend this to anyone that has a playful dog/puppy"
1,Dog chewed up in few minutes,This toy seemed great at first until my weimeraner got upset that the treats would not come out and ripped a large chunk out of the opening within the first 10 minutes.
1,Not Worth It,"This treat ball is NOT worth buying.I'm interested in every treat toy I can find because I use them to feed my dog. I don't use a bowl to feed him, instead I divide his meals between a few treat toys so he can ""hunt"", use up some of his excess energy, & help to slow him down while eating so he doesn't eat too fast. He LOVES his treat toys!I thought this would be a great treat toy BUT once the kibble was in it was near impossible to get out, especially if it was only partially filled. I even had trouble getting it out & my dog found it near impossible although he tried & tried. This is because there is a rim around the inside of the treat hole that traps kibble rather than letting it bounce around & fall out as my dog rolled it around. He could have, & did, roll it around for an hour trying to get food out w/o much success.Save your money on this & purchase something better for your pup."
1,Chocolate Lab Destroyed in under 5 minutes,"I really had high hopes for this one.My dog had a hole chewed in this in literally 5 minutes...disappointing..If your dog doesn't destroy things quickly, it'll probably be a great toyfor them..."
1,Gone in 60 seconds,"I have a chocolate lab and I got this for her when she was 6 months. It did not even last 24 hours. She had it in pieces and chewed through all the rubber and then I had to go around and find a whole bunch of little orange stuff everywhere. Fun toy, but not for agressive chewers."
2,No Challenge,The snacks fall out too easily as it is just an open hole but my dog enjoys pushing it around the room.Much prefer the cube.
3,Too Easy,"I think this may be great for a young dog, but my 3 year old American Pit Bull Terrier didn't enjoy it.I put some of her food and treats in it. She was confused about it. Eventually she got it, but stopped playing after 5 minutes. She hasn't played with it since. Might have been more successful if she was starving.She liked the Kongs better. She can spend hours on a kong."
3,not for strong chewers,My Chesapeake Bay Retriever tore a hole through this after 15 minutes. He's a strong chewer but his other treat balls did better than that. I'm sure it's fine for dogs that don't want to chew as much.
2,Not good for strong chewers,The dog loved this toy when I gave it to him to play with before Christmas. The dog however is a strong chewer and it only took 15 minutes before he decided to chew a hole to get the treats out instead of rolling it around on the floor. It was a pricy toy for one day use so I would suggest they put a rating on it for chewers.
5,Good,"Very fast shipping. My dog loves this toy, its the only toy shes had that she didn't eat or tear up in less than a week. very derable"
3,just ok - my 2 dogs are not the least bit interested in it,"Well, this was purchased to keep our two canine ""monkeys"" busy while we're out. Even after filling the toy with the YUMMIEST treats (dried chicken jerky) and showing both dogs what to do they gave up after only a few minutes... no go"
3,It is all right,It is an all right toy. It keeps my puppy busy for a while until he got frustrated trying to get something out. I put his food in the ball and I get frustrated trying to clean this out. Good toy but pain to clean.
3,Not for Chewers!,The ball is easy to fill with treats. It definitely kept my dog busy but it only lasted two days with my German Shepherd. He chewed out the middle of the ball and a big hole was left in the center so I was no longer able to use it after that. If you have a heavy chewer then I suggest supervising the dog when using this otherwise the toy will not last. I was not watching him play with it and by the time I noticed the chewing of the center it was too late.
2,No match for our Pitbull,"The toy was great at first for our pitbull. She couldn't figure it out for a while. Once I showed it to her, it seemed to be almost too easy. She had it down and emptied it of treats in a minute or two. Once empty, she was convinced there had to be more treats inside and proceeded to rip it open at the hole by giving it a few good chews and tugs. We were really happy with it at first since she seemed to like the toy and it kept her busy but it isn't durable enough for heavy chewers. I also think it dispenses treat a tad too easily."
