4,Easier Pet Bathing,The Rinse Ace Pet Shower has made bath time so much easier. The hose is long enough and the button on the sprayer enables me to get our dog's bath done quicker since I now don't have to shut the water off in between sudsing and rinsing! I have already recommended it to friends and family and will continue to do so!!
1,This book was awful.,"I'm completely baffled by the positive reviews of this book. Each chapter has many, many formulas/equations, but at most a dozen or so worked-out examples. I learn best by doing, and having the answers to the problems in the back just wasn't enough. I needed many more worked-out examples than this book provided--I needed to know WHY I was getting incorrect answers. I found this book to be extremely long-winded. I only wish I'd had an adequate substitute for my class. There were conceptual problems at the ends of the chapters to which the book failed to provide the answers."
3,Flan for Dummies,"Not bad! I used it to make a coconut flan and it was pretty nice. The texture was a bit too gooey, but it wasn't bad. The instructions on the box said to gradually add milk, bring to a boil stirring constantly, and refrigerate. I can do that, it's flan for dummies! Instead of milk, I used coconut milk to make a coconut flan. I made my own caramel sauce and sprinkled some shredded coconut on top of the chilled, caramel-coated flan. (see photo)Ingredients: Sugar, dextrose, calcium carragheen, salt, vanillin (an artificial flavor) and artificial color including FD & C yellow #5. Contains no eggs."
4,Great new release,"As we can expect from Bear Family this release is well documented and illustrated. Of course we are always missing some favorites, for me these are Oh, Babe and Mr. Sandman, to name two. The quality of the mastering is overall very good. Still there are some minuses. For instance, the track The Battle Of Kookamonga is not stereo as listed, it is in perfect stereo on BMG's American Dream - Best of the 50's Volume 2. Also the track No Hair Sam is in poor shape and can be heard in perfect three track condition on BMG Special Products Homer & Jethro 36 All-time Greatest Hits.Since my last review, BF has re-released the CD with the stereo version of The Batlle Of Kookamonga and a drop-out free No Hair Sam.The CD is subliem!"
4,My Days and Nights on the Battle-Field,"This book and the style of writing are both interesting, but the old style of writing may produce a bit of a slow read."
3,A bit different than what I excepted,"The only complaint I have is that 1 of my games was scratched when it arrived and that made that game unplayable. The first game, secrets can kill, has info stored on two different disks. So whenever you want to go to the high school you have to insert another disk.(which gets really annoying after a while.) Other than that, it sometimes takes it a little while to load things you click on. But overall, the pack was very fun."
5,Anyone Need Help?,"I would just like to say that I have completed all of the ND games, and if anybody needs help, just ask right here on your review! Thanks!:)"
4,CD's,"We already have these games, so this was a gift. It was kind of embarrassing because the kids wanted to play one CD (it comes with 5) and it was ONLY for Win 95, 98 and their computer used Win XP which the box stated the programs worked on! Kind of misleading, but luckily it was only game that didn't work with XP!"
3,Love the book,I received the book rather fast. I could not wait to get the book to start studying Gods word thoroughly.
3,Great guitarist but average DVD,"The production on this DVD is not that good. Steve Morse is better viewed on the following DVD's: Living Loud, Deep Purple Total Abandon, Sects Dregs and Rock n Roll. You will definitely want this in your collection if you're a Steve Morse fan like me but his other DVD's are alot better."
2,FOR GUITAR PLAYERS & FANS ONLY,That video is very good if you re a guitar plan or a fan of S.MORSE..otherwise the music is kind boring i would say..on the other hand his technique is VERY HIGH..very good guitar player indeed...
5,One Of The Best,"This is one of the greatest local / independent releases I've ever heard. I like stuff ranging from Cannibal Corpse to Mystikal and this is like perfect for me. Hip Hoppers would like ""Aim For My Head"" and metal heads would definately like ""Psycho"". The vocalist is one of my idols, the music is awesome, the guitars are impressive, The bassist is extremely talented and I wont even get started on the drummer. Throe, keep it up!!!!"
5,simply fantatsic!,"Justin Mcroberts is the most under appreciated artist i know of and i only came across one of his cds by chance! This album is beautiful. It is driven mainly in an acoustic style yet has sparks of electric shining through on several songs. Justin mcroberts has been truely gifted, his passion and soul burst through in every song on an album that does not appear to have been written just for the sake of making music but as a living testimony. The album (as the title suggests) searches such issues as trust, relationships, leadership, lonliness, friendship and even steps out eerily into touching on issues raised by pornography.Although Justin Mcroberts is a christian, and some of the lyrics reflect this strongly, i really do believe that non-christians will also love this album for so many reasons.The bottom line is that you should not just buy this cd, but you should buy all his other albums too. You won't regret it!"
2,I was somewhat dissapointed,"Um....a ""bad"" twin and a ""good"" twin, now where have I seen that story before?"
4,"Weis, Fun, Sci-Fi","During the summer Months when I'm not in school, I look forward to Entertainment reading something that's Sci- Fi and action packed; I feel that Margaret Weis has done this in her Dragonvarld Trilogy. She captivated me with Mistress of the Dragons and kept me with Dragon's Son, and left me wanting more similar reading with the last Master of the Dragons. (She is a real entertainment break from regular graduate school work, lol)"
3,How a Battleship can impact the enemy without actually firing a shot.,Nice overview of the history of this great battleship in the German Navy in WWII. Having been written in the 1950s by a British author it tends to be a bit biased. I did like the analysis of how the Tirpitz was able to negatively impact the course of the War of the North Atlantic by just being in existence.
3,A solid book but depends on the family age,"I'd say that this book is targeted for families with children over age 8. We're finding it not very suitable for my family with children ages 7, 5, and 2. There are five readings for Sundays in this book. But, for example, with a meditation that talks about Dan Rather, Waterloo, Micah, etc., I find myself having to explain practically every sentence to the children. The Monday through Saturday readings consist of Bible passages. But for example, the selection of Isaiah 19:19-25 leaves kids puzzled about how the highway between Egypt and Assyria relates to Christmas. Yes, this is very solid Biblical material, but we're not finding it age-appropriate for engaging a young family in the advent celebration despite the drawing on the book cover."
3,Big Lots great buy at $2 each,"I bought a kit and have been using it on two American Eskimo dogs and while it doesn't taste as good as malt flavor to the dogs probably (it's mint flavored) , it seems to be cleaning their teeth with continuous use every day or two. Only one problem so far was today where one dog starting coughing and finally spit up a huge foamy spit mass that when I picked it up looked like foamy tooth paste. So I'm a little worried since you don't rinse most dog teeth after you brush???? The other dog is fine."
4,WE DO NOT HAVE LOVE- WE ARE LOVE,"This is a thought provoking book that shares some great teachings. I enjoy and respect Byron Katie's booksThere are many great love books out their like Areal Forde's ""Soul Mates"" and my new favorite author Vaishali who shares that we do not have Divine Love, we are Divine Love. Love cannot be taken away from us. It is not earned. It IS!You Are What You Love"
2,"Loving What Is, not really","I found the book repetitious. The ideas behind the theory are valid, but the presentation was not good. We used this book ina club called Wisdom Seekers, and the group finally decided not to finish reading the book. Sorry, I'm usually not negative, but I make an exception in this case."
1,Condemnation with a CAPITAL C!,"I read this book shortly after being raped. I couldn't even get through the entire thing. The author may have caused her own pain, but there are some people out there who have suffered because of someone else's crime. Blaming a (genuine) victim is easy yet short-sighted and an obvious oversimplification. I honestly struggled with the ideas of self-blame that I got from this book until I read the one-star reviews. I'm thankful for the people who can get past this woman's hype and self-serving attitude of having arrived.Don't waste your money on a book that will sit on your shelf (and shoulders) weighing you down. If anything, I would recommend borrowing it from the library. If you must read it, skim it, and take her words with a grain of salt. Beware of her narcissism and need of approval from her audience.Additionally, the book is primarily based on her conferences/sessions with people, and is highly disorganized in its format."
3,Not too bad,"Well, in summery, I would say this book is not too bad, but not very good either. This book contains one key idea and it is repeatedly explained through examples. It gave me some good insights about how we think and how we react to the problems. But for me this is little shallow when it comes to detail."
2,boring,"This was a poor version of a self help book, written by a novicejust trying to make a buck at someone else's expense."
1,Just another Self-Help book,"I know everyone loves this book, but I was so bored with it. I think this book is about as basic as they come and, call me superficial, but I think Byron Katie is ""Loving What's On The Cover"". I'm not bitter against the woman, but putting yourself on the cover of a book with this title is asking for a joke or two. Anyway, about the book, I owned it, and I'm giving it to charity. I've read more than my fair share of self-help books, and this one, it's just NOT the one."
2,Psycho-babble,I'm glad I checked this one out @ the public library instead of paying good money for it. I gave it 2 stars for the authorsharing her experiences and what seems to have worked for her.
1,You have got to be kidding,"What was I thinking when I ordered this book. This is going to be a fast return. If I didn't have a job, and I didn't have a life, and if I had nothing better to do, I would read this book. Following the contemplative steps outlined in this book is great for the Zen crowd, but I just have to pass. If I needed this much in depth review of myself, I would seek professional help and perhaps medication. Applying these four simple questions and working them through in detail might be possible in considering the life of my cat, but for my continuing 45 years of human existence, I would rather not. Before you pay for this one, consider the work, and the depth of your life that you will be asked to examine. One thing comes to mind, ""move on""."
2,seems bloated in context,I was very glad I got her books from the local library. Her approach and way of speaking did not appeal to me though the info is helpful However I have been doing self-help books for 45 years so there was not a lot that was new to me in this. I would suggest getting the book from your library unless you have had a chance to look through it at your local bookstore.
3,Not for everyone.. some good ideas ..some bad,"Byron Kaytie had a revelation one day while she was in de-tox. She calls this revelation the Work. The basis for the work is 4 questions and then turning them around.I found most of these questions fine, and the turn around logical , but for people that have had severe trauma and abuse some of these things in the Work neggate what they have gone through.It is a ok so so .. book just take the advice as not the gospel."
1,Loving What Is,"The best recommendation I could give any one is to check this book out of the library rather than paying for it. The concept (and I mean singular) presented is so simple that you get it within the first 20 pages. Subsequent chapters offer transcript after transcript of various sessions between the author and different people with different problems to solve. It gets very tedious hearing these 4 questions (or variations on these questions or the additional bonus questions) asked over and over again. I'm not saying this book won't help some people change their attitudes about their lives, it's just not worth keeping in your private library. Some books you want to refer to over and over, this is not one of them. Read it and return it!"
2,"Save Your Money, Save Your Time & Save Your Sanity!","The only part of this book that I liked was the way she described the concept of: your business, other people's business and God's business-- helpful to think of things in this manner.I tried to change the star rating to 1, but it wouldn't budge! This is not even a 2 book.The book is basically cognitive therapy--challenge your thoughts/beliefs. Is it true? How do you know? etc.. There's some usefullness to that.The major problem I have with this book is where the author puts the responsibility of child abuse onto the victim! Of course, in Byron Katie's world, there are no victims, only co-conspirators. The common new-age theme of ""you create your reality"" runs through this book. If you're into that type of thinking, this is your book.Most of this book is plain rubbish, written by someone, IMO, who's climbed off the brink of sanity. Read it and laugh, but better yet don't read it at all!!"
2,I was not impressed.,"Someone recommended this book to me and after work I ran to the store to purchase and as soon as I was home, I made the time to begin the devour for relief.If you really want to get from point A to point B in a short amount of time, purchase the book ""Codependency, the Dance of the Wounded Spirits.It will enlighten you and make you realize you are where you are meant to be in this moment and time.I respect the authors journey and her prosperity for her endevours, but it is not for everyone.If it is meant to help you, it will. If you become frustrated with the detail, then find yourself a simpler way to deal with it.Recovery from any loss and aggravation is just changing the thought pattern and not looking for your journal so you can write and analyze.Life does not need to be documented. Just enjoy it!"
1,"To read this book, borrow a copy don't waste money buying it","I have heard all the ravings about this book. I knew I have wasted my money buying it before half way through it. Basically this book dresses up the prinicple of ""how your attitude affects your well being"" into something called ""the work"". I find it disturbing from the diaglogues that the author had with her subjects in that she obviously tried to steer them into answering what she deems is the answer that conforms to ""the work"". Whilst there are some helpful suggestions as to how to view a situation, I find the author generalized all feelings and emotions to the extent of invalidating them. I believe there are certain feelings or emotions which cannot, and should not, be ""turnaround"" as propounded by the author. Overall it is just another self help book which I should never have bought."
3,Incomplete,This book does contain some useful strategies for peace but is borderline denial of what is and totally squashes any hope for anything 'good' to come into your life. The book is incomplete in and of itself. There are spiratic tid bits of real teachings mixed in with a lot of dialogues between the author and her audience participants (this accounts for 95% of the book).If you feel drawn to this book make sure you have a good spiritual teaching to help you see the why of Katie's 'technique' and to not get drawn into the frustration of taking her 'Work' at face value.Byron has you taking what life gives you with not one word on improving an undesirable situation. A problem will not resolve itself. Although she would say nothing is a problem (even having one arm which she talk about in the book). I just can't get past the denial of situations that she calls acceptance. Her defenition of acceptance seems to be resignation to the situation.
5,A Life Changer,"Applying these simple 4 questions seems too easy and too good to be true...but they Work...Doing ""the Work"" works...This ""technique"" lifts and can remove the ""load""...that most of us carry through life of being the victim and other emotional pitfalls.Another life changer."
4,Examining the strengths of our personal stories is worthwhile,"If you want to know what you really think - read this book and try the exercises. Read this book after you have read ""Secret of the Shadow"" by Debbie Ford. Seperately they are powerful enough, together, you definitely see your own story and how you can change it - you'll feel stronger and make better decisions for yourself.Invest your time!"
2,Inquiry is good - blaming Self for childhood abuse: bad,"Her work of always looking at one's part in things, as an ADULT, is the ticket to anyone's happiness. The problem with Byron Katie's work, is when people pour out their hearts regarding their childhood sexual and other abuse. She then does the ""turn-around"" where they BLAME themselves for their abuse, and not being ""loving"" to their perpetrators. See for yourself on Disk 6. Just don't try this at home.....I'm all for looking at my part of everything. But abusing children, is ALWAYS on the shoulders of the perpetrator - never ever should it be on the child. The child is weak. The adult is powerful. EVEN if the child ""allowed"" themselves to be raped for ""love"" - this is rape. It is exactly here, where I entirely lost my respect for The Work. Like I said, see for yourself. Do your own research.Happy Seeking!-R.E."
4,Loving What Is,This is a very interesting approach to a specific problem that is brothering you. The 4 questions let you see your problem in a different light. Does it work? Maybe? Is this for everyone? Probably not. There are no easy answers for a very difficult problem.
1,Total fake,"I agree with all 1 star reviewers, without having read them all. It is a complete fake. I bitterly regret the money and time I spent over it. I think she developed all this ""theory"" (???) as her own self defense against the odds in her own life. OK, but none of anybody else's business, and certainly not worth paying for, for God's sake!"
3,Loving What is : Four Questions that can Change Your Life,According to the author it wouldn't matter what anyone thinks- It is only important to the person reading the book.So why ask such a question?
2,Deeply Disappointed with quality of the 5th CD,"Of the series of 7 cds the 5th cd was unplayable, No way to contact you. No way to return the set, as they had been opened. Loving What Is was excellent and I would recommend the book definitely, and the CD set, only if it was a guranteed return to send back if there is a problem with sound or engineering on any 0f the CD's."
1,Could not get thru the first chapter,"Sorry, this one was to hard to read for me. It did not pull me into the story. I could not get past the first chapter. I loaned it out to someone before I read any more."
4,product,Ths product came in the condition that was stated it was. Came in a timely maner and at a very fair price.Thank you
4,"A boon for those who think we are victims, by changing how we see things.","From the depths of despair, Byron Katie found inner strength to ask herself four questions that changed her life and hence thousands of others as well. She calls these questions we can ask ourselves or have someone else ask them for us, ""The Work."" By looking at our life situations from a different perspective, we can move beyond the seeming difficulties to enjoying what is!""Katie"" provides many rich examples of circumstances for many different people and how they moved away from feeling down and out, to loving life as it presents itself. This is her premise to ""Loving What Is."" Acceptance is really a mind-set and is much better than blaming others or wallowing in our own self-pity. Learn to forgive and forget and our lives will seem to miraculously change!"
3,Not sure if it works....,"Lots of life's problems are real, unless you have distorted perceptions. Especially when people around you are seeing the same picture, it is not so practical to turn around it."
5,"If you are seeking personal growth and healing, this book is for you.","If you are tired of the fight, tired of always being angry or feeling defeated, read and apply Byron Katie's work. If you follow her words, do what she says, you cannot help but grow and relax.I was so moved and impressed by this book that I have been purchasing it and giving it away."
5,A must-read for most of the human race,"I've tried to think of people I know who WOULDN'T benefit from reading this book, and the only ones I can come up with are people who've read it already. Understanding and using Katie's simple system of ""inquiry"" can be a life-changing experience. It's surely worth anyone's time to find out what she's onto, and this book is a straightforward introduction to her approach to achieving greater happiness and satisfaction in life."
5,Love - Loving What is!,This book is so insightful! I really enjoyed it. It really helped me work through some of my issues.
3,Difficult to understand,"This is the first book of this writer I bought. Unfortunatley, the theme of this book went over my head."
2,old hat,"Another disappointment, I gave here Tiger-Tiger children's book and this one away to a survival center, maybe someone will get something out of these books. There is nothing new just a different emphasis."
3,Not my style,I bought this book on a recommendation but it wasn't for me! I don't have that many negative feelings to deal with.
2,I don't get it!,"I honestly don't get her stuff. It seems like real pop psychology vs. a way for people to achieve more happiness in life. It was recommended to me but I don't feel it was very useful or applicable. A little too, ""these 4 questions can resolve every problem in life."" Just don't see it! I'm not a believer in anything that says it will take care of everything. E.W."
5,I LOVE WHAT IT IS,"BRYON KATIE IS TRULY ONE OF A KIND. AFTER READING AND APPLING THE INQUIRY, THERE IS NO PLACE I CAN'T GO AND FIND PEACE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOOK AS WELL AS THE AUDIO CD'S. I AM RECOMMENDING THEM TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY."
5,The best ever to understand how my thoughts cause my pain!,"Byron Katie's work is incisive, clear, informative, confrontive yet gentle and compassionate, and she gets down to the nitty gritty of our false thinking and how we fool ourselves into thinking that ""someone else"" or ""something else"" is causing our discomfort or upset or emotional pain. Changed my life the first time I read it! Has been changing it ever since! If you want to be peaceful, joyful and happy, here's a place to start, a book that gives experiences you can relate to and shows us the way out of our human suffering and pain. It's positive, helpful and our transformation of mind can be as fast as we are willing to have it be! Enhanced my understanding of ""A Course in Miracles"" INCREDIBLY!!!!"
3,Average,"Very verbose, put me in my head when my issue is already over analyzing. But it got the dialogue going. Would probably be best used with a friend."
5,Transformational,"So simple you think it cannot be true but it is. This book will change how you relate to everything and release all burdens there were never really there. You can be on cloud 9 all the time, all illusions fade. She has save me lifetimes of lessons and learning. Thank you for this book that all can use and carry forth. The best part is the magic happens on its own."
1,Much better exists,"If you find this book useful, then good for you. There is much to be said for releasing ourselves from bad patterns of thought, but much better books exist than this one. The four questions are not that insightful. (Is it really useful to have two of the four questions be essentially the same question?) They are revealed in ways that exhibit logical flaws and great gaps in cause-and-effect reasoning.The ""turnaround"" is useful for people who are involved in some powerful or debilitating projections onto others, but it is not useful in other situations. Not every problem can be turned around onto yourself."
4,"Could change the world, but is that really true?","I have just finished this book and it has left me with more questions than answers. In the beginning I found the book excellent and honest and making a lot of sense. However towards the end it to me felt like just another philosophy. A child with a scraped knee is not really feeling the pain just remembering it, even 30 seconds after he has fallen??? Go figure? A chair might not really be a chair?? These are philosophical statements that many philosophers have already talked about and at the moment I feel this book has left me with much doubt and confusion especially on beliefs I have had my whole life. These beliefs I was at peace with before reading this book, however I had the impression that this theory of Katie Byron was supposed to enhance your beliefs and bring peace and self realisation...."
5,An Excellent Reality Check,"In Loving What Is, Byron Katie shows us how to get to the real issues of life. I found the audio book much more powerful than the print copy due to the conversations which demonstraight the principles in the book. Hearing the conversations gives you a much better feel for the emotions experienced by both sides and what to expect. In Loving What Is, we find that living in the real world can be far better than a world we make up for ourselves. It is not the events in our lives that cause us pain but what we think about them. This book helps you think differently."
1,Obnoxious and disgraceful,"I forced myself to read this book on the advice of a psychiatrist friend. The more I read, the more obnoxious I realized the entire concept to be. Maybe if she had kept to the idea that the way we perceive things is sometimes all we can control, there might have been value. But, to repeatedly say there is nothing we can do but accept what is goes against who we are as human beings. There are so many statements in this book that are just infuriating. One of the worst is on page 235 of the paperback edition. ""People who know there is no hope are free."" This is just outrageous and not what human life is about. Are we all to just throw our hands up and declare there is no hope? If that's a fact, why live at all? This book can be a cop out for some and a bit dangerous for others. It certainly has no value for either healthy or unhealthy human beings."
3,just because,i purchased this only because its a requirement for a sociology course. it has a lot of helpful life-skills lessons and requires some introspection.
1,I am so disappointed,"It doesn't work the letters a barely showing, I even changed the batteries and it still sucks. I checked it out before my company came over and I got everyone excited to play and you couldn't make out the words. What do I do, I want my game to work. Really I want to give it a minus point that's how upset I am about my purchase. :("
4,Uncut version is from Sinster only,"The Mondo DVD is a beautiful transfer of the widescreen Spanish language 'covered ' version.It is in Spanish and contains English subtitles.This release from Sinister contains the English export cut of the film, which has 4 sequences filmed with nudity and more sadism.These scenes are in the Mondo Spansih version, but are alternate, covered takes.The Sinister release is full screen and has some color problems, but it is in English and has the better exploitation content.Buy them both!"
3,"A Pattern Book, Not a Triangle Technique Book","There are some really nice, pretty quilt patterns in this book. But, from the title, I thought I was going to learn, in depth, new and wonderful fast, easy techniques for sewing triangles. Even some old techniques with details would have been nice. There is only 2/3 of one page devoted to this and that's pretty much it. Plus there are NO DRAWINGS or PICTURES of the different methods for making triangles! The 2/3 page offers a brief written descriptions of ""cutting squares in half to make triangles"", using foundation paper, fold and press triangles and stitching them into a seam, a fourth method too long to summarize, and a strip technique. I wanted pictures of using foundation paper, the strip method, accompanied by lots of pictures with step by step instructions. You're not going to get that here.However, I'm still enjoying the patterns. I'll just have to learn how to do the strip method for triangles and use foundation paper elsewhere."
4,MBCBS EX-PRESS (My Brain Can't Be Saved) Spring Issue Review,"Growing up I was subjected to EVERY type of music. Listening to this album brought back memories of being in my dad's car with his collection of 8-tracks of country & western music.The band labels themselves ""Fusion Rockabilly"". This is not your typical country (no dead dogs, getting out of prison,etc.) music.The musicianship and production of this album is top notch.The title track ""Mississippi Maserati Breakdown"", and ""Rip It Up"" are really [butt]-kickin, get-up-and-dance music.I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Rockabilly music.The album contains 11 cuts, some original, some cover. My favorites, besides the two I mentioned, would be ""Working Man Blues"", and their versions of ""Turn Around"" and ""Time Won't Let Me"".RRC (Former music critic, Asbury Park Press)"
4,Smokin' With Bill Turner & Blue Smoke,"They call it ""fusion rockabilly."" I don't know what to call it, but it sure IS different; somewhere between Nashville and Las Vegas, with some weird side trips in between. Production is so bright...ya gotta wear shades! Very nice package. 11 songs, CD and cassette."
1,Overheat and swells,This Ultralast battery overheated in cam to the point that it swelled and started to split at seams. Swelling was enough that battery cover wouldn't close. I've never had a prob with the original Sanyo battery. I'll pay a little more and get anothr Sanyo battery for my backup.
4,Good Value,"Certainly cheaper than the brand name battery, and so far seems to be working as well. Granted, I have not timed how long it lasts compared to the original, but seems to be comparable."
3,Q/A Problems?,"The copy I got was clearly a screw-up at the printing press, the first 30 pages or so were connected at the top (cut short at the botton), I had to ""tear"" then apart myself.The content of the book is/was fine. A fair amount on different people but I was hoping for a bit more interesting points of interest myself. Its a good resource for building adventures in the city that contain and/or interact with some of the more notable characters but it just kind of left me feeling like it should have contained more about underground characters/groups etc."
2,A missed opportunity,"This book contains a few good racing stories, but the information provided about production models is very basic. There are several facts presented which are inaccurate. Also, the photo captions don't always match the referenced photo. This book is NOT for the seasoned corvette enthusiast."
1,way off target...,"For $9.99 on the Borders sale table, my brother picked a softcover version of this book up for me to kill some time while we waited in an airport. The worst corvette book i've ever experienced. i gave it to a little neighborhood kid. anyway, the photos are terrible quality. it's mostly about special editions, racing, everything your average corvette owner doesn't care about. the standard 'vette is lost somewhere, over and over. i wouldn't allow the book in my hand picked library of corvette books, not even for $9.99."
3,Interesting history-- poor quality photograph printing,"This volume is quite interesting for the insight it provides into the times and marketplace that lead to the design & launch of Corvette. The discussion of the relationship between racing and the early production models is also well put together.However, the photographs, while nicely composed, are NOT well represented in this book. As another reviewer mentioned, many photos appear hazy-- as if they were shot through a filter of some sort. Having seen Newhardt's photography elsewhere, I think this is the result of poor printing, not the original photos. It is a shame given the size and detail of the photos that are included.Let's face it, this is a coffee table book and I am disappointed that the version as published falls short of what could have otherwise been a beautiful look at Corvettes throughout the make's 49 year history."
2,"a quote from 48 hours ""bubbles, man. bubbles.""","iconcept probably has a good product in the screen protector for my compaq ipaq. i had to remove and reapply because of the bubbles. when i reapplied, i followed the instruction by using credit card to slide across the sheet. still, i have bubbles but this time much less than just slaping it on without using the credit card. when i had to remove to reapply, i had to use a needle to initially get it going. i don't think that was a good idea to do on my expensive ipaq. anyone knows a better way? iconcept should have given a better removal instruction."
1,I have tried all the screen protector brands,This one is the worst among all. Stay away and buy anything else.
5,Dog vitamins,"These are a great way to supplement your dog's nutritional needs. But, don't forget: these are vitamins, not ""treats."" Read and follow the label instructions."
1,DO NOT GIVE THESE TO YOUR PET,"As seen on MSNBC 06/17/2011ConsumerLab also tested several pet supplements, one of which, Pet-Tabs Complete Daily Vitamin Mineral Supplement for Dogs contained lead at unhealthy levels.[...]DO NOT GIVE THESE TO YOUR PET."
5,My dogs love it!,"I have 5 Pomeranian and they all love it. I used to give some other vitamin pills (8 in 1 excell) and they were a bit tepid while taking it. These, though, they chase me around for. I haven't seen any visual effects but I'm sure its helping them inside."
2,All Synthetic vitamins,"I returned after researching the vitamins listed on label. dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate is SYNTHETIC vitamin E. Cyanocobalamin is Synthetic vitamin B12, etc. etc. These synthetic vitamins are not easily absorbed and most just produce expensive urine. They use these because they are CHEAP. I'm too picky about what I give my loved ones and only give them vitamins with NATURAL vitamins. Yes they cost more."
5,Dog love,"My dog waits for one every morning and her eyes are bright, tail is waggy, coat shinier--they must be working!"
2,incorrect item pictured,"the product pictured were Pet Tabs Plus, the product delivered were regular Pet Tabs. They are not the same. The picture has been changed since I ordered them."
5,Pet-Tabs Supplement for Dogs,Thanks for the speedy shipping! I will definitely use this supplier again.
5,zoo med,foam block for 501 turtle filter! what can you say about filter products?Work or don't! this one works! have tried other filters to no use!
3,mystery unsolved,"Finely written & empathetic fictional account of a mysterious episode in the lives of poets Laura (Riding) Jackson & Robert Graves, told from the point of view of the real-life Katherine Jackson, a woman whose husband, children, house & all possessions were divested from her in a single month by the aforesaid poet-houseguests. The author, a prominent biographer of Graves, obviously detests Riding (as did quite a few of her contemporaries); yet fails to create a convincing fictional character to account for these nearly unbelievable events. The book remains a kind of literary Gothic, with its subject no less shrouded in mystery than the principals (who contradict each other completely, or have categorically refused to talk about it) left it. Katherine, however, got the last laugh: she outlived them all, & recent biographers are tending to support her side."
2,"Decent speakers, but very bad package. Speakers arrived twice with broken covers.","When I received the speakers I found that both speakers had broken plastic cover. I called Amazon and they quickly replaced the speakers. However, both replacement speakers arrived with broken plastic cover again. I decided to keep the speakers and try to fix or glue the covers.Speakers sound ok, not the best, but ok. But covers are very bad and cheap inside. The speakers are too heavy and the must be packaged separately from covers to prevent cover damage."
4,QUALITY SPEAKERS,GOOD SOUND QUALITY.1 SPEAKER HAD A CRACKED GRILL AND SONY HAS NO REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR IT.
5,Wow....really. Wow.,"Couldn't be happier. These hit harder and deeper than any sub I have heard for under 300 dollars msrp.I would buy these again in a heart beat. Not as sharp or clear as Polks/Klipsch/etc, but still very nice, and they get down pretty low.Buy them...stop thinking about it."
5,Great sounding speakers,I have had these speakers along with the SS-CN5000 center channel and the SA-W3000 sub woofer for about 2 weeks now. They sound great. I have them hooked up to an Onkyo TX-SR606. I also bought two SS-B1000 bookshelf speakers to use as my 5.1 surrounds but do not have them hooked up yet.I do not understand how people bash Sony speakers simply because of the name without ever hearing them. I would never spend twice the money or more on a Polk speaker setup when I can get a set of these(I use Polk as an example because reviewers on AVSforums or other sites always seem to tell people to buy the Polks instead).I will admit I am not a pro when it comes to speakers but I like movies and music to sound as good as the next person and these have been great. I would recommend them to anyone.
1,Good Speakers if they didn't come broken,Very good sound.As advertised.Front speaker covers were broken. The plastic was broken into multiple pieces.I was very excited to receive this but it wasn't what I expected from Amazon.
5,Low cost does not mean poor quality,"I have bought the Sony SSF-7000 brand new a few months ago. I have since upgraded by buying a receiver, the Pioneer Elite SC-57; the flagship receiver. The Sony SF-7700 speakers blew my wife and me away. We decided to buy Bowen and Owens CM-9 speakers; the top of their line. The outcome? The Sony out performed the B & O speakers that cost 15 times the cost of the Sony's. If you can get over the status symbol you will be awed beyond words. I think Sony is selling their top speakers as a gift to all who want their electronics as a way of saying ""Thank Yoy"" for buying our products. The Sony SF-7700 do sound like 3000.00 speakers.My consolation for this endeaver is to decide which one will be rear and fronts for the surround sound set-up I am planning for the movie mode.Mr and Mrs. M.N."
5,Average: Don't get caught up in specs,"They are great but one needs a good receiver for these speakers to throw a punch. You can easily hear each speaker's(4) output very clearly making this a great start up bundle. I am using an old cd player system now, waiting to buy a new receiver and will compare the differences."
3,not bad for the price,Appear to be assembled rather cheaply - one of the cover grills was broken in shipping. The speakers work fine but are so slim that they have a somewhat top heavy appearance.
4,Great Speakers,"These speakers are freakin great. Yeah, you'll have the D-bags who push their glasses up their nose and talk about how great their Bose speakers are, but unless you're bench marking them side by side no one will ever know the difference. PLUS with the $500 you saved on the brand name you can buy a whole lot of other sweet stuff."
4,Great Product / Great Price,"My speakers arrived days after placing my order. Easy set up, well packaged and all cables/wires included. On top of all that... they sound Great"
5,Great speakers at a low price!,"I'm not a pro when it comes to speakers, but I bought these because I blew my home theater budget on the video side of things and needed to keep the speaker purchase reasonable. I'm so glad I did though because I hooked these up to my receiver and was blown away. I've read some reviews that said a subwoofer would likely be necessary to get the kind of low-end response you might hope for... but I had already bought a subwoofer for my home theater anyway so it's never been an issue for me. They look very impressive and can definitely get quite loud without any discernable distortion. I currently have them in a fairly big home theater room with 5 other surround speakers and the sound is great.When mine shipped, one of the speaker grilles was broken, but fortunately the company I purchased from sent a replacement grille that snapped right on with ease, so I have nothing but excellent things to say about these speakers.Highly recommended."
3,Towers are good!,I bought these to replace two small Sony fronts for my surround! I am not dissapointed although the sound is not truly superior they fill the bill very well.
2,"Great speakers! Shipping/packing, and Cover horrible!","I am currently waiting for a replacement, I have prime but Amazon is going to take 7 more days to get the replacement speakers shipped back. One of the speaker's covers was broken it had a black cover but the frame the cover was on is plastic which was broken. I really just wanted to replace the cover but Amazon has to have the whole set shipped back. Anyways I am now waiting... Speakers look great however! 7 more days till great sound, I got the sony small speakers (Sony SS-B1000 5 1/8-Inch Bookshelf Speakers (Pair))in the mean time, which do sound good as well. Amazon should give a partial refund for things not shipped in good condition! Product great, except for plastic cover, Shipping was horrible, UPS did not even bring it to our door had to go to our apartment office to get it. I even saw them leave it in the office! BAD UPS!"
1,WYGIWYPF,I should have learned enough lessons by this age but not so.What you get is what you paid for. So true.This is a perfect speaker for rap stuff but not for others. The distortion and annoying sound on the treble for orchestral or chorus is unbearable. I'm tossing to the dumster and buying a magnepan.
5,Sony SSF-7000 Floor Standing 4-way speaker,"Great sounds, size fits in well with furniture..............Front grill arrived broken ~~~ easily replaced, although part is on backorder."
3,speaker grills crushed in shipping,"These $200 speakers hooked up to a $200 Sony amplifier in the basement sound quite good. As expected, not as good as my more audiophile system upstairs at about 10 times the price but I am not disappointed in the sound for this price. My complaint is that the speaker grills (very flimsy) were broken during shipping and the distributor's returns policy requires that I package and ship the speakers back to them, way too much work considering the size and weight. The plastic legs on these speakers also look quite fragile and stick out so I'm glad that they were not damaged in shipping."
5,Proof that you need not spend a fortune for excellent speakers!,"I'm no expert, but I know what I hear. These speakers are clear and accurate. I can hear all the different musical instruments in the orchestra with so much clarity and accuracy now than I used to with my old BOSE speakers. Violins, flute, horns, harp, guitars, cello, xylophone, chimes, drums, clarinet... they all sound like they are supposed to, not colored and muddied up in one blend of painful, indistinguishable orchestral noise. Try playing your favourite band or orchestra CD and you'll know what I mean. For the price I paid, $216- delivered, these speakers are excellent value... I highly recommend them."
5,Rockin' Sonys in Ohio,"Replaced an aging pair of 25+ year old JVC knock-offs, as my main living room speakers.I'm so glad I got these, over the 6"" single woofers, these ROCK! They are kind of tall, up to my sternum, but sound quality is great & they are sleek enough to save floorspace in my narrow living room.Price was very reasonable & they arrived a day earlier than expected.It feels like my FIRST day of 5.1, or 6.1, all over again!"
3,Not too happy,"I recently wanted to upgrade my Polk R30s to get a larger sound stage so I purchased the Sony SS-F7000. After replacing them I felt like the new speakers were actually worse than my $100 pair Polks. So I hooked them both to my receiver for an A-B test (Panasonic SA-XR57 with Dual Amp configuration, subwoofer disabled, large configuration, and stereo test. Its known for its high end clarity due to being a digital amp). My wife and I agree, the Polk R30s have a much better sound stage and clarity for instruments, particularly the sax and bass. The one thing better on the Sonys is the low end of course, however as a whole I still prefer the Polks, so the Sonys are going back."
4,Hearing is believing,"Really great speakers for the price.Nice 'footprint'.Great field of sound.Great transients.Bass is surprisingly solid and full. (don't use sub-woofer so my a/v amp. directs the lows to the mains)Overall brilliance, color, and realness is about 6 or 7 on a scale of 1-10. But a 10 would be speakerscosting a few thousand dollars.I am very, very happy with this purchase."
4,Not bad for what they cost,I bought these to replace a couple of old Infinity speakers I had that had blown and had the woofers replaced. They look great in my living room since I have a black modern theme going. They're taller than I expected. They sound great but the low frequency response is lacking. For the size of the cabinet I would expect them to hit a little lower. Someone suggested putting some batting in the cabinet to increase the low frequency response and I may try doing that to see if it improves.
4,GOOD GUITAR METAL,"This is some great early technical metal, in the vein of Watchtower or even Annihilator. NOT some stupid DJ like the description depicts.stupid Amazon."
2,Did not work very well,This item was a little hard to use and did not do a good job of removing water from glass shower doors because it left streaks. The good grips squeegee works much better at a better price.
3,Cleret Dual Bladed bath squeegee,"I was very excited to receive this squeegee, as we'd had a similar one before, but with a handle. The squeegee works well, but it is really not user friendly. It needs a handle, because the round cylindrical piece that houses the two blades is not comfortable or easy to hold. I only give this squeegee 3 stars because of the lack of a handle."
4,Does it's job,"This squeegee does it's job very well. Once the door dries after being squeegeed, it looks very clean. The only issue is holding it. The handle is a little strange and it's hard to get used to."
5,A Gardener's Tale is a wonderful place to visit.,"If you love gardening (or simply being in them), are interested in natural healing and the uses of herbs, if you are intrigued with history and mythology,and are touched by true friendship, you can't help but be literally charmed by this book. The tale itself is exotic, the garden lush and intricate and so it is fitting that the prose is simple and straightforward and sets the pace exactly as the main character would have it: calm, sensitive, quiet. A Gardener's Tale is told with all the awe and respect that storytellers have employed from the very beginnings of human society (for this was, and is, how precious knowledge and essential understanding are passed on from one generation to the next, from one century to the next). I was careful to pace my reading so I could live that much longer in the beautiful garden. I recommend it highly and rate it a 6 out of 5! I'm also hoping to enjoy more work by this author."
3,Tony Gerber - 'Blue Western Skies' (Lektronic Soundscapes) 3 1/2 stars,"Tony Gerber is the main man behind Nashville's new age/space electronic band,Spacecraft.'Blue...' looks to be Gerber's first out of six solo efforts.I had NO idea he had that many solo discs available.Gerber plays guitar,keyboards and harp through out the CD with additional musicians guesting on several of the tracks.Cuts I thought were decent include the well arrainged seven-minute ""As Time Passes"",""Morning Prelude"",""The Badlands"" and the ten-minute ""Lunar Crossing"".Two of the disc's best tracks were the stellar ""Frozen Waters"" and ""Surrounding Ground"".Allow this piece of work to take your mind into another dimension."
4,One of the most fun and exciting PS2 games I've ever played!,"As a fan of the Ice Age franchise, I must say that this game is tons of fun! It feels just like the movie! You get to play as Scrat, Sid, Manny and Diego in the melting universe. Good graphics and voice work make this a must-own!"
4,"Tutorials, exercises, training videos and more","The Flash Professional 8 Beyond The Basics for Shane Rebenchied is a practice book that includes some useful tutorial for both Flash designers and developers. About 50 step-by-step tutorials cover many needed techniques to create a professional Flash application. Such as, formatting dynamically loaded text using HTML, CSS and nested images, building preloader with the MovieClipLoader class, adding a progressively downloading multi-track MP3 player and using component to create a feed back form.For the first time I looked at the book index, I felt like the tutorials are not very well organized, but with another deep look, I realized that the tutorials are pinpoint the problems you may face when creating a Flash application in a professional way.The book also includes a CD-ROM with exercises and training videos."
3,Good Book - Needs Updates,"I needed a book like this where every exercise is just a little beyond my level of expertise. Highlights: 1) thorough explanations of loading movies and variables, 2) a great chapter on building a concise preloader. I did, however, find a flaw in the Actionscript code for the chapter on building an MP3 player. When I attempted to contact the author and the publisher I was told that there was nothing wrong with the code. After having other people test the code on various computers we all found the same thing. I'm wondering how the author missed such an obvious bug in his code and whether there are more less-obvious bugs elsewhere. I don't think any of this would be a problem if the author and Lynda.com would maintain some sort of code update of known bugs in their code."
5,Excellent,"Fast Service, Fast Delivery, As it was described, Will Definitely buy from this seller again."
4,"Even with John Bon Jovi and Tony 'The Graz' Graziani, it's still a great Arenaball colletors piece!","""Come on everybody, there's a rumble in the house!""Thanks you very little Jon Bongiovi (his real name).Well, Jon finally won his ArenaBowl (XXII, in NewOrlean, Super Bowl City) in 2008, just ahead of thelockout of the Union players in 2009. Arena2 stillplayed in 2009 and both merged into Arena Football1 in 2010. Thye may change their name back to AFL.Stay Tuned, unless you are a fish - and check outthe greatest sport ever invented in the historyof the universe, thsi spring, 2010 on the NFLNetwork!"
5,pretty spooky if you ask me!,"John Carpenter's second best, right behind Halloween. This movie is very effective, very fun, and has the best ending I've ever seen in a movie."
1,Not as Advertised,"I was dismayed when I received this DVD along with 2 other similar DVDs in the same order to find that unlike the covers shown in Amazon.com, the dvds are actually cable versions and not the adult unrated versions as suggested.Beware and save your money!"
1,Sucks,Don't waste your money on this movie unless you are into the crappy cable version of this movie cuz thats what it is.
1,Not A Fan Winner,"I have read all of the reviews, and I must admit, Garth has a lot of loyal fans. It is terribly hypocritical to call Shania Twain ""un-country"", when she is really only being herself. Whereas Garth Brooks will only release a mainstream pop/rock album donning a wig, facial hair, and a new name. What is going on here? Twain's success has been credited to her husband/producer, her management team, her wardrobe. Everyone but her! How many more albums does she have to sell? How many more ""non-country"" fans does she have to sway to her music?Brooks seems too afraid to go completely pop/rock, hence the character. When will you come out from behind the wig, Garth? When this album sells 10+ million? Have your fun, but stick with what you're great at. Millions of fans will agree."
1,Gimmicky and Musically Weak,"Chris Gaines or not,this album is a soft, ""Ive-heard-it before"", piece of hype.The strongest cut on the album is probably ""Right Now"", an amalgum of the Youngbloods' ""Get Together"", and Cheryl Wheeeler's ""If It Were Up To Me"".Yet,with heavy-handed artistic licence, Brooks significantly alters-or rather, butchers-the Wheeler original.By omiting the last line of the song:""If it were up to me Id take away the guns"", Brooks dismisses entirely its essence.Wheeler wrote the song in response to the senseless Jonesboro killings of 1998.It is a powerful comment on our times.Listen to it on her album""Sylvia Hotel"", and forget Chris Gaines"
1,AARGH!,Will the real Garth Brooks please be seated? Brooks'latest musical offering is appropriately overshadowed by his inappropriate marketing strategy. Puleeeze!
1,Self-Indulgent Garbage,"Garth Brooks would have an easier time convincing me that he's Claire Daines than a hip rock star named Chris Gaines in this poor collection of retreaded, unimaginative psuedo-pop. If this album had to exist, it should have been released as a regretable soundtrack in accordance with the release of ""The Lamb.""Brooks would have been smart to have looked to the failed attempt of Bruce Willis to invent a similar musical entity in the '80's. Maybe we would have been spared this piece of ... music."
1,garth has lost his real fans in the life of chris gaines,"he has finally let his money and greed overcome his roots. i hate to say that about a legend and a hero, but shout i must. all of us who loved, adored, and modeled him everyday of our lives have been decieved. he has lost the faith i once had in the greatest man on earth.he was. never again. he let us down: please do not support this imposter in purchasing this album."
1,Garth showing his true colors for the world to see!,"The idea of a ""country"" performer performing rock is not new in country music. Many were doing it before they knew there was such a thing. Many artists who were big in country tried it on as rock. Buck Owens became ""Corky Jones"" and George Jones tried it on as ""Thumper Jones"". So, even though I'm not a big Garth fan, quit criticizing the man for trying it on as a rock star. My criticism would be, though, he's finally showing his true colors. The man claims KISS as one of his influences-very far removed from country. The man has never been capable of anything but watered down country to start with, so why should this thing be a suprise?"
2,not a bad attempt,"I think Garth is just getting bored and was attempting something new in this project of his. Although there were a few interesting tracks like ""Snow In July,"" the majority of the C.D was boring and basicly lifeless. The whole album sounded as if every song had been edited over and over until the only thing left was a hollywood production. Not a C.D I would buy or even bother to check out, nice try Garth!"
2,fooled by vh1,"I cant belive it,gulp hook line and sinker the life and times of chris gaines as told by vh1 a great story of a fairytale cleche rock musician presented in a true story setting. who wrote this i dont know but i almost bought it."
1,Garth sells out,"""Lost in You"" sounds like a song that N""Stync would cover and the rest of this ""album"" suffers because of it."
1,What was he thinking?,I am huge Garth Brooks fan so I was really excited to hear he was releasing a new CD. When I read about the concept of it I was intrigued. So I finally was able to buy and I listened to the first half. that was about all I stand. It was horrible. The next day I put it on again to see if I could stomach more of it. I made it through the entire CD but didn't really care for it at all. He needs to stick to country.
5,Way of the Girl,"Not meaning to sound crude, but I'm glad Garth had the b---s to do this one. I love it! I've purchased several copies of it for gifts, and so far, everyone I've shared it with likes it just as much as I do D---ED GOOD CD!"
4,An excellent change in music for Garth Brooks!,"If Garth was looking to change his style, he sure chose the right path to do so.I found this album rather fresh and new for him, you can't help but notice his new approach to music. And the fact that Garth it seems is telling his own story through the eyes of the fictional character Gaines. Hats off to a new start Brooks!!"
4,"This is a Gaines album, not Garth...","Granted, it's Garth Brooks' face and voice on the album, but it's Gaines' life that's being portrayed. Reading some of the other listener reviews, their criticisms seem somewhat odd. Of course the songs sound dated -- this is an album of non-existent ""hits"" from the past thirteen years. And it is ""pop""...though I don't think that's as derogatory a term as some of you do. What we have here is an established artist willing to put himself on the line in order to try something *new and different*. Motives aside (since I really doubt any of you live inside Brooks' head), what this album *really* is is an experiment. And to me, it succeeds beautifully. There are some mis-steps here and there, but overall, it's an incredibly compelling concept and album."
5,Most Underrated Album in Decades!,"I use to listen to Garth Brooks, Chris Gaines was and is one of if not the best artistic work maybe ever done. Garth Brooks really hit a home run with this baby, Too bad he listened to the red necks and never finished ""The Lamb"", (The movie as Chris Gaines) I would guess that would have been equally as good. Personally I think wealth and fame made Garth Brooks second guess and doubt himself artistically and got lazy / scared to lose his base instead of reaching for the stars.An Excellent Album!Love you Garth,Jeff"
4,Wish more artist had the power & guts to do this,"I think this is fun stuff. A great artist stretching the boundries and getting out of the box everyone has placed them in. I wish they would've gone ahead with the movie. Garth's videos were done so well, I think a movie would've only been better. Different writers and producers along the ""timeline"" of Gaines career would've given a greater range in style/sound, and moved even further from the Garth Brooks sound. But I do like it overall.""That's the Way..."", ""Unsigned Letter"", and ""It Don't Matter..."" are good songs. ""White Flag"" is my favorite.Come on Garth resurrect this thing and do an indie film; play out your vision for this! Your instincts have served you pretty well so far."
5,It is just great!,It's really good but i'm kind of confused about the whole name thing but other than that it rocks!!
4,Garth ventures into pop music...and mostly succeeds,"This is an interesting and eclectic album. It starts out strong with R&B and funk rhythms. Two of my favorite tracks are, ""Snow In July"" and ""That's the Way I Remember It"". The centerpiece of the recording is the song, ""Right Now"" which is being released to Top 40 radio stations in the near future. Whether these radio stations actually play it is another matter. But it is an excellent song. The last third of the album, however, isn't quite as strong as the rest. They sound too much like late 80's rock. Of course, they're supposed to sound like that because that's what Garth (Chris) wanted. But I would have preferred that the entire album be as funky as the first several tracks. Overall, though, this is a very enjoyable listen and Garth's voice sounds fantastic. Give it a try!"
2,One mans Gaines is another mans Pains,"I'm thankful for the psuedo-name, that way I can still say I love Garth's music. In my humble opinion, this CD is bland, lifeless and without soul. I can't imagine the stress that must be put on an artist to keep things fresh and inovative; However, I think he's trying way too hard to be on top. Garth, if this is what your feeling inside God Bless you & play on. If this is a marketing ploy for your new movie ""shame on ya'""This compilation will be in the discount racks very soon."
2,"Great concept, mediocre music","I was looking forward to hearing this album, especially after I heard it was produced by Don Was. The concept of creating the music of a fictional artist was very interesting to me. However, after listening to the actual music I am disappointed. I do like several of these songs, but nothing here stands out to me as something that will hold up to the test of time. Rather than creating a separate musical persona, most of these songs sound like parodies of well-known pop artists. Sometimes I wonder if the songwriters and musicians who worked on this project were intentionally trying to make Chris Gaines an unoriginal artist with second-rate material. If so, they succeeded."
2,Wasted my money,"I saw the special on TV which made me curious enough to buy the CD. I can admire Brooks for his attempt at something musically different. But, I will not be listening to this one again. He sounds like Prince trying to do Country. Yuck. I was expecting something a little more sincere, rock, or raw. The music just doen't have any ""sparks""."
5,"Hesitant at first, but won over by one great album!","I hated country music until four years ago when Garth's ""Standing Outside the Fire"" won my ears and my heart. His music is great. Now, I'm a full blooded country lover thanks to Garth. I was intrigued by his move to do pop through Chris Gaines. It seemed like a brilliant move, almost too brilliant to sell to the public. I was worried I wouldn't like it, but Garth is a true artist. This album is amazing! For anyone who has grown up in the last thrity years, this album is like a scrapbook of the music styles with which we grew up. The lyrics are beautiful and provoking! Great job Garth! Can't wait to see the movie. I may even start listening to contempory pop again."
4,Amazing Alter-Ego,"How cool! To be able to live an entirely different persona and have that person be equally as talented. Plus, Chris Gaines is gorgeous! What next, Garth?"
5,And this will lead to..............?,"I think this album is simply amazing. But, for those of you who liked it, could you imagine if he released all of the Chris Gaines albums ever recorded? He could have both Garth and Chris albums in production at one time. It would be strenous on him, I know, but it is still an interesting idea. MORE CHRIS GAINES!"
1,Give Me a Break!,"I loved Garth Brooks the country singer, but that was almost a decade ago. The ubiquitous Brooks has decided one man can't grab enough brass rings. This music belongs in pop genre, and I sincerely hope it stays there."
3,Chris Gaines Gretest Hits,"This sound is more of a pop cd than anything else. I purchased it for my son, who is a big Garth Brooks fan. He says it is okay, but when you are used to the big sound of Garth and country, this pales in comparison. I am glad I purchased it, but I was surprised that is more of a pop sound. I think I thought it might contain some Rock."
3,Not bad.,"I have never bought a Garth Brooks CD. I don't like country, but I was curious about this CD, because it was touted as not being country. Well, I listened to track 4 in the store by accident, and I had to buy the CD. ""Lost in You"" and especially ""Drifin' Away"" are beautiful. Garth is talented. Overall, it's not a bad CD. I listen it and think it's okay. It's not on my stink pile of CD's or anything, and I know whenever I want to hear a ridiculously gorgeous song, I play ""Drifin' Away"". I think Garth should be commended for being ambitious and managing to pull it off. He doesn't seem to be disowning himself from the music that made him popular so what's the big deal. He's not pulling a Mariah Carey, so leave him alone. He'll go back to country and then y'all can quit crying!"
4,Not your daddy's Garth,"First off, people need to remember this is NOT Garth Brooks. Sure, it's him in the wig, but this isn't his music. His voice is hard to diguise, but with all the copy-cat bands around now, is it hard to believe that a rock singer would sound like a country singer? A few of the early tracks sound a bit Garth-ish, but over all, this is a DIFFERENT artist. ""Right Now"" has a great, pop-rock sound and feel. ""Main Street"" will appeal to fans of folksy type bands like the Tommy Shaw-Jack Blades album. Overall, Chris Gaines rocks as Garth Brooks cross-genre alter-ego."
1,"Get over yourself, Garth!","What a waste of time! Garth took a big risk in making a pop/rock album and, after listening the songs (at a record store....I certainly didn't buy it), it seems to be a bigger risk than ever. On some songs, it sounds like he is trying to imitate the N Sync or the Backstreet Boys while on other he seems to be trying to get in touch with his ""hippy"" roots. A few of the songs are okay, but it's clear that Garth is NOT a rock star, no matter how hard he tries. Save your money!"
2,attempt to reinvent seems bland,"I respect Garth Brooks tremendously as an entertainer, a businessman and a marketing genious, but his new project seems to fall short of his usual greatness. I find the songs (predominatly written by the same writters) to be extremely bland with little variation. Any garth fanatic will love the album..basically the guy could sing nursery rhymes and it would go triple platinum, but I just find the tunes to be a bit dull"
1,Complete and utter trash ....,Garth doesn't even do country good ... now he is totally making a fool of himself trying to do soft-rock.
2,Snow in July is correct - this stuff is very luke warm!,"This album is being promoted as being ""hot."" However, it is very luke warm. Snow in July (one of the psedo-funk songs) is an accurate description of the album. However, once you really listen to it you see that Garth is just acting out a fantasy of his. So why not let him have his fun?"
4,"Different-great, the typical unusual Garth","Great sounds, few songs share resemblance to other songs, one reminds me of God Bless America (lol...ok, maybe that's stretching it) but it's still a really fun CD that will grow on you in a hurry!"
3,Definitely NOT country but still enjoyable,"If you're looking for another country music album from superstar Garth Brooks, look somewhere else. While the album has a unique sound and a terrific musical perspective, it is definitely not a country one. I was disappointed to find it located under the country section at my local music store. I thought this would be country with a twist, only to find that it was country if it was twisted into a pretzel. Still, all in all, the sounds are unique and Garth's voice is still terrific. An album that needs to grow on you. One thing is for sure -- Garth is a marketing genius."
1,garth go home,garth you are a lousy artist but why do i say artist you dont write your own songs any way you are just a lonely show man i know you printed 3.1 million of this cd and it has had such a poor showing that you have cut the prics from 12.58 to 9.99 and you have sold may be 1 million your xmas cd is as bad it entered the billboard @13 that should tell you if you are going to give away cds you will have to do it at mcdonalds for 4.99 and free egg mcmuffin hey garth mail me back
1,I can't give it less than one star?,"You people amaze me. Garth Brooks has never been about country music, and this ""Chris Gaines"" marketing ploy should be your final wake up call. Garth's ""country"" albums have been as dishonest as this piece of product, and none of you have understood this. When I first saw a Garth Brooks in-concert video, and watched him smash his guitar and amp, I thought to myself: ""I saw Peter Townsend do this on the Smothers Brothers show in 1969! This isn't country"". You want country, then pick up the latest Dixie Chicks, listen to Lee Ann Womack, or check out Charlie Robison's ""Life of the Party"". You want a pop masterpiece, any Sinatra will do. Just not this Chris Gaines junk...it'll rot your brain. Don't say I didn't warn you. Not that you'd know the difference..."
1,A true oddity...,"It has been said there is nothing better than seeing a lost performer find his way home. This cd is the exact opposite. The amount of ego in this cd is sad, and I think it only works to cover for Garth's insecurity and personal knowledge about his career. He knows he is the result of marketing. Any album, such as Sevens, that has to sell seven million copies to make up for the cost of advertising, is a marketing tool and not a work of art. Garth's career, although impressive at times, is nothing more than marketing and gimics. Limited edition sets, box sets, double disc sets priced at $10 a pop, etc...Christmas albums rereleased a year later with 3 new tracks...In the end Garth is nothing. What happened to the movie this cd was supposed to represent? Garth is a true failure...his fans can hide behind statistics...but marketing is what has propped him up."
1,One star is too many,"This album is something that should never have been released. Just because he likes another band, and wants to write a song in their style (but of much lower quality) does not make for a good album. He must be bored with his country-pop songs and want tp ""experiment"". However, if you lack talent and/or imagination, one should not do this. He should be happy he sells records when he wears a cowboy hat and a belt, and stick with that."
1,The Cowboy Has Gone Schizo,"This is the type of thing you dream about. A bloated celebrity making a horrible slip like this. This is the type of thing a whole country can mock. I hope Garth ( or Chris?) likes shame, because he's gonna receive a heapin' helpin'."
1,Still Garth,"Not as original as I thought it would be, still sounds like Garth, but the thinner look is nice."
1,Who called this music?,I like garth but I like light bulbs too and petting my cat in the hammock during a cold rain shower makes my back itch the way it used to during the world series.
2,Great Idea- Poor Execution,"What a wonderful concept- a fictional artists and his ""greatest hits"". What a wonderful concept gone wrong!This ""greatest hits"" collection is awful. If this is supposed to be the body of work of a superstar, we are all in trouble. Chris Gaines comes off as a wimpy soft rocker without an ounce of charm or charisma.I don't get it. I looked forward to this release with more anticipation than any other. It just doesn't work.As a tried and true Garth Brooks fan, i couldn't stand this set. I can only imagine what non fans must think.Garth really strikes out with this set for the first time in his career."
5,The album is Garth--in a whole new light!,"I have been a proud supporter of Garth for numerous years. I understand that many people will neither accept this album, nor give credit due to Garth,however, this is a different side of Garth Brooks and as long as everyone listens and gives opinons with an open mind, ""In the life.."" will be a success. No matter what the sales or billboard charts say."
5,Garth Rocks as Chris Gaines,"This CD proves that Garth is a master at whatever he does. The lyrics are great, the songs have soul and a beat that will have you dancing. This is a CD you can't put down, nor get the songs out of your head. One word: Addicting. The vocal range of Garth is exceptional and perfectly natural sounding. For the life of me, I can't imagine anyone disliking this CD. He is great at country, and once again he has managed to go outside the lines and it's done with exceptional quality. I give it 5 stars."
1,Comercialized garbage at its worst!,"Garth has friends in Low Places - and now he has an album destined for low places. This is commercialized garbage that a singer without Garth's name recognition could not even get released. His fans write rave up reviews of this album - but in truth this is a very, very forgetable collection. Not a single stand out. If Garth keeps this up he will be surpassed by Tim McGraw and other hot country acts."
1,"A joke, that isn't even funny","With the release of the painfully horrible CD, Garth Brooks proves once again that his ego knows no bounds.What is obvious is that Brooks hopes to abandon country music. Country music has seen steadily declining sales over the past few years, a trend that, not coincidentally, seems to tie in with its selling out it roots in favor of a bland, safe, suburban guy in cowboy hat feel (which, of course, was led the way by Garth). Now that these sales are off, Garth hopes to jump ship into the pop field. Chris Gaines is merely his testing ground. If it is a big success it is bye bye Garth and hello Gaines. If it is a bomb, he can return to country music, (or his bland version thereof) claim that was Gaines, not him, and then plot his next manipulative gimmick that he must rely on to sell CDs since his horrible music can't stand on its own."
1,P. T. Barnum was right,"After hearing these songs, watching the TV special, and trying to figure it all out, I've come to a rather obvious conclusion: This CD is the biggest display of rampant ego disguised as a ""concept album"" in the history of music. This comes of the heels of Garth trying to be a ""baseball player."" The American public truly deserves Garth Brooks, Adam Sandler, and Dawson's Creek to go along with their overconsumption of soft cheese. Disgusting."
5,An eclectic masterpiece of Garth's hidden talents,"Garth's music has always touched the heart of his listeners,as Chris he touches the innermost depths of my soul, making me feel the joy, pain, peace and despair. I cannot stop listening to this cd. It is so totally different from anything Garth has done. So powerful it draws you in,and when the cd is over, leaves you wanting more. As a Garth fan from the beginning,I had to hear this new cd.We have only touched the tip of Garth's ""iceberg."" I look forward to the next step in Garth's multi-talented musical life. If you love music this cd is a must for you . Bravo Garth and Chris !"
5,Wonderful & REFRESHING!! We have been waiting for this!,"I have never been a fan of country music, but I have always respected the talent of Garth Brooks. I found this so intriguing that he would write songs for the rest of us to listen to. So, out of curiosity I bought it. It is absolutely WONDERFUL!! It's about time we had something REFRESHING to listen to. I am so tired of all the music they play on the radio now days, that when I get in the car, I don't even turn the radio on. Until now!! Now I have his CD playing constantly. I JUST LOVE IT!! My only disappointment is that Garth won't always be singing this kind of music. Those of you trying to compare his music to the ""alternative"" type, don't know what your talking about. He is not going for the ""alternative"" style. He is just playing GOOD MUSIC!! Comparative to James Taylor. WELCOME GARTH!! KEEP IT UP!!!!"
4,Not typical Garth,"Not typical Garth Brooks, but very good. It shows Garths ability to play other types of music and do it well. Give a good listen to tracks six and eight, I think Garth fans will be pleased."
2,I was hoping for less pop and more fire.,"Comparing Garth Brooks to Chris Gaines should be like comparing apples to oranges... but I'm going to do it anyway. A big GB fan, the idea of Garth creating a new persona intrigued me and I purchased the album as soon as it was available. For the most part, I feel the album lacks a certain amount of soul. I guess it could be expected from someone who doesn't really exist. I was hoping for an ""In Pieces"" which kept my heart dancing throughout, but instead found ""Right Now"" wonderful, ""Maybe"" and ""My Love Tells Me So"" good, and the other 10 songs just not striking a resonance with me. I guess I was hoping for a little less pop and a little more fire. Garth may have been keeping one eye on the safety net with this risk, instead of just closing his eyes and letting go."
2,Pick a musical style Garth!,"Music is okay, lyrics okay...can't figure out if I'm listening to Back Street Boys or the Wallflowers...Come back to country Garth..."
3,Not original but good!,"first, forget the visual, and then give it a try! you might like it! But he didnt had to create all this just to sing POP, had you Garth? and he looks to strange in that wig! if he had released with his true name it would had gonne better on the sales, because would be more true!"
3,"Good music, but not the pop image he strove for","Garth is a country singer. He can put on an odd haircut and hire a great band to put a grooving backbeat to his country songs, but his voice and music are still Garth. I like the CD and am interested in the new sound, but the image and melodramatic album jacket are just plain stupid. If he does try to release a movie based on this I forsee a huge failure, sad, but likely."
1,INNOVATIVE! <snicker>,"What a great idea, invent an alter ego and create an album based on his life and music. Amazing, what will Garth do next? You should tell David Bowie about this idea of yours, he'd probably like to give it a try also. Aside from the sarcasm, this is still a bad album. What Garth is trying to pass as Rock and Roll comes across more as something of a lame joke that nobody gets. As a result he's forced to go on talk shows and Good Morning America to promote this trash. but I guess his target audience watches shows like that so it's probably a good move. And while Garth will never fit into the Artist category, he is still quite the cash-machine, with a Christmas CD already on the way. So if you like your music empty and bland then Garth should fit your bill. If you want some really incredible music then look elsewhere."
4,Country Star Tips His Hat To Rock,"Ever wonder what Garth has been hiding under that 10-gallon chapeau? Well, country's Midas man doffs it for this image-shattering soundtrack album for a film Brooks is developing in which he will star as a long-locked, mod-dressing rock star named Chris Gaines.While seemingly a risky career move by Brooks, who has long flirted with rock and pop styles without turning off the enormous mainstream country audience that brung him to the dance, this outing isn't really that much of a stretch. That's because Brooks's vision of a rock star is more Kenny Loggins than David Bowie.A sure sign that he prefers rock's less clangorous pathways comes when his alter ego sings a snippet of a tune (""Get Together'') by '70s troubadour Jesse Colin Young of the Youngbloods. The songs here are tuneful and mellow, but for pyrotechnics, catch one of Garth's geetar-smashing country shows."
1,Garth Blows,"Garth - I like the way you hold your guitar on stage. Please don't try to play it. Nobody outside a trailer park has ever bought this cd. That's where I heard it. My car broke down in front of Clem's house, so I went in to use his phone to call Jethro's Towing. Thay luved that thar cd. I didn't."
1,Ranked Up There,"I rank this Chris Gaines cd, and in fact all Garth Brooks cds right up there with my Barry Manilow, Billy Ray Cyrus, Monkeys, Bay City Rollers, and any Kenny Rogers duet. This is just as good as any of those."
3,"Good CD, but in poor shape","The CD is great and I was glad I found it. It said I was ordering a new CD that was still in the original wrapping. When I got it, the cd was obviously used, not in a wrapping, and the case was even cracked. I was disappointed."
5,Give him a chance!,"Give the man a chance to expand his horizons. Based on its own merits, it really is a good album. I love the title track! It is a shame that the movie never made it into real life. We might have had another ""classic"" cult movie here."
4,Thoroughly impressed by GB,"I was somewhat skeptical about this ""new"" sound, but after listening to the CD once, it quickly became my favorite. I absolutely love it! Garth needs to get the songs out to a different crowd though because this isn't country! My favorite songs are ""that's the way i remember it,"" ""it don't matter to the sun,"" and ""right now."" ""Right now"" has to be the best song on the CD. I am just stunned that it was so great because I had heard some bad reviews, but I have to say I HOPE CHRIS GAINES RELEASES ANOTHER ALBUM BECAUSE I'M SURE TO BUY IT! =)"
5,"Crossing the ""Music Line"" was the BEST Thing Garth's done",I've been a Garth fan since the beginning but it seemed that he was tring really hard in his last attempts. This is where he has proven me wrong. The best work he has done since his very first album. A must buy for any music fan not just a Garth fan.
3,How disconcerting!,"Well, first of all, this album sounds like it's a bunch of covers of other songs but yet... not. Not a hint of originality. Garth is obviously really full of himself, he needs to just stick with his redneck fans instead of making a parody of another musician. Puh-leeeez. Get an identity!!!Bad move turning on your fans, there, Garth... especially if you can't even win over us non-fans.Now then, am I the ONLY one who noticed that Garth looks identical to Johnny Rzeznik (Goo Goo Dolls) on the cover of the CD? It's uncanny! Too bad Garth isn't really that gorgeous. Good lighting and make-up trick, though!"
4,One of Garths best,This CD was the best of Garth Brooks. Garth is a great country artist but he can rock with the best. My favorite song is Driftin Away. It is just the kind of ballad that I like to hear Garth sing. I also like It Dont Matter to the Sun. and Snow in July. This CD is totally different from anything he has done and although I love Garth as a country artist I think this will be a fun ride.
5,Caught me by surprise............,"I never would have thought that I would enjoy Garth Brooks (not a country music fan), but this album and his portrayal along with it is pretty sweet, I must admit. Who else has changed their image in way like Garth does here, especially with the pseudo-Behind The Music stint they did? Every track on the CD is great and I would recommend anyone adding it to their collection."
5,No twang here,"I like Garth Brooks generally but this album is something else entirely. If you're not a country and western nut, but have a broader set of tastes, I think you'll like this album about a fictional rock star. It quickly became a favorite album of mine and it really made me laugh to see the ""Garth-heads"" become incensed about this betrayal. Lighten up guys - it's his career. If you don't like the album, don't buy it. Personally, I think it's one of the best things he's ever done."
2,"Ummmmmmmm,,,,,,","This has to be the Ziggy Stardust of the 90's.The TV special was unusual to say the least and well,,,,so is this CD. Stick to country music Garth or get into Pop as a real person! Weird!"
2,WHY DID HE CHANGE HIMSELF LIKE THAT?,"Garth Brooks was my favorite artist. I have every CD that he has ever made and now he has changed so much. On the cover of his CD, he looks so sickly and looks like he is about to die. I just wish he would go back to his old self as Garth Brooks."
1,Lost . . . His mind.,"Anybody who gives this pathetic, poseur album five stars would give five stars to an album called ""Toilet Sounds -- as Recorded Live at the Truck Stop Bathroom."" What is wrong with you people? The only explanation is that Garth is entering all of these ridiculous comments by hand, himself. It'd be a better use of his time than making the album."
1,"Garth, we hardly knew ye.","After millions of albums sold, Garth has finally lost his mind. The persona is stupid. The music is worse. Garth is doing this so all the critics look at him and say, ""Wow, he's really brave. He really wants to be an Actor, and he's SOOOO into his role."" And he talks about Chris Gaines in the third person. ""Well, Chris cut the Triangle album with more of an R&B Feel."" Stupid.Your act is wearing thin, Garth. You're a phony, and the humble act won't work anymore."
1,Da!,"In a lot of the reviews here, the writers refer to Garth ""influences"" like The Beatles, Bob Seger, Sir Elton John, The Rolling Stones. Please... DA! These are talented musicians. Garth is a well-crafted businessman who has taken from these artists - not by mistake. He's better at holding a guitar than playing it. He's turned country into a complete JOKE. That fact is only proven on this Chris Gaines cd."
1,cynical rubbish,"This album is a shockingly cynical attempt by Garth Brooks to expand his musical boundaries without having to risk losing his country music base. The whole Chris Gaines image - as epitomized by the VH1 ""Behind The Music"" special - trivializes the sacrifices and difficulties of real people with real lives, as typified by his ""father"" dying of cancer, the death of a (fictional) best friend, etcetera. This isn't Hollywood escapism of the sort you might see in a movie, but a rather disgusting ego trip for Garth Brooks. As far as the music itself, if you think Richard Marx is one of the great musicians of the last 30 years, you will love this album. I didn't and don't."
1,Disappointed Garth Fan,"I bought the cd to add to my Garth collection. I regret not listening to it first. I was very disappointed to say the least. My husband told me not to buy it and I should've listened. We listened to the cd driving to our vacation destination. We couldn't stand it! It was more enjoyable to listen to static on a radio station. Garth needs to stick to country because he IS great at it. He needs to leave pop, or whatever you would call this, alone forever! I hated this cd and wish I would've saved my money!"
1,babyface meets prince not on this mess,"garth brooks is a great business man period.right along with puffy,mariah,celine dion,michael bolten. now as far as music he has always been way overrated and this disc proves that point further.trying to look like prince and sound like babyface? i don't think so.if he had come out like this 10 years back they would have had what ever happen to garth on vh1 back in 94? cuz that style played out along time ago not to mention the music that he is trying to hustle over onto to people."
1,I thought garth was real..but now I know the truth he isfake,Garth. THis album is a total disgrace.NOt one song stands out as even being semi decent. GO back to country or leave music alltogether
3,Not Entirely Entertaining,"Amazon readers, You know, I was excited when this compact disc hit the racks, because I have never seen Garth Brooks as anything but country. He did try to make it a success, but I only really enjoyed one song on the whole album. They are all mediocre, but ""It Don't Matter To The Sun"" is a sure hit, and a loving embrace to his new character, Chris Gaines."
2,not impressed,I DONT' KNOW WHAT GARTH THINKS' HE'S DOING TRYING TO GET INTO POP. IT IS NOT HIS TYPE OF MUSIC AND DOESN'T SOUND PARTICULARLY WELL.
4,Pleasant surprise,"Very good work with outstanding lyrics and a wide range of styles. It's taken a lot of flak from die-hard Brooks fans who feel he's turned his back on Country, and taken even more from non-Country critics who already had their low opinions of Garth Brooks fixed before even listening to the album. Give it a shot. It beats most of the all-sounds-the-same shlock on the radio today."
5,artist bucks country genre saddle,"What a great effort by Mr Brooks and Producer Don Was. It is a great showcase of vocal and arrangement/ production talent which I'm certain will have the country bumpkins totally confused. This is the first ""Garth"" album I have purchased having found the country rut a bit too derivative. Mr Brooks shows that he must have enough money and personal confidence to stretch out of his cliche for this fine musical effort."
3,SURPRISING,"I am not a Garth fan, nor have I ever heard his music until now (I was curious). I always thought of his music as old folks stuff or for the the Wal-Mart crowd, but with this effort my opinion might change. This album proves that Garth is a true artist/musician as he gets his groove on! But besides that, there is not much here! I mean does he really think he can compete with the blue eyed soul of the Backstreet Boys or NSYNC? Besides, my teenaged sister says she has never even heard of Garth Brooks? Mr. Brooks will have to do alot more if he really wants to enter this market!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,who cares what genre it is...it's garth and it's wonderful,"I watched the special and I have bought the album. No matter what he sings, Garth is the man and the music is as always wonderful. Who can tell me that they wish to do other things in life, but are too scared to do them? Garth is just doing them and we all know how he likes to do what he wants to do. I will play this album over and over.....will probably buy two because I will wear the first one out."
2,Chris Gaines' music - contrived and unoriginal!,"After listening to the cd several times I could not put my finger on exactly how to describe the songs. Almost immediately it is apparent that practically every song reminds you of another song that you've heard before. But there was more. Suddenly it hit me - these songs are ""constructed"" and contrived to sound modern and ""hip."" They sound a lot like songs you might hear on television shows during night club scenes. So overall the feel is a not quite real sensation.His attempt at social relevance with Get Together does not come off as he probably was hoping, and it actually left me wishing he'd just gone straight ahead and covered the classic tune instead of using it the way he did.Compared to a lot of the other offerings out there - this album falls flat and leaves me confused."
3,Give the guy a break! He did a good job!,"I liked the album because it shows that Garth Brooks is not afraid to act out his fantasies and show that there's more to life than country music. I give him a lot of credit for this work and I'm pleased with it. I've been a fan for a long time and while this isn't the best stuff he's ever done, I would still rate it pretty high. He's awesome!"
2,Garth Brooks doesn't have the raw musical emotion.,"The music of the great rock bands of the past drip with musical emotion--Plant's voice and Page's rythums, Clapton's soles, the piongancy of the Who and Beatles, or the wild bad boy images of the Stones and Aerosmith ferrmenting in their music. Garth doesn't. In fact, Garth doesn't even have such qualities as bad rock stars of today like Smash Mouth. Why, because if not in chronology, atleast in a sense of maturity, Garth is to old for rock and roll. Yes, Steve Tyler is near fifty. Mic and Keith have the angel of death cirlcing over their heads. But they are still young and wild in spirit--a spirit that comes thru on stage and in recordig seesions. Garth's music is not raw and somehow ""youthful""; it's not rock and roll. Some may say rock and roll si bad music. Well, I don't think so but maybe; it doesn't matter. Garth has as failed in an attempt to play not good or bad music but rock and roll."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"You have GOT to be kidding me--a fictional rock star's fictional ""greatest hits"" album? This album would be funny if it weren't so serious. Let Garth have his psychotic identity crisis without us. Save your money--this CD is worthless."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I am not a real fan of country music. However, who could miss the name Garth Brooks or be aware of his success? Consequently, I was intrigued by this CD, althought it seemed gimmicky. However, after hearing a few of the songs on a TV special, I was hooked. I love the CD. You have to admire the man. He takes a big risk with this CD, but proves that his talent is not restricted to Country music. I hope that we will see more of Chris Gaines. He has given all of us a chance to appreciate his many talents."
4,great music,"I really like this CD.The song ""It Don't Matter to the Sun"" is really good. The CD also grows on you. The first time I heard it I did not care for a couple of the songs but the more I listened the more I liked all the songs."
2,disappointed,"the stylus is awesome- red, black pens, stylus, and pencil. Since I use three of those all day, it is great.The screen protectors are fineThe little cleaner wipes are not necessaryThe case is NOT universal and is completely useless as it does not fit a naked Ipaq."
1,Case is useless for a nacked iPAC,"I was very disappointed with the carying case. First, a nacked iPAC just rattles around inside. It might be ok if you have an adaptor attached but I don't know because I don't have one. The belt loop is a joke as it isn't large enough to fit a normal belt even though the case itself is virtually empty with a nacked iPAC. The pen is nifty, but I don't personally need a pencil, black ink, and red ink ... only thing I've used is the stylus and the one on the iPAC is more convenient. So, the only thing in this pack that I will use is the screen protectors which should cost a lot less than this package."
4,Late Night Mushroom Pillow,"If there was ever an American answer to the Rolling Stones, I would have to say it was a band from Los Altos, California called the Chocolate Watchband.With their hard-hitting, bass and beat driven garage rock, you would swear you were listening to the Stones if you didn't know any better. There were even times when the Chocolate Watchband were seemingly calling out the Stones at their own game as far as raw urgent heaviness and angsty rock attitude.No Way Out is the Chocolate Watchband's debut album released at the tail end of the Summer of Love. In between psychedelic instrumentals and studio experimentation (put there by their engineer and producer as filler) are cuts of white hot garage punk that no doubt influenced the Ramones and L.A. punk bands like the Berlin Brats ten years later.Even the trippy stuff is pretty good on this album. Creepy at times, Aguilar seems to whisper behind a fog of LSD. It is one hazy, rhythm and blues-based psychedelic punk album."
4,Best Forgotten 60s Band,"The Chocolate Watchband...what can you say? Kindof a psychedelic/garage band fusion with a little 60s soul music thrown in--nice! The band's range is amazing and the rawness of the recordings keeps it fresh and fun despite the dark undertone of 60s nihlistic angst which can be felt somewhere in the background (try to ignore it). Frankly I just dicovered this album on Amazon so I haven't heard all the songs here, but ""Let's Talk About Girls"" (a minor hit for them), ""Expo 2000,"" ""No Way Out,"" and ""Are You Gonna Be There"" I have on a vinyl collection. Their album The Inner Mistique (which I have heard all of), is also now available on Amazon and is beautiful and quite different from this album."
5,Easy to follow,I was able to work really well with Jenna and follow her choreography. I liked the step by step breakdown and practice.
3,FOR ADVANCED ONLY,"IM A BEGINNER. I GOT THIS DVD HOPING FOR INSTRUCTION ON SHIMMYS WITH UPPER BODY MOVEMENTS. THEY ARE ON HERE, BUT NOT BROKEN DOWN ENOUGH FOR ME. JENNAS INSTRUCTION IS NICE AND WITH THE MIRRORS AND HER BODY PLACEMENT YOU CAN SEE WHAT SHE IS DOING. BUT I CAN NOT FOLLOW IT. I WILL SAVE IT FOR WHEN I HAVE ADVANCED MORE IN THIS ART FORM."
4,New perspective,"While I don't believe this is necessary for every belly dancers collection, it offers new perspective on how to layer moves. Some of the moves look alluring, while others are on the awkward side. This DVD can be very frustrating and hard in the beginning if you don't have the patience. Jenna has plenty to offer someone looking for more complex moves. I recommend taking what you want out of it, leave the rest."
4,Pretty Pink Flowers,I liked the pretty pink flowers in this piece but the bird's nest and one of the adult birds got lost on the branch when I finished! The plain background was not stiff and puckered easily. At least this one gave me good practice...
1,These are a joke! Don't waste your money.,"I tried these out today - they are horrible! First of all, they are a pain to put on. I went through 3 of the 12 just to get one on ""correctly."" Then, after I got in on, my Visor screen was converted into a bubble farm. There were bubbles everywhere that were impossible to smooth out. This product is a hollow chocolate bunny - it looks tasty, but then you find out it's empty. Take my advice - either take great care of your screen in the first place, or find a better product than this."
4,Modern Rock-A-Billy,"Steve Earle's Continetial Trailways Blues makes this album, a great cut and a great song by Steve. This is a nice album to add to your Rock-A-Billy collection.The Mean Eyed CatKNON 89.3 Dallas, Texas"
5,dance,BRAVO! This is a feel good C.D. I really enjoy his music. He out did his self with Together Again.It makes you want to dance and have a good time.
3,DK is a fantastic sax player no doubt.....,"I was disappointed in this long awaited musical re-debut...it just wasn't very energetic or ""new"" sounding as pumped up to be. Sounds no different than DK's other stuff which surprised me.... it is still good listening music, but not what I expected."
3,A step backwards,"Dave Koz found his sound with ""Lucky Man"" and reached his peak with ""Off The Beaten Path."" ""The Dance"" is a dramatic step backward. It lacks the energy, creativity, and virtuosity that made ""Off The Beaten Path"" my favorite disc. It's not as bad as his first disc, but it is definitely a collection of elevator music.If you want to hear the essence of Dave Koz, buy ""Off The Beaten Path,"" or better yet, buy the video of his Trinidad performance and see one of the premier live performers in action."
5,Fresh Musical Exuberance,"Dave Koz has a way with a saxophone like Shakespeare had a way with words. He fluidly exhorts emotions with every bar, smoooooth.""Together Again"" is a great way to start the day, ""Love Is On The Way"" is a great 5 p.m. tune. ""Know your Heart"" warms your emotions on a frosty evening. Goes well with a sip of sherry.If you are looking for a beautiful collection of jazz sax tunes to brighten your day, look no further; Dave will not disappoint you!"
5,Kenny G it's not,"I caught Dave at a smooth jazz holiday concert where he played several tracks from this release and I was taken by the sheer joy of the songs. He collaborates with some top talent, like Chris Botti, David Benoit, and Burt Bacharach, and it combines to make a wonderfully fulfilling record. Instead of the typical soprano sax whining, Dave shows his wizardry by making every song have its own feel and personality. ""Together Again"" is a great leadoff, but the rest of the record is even better. ""Playing by Heart"" (with Benoit) is touching, and BeBe Winans makes great work of the Garth Brooks tune ""The Dance"" All in all, Koz's best and a must have for any smooth jazz fan."
5,Dave Koz sets the right moves with THE DANCE,"This is by far one of the best jazz CD that I have had the opportunity to listen to. Dave starts off with ""Together Again"", then throws a little Luther Vandross at you with ""Can't Let Go"" followed shortly by ""Know You by Heart"". Although Garth Brooks is know for the song ""THE DANCE"", BeBe Winans rendition will move you to tears. The album has very few low parts making the transition from song to song seamless. A definite gift for every music lover, not just jazz aficionados."
1,"boring ""smooth"" jazz","I couldn't believe how bad this disc was, particularly given all of the 5-star reviews here. Perhaps the ""smooth jazz"" genre just isn't my favorite, but I do find that I like some of it. This album, however, is just uninspired. Other than Dave Koz's sax, it seems like the only musical instrument is a synthesizer. Yes, this cd sounds that cheesy. You might as well listen to Muzak.I suppose listening to this cd all the way through would be less painful than getting a lobotomy. That's about the only positive thing I can think to say about it."
4,Full of Fun and Delight,"There is a diversity of music and artists on this CD that shows how well rounded Dave really is. I really like ""Together Again"". It's one of those songs you want to hear early in the morning. I find it to be very uplifting and a pleasure to listen to. Dave found just the right artists to help make this CD a success."
5,Koz Rocks the House with his Newest CD,"Man, Dave Koz is just wonderful. I love this CD, there is so much energy and ""feel-good"" rhythm to it that it becomes addicting! I love just plopping the CD into my stereo at work and getting things accomplished with his music at my desk! This CD is wonderfully put together and the music Koz puts out is outstanding! I wish I had known more about his music sooner as compared to the recent success that Kenny G has, I hope Dave Koz is destined for the same fame if not more! If you want great feel good music with a terrrific upbeat melody...this is that CD, and I don't have a huge collection of instrumental/classical in my CD collection either!"
3,What a mix!,"I LOVED all the songs on this cd that were just instrumental, and couldn't stand the songs that had vocals in them. I bought the cd because I mistakenly thought that ""I'll be There"" was an instrumental version of the song I'd heard a few years back on the radio and absolutely loved. I was so disappointed when they burst into song! Same with ""Careless Whisper"", and all the other tracks that had shalla lala and other vocal interjections/singing on the songs. I think they take away from the wonderful instrumentals when artists do this. The sax playing is great tho!"
4,"I wanna Dance, but I hate whispering....","I purchased the DVD/DTS version of ""The Dance"". This is a must have for people with home theater setups who love some great jazz music.PROS: The music is fabulous (except for one), the surround sound mix is entertaining but not distracting, the menus are straightforward, the video picture is superb, and it includes some great people like BeBe and Burt.CONS: Why did he have to go there with the WHAM song? It was bad then and it still sounds bad now (not the sax playing, just the tune). The video that comes with it did not give it anymore entertainment value (in fact, it's on the cheesy side)."
2,Would be a winner if the scoring wasn't broken...,"2 Stars for presentation. These games have a dazzling game-show feel. With great sounds, lights and cool introductions..the games even ""unfold"" from their compact state dramatically.The problem with this and all the other ""Platinum Edition"" games is that whichever team gets past the target score first wins instantly.This means that statistically, Team 1 (or Team A) will always win.For example, let's say the target score is 50 points. And Team A has 45 and Team B has 48. We are now on turn 8 and Team A is up. Team A plays their turn and get to 55 points and are declared the winners. But what about team B? Why don't they get an 8th turn? Not really fair, is it?This leaves us with cool electronic versions of our classic games with broken scoring systems where whoever goes first is most likely to win.Why they didn't catch this ""bug"" in QA, I have no idea.Good try Hasbro, but you certainly dropped the ball on these games."
2,Unforgettable,"Because I hated it. No, that's not true. I liked the hero a lot, the concept was interesting, but the heroine was awful. Imagine the rudest, most ethno-centric, wilfully ignorant cultural snob you can - and you know this chick. Her arrogant refusal to respect the traditions of the country where she was working made her completely unappealing & dislikable. And the chip on her shoulder was so heavy I could hardly lift my kindle.Two stars instead of one only because of the hero & concept. Definitely not recommended."
2,What a surprise!,"Oh my gosh! I have not been this disappointed in a harlequin presents book in such a long time!I guess my expectations must have been quite high either because of the reviews I read here or because it was written by Sandra Marton. I thought this was a painful read and didn't even ring true to my ears. I kept skipping the pages because I was so bored while reading it. I will try another of Sandra Marton's and hope it wipes this off.The beginning was very promising and I couldn't wait to read it all. I thought it lost focus, I didn't really feel like the characters, Sheikh Quasim and his wife, truly loved each other. I also did not enjoy their chemistry :(In short, I am not recommending this book."
2,Blechh,"There is almost no overarching storyline in this book making it just a collection of random chapters. Most of the chapters star a different set of characters than the previous one. This makes for a relatively dull read.Also, most of the history in this book is sub-par to that in the previous books in the series."
1,"Idea is good, but...","Got the pack for my HP Jornada 548. It is basically a peel-and-stick film. Firstly, its size is less than Jornada's screen - about 1 to 1.5 mm on each side. Secondly, the film has some sticky residue that was left on the screen after I removed it. I like the idea of a sticker as opposed to original HP's ""clip-ins,"" but it could be worked better. When returned to Amazon, I was warned I'd be charged return shipping costs because ""item did not fit my equipment"" was my fault (!??). Not a biggie, but description could be clearer to avoid similar experiences. Again, my experience applies to Jornada 520/540 series PDAs."
2,you get what you pay for,waited the max time for arrival then when it finnally when it got here they are cheap plastic junk they don't even stay on the lights the little chili peppers fall off just don't expect nice actual colored bulbs ... they are cheap clear christmas lights with plastic chili peppers that slip over the bulbs i probably wouldn't be so dissapointed if they at least stayed on the little plastic chili peppers just fall off very easily
4,Decorate with light,"The chili lights are a little larger than I expected, but provide a warm accent to our kitchen area. The color of each light is red to yellow as shown in the photo, nice glow. I would get these again."
3,Encyclopedia of technique but . . .,"This DVD is an encyclopedia of veil technique. The moves are broken down well into understandable chunks and the sequencing is quite good, well-thought out and organized. But . . .a major problem is the presenter's babbling. About every 30 seconds she says something incoherent and obnoxious if you really listen. She needs a dialog coach or an old-fashioned English teacher to correct things like, ""There is many variations, here is a few."" She sounds like a grammatically-challenged hillbilly. Unfortunately the DVD doesn't work without the sound and it is distracting to hear the string of bloopers, you wince and feel like turning it off or throwing something at the TV monitor.To conclude, if you can ignore the obnoxious bits, buy this DVD for the technique value."
5,WOW!,"This is the best money I have ever spent on an instructional DVD, and the first time I have been compelled to write a review. I teach belly dance and am always looking for new, fresh ideas. Sarah covers more moves, with more variations than in any other DVD I've bought. They usually offer the same old moves, and I feel I've wasted my money. Sarah offers way more content than what is typical for these instructional DVDs. With this one, not only did I see some moves I never had before, but she shows and breaks down several moves I've never seen outside of a studio situation. She also offers some different variations on some common moves. All of her instruction is clear and easy to follow, but she doesn't spend a huge amount of time on one thing, to the point where you get bored. I only wish that she had a dozen or so videos available! Sarah is a lovely dancer, and if you like to dance with a veil, this is a fantastic addition to any one's dance repertoire."
5,Belly Dance with Veil by Sarah Skinner,"Just loved this one! I was looking for veil instruction and Sarah came through beautifully. The DVD was well written, well presented and well rehearsed. Sarah covers veil materials (very important for movement) moves slowly through the combos, thoroughly explains them while breaking them down then sets them to music so you get the idea of how the combo flows in a choreography. She also puts all of the combos into a dance at the end so you can see how everything works. This one is a keeper and I would recommend it to anyone looking for veil instruction."
4,Like this a lot!,"Okay, so I first heard of Phil Wickham when I went to a David Crowder concert. He is an amazing vocalist. He played on only his acoustic guitar and sang- no band. He was simply amazing. His heart to worship is awesome and I really felt that at the worship concert. I love the lyrics to his songs because of how he worships the Lord. Yes- something that is creative, sounds like a person that knows music and loves the Lord! I actually like this CD better than the Cannons although there are songs on Cannons I like, some of the background music I think is too much. I prefer him and his guitar, some drums . . . I think less is more really does him well. Although on this album I think he has a similar sound to Coldplay on some songs. This album is great!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Album,"This album is great. Excellent music and lyrics; very contemporary Christian music. Wickham's voice reminds me at times of Bono of U2, and then also of Freddie Mercury at times. Beautiful relic!"
4,Solid Debut Release,"Phil Wickham first became known to me for being the ""free song of the week"" download on iTunes with his song ""Grace"". Now hearing the rest of the album I can truly say that Phil Wickham is here to stay! This is a very good album!Phil's sound is a mixture of Coldplay, a tiny bit of folk, acoustic rock, and some Jason Morant. His voice to me actually sounds very similar to Jason Morant as well as alot of the stylings and lyrics of his worship songs. Phil does add enough of his own sound to make him stand out and should make him many fans.All in all Phil Wickham puts together a solid release of worship songs without sounding like every other worship album. If you are looking for something truly unique with a great acoustic rock sound then check out Phil Wickham and enjoy the musical journey he takes you on."
4,Could be better,"Good CD overall, but not quite as good as his last release (i may be a little too critical, however, because i absolutely love his other CD)."
2,cd,I love the music from Phil Wickam but the CD I received from Amazon is a bit scratched. The first two songs skip over certain parts. I did not want the hassle of sending it back for a differant copy.
2,Nice clock but..,"When the battery gets low, the alarm quits working and you have to know to change the battery. Perhaps a 200 pound person could stand on the clock without damaging it but, on my clock, the little circular handle for setting the alarm fell off. Now, in effect, the alarm doesn't work."
1,Poor quality product,"I own one. It keeps time but the alarm stopped working. I sent it back to Victorinox who repaired for the cost of $40 plus shipping. It worked for a while and then the alarm stopped working again. I've given up and just use it as a timer without alarm. Frankly, I thought that the Swiss Army name signified better quality. I'm sorry to report that at least with this product, it hasn't been my experience. If I were to buy another travel clock I'd stay away from this product. I could not recommend it based on my experience.Barry"
5,Perfect for candy!,This is the BEST blueberry flavoring you can buy. We use it in our fudge and mix 1 part of LorAnn's Blueberry Flavoring with 1 part LorAnn's Cheesecake flavoring for a delicious mix. It is actually one of our best selling flavors!
4,good stuff!,"I only gave 4 stars because the bottle needs a little dropper or an easier way to dispense the flavoring.This is delicious blueberry flavoring.in a very a TINY bottle !! This was my first purchase of blueberry flavor - I wanted it to add to my coffee filter for coffee in the morning. I will try different kinds, but so far I do like this product."
1,WORST PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE,I ordered this because my new baby is DISABLED and she only likes blueberry so since she has horrible food allergies I decided I wanted to make her a blueberry cake. I bought three just so I had the flavor on hand. ITS HORRIBLE! It tastes worst than nyquil and the company will NOT return my unopened or my opened product. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. Their product description is wrong and the customer service is worse than walmart
3,Princess Duare is no Dejah Thoris,"While Burroughs remains a craftsman of science fiction, the Venus series never contained that special spark that the Mars books had. This book was originally published as four novelettes in pulp magazines, and while that's not really strange, in this case the set up for each was so similar that it really shows.Begin with the Mars books. Read these if you're a die-hard fan."
2,Dont buy this,This has to be the worst printer I ever bought.1) Returned 2 printer cartridges because they were flawed2) Downloading application list takes forever and scanning is a total joke3) Ink runs out way too fast. I swear I printed less than 100 copies of mostly black and white. This printer's ink level indicators drop fast. How the heck my color ink levels drop is beyond me.4) Wireless is a pain in the rear. I am sitting here right now trying to get the wireless up and running again and it doesn't recognize my wireless network.5) lxdiag and utilities crash my Windows XP SP3 system. I had to reinstall twice.Summary:Stay away from this thing. Its a POS that I will someday sledge hammer into little bits and pieces.
1,Ripp Off Rip Off chip in ctg prevents refill,Lexmark has a chip in their ink cartridges that meters the amount of ink used. You can't refill the cartridge without resetting the chip!!!In other words you have to buy their over priced ink. The ink cartridges are where they make billions of dollar in profit. I printed a few leases out with a full cartridge and it ran out of ink in no time. This is a complete rip off !!
2,Wireless Scanning is a joke,I have owned this printer for over a year now and while the copy feature is nice and the wireless printing typically works like a charm I have recently started my own business and now require frequent scans of which I have two issues. The Lexmark Printer will see my laptop and allow me to send scanned images to it but not my desktop aka (Work computer) and it lacks the ability to convert its scans to PDF's. Since the process involved to get the scanning functionality I require has become so laborious I have to give this little all-in-one 2 stars.
2,Not a fan - don't recommend,"Owned for 3 years - paper feeder finally broke. Here's a summation:Wireless:- Setting up on my WiFi with iMac was always painful. I never got a handle on how to do it properly.- If something happened to WiFi, i.e. it went down, I had to re-setup the wireless (time consuming and frustrating)Scanner:- Wireless scanning created 2+MB files, even for text only. Only way to get smaller was to hookup USB.Printing/Copying:- Decent quality color and black/white.- Difficult menu to print only black/white if using wirelessOverall, I recommend finding something else. I just bought a Canon Pixma 5320 and so far it is night & day better than the Lexmark 4550."
2,Save your money for something better! So frustrating.,"Its a printer. Don't expect to be able to scan! We have moved a couple of times, and every time we have to reconnect our printer to the wireless network, it takes days!!It only connects when it wants to. We keep it directly above the computer!! WE have to re-connect the installation cord constantly!And scanning, forget it. It searches applications for several minutes only to say ""application list failed"". Never been able to scan w/ it once. I tried a memory card, it said ""device locked"" the device was most certainly not locked. I checked it, unlocked it, and reinserted. Same message. Different memory card, same issue.If you want to print things, great. Anything else, its a waste of money and a time sucker to continuously re-connect."
1,Keep Looking,"I originally got this because it was inexpensive and the wireless concept appealed to me. The initial setup went fint, but it was a nightmare installing on multiple computers.It also had problems connecting to my router. Even though they were about 3 feet apart, the printer would still often fail to recognize my network.And if you like printing in the background, forget it. The software suite pops up to tell you that you are printing. Then it pops up and tells you you are done printing. Can't it just print and let me continue working?Copying is fine but scanning is not. Whenever I tried to scan a document in as a '.pdf' file, it would hang up and finally tell me to pick another format. I usually ended up scanning documents as pictures and inserting them into my documents."
5,Great product,"My old printer went out because I purchased an off brand ink cartridge, so I was looking for a replacement, but needed a copier and scanner. This product so far has been great, easy to set up and use. It fits nicely on my bookshelf next to my desk. Looks great, prints and copies well. So far, my ink level has not dropped as quickly as my old printer, and the cost of the replacement ink is resonable. Thanks again, AMAZON!3/19/10-I have had this now for almost a year and it is still running great. The only problem I have had is the paper sometimes does not load right and you have to reposition it. I used the scan to email feature the other day and it worked great, even for an oldster like me. I still remember the days of the portable typewriters and hand cranked adding machines!"
2,Unfortunate Problem,"Lexmark X4550 Wireless All-in-One Photo Printing/Scan/Copy/Print (1410600)I had this printer for about 2 weeks. Hook-up was easy, and everything worked great. Unfortunately, the printer started to power itself off after about 20 minutes of not being used. This was very annoying. It is supposed to go into a sleep mode, which is what it had been doing at first.I called Lexmark's support number and someone on their staff talked me through several troubleshooting steps. After trying 4 or 5 different things he finally told me that I must have a defective product. Luckily, Lexmark was able to upgrade the printer for free. They sent me a new (and better) printer, and I sent them the old broken one back.In the end everything worked out fine, but it was still a lot of hassle. I'm sure that not every printer has the glitch that mine did, but if you purchase this printer and it doesn't work well be sure to call Lexmark right away. Their staff was very friendly and helpful."
5,Solid printer,"I am impressed with the quality for the price we paid. When I had to call customer service, they were very helpful"
4,product info is misleading,"X4550 does not come with automatic document feeder, and it does not have fax function. Wireless printing is easy to set up by installation program on CD."
4,Works as advertised,"This printer certainly works as advertised. My only complaint is that when it has to communicate through too many walls, it slows it down so much it times out. Maybe I am asking too much of the technology."
4,Excellent product,I bought this printer for my college student for Christmas. Installation was so simple! So far all seems to be good and easy to use.For the price and functionality I would recommend this product.
1,Not worth it,"I was so excited to get this printer. I set it up easy peasy on my desktop and laptop, never did get to see how it prints though, every time I tried to print the paper jammed, I cleaned the rollers at the suggestion of customer service and still didn't work. I tried all different kinds of paper, nothing worked. After spending about 6 hours in all trying to get this printer to do it's job, I sent it back."
1,Lexmark printers aren't economic,"If you want to waste money buying ink cartridges every week, then go ahead and buy a Lexmark... !!! I have an all-in-one Lexmark that decided to stop reading the ink cartridges!! The ink cost 25 dollars for each cartridge, which doesn't last very long at all! This printer is a real money hog if you plan to actually use it to print. I warn you to get a printer that doesn't sell its ink all in one cartridge.. Better to have two cartridges... one color and one black. I would never take a Lexmark again even if it is for free!!!"
4,Great 3 in 1 Printer,"I've always had great luck with Lexmark printers, I won't buy anything else. This 3 in 1 printer was just to pass up...very happy with the purchase.Steve. B"
1,Last page only,"The title says it all...his printer will only print the last page of a document...this is a terrible machine and the tech support is even worse...for over 3 hours they couldn't figure it out and now they arent answering my emails...keep the 70 bucks lexmark, thats the last money you will get from me...t this point its not even worth te stress of dealing with them...back to HP for me..."
3,"Ink ""eater""",A great machine but have some back-up black ink cartridges available. It's posible the machine is new and the radio of ink vs.number of copies will get better but I'm not holding my breath.
2,Broke after a year,This printer was great a first but then had issues connecting with my computer via wireless network and then eventually it would get constant paper jams and would not print. I could not fix it and it would make awful sounds so I tossed it. I think one can find something better now because this item was purchased awhile ago.
4,how I feel,"The printer is good for printing and copying.but the program that comes with it could be better, like the one that came with the Lexmark X75 printer.the fax only works with the computer on.the WIFI has a problem with running on computer not on the hub."
1,Kinda Cheap,"First one broke the very first day. replaced for free, second one jams up alot. poor paper handler...wifi is cool tho."
5,love it,"i LOVE this printer. most of my printing is black and white, maybe its because im not used to newers ones but it spits black white copies really fast.the color that came with it didn't last long. only a few full print pages.high yield is recomended for both cartridges"
1,"cheap, but expensive","The printer is cheap, but the ink is not!!! Because of the memory in this printer, you cannot refill cartridges (either by the professionals or yourself). The printer can recognize when a cartridge is empty and will not allow you to use it again-ever!!! The print quality is good, but I'm not writing a novel and only use it for kids stuff and printing info online. I will be shopping for a new printer that will allow me to refill the ink."
3,Solid Printer but not impressed with the wifi,"The print quality is great the speed is fine for my needs, but the WiFi doesn't work very well. Everytime I start a new project I have to reinstall to get it to work. If I plug in with the wires it works great but it hasn't lived up to my hopes."
2,Ink cartridges don't last very long at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"we purchased this printer because of its wireless capabilities but could not get it to work right (my husband has never run into anything he couldn't figure out until this). so we settled for hooking it directly to our desktop computer and just plugged it into our laptop when we needed to print from that. kind of a pain... but oh well, we got used to it.i also had issues with the paper jamming frequently as other people have commented on.the biggest pain for me.... i was horrified at how often i've had to replace the ink compared to our previous printer (an old HP all-in-one). and i don't do a lot of printing either... so after less than a year this lexmark is being replaced... back to a new HP. :0)"
2,Not compatible with Mac -- Apple software conflicts,"This printer is advertised as Mac-compatible, but it is not. Apple software (including Safari and Viewer) crashes instantly when I attempt to print from that software. The software ""closes unexpectedly,"" and the document does not print. This does not happen with Microsoft Office software on a Mac. It also does not happen on a Windows PC running XP.I conclude that the printer simply can't be used with Apple software, which makes it useless for Mac users.Update: I replaced this printer with an HP OfficeJet wireless all-in-one. The HP works flawlessly with the Mac, and connects to my wireless network with a single click. I recommend choosing HP over Lexmark."
2,More headache then it's worth,"After days on the phone with the Indian technicians the unit never got to function wirelessly. It only holds about 20 sheets of paper and the feed mechanism is poor. After a few months of use I got a paper jam and realized that there is no way to get to the crumpled paper inside the machine. The customer service agent advised that I turn over the machine and vigorously shake it for 20 seconds. While the sheet didn't dislodge, it did stick out a bit from the rollers and with great difficulty I managed to rip it out piece by piece. Now I still get the paper jam notice and I'm just going to throw this unit out. One more thing, the ink for this unit was really expensive. These companies don't make much on the machine but on the replacement ink cartridges. I'm going to pick up the highly rated Brother MFC-490CW at a local Office Depot or Staples for $129 and have the ability to easily take it back if it doesn't work."
1,boo! worst printer I've owned,"Its a great Idea, but it never works. We have a small apt. and it always says ""problem communicating with the printer"" the usb cord fails as well. So its large, heavy, useless... but i sure wish they would let me send it in for something comparable that works. I would have given it zero stars, if that was an option."
1,TERRIBLE IM NOT KIDDING DONT BUY!!,This is the worst printer ever!!! doesnt work with mac and the box says it does doesnt work with pc and always has problems communicating with the printer thats with the wireless but if you use it for a wired connection it works ok which is why i do that and then share it using apples bonour server
1,very bad,I paid so much for this product for the printer to eat paper. I was so disapointed with the packaging. If I knew what I have learned all these year about returning product and what could have been done it would not be in storage wandering what to do with itLexmark X4550 Wireless All-in-One Photo Printing/Scan/Copy/Print (1410600)
4,So far so good.,"After some initial problems with my install of the software on Windows Vista, I called support to figure out the problem. The tech support guy was able to remotely enter my computer and reinstall the software while also tweaking the print spooler utility which got the printer up and running. After that point, I have been happy with the capability and performance of the printing. For the price and wireless technology, not a bad deal."
2,a little misleading,"The printer is easy to set up and works great, BUT.. you cannot connect it by USB to your main PC and also use it as a wireless. It's either one or the other. You'll need a network and router if you physically connect to a PC, in oder to use multiple satellite PCs (laptops)."
4,"Full Featured, easy to use, Worth the price, High Ink Price","Got it for Home use, Setup was easy using the supplied CD. Printer startup is quick without any head cleaning or roller adjustments. Printing is Fast and Quiet. For the price it's a good device, I just hope Lexmark ink prices could be cheaper."
5,lexmark,i have used lexmark printers for years and found them to be quite reliable and compatible with both my desktop pc and my laptop.i had gotten this lexmark to replace a printer/scanner/copier(other brand name) that refused to work after 3 months. the other company refused to replace it after we had tested the power cord and printer with my laptop and even re - download the program disc.the lexmark printer/scanner/copier is absolutely great. it is hooked in both the laptop and desk pc. when i need to send a hardcopy of something for my husband to read -- i send the information to him by using the wi-fi feature of this printer. i have to make sure that whatever i need for myself goes to my printer. lol
3,"great wifi, disappointing pictures","I was thrilled at the ease of installing and using this printer. Its wifi component works very well, it's fairly quick, ink is affordable. However, today I printed my first pictures, and am VERY disappointed. I did not buy it to print photos, but with my old HP, I did this with great ease and great quality. The photo-editing software from Lexmark makes it very difficulty to see your photo while you edit, and isn't very easy to use. The pictures are very grainy. I am very disappointed."
1,Put money and time to better use elsewhere,"Printers should not be this difficult to set up and use. I've had Epsons, HPs, and Brothers. This particular Lexmark has to be the worst, by far, in regards to print quality, user manual and troubleshooting. Since it is too late to get my money back, I will try again to set it up and get it functioning correctly. Correctly meaning it works how I want, when I want. That's what it is supposed to do, right? (That's what my Brother all-in-one does, every time.) But for those wondering if this is the printer for them, buy something else. It's not worth it."
4,Telesteps Ladder,The Telesteps ladder performed as advertised. It was easy to erect and easy to stow. Users have to pay attention to the instructions to avoid pinching fingers when stowing the ladder. The instructions differed slightly from the features of the ladder but can be understood by a competent user. The ladder fits in my car trunk and meets my needs.
5,Great Ladder,"Light, strong and collapsible ladder for those who work in tight electrical closets and who travel from job to job in a compact car instead of a truck with a ladder rack. Couldn't do without it."
1,Nightmare experience,"They canceled my and (1000s of other orders) on the Eve of Valentine's Day because the price was wrong. Then, the kicker, I get (no lie) 597 emails from them notifying me of the cancellation. There IT department copied everyone on everyone else's order. So, I see everyones email address and order number; not to mention, it filled my email box quota so I couldn't get any other legit email. Our email server also got heavily taxed.After all that their response was, that if I order again, then send them an email, they will credit me shipping. Wow! a nice deal from them, regular price on the flowers, with free shipping.I buy a lot online and this was the worst experience of my online shopping life. Use a competitor company!"
2,Dead in Three Days,"They was so happy to receive this, then three days later they called to tell me they were dead. but started out very pretty thats why 1 more star"
4,Not bad,I bought these for my wife and i am very happy i did. She loved them and i could not have gotton better flowers from my local floral shop. You will be pleased with your purchase! Enjoy.
1,Late Delivery of Dead Flowers,"I sent this as a gift and it got there after one week and a half DEAD. I can not tell you how horrible I felt and Falcon Farms customer service did NOTHING tho remidy this, I paid ahead just like everyone else. I will NEVER buy here again."
1,dead on arival,my wife recived the roses the next day of the order in a box. the roses were dead and black. she thought i was mad at her. do not buy. i repeat... do not buy.
3,"Ordered two - one good, one poor","Ordered two separate 1-doz rose orders to be delivered to colorado pre-Mom's day. One recipient said they came out wonderful, the other said they were pretty poor quality. I guess you takes your chances..."
1,"Flowers arrived wilted, almost dead","Terrible experience. First, the flowers arrived several days late. And they were extremely wilted and pretty much dead the next day."
1,Dead Flowers,Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday. Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun. My father tried to contact them and nobody responded. I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund.I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist.
2,Fast service... crummy flowers,"As others have stated, they do arrive quickly and they are very fresh. However, the buds are reasonably small and the value is mediocre. You could stop at the local grocery and pick up the same quality roses for 9.99. I am frustrated by the overall quality of Costco roses... but who can beat two-dozen large bud roses for only 12.99.These roses also expired after about 4 days. Typically I can get a week out of delivered or grocery purchased roses.This isn't the value it seems. If you want credit for the thought and they aren't very discerning people, then go for it, otherwise save your money and call a local florist where you'll still get the best expensive bang for your buck."
1,Horrible,"Amazon messed up my order, then Falcon Farms fixed it, then Falcon Farms screwed it up again. It was supposed to be delivered on Valentines Day, but Falcon Farms made an error on the shipping label and therefore it was shipped back to Falcon Farms, here it is one day after valentines day and still flowerless. Horrible service, I will not order flowers from this store again."
1,"Bad, Bad and Worse",Ordered for Valentine and three days before they cancelled order after almost a week after charging credit card. This is a rip off company in my opinion.
1,Bad,The order was cancelled by the vendor. Payment was returned in multiple installments. Total confusion on vendors part.Over and above received 40+ emails from the vendor cancelling the order while keeping about 100+ other clients on copy who had ordered for the same.Was surprised to see such vendors qualify to work with Amazon and mess up it's reputation.
1,Unreliable Store,"They advertised an incredible special on a dozen roses for Valentine's day. I placed an order more than a week before the date. Two days before Valentine's Day I receive an email saying order is being refunded. They did refund me my money, but the amount the refunded me was incorrect the first time. They corrected this mistake so I got all my money back. But the left me in the lurch for Valentine's Day.I would not recommend using them."
5,Falcon Farms - Fabulous! Extraordinary Service!,"The most exceptional customer service I have ever experienced. I notified Falcon Farms of my order problem at 9:00 a.m. and they somehow managed to get out a replacement by 3:00 p.m. the same afternoon! The most friendly, fast, and astonishingly responsive service in the land! The ability to resolve an issue in such record-braking time demonstrates the high quality of this company! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I highly recommend!"
3,I was pleased,"They had a bit of freezer burn, and when delivered were upside down and smooshed, but otherwise were good. (I imagine better marking of ""this side up"" would have helped."
4,Fast shipping and nice flowers,I surprised a friend with these flowers. They arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo.Even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses. To bad that they are not shipping in Romania.Update: After 5 days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice. I am so glad that I could make someone happy with these very nice roses.
1,Avoid Falcon Farms At All Cost!,Avoid Falcon Farms! They do not deliver what they advertise. I ordered approximately one week ago and did not receive anything even remotely similar to what was pictured in the ad. I feel completely deceived. Avoid!
2,not clear,It is difficult to make out what it is and it fell over in the middle of wedding vows even after tryin to prop it really well.
4,L'il Critters Malty Vites,"I LOVE these vitamins. What's even better so does my 5 year old son. I have tried a lot of different vitamins & nothing seem to work but these. I have even tasted them. They really do taste like a malted milkball. The only problem I have, is that I can't seem to buy them at the GNC stores. So I buy them through Amazon.com The only thing that I wish that Amazon.com did when shipping this item is to place a ice pack inside the delivery box. When I got these in the mail the vitamins were melted a little."
1,fatal odor,"If you want to clear out a room, play this sludge at full volume. Lame rock star wannabes. Save your money and buy a hammer to beat yourself in the skull with. The pain will be far less than having to endure this abortion."
3,Somewhat Entertaining....,"Being a fan of comic book art, video games, and zombies, I figured this graphic novel would be a unique treat... but I have mixed feelings. The art in this book is very nice and interesting, especially in the action sequences. It remains faithful to the game, in that the characters randomly find weapons, ammunition, puzzle keys, and herbs... although this adds to the choppy storytelling. Overall, the story is bland and uninteresting, much of it being told through Claire's non-stop self exposition. If you're a huge fan of the game and comic book art, you will probably enjoy this graphic novel. But, if you are looking to be engaged in a great zombie story you should look elsewhere."
1,waste of money,Don't expect this book to give you a step by step. More of a picture book with what each cookie represents....waste of money!
2,Let me save you $12.21 today.,"This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection. I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets! There, you can continue shopping."
2,"Same book, different title","...Retire Young...., however, is a sleeper. Same ideas in a new wrapper. Mr. Kiyosaki has retired rich and continues to get richer on this fluffy tome. While the title is compelling, this achingly dull book takes over 300 pages to sell one idea. That idea is to expand your mind far enough to grasp the idea that one can retire young and rich.Great. Done. Now how do I do that exactly?Well, that's ""beyond the scope of this book"". Mr. Kiyosaki introduces the idea of options trading which is exciting and new to me but does not recomend where I can learn more about it. (Go to the library he says. Maybe a suggestion of an author or title?)Save your money. Buy it at a deep discount if you must. Or better yet. Go to the library."
1,Boring and too Conceptual,I just took this book out of the library today and plan on returning it as soon as possible. Robert Kiyosaki is rehashing what has been said for many years. It is too conceptual for my taste. I gave one star due to the fact that Kiyosaki was able to make a fortune of money by getting people to buy his books.Don't waste your time reading this book.
1,Waste of time,"This book could have been summarized on one sheet of paper. The author constantly repeats the same (obvious) points to fill up the pages. The ""rich dad poor dad"" theme was especially annoying. I was completely sick of both fathers after the 400th reference to both. There are a number of plugs in the book for other products the author is selling. I do not recommend for anyone who is looking for practical information."
5,"Take charge, own your life!","This book will open your eyes, make you think but most important motivate you to take charge of your life. There is one particular line that I remember especially, First identify what I am afraid of, then ask myself what I want instead, then ask myself how to get it. Invest in your freedom. Buy this book!Want to stat putting some action to theory? Start with these study edition books:Think And Grow Rich: The Personal Study EditionThe Master Key System: The Personal Study EditionPath To Prosperity - Mastery Of Destiny - Acres Of Diamonds: The Personal Study EditionThe Science of Getting Rich: The Movie - 2 Disk Set"
4,"Good Book, too many plugs","Mr. Kiyosaki's ideas and strategies can be used to help people diversify an investment portfolio. Generating alternative means of income is an important point he stresses. This book is an easy read with an upbeat pace. The motivation and dedication he lives is illustrated in the flow of the book. However, too many plugs for his other books and books of his friends are listed throughout the book."
3,"This Book is like a ""Power Bar""....","Not a lot of nutritous or fulfilling substance, but it does get you pumped up pretty good. I agree with other reviewers that the book is short on specifics. To be fair, however, Kiyosaki never claimed that this book would have a lot of specifics.On the up side, however, I felt very motivated after reading this book, and, came away with some general ideas.I can't help but wonder two things, however:1. Is this book simply written so vaguely that you make out of it what you will?2. Was ""Rich Dad"" omniscient and ominpresent? It's amazing how many fables, fairytales, bible stories and diagrams he seemed to teach for every occasion. Just a thought--you draw your own conclusion"
2,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad == Retire Young, Retire Rich","I loved Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and it definitely inspired my entire family, but I didn't get much out of RY,RR. It seems to be much of the same encouragement. I think one or the other would suffice. If you own Rich Dad, Poor Dad, just reread it."
3,People should work harder,"I haven't yet read the other books in the ""series""; but I can say that reading anything for the supposition that it may someday have relevance is not a bad thing. For all those crying poor-mouth about not finding work, get over yourselves and work at all the malls or fast-food joints that I see signs on. Better yet, work 2 jobs like I do and keep in mind that it's not forever. It's possible to retire young, you just have to WORK first."
1,Opinionated,"If you want general perspectives or approaches, do not buy this book.To sum it up - this book goads readers to cheat on taxes and invest to the hilt in real estate. This could be great unless real estate prices start going down and as the US government starts closing the loopholes for their so called ""passive income"".May be the tax laws in the US have enough loop holes but not sure if this is a general book for a world audience."
1,MONEY IS EVERYTHING!!,"ANOTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR WHO BELIEVES THAT BEING RICH IS WHAT LIFEIS ALL ABOUT.THIS BOOK IS LIKE HIS OTHERS IN WHICH IT EXPLAINS WHYHAVING MONEY AND THINGS MEANS BEING HAPPY. LOOK AT THE BACK COVEROF THE BOOK AND YOU WILL SEE A MAN WHO WANTS YOU TO KNOW THATHAVING MONEY MEANS LIVING A GRAND LIFE. MONEY IS NICE BUT IT'S NOTEVERYTHING THAT THIS AUTHOR WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE IT IS, IF YOUFOLLOW HIS PHILOSOPHY. IF YOU ARE EXTERNALLY MOTIVATED THEN THIS BOOKIS FOR YOU. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S INSIDE IS WHAT MATTERS THENSTAY AWAY FROM THIS."
3,Huh?,"something about the author complaining about being broke and worring about the next year while he was on a ski trip just doesn't sound right. The long and the short of this book is own a bunch of assets, go into debt to get them if you have too, then write a series of books.Some good information about changing your mindset, but I had already done that is why I bought the book."
1,This book is not detailed enough - too general,"This book is too general - it is not as detailed as I thought to be. I am quite disappointed in this book. Robert keep referring to his other books, leaving you hanging there and thinking - is he trying to sell me his other books? It seems like he wants to write a book that could tie in with his other books (in order to sell you his other books). I really think I made a bad choice in buying this book!"
5,Very good guide,"Wish I read it when I was 15! A very good and clear book on creating value in terms of assets and cashflow. Though much is said about properties, it can be applicable to many businesses or ventures of a passive income nature to work towards financial freedom."
1,Is this a book or a biography??????????? cmon robert,"I will start off with, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I heard alot about this gentleman and figured id read one of his books. I first thought, hmm , well maybe it will get more interesting as I read on. Well I read the book cover to cover and it was nothing more than him rambling on about how him and his wife made their millions but nothing about actually HOW TO DO IT! Yeah he had a couple good points (*note..a couple), I'll give him that. He needs to stop talking about himself and his ""rich dad"" and write about material people can actually use. Sorry Robert.........But ive found Russ Whitney!"
3,Get Rich Quickly?-Keep on dreaming!,"This book is definitely an easy, motivating but shallow read.A typical but unrealistic self-help book, I guess it is more likely to win the lottery than getting rich and stay rich with the advice of ""Rich Dad"".Nevertheless, bearing this in mind, recommendable for motivational purposes as it certainly will force you to shift your personal paradigm on financial matters."
1,This Book is Fiction,"I have been a reader of Kiyosaki for quite some time. Yet I've learned that this book is fiction. I have read in numerous places that there is no evidence whatsoever to substantiate any of Kiyosaki's past businesses or even the existence of a rich dad. He has refused to comment when questioned about it. I didn't believe it, until I took a look at the copyright page: Although based on a true story, certain events in the book have been fictionalized for educational content and impact."
3,"some good, some bad","I'm going to go right in the middle with 3 starsGood:- my mind has been opened to greater possibilities/contexts (ie i did find it empowering as i like the psychological angle)- for a financial ignoramous, i still learned a tiny bit (tho i was hoping for more)- encourages financial literacyBad:- horrible writer (if you're going to sell millions of books, at least make an effort to learn the diff between (or get editors who can) except and accept)- a bit patronizing- my understanding from others is that he may be completely wrong and hurtfully misleading to lots of people who don't know better"
4,Retire Young Retire Rich Audiobook CD,"I liked what Mr. Kiyosaki had to say and the information is great. I would call this an introduction to the Rich Dad, Poor Dad material since it seemed to me like the CDs ended just when the author was getting started. This audiobook ""scratches the surface."" When the third one ended I was definitely left wanting more!"
1,A Book of Words...Just WORDS!,"If ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" is a brilliant success, this one is a brilliant FAILURE. The theme is very loose, and it seems the author has nothing to say anymore, especially after all these rich dad, poor dad series. I cannot find the theme coherence of the whole book, and the author is just selling / marketing (again) all his previous titles. You can get any more practical financial advices from other Do-it-yourself personal finance book. I just want to say: if you want to be the rich dad, don't buy the book and save the money in money market fund, at least you earn a penny a month."
2,"Few specifics, lots of repetition","This book is okay. Mostly it encourages you to get your mind ready for being rich rather than just assuming that you never will be. Unfortunately, it spends the first 200 or so pages doing that. Eventually, it gives cursory treatments of real estate investing, stock options, and building businesses. Unfortunately, it never tells you *how* to do anything.If you are hoping to educate yourself on how to make a plan for retiring young and rich, do not buy this book. If you want a feel-good book to get you pumped up about retiring young and rich, then this book is for you."
2,Nothing new here.,"Just another real estate huckster hawking the ""Quit your job and buy Real Estate and my other products"" approach. Go to any used bookstore, look in the real estate section and you can buy these concepts for a couple of dollars. RY, RR is nothing but a catchy new cover on old material.Twenty years ago I read Bill Greene's ""Think like a Tycoon"". THAT'S THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ!Retire a little richer and pass on this one."
4,"How to &#65533;BE&#65533;, not how to &#65533;DO&#65533;.","I listen to the CD's over and over again (nothing else to do on my 2 hour drive to work). The one thing to remember is that this book is about how to ""BE"", not how to ""DO""."
1,"Write a book, get rich","Too much ""context"" not enough ""content"". The main point that Kiyosaki left me with was, ""Hey, if I want to get rich, maybe I should write a book about how to get rich?"" I will say that the motivational aspects of this book may help those with a seemingly incurable self esteem."
3,A bit old,"This is Rich Dad Poor Dad reprinted with a few additions. The message of the book is correct: create assets that create passive income, avoid debt, get out of the rat race, don't count on job security etc.One element is missing, though. The risk of building a business is also high, as well as failure rate. Kyosaki is a very successful businesman, but like many other successful people he fails to mention the role of chance in building a successful business. Yes, if you persevere, you may build a good business and become financially independent. But you also have a chance of being broke, bancrupt and have a heart attack. Dentists on the average financially do better than college dropouts, even though some of the dropouts may become very rich, like Bill Gates.By all means, read this book and follow its principles. But read also Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness"", a sobering balancer."
3,good book.,"this book really marked a turning point. after reading it i started trading in options and investing in real estate. its has a lot of good advice, but like his other books has no real steps you can implement. for that you'll need to look elsewhere."
2,Just milking it...,"Read ""Rich Dad's Guide to Investing"" and forget about Kiyosaki's other books - the third book in the series captures all the ideas this man has. If you must, browse through the other books in the bookstore - you will realize that the information is repeated, and that you can save a lot of money by not buying his other books."
3,Overall good book.,"The book helped me overcome several of my self imposed limitations, and also helped me understand the roots of my limitations. (Think outside the box as Robert puts it). All in all, I'd have to say it was very easy reading and the author succeeded in getting most of his points across very clearly.The bad points: On average, every 10 pages or so you will find plugs for his other money making ventures such as his game, his other books, and his seminars. I agree with one of the other reviews in that he does not go into detail about how he managed to build his empire while keeping away from the employee way of thinking, which was what I really wanted to hear about. Also, he makes tons of references to his other books, and things that he mentions in them, so at times, I felt like I was reading a second hand book."
1,Don't buy this book.,"This book should be free since it offers little more than Robert Kiyosaki selling his other books and games. If you want to retire young and retire rich, own a little real estate and write a lot of lousy books. That is the message I received."
2,So So,"This book is a bit too abstract. I would have liked it if he had described a bit more the sweat and heat of running a business. And he says he retired at age 48. To me, retiring young is more along the lines of what Eddie Murphy said, ""I always knew I'd be a millionaire by age 21."" That's young! And if Kiyosaki didn't retire until age 48 (and he retired on a fairly unimpressive five-figure passive income) EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN COACHED BY HIS RICH DAD SINCE AGE 9, a reader older than 9 can tend to feel it's too late to start the multi-years process of getting rich, which for Kiyosaki involved being homeless in his late 30's. And I confess, I'm older than 9 myself!"
1,This Guy is a Con Artist!,"This guy is the latest in a forever march of con artists trying to sell kook ideas with a book. I read the book and researched the writer, his background cannot be verified nor can his income, but I am sure it is much higher after selling this book.He is a low middle class reaching for the upper class, by givingmiddle-middle class the ""shakes"" on how they will die pennilessand destitute in future unless they end their $inful way. There are two ways to make money, you either earn it or inherit it. So that making yourself nervous and get busy doing one of these, hell go find a rich wife or husband!!!"
2,Deja vu,"I read this one after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad - the first in the series. I can't say I learned anything new. The author's point of view is made clear enough by the first book, and as I put this one down I got the feeling it was time to move on to books by others, and broaden my perspective on the subject."
4,Has value to read,"Actually, I think this book is not good as same as before. Not enough information to know how to get rich or retire young. But it has value to spend your time to read, if you want to know why ""It doesn't take money to make money"".But, I think his first book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is far batter than this one.Anyway, ,go to get it and you will enjoy this book."
2,"Retire Young, Retire Rich is disappointing","This was my first foray into the ""Rich Dad"" series. I decided to pick this up to see what all the hoopla was about. This book is long on concepts and improving your mindset and short on telling you HOW to accomplish the goal.Kiyosaki drones on, frequently referring to his other books. After the first few chapters, I gathered that his plan is to invest in real estate and start your own businesses, but there is no substance to tell you where to start DOING any of these things. I guess that I was expecting more of a ""how to"" guide to achieve the end result.Now that you know what you SHOULD do, skip this one and go find a nuts and bolts guide to real estate investing or starting your own business."
3,Still good.....,"The discussion on leverage is pretty good. Still worth buying if you like Robert's motivation and his stories for your own life and business needs. I still like it even though I gave it 3 stars... Reading the first 1/3 part of the book is quite annoying because he keeps repeating his stories and his points as in his other books. However, maybe that is how we learn, through repetition.. I prefer his ""guide to investing"" book - it's more practical and useful."
2,repetition of the very first book,This book is very interesting and teaches a lot of common senses. Unfortunately - like most other books of the Rich Dad series - Robert repeats his messages over and over after 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' without adding extra value in the new books. His message is: be your own boss and that can be found in his first book. Another weak point is all his books tell you the 'why' but not the 'how to'. My advice: read only the first book in the serie.
2,Where is the beef?,"Although this book covered some very interesting and some what complicated concepts (such as Context vs. Content; different types of leverage), I find this book contains way too many fillers and self promotions. Not only did the fillers wasted a lot of the readers' time, it also hurt Mr. Kiyosaki credibility as an financial educator. We all know that Mr. Kiyosaki is getting rich by selling books like this one. I feel he is milking his ideas too much. I know one thing, he just lost me as a returning customer."
1,He Could Have Just Written a Pamplet for the Content,"I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and loved it. This book however is a lot of fluff. He regurgitates the same ideas and words 5-10 times throught the book. A lot of self-praise for himself (and Kim). Not enough original work to justify a whole new book. Looks like the ""Rich Dad"" product name is getting extended a little too much.Do yourself a favor and just stick to the original book. For the first time ever, when I finished this book I immediately threw it into the trash."
4,"Good book, not great, but worth a read.","I thought this was a pretty good book. Not much on How-to, more of a Why-to. The author spends most of the book recollecting how he became wealthy, and gives some good advice on why you should press on when things look bleak. I liked it, and I came away with an understanding that in order to be where you want to go, you have to focus on your business and goals with a singlemindedness that most people aren't willing to reach. Anybody can do it. I haven't yet, but I will. It's worth reading if you apply what you learn."
2,"Long on theory, short on specifics","While there are some good general concepts to be learned, the entire book (335 pages) could be shrunk 75% (easily) and there would still be ample room to get the points across. Lots of wishy-washy, big picture stuff (nothing wrong with that if that's what you need, of course)."
3,Thinking in the right direction,"For those who have read other Kiyosaki books, you won't take away any significant new information from this book. It's worth a read if you need a mental refresher course in the Rich Dad basics. Personally, it got me thinking in the right direction again after going a few months without action toward my financial goal, so in that sense, it was worth my time. I'd recommend borrowing it or checking it out from your local library. The money you save may be better spent on a title more specific to your investment interests."
2,Meh,Read this book in a weekend and was not impressed at all. The author repeats ideas over and over again that were dated even when the book was initially published. This wasnt the life changer that so many people have said it was. I left my copy in a navy laundry room library in northeastern Africa. Maybe someone else can get some use out of it.
2,Not very helpful,"This book repeats itself so many times it becomes an annoyance. The book could have been written in about 50 pages. Really the mantra is: Own a business or real estate or stocks. Being employed is bad. Yep, got all that. It does manage to make you think about how truly aweful it is to be an employed toady, but like most books of this ilk there is very little there to help you get started. It read like a multi-level marketing meeting."
2,I Only Knew Fred,"Although I have not read Fritz and Etta Mae's book I encourage you to read ""The Half Mile Miracle"". This book gives more insight into the other side of the coin of Fred's illness. Fred's partner, Rocco, was with Fred before his Aids illness and was his sole care-giver until his death. We all loved Fred and miss him greatly."
5,A ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS!!!!!WHAT WOULD YOU DO?,"A MUST READ!!!!! THIS BOOK ALLOWS THE READER INTO THE LIVES OF THIS FAMILY,IT ALSO SHOWS YOU WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS , AND IT ALSO SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY! AND THE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE OF A FAMILY, NOT TO CHANGE PEOPLE, BUT TO ACCEPT PEOPLE THEY WAY THEY ARE. AND LOVE THEM THE WAY GOD SEES US (UNCONDITIONALLY) SHORT READ I READ THIS BOOK IN 2 HOURS REALLY GOOD MEMOIR.TOUCHED MY HEART AND LIFE AND MY WAY OF THINKING!"
5,Where?,"I have used Pet Tabs for years, and my dog loves them. However, I read the gentleman's review concerning where these were made, and I too share that concern. I zoomed in on the product's picture, but could not see if these were still manufactured in India or if the site is now in Nebraska. Does anybody know? Thank you."
5,Great for the money,Both my dogs will eat them. I give them one a day and they will eat them as they are chewable. This was the best price I could find on the internet as well.
2,"First time purchase, but vitamins made in India??","Okay, I don't have anything inherently against products made in India, but dog vitamins? I only saw that after they were delivered. I've been to India and it's still very much a third-world country and I just get a little concerned as to potential quality control issues in a country where you wouldn't go near the tap-water. I love my dogs and really try to make sure that I get quality products for them...I think next time, I'll try to make sure that they're a US made vitamin, even if they're more expensive."
5,GREAT FOR PETS,I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR FOUR LEGGED PET. I GIVE THEM TO MY PET BYSON EVERY NIGHT JUST BEFORE GOING TO BED. IT IS A MUST HAVE ITEM FOR YOUR PETS.
4,Vitamin Treat,"I work with detector dogs as well as have canine pets of my own. ALL, even the picky eaters, love to eat the Pet-Tabs Plus tablets. There are other vitamins on the store shelves that provide more essential vitamins and minerals, but not at the manageable cost of the Pet-Tabs Plus."
5,Excellent product!,"I've been giving my dogs Pet Tabs Plus for years. My vet originally recommended them as a vitamin supplement. Our dogs have done great on them, along with excellent care, and being spoiled, we will keep them on the Pet Tabs Plus."
2,Sorbitol is not good for dogs,"I have not used this product, so obviously I can't vouch for its efficacy. However, the ingredient list includes sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that is bad for dogs. It affects blood sugar for dogs and can cause sudden drops in blood sugar and liver problems. Just a heads up."
2,Ingredients are not healthy or allergy free !,"A much better product to feed your doggy is "" Mega Pet Daily 180 cap "" by Azmira.Look up the ingredients !It's more expensive but also better, as usual.Mega Pet Daily 180 caporSolid Gold Seameal Mineral and Vitamin Supplement for Horses, Dogs, and Cats (1 pound)Please check out the ingredients since you love your pups."
5,Vitamins my dog loves and does her good!,I've had these often for my dog and she loves them. She seems to be healthier and her coat is nice.
3,Cool looking phone,"This phone has great looks, some nice functions like:1- Caller ID2- 10 one touch memories3- Call back button(there is why the 3 stars)BUT, the speaker phone is not really good, if you are alone, in complete silence, you will hear it, but if you're in your home or office with ""some"" noise, pick up the hand set, you will be screaming ""what?? what did you say? Sorry, come again?..."". Also, you cannot set the date and time, this is automatically set with the Caller ID service, so if you are using an analog line or if you don't have the CID service, the date/time function is useless. Finally, I had to change the handset cord, the one that comes with the phone is so short you will be picking up the whole phone if you are standing and your phone is on a low desk or place."
1,NO SUBTITLES PROVIDED WITH ONLINE RENTAL!,"Do not rent this film until Amazon gives you the option of turning on the subtitles. I've watched this film before (it's good!) and you can select ""with subtitles"" on the DVD version. Not when you order it for digital viewing through Amazon ""On Demand"". Wasted $3."
3,just ok,Found this works well but found it difficult to hang onto. Not an easy grip. Would not recommend it for the shower which is where I wanted to use it.
4,Very good,"Works well. Wish it had a way to ""hang it up"" but seems to be worth the cost. Was recommended by bathroom door contractor. Bought on Amazon."
1,Not useful in showers,"One blade or two, this doesn't make a clean swipe on glass or tile. Lots of water left behind. Simplehuman foldaway squeegee works much better."
5,Amazing for the price.... for any price,"Wonderful small, light... easy to focus binoculars.... Amazing for the price and equal in clarity to my $$$ pair of Minoltas from years ago. Highly recommended."
1,Pretty Bad. Even For the Money,Bought three of these to keep on the ATV and in the vehicles. One seems pretty good but another cannot be adjusted for one eye well enough to bring into focus and the other simply has an optic flaw on one side that makes it look like using a fish-eye lens. Pretty poor quality control.
3,Strong Chromatic Aberration,"I had a little more expectation for this pair of $10 binoculars because of generally good reviews. But in reality, the optics is not good. There is strong chromatic aberration that affects its image quality. The neck strap is a toy-like nylon string. Is it worth $10? probably. I will use it for disposable purposes. Is it a real bargain? Probably not."
3,Decent binoculars after much tinkering!,"Just like another review, the right eye piece fell off as soon as I touched it! It's held on by two tiny screws on the base that broke the plastic threads off the eyepiece somehow. After making new holes for the tiny screws, i re-attached the eyepiece pretty easily with some jewelers screwdrivers. Then after only a few minutes of use, the focus knob loosened itself making it very frustrating to use. I wound up taking apart the entire focus knob assembly and having re-tightening every single screw.I didn't want to return the binoculars over loose screws, but it did ruin the excitement of opening my new toy from amazon.Surprisingly, these are powerful and clear binos for their compact size. But the out of the box assembly seems poor. (""Made in China"", clearly printed on bottom)Decent binoculars as long as you have a set of fine jewelers screwdrivers!"
1,Broke in the third trip,"This product was used by a 7 years old girl (my daughter) and without too accessive force the focusing dial simply broke in our third trip and use of it.Because the window of return has ended, I am stuck with it.Buy something else!"
3,OK,"These are good for concerts and events. Comfortable size to carry (they fit in almost any purse). 16x32 is powerful enough for good views on any arena concert or theater. But if you want to ""enjoy nature"", bird watching or something like that, there are much better binocular than BARSKA Lucid 16x32."
1,quality of product,"I gave this as a gift. The FIRST time the binoculars were used one eyepiece feel off leaving the binoculars un-usuable. I now have to pay $20.00 to Barska, pay to ship them to Barska and wait 6-8 weeks to have them returned, hopefully repaired. Not worth ordering ahead for a gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nice looking chairs,"I love the look of these chairs. My home decor is along the southwestern, tuscan style. These blend in perfectly, but I have to say that they are not that comfortable. There is not enough padding on the seat, so when you sit very long you can feel the board beneath your legs. The nailheads are nice, the wood work is good, and they look nice. I am keeping them for the look, but was disappointed in them for comfort. These chairs would be perfect with more padding."
2,Game Dining Chair,"Disappointed. Wood looks cheap, painted to look like cherry. No batting in back of chair which I thought was foolish. But overall a nice looking chair, seats well, not too difficut to put together."
5,Total Wackiness on Wild Drums...,"...is what it should be named. Loved it. If you're into somewhat experimental-oriented stuff, you'll love it, too."
5,Amazon does it again,"Visited a friend who had this model corkscrew. Using this information and with googles help found it on Amazon.com. Placed the order and within a week had it in operational mode. Have been struggling for years with other types of corkscrews and this is far above any that I have used. It is highly recommended.Screwpull Table Model Corkscrew, Black"
5,Best Corkscrew I know of,"This is a simple corkscrew with no frills or ""special effects"". It does the job and does it well. You just slide the device over the neck of the bottle, turn the handle and get the corkscrew started, keep turning and the corkscrew removes the cork. (No handles to push down, etc.) Add the Screwpull foil cutter and you have all you need to open that bottle of great wine."
4,simple but effective,"There is an axiom that the more plumbing you have the easier it is to clog it up. This screwpull is simple, but very effective...I was unsure at first...the body is plastic...but it is a heavy plastic and by the very design of the product, you have your hand wrapped around it when it is under stress, so it is more than adequate. The screw is strong and effective...it certainly gets a good grab on the cork. I have only used it 3 times so far, but it seems to me it was worth the money I paid for it...and a lot easier than trying to dig the @#$% cork out with a @#$% pointed stick like I did when the last cork puller I had broke..."
4,Best Corkscrew Ever,"I bought one of these ""Screwpull"" corkscrews many years ago when they first came out. It had a Dupont ""Teflon"" coated screw for smoother insertion into the cork. It worked well even after the ""Teflon"" coating had worn off (which was quite soon).This corkscew has a simple but clever design and works much better than those expensive and kludgey rabbit style openers. They are a waste of money. I had this ""Screwpull"" opener for about 10 years and opened a LOT of wine bottles with it until it finally broke. One of the plastic fingers snapped off....right where it joined the neck. I guess the plastic just got ""tired"" (fatigued) after so much flexing. I give it four stars because of this weakness. And it's also a bit overpriced at $15.00. Except for the metal screw, it's all molded plastic.All in all though, it's the best corkscrew on the market."
4,Not as Fast as the Pocket Model,"The Screwpull Table Model is almost identical to their pocket model except for the handle. The Pocket Model is actually the better of the two - it's quite a bit faster, has more leverage, and stores in a smaller space. 4 stars for this version, 5 for the Pocket.The pocket version is here:Screwpull Pocket Model Corkscrew, Black"
1,Garbage. It broke after about three months,"The two plastic pieces that extend down over the wine bottle are connected very poorly (just a small plastic link) to the top twist and corkscrew. You can somewhat hold them in place and pull out the cork after the two side pieces break off (and trust me, it's 100% guaranteed that they will based on the construction of this model). But it's not worth your money. Screwpull apparently makes some better versions of this product. I bought it because two friends have one in red that they say has lasted for years. But when I looked at it recently, it's not the same construction as this piece of junk. Like so much else, this company seems to have designed later models to break so you'll replace it. I did replace, but with a different brand. It wasn't expensive. But it should have lasted longer than a few months."
1,Ok opener cheap construction,The design is ok and it opens bottles ok. But the plastic construction feels very flimsy and very likely to break. We sent this and the pocket model back.
4,My wife can now open her own wine bottle!,"This corkscrew is pretty easy to use. You place the ""flared"" part at the bottom over the top of the bottle until the top of the bottle reaches the ""stop"" on the corkscrew; then push down and twist the handle until the screw starts digging into the cork. As you continue to dig into the cork, the cork will begin to retract from the bottle until is appears at the top of the screw. Then, just squeeze the top of the corkscrew while screwing the handle in the opposite direction until the screw is disengaged from the cork. Beware that this device is not effective on some bottles that have a large flared opening at the top, but should work on all normal bottles. I haven't tried it on boxed wine yet ;-)I recommend getting the screwpull foil cutter to go along with this!"
1,cheap plastic,"""heavyweight die-cast metal handle offers a secure grip""ehm, the whole thing (including the handle) except the actual thin screw is plastic. the handle is NOT metal, dollar store down the street sells better products"
1,"Cheap, over-priced and junk",I returned this as it is made of cheap plastic and was afraid it would fall apart in a short time. It is over-priced. Look elsewhere.
3,"I've owned two, one better than the other....","I have owned two of this model Screwpull. The first lasted about five years and we loved it. When it failed (splitting down the seam of the forked collar), we immediately went out and purchased a new one at our local kitchen supply shop. The new one has only lasted about 18 months. Same failure in design. At this price point and with Screwpull's reputation for quality, I expect more."
1,Broke Instantly,"This corkscrew felt cheap as soon as I opened the package. Then the first time I went to use it I was thinking, ""Man this feels so chea.."" SNAP!!! Broken.Piece of junk."
1,Broke after 2 uses,We bought this for our board meetings and the wine opener broke after 2 uses. Very disappointed in this product.
3,Very good but....,"The Screwpull is well designed. The long Teflon coated screw slides easily into any cork or plastic wine stopper. Usually, the stopper comes out easily. However, if it is lodged in tight, then things get difficult. Twice, while removing a difficult cork the plastic frame of the device split in half. Le Creuset should use stronger material for this part. After breaking 2 of these, I've gone back to using an old waiter's style corkscrew and, while it's harder to use, it's indestructible and reliable."
5,Now I can open any bottle,"I was one of those who couldn't open wine bottles. This device freed me ! It's so easy to use. It's also extremely durable. Our first one lasted over 10 years and survived many parties until one day one of our friend tried to use it like a conventional bottle opener, by using force! This is one of the most intelligent device we ever had and it doesn't like brut force. Get it and you'll see!"
2,corkscrew,this product is just a piece of overpriced plstic... you can get a much better corkscrew at a store for less than half the price
5,Great wine opener!,"So quick and easy, I can't believe I didn't get one years ago. We've gone through several styles of wine openers, but this is the easiest by far, for the price. If you're going to get something better, it's bound to be the spendier battery-powered models. This one's better for the environment."
4,"So far, so good...","Rating this product is a little tricky for me. We don't drink a lot of wine in our house, so it sees limited use. Because of that I cannot comment on it's durability. However, after a fiasco involving my old corkscrew and a good bottle of Zinfandel, I resolved to get a really good corkscrew. And that lead me to reading reviews and eventually purchasing the Screwpull.And it works like a dream. The first time I used it I could not believe how well it worked. I wasn't even sure if I was using it correctly and then *pop* the wine was open. No cork pieces in the wine. The cork was in one piece(!) and could actually be used to re-seal the bottle. No swearing. No spilled wine. Just incredulous euphoria. Well, actually the euphoria came after the first glass, but a very good piece of equipment. I'm glad I bought it."
1,Awful,Does not work. Cork just stays in bottle. No leverage or movement?. Stick with the pull up leverage type? Tried on two different bottles.
5,A vital compass for NATO's future,"Professor Kay draws on his extensive Department of Defense and academic experience to produce a thought-provoking overview of the key issues before the Euro-Atlantic community. Always irreverent but challenging, Professor Kay has produced a no-nonsense volume which is a must read. John Borawski Director of the Political Commitee NATO Parliamentary Assembly 1987-1999"
1,Extremely disappointing after the first,"I have a large collection of Christian movies, and I especially like David White & Brad Heller. The Moment After is my favorite rapture movie, hands down. Unfortunately, however, part 2 is just awful. I truly love most Christian movies, but this is so poor. The violence is just disgusting. It seems as if the movie was created to be disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing."
4,The Moment After 2 - The Awakening,"The Moment After 2 - The Awakening is the second part of the two part film beginning with The Moment After.The opening scene shows the FBI agent in jail, and his release. His partner has not been with the agency for a while, but is forced into working for the military man who wants his partner found and will do anything to achieve that including taking the chip out of his hand to obtain his goal.This second part has more action than the first, and has a very good end you won't want to miss.I recommend buying the set together. It is worth your time to watch both of them. It is also a very good youth group film they will enjoy watching and talking about when the movie is over."
2,NOT TOO GOOD,"This movie wasn't to good to me, could of had been made more and more better then it was and is.J. Keller"
5,The moment after i watched,This follow up to the moment after is awesome. I've become a huge fan of David White and have been watching all of his movies i can find. This one really is worth buying or renting! The fight scene at the end is awesome!
4,ma2,I received dvd timely and in good shape as posted. Very satisfied with product. I have ordered several dvd's from amazon.com and there been no problems with either
1,cleret dual squeegee,Reviewed many online squeegees. Thought this was the one. Wrong. Plastic extremely stiff. Awkward to use. Returned and purchased stainless steel squeegee from different site. Love it.
2,Hunkaplastic,"""Satin nickel"" is no nickel. It's a hunk of grey plastic. Form is still pleasing, and it squeegees fine. Expensive hunkaplastic, no nickel."
3,it was ok,It was ok not her best work all she really does is strip and you can get that from her website which is a lot better than this DVD. She still looks greats but it is just clips from other DVDs she has been in.
2,She Deserves A Better DVD,"Jaime Hammer is really pretty, and she has that something extra that makes a guy want to have a crush on her & want to fall in love with her. I've seen and spoken with her, and taken pictures of her a few times at conventions, but, unfortunately, I don't think this DVD does her justice.I think if she would watch other strippers & strip club DVDs, work from time to time at strip clubs and gain more experience about what turns people on and what doesn't, and hire a choreographer then she could definitely improve on this DVD.But for now this DVD is mostly only for Jaime Hammer fans."
4,Good light reading,"Modesitt writes well and is entertaining, but he has fallen into the trap of so many fantasy and adventure writers:The protagonist is drawn reluctantly into an adventure not of his/her choosingbecomes more powerful than anyone expectedRights most wrongs the author cares to bring to the readers attentionComes out the savior of the world/nation/all they hold dear (until it is time for a sequel)While this formula is tried and true and makes for easy reading, I am still looking for the author that will challenge their readers not to know the ending before they get there. I have read the entire Saga of Recluse series, and I did enjoy it. I just feel that Modesitt needs to test his, and our, limits a bit more. He had many opportunities to do so in this series, but fell just short at every turn.All in all, I liked the series, but would not rate it in my top 10."
2,more of the same,"This was first Modesitt book in which i was bored from start to finish. seemed to be mainly a repeat of hi sother works, mainly ""The MAgic Engineer"" using the charactors from ""Fall of Angels"". Even the ending comes as completely predictable to anyone who has read the rest of the series. Unrecommended. Try his first in the series, best in the series, ""The magic of Recluse"" instead."
2,Subtlety shortage here.,"Having read much of the author's work, the latest material is getting thin on plot, narrative, and action in favor of unending feminist lecturing. Most of the protagonists have now become so stereotyped as to become one-dimensional. I am avoiding the inevitably strident future work."
2,"The Chaos Balance - mini-me ""Library Binding""","The Chaos Balance - the New Novel in the Saga of RecluseIt would be NICE if Amazon would make it clear that the ""Library Binding"" and ""Hardcover Binding"" are NOT EQUIVALENT IN SIZE! The ""Library Binding"" is nothing more than the mass market paperback binding with a hard cover. I was very disappointed when I received this ""mini-me"" version of the book."
2,White Charger,"Good idea, but some issues: 1) blue indicator light was too bright for nightime driving; very distracting; 2) usb cable easily detached from charger; and 3) charger died within one year. I liked having a white charger that was easier to find in a dark interior, but overall not what I had hoped."
1,Wrong hat,"If you want to buy the old Florida Marlins hat with the old logo, don't buy this hat. It's misleading. I ordered this hat because I wanted to buy the old Marlins hat, but I was given the new hat with the new colorful Marlins logo. Very dissapointed with this and asked for a refund. I looked forward of getting this hat with the old logo, but its picture and description is very misleading. Hope this doesn't happen to anyone else."
3,good drilling,I purchased this to see what fusion dancing looked like. Very long dvd. Very good for practice strength and drilling the basic moves. My arms got the best work out. NO pops and locks. Good for muscle memory. NIce warm up. If You are looking to get an idea about tribual fusion and a workout this will be a nice selection.
3,not very clear to understand,"I like this dancer.but watching her DVD is really not easy to figure out how to do the belly dance. You have to keep pausing and pausing and pausing. In combination section, there is no time between combinations for you to practice. Does she expect leaners to remember all at once?Plus when she is talking about right, actually she means your left; vice versa."
2,Eh....,"I bought this and another bellydancing tutorial dvd and have seen several clips on youtube and things online, frankly I wasn't too jazzed about watching this one. It was very dull and difficult to follow her instructions. While she is beautiful and very talented, I wouldn't recommend this dvd to learn tribal fusion."
5,This is all you need !!!!,"I love this DVD. If you can do this video, you don't really need to purchase much else. I agree this is not for beginners or those unfamiliar with dance. You should have some background or be prepared to study seriously. I LOVE THIS DVD!!!! I felt like I could do almost anything after this. It provided lots of information and material. The warm-ups and techniques were superb. As an inter-disciplinary dancer, this did the trick. I learned sooo much and I have taken classes at FCBD. I haven't seen many more DVDs that really cover this amount of material and so thoroughly. I suggest you get this DVD and skip a lot of the rest. If you are a beginner, take your time. It will come. The techniques she shows also helped with other belly dance moves I could not get until now. I don't think I can say enough to really convey my ""devotion"" to this DVD. LOVE IT !!!!!!!"
1,Wimpy,"Phone still works...except the LCD, can't use it when the microwaves on...always searching for a new channel so sometimes it just drops you off...last time I buy this make of phone!"
1,What a disappointment,"There are very few books my 27 month old doesn't enjoy - we read two or three before bed every nite. But he has had no interest in this one, and I can't blame him. It made the whole process seem much more complicated than a 2 year old needs it to be. It raises questions that he wouldn't think of, and is really much more suited to an older child - who of course doesn't need potty training. For a toddler, it's all about accomplishment, like ""I did it myself"". The digestive process and waste water treatment, which are hinted at, are not where a toddler is focusing. There was no sense of a toddler's perspective in this.I have to agree with another reviewer, who thought this was simply a way to make more money off of the 'what to expect' series, which does include some very good books."
4,Good Reference for Parents - Not for Toddlers,"From the Word to Parents introduction to Angus the Answer Dog activities, Heidi Murkoff presents information on toilet training in a way that is both clever and comprehensive. But what would you expect from the author who also wrote What To Expect When You're Expecting, the must-read for mothers-to-be? Murkoff's potty book answers ten toddler questions about the process. Rather than read it to your toddler from cover to cover as you would a typical story book, keep it on hand as a quick reference guide. When your son asks ""Where does poop go when you flush?"" you can point to Laura Rader's colorful illustration of four flushing toilets leading to a big underground tank. Or when your daughter wonders how to wipe, try the activity Angus suggests and practice her technique on a doll.After reading over two dozen potty books, I think this is a good instructional guide. For similar book, read You Can Go to the Potty by Dr. Sears."
5,The truth will set you free!!,"This book takes the mystery (hence some of the scariness) out of the process, and handles the subject in a matter-of-fact way. Especially good for for independant minded, strong willed toddlers!"
1,Book written in an age UNappropriate manner,"When I first saw this book, I how 'how cute'. However, when I read it to my son, it was a completely different story. He immediately tuned out and wanted another selection. Children who are potty training are anywhere from 18mos to 3+ years. This book is written using language, grammar, and explanations a 7 or 8 year would understand. Explanations are too complicated, lengthy, wordy. Definitely NOT appropriate for toddlers. A poor offering from the authors who are just trying to bank off their 'what to expect' series. There are many other books that are much better age appropriate choices and are more fun to read."
1,Too much info,"This is just way to much for a toddler. When they have a question it can come in handy as a referance for the parent. By the time they are old enough to ask these questions they have conquered potty training. I read to my son potty books while he is on the potty and this one is quite boring, he doesnt have a clue what Im talking about."
1,I agree: over the head of a 2 yr old,"I love the ""What to Expect"" books written for parents, so I tried a couple of the children's books. The explanations are very scientific, which I love, but it goes right over a 2 yr old's head. By the time my daughter can follow this book, she should already be potty trained."
5,amazing!,"this book is great! my son loves iT! when i read the other reviews about it being over the kids head, i was shocked! my circle mothers all love it! without it, my son would still be doing his business in his diaper! its informative and great! i recommend it to everyone! i love it! my son loves it! you will love it!"
1,This Book is Too Much For A Young Child,"MY DAUGHTER IS TWO AND WE HAVE BOUGHT MOST OF THE ""POTTY"" BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IS MY LEAST FAVORITE. THIS BOOK MAY BE FINE FOR AN OLDER CHILD WHO IS LEARNING ABOUT HIS OR HER BODY, BUT FOR A TODDLER WHO IS TOILET TRAINING. MY CHILD LOST INTEREST IN THIS BOOK ON THE THIRD PAGE. I AM A FAN OF THE WHAT TO EXPECT SERIES, AND I HAD HOPED FOR AN EQUALLY GOOD CHILDREN'S SERIES, BUT SADLY THAT WAS NOT TO BE."
4,Good/Solid Lightweight Training Shoes,"Nice lightweight training shoes with good stability. Also provides nice cushion (not soft). Be aware that the fit is true to size. I normally move up 1/2 size up for my running shoes compared to other casual shoes. But with this pair, I did not need to go up 1/2 size."
4,As good as Volume 1,"Lawhead achieves an all-too-rare accomplishment in fiction...a sequel that's as good as the original.The Siege of Dome picks up right where '..Fierra' left off. Our hero, having found the legendary Fierrans, is compelled to save them from the evils of Dome. Fascinating adventure.It's categorized as sci-fi, but I'm more willing to call it fantasy. The characters are transported to an unknown land...where, in true fantasy form, they encounter all sorts of unknown dangers."
4,Better than the first book.,"This sequel to ""Search for Fierra,"" had everything I thought was missing the first book. The characters were well developed, and so was Empyrion itself. I think that this book tells the whole story in itself, and it would be better to just skip the first book. The only thing I didn't like was the end of the story, it seemed to end abuptly and seemed contrived, as if the author was tired of writing it."
3,Chocolate Watchband - '44' (Big Beat),"Decent thirteen track compilation of the long gone,but certainly not forgotten California '60's garage rockers Chocolate Watchband's three album repertoire. Sound quality here isn't the best, but acceptable. Cuts I found most to my liking were ""Don't Need Your Lovin'"", Dylan's cover ""It's All Over Now,Baby Blue"", the Stones-ish ""No Way Out"", ""Sweet Young Thing"" (this tune should've been a huge national hit for the band)and ""Blues Theme"". Give this,often hard-to-find CD a try."
5,Xanth,"Xanth is the absolutely best series I've gotten my hands on! All the books are excellent, and the part I like most about the books is all the puns! I eagerly await some more Xanth novels!"
1,No index?,"I don't know if this is a good book or not.The two copies in my local bookstore had no index, making the book nearly useless. The table of contents says that there is an index on such-and-such a page, but in both copies the book stopped at the last appendix, one page before page given for the index in the table of contents.Perhaps this is a printing error on one batch. I see that one other reviewer found the same thing."
5,A thorough text with lasting value,"This was my second PHP book (after the Quickstart series) and it has proven to be one of the few coding books I can't live without. As an introduction to PHP language constructs, it covers enough to get you started with clear text and concise examples. As a reference, it's invaluable!! Good detail of functions and parameters... interesting stuff on design patterns. I wish there was more instruction on the PHP5 object model, but not enought of an issue to bring down the rating.Overall, a very thorough, clear text."
2,A reference book without an index,"This is a 1000+ page programming reference book that has omitted an index. How do the authors think readers can turn to this book to look up the syntax and usage of a function without an index to find it? I own a copy of the 2nd edition (that has an index) that is falling apart. This one is not useful for more than a paper weight unless you plan to read it like a novel. Perhaps the publisher in charge just transfer from the fiction section.Like many other reviews, I feel that the examples are weak. You have to have a high level of PHP knowledge to understand many of them."
1,Book of lies!,"So, I thought the negative reviews on this page were kinda suspicious. I decided to buy the book anyways because of all the positive reviews. But, whoa! The negative reviews were right. This book sure is highbrow stuff. I mean, if you're an intermediate PHP programmer, you *might* understand this book. It tends to explain concepts on a high level and leave you to figure out implementation on your own.On one hand, the book explains very basic concepts about PHP as if you were some sort of newbie. Then, when it has to get to the meat of actually writing code, then the book treats you as if you're a veteran PHP user. Kinda weird.But, yeah, in general I didn't like this book. I'm no stranger to programming, but this book left me scratching my head."
1,they're right - not a very good book,"yeah, i had to agree with the negative reviews. this book isn't very good. it reads like bad vcr instructions or something."
4,Janet's Reviews,This movie was very entertaining. Kept you on the edge of your seats. Jeff Fahey makes you believe every charactor he plays. He is very underrated. Courtney cox was very believeablle as a blind women. She did an excellent job also. Movie is very much worth your time
3,Easy to watch,"This well acted and directed piece is worth viewing. The concept works, there are blind persons who can ""see"" color, and determine face shape and features. How well this can be done, is the point on which the well conceived plot turns. Jeff Fahey returns as Jack Whitfield this time paired with Courteney Cox creating an engaging easily watch-able film."
3,Fell asleep!,"I think this is a nicely done kit on self-hypnosis, but--as with so many self-hypnosis tapes, I fell asleep while listening to it. I've made the attempt twice now and just can't seem to stay awake. I'm not blaming the kit, itself, but there's got to be a way to stay awake during self-hypnosis...and I can't be the only one who has encountered this problem."
4,Overall very good,"This book and tape definitely helped me to do self-hypnosis. It is very basic and straight forward. I was excited to finally succeed at it. I feel it is a great starter tape and book. If you're truly interested in the powers of hypnosis, don't let this be your only resource. One not so positive note: I had hoped to help my husband enjoy the benefits of self-hypnosis by listening to the tape too. He started to listen and he couldn't stand the lady's accent. She has what appears to be a British accent. He thought it sounded snobby-just in case you don't like this accent you are forewarned. It did not bother me."
4,Great for Self Help!,"The book and tape set really helped me with stress control and migraine headache pain control. I am amazed at how easy it is to self-hypnotize. The book is instructive without being preachy or ""text-book-ish"". Like some others, I find it hard to stay awake during the tape, though.If you're curious about self help through self hypnosis, this is definately worth a try!"
5,"Awesome, but needs one little update...","I have been using this for about ten years. Even when I'm not listening to it, I can go straight into the hypnotic state just doing what I do when I have it on. I have bought this more than once when the tape wore out!!! That is my only beef with it - PLEASE UPDATE TO A CD or offer it as a download. I don't have a cassette player anymore.Other than that, I use it whenever I'm going through a period of insomnia or stress that is interrupting my natural sleep patterns, or just when I want a quick recharge of energy. Half an hour of this is like a two hour nap. I think even the book says that. I have found it to be accurate. She has such a soothing voice with a lovely English accent. A+"
4,"Conscientious and complete ""how to"" handbook","This book describes ""how to"" and covers most possibleuses of hypnosis in a thorough and readable way.stasi2@aol.co"
4,Relaxing therapy,Loved the book. Easy to do and it worked. But did not like the fact that it was on a cassette tape and not a cd.
4,best bra ever,"This is the BEST bra I have ever worn. I have BIG problems finding bras in my size (32F), so when I found this bra, I was ecstatic before I even tried it on. This bra not only makes my breasts look smaller (which, with a small frame, is what I want) but I barely know they are there! It is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn, and I love love love it. I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Best bra on the face of the earth,"My chest is a size 34DDD, and this bra is the only one I have ever worn that puts my chest up where it belongs while holding everything securely. This bra has been discontinued and I am so very, VERY upset about it. I hope Chantelle can come out with something very comparable to it. If anyone knows what the Senso's replacement is, PLEASE let me know in a comment."
3,didn't fit,"I bought this because I have purchased another bra, a minimizer from Chanelle and it is the only thing I wear now. I wanted this for T-shirts, but the cup shape did not fit my shape, so I sent it back. This might be something you should try on in a store before ordering it online."
2,depressing,"I picked this up almost randomly at the library. The description was intriguing and I found the first half of the book interesting, but it just went to such a depressing place that I had a hard time finishing the book. The ""ghosts"" in the story mirror the main character's inner demons which soon completely envelope him in a relentless negative vortex. It's a ride into the psyche of an addict; plenty of self-pity and damage to those around, not much, if anything, positive. Too gloomy for my taste."
3,"Well written and atmospheric, but not very scary","While reading ""A face at the window"" I kept trying to decide exactly what the story was trying to be. Was it a ghost story, an examination of a marraige, or the journal of one man's near descent into madness? I conclude it's all of these things, but I must say I found it rather lacking in the scare department. The main reason I choose a ghost story is for a few good frights, and I can't say I had any here. If a book purports to be a ghost story, then give me a chill here and there. Yes, this one had ghosts but they didn't do much other than occasionally beat up the narrator, and be generally annoying. I did find the cover art very intriguing and looked at the face often while reading, in fact I found that image far more frightening than the story. So overall not bad, but certainly not a stellar ghost story. For a much better thrill that is equally well written try ""Ghosts"" by Noel Hynd."
2,Like biting into an air biscuit,"I bought this book on a recommendation from this site and was unfortunately disappointed. The writing was pleasing and evoked many visual images; however, I never found the characters believable or likable. I found myself hoping all the characters would die. I never found anything scary or disturbing about this novel. It touched upon a couple of cliched reasons why people would go ""bad""...incest and lack of parental love for example. More than likely I will forget I ever read this book."
2,Looking for Ghosts... Go somewhere else!,"This book was not only disappointing, but a complete waste of time. McFarland has no idea about suspense, and insists on painting a picture that is far from frightening. There was a lot that could have been done with this idea, to bad McFarland was the one to lay it to ruin."
5,Sudle and relaxing,"I listen to this when I'm driving home on a friday after work and it is really relaxing. Tanias Voice sounds gentle, sudle and very relaxing. This record is definetly up there on its ranks.I recomend it for those ppl who like relaxing music."
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!!,what a rip-off. i can't believe i paid 6 dollars and was given a few paragraphs of absolutely worthless material. the info given was nothing other than a quick description of what a business broker is. clearly not worth paying any money for. i don't know how amazon would put something like this for sale.
3,"Great game, but some problems with older PS2 systems","Great game for young and old. I gave this as a gift, and the person had problems getting the game to work with their older playstation. I sent an e-mail to tech support, and the information they gave us did not help. This may be a one time occurance, but be aware that this could be a problem."
1,Never played it.,"I bought this for my 9 year old son and he didn't play it. I don't know if he couldn't figure it out, or what the problem was, but we ended up trading it in at GameStop."
3,Good non-violent video game,My child had an earlier version and loved it. The child insisted on they needed this newer version because it was supposed to be better. Only played it a couple times. I think the child outgrew it. Better suited for a 10 year old.
2,Doesn't work on my older playstation 2,"As the last reviewer said. I purchased this for my son and although we can play it, the game is quirky on my original playstaion2. Some buttons don't work and worse - we can only play one player games, not against each other."
2,Nice Try But Not Very Funny.,"As a Korean American, I thought I'd give this a go. Big mistake. With the possible exception of Steve Byrne, they were simply not very funny. It might have worked in an earlier era but filling your stage time with profanity and misogyny doesn't make you funny, just a bit pathetic.What's up with that Dr. Ken? I saw him on the KoreAm awards, and see he's on all sorts of B movies now but he's simply not funny, just embarrassingly loud and persistent. Sort of like a Korean Borat only with no clever social commentary behind it.Though I'd like to support my Asian brothers, I suggest you give this a miss."
3,Dr. Ken is racist!,"I'm Korean, and I totally support Korean talent. Don't get me wrong, the first three comics were funny, but the last guy, the doctor, he was messed up big time. He doesn't sound like a comedian at all, he sounds like exactly what he is: a doctor telling jokes. His jokes aren't funny, at all, in fact they're racist as hell. He blasts Vietnamese guys as being complete effeminite homos, as if having a Vietnamese wife makes it okay. He even blasts Chinese people calling them ""chinks"" in a way like they're disgusting pieces of crap. What an idiot! A Korean guy calling Chinese people ""chinks""? That's racist as hell! Being Asian doesn't make it okay, and furthermore, it even makes the comic look dumber because he's putting his own race down.The first three comics have real talent, especially Bobby Lee who shines on stage with a lot of charisma, but Dr. Ken screws up big time."
5,Funniest comics on the planet in one DVD!!,"I came across Dr. Ken's website and checked out some clips of his act and just fell in love with his comedic style. A real doctor by day and awesome comic by night, he flat out rocks. So when he began talking about his DVD on his website, I knew it would be good.It is SOOOO much better than I could've imagined. It features Bobby Lee of MAD TV, Kevin Shea, Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken. They all were hilarious and I'd recommend this DVD to anyone. The Asian comic market is largely untapped and it's shame because these 4 men will blow you away.Most know Bobby Lee from MAD TV and he's awesome but the two standouts on this DVD are Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken. Dr. Ken's brand of in your face humor about the medical field will leave you rolling as well and ""making it pretty"" for your doc in the future. Steve Bryne's physical comedy is very reminiscent of Robin Williams and John Ritter and he's hysterical.Bottom line...BUY THIS DVD...you won't be disappointed!"
3,A little disappointing,"I have to admit being a little disappointed watching this video. These guys are funny, but somehow the presentation made it appear as if they were trying too hard."
3,First two comedians are not very funny!!,I purchased this because of Kim Jeong ( I think that's his name). I think he is so funny in the movies so I wanted to see his stand up. The first two comedians were not very funny but the last two are great.
5,absolutely hilarious!,"i just purchased this dvd, and me and my friend had a great time watching this.i recommend it if you are a fan of true comedy!The Kims of Comedy"
4,Not Bad At All.,"My wife and I visit a certain local Mexican restaurant because it has quite good food. However, perhaps the real reason is that it has some of the best flan desert cups we've ever found. Incredible! As such, my wife got the idea that we might have home-made flan and she brought home a few packets of Royal Flan with Caramel Sauce mix (family size). She indicated that it was easy to prepare and made up eight little desert bowls. Well, the flan was not bad at all. In fact, it was rather good. The only problem was it just couldn't live up to the incredible flan we were used to from the little Mexican restaurant. Such is life.Gary Peterson"
4,"No one is above the law, including President Clinton.",This book accounts the misleading of the American people by their President. The Pilgrims came here to rid themselves of kings & leaders that were above the law. I glad people like Starr have the courage to stick with the truth. The truth will set you free. Its Clinton that made it about sex not Starr or the Republicans.
1,Hatchet job,"While the president has not always behaved admirably, that is no excuse for this sort of drivel. As it turns out, Starr conveniently omitted from the report anything exculpatory of Clinton, e.g., Ms. Lewinsky's assertion that no one tried to get her to remain quiet or find a job for her. One hates to ""shoot the messenger"" who brings the bad news, but this is beyond the pale. We paid $40 million for this?"
1,what a cheesy way to get money,the man must have been a man with alot of time on his hands and likes sex alot
1,"This ""unedited"" version needs editing.","This version of the Starr Report appears to have been printed directly from a download from the Internet. The problems are apparent, especially in the footnotes. For example, at one point an underline for ""id."" causes ALL of the following footnotes in that section to be underlined. Also, the footnote numbering does not agree with the other two versions of the Starr Report, which are consistent with each other. These problems were no doubt due to the speed of publication, but they are distracting. Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that this is the most legible of the three versions of the Report, with large print and a clean font."
1,Consider what this says about Starr as a prosecutor...,"...any half-way competent prosecutor, given the license and budget and political backing that Ken Starr had should have been able to get indictments against Mahatma Ghandi, Mother Teresa and the Pope, let alone a good ol' boy politician from Arkansas.Starr got NOTHING of any importance that stood up."
1,What a Joke,Starr manages to waste our money and our time. He's our joke to the world. It's a shame that Republicans took him seriously. The threat to our nation did not come from Clinton. It comes from Starr's abuse of powers.
5,I got my 40 million worth!,I laughed from the minute I picked it up to the minute I put it down. Someday I intend to read it.
1,40 million dollar trash,If you want to read pornography please visit the local sex shop. I find Kenneth Star's behavior more revolting than Clinton's.
2,"Stripped out immediately,","Immediately upon attaching a blade with the little screw, it stripped out. No I did not over tighten. It's a poor design to begin with to expect the little screw and washers to hold the blade in place tight enough not to spin. If both center of the blade and the peg the blade slips on were square (anything but round) then it would not spin at least. Since I only needed these for a small one time job, I used a glue gun to hold the blade in place long enough to complete the simple job of cutting off a screwhead but it took a long time and i had to re-glue it a few times."
5,Good,"I used them to cut 24 guage steel and they do a great job. I tried on some thicker brass, but it was way too slow, but for thin metals these are great and don't seem to shrink like the regular cut off wheels."
3,Not 100%,"I was told it would be able to cut stone but it only got 1/8"" deep before being to dull to cut any deeper. So it's not good for working with stone."
4,Walker learned at the knee of Hurston....,"Clearly no ground-breaking storyteller in the mold of Joyce, Ellison, or Hemingway, Walker IS, however, a very entertaining and resourceful author who is able to make up with charm what she lacks in originality and clarity of aesthetic vision. These stories, however, lean too hard against the trunk of Hurston's Eatonville folksy charm to make an indelible impression, and the sordidness which is featured in the narrative remains ill-conceived and dangerously ill-informed. For Walker's simple best, pick up a copy of her ""The Color Purple"", which remains landmark in its singularity of ambition and revisionistic approach to an otherwise- tired narrative form."
3,"okay, but not for snacking","I think this cereal tastes okay as cereal, but I like to eat cereals as snacks--right out of the box. This one doesn't work well that way because of the size of the flakes, the fact that they separate from the powdery flavoring, and they stick to your fingers. Of course, you'll probably use hot water with yours. Kashi adds a bunch of vitamins which is nice, but the big hype on oats is overblown. My ex-girlfriend had high cholesterol and calculated how many oat muffins she'd need to get the number down to acceptable--tons of them each day. She's a computer professional & VERY bright--and persistent. The muffins were good too--esp. the smell as they baked. You can't eat enough of this cereal to do the trick. No way. Still, it's a convenient packet & tastes okay."
5,"The Truth, The Whole Truth, Nothing but the Truth...","If you are an Eritrean and you are often at loss for words ( like me) to explain where, why, who, where and what of this small nation,say no more! Buy and give each of your audiences a copy of this book.Michela Wrong plainly expounds the intricacies of one of the longest wars in Africa, making this book to be exceptionally one of the best books ever written that comprehensibly states the Truth, The Whole Truth, Nothing but the Truth about the smallest nation in the world."
5,What Went Wrong?,"A fantastic book written from the inside of the Eritrean Civil war. The author outlines what was quite possibly the most unique rebellion in African history. She does a masterful job of portraying the initial years of the EPLF and their ability to mobilize the populace and utilize the safe havens available to support their efforts. The contrast between Mengistu's governance and that of the EPLF in the initial years is stark and telling. The sad part of the book is the decline of inclusive governance and ultimate strong man rule by Afwerki. Although the title speaks of ""how the world betrayed a small African nation,"" it might well have been: ""How a revolution betrayed itself. It would be a true seminal work if Ms. Wrong did a follow on book or an updated version covering the period from 2005 to the present.I Didn't Do It for You: How the World Betrayed a Small African Nation (P.S.)"
2,my review,"This is the story of three brothers during and after the Civil War and how they were able to find love and happiness after so much death and destruction.The characters seem very real and the places are pretty well described, as well as the general feeling felt by all the people living in the Kansas-Missouri border during those times.Good summer reading."
2,Neither broad enough nor in depth enough,"I used this book to study for the Psychology GRE, and I regret it. The material in the book only covered a small percentage of what appeared on my exam, and in some cases even the material that was covered in the book wasn't covered in enough depth to answer the exam questions. If I hadn't been a psychology major in college, I would have been completely lost if I had been relying on this book alone. The few exceptions were the chapters on clinical, abnormal, and social psychology, which provided a nice supplement to my undergrad curriculum and seemed to cover a substantial portion of the actual test material."
2,Should have been called - A Glossary of Terms for the GRE Psych,This is not a study book but a long list of terms and subjects. It is only good as a first preliminary review before the real study. Get Kaplan it is so much better.Kaplan GRE Exam Subject Test: Psychology 2009-2010 Edition (Kaplan Gre Psychology)
2,"Mildy helpful, but frightening!","I studied from this book for over a month and only scored ""average"" on the PSY GRE. It helped me brush up on a few things but while I was studying from it I found wrong information!! On top of that, I used the internet to get more info/clarification on certain topics, and found that entire topics from this book had been cut & pasted word for word from Wikipedia (including some of the incorrect info), SCARY! Princeton review is good for the general test, but I'd suggest finding something else to study for the psychology subject GRE."
4,This book is EPIC!!!!!!,"I was studying my tusik off for the GRE, but every book I had read was stupid and pretty gay. The first time I took the GRE I got a C-, but then I read this book - and smoked a ton of weed - and then I took it again and I got a B-, which is an improvement of 39%. So, you should like, read it. ALSO, it's pretty funny."
2,Not the best use of your time,"I started preparing for the test with this book, Cracking the GRE, and have since moved on to the Kaplan book. I wish I'd started with the Kaplan. Cracking the GRE reads like a grocery list, whereas the Kaplan book reads like a textbook. If you prefer strict word-pair memorization as a method of study, Cracking the GRE is fine. But if you're like me, and find it easier to remember a term if you feel you understand the term's full meaning, go with the Kaplan book. It just has way more information, which really helps me remember things.Don't get me wrong, this book will probably help you score more points on the test, but I feel the Kaplan book helped me much more. Plus, it was a better read, and I may have actually learned something about Psychology in the process."
4,Good for last-minute studying,"This book was ideal for last-minue studying for the GRE psych exam. It provides a solid review and was basically a bullet-point list of almost everything you need. As a review, great but if you need more in-depth explanations you will need to find more information elsewhere. I used this in conjunction with Kaplan's book and did quite well on the exam. Definitely buy this if you are going to take the psych gre!"
4,Decent review,"This prep book gave a decent review of the topic areas that appear on the psychology GRE, despite how brief it is. I used this in conjunction with Kaplan's book and did quite well. Definitely buy this if you are going to take the psych gre!"
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR/,"IN OTHER WORDS, HEADS UP!!!,,THIS IS SO NOT THE CHOCOLATE WATCHBAND, AS DEPICTED ON THE AMAZON STORE PAGE! THIS A 90S BRIT METAL BAND THAT IS NOTHING LIKE THE CHOCOLATE WATCHBAND, A GREAT 60S GARAGE/PUNK BAND FROM L.A./ THIS IS GRUNGE METAL, NOT EVEN CLOSE! UNTIL AMAZON FIXES THIS, DONT BE A VICTIM LIKE I WAS...BRITMAN 46"
3,The Reunion,"I Personally think this is the hottest joint around. The song's on it are very raw and nothing less of what I'd expect from someone thats been in jail. The Song Phone Time covers the excact mood of the recording. With songs like ""Phone Time"" featuring Artist's such as Carl Thomas and Mobb Deep I give this album a 2 thumbs up"
2,"on this reunion, capone n noreaga take a step backwards.","You will love this album if your a hardcore freak, but if you like slow pace rap you will dispise this album. It has a few good cuts like ""phone time"",""queens"", and ""y'll dont wanna"", but in the rest of the songs you cant tell what song your listening to, because the rap all sounds the same."
1,My dogs will NOT eat it!,"This product smells like bananas. Both my dogs WILL eat bananas BUT they WILL NOT TOUCH any food that has this product on top. I couldn't even fool them by mixing it in. I will never know if it would have eliminated tear stains & basically it was a waste of money.I have now ordered ""Angels Eyes"" Chicken Flavored and they eat that with no problem."
2,Not as effective as Angel eyes,"This is basically the same product as Angel eyes except it has ""filler"" ingredients so there's actually less of the effective ingredient. I found it a lot less effective on my maltese mix's tear stains than the original product. I won't be ordering this again and will stick to Angel eyes."
1,A joke?,"I can imagine how the plans for this one went: Let's pay someone a few dollars to write some stupid story, pay the ""actors"" a few bucks each to attempt to act and fail at it, shoot the same scenes over and over with really dumb effects, and wonder how many times the viewer will fast forward it just to get to the end."
5,"Clean, Hot Fun","This is a true camp film, but is taking a lot of flack because it's filled with scantily clad guys instead of women. It's a bit ahead of its time, but clearly True Blood, Spartacus, and Twilight have proven that there's a market for man candy. Also keep in mind the type of movies and editing style that this is parodying; they were ridiculous with poor special effects."
4,Creepy,This was one of those stories that I found myself thinking about late at night after watching...it kind of sneaks up on you how creepy this actually is. The ending is really creepy! I love a good ghost story.
2,Disappointing,"I love Margaret Cho, but this movie is somewhat derivative. Bam Bam is highly irritating. I just kept waiting for the funny parts to happen. Margaret is great as her mother, but this isn't enough to carry this movie."
2,Dark Humor that's not funny,"I could barely crack a smile during this celebration of hatefulness and meanness directed toward a Korean-American girl and her gay African-American friend.Evidently they are high school outcasts (so weren't most of us) and then they go on a pilgramidge to New York to be on a makeover ""reality"" TV show (hosted by another mean person) during which they run into many hateful people along the way.Why this would be considered funny is a mystery to me. It's not fun, it's not insightful, it's poorly paced, laughily ""acted,"" and insulting to people in general. (Granted, humanity deserves insulting periodically, but this piece portrays everyone as a moron.)If you're a hard-core Cho fan, I suppose this might be interesting, but I'd steer clear of this clunker. It's good moments are few."
4,This is on SUB POP?!?!?!,"Sub Pop signed these guys? How did that happen?Anyway...If it weren't for the Ramones and the Descendents, Chixdiggit! would be the best pop-punk band of all time. Actually, those first two bands would be a good reference point.The basics are as follows, major-power-chord riffs with fast tempos and the most infectious melodies Blink 182 was never good enough to come up with. And they always seem to toss in a guitar solo, even if the song is only a minute long. Nice.Yes, some of the slower songs are lame, (""Hemp Hemp Hooray"" I'm looking at you) but the fact remains, these songs are fun, funny and will stick in your head more than that dart I just threw.If you liked the more fun aspects of the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, and the Descendents, than this album will never leave your car's CD player.And if you like this album, its just as good as the other three they've released, so pick up the rest and enjoy some catchy hooks!"
3,definitely a first time effort,"This book had a great premise, great characters and I love the time-frame but it suffered from first time syndrome. Lots of cliches at the end and a villain who just wouldn't go away.There was also a silly secret that the heroine had that youcould see the resolution of a mile away. I hope that the author will improve on her next try and I'll be willing to read it if she does."
4,Cool New Group,"I only found out about this album because I am a fan of Matt Garrison from his work with John Mc Laughlin and Gary Burton. I read an article in a magazine dedicated to bass players (Bass Frontiers) about Garrison and I came across Nat Janoff's name. I had heard of all of the other guys Matt's played with but not Janoff. I did a little digging on the internet and got his CD, ""Looking Through."" It's a great CD-Garrison and Gene Lake (drummer) are smokin' and Janoff is an excellent guitarist. They sound like they have a great chemistry together. I know all of these guys live in the NYC metro area- I'm waiting for them to do some playing in the city. If your reading this, get some gigs together so more of us can hear you!"
3,"Love Exterminator, but...","Exterminator: Thoroughbred Legendsis unfortunately a bit dry (compared to, say,Kelso: The Horse of Gold, orSeabiscuit: An American Legend), so the power and excitement of this one-of-a-kind racehorse and his knuckle-biting racing style, not to mention his trials and tribulations, are not conveyed. However, if you just want to know more about Exterminator's brilliant career, this book will do, down to the NTRA racing charts for all his 99 (yes, 99) races."
5,great cake decoration,The item is of great craftsmenship. It is exactly what I expected and will look forward to years of using the item because it is just what I wanted and even more. I highly recommend this product and the seller.
2,Replacement cushions are too hard to find and too expensive,"I've never owned headphones/earbuds that cost more than $5 before! I was getting tired of having to replace broken buds all the time, so I figured that if I spent a bit more they might last longer. The wires and buds HAVE lasted longer than my other sets however the memory foam cushions wear out over time though and it doesn't look like you're going to find replacements in any brick and motor stores. One replacement cushion is $2.50 and shipping is $5, so you're going to spend $10 just to buy new cushions. This isn't worth it to me. I paid $10 for these in the first place, so why would I spend the same amount for replacement parts? This is wasteful, both financially and environmentally.As far as everything else goes I'm not an audio snob so to me the sound quality is just fine. They really do cancel out a lot of noise and they are quite comfortable."
4,best so far in the price range!,"After I lost my high-end earbuds about a month ago i set myself to get a cheap replacement.Went with the Koss Sparkplug...big mistake!!!put them on and felt like going right away to the store to return them. Decided to stick with them, and after 20 days they broke!!So..went again looking for headphones, and got these today.Keeping in mind what you're paying, i can say i'm extremely happy with them so far...the earbud stays in my ear, the sound is clear and not overpowered with bass...they even look like they could last a couple of months! So, in spite of my previous reservations about throwing another $15-$20 to the garbage, i can say i'm glad i got these things!"
5,Excellent Buy,"I bought a pair and all I can say is: Wow! I was just looking for a replacement pair for my little workout radio. These things are unbelievable, they genuinely rival my lower end Sennheiser over ear headphones, and blow them away in the bass department. Plus they fit amazingly well and are super comfortable. They don't slip or dislodge even when running.I've never heard deeper or harder hitting bass from headphones, I can even hear notes that I generally only ""feel"" on my car stereo. Every other sound range is very well reproduced as well. Even without music they are very sound deadening. Definitely reccomend, whether if you play your music loud or soft, and especially if you like hip-hop or Rap."
3,Good Value,"For the price, these actually offer reasonable sound, but they are somewhat muddled and not representative of most ranges. Still much better than most stock headphones, considering the price.The sound isolation is about equivalent to middle-line earplugs if inserted correctly, and they are pretty comfortable to me.These do tend to fall out after a while if you are doing anything active.If you are interested in upgrading your stock phones but are cheap, these are the ones to go for under $50. Recommended."
2,Sad sad sound,Definitely more comfortable than the regular ipod headphones but the sound blatantly sucks. There is about 0% bass that can be heard. Waste of all money.
5,Great buds :),"I was lucky to stumble upon these earbuds - after which i've now bought two pairs. I found these and not only is the cord of excellent quality (i workout at the gym 5 days a week so they need to be durable), but the SOUND was fantastic. the buds are 'marshmallows' - squishy and like earplugs, fit right into the earcanal - when they expand and the volume's on (not necessarily high volume either), they block most, if not all outside noise. Used these on the plane and fell right asleep to music too. I had a pair of $60 sony buds which i loved - but between the cord fraying within a few months and the fact that they were so expensive to replace (i had thrown out my receipt), i was looking for an inexpensive pair. Overall, I definitely recommend this product. Bought 3 pairs for the price of one sony pair."
5,The best value/sound/comfort hands down!,"JVC HA F130-B-E - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - blackThis is THE BEST set of ear phones for the price with the most comfort I have ever had (I have not had the bose). I am amazed every time I listen to them. Whoever said that the bass is off must have gotten a bad pair or dropped them in some liquid (I dropped mine and they didn't work as well after). Anyway the bass is unmatched and the marshmallow peice surrounding the ear is so comfortable and blocks out a lot of noise. But like a previous review the only problem is how dirty they can get if you don't wipe them every day, but they give you an extra pair of marshmallow surrounding peice. They are certainly better than the ipod brand that makes your ears scream...The only thing I would change is the length of the chord. It is too short. I'ts about 2 feet so in the winter when the iPod is on my belt clip and I have a big coat on it barely reaches my ears without strain (I'm 6'3"") but other than that great earbuds."
4,A Question,"Though I agree that for running and such these may not be the best otherwise they serve pretty well. I do have a question though, does anyone know if it is possible to replace the marshmallow buds? They wear out and now I cannot find anywhere to replace them. If you cannot replace them then I would say these are pretty poor as the buds do wear out in time."
4,Stood up to the reviews,"Pretty decent ones. Had other reputed ones for cheaper price, but the good reviews got me to buy it.Audio quality is pretty good. The only problem I see is that the ear buds could be a little bit weird to look at. They could get really greasy after some use."
2,i have to agree with the 'tinny' reviews,"Don't know what others, who say ""sound quality is affected by how you wear them"", are doing, because they always sounded pretty much the same no matter how I put them in. I'd got these to replace a pair from Griffin(which sounded fine) that lasted ~1.5years before the cable at the plug end flexed itself to death. I threw these JVCs in a drawer and got a slightly more expensive pair, Sony MDR-EX36 , they sound fine just sticking them in my ears, no special technique required."
2,Didn't work for me...,Only when jammed into my ears would these little devils produce good sound. They fall out when jogging. Much to finicky.
2,Don't like them...,"I actually bought these at Circuit City, and the salesperson assured me that they would be great for running, working out, etc. I've run with them a few times now, and they constantly fall out!!! They may be great if you aren't going to be active, but I've had bad luck with them so far."
4,Good book!,"I think this book is a very good book. It was required for my LING 316 class and I think it is a very good book for teaching methodology and the principles of teaching English such as explaining how to do various activities within the classroom without making some students feel left out. I found the text a little difficult to read as it is designed for graduate students, but I seemed to do well reading it aside from that fact."
3,How to know spiders - but not unless you have a magnifying glass,Book is more on a textbook level than for average identification of garden spiders on the move. B & W illustrations of tiny body parts that would not be easily visible on spiders still in nature. Good for science. Not great for someone wanting to do identification on spiders in the wild.
4,Excellent book for those wanting a deep knowledge of spiders,"This book is not for beginners. It is a manual that gives in detail the anatomical differences among various spiders, which makes it suitable for someone studying spiders in depth. There are many diagrams of various spider parts. A person using this book would need a suitable source of magnification to be able to observe the tiny details on a particular spider. Overall, it is a book suitable for college or post graduate level information."
1,Not a very good design. Expected better quality.,"I purchased the DW317 This saw is not good enough to justify $105 with tax or the bonus sander to boot. The motor runs good its a bit noisy. The black plastic for the orbiting settings seems cheap. It is very unfortunate that the saw's shoe base vibrates out of adjustment because it has no notches or indentations for pre set angles. The saw base also has a huge slotted bolt head making it very difficult to tighten and loosen. Customers will need to file or grind a very wide screwdriver thicker for it. The included T shank style blade can be pulled out with finger tip strength alone. This saw will however securely hold the U shank blades rock solid and only let go when the blade release is pulled. Finally the saw does not cut straight with a good blade in it. The blade holder has side to sided movement almost 1/8"" on a new saw."
2,Wandering blade,This is a very disapointing tool (and was my last dewalt miss fortune).It is very hard to do a straight cut wihtout having the blade wandering. Even using a guide and a slow feed rate the cut is far from perfect.The sole doesn't retain the 90 degree setting which mean that you constantly have to check for squareness.
1,Wish I could give it a ZERO.,"I don't own one of these saws now, but I did for about 2 weeks. I bought it two weeks ago for a project and finally got it out of the box to use it last night. I had it out for less than an hour before I decided to return it.First of all, the blade would not stay in the saw (the quick change feature is a bit too quick apparently). When I did finally get the blade to stay in it long enough to try and make a cut, the saw wouldn't even cut a straight line.Needless to say I took the POS back to Lowe's and bought a Porter-Cable saw that was $10 cheaper after reading reviews about it (on my iPhone while standing in the Lowe's store). The Porter-Cable is a much better saw.Shame on DeWalt for selling such a piece of junk - I bought it because of the DeWalt name - the name DeWalt is now mud in my book. Don't buy this thing!!!!"
5,Extreme power.,This is one of the best jig saws I have used in 30 years. Blades quickly pop in and out for changing and with over 5 A of power this saw does not slow down. Cuts through three-quarter inch plywood like butter. Well worth the money.
1,Gears strip out with little use,Have used it very little and the pinion gear which is actually ground into the armature stripped out after a a few uses. Pure junk.
4,Perfect almost perfect,"I have wore out several jig saws in my 50 years 0f wood working. This DEWALT is fantastic, I have only been using it for about 4 weeks but so far I'm totally satisfied."
3,Solid Frontiers AOR Album,"1999's Eye to Eye is the third release from Dutch melodic rockers Terra Nova. It's on the Frontiers label, which should be enough to tell you what to expect: high quality AOR/melodic rock. Terra Nova has something of a Baltimoore meets Lost Weekend sound. It's very slick and pop-oriented, perhaps too much so at times. I tend to prefer the somewhat heavier melodic rock bands like Pink Cream 69 and TNT, but this is still an enjoyable album. It's not an album you'll want to go out of your way to acquire, but if you run across a copy it's certainly worth checking out.The track listing is as follows:1. Eye to Eye2. Wild Thing3. How4. Lovesick5. Wasting Time6. Promise You Wait7. Right Now8. Break Away9. Not Here With Me10. Holding On11. Those Were the Days12. Real Thing13. Here's To You14. Untitled"
4,Good but not the best,This is really decent Champa Incense but I prefer the 'Red Nag Champa' to this stuff anyday. This Champa has a more 'bubble gum - ish' aroma than the red.
1,Great brand of incense - terrible condition,"This brand of Sai Baba Nag Champa has always been my favourite. That's why I was so disappointed when I opened the package I received from this seller. The incense box was already open, and the sticks appear to be VERY old and degraded. Half of the material has fallen off most of the sticks, and they appear to be mostly dry.Because it is very obvious that the seller knew this when they packaged the incense (open box, contents literally falling out), I will definitely not be making another purchase from them. There is literally nothing the seller could do to rectify this short of sending a new box for free."
1,Ripped OFF!!!!!!!!!! Don't Buy Incense From this Seller,I read the previous comments about this seller but I decided to give it a try anyways since the comments were dated. The incense that arrived was just as the other person had posted. It is so old that you can barely light it. If you are lucky enough to get it to burn to can hardly smell it even while it is burning. Don't buy incense from this seller. I now buy fresh Nag Champa at a real store. It maybe twice the price but it is infinitely better.
2,Caveat Emptor,"This is the classic nag champa incense that everyone knows. Even if you've never smelled it, once you do you'll recognize it as familiar. It's popular and it's ubiquitous but the problem is that the product just isn't good anymore. At least not like it once was. The formula was changed a few years ago and now, when burned, Satya Nag Champa smells nothing like it does out of the box. There's nothing of the sweet, creamy, spicy and herbal scent once you light it. Now it just smells like sweetened burned wood, even in a well-ventilated space. It's a shame, because even though there are several alternatives that have a truer, purer champa aroma, none of them really comes close to replicating this classic."
5,Nag Champa means Quality,"I'm probably not the most qualified person to write about incense. These sticks look like regular incense ( they're not the short dark ones that have a STRONG Scent that fills 3-4 rooms ). These Actually are quite nice, they burn a long time ( about 40 minutes ) and the scent will linger 12 or more hours after the stick has burned. Its a light scent so it stays local to the room its burned in, but in a central area, when passing by you can smell it... its a FANTASTIC scent, very tranquil. i think this is the best price you'll find for these particular type. One thing is that the packaging is not so good, so you may want to Vacuum Seal, or ""ziplock"" bag them so they stay fresh longer. For a small house or apartment these are perfect,(less than 1600 Sq FT). If you have a bigger house and want the scent to fill it you might want to find the dark short ones.(don't know who makes those)."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,!!DO NOT BUY!!some of these packages of incense have issues burning and often times WONT EVEN LIGHT!!WARNING. DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.
3,incense,"The incense arrived in a very powdery form. I don't know if this was a ""second"" of some kind, or if the product got damaged in the mail. Not so happy with it though as it is not usable to light, but just to smell."
4,AUM...Nag Champa,"I have been around this product for decades... it is THE classic incense. I have heard that some people use this to mask other odors, but for me, i just like the ambiance. So far, i have ordered a few boxes of the 250 gram size, and all were 'fresh' upon arrival. I would have marked it 5 stars, but i thought it kinda expensive. Namaste.Update: November 29, 2011... Last month ordered another 250 gram box of Nam Champa. What i got was 25 boxes @ 10grams/box (these boxes within the large box). This does seem like a positive for 'freshness' sake."
5,Great price for incense,"Satya Sai Baba - Incense, Nag Champa Sai B 250 GrmBought this for a friend who had never paid less for it--under $30 for 500 grams was a deal. If you like incense, then this is great."
4,Schools! Take Note,"If there was ever a book that helped us to realise what happen to us all our lives after going through education, this is it!!! The book has brought out the flaws that the school system has been operating from and that it will need to make some major adjustment if the next generation of young adult are going to take care of themselves in the real world. The bad news is that the system with only tinkle with the existing structure, the good news is that parents can help and support their children in whatever endeavour they choose to do. Parents are the children's No.1 teachers."
3,Skip it and buy Rich Dad instead!,"This book was decent but its really repetitive. He seems to drag on forever making the book a bad read. Good concepts which are also reinterated in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Rich Dad is also a much better book. Don't waste your time buying this one, just get to Rich Dad instead."
4,"""Surprisingly helpful advice!""","As a teacher, I was curious to find out just how much 'damage' this author was going to do to our educational system! After reading it, I discovered the answer: no lasting harm. This is a practical and interesting book that really IS quite helpful. It fills in the 'gaps' that we, as teachers, unavoidably leave in our students' lives. I found myself really liking the suggestions and organizational structure of this book! It contains useful lessons and useable advice for life--much like 'The Mizraim Principles' (based on the life of Joseph the Hebrew) does for Christian readers. I has hoping the information presented within these pages wouldn't hurt my profession. Now, I realize--it just might help! (...)"
5,Witty and Bizarre,"Oh yes, this is a very cool book. I loaned it to my 16 year-old brother and he thought it was great as well. Of course, we had to keep the whole book loaning thing secret from our parents. It is pretty racy in sections but, for the mature reader, a complete hoot."
1,It'd be zero stars if I could,If you want limp wristed look at weak-kneed weekend warriors thinking they are tough then this is your book. If you've never had a tattoo or a pierce or a motorcycle then buy this book and maybe you can fool your church bingo club into thinking you're a badass. I heard a rumor that the authors are actually a couple of Girl Scouts from Scarsdale. You'll learn more about underground culture by buying the new Wiggles DVD.
2,two stars for the cover . . .,". . . which is the best part of the book, for which I commend the publisher. The authors, sadly, are not outlaws at all, for a real outlaw would never call himself one. Maybe this is a book for the ""armchair outlaw,"" because all the advice and information in this book is pretty much common knowledge or common sense. Still, a nice packaging job for a book by two self-promotional squares."
1,Don't Bother,"This book might be for you if you want to read about how awful minorities are (the authors actually state that there are only black and mexican gangs), need help with common sense matters and generally think it's ""cool"" to own a book with ""risque"" topics. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,"Only a nun would consider this stuff ""outlaw""","Can anybody tell me what is ""outlaw"" about drinking (the #1 addiction in the country), piercing/tattooing (we're just now catching up with the most ancient societies and it's all over tv and magazines), or even kinky sex for that matter (anyone out there have an internet connection?)? This is the most dull, boring, unoriginal look at averageness I have ever come accross. RESEARCH was doing this stuff 25 years ago—and doing it right! The authors are goofballs who are obviously terrified of most of the stuff they came across and were to timid to write about it with any honesty or intelligence. The humor is childish and the writing is about the same—and the whole thing looks like it was printed in somebody's garage. Don't waste your [price] on a 50-cent piece of junk like this."
3,Good idea for a book but only did a fair job,"This book covers many alternative life styles and undertakings. It is just unlikely you will gain much insight from any one single ""outlaw activity"". But if you are the kind who has not have any exposure to the alternative life styles, there might be enough information here to make the book worthwhile."
3,some birds not included,"The book is smaller than I thought it would be and some birds are not included, such as the whip-or-will etc... I would not purchase this book in retrospect. I think it is a little overpriced. However, it is good for birdfeeder sightings and yard visitors."
5,Wonderful Book,I own several of his books and this one was of the same high quality. Pictures and descriptions are the best.
5,Great small book for the field,"Bought this for my grand daughter and loved it for myself, too. Nice photos, good info, and the guide being set by color rather than species is useful - especially for starting birders who can see colors but might not know the taxonomic orders of the birds. My 9 year old grand daughter also said, ""the guy who took these photos was really good."""
1,Metaphysical nonsense,"Here we are in the 21st century, and some reactionaries want us to regress to alchemy. Hoeller praises Jung - the well-known Nazi-supporter and racialist - as some kind of guru of freedom, because of his supposed insights into alchemy. Alchemy was just medieval speculation about the origins of life and the 'meaning' of minerals. Hoeller tells us in tedious detail about Jung's entirely subjective views of the 'meaning' of alchemy, as if they were some kind of mystical key to understanding the world! The fact that the reactionary Irridium (who is clearly ashamed to tell us his real name, for good reason) praises this tosh tells you all that you need to know about it."
2,"NOT leather bound, it is bonded leather, which is totally different","I purchased this Bible as a gift. I wanted a leather, compact Bible and the redletter was a bonus. Most everything about this version is accurately described and nice! One aspect of the slimness that doesn't work is that the pages are very thin, which makes them see thru. The text from pages behind shows thru and makes reading difficult. My biggest complaint, however, is that this Bible is NOT leather bound. Bonded leather is a man-made material that uses pulverized leather scraps. Over time it breaks down, cracks, and deteriorates like other synthetics, whereas leather, of course, gets softer and nicer as it ages."
5,Amazing Bible for Travel!,"This bible is great for travel. I am on the road alot, and the compact size of this Bible is great for taking it anywhere and everywhere!"
2,Nice but small size results in very small print.,Small size smaller print leaves one wondering if the bible will be of any value. I will give it a try but thought the over all size would be larger which would result in a decent size font.
2,Very small print,Our son asked for a thinline bible to take to church. This seemed to fit the bill until it arrived and we saw how small the print is....way too small.Disappointed. Will have to make another purchase but will do so at a store where we can actually view the bible.
4,leather compact bible,"I really love this Bible,except the print is so small and a challenge for a baby boomer!Yet,I love it!Fits in purse,bag or backpack.The leather feels good and looks good.I use this and give as gift also."
5,great for purpose purchased,I purchased this Bible for a person in jail. I purchased it from Amazon because people in jail cannot receive something mailed directly from a home address so I could not go to the store and purchase one and send it to them. To be received in jail it must come from a place like Amazon or a publisher. It must be soft back and not hardback and this one fit that criteria. Once received it was just what they wanted. It has sdudy helps for personal Bible study as well as compact enough for a small cell environment. I would encourage others to find an inmate and mail them a Bible.
5,Perfect size to carry - quality Bible,This is a version I enjoy reading. This Bible is well made and a good value. I recommend it if you are able to read smaller size print.
1,Bible had writing inside,I purchased expecting new condition. Description did not reveal that the Bible had someone's name written in ink on the inside page where you write to/from information.
2,"NIV Thinline Bible, Compact","I purchased this Bible as a gift. I wanted a leather bound, compact Bible in a red letter edition. Most everything about this version is accurately described and nice! My complaint,however, is that this Bible is NOT leather bound (false advertizing). It is instead made of some cheap man made material the will break down, crack, and deteriorate rapidly with age. I, therefore, was forced to return the item to Amazon due to Amazon's error. Since I am handicapped, having to go through process of returning items to Amazon is a gross inconvenience and tends to defeat the the on-line shopping concept. I guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing this bible since another customer had already made note of it not being leather bound. I also would have thought that Amazon would have removed the leather aspect from their website."
5,"Portable, durable, quality","Doesn't get torn up in my backpack, is flexible without being weak, and is loaded coming with concordance better than that of my study bible. Excellent copy that makes taking the word with you everywhere easy."
5,awesome scriptures to live out,This product is really convenient to carry around and its easy to share my faith with and reliable for situations going on
5,great game my 5 year old loves it.,It is my child's favorite game. He wants to play it everyday. I highly recommend this game to ages 5 and up.
2,Little Kids,"This game was a gift to me. I wasn't expecting it to be like the real life, but I think It could of been a whole lot better. The game Is great for little kids but I don't recommended it for teens or adults . So if you are a parent or friend buying a gift for a teen dont get this game, unless they are babysitters that could take the game to play it with little kids(or are big brothers/sisters)."
5,"Go, Go, Gorilla!","Feeding the Zircon Gorilla is but one of the most fun teambuilding games included in this book. Sam Sikes rides again as he shares with us more really creative, group, brain teasers! The fun part is - you simply cannot win as an individual, you must work as a team to succeed! The game props can be made with everyday, around the house kind of stuff - nothing else to buy."
2,Incomplete descriptions,"I have dozens of teambuilding books. This one disappoints. Even the format is inconsistent (some activities have a heading ""Time"" that indicates about how much time the activity takes, most do not even have that category). This feels more like someone printed their own notes on activities they are very familiar with...not written for someone who has never seen the activity before. For example, ""The Grid"" looks like a great activity but there is danger for the group making errors--they will lose ""one resource."" Unfortunately, Sikes never tells the reader what a resource is, nor how many each team should begin with. Some of the activities are simple and great (and if you like these, get Miller's Quick Team-building Activities for Busy Managers), some are unbelievably complex, and ther is one that requires advanced ropes course training to perform!"
3,Leadership Studies Class,Using the ideas to help teach a leadership class to 17 & 18 year olds. So far have only used a few of the activities. The students are enjoying and learning.
4,good gift,"This poster is as depicted. It is on heavy poster paper, slightly exceeding expectations. This made a great gift for a female exercise enthusiast."
5,A tour de force from a literary master...,"John Farris returns with Phantom Nights, a Southern Gothic told with the patience of Hemingway and the character insight of Cormac McCarthy. Phantom Nights might fall into genre fiction, but fans of Southern Lit, Horror, Mystery, and Literary Fiction (whatever that may be) will be hard pressed to deny Farris' talent for narrative, pacing, characterization, and wordplay. John Farris has been criminally underrated in recent years, and I challenge anyone to pick up Phantom Nights for themselves and not wonder why he's not competing with the Grisham's and Dan Brown's and Dean Koontz's atop the NY Times Bestseller list. Those writers can't hold a candle to Farris' immense talent. Find out for yourself."
2,"It worked for 4 months, then quit","We live in Southern Cali, where we have no air conditioning. We bought this fan in July, and it's now Nov. and doesn't work anymore. I can push the power speed button and the motor won't power up and run the fan.I loved it when it did work, but I am VERY Dissapointed that it stopped working only 4 months after purchasing it!"
2,I was glad I purchased the fan until...,"I tried turning it on a few minutes ago and it no longer works. The lights come on but the blades on the fan will not go. It was a great fan. The remote control came in handy and the size of it was perfect-not too big, not too small. The different features of the fan was neat also. I also liked the speedy delivery. I ordered it Sunday and received it Tuesday. But considering the fact that I purchased this fan in June and it is now August I am a little disappointed. I guess mine was defective :("
3,Pretty good fan,"I have no complaints on the fan so far. It's a nice slim unit and good to circulate air. It is kinda loud on the high setting, but it's not overbearing. I like the remote control feature but it's not used that often. I also like the timed feature where it turns off after a certain amount of time."
4,Good fan,"This overall is a good fan, and on high it can move around a decent amount of air arond with the oscillating grill on. The ""natural breeze"" settings are annoying and I see no point in them. The remote control is a nice touch when you use this fan in a large room and don't feel like constantly walking over to change the settings. The fan does feel a little cheaply made, but it seems to be able to take a couple of beatings. For this price, I recommend this fan, but to those who live in places with freakish heat waves that surpass the 102 degree mark, i would suggest a much bigger fan that moves around more air, but anyone else should check this thing out."
3,"Reliable, Kinda","We've had one fan since 2005 and it has worked great. It's a little on the large side and a bit noisy but other than that it has performed perfectly. The remote is a big plus and since having this fan, it's a wonder why more fans don't come with one!We loved the quality of this fan so much that we ordered another one. We opened it up tried it out and it worked great. Then about a week later when we needed it, it would not turn on. It was completely dead. We sent it back and got a full refund."
3,"Good fat, a bit on the loud side","This fan is great, tons of easy settings and of course... a remote (crucial). It can be loud, but I like to sleep to the buzz, it's calming."
4,Holmes Remote Control Fan,"I am very happy with The fan, once I got it to work right..I had to replace the plug as it kept shorting out. Also bought one for my neighbor. The plug on his was fine."
2,Whistling fan,"I bought this fan based on the reviewers who called it quiet. However, even at the lowest setting, the fan makes a whistling sound, like the lowest note you can whistle. It's more pronounced at the higher speeds. I expected the usual white noise of a fan or even some motor hum, but the whistling got on my nerves and kept me awake. Beware if you're sensitive to sound or are using it in a quiet environment."
5,It does the job,We bought this fan to create white noise for our 7 month old son and replaced a box fan with it. We wanted to be able to put it out of reach when he is old enough to get hurt by it. I liked that it was small yet still 'loud' enough to drown out the city noise from his bedroom.
2,This was a great fan for the first 6 months.,"After 6 months, the rotating feature stopped working. Then the fan motor got weak and we had to take a long object to kick start the blades, and finally after about 1 year, the fan died. A fan that expensive should last longer than this."
2,"O.K. fan, but wouldn't buy it again.","This fan puts out the air, but it is too noisy and too bulky. I wanted to use it on top of my dresser, but it takes up too much room. If you put it on the floor, it doesn't direct the air where I want it. I would give it a better review if it was quieter. I do like the remote control feature."
3,"Seems nice, but mine was defective","I ordered this fan, and the unit I received had an electric plug with two fat ends that will not fit into any outlet / extension cord. Otherwise, it seems like a nice unit."
5,truly one of the finest folk/Celtic records avaliable today,"This record is breathtaking; Susan's unique ear for arrangement brings to life the traditional songs, forming them into stunning echoes of today's sound united ultimately to the centuries-old ideals that created them. It is complete. When listening you are both transported forward and backward in time by her effortless alto."
3,ginsu knife,this knife is not as good as the one i was replacing. it is heavier on the handle and not as sharp as the other one was.I am dissappointed in it.
1,Ginsu Slicer,Not what I expected I have another I have had for years this is not the same much heavier and teeth of knife not very long or indented.
3,not the original,"I have several Ginsu knives I've bought at fairs, and I love them. I bought this thinking it was the same. It's a good knife, but it's much thicker than the originals, so it's not as useful."
5,Best knife ever,I had this type in the 80's and it got lost this is a fantastic knife and would recomend to everybody
1,yuck!,"i have loved my original ginzu knife for years, which is still functioning beautifully. was so glad to see this knife so i could have a ginzu for our weekend home. what a disappointment! the blade is thick and clumsy, rather like hacking up your food with an axe. i thought i could maybe use it for slicing bread then, but it squished it down too. don't know how the product has deteriorated so badly and can still use the formerly trusted name."
3,The Vol. 2 is not as good as Vol. 1,"I received the book recently. Compared with its Vol. 1, this book is not as good. I've just gone over Chapters 14 and 15. The examples are not as clearly presented as the ones in Vol. 1. I have to say this book is not up to my expectations, but the book, of course, can still help."
3,Not the best of this genre,"I really wanted to like this book. And while I've no doubt that John is sincere and has had some amazing experiences, I found this book to be a bit simplistic. There's a lot of hand wringing in between a few lines that would constitute wisdom or insight.If you're new to this genre -- spiritual teacher in human guise shows up to help unwitting human -- you may enjoy it. But if you're well-read, you'd be safe to pass on this one."
2,"Underwhelming, Cheaply Constructed","For the price, and based on the picture, I figured this would be a fairly nice costume, but I was disappointed. The white portions are horribly thin (you can easily see the color and designs on clothing worn underneath). There are permanent folds in the foam pieces (cuffs, shoe covers) and there are many loose threads. Some stitches ripped the first time I put the cowl /cape piece on, even though I wasn't particularly rough with it.Don't buy it unless you're desperate for a cheap Space Ghost costume. You're not gonna get anything like you saw on the live action segments of the show. At least it's recognizably Space Ghost."
4,Good if you already know the basics,"If you are farmiliar with other Adobe/Macromedia software (like PhotoShop, Illustrator, etc.) the transition to Flash using this book should be realitively easy. I learned some new tricks/shortcuts and the sample files included on the CD are helpful. I am very pleased with this book and would recommend it if you know enough to get around in Flash but aren't comfortable.If you are completely new to image/animation or web design software I don't believe this book will help you."
2,"Great for the basics, but you won't become a Pro with this.",Length:: 6:12 MinsMacromedia Flash Professional 8 Hands-On Training (Softcover)
5,Great Book,"This book has really help me in understanding the basics of computer animation.The tutorials are very easy to follow, and the pictures really help view the big picture.Overall I would definitly recommend this book, to novices or professionals."
4,A good way to get a strong Flash foundation,"A good way to get a start with Flash.Although it took me a while to work through the examples in the book, I was happy with the results. This book is for WYSIWYG people though. In the end I was able to do most of the nifty animation ""eye candy"" (via the WYSIWYG) I wanted to do. I also had a semi-decent idea of what to do to get going in ActionScript (although I have a much better book on that subject I'd recommend instead).There are two schools of Flash people (usually): WYSIWYG people and ActionScript people. This book is for the first type for sure. I wouldn't give this book any awards, but it is a good way to start your Flash."
3,It's alright,"It the typical ""how to"" DVD. It was good enough but learning in person is much easier than with a DVD."
3,Very basic,A lot of extra chatter before getting to the nitty gritty and not as much instruction as I was expecting. Very basic.
1,wow,"terrible, terrible album. uninspired ""remixes"" of songs. In some cases they just add a little extra bass and maybe a hand clap beat. The first song ""sauvecito"" is pretty good, heard it on Pandora and decided to take a leap and get the whole album. terrible decision."
5,Great for the Car lover,This book has everything you need to know about American cars. Was a gift for my husband and he absolutly loved it. Very detailed and ideal for the car lover
2,Disappointing,"This is an interesting book, but it is very disappointing. From the description I was expecting the book to focus on the people of Iran. The book is mostly about how Hobson got around in Iran. The lengthy description of her journey into the mountains on an old moped put me to sleep. Hobson's views on Iran are also generalized and out of date. I was hoping her book would give insight on what it is like to travel through Iran as a Westerner, but she just keeps rambling on about how difficult it was to keep pretending to be a boy. I was also dismayed at the way she lied to get into religious sites closed to women and carelessly violated many of the cultural codes.She thought her own curiosity was more important than respecting the culture of Iran( which she claims to admire) I would recommend almost any book in the world over this one. With people like Sarah Hobson on the loose I'm amazed that English travelors are still allowed to set foot in other countries."
2,Good enough...,i guess it's ok because it's portable however it's very atari like. there aren't any good songs and they sound like beeps... i guess since i only played the ps2 version once it doesn't suk too much but if you get this for someone or yourself and you've played the ps2 or gamecube version... you will definately be disappointed.
3,Good movie,"The plot was interesting and the acting was great, however, I was dissapointed to see Summer Glau play as a bad guy."
3,bad balance,The wood handle is too short. This hammer has a balance problem. It is uncomfortable to swing. I have 35 years experience in carpentry.
1,hammer,"The handle broke away from the head the first day I used it, I was very disappointed in the quality of the hammer."
1,let down,"This book killed all of our excitement about coming home and offers no usefool tools or resources. The author states the obvious and basically drones on on an about how horrible it is to come home. If you want to be depressed then buy this book. Poor writting, no content, and not as exciting and essential as it claims to be. It's a big NO NO!"
3,Okay read...,When I love a book it usually only takes me 1-2 days tops to read...with this book it took me a week and half to complete...I couldn't fall in love with the characters and the pace of the story was really slow...this was more a of a fairy tale that was really hard to swallow or believe...I wouldn't recommend this book to others to be honest.
3,Cute,"Somewhat of a Bridget Jones wannabe, but still not bad. Predictable but cute. Nice for an airplane ride but don't expect any surprises."
4,A Fun Read,"This book was predictable in so many ways, but I really enjoyed it. It is light, entertaining fun and a good escapism book. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants something fun and fast to read."
5,Great Saw,"This Dewalt cutoff saw is great. I bought the 12"" vs the 14"" because the price was so much cheaper but in looking at the specs it has the exact same motor. It is a very heavy saw which I first thought was a negative but now believe is a plus. The reason is you can use the saws weight to apply pressure to the part being cut vs forcing the cut with brute strength. The weight gives just the right amount of pressure to cut without binding the blade and lugging the motor.The downside could be that the blades cost about the same as the 14"" but, obviously, don't last as long. I buy the 14"" blades and use them in my workbench cut off saw then when they are down about an inch take them off and save them for this saw. A little bit of extra work but I get more use out of the same money.Would definetly buy this saw again."
5,different perspective,"This DVD is not only visually pleasant but it is more informative than most of the other DVDs out there concerning the area of Rennes le Chateau. It is given from a French perspective by French historians and writers from southern France. It is a departure from Henry Lincolns hypothisis (which still has merit) and it dwells on the main character, Father Sauniere and a strange murder of Father Gelis a priest who lived only three miles from Sauniere and of course, a secret. Taken with Henry Lincolns video, it gives one a much broader picture of the mystery....and more questions. Which for me, is wonderful. I love a good mystery and this one is one of the biggest mysteries in human history. I loved it. I watch it often. There always seems to be some snipets of information that I missed. I recomend it to anyone with an open mind about Christianity and perhaps, human origins."
5,The Extras Make it Worthwhile,"Until I scoured the extras, my reaction was that this was 'over the top.' There were some interesting extra details about Father Sauniere, but there were so many other suggested possible clues -- to what? -- that it was absurd. However, in addition to more details about Father Saumiere, there is a cd-rom with pictures and a halting translation of some of the paperwork associated with Father Sauniere's troubles with the bishopric. -- Louis J Sheehan"
3,"Good maps, but lacks important details","This guide misses some of the most interesting places to stay and completely skips the best restaurants, I think. Also, I wanted to know how to get to the ferry for Isla Mujeres from Puerto Morelos. There is only transportation information from the tourist area in Cancun or the airport."
4,"Ivan A.Backerman (CARRABELLE,FL.)","Concise and excellent travel guide,helpful for my last trip to the Yucatan.Well done!!"
3,so so guide,"Got a bit of everything... Not the details on common activities that are actually helpful in deciding trip. Overall, a good start, but will have to get something more detailed to supplement."
3,Low Budget Fun Fest!,"SEX MACHINE is an ultra-low-budget hoot! Extremely rough around the edges - particularly in terms of acting - one can't help but fall in love with the sheer zeal and energy of this movie. It's the kind of film teenagers make with aspirations of one day working in Hollywood, only done with a skill and vitality far exceeding what one would expect.Reportedly made guerilla style for 7 grand, SEX MACHINE centers on a man who awakens with amnesia and finds his body has been pieced together from several others. What follows is part action film, part comedy, part conspiracy thriller, and all exploitation flick.Full of flaws and confident in itself enough to fly past them, SEX MACHINE is the rare kind of B-movie: as trashy as it is fun. Let's hope someone gives director Christopher Sharpe a real budget, because it's pretty staggering what he already do without one."
3,Short on material,"Definately some goog stuff here, but album is very short. Album is labeled movin country instr. for a reason. All songs are up-tempo and energetic. Questionable selection from jerry reed tho"
2,Disappointing but will use,I was looking for a real yoga DVD to do with my son. I bought it more for the family DVD then for the kids. The family yoga is very short less than 15 minutes. The posses we okay and a few we really did enjoy. The kids DVD is longer and the posses are okay. The instructor's rendition of I'm a Little a Tea Pot looked out of a Vegas Showgirl audition not a kids yoga DVD. My 2 1/2 year old stayed interested in the whole video - although obviously he couldn't do a lot of the posses - but I wouldn't expect that from any yoga video.
1,The fix is in!,"I've played a lot of BackGammon in my days but this farce takes the cake. The dice are loaded in the computers favor. Play 100 games and lose 40 of them because the computer gives you the one role in a 100 that will hurt you,,,,and at the same time he gets the perfect roll to get your exposed man. Once in a while is OK, but it's consistent and annoying. Just because the setting is expert, doesn't mean the computer has to win at all costs, even cheating."
5,NICEEEEE,"I am a skinny guy, 123 lbs most of my life, 6'1 tall so you can imagine that I am pretty skinny. After trying this product for 3 weeks (after every meal) and doing exercise, I gained 6 lbs which is a lot for me. I can eat anything you want but I never gain weight, this helped a bunch."
4,Good for weight gain beginners,Pros: The product does what it advertises. I saw weight gain even with half the recommended serving size of muscle juice and regular training.Cons: Somewhat high on sugar and cholesterol. Causes some bloating. The vanilla flavor may taste too sweet for some.
3,ultimate nutrition muscle juice,"I am a world class masters javelin thrower. At 60 I am in extraordinary shape. 6'3"" and 230 lbs at 12% body fat. I have used muscle juice many times before this latest adventure. I ordered the banana flavered muscle mass. I have a shaker bottle that I mix the product in with milk. I have yet to get all the muscle juice mixed up no matter how much I dilute it. It is clumpy and foams up really bad making it hard to swallow. In the past I have always used chocolate. No problems. I will never use the banana again. Still has a great taste but is too much trouble to fool with. Have to put it in a blender to get it to completely mixed."
3,Meh...,"This gets three stars mainly because it tastes good. It does put on weight, especially around the belly, so go easy with this stuff. Even with a shaker ball this stuff is hard to fix completely. I always had chunks of the stuffnat the bottom. Prob won't buy this stuff again."
4,My review,"This is a good cheap product if you don't mind the high sugar content. I was able to gain 10 pounds from drinking this. I drink a half serving mix with two cups of whole milk, 2 teaspoon of peanut butter, twice a day for a total of around 2400 calories. I also ate other food, so i was eating about 3/4k calories a day. The powder was easy to mix with my blender. I still got almost half a bucket left, after i finish, i won't be buying this again. There's too much sugar. And yes I knew about the sugar amount before I bought it, but I was being a cheap ass, so i bought it. Next time, I would get the 2600 instead. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it did what it was suppose to do, which is help me gain weight."
5,Awesome,This stuff is the best tasting weight gainer i have ever tried... not to mention since using it ive put on close to 10lbs!!
4,Nutrition Muscle Juice,"The product is serves as a good source for calories and protein. Other than that not to much nutritional value. Minimal vitamins and minerals. Good amount of sugar as well per serving (60g), maybe too much. It makes it taste good, a good fix for sugar crave for anyone that otherwise does not intake too much sugar. Good for me because this is the only source of sugar."
4,Best I've ever had,"This muscle juice has to be the best protein drink i've ever tasted, and it doesn't make your stomach bloated."
3,Otherwise would have been great.,"This thing requires two things to work, continued consumption over a lengthy period of time, and that you watch your diet carefully.Taste was very good and on the time it was taken (two months) there was a perceived increase in energy/resistance, but gave up when I realized I would've had to been taking this for a long time to gain any perceptible increase in weight.There are more practical alternatives for weight/muscle gaining on the market, zma for example."
4,has the composition changed?,"I have been a long time user and this product by far is my favorite one. It works for me to gain weight combine with going to gym regularly. I stick with it mostly because I like the taste. However, I started to notice this time that the taste is different, not that I don't like it, but I prefer the old taste better."
4,Really works!,"It works well, taste good, but you can get sick of it like anything you take once a day! I use a hand blender to mix it all up, and mix milk and water, to save on milk but keep it tasting good."
3,"Tasty, but misleading","While this is most likely the best tasting protein powder I've tried (and I've tried many), it isn't all it's cracked up to be. There are just over 1000 calories per serving which is great, and there are 55g of protein which is also great, but a serving is 250 grams. To compare, another powder i had was only 600 calories and 52g protein, but a serving of it was only 150 grams. So if you threw in another 100 grams of that, you'd have 900 calories (almost as much as Muscle Juice) and you'd have about 69g of protein (waayyy more than the muscle juice). So basically this stuff tastes good and has a lot of good stuff in it, but it's partly because they make a serving way more than they should and they don't put in enough protein. It's also a little hard to consume all at once. 250grams of powder combined with 18oz of milk is a lot."
3,too sweet but cheap,"The Muscle Juice has a lot of calories per serving (read the directions).I was warned by the other reviews on the banana syrup sweetness. But I didn't think it was too bad. But it is.Definitely it is better to mix it with fruits, or use to sweeten drinks/beverages. Another important point is the high content of calories. I just had once the full recommended serving indicated by the product, but I felt that it was too much (I got a headache), so I stopped using that dose and used lower servings. In any case, make sure that you do your workout to use all the calorie content because you don't want to accumulate all that in your body. I have been used it for a couple of months with intervals, so I cannot tell if I am getting the results expected by me (muscle growth). It's cheap but too sweet for some tastes, so read the full product descriptions for a more accurate opinion."
2,"It works, but be wary","If your goal is to put on some pounds or bulk up, then this may be okay for you. However, be warned, it contains 60 grams of sugar per serving. The maximum amount of sugar that's recommended for anyone is 40 grams a day. There are plenty of other weight gain powders, many with significantly less amounts of sugar. This product works, but you may be diabetic by the time you finish the tub."
5,Great section on listening,"Though I am in an annual giving position and this uses major gift fund-raising examples, I found the information extremely useful. Especially useful was the explanation of HOW to listen -- I too have searched for ways to teach true listening without luck. Until now. I also benefitted from his outlining of ""4 Magic Questions"" which gives you direction in discovering why someone will/won't (or did/didn't) make the gift. And the book is filled with so many practical suggestions and neat example stories that is is enjoyable to read. Last, I feel it will help you be bold in your asks -- as he says, better ""ready, fire aim"" than ""ready, aim, aim, aim...). If you are in fund-raising, YOU MUST ASK! This book will tell you how to do it right.Most of all, it was so inspiring -- not just a ""how-to"" book. I will suggest EVERYONE in a position to ask for a gift in our office get a copy."
2,"Beautiful patterns, however....","At first glance this book is wonderful- beautiful patterns- clear instuctions. I was excited about using up scraps for some of the patterns. All projects use handspun yarn- wonderful since I am a spinner. BEWARE!!! There are NO yardage requirements for any of the projects period! No weights of finished projects or anything other than your best guess! This is very frustrating for the sweaters (multiple sizes)- who wants to guess, spend all the time knitting then run out of yarn?? Yardage requirements are really a must- as professional designers they should know better. This is definitely NOT a beginner book for this reason- book description is VERY misleading."
3,Great book - for intarsia,"Only buy this book if you are interested in knitting complicated intarsia charts with no row numbers. Some of the projects are attractive, but you will need to buy about eighteen different colors of yarn for them."
2,Yarn Requirements,The yarn requirements are in the very back of the book and are listed in ounces with the standard of 70 yards/ounce. Not terribly easy for beginners. Also most of the patterns are made with very few or only one size.
2,More hand-holding needed...,"I agree with the other ladies....a bit frustrated by this book as I consider myself an intermediate knitter but I still need to know quantities when it comes to buying yarn for a project and numbers on the graphs are a simple thing for the authors to include, one less step for us knitters. This book was a gift, and I am returning it, just not enough inspirational ideas for me. Gonna try something called Holiday Knits."
2,Disappointing,"I was not thrilled with this book. It was recommended by Romantic Times but it didn't work for me at all. Maybe the guy had something of interest but I couldn't see why he was interested in the girl. When people are defined as Rakes, I guess that is my clue not to buy. It won't be of interest to me."
3,disappointing,"Still one of the most literate voices of the genre, but did not meet expectations with this one after her beautifully conceived Illusions. The heroine was not very sympathetic and was not fully developed as a character; she did a better job with Dominic Wyndham but I was hard pressed to see why he was falling in love with Catriona. Still, a welcome change from most of the pulp out there."
5,Excellent little book,"I carry this book and CD with me everywhere! It comes in a compact pleather binder, which makes it convenient to carry with you. The birds are grouped according to color and in order of size, making it very user friendly. The accompanying CD is excellent for identifying calls and songs. It's worth every penny."
1,not very good poor lyric quality,"this music has hype and jump but it is awful they lyrics are very not having to do much with anything they are anoying the music is bad the lyrics are bad it is repetitive and in generally it is a total flop. my question is who in their right mind would buy this album. I hope they are christans, because it sure isen't very apparent by their music I would leave this album. if you want quality go to Dc Talk or sonic flood skip this one. it left me with feeling of regret, spending money for a noisy frisby isent one of my favorite things."
1,sick and wrong,this is sick and wrong. ive made better music with my bottom. corvallis is evil and the w's are satans helpers. may god have mercy on bad music.oh yeah buy my new cd will2kpeace will smith
5,really great cd!!,"i totally reccommend this cd... i know ltos of people that aren't into ska or swing, or anything with words, but they loved this cd... find out for yourself, buy it today!"
5,Great swing music and Christian too! It doesn't get better!!,"I love this cd because it has great swing music, but is talks about how great God is and how uncool the devil is. Even if some of their songs don't make a whole lot of sense, it tells the truth about the devil. The W's are one of the best Christian bands that I have ever heard! I was at the DC Talk Supernatural concert and the W's opened! It was sooo cool! The W's were soooo good! I hope I get to see them again!"
4,I think im in love...,"Wonderful CD... as Mike said up there theyre not ska, they're swing, but they're still very good if you like the style. I went to a DC talk concert, and ended up liking the W's more. The W's broke up in 2000 i think, which was a very very sad day. But good news for all you The W's fans, The lead singer, Andrew Schar, has a new band, called Alpha-Charlie. They're far from famous yet, and their style is a lot different, but they're still awesome. Visit them at www.alpha-charlie.com."
4,better than cherry poppin daddies!,"this cd is quality...if you want a cd to make u happy and get u swingin get this cd! the w's combine upliftin beats with great lyrics that actually mean something(well some of the time) alarm clock, open minded and devil is bad are the most rateable tracks!! theyre better than cherry poppin' daddies so u know they swing and do it in style!"
5,ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!,"All I can say is... THIS IS THE BEST GROUP! My friend and I agree that these guys are just crazy and WE BOTH LOVE THEM! I love the new swing and this just adds, it's nice to have a Christian band that does the same music stuff as the secular groups."
4,Welcomed addition to a lacking genre?,"Let's face it. Most of us can only listen to the big three christian ska bands (Insyderz, Supertones, and Five Iron Frenzy) so much (even though they are the best bands out there). The W's are definitely a welcome addition to a genre that does not have many big names. Most Christian Ska bands are small local products that never get a big break and an entire record deal from a bid label that will put them on the map. That you 5 Minute Walk for putting the W's on tour with Five Iron Frenzy. Now, to the CD. Good songs. Some of them are running through my mind all the time. But, in my pickiness, I've found some just unbearable. I don't know what it is. The songs I do like are great, though. Like I said, it's a welcome addition to a genre that can always use some more big names."
5,The BEST in Christian Swank (Unabridged)...,"The W's have taken the Christian World by storm, and everyone has an opinion on them. Their unique mix of the classic swing beat and their deep driven vocals mixed with the fabulous and trendy sound of ska is both pleasing to the ear, and deeply musical. The musicians show obvious skill and can be likened to the outstanding Ska core group from Denver Colorodo, Five Iron Frenzy. Their vocalist has a similar voice to the extremely talented lead singer of Indigo Swing. Very well made and complete from start to finish. Long live the Swank movement."
5,Kick the devils butt and buy this CD....it's swinging,"I adore this CD! it swings! After buying this CD, you will want to go out and purchase a swing video, cuz you want to invite all your freinds over for a christian swing party! ""the Devil is Bad"" will be stuck in your head and you will whistle it everywhere you go. The W's rawk and so does this CD. get it and enjoy !"
4,"it's awesome, it's swing, everyone loves swing!","I don't know what to say really, I just think it's a really good cd, and everyone should listen to it. If you like swing you'll love it. They rock! I love them to death, they've got awsome lyrics! okay I'm done! :)"
4,Spiffy CD but....,"Well first off I love this CD, but some of its tends to get repetitive. The singing could use a little work. And even though not all the songs arnt chirstian related (since when do they have to be? hehe) its still some good schtuff! ^_^ I strongly recommend buying the CD though personally, I really enjoy it. And if you get to see them on hte DC talk tour go see'im! Its an awesome show!"
4,Swing?,"i love this CDthe guys in the band are awesomei went to a concert with DC Talk Jennifer Knapp and The W's and it was an awesome show i got my tix signed by The W'sthe cool thing was that some girl kept shoving my brother and i out of the way so she could get her ticket signed but then the lead singer, i forgot his name, said "" no hold on they have been waiting for awhile."" then he took our ticket stubs and signed emi will remember that night forever...jk the CD is great i love The Devil is Bad its just an awesome CDso if u dont have it buy it cuz i dont think you'll b seeing these guys on tour ever againpeaceMonica"
5,Why I like the W's,"The W's are a Cristian Swing Band. Some of my friends think I'm wierd (weird?) for listening to swing, but it's cool! Swing is a kind of music that really gets your feet moving, not like some of today's music. They add to the quality of swing by being Christians and having Christian lyrics. I give them 5 stars AND 2 thumbs up!"
2,"Hey horns, it's called a tuner . . .","This album contains some of the worst studio-recorded musicianship I have ever heard. I sure hope they're better live because that's what makes a band. Apparently they're pretty good live from what I've heard from friends and from some of the reviews I've read. And seriously, most people either don't care or don't know when a horn is badly out of tune, so my opinion is just that --- an opinion."
2,"""The Devil Is Bad"" sets the tone","This is a fun CD, with fun songs and good music. So I was very disappointed in the content. There were several words to be found on this album that were totally unneeded, such as ""suck"". Aside from that, several of the songs seemed to glorify violence, albeit humorously, and there were really only maybe four songs on here that you could distingish as Christian. ""The Devil Is Bad,"" the single that did so well on Christian hit radio, really sets the tone for this album - flippant, with seemingly very little thought. If you want a spiritual uplifting, go somewhere else."
1,the w's fourth from the last,"this album was not christian music, except for maybe two songs..ok sounding ska jazzy type sound-but kinda weird lyrics..yeah wouldn't reccomend it if you want a christian album yall."
4,GOOD TUNES,"This is one of the best swing (ska, too) bands today. I normally don't like a lot of Christian bands because many of them are BLAH BLAH. This is a very talented band with a lot of potential. The songs have a nice beat and a rich sound. The lyrics could sometimes become repititous, which caused me to give the W's a four star rating. Very good album!"
4,AWESOME!!!,"The W's are one of the best Christian Bands in the market today. They have very strong swing roots and as you listen to the cd, you will realize that they have potential in ska as well (there are several ska songs in there). I saw them live in Austin the other day and they rocked!! They were even nice enough to personally sell and autograph their merchandise and they played even played the Go Daddy-O song from the Big Bad Voodoo Daddies!! But the only thing I took a star away is because there are too many swing songs and not enough ska songs. Swing is nice, but it can get very annoying after several songs."
5,"Fun rhythm, interesting lyrics - it's got everything.",The W's have put out a great cd. The music is basically ska and it is a blast to listen to. The lyrics are thought-provoking and sometimes funny. I've been listening everytime I get in my car for the past couple weeks!
5,The W's rule,"Not only does their CD rule but their trumpet player charges huge waves on the Oregon Coast every chance he gets!! I have also heard that he was a pretty hot mountain bike racer in his earlier days, traveling all over the Northwest to race with his local crew. These guys are the leaders of the new school Christian-Swing-Ska scene. Get out there and buy their CD!!"
3,"Like ""Stray Cats"" with Christian lyrics","My kids have been real fans of Brian Setzer & Stray Cats, so when I heard this at aerobics class, I had to introduce it to my boys. I agree with other reviewers who think the music quality is less than best, but I'm happy to have God's word/teachings in the music I and my children listen to."
3,Shocker Meets Brainscan,"although this movie came out before shocker and brainscan, it reminds me of those movies. obsessed 80's teen fan of his rock idol plays one of his records backwards and brings the singer back from the dead and he becomes this spirit electrical current on a killing spree, shoots out electricity from his hands, host bodies, makes cars drive without anyone behind the wheel and turns record players, steros & tvs on by the seleves. If you were born in 80's you might enjoy this harmless b movie guest starring ozzy osborne and gene simmons."
3,Ozzy---in a role you won't believe.,"This film is about a kid who idolizes a rock star that ends up dying tragically. He comes back to the living through his record albums. The kid, Eddie is taunted by other students because of his love of heavy metal, but you guessed it, seeks revenge.This is definitely a real cheezy 80s type of movie that didn't scare me in the least. BUT, where else could you see Ozzy play a minister---all perfect and clean cut and Gene Simmons a disc jockey? It was worth it just to see those two.Sometimes I just like to kick back and watch a simple movie and have fun, and if you're into that, this is the film for you. Definitely not an award winning picture..."
5,This deserves to be considered a CLASSIC!!!,The only reason I went to see this movie is Gene Simmons is as equal an actor as musician. I was awestruck by the power felt in this movie and rushed out to get the soundtrack. Can't find the movie or the soundtrack on CD. These are a need for all diehard rock'n'roll'ers.
5,sammy kerr is the man,"re-release this video as it deserves!!!! havent seen this movie since the theaters i always check video stores for years and have never found, please help me on this dilema... a 80's metal fan dave peters"
1,Wow,"This is easily the worst film ever conceived. This is total 80's trash but that alone makes it perfect for some low brow entertainment. A film this bad deserves wacky commentary from the viewers, Ala ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". It's a total winner in that regard. I guess Gene Simmons wasn't winning any Oscars with this role but Ozzy Osbourne's role as a preacher is funny enough because you could still understand him then. You shouldn't have to pay for this dvd, they should pay you instead."
2,Standard '80's teen horror fare,"Not much to be said for ""Trick Or Treat"", really. It's a dumbed-down little artifact that may provide some mindless time killingfor aging baby boomers (nostalgia factor) and 10 year olds. Nota dvd for horror fans as there is absolutely nothing scary orsuspenseful going on here. On the up side, it's not awful as faras '80's teen fodder goes, and is actually a notch or two abovemost of what this genre was offering. There are a few laughs tobe found here and there, not much else."
3,Not quite there...,"This film would have been much better if he actually killed the people who were bullying him. I guess retaliation like that didn't happen back in the 80s. I also didn't like the fact that he sold out his favorite musician and refused to completely obey him.Other than that the movie was pretty cool and kind of scary, containing nice looking special effects for its time.I just wish he would of done Sammy's bidding a little longer."
3,All I wanna know...,"...is: does Dave King (original Fastway vox, now w/ Flogging Molly)sing on this one? I'm a huge Motorhead fan and thusly love Fast Eddie, but I'm not gonna waste my money on an album with a lousy singer (the one that replaced the King). So... is Dave King on it or not????? And don't write movie reviews for a soundtrack, it's annoying und unhelpful (come on Amazon, pay attention!)"
3,"love movie, hated the cover","does anyone else have a problem wit the cover besides me? i love the film and i'm so happy it is finaly in print again, on dvd no less, that is so great. but the cover just realy botherd me. i know what the company was thinking, put ozzy and gene on it and people will buy it more, but what was wrong with the old cover? it was awsome! sammy surrounded by fire, u cant beat that! i know the originaly cover was the reason i first looked at it when i was little. and i wish it had special features, but i'm just glad it's finaly back in print and on dvd."
3,widescreen available!!,"anybody whom is looking for this film in it's 98 min original glory and in widscreenneed to go to ioffer and look up this title. the cover is different(very similar to the vhs)is a fully packed dvd-r(box,cover-art,etc) and well worth the money!"
2,I liked it when I was 12...,"I was a heavy metal fan and a horror fan, but even back then, this movie was a 2 star product at best, except for one shining segment. It's fun to see Ozzy play the reactionary preacher (in 2 tiny cameos), but for me it was all about Genie's hot little headphone scene. I was 12 when that movie came out; what a time."
4,"Enjoyable, brainless fun...:-p","I enjoyed this movie very much. I especially like the song Sammi sings in the gym--good 80's metal...teehee...I saw this when I was a kid and it kinda freaked me out a little with the backwards talk on the record, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Good flick..."
4,If you love the genre- this ones for you,"Trick or Treat is typical of it's genre. If your a fan of the campy fun then this movie is right up your alley.It's hard to come by which makes it even more fun. It is your typical '80's romp through heavy metal and high school as loner ""Ragman"" comes face to face with his rock-n-roll idol- only he's dead.While doing his bidding the bullys learn a lesson and ragman grows up. With Ozzy and Gene Simmons along for the ride you cant afford to miss this classic."
5,One of the 80's most outstanding soundtracks,"Today I started thinking about Fastway after discussing my favorite music with a class I was teaching. It started out with Ozzy then I suddenly had a flash back of Trick or Treat the movie and soundtrack. I used to own the sountrack and rent the movie weekly. I was hoping I could order both, but to my dismay, neither is available. I hope someday soon that they will be available so fans like me who rocked with Fastway in the 80's and new fans will be able to enjoy this excellent piece of work."
5,Awesome Heavy Metal Horror!,"This. Movie. ROCKS! Marc Price (Skippy from Family Ties) is pretty good in this, and Tony Fields does an excellent job as Sammi Curr. I especially loved the cameos by Gene Simmons (From KISS) And Ozzy Osbourne. He had the best cameo as a preacher revealing the evils of Rock 'N' Roll. I had to buy the VHS, though I knew it was also on DVD, but I hear the quality's inferior. I know the VHS quality is equal to the DVD, but it's still a better buy. Anyway, back to the movie, like I said, it's awesome.Highly recommended"
5,This is a great film,"I`ve also been looking fore this film fore almost 10 yers now, and I`m starting to get desperat. i hawe the sound track CD but i WANT the film as well"
3,A good sounding heavy metal band of the 80's!,"The movie was alot of fun to watch which featured Marc Price(The Keaton's neighbor Skippy on ""Family Ties"")who does an energetic performance in the movie. I thought that Fastway did very well with their music for the movie. I really like ""Stand Up."" Other great numbers are ""After Midnight"", ""Get Tough"", ""Don't Stop the Fight"" and the theme song ""Trick Or Treat."" Tony Fields plays the dead rocker Sammi Curr who lipsynchs to the songs. If you have the soundtrack, and haven't seen the movie yet, watch it on Halloween, you'll want to eat it up!"
4,TRICK OR TREAT,"IF YOU LOVE ROCK AND ROLL YOU WILL DEFINATELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.WITH SPECIAL APPEARANCES BY SUCH ROCK AND ROLLERS AS OZZY OSBOURNE AND GENE SIMMONS OF KISS, THIS MOVIE CAN STRIKE AN INTEREST TO AN ALMOST DEAD GENRE."
4,Satanic Music Kills!...,"TRICK OR TREAT captures my youth perfectly, in that just being different was a capital offense! Marc Price plays the heavy metal kid very well, w/ a calm, natural approach. Picked on relentlessly by asinine athletes, he finds his escape in his favorite metal star, Sammi Curr. Alas, his idol dies, leaving Price's character adrift in high school hell. Then, a DJ (Gene Simmons!) gives him a copy of Curr's final, unreleased album! The next thing we know, the record is played backwards, the demon is unleashed, and all is in chaos! TOT is a fun, humorous movie, especially if you had any involvement w/ 80s metal, or were ever an outcast in school. Great stuff..."
5,"FASTWAY, ""SAY WHAT YOU WILL"" ,BUT THIS WAS THE 80'S !","NOW THIS IS AN ALBUM THAT I KNOW MANY OF THE 80'S HEADBANGERS STILL HAVE ! IT ROCKS FROM BEGINNING TO END WITH AN EERIE VIBE THAT FITS THIS GREAT SIGN OF THE TIMES 80'S MOVIE ! I CAME HOME FROM THE ARMY IN DECEMBER OF 1987, GOT DRUNK AND MY BUDDY SAID I'VE GOT TO SEE THIS COOL MOVIE WITH OZZY IN IT ! I LOVED IT ! AND TO THIS DAY IT IS AN ALLTIME FAVORITE ! ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TALK 80'S METAL CAN CONTACT ME."
4,Halloween never sounded so good!,"In 1986, Heavy Metal was on top of the music industry. This was the perfect movie for headbangers. Fastway sings awsome in the soundtrack which is in essence their album. Those of us who wore the denim jacket, the suede boots, the long hair, and showed our devotion with the two-finger salute, we must always, ""STAND UP AND BE COUNTED!!"" This is one for the ages, a definite must have."
5,Awesome!,Please get this tape back in circulation. I can not find it anywhere. The soundtrack and movie are the greatest ever. If you are a metal fan this combo is for you.
5,Trick or Treat,"I love the movie , but had a hard time finding it , found it on Amazon.com , purchased it for a very reasonable price , received it in about a week and a half , love it and have watched it about four times since getting it."
5,Trick or Treat is a cool horror flick,"I've seen this movie the first time on COMCAST on demand & then after viewing it,I've decided to purchase this movie, because it's so cool, especially with two great metal legends of both bands KISS & Black Sabbath Gene Simmons & Ozzy Osbourne who both star in this movie. I must say that I'm very happy with my purchase of the dvd ""Trick or Treat""."
2,"Plenty of tricks, few treats","A typical Hollywood version of a metalhead is bullied. He writes to his favorite singer telling him about it, like he would really care. The guy even went to the same high school. The singer burns in a hotel fire and he is crushed. He was given a tape that when played backwards, tells him how to kill. The movie had a few good speical effects but other then that, this was a lame throw away 80's horror movie. I can remember seeing it at Wal Mart for the longest time in the five dollar bins. Dont let Gene Simmons and Ozzy fool you, they have brief parts. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
4,Seeing Me,"Ok, first off I have seen the movie on tv, and do not have the dvd yet. But I still feel obligated to comment. I love Joy Mohr, Lauren Graham, and Jonathan Davis. I admit J.D. has a very short part, but nonetheless, it was nice to see him in an actual movie.I admit there is nudity, language, drugs, sex, and cheating. But you have to remember that this is only a film. No one in the movie is telling you to emulate what the actor's are doing. If you like any of the three actor's I mentioned, you'll probably like this. If you like humor, sarcasm, and bad predicaments that you would never want to be in, but find funny when they happen to others, you will love this movie. I agree that this is not a romantic comedy. But it is d*mn funny.~Lil' Black Panther~"
3,Well done but not for me,Hongo's poems are lush and full of narrative. I felt the need for more space. The poems are well done: I just needed more song and less story.
5,Very readable scholarly work,"Daughters of Light reveals much about 18th Century society and shows how the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) furthered feminism by allowing and encouraging women from all walks of life to preach, although neither the Quakers of the time nor the book focuses mainly on feminism. These women traveled widely and enjoyed freedom of movement that was unheard of for women of other religions. They also had tremendous spiritual authority. The book is illustrated with specimen letters, excerpts from diaries, and pictures."
4,First Games I purchased 4 my palm,"There are five games, each game is very cool. The first time i downloaded the demos of the pack, i was hooked. I recommend this game pack to any palm game enthusiast..one word of advice....the games look MUCH better in color..i had them in hi-res. 4 my sony...2 bad the sony didn't work after 2 days; but thats not because of the games..."
3,Excellent at clearing water but hand grip isn't optimal,"The double blade on this does a great job, and at certain angles, I can say this is a fantastic squeegee. The problem is that the hand grip doesn't allow us to use this effectively at a number of angles in our shower. The lack of a regular handle limits its' performance, but I do like how little storage space it takes up, standing on end."
5,Great Squeegee,"Works great, no streaks. Handy to store on end. Nice design, looks good in my modern newly remodeled bathroom. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a squeegee."
2,Works OK not great. And grows mildew.,"It works ok on glass, not as well as a regular squeegee. On our irregular shaped (handmade) tile, it works better than a regular squeegy. The biggest pitfall is the growth of mildew in the gaps between the two blades and also into the handle. I suppose if you run it through the dishwasher regularly (like the other reviewer said), then you won't have this problem. Otherwise your beautiful euro-design squeegy will be black with gross mildew in about a year."
5,great resource,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. The whole family is using it now, working on getting a family praise band together. I would love to see an updated version of this, Christian music is constantly giving us new songs of worship and praise. Wonderful book, very easy to use."
2,One Major Omission,"First of all this book has a great collection of songs. It has hard to find, almost forgotten gems from the 70's by Keith Green, The Imperials (remember them?), Larry Norman, Debby Boone (!), Andrae Crouch, etc,. It also has modern songs from Mac Powell (Third Day), Sixpence..., Jars of Clay, DC Talk, Delirious, etc. And it has everything in between like Petra, DeGarmo and Key, Amy Grant, Michael W Smith, Sandi Patty, etc.,The one problem with this book is that it only provides you with the lyrics, guitar chords, and NO piano music. The only notation is one line of melody and that's it. This makes the book great for strumming on a guitar and singing, but if you want a more full accompanyment and vocal parts (tenor, alto, etc.), you need to find another book."
3,This band has an amphibian in its throat,This band is good...but does anyone hear the Toad? They're just not original or it could be that the lead singer is cursed with having a voice quite similar to one of Modern Rock's finest. I need to give it a thorough listening.
2,Not for me,"Vertical Horizon is a talented group, but their music is too generic. My husband is a big fan of their group, but I think their songs sound too much like all the other songs that are out there on the radio."
2,Typifies the bland,"Theoretically this could be a good album. In fact, if you liked the recent outings by Del Amitri, Tal Bachman, and so many other artists you hear on Adult Contemporary radio, you'll probably enjoy it. This album typifies all of that. The problem is, we've heard all of this so many times before. There's nothing here that's groundbreaking. Sure, it was great in 1992 when Del Amitri recorded this album and called it ""Change Everything."" But if I want to hear that album, I'll just put it on, and not this."
1,Terrible.,"This CD I've only listened to once. First of all, all of the songs sound the same. These songs have nothing that stand out at all. To me, they're just songs with no talent. It's guitar, singing, and the songs over. I was really dissapointed."
1,Drivel,"This is not groundbreaking lyrically or musically. Upon initial listen, the potential for something with talent appears to be heard, but then nothing ever happens. The songs are of tired issues and the musicianship is clean but very forgettable. Do not waste money on a ""derivitive"" CD."
3,"Vertical Horizon DO GOOD, BUT.....","Okay...I like Vertical Horizon, their first single the #1 ""Everything You Want"" is a strong anthem song with a beat and hook that won't stop.The only thing that misses is that every song on this CD trys to be ""Everything You Want"" and I feel the CD lacks in some places.I love the lead singers voice, the production quality, etc...and their next single ""You're A God"" is again pop-infection at its best, but with a new group like this who comes out with their first single which is pop anthem at its best, it is hard to top...and most the songs on this CD begin to sound like other versions of ""Everything You Want"", but weaker.I like the CD, I recommend it, great for those long trips, but needs more of an edge....I would like to see a little more variety from a top rate band, with a sound that drives away from ""Everything You Want"".I wish them luck on their sophomore effort."
5,Waited a long time...,"I've waited a long time for another band to come out with such a complete CD. From the first time I listened to this disc, I've loved it. It's one of those discs you can put on and just let it play."
5,Best Live Band Ever,"Vertical Horizon was brought to my attention in September when i saw them play with Train. I went for train, but i was blown away by VH. They play with such power and emotion. I didnt even own this CD at the time, but after the show i bought one from the back. It didnt come out of my CD player until i bought Running on Ice. Then it was replaced by live stages. Then There and Back Again. I have been hooked on these guys and probably will always be. If you get the chance, see them live. If you dont, get all their albums and jam away. Peace and Love to all."
5,Wow.,"I've been an avid follower of Vertical Horizon for almost 9 years now, and I must say that they never cease to amaze me. Their style has changed drastically from the ""There and Back Again"" album, but has grown into something MAGIC! The lyrics on 'Everything You Want' are captivating and mesmerizing, the melodies absolutely stunning. Everything You Want is one CD you will never tire of! These guys deserve ALL our attention, because they are truly talented and in touch with their incredible music! -VHET"
5,This CD is so incredibly good.,"I had never heard of this band before, which is unfourtunate... I listened to it at a music store and had to get it. The lyrics are simple but meaningful, the sound is excellent and sticks in your head. They remind me a little bit of Chalk Farm and Tonic, both wonderful and talented bands, also worth checking out. I'm hoping these guys have a show in the Bay Area sometime soon."
5,"its music, enjoy it","look, this is a great cd. It may not sound like the old VH, but guess what, bands dont owe you a thing. Your still gonna buy the music. So far this albums been compared with every band out there (even Ben Folds Five!, tell me Sean how does a band with all guitars Sound anything like a band with just a kit, a bass, and a piano?). If you like the single ""we are"" you'll appreciate the rest of the album. And if you get a chance see them live. Ignore the whiners."
2,Not Everything I Wanted,"I bought this CD quite a few weeks ago and was greatly dissapointed. I had heard the song ""Everything You Want"" on the radio and liked it. I bought the CD and listened to it.....let's just say I didn't care much for it at all. It's probably just because it really isn't my kind of music.....but even so the songs are pretty generic and redundent. Especially ""You're a God."" I regreat spending money on it. It's my own fault, but I thought I should let some people know so they won't make the same mistake I did."
3,Tough to listen to from beginning to end,"It's a good enough album, but I find that my mind tunes in and out while listening. 'Best I Ever Had' is a well written song, albeit a little cookie-cutter, with good chord progression and use of Maj 7th variations. I agree with some of the reviewers in that the CD is better as a ""garnish""- stick it in your changer, hit random.Very difficult to keep the songs straight- I find myself refering to them as ""Number 2, Number 7"", etc. instead of the song names. This should tell you something.Notwithstanding a tepid review, I would recommend it, but try to preview the songs first to ensure you won't be disappointed."
4,I really love We Are,"Well... the cd is okay.. but the first time i ever heard them on the radio was maybe 3oclock in the morning and i heard We Are, it was so good i turned the radio up so loud i was grounded for 4 weeks and i got permanant damage to one of my eardrums (oops!) its not that bad.. i did learn my lesson though.. ALWAYS BLAST VERTICAL HORIZONS WHENEVER POSSIBLE"
4,the old and the new,"As a long time fan of VH, I was worried about the new album being more ""electric"" and ""poppy"", but through it all this is still a great disc. The thing that saddens me are the comparisons this band is now getting. Third eye blind, eagle eye cherry, and other bands that are fake, superficial, and untalented. VH started out with two guys, two guitars, and two life stories set to music. They have a dedicated following, and I think all of this controversey about the new disc shows how much their music means to everyone. So while I love the old stuff, I also really like the new stuff, a great disc. I must agree with others though that Kieth Kane was missed on this album."
3,ugh...,"when i heard this album i wasn't at all impressed. then I checked out their older albums and i was shocked they were the same band! all the albums before Everything You Want is MUCH better than this. lyrics and instrumentally, this falls short of the amazing talent they had in their earlier work. GO BACK PLEASE!!"
5,I love every track even after 10 years,"Windows Media Player ranks all the songs as 3 stars :((I only listen to a few CD's from the past but this is one of them. Also, my 17 and 22 year old sons LOVE this CD. I also like Weezer from this time frame.GOTTA LISTEN!!!!!"
2,Is that an Airforce Term?,"I loved the first 5 tracks of this CD, but after that, well it's all the same and certainly not worth the price I paid for it! I was very disappointed after hearing their first hits. I would certainly not recommend this CD unless you like hearing something like country over and over. Well, anyway, the first five tracks are okay. Take your chances, it's your money."
5,Call it what it is - their big breakthrough.,"If ""selling out"" and ""abandoning the grassroots"" is how highly talented, immensely listenable bands like Vertical Horzion hit the big time, well, I just wish it'd happen more often. This is, quite simply, beautiful music. There's been so much baggage hung on the whole alternative music, it's refreshing to see a return to the basics of harmonious composition and great singing. There isn't a bad moment anywhere, not one bit of sappiness, annoyance, boredom, insufferability, or any other of the failings that have doomed countless promising albums. In a nutshell, if you love music, this album quite literally has everything you want."
4,A MUST HAVE CD!,"When I heard ""We Are"" on the radio I thought it was REM. When I found out it was Vertical Horizon, the band who sings ""Everything You Want"" I couldn't believe it and had to have the CD. It was a good move. Not only does ""We Are"" sound like REM but so does a majority of the songs! As a fan of REM I would recommend this CD to other fans of REM. I can't wait for their next release. If it's half as good as this release, it will be a great CD too!"
4,A great new album,"The new Vertical Horizon album ""Evrything You Want"" is a nice new addition to mainstream pop/rock radio. The widely heard single ""Everything You Want"" is an amazing piece of work. Other than this, the album still shines. There are many hidden gems, for example, ""You're A God"" in which VH sings ""you're a god and i am not/i just thought that you would know"". The rest of the album shines as well. The upbeat rock tracks are unstoppable while driving and the lyrics won't dissappoint."
5,"Fresh Music, Great Band","This CD is the best music I've heard in a long time, just not a bad song on it. Great acoustic rock with at least 4 or 5 hit songs, should get major airplay. If you like Dave Matthews or if your a Cheap Trick fan try it out."
5,this is an awesome band,"Wow, this CD is great. The music is phenomenol. I heard Everything You Want on the radio, and had to find out the band. Vertical Horizon's music is so good... they're definitely going places. I'd definitely recommend this CD to anyone, no matter your taste in music. Go out and get it!"
3,EYW needs something else,"I don't know why people think that music ""maturity"" equals more electric guitars and more complex production. When I heard VH for the first time playing two acoustic guitars at a rained out show at Duke U, I was pretty blown away by the maturity they showed. Now the awesome chord progressions of songs like ""Life in the City"" and ""Santa"" have made way for the simplistic chord progressions on EYW. As an album, it's not bad, but as a VH album, I must say I was dissapointed. Get off the major label, bring back the mind-blowing acoustic guitar solos, and get back to the songs that matter."
3,"Everything Matt Scannell wants, but catchy nonetheless...","For the past few years, VH has been moving steadily away from the acoustic/folk sound they began with, and toward a harder, rock sound. Every time I see them or hear a new release, I'm stunned by how different it sounds than anything before. It's obvious this album is Matt's work (Keith wrote only 1 song), and it is well-produced, catchy music that will find an easy home on every ""X"" station in the country. Don't expect to find *anything* like ""There and Back Again"" on this one- it sounds like Matchbox 20, Eve 6, Ben Folds Five, and lots of other groups your local ""X"" is playing right now. Acoustic has given way to heavy electric, and harmonies to layered vocal overdubs. The end result is pretty generic alternative rock with some nice hooks. If you own their other albums, you may not like this one, but they'll probably make more than a few new fans with it."
3,How much do you want that ONE song?,"Thrilled with ""Everything You Want"" (the song) I ordered the album... only to be slightly disappointed with the rest of it.It's definately a put-it-in-the-car-and-drive-to-work kind of disc. A little aggressive with the occasional ballad-like cut thrown in for good measure.Well produced with great drum and guitar sounds, there's a certain fresh ""anthem"" feel to ""Everything You Want"" missing from the other tracks on this album.If you like harder adult contemporary this is for you, otherwise stick to the single you love hearing on the radio and wait for the band's next air-play-worthy cut."
3,"great music, terrible lyrics","great music, lyrics are very shallow. this band has potential, try appealing to the older crowd. more grown-up lyrics needed. otherwise, great melodies."
2,not the best,"ok, we're ALL tired of hearing ""Everything You Want"" they play that song every hour on the hour here on the radio stations. so if you like Vertical Horizon, and you liked ""Everything You Want"" when it was popular, then check out #2 ""You're A God"". it's more upbeat, and it talks about a guy liking someone, but the person he liked was so perfect that he thought he wasn't good enough for them, so it was just better for him not to be with them. and i've noticed alot of Vertical Horizon's songs on their newest CD talk about heartbreak. when they make a song that talks about a GOOD relationship, i'll give it a GOOD review."
2,disappointing,"ok i'm not denying that this album has great songs but for god's what's all the great hype about ! there are some songs that are worthy of buying this album, still all the songs have a thing which i hate, the chorus ""IS"" the song, there are few lyrics in one song and it lacks emotion, all they do is keep the rhyming. & they tend to make the chorus words long (like, weeeee arrrrrrre) & repeat that til the song ends or whatever.it's catchy music but you get bored of it too soon, i was taken away with the whole thing i admit & if i wrote this review 2 months ago i would've given it more than 5 stars. if you liked the singles (a lot) then you like the rest of the album, just don't expect too much."
1,What Has Happened to the VH I Once Knew?,"I am a fan of VH's from the old school. Their first 3 albums captivated me and lead me to see them in spectacular live performances several times. Upon hearing their new release, ""Everything You Want"", I was very, very disappointed. It lacks the straight-forwardness and complexity of their previous recordings; in other words, it seems they have begun to mock the awful ""popular"" sound you hear so much on the radio. You think they would have learned from the demise of their friends in Jackopierce. Unfortunately, they didn't and may fall to the same fate...I would think it's for the better at this point."
1,"Derivative, boring pop",Mindless angst-ridden drivel. So vanilla and bland that you end up actually praying for a new album by Third Eye Blind or Matchbox 20. It's that bad. I'm using my copy as a doorstop before I sell it back.
5,Outstanding,"I came to this band late in their career after hearing a cut on the radio- found this CD at Amazon and bought it. I wasn't sure I'd like it, since my tastes usually run toward Steely Dan, Pat Metheny, Pink Floyd, Ambrosia, City Boy. But this recording is outstanding. It is one of the few cd's that I just HAVE to play LOUD! The vocals are impeccable, the lyrics interesting. One minute they're blasting away with power guitars then quickly alternating with incredibly tasteful acoustic work- clearly this band is extremely comfortable with their genre and their music. The production is so perfect it makes those little hairs on the back of your neck stand up! Heartily recommended."
5,THEY WILL BE HUGE,"Vertical Horizon's sound is awesome. Similar bands that come to mind include Third Eye Blind, Barenaked Ladies, and Dave Matthew's. Their songs reach a somewhat frightening realism, expressing the artist's true feeling. These amazing lyrics along with incredible jam sessions combine to form their unique sound. This increases when the band performs live. Buy this CD you will not be disappointed."
4,Heading for the horizon,"Vertical Horizzon's latest CD, eyerthing you want, is great. The guys have done it agian. The new album is a great bridge between alternative and rock. With beautiful words for anyone who is, or has lost in love or life. I give the album 4 stars. There are only 2 things wrong: 1 not that many songs. The other is that after a while you just start to get down on yourself and your life. But neather of those are tha big of a deal beacuse you can feel bad about your love life by watching the news. I would much prefer to listen to this awsome album. A perfect album for all you teenage rocks who have lost at love."
5,Vertical Horizon delivers a splendor on their new album,"I had already heard some of the songs Vertical Horizon (VH) had put out, ""Everything You Want"" being the most popular song. But when I got their new album, ""Everything You Want"" I had no idea it would be this good. Most albums have only a few good tracks and some come up short and disappoint. But not this one. Every song on this album is a hit and it gives the listener a wonderful mix of vibes on every track. VH is one of those rare, truly excellent bands out there now who are devoted to producing some of the best tunes in music. Great vocals and harmonies, superb guitar work, and strong lyrical content make VH a standout in the music field. Not many bands can come close to the splendor VH displays and this album definitely shows that. Don't pass up on this album; it's everything you could want."
4,good cd,"i bought this cd a couple days ago because i had heard ""everything you want"" on the radio and i fell in love with it. the first time i listened to the whole cd, i skipped through most of the middle tracks. they got sort of repetitive and boring. the song that i have listened to over and over again is ""shackled,"" #11. it has a completely different vibe than the rest of the tunes- more rock instead of pop. and there's a different lead vocalist (the guitarist?) anyway, if you're into the pop stuff, you'll like most of the tracks, most of them have radio hit potential. my favorites are tracks #1, #3, #11. enjoy!"
1,from folk-rock to buble gum,"This band has completely sold out to the commercial music industry. The music here is nothing like their early nineties albums that had substance... they're slipping into ""boy band"" status."
4,Im Impressed,Wow.. I had never heard of these guys before and I heard them from my friend and I was blown away.. They are awesome. How come I have never heard about them before! you would think they would be in the Top songs! Definatley buy this cd. its great
5,Everything you could want and more,"OK, everyone I have talked to has listened to this cd and agree with me that its incredible. They're a COMPLETELY different band from their previous cds, but they're also 100% better too. every single song on this cd is great, and i mean that seriously. Its the kindof music you can just put on auto replay and listen to all day long and NEVER get tired of. And the lyrics are absolutely incredible too, none of that nonesense meaningless stuff other people put out. I highly recommend this cd cause its such a great buy because even if you get it just to hear one song you heard on the radio and liked you'll be nicely surprised to find out that every song is just as awesome too."
3,RCA must have did it....,"Like many other reviewers, I, too, was somewhat disappointed by this release. It's as if RCA sent some producer(s) with instructions to create ""x"" type of sound -- with little regard for much but the $$$$. I must say, however, that I am happy for the boys and I truly hope they ""make it"" -- that way they can go back to creating music that doesn't ""sound like"" any other band.....except Vertical Horizon."
2,Ditto the DC guy,"Check the comments of the first guy to review the CD--he's right on. It's not a terrible album--but there are THOUSANDS of ""not terrible"" albums out there. ""Running On Ice"" was one of the best albums ever made. I can handle less acoustic guitar, less creativity, less Keith singing, less Keith writing, fewer slow songs, less variation--but not all at once."
3,Decent CD; decent band,"This is simply a decent CD, no more, no less. It is not a ""classic"" by any means as many amazon.com reviewers would have one believe. There are a few good songs here, ""We Are"" being one of them and the only hard song on the album. ""Everything You Want"" is a great track as are ""Best I Ever Had"" and the last track ""Shackled."" This isn't an album that can be listened to straight through, however. The middle is pretty weak; the songs fail to distinguish themselves and all have the same tempo, negating any highs and lows until the very last song. Buy it if you like the singles and you won't be too disappointed, just remember the majority of the album is rather unoriginal and forgettable."
3,Aim Higher,"I'm in favor of anything that still sounds like rock and roll. This is a good band with a bright future and and album full of instantly appealing songs, somewhat in the Toad the Wet Sprocket mold. (You know, modal, moody, tuneful, punchy etc.) The big problem is that the songs don't withstand repeted listening well. Since this is only rock and roll, let's hope lyrical maturity is somewhere on the horizon. It's just downright lazy to rhyme morning with boring."
4,Great effort by a great group!,"Everything You Want is probably one of the best cd's to grace the rock charts in a long time. A mix of rock/hard rock, with a bit of acoustic folk thrown into the mix. Well written songs, fantastic melodies, and a great cd to own! With awesome tunes like ""We Are"", and ""Everything You Want"". you can't go wrong with this quartet from the East Coast...If you appreciate good rock, this one's for you. Garanteed, there will be a couple ""classics"" from this album."
2,I want the old VH back,"This CD sounds like Matchbox 20 or Third Eye Blind, but I remember the previous CDs in which they sounded like Dave Matthews and Jackopierce. This CD has some good catchy songs, but none are even close to the quality of songs on the albums ""There and Back Again"" or ""Running on Ice"". It seems that on the ""Everything you Want"" album, that Keith Kane is taking the back seat and Matt has taken the driver seat, because all except one song was written by Matt. I don't know what came to them with this cd now they have a full band. I loved it when they were an acoustic duo....so if you like this cd, you should check out the older ones."
5,"Everything you want, and more","I got this CD strictly because I love the first two singles released off of it and thought that I would give it a try. I was totally blown away once I listened to the whole CD. After the first playing, I was hooked. It is shorter than some CD's with only 11 tracks, but the quality of the music makes it an automatic favorite for me. If you like songs by ""No Doubt"", ""Oleander"", and ""Silverchair"", but can't stomach listening to the whole CD's because they are just a bit too hard rock for you......look no further, this is your perfect CD. It is definitely a rock album, but it is somewhere between the above mentioned bands and ""Matchbox 20"", ""Robbie Williams"", and ""Counting Crows"". A bit harder rock than the latter groups, but not overpowering musically or lyrically. If you like ""REM"" or ""Marcy's Playground"", then you will probably love this one. The drums alone keep me playing it over and over again. I have just found my new favorite album!!!!! Try it for yourself."
4,i want to know i question,"my friend told me vertical horizion was a christian band, are they? if they are all the better"
3,*frown*,Wow....This CD does not at all compare to Running on Ice and There and Back Again. Does it have to do with more members of the band? My favorite thing about their music was the impact of the lyrics and the gentle singing but this is too different....it all sounds the same to me! I still love the words but this is just not the same VH.
2,VH changing sound not a winner with all fans,"This new record is exactly the kind of music one hears on the radio. It's fairly catchy, poppy, simple, un-passionate music. For the radio, it's a fine album. But it's a big departure for VH. Matt Scannell and Keith Kane used to share writing responsibilities, but on EYW, Kane has only one song, which in fact is the most passionate and original (""Shackled""). The rest of the record outside of a few nice tunes, ""We Are,"" ""Everything You Want,"" is just Scannell's over produced vocals and lots of electric guitar. Kane's role is diminished as Scannell is the complete front man. if you like VH's older material, this record is not for you. but if you like stuff you hear on the radio which is four chords, repetative lyrics, few harmonies and a lot of electric guitar, this will do you fine."
2,One legendary song and 10 recycled pop radio 'hits'.,"Ok, I must have missed the boat here. This group has talent... but they're not using it. If these guys put their minds to it, they could be a good band. There's only one thing that makes this album worthwhile - the very last song, Shackled... a song worthy of 6 or more stars all in itself (this one song justifies buying the album, even though the rest of it is horrible). If the rest of the album were along those lines, there wouldn't be enough stars on amazon to describe it. The other 10 songs sound like 80's pop guitars with REM vocals... bad combination. I noticed that Shackled was written by the guitarist (Kane, I think), who pulled vocal duty on the song as well. I hope he goes solo, or takes the band over, because the current singer is going absolutely nowhere, considering that he wrote the other 10 songs. Altogether, it wasn't a total waste... but prepare to be disappointed if you're looking for quality alternative music."
4,something different from VH....,"An interesting departure from the mostly acoustic sounds in the 3 previous releases, but overall, I do like the harder, edgier sound on this album (just hope this doesn't mean a complete abandonment of VH's acoustic roots!) I really dig the songs ""Everything You Want"" and ""You're a God."" One reservation though....I definitely miss the shared song-writing efforts of Keith Kane. His voice was sorely missed on this CD and I hope the next effort by VH will be a bit more equanimitous. Also, could do without the goofy Eddie Van Halen-esque guitar riffs on ""Stranded"" which seem a touch contrived and out of place (and which also don't do justice to Matt Scannell's rippin' guitar-playing abilities). Overall, EYW is a great effort and I bet VH's big break is just around the corner......"
4,Are you Everything He Wants?,"Vertical Horizon is a spectacular band that I have been following for the last two years. Over the past two years, I have followed closely in detail each word and guitar chord. The music that Matt Scannell and the rest of Veritcal Horizon express is extremly emotional. The CD ""Everything You Want"" is not only beautifully spun, but also the lyrics are meaningful and give advice within themselves. In each song there are words expressing how ""Love can be so boring, or ""How they remember the girl which leaves them down and lonely."" Vertical Horizon makes their music real and helps you to intensify your listening skills. So, next time you're out and about, don't forget to purchase this amazingly thoughtful CD."
4,A superb effort for VH,"This cd has the depth and meaning that most artists never seem to reach in their careers. Their style and sound is somehow similar to R.E.M. But somehow it leaves you more inspired than R.E.M.The Explosive entry of We Are, sets the cd off right. Then the frustration of You're A God hooks you and makes you want more. That leads right into Everything You Want. If you haven't heard it by now, then you are probably very lucky. It was overplayed, like most songs, but if you look past that then it is a great song about failed romance. The real gem of this cd is next. Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning). The slow sad melodic voice of Matt Scannel. You Say is another great song. Finding Me is another great song that catches the mood. Another favorite of mine is All Of You. It seems to almost catch you off guard but it sounds great.Overall, A great cd that merits a good listen"
3,A few great songs,"Vertical Horizon has created some lovely pop songs here that will linger in the memory, such as ""You're A God,"" which contains some of the most satisfying harmonies I've ever heard, ""Gray Sky Morning,"" which is heartbreaking and pretty, and of course the hit ""Everything You Want,"" which is the standout track. The rest are forgettable, but these are songs to be noticed."
4,Every Song,"I got interested in Vertical Horizon when I heard ""Everything You Want"" and ended up enjoying every song. It is rare when you can find an album like this. It is a definate to buy."
5,Excellent c.d.!!!,"I just got this c.d. today. I've listened to it straight through about 6 times. Every song is good. If you like mellow, alterna-pop (like Goo Goo's, M20,Tonic,etc.)you'll love this c.d. All the songs have great melodies that you'll be singing along with in no time!!!"
4,At times like R.E.M. or Dave Matthews...,"Yes that is one hell of a compliment but its true. These 4 that are Vertical Horizon made a small ripple with their alt-rock track ""We Are"", my favorite track of the album, but the huge success made by the title track ""Everything You Want"" is well deserved. This album is good for the first half, then just drones on. ""You're a God"" has lyrics reminiscent of Days of the New or Alanis Morrisette and ""Everything You Want"" is exceptional. These guys will probably fade away from the spotlight by mid-summer or so but this album sure is a rare gem. Give it a try if you like soft-rock with meaning."
5,Excellent CD!,"Thanks to Amazon and to the many reviews I read, I discovered this great band. I love every single trak of this CD!A mix of rock with some pop melodies in.As already said before, there's no bad song. Incredible.Well done. I am wondering if the other albums are worths buying....any help?Ciao"
5,"Hooks, Grooves - Great Rock and Roll","If there is one thing I love about Vertical Horizon, it is that they are a rock band. Pretty hooks and drum loops (which are plentiful on ""Everything"") aside, they are a guitar, drums and bass rock band with intellegence and that is something you don't find as often in our currently harshly-overproduced world of pop music.VH represents everything that is good about great rock music - terrific singable hooks, solid grooves and well-written songs. The lyrics are introspective without being preachy or doom and gloom and the music ranges from the REM-like verses in ""You Say"" to the clever twisting hooks and 70's power rock bridge of ""All of You."" What is particularly pleasing about ""Everything"" is that VH really delivers on the songs that are not the hits and that is always the mark of a great album."
5,Keepin' the hits coming,"I have a feeling that ""Everything You Want"" will keep cranking out the singles. Vertical Horizon won't need to make a new album for a while. ""You're A God"" followed the title track in becoming one of the best songs on the radio...it's impossible for it to be overplayed. If you like either of these songs, and you haven't already, buy this cd. ""Miracle,"" ""Send it Up,"" and ""You Say"" are all incredibly underrated songs featured on this album. ""Send It Up"" should definitely be their next single after ""You're A God."" By all means, if you are a music fan, you'll love this cd."
5,The best of the year.,"If you enjoyed Robbie Williams THE EGO HAS LANDED album, then you'll love this cd. Sandwiched between the not so good opening and closing tunes are 9 radio friendly, truly memorable, catchy, well-crafted alterna-pop songs. The lyrics are fun and intelligent and you can sing along after one listen... much like you do while hearing EVERYTHING YOU WANT single on the radio. Stand-out tracks are YOU'RE A GOD and FINDING ME. I've managed to turn 20 people on to this album and they tell me it has not left their player for months. At a time when full albums by Filter or Foo Fighters may let pop music fans down because they're a bit too hard (much harder than their radio singles) the VH album is for those who like their rock stars to sing their melodies with a driving, not overwhelming, track. Simply, they rock! And I predict a HUGE future."
1,does not fit,"the description says will fit your 2005 durango, i guess their definition of fit is different than mine. the driver side is too small,and the passenger side is too big.to expensive to ship back so i guess i will live with it :(."
1,One size fits none,"Despite verifying my vehicle year, make, model, & trim and getting confirmation that this product fits my vehicle, this product does not fit my vehicle. Not even close. And the worst part of all is that I've learned that the return shipping cost will be deducted from my refund because its not the seller's fault....so who's fault is it? These floor mats are not custom fitted to your vehicle. These are the same ""buy it and hope it fits"" floor mats that you can pick up at any local auto parts store."
5,The Church Revealed,"Alvin Kuhn presents an extensively researched study of the origins of Christianity in Egyptian and Greek history and of the tragic efforts of the early church to cover up those origins and to adapt the gospels to the ignorance of the people; people made ignorant by the burning of libraries and closing of universities by that same church. Despite the present day trend toward fundalmentism, I think the educated public is ready for the truth, for a faith that is believable, and for a Cristos that is centered in the heart of the individual. Since this book was written in 1943, most of us would have been deprived of its wealth of knowledge concerning this important aspect of our lives had someone not chosen to have it reprinted. The studies by Egyptologist, Gerald Massey, on whose work Kuhn bases much of this treatise, is now also available and is a work of fact and truth supporting Kuhn's revelation of a corrupt church."
5,"A well-researched, balanced portrait of a great First Lady","This well-researched biography of one of our most elegant, accomplished First Ladies will be a good companion volume for any young person or adult studying the tumultuous times in which John F. Kennedy was President. Ms. Brown Agins has woven the fabric of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's life within the context of the era in which she lived and highlighted her skills as a First Lady, a mother, and an editor. Excellent resources, original quotes, intriguing anecdotes, a compelling read."
2,Rhythm errors,"This recording, by a fine pianist very well recorded, is riddled with small rhythmic errors and lurches. It happens especially often just after a trill, as if he had trouble getting his hands back in place. I found it very jarring, and it happens often enough I have to give this a very negative review.Roberts is also not as good as some pianists -- Schiff and Gould for example -- at keeping the separate voices separate. The rhythm errors do not help.The recorded sound is first rate."
3,A pleasant surprise,"Roberts is a pleasent surprise although he does not match the performances of Glenn Gould or Andras Schiff, this certainly is a high quality player! More fun than Hewitt and Janda, he comes in among the top. A recommended listen for those that want an easy to like WTC or have a hard time with Gould's tour-de-force or Schiff's airy phrazing."
4,Exellent craftsmanship,"That is what this recording is about: Excellent craftsmanship. It does everything right, every note in its right place, every tempo and modulation as expected. The sound of the Steinway Grand is presereved beautifully with just the right amount of ambience. Often these works are recorded in churches or big halls and that is not good for the outcome. However, where are the corners, the sharp edges and the humour our highly revered composer has put into his works almost everywhere. Where in this recording is the tempo or a rubato I start questioning, where the other bass line I never heard before. After listening for a while getting used to these findings I might come to the conclusion that this could be another possible way to do it. Finding out these sometimes exciting details can come to a big thrill.There is no thrill in this recording.Bollerman"
4,I Hated Star Trek,...until I read Richard Hanley's book. I read this book while taking Hanley's Philosophy 102 class and it really helped me understand the basic philosophical questions we were tackling. It also helped me understand why people are so obsessed with the Star Trek shows. It reminded me of Sophie's World-both books teach you about philosophy and get you thinking without boring you to death.
5,Great Book for Herpetologists,Knowledge of the often under-studied and overlooked larval stage of the frog- the tadpole- is reviewed excelently in this book. Chapters cover areas from anatomy to ecology.Couldn't recommend this book enough for the herpetologist!
2,Cruciflicks' Review,"""...at around two hours and ten minutes long, this show could've been edited down to about an hour and a half, and it still would've been alright."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""...I should warn you that this is not a film for everyone. It has some very edgy content that will offend many of its viewers....However, all in all, the material was used in a way that drove home the main message the characters were trying to convey. Which was, to put it simply, no matter how far from God you stray, He's always waiting with open arms to welcome you back."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
3,Good story but a little long,"This play had nice elements, but the singing was a bit too much at times, and of course, like most stage plays, a little too dramatic and unrealistic. I did like the premise...the Prodigal Son with a twist. Glad I watched it on BET for free though."
1,Painfully Horrible Play!!!!,"Oh my goodness, this play was the worst stage play I have ever seen in my whole life!!!!! I am so mad that I even wasted my money on it! I think that initially the idea behind it was good and it had potential to be amazing but it was not executed well at ALL! This play was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long! The DVD cover in confusing because the main character IS NOT Robin Givens it's Demetria McKinney's character. This play was so bad I don't even have words to describe how bad it was. Me, my best friend, Pastor and first lady watched this play and they banned me from picking out movies because it was so horrible. Don't waste your money. Youtube it before you waste your money. It probably isn't on Youtube, though because it is so ridiculously terrible! Horrible! No good!!!!"
1,Movie Sucked!,I bought this movie because Demetria McKinney was in; I started watching it and it SUCKED! Will never watch again.
2,Not a good movie!,I did not like this play at all! It seems to fake. I was expecting something more since I read the reviews before purchasing the play. Didn't like it at all!!
4,Church Girl,"good message, good story, good acting.and thats all i have to say! good movie, good stoy, good acting, and thats all i have to say!"
3,Church Girl,I've seen just about every gospel musical out and I have to say this would be one of the worst ever. Sorry!
2,church girl,I have not watched this movie yet. After receiving it I realized that I had seen it on BET. I will watch it soon
1,One of the worst,"I had to force myself to sit and finish the play. When I looked around, I was the only one watching, everyone else fell asleep. Wasted $ on a rental."
5,Truly inspiring!!!,"What a awesome,inspiring and heart warming movie/play.Every God feaing person need to see this DVD.I highly recommend it especially if your over a young women's ministry.Truly awesome!!"
2,"If you love church songs, teather like show and musical this is for U.","So, if you are into musical, theater like show and like church songs. This ""movie"" (It look mmore like a series to me)is for U. It's not bad but I expect something else. I giving this DVD a 2 start because I'm not into this type on movie, but it's ok."
4,Amazing history,"I learned so much about the Cajuns, their origins, their life in Louisiana and the difference between Cajun and Creole."
5,Understanding Other Cultures: Bliss vs. Ignorance,"A succinct, yet information-packed accounting of the Cajun culture in southern Louisiana during a period of incredible change, cultural pressure and ""growing pains"" of a country. In this vast United States how many cultures never ""hit the radar,"" and what a shame. We grow up in a town that we never leave, and we never ""see"" how the rest of the country grew up or lives now; hence, we miss so much.Cajun culture, of course, is as much a part of our American culture as any, and to better understand it enables us to embrace just how diverse and beautiful this Cajun inheritance is.With each new and ever-changing decade of change, Shane Bernard captures those ""key moments in time,"" and allows those mile markers to mark our own lives and to learn from other's experience. The only next best thing is to visit south Louisiana for yourself!Joel LucksLong Island, N.Y."
5,God's Last Message to a Dying World,Great but a little scary because you can see it happening today. Great Allen book as always.
2,Looks great. Doesn't work,"Besides connectivity problems with my T68i and P800, the headset has lousy sound because the pickup mic is too far from your mouth. Street noise easily drowned out anything I was saying. I returned it after a week of trying to get it to work."
4,Nice Headset. But has its problems,I have been using the headset for about 2 weeks. I found very little problems. The battery life could be longer but I chage mine every night and have had no problems. Sound is good for me and I also found that having it on for a long time is not comfortable.I love the fact that there is no wire! There have been so many times where I am in my car and I hit the stupid wire. Anything that reduces the number of wires that I have to untangle is a MAJOR PLUS.
2,I really WISH this was a five-star product...,"But wishing isn't going to make it happen. Ok, it's wireless. I like wireless, but compared to a traditional hands-free device this is not enough to justify the purchase. I found it difficult to use without reading the manual (I hate manuals), it's hard to hear while driving, the battery life sucks, and it's uncomfortable for long periods in the ear. Enough said? Yep."
1,Horrible device,"Does not establish solid connection to phone. After about 4 months, battery life was so poor that I ended up calling tech support. Was never able to get issues resolved and the device is now worthless."
1,it sucks plain and simple,pairing only achieved sporadically and the damn thing refused to turn on even after hours of charging. Then it refused to do anything at all. Thanks for nothing amazon.
1,Didn't like this product,The product takes time to put on. The look wasn't my style. I prefer the baby bjorn.
1,Worthless,"It's funny that I see two reviews that say the book is lousy, and several others that sound like a commercial. So, what's the truth? The truth is this book is little more than a pamphlet hyping the used car biz. It offers very little in terms of specifics. Those reviews praising the book as some sort of godsend were put there by the author. This book is filled with vague and very obvious information. I have found all the information in this book and more on the internet for free. DO NOT BUY!"
1,*WARNING* Buyer Beware *WARNING*,"The reader from Chicago is correct, this book is no good. The reviews from Dallas and Washington D.C. are spam, ignor them. This book contains no insight to the used car business. It is painfully lacking in information. In fact, many chapters that claim to explain how to obtain licensing or info on legalities and such, simply tell you that you should find out how, and not tell you how to get started, or where to look. This book is a joke. Its filled with the most basic typographical errors and sub-par graphics. Its almost funny. Oh well, you were warned."
3,TOW TRUCK DRIVER GETTING IT DONE,I have been in the towing business for 13 years and one of thefew perks would be the chance to buy and sell used cars.I try to buy at least one or two a month to pick up an extra$1500 or so. For me The Used car Money Machine was reallyhelpful. At least it made me aware if I can find two barginsthan why not 3 or four. Bargins are out there every day and youdo not need to be an insider to make money. Don'y listen to thehaters out there the book is well worth $13.00! A lot of moneyis made with used cars but it does take some work. Just buyinga diet book wont make you skinny you gotta be into it.
1,The Used Car Book that Makes Money...Machine,"I found by reading this book that the secret to making money is not necessarily in selling used cars, but rather in making crummy books that get one's $13 dollars to help make yourself rich. This book is horrible! Like other reviewers, this book tells you over and over that if you buy something at a low price and sell it at a higher price, then you will make money. Like Duh! However, it is very short on specifics and content. Some of the explanations are mere elementary concepts. This author could have benefited from a creative writing class, as the grammar, layout, and presentation are terrible. Buy this book if you want to waste $13 dollars, a couple of hours of reading, and don't care to learn anything that you wouldn't have figured out yourself with free info."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!,"I cant believe that I actually paid for this book. Anyone with a brain knows that if you buy low and sell high, you will make money. If you know that then you dont need this book. This book is silly. I cant believe that it was even printed."
1,Like a nothing down program: all hype / doesn't deliver,"This book basically gives the advice of buy low and sell high. The only 'tricks' it will give you is that, if you hunt down deals, you can sell at a profit. DUH! More than half the pages in this book are talking about how great buying and selling used cars is, rather than giving the reader any sort of information at all. The rest of the book is just examples of how if you buy a car for $10 and sell it for $100 you've made 1000% ROI. The only money machine I see is the hype this book is getting as being a great source of info, which it isn't."
1,Not firm enough nor durable,"Although this body briefer IS soft and comfortable, it does NOT provide the ""firm control"" it claims. In addition, after washing and wearing for a month or so I was appalled to see it splitting and eventually tearing at the seams - and I actually purchsed this in a slightly larger size, so there was no reason for it to fall apart so quickly."
2,Splitting at the seams!,"I bought this slimmer (appropriate size for size 14) to see if it was more comfortable than the others I had bought in the past. It is not FIRM control, and the fabric, while comfortable, is pretty thin. After two washings (hang-to-dry, not heat dried), this slimmer started splitting at the seams. It looks like I have had this for 10 years! Needless to say, the control is gone after 2 months, and I'm having to buy another product to replace this one."
3,Good & Bad,"I just received this item.Pros: I was pleased with the feel of the material as well as the firm control it offers. The bra portion provides good support and a pleasing shape.Cons: I am not a tall or long-bodied person. However the straps seem to bunch up in front and dig into my shoulders until it becomes too painful to wear, even after letting the straps out as much as possible. I will not purchase this again until they do something to fix the straps and perhaps consider making body briefers in tall, average, and short lengths. I'm going back to Bali!"
3,shaper,"Wore this style for years but discovered that the underwire gets mishapen and does not hold up too well. Also, the strap are not as comfortable as others."
1,very poor material on the back of body shaper,"the materials used on the back of this body shaper must have been made of butter, because if I could show you how bad it is now to the point that it cannot be worn any longer. The second one that was sent to me as a replacement is already falling apart like the first one.This item should not be sold to anyone anymore. Two years ago I purchesed a ""BALY EASY ON "" is still like newFlexees Women's 360 Degrees of Slimming Firm Control Body Briefer with Flex-to-Fit Cups #5456"
1,Runs Very Small,You need to order up a few sizes because it runs very small. Was very shocked at how small it was. 40DD much smaller than a 36D in another style body briefer.
4,Engaging Story,"Anyone interested in Japanese antiques, history or culture will want to read National Treasure. While the story revolves around Japanese swords and the people drawn to them, Dr. Bleed fills in the historical and cultural background, and introduces details about swords in a way that makes National Treasure accessible and fun reading for anyone. Collectors will really identify with the current events and familiar characters. I can't remember the last time I stayed up this late to finish a novel - Good stuff!"
3,Not as good as I expected,"I watched a number of videos by Yogi raj and was very impressed by his knowledge and understanding of the gurus and his ability to transpose the various key aspects of religions and to find a common ground and explain the universality of all of them.But this but falls much short of my expectations, there are some pages that are brilliant however some that really fell short of my expectations.I expected a book of a caliber of ""Autobiodraphy of a Yogi"" however this fell well short of it. But I am still very intereted in Yogiraj and think he is a realized soud but that does not shine in this book...maybe it was ghost written."
2,Too much ego,"I enjoyed this book - the cover's mountain scenery, a review of raja yoga, and the rendering of experience to poetry. But many chapters close with boasting, hardly contained. And that contradicts the overall message, surrender of ego to embrace the divine. Then there was the author's YouTube statement that Babaji is ""der feurer"" which is to say ""the leader."" But why that choice of words? Freudian slip? A cultural thing? Is it that the Indian culture is more deferential to authority than the American? What seems harsh or even wacko to me, might be nothing to someone else."
4,Lego Big Rig,"This Lego set is lots of fun to put together, and has easy to follow instructions. It is even fun to play with after assembly."
5,Beatiful and detailed,"Personally, I think that this is one of my favorite sets (I'm planning on buying the make & create eiffel tower though). That's not just because there's three models to build (whoa!), but because all of the models are well designed and are very detailed. Most of them have movable parts, such as doors, hoods, and mirrors, and their all easy enough to build.WONDERFUL!!!"
4,Superb stuff,"An excellent guide to a challenging series. The best bit is an A-Z of all the names, places and concepts. I learned a lot about Blake, CS Lewis and other people Pullman is influenced by. This is a very readable guide, and could also be useful for anyone writing a paper on the His Dark Materials books."
5,"A well done guide to the persons, places, and references of Philip Pullman's Dark Materials","If you're weak on your Milton, Blake, Lewis, and Elliot, this will help out with the references. It's a fun read, or a useful reference, your choice. Lance Parkins is best known for his work, fiction and non-fiction, involving Dr. Who. Mark Jones I hadn't known anything about before seeing this book, but he seems to be a well-known writer of guidebooks and online materials."
3,more artists' way,"not really any new stuff here. all from artists way as best I can determine but having it in handy pocket size is good to have during times of waiting in doctor's office, lines, etc."
1,Kindle users beware!,"I accidentally bought this book. I was trying to buy the regular book, and I downloaded the preview (two pages), and this book looked right. And for roughly 6 dollars seemed right for a full book, and it has all these stellar reviews. Must be the real book. What a deal!No, it isn't. This is a 100 page summary of the real book, with a few mantras at the end.Just make sure this is really what you want. It most likely isn't."
1,Don't work on xbox 360 hd-dvd players,"Alert! Owners of 360 players: don't buy this hd-dvd, because don't work."
2,Buyers Beware!,This HD-DVD does not work on the Xbox 360 add-on. This is among the many discs that are unreadable and nothing tells you this beforehand.
3,"Its not the disc, its your player","Interesting how you both have Toshibas. You need to call Toshiba so they can send you a software upgrade. They will send the upgrade on a disc. Unfortunately, you will have to call them in order for them to send it to you. They don't notify their customers that the equipment they bought is out of date with current formats.I doubt National Geographic will be sued....Its not the disc, its your player.Oh - the DVD is awesome. You basically watch lions kill and eat large animals in HD, hopefully on a giant TV. Good luck."
5,Amazing cinematography and narration!,"The first true nature documentary to be released on HD formats and, boy, is it excellent!This is a 90-minute documentary on a pride of lions and their buffalo prey trapped on an island in the Okavango delta. There is an extrememly informative narrative throughout the whole program with some fascinating moments.The picture is truly amazing in HD. You can see every hair on the lion's mane, every fly buzzing around a buffalo, and every blade of grass concealing the hunters. Incredible.The sound is an achievement, too. You've got to have surround sound for this. The bellows of the lions, the grunts of the buffalo, and the laughs of the hyenas surround you and immerse you in Africa completely!And the narration by Jeremy Irons is worth the price alone.If you have a Blu-ray player, this is a must-buy! I absolutely loved it!"
4,Classic wild Life adventure,"Its reality that one cannot imagine,wild life at your door step at the highest quality.the efort put behind by the people who have recorded this film is truely great."
4,HD-DVD version playeed fine on my A2,I just received this HD-DVD and it played on my A2 with NO problems.PQ is not the best I've seen so far but AQ was good. Overall my daughter and I enjoyed watching it. I have the firmware v2.5 for this player.Richard
4,National Geographic Relentless Enemies,the subject material I would give an 9 out of 10the picture - 8the sound - 9
1,It will not play.,"I used a mail order rental service to get this movie and it wouldn't play on my xbox 360 HD-DVD player. I thought it was because of scratches, but I recently purchased it from Amazon and even a brand new disc doesn't play. It's nothing more than a worthless coaster to me."
1,Relentless Enemies,I've actually had Netflix send me this twice and neither disc would play on my Toshiba HD DVD player. I thought it might be just screwed up rental disks but obviously there is a manufacturing problem with a large number of these if the number of reviewers who say they don't play is representative of the larger user base.
5,Breath Taking,"This Blu-ray is a perfect example of why Hi Def is so necessary and loved. I am a fan of National Geographics documentarys for all the obvious reasons. They give nature its due. The content is top notch and pulls you in the minute it begins. The laws of nature will amaze you at the very least and to have them filmed up close and personal like this and in this format puts you in the middle of it all as if you were there and walking among Gods creations as an observer un-noticed. If you are a fan of nature films and National Geographic, this is a must have."
1,Still Doesn't Work With XBox360 HDDVD Add On,"I'm very disapointed with this HDDVD. Despite it being released in March, it still does not work with the XBox 360 HDDVD player. Reguardless who's fault that is does not matter, this is unexceptable to me. If you plan on buying this and watching it on the Xbox 360 HDDVD player, stay away. This was released in March of this year, so I doubt the 2 will ever be compatible together at this point."
1,Does not play.,I purchased at BB. Does not play on the 360 HD Player. Returned for second one that does not works. Will be returning for money back.
2,Misleading Title,"I bought this Blu-ray disc hoping to see what the title suggested: ""Relentless Enemies"" [of the nature world]. It turns out it is not really that topic. It is only about lions and buffalo for the whole documentary. In a way, could the title be misleading so that the customers will buy it, because if the title had been ""Lions, the Relentless Enemies of Buffalo"" or ""Relentless Enemies -- between Lions and Buffalo"", I think less people will buy it.So buy this only if you don't mind watching lion vs baffalo for the whole documentary. As a comparison, the program Galapagos by BBC for about the same price is a steal."
3,Expectations,"Great video, but I misunderstood. I thought it was a film about other animals, not just solely focused on the lions and the buffalos. Good video, though."
1,It doesn't work.,"It does not work on my Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive (though I am connected to Xbox live for updates). I'm in Germany with a German 360 and all, but judging from the other comments, that does not seem to be the issue. (There's no region-coding with HD-DVD so that's not the problem either.)Very disappointing after all those weeks of waiting for the package."
2,Documentary cheese,"We watched this after being spoiled by the beautifully filmed and narrated Planet Earth (BBC) and unfortunately this doesn't even come close :-(The narration is uninspired and full of anthropomorphic blunders, the editing leaves something to be desired with it's TV soap-style ""dramatic"" cuts here and there and the slow motion segments are all done in post production.Quite a let-down, really."
1,drcakmur,"How can someone mess up such a great documentary film in such a way?? I hope National Geographic does something about it and we can buy it again...I tried on couple of different HD DVD players and no luck with anyone of them... Such a shame and I can't understand why National Geographic does not react, it is their reputation at stake???"
3,Too long for one subject only,"The images are great, there's a three-lion fight impressive and it's interesting and well done as most NatGeo films, but... After 20-25 minutes you've had enough of so much of the same."
1,Doesn't even work. HUGE disappointment.,"Like most people on here, I cannot even get the disk to start playing in my HD-A2. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Horrible. Will NOT work.,The HD DVD will not play in any HD DVD players. This is a scam or something. STAY AWAY.
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,This DVD DOES NOT WORK in an HD DVD player - or any other player. I ordered 2 sets and neither of them work. Expensive to ship back to get refund so beware.
1,"Lions stick to Buffalos like flies to, you know.","It was a good document but i don't like the fact when the Lions act calm and resting next to the Buffalos acting like good neighbors only when they not hungry.Buffalos are sick of Lions ,they figure Lions need to get a life or hunt something else.My favorite scene was the battle of 2 male Lions against one male Lion,that was cool,braveheart."
4,What a great story,"Even though this piece doesn't have the same cinematography as planet earth, it is a much more interesting story.This is one thing national Geographic has always been great at: creating a great story, using fantastic narratives to incorporate the audience into their world.Never have I ever watched a documentary so well told and the interaction of the pride of lions with the herd of buffalo is so interesting, it is definitely a must-watch."
4,"Picture is good, but not good enough","My Toshiba A20 can play this HD DVD. Everything is good, but picture quality is not as good as Planet Earth.Anyway, I like it and rate it by 4/5."
2,Nothing to loose if you don't have it in HD,"This is actually my fist HD DVD from National Geographic and to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed in general. The good thing is I didn't face any problem playing the disk in my player, as reported by some others. The storyline is okay but I found it's kinda boring sometimes. If you think about HD, the PQ is not up to the standard in my opinion. Most of time it's actually hardly distinguishable from the standard definition version. The close-up scenes are okay but the long shots are as blurry as 90's movies. Night scenes are grainy but not so bad that you will feel like skipping the chapter. The gap between two chapters could be shorter as well. So, in the end, if you already have it in SD, then HD not really worth it. And if you can't afford to buy or can't get it for any reason, as I said, you not gonna loose anything that you will ever regret."
3,"Great, but only if you don't have Planet Earth","I gave it 3 stars, it might be just me, Since I have Planet Earth. Don't get me wrong, it is a great disc to have. Great Pictures. But I have Planet Earth in HD whose contents defenetly outproformed this Disc. In this disc, it only has Lions and Bufflos battles. I have seen other reviews. Some say that they have problem reading the disc. Nothing wrong with mine copy for sure. I have Toshiba HD A-30. Again great picture and great discount price (Bought BOGO Deal) Thanks Amazon."
1,"Won't play on Toshiba SLI3, either...","I'd hoped I'd be immune to the problems listed about not being able to view this HD DVD on certain players, since it was bought MANY months after some of the complaints. I purchased the X205 Toshiba laptop with the Super HD DVD and I get error messages: Prepare This Blank Disc or Restart Computer, when I insert the movie.Does ANYONE have a fix--Toshiba is of NO help!!!"
3,Doesn't play on xbox 360 either?,"My Xbox 360 add-on says ""Cannot read disk"" and it is connected to xbox live and has all the updates.Don't think it is the players, but rather the disks have issues.Waiting for a replacement disk now."
1,bad hd-dvd,this movie is expencive and doesn't play in the xbox 360 hd-dvd add-on even with all the updates
1,What gives?,"Like the other reviewers of this product, I was highly anticipating a great documentary in HD.Sadly, this disk will absolutely not play on the Xbox360 HD-DVD player.Avoid at all costs until National Geographic pull the whole production run and replace the disks with a working version."
4,Glad to have the single,"I'm glad to have the CD-single, because I really like (and wanted) the instrumental version of Cantaloop. It's interesting to hear the ""Flip Fantasia"" version, but the instrumental is the only one I'll play a lot (or put on home mix CDs, rip to MP3, etc.)For those who like the jazzy style, the instrumental Cantaloop is HOT! Blending the jazz with sort of a quasi rap/hip-hop (and I guess I'm not cool enough to understand the difference!), ""Flip Fantasia"" is pretty daggone good too, but I'm just not much into that flavor of music.What I have learned is that the rest of US3's music is that blended style, and therefore that the one instrumental version of Cantaloop is all the US3 that I would find worth buying, so the single is it for me. I'm glad to have gotten it for a low price, rather than paying much more."
5,Cute and funny story,"I have this movie on vhs, but would like to see it on dvd. I'v watched it so often that I've worn out one vhs already. I watch it whenever I need to laugh."
4,Just Great Fun,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies. Implausible? Of course. But it's unmatched for sheer escapism and charm. If you liked Jumpin' Jack Flash, 9 to 5, and Romancing the Stone, you'll like this one. Like those movies, though, this one depends a great deal on the charm of its lead actress, so if you don't care for Jo Beth Williams, it will leave you cold. It clips along fast, and while it's rarely laugh out loud funny, it's always pleasant enough to make you smile."
5,Simply great entertainment.,This is great entertainment.I have been looking for a DVD version for several years.It is only a bit dated but you will enjoy watching it many times.
5,Screwball delight,"Granted, I've watched Tom Conti in anything I could find ever since The Norman Conquests million of years ago. However, this is an uber-favorite to which I return frequently. It's a special and rare film that holds my interest over this many viewings: The Philadelphia Story is another that comes to mind. Kick back, suspend disbelief, and enjoy yourself with this one. Herewith another vote for DVD format for when my two VHS copies finally disintegrate."
4,"I loved this movie and need to find it on DVD, any hope??",Tom Conti is wonderful in this movie (and equally wonderful in Shirley Valentine). Where can I find these movies on DVD?
5,Finally! Buy this movie!,I am so excited to find American Dreamer on DVD. I have been quoting from it since it came out. So much fun! Just a great light movie. You will love it!
5,A Sense of the Ridiculous,"I can only imagine the pro reviewers read a blurb instead of watching the movie. Too bad for them!It left me gasping for breath as I laughed myself senseless. JoBeth, I love you and the same for Tom Conti. If the three stooges were literate they would've made this movie."
4,a favorite romantic comedy,This rates among my favorite light comedies of all time. Too bad it isn't available in DVD! Tom Conti and JoBeth Williams are fun together!
4,American Dreamer - an oldie but goodie,"It's dated, but a fun-loving, action packed romantic comedy. The actors seem to have fun with their roles and overall it continues to entertain. Safe for the whole family~!"
4,American Dreamer,"This is a sweet story of a women traped in a marriage with a husband who really just doesn't support or understand. She enters a writing contest and wins a trip to Paris, and he tells her she can't go, she does anyway, and comedy ensues."
5,American Dreamer,I loved this video too. I'm always checking to see if it has been reissued in DVD or VHS. There are some pretty bad video/dvd remakes why are they not reissuing this one?Wendy
4,Love this movie,"I've loved this movie since it was in the theatres, but most people have never even heard of it. It is a comedy with a bit of mystery thrown in."
5,Another vote for a DVD release,I just can't get enough of this movie! I watch it any time I want to feel really good.
4,Love American Dreamer,"My wife and I saw this film when it first came out in the early 80's. And sure, it now seems a bit dated and the script is all kinds of schmaltzy. But the film is a winner because the two stars perform so well together, the Paris scenery is so wonderful and like all romantic comedies, it delivers a satisfyingly happy ending."
4,An oddball romantic comedy,"""American Dreamer"" is one of my wife's favorite movies. She's seen it time and again and finally convinced me to sit down and watch it with her. I'm glad she did. It's an oddball sort of silly romp through Paris with JoBeth Williams and Tom Conti that gave me some chuckles and a few laughs. I was reminded of another movie I saw a long time ago called ""Romancing the Stone"" with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to be entertained for one and one half hours...it's a pleasant way to spend your time."
3,CUTE CHIC FLICK,mY WIFE LOVES THIS MOVIE WHILE i WAS BARELY AMUSED. AGAIN A GOOD CHICK FLICK FOR A RAINIE DAY.wHEN THEY PAY ME TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE i WILL WRITE MORE
3,"Nice product, a little short of feature expectations","I too use DbNow to track wines. I have over 1000 bottles in my wine cellar and use my Palm to track my wine. In the database I have many fields describing the wine from its location in my cellar, the varietal, the vintage, its maturity etc.. In order to choose wines to drink I need to sort the data many different ways. I've found the limitation of 6 stored sorts to very constrictive. It means I most often have to manually re-enter sort criteria which is a little cumbersome. Other than that limitation, everything else works great. If you don't require more than 6 ways to sort your data I'd highly recommend this software."
1,DB now is awkward at best,"DB now, just is not worth the hassle for the minimal gains you get from it. Because it is a database, and a database only, you still have to use the palm software for all your time management: alarms, to do's etc. So now instead of just going to one place on your dektop to backup and merge files you must now go to two places on your drktop -- hence two seperate backups to two seperate softwares every single time. WHAT A PAIN!!! This is partly due to the inharently bad communication between the Palm Platform, and the windows platform. You could say that if your desk top were a large storage closet, then your Palm Piolet would at best be a small odds-n-ends drawer. You just can't take the large closet full of stuff and fit it into the small odds-n-ends drawer without loosing all the ""good Stuff"". The palm piolet is what it is, and DBnow software just does not add any real significant benefits to your Palm PDA."
3,Good. Fairly good....,"I find it hard to really get into this mix. I've listened to it over and over again and never really fell in love with this mix. The first CD is kind of slow. The 2nd and 3rd CD's are a little better/ harder. But, overall this is not as good as the Direct or Summer Sound CD's from the Godskitchen series. If you skip this one don't worry...cause you won't be missing out on much!"
4,Good toe tapper,"I bought the album at a CSI show because I loved the last one so much. If you are expecting the same music, you are going to be alittle disappointed but if you take the album on its own merit, then its very listenable. Hasn't left my car player in three days. The guys are really nice and personable, even got a couple of hugs at the end of the night. I really appreciated them putting on a good show even for alot of casual onlookers and less than fifteen really interested individuals. SEE them live...they are fun and get up and dance folks...its the only way to enjoy their show!"
4,elvis #1,"received order, was very pleased with it, came in good time, discs in good shape, didnt charge an arm and leg for P&H"
3,Nice,"Is nice to have a good selection of Elvis romantic songs together, the CD one is a lot better than the second one, but still happy with the product."
5,"Elvis, love songs","This collection of fifty of the greatest Elvis love songs is responsible for generating memories of times past when we were young teenagers. Eventually, the music will take the listener back to a place where feelings were described."
3,oone out of two aint bad,I would rate this at 31/2 stars but i cant so i went with 3. The reason is that CD 2 is excellent and has really good picks and flows very nicely. I play this CD alot at work(massage therapist)and i get very favorable comments. If this was a review on this CD it would be a 5 i really love this CD. Things fall apart with the first CD. It doesnt flow but worst of all it picks some lame songs like Rags to Riches. Come on this was never an Elvis hit and is a lousy cut. someone fell asleep at the mixing board.Being a BIG Elvis fan i expected more but like i said the 2cd CD is great so pick it up used and enjoy.
5,Some things........,"Purists may disparage this collection, but we find it is the most often selected for those moments when both easy listinging and only Elvis will do; Now even the kids sing along with daddy's cornball Elvis impersonation.Included here is a selection of Elvis's early years, cheesy film years, and glam-tacky Vegas years. In all, the complete arc of the man and his voice. Of course we could do without the the horror of the backing vocals of the Jordainaires, but no matter, Elvis shines through.A great selection of the LOVE songs that Elvis sang that, cheesy or touching, you most want. Since more than a few selections are simultaneously both, get it today."
5,He still melts my butter,"I love the song Suspicion. I always here the version by Terry Stafford and I just learned who he was today. However, I have been a true fan of Elvis Presley. I grew up on Elvis. I remembered when he died I was was only 12 Years old.I was in tears and I still have a problem watching Love Me Tender. Because it brings tears to my eyes. However, I just check out Elvis version and I have to say this I had to buy Elvis song because it felt real. Elvis if you are listing to me. I love you."
4,Great CD,I gave this 4 stars because Old Shep was included in this CD for some strange reason. If you like Elvis you'll love this CD.
5,An Excellent Documentary on Meth Addiction,"Saving Carren is an excellent Documentary on Meth Addiction. It details the power of addiction, addiction's impact on society and the devastating toll meth addiction has on our young people and their families. Saving Carren provides us with education about addiction and also offers us hope about addiction treatment and rebuilding the lives of people devastated by the disease of addiction."
5,This one's worth your while,"Savin Carren is at it's core a pretty simple movie. Girl gets mad at parents and finds herself caught up in the world of meth addiction and prostitution. We think we've all heard it a million times before. But this story takes place in rural America where we all think our kids are safe from all of that. This story is of a loving family that in the blink of an eye, with no real warning tumbled into disarray that they are still piecing back to together today, many years later.I saw this movie paired with a Q&A; with Carren and her father along with local drug enforcement officials. The bottom line is that this stuff is in YOUR neighborhoods and quite possibly in your home. You and your kids need to watch this movie to understand what to look for and what to do."
4,Inductive,"Solo works tend to be personal for the composer, the performer, and the listener. This album allows its listener to get into the minds of some of the greatest musical geniuses of 20th century. Wolfgang Boettcher takes on a unique approach to the selections and his style is very clean. Every note gets a chance to make it to the listeners ear- something that is often forgot about by many performers. When all of these elements come together in a single album, it is worth listening to."
2,Timoleon Vieta Come Home: A Maudlin Journey,"What a depressing book. I didn't hate - surprisingly enough. It just seemed to be a book of one sad thing after another, loosely tied together by the presence of the dog. There was just nothing uplifting whatsoever about the entire book. And what type of man trades in his dog in exchange for a once-a-week sexual favor?! It was just a sad, depressing little book, but, I must admit, it did hold my interest (though mostly I felt like I was waiting for something good to FINALLY happen...) and it certainly drew out emotions (melancholic emotions). The more I think about it, the less I like it, actually... It really did not contain anything positive whatsoever."
1,Bitter disappointment,"I love books and am guilty of reading many of them because they were recommended by friends or by book reviewers. This one was recommended in a book review, and I wish I'd skipped both. The stories of the individuals with whom Timoleon, the titular subject, crosses paths, are sympathetically described, but there is not enough about them or their futures to be satisfying. And Timoleon's fate is just too heartbreaking for an animal lover. Skip this book if you are at all tender-hearted."
1,Killing a dog is a Sentimental Journey???,The author must be smoking crack to see killing a dog so brutelly is a sentimental journey! In fact if he were standing here right now I would throw this book at him. That's how much I hated the ending of this book! How sad to use animal abuse in this way.
1,timoleon vieta com home,This book sucks. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The main character is a jerk and is easily manipulated. There is certainly nothing sentimental about the journey. I wish I had never read the thing because it is so disturbing I will have trouble getting it out of my mind.
1,Devastatingly Cruel Book,"Few times have any book brought such a strong reaction. The ending is like having your best friend pull out a gun and shoot you in the face. As one other reviewer said, life can be brutal but to spend money and be fooled into thinking this is ""dog"" book is downright dishonest. I also failed to see any humor in this book--only cruelty and dispair.Please do NOT read this book if you love dogs--you'll be bereft as I -- it will be a long time before I forget the images in the last chapter."
1,Bitterly disappointed,"This book was truly the biggest scam I have ever read...tossed it in the trash immediately afterwards. The promo for the book makes you think it's a nice bittersweet story about an abandoned dog and his weak-minded owner. Makes you hope for redeption somewhere along the line. Then you get the ultimate shock at the end when the dog is the victim of senseless cruelty. Quite a con job getting animal lovers to read this book when it will only upset them. Also, a zillion typos. Save your $, don't buy this book."
1,A small slice of evil,"By having the dog Timoleon Vieta brutally and senselessly killed, the author of this book has added to the world's supply of evil in a small but palpable way. I have never been so bitterly disappointed and angered by the ending of a book. I immediately threw the loathsome item into the garbage, an act that somehow seems too good for it. Perhaps I'll dig it out and, when I take my own dog for a walk tonight, I'll get him to do his business on it. Now THAT seems more fitting."
3,A Modern Tragedy,"First things first: Simply because this book has a dog on the cover, does not mean it is going to have a happy ending. Don't get me wrong, I am a passionate animal lover, but this is a novel, not Dan Rhodes encouraging animal cruelty. Now that we have that out of the way, it should be noted that this is an emotionally taxing novel. It should also be noted that this catharsis is not such a bad thing, or something to avoid.Literature can put us in touch with our deeper emotions, and show us the different situations that arouse them - both of which this book does very effectively. Life is not a picnic, and the pieces don't always add up - Rhodes' writing makes that much clear.My only quip with Rhodes' book is the way in which he delivered the ending. It seemed rather blunt and hasty. Otherwise, it was a well written novel."
3,"Well-written, but brutal","Deceptively horrible in worldview, but a clever novel-in-stories. He makes a strong case for the world being composed solely of hope, its cruel disappointment, and the triumph of the weak. If you are in the mood for this sort of thing, and, in particular, for a terribly depressing finish, jump right in. Dog lovers, especially, should be wary."
2,high hopes,"Mr. Rhodes--chocolate is horrible for dogs; essentially poisonous. Throughout the book, the dog is repeatedly rewarded with chocolate. Why?I wanted to like this book. The dog was loveable, but his 'master,' Cockroft, was such a despicable character, I nearly put the book down before I was halfway through. Cockrofts sexual escapades and thoughts reflecting his low self esteem take precedence over anything else. Timoleon Vieta's journeys away from his master give the reader glimpses into the lives of others--some of these allowed me to continue reading, hoping for something to tie it all in. But all in all the book left me unfulfilled and irritated with the ending."
1,This Book Infuriated Me,"A sentimental journey to what??? Fury? Anger? Incomprehension? The only reason I kept reading after the first half of the book was in the hopes that Timoleon Vieta would find someone better to love and care for him than Cockroft. Then I got sucked in by the poignant stories of the people he encountered on his ill-advised trip home. Just when I was starting to feel better about the book, it ended abruptly, violently and with me throwing the book across the room and refusing to touch it again (I made my husband put it in the trash for me). I, too, am an animal lover and hate the ending for that reason, like many of the other reviewers. This does not, however, take away from the strong feeling of deceit that lingers three days after finishing this book. I feel lured into a ""sentimental"" story only to be rewarded by a slap across the face. The ending ruined it for me. I'm still furious."
1,"cruel, sad little book to be avoided at all costs","As I was reading ""Timeleon Vita Come Home"", I felt myself becoming very sad and depressed, but was hopeful that the story would be redeeming in some way and decided to keep with it mainly because the author seems to be a talented writer. Nothing could prepare me for how cruel this book ended up being, and like other reviewers, I promptly threw the book across the room, and then sat down to cry. I would recommend this book to absolutely no one and I highly doubt I'd ever pick up another book by this author."
1,Sad & Disapointed,"Whilst on the whole I enjoyed the book, I agree with many of the comments of a previous reviewer: that the book was made up of 2 very different halves. I wanted Timoleon Vieta to be more involved with the lives of the people he came across, rather than just being glanced at occassionally.Any enjoyment I had of the book though was completely destroyed by the unnecessary ending. Being an animal lover I could not really read the last few pages & was angry that the author felt he had to end the book in this way. Even to the point of throwing it straight into the bin - something I have never done with any book before.I'm afraid because of this I will not be reading anymore of this authors books."
1,Don't Bother,"I got half way through this book within a fairly quickly, hoping that if I could get through it fast enough it wouldn't have the chance to bore me. Well, I didn't get to read it for a few days, and now I can't bring myself to go back to reading it. At least the other reviewers have told me the ending so I will never wonder.This is a stupid book about a man who has no life, and a foreigner who uses him....oh, yeah, and there's a dog.That's the first half, anyway. Once the book started talking about a whole new set of characters, I completely lost interest.Don't waste your time or money."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book for a friend, based on the cover blurb. She was really upset by the abusive cruelty both to humans and the dog and I was upset that I had given her the book."
3,nothing of popular science,"The book doesn't seem to be intended for a lay readership as it purports to be. Instead,it's fairly technical in terminology and statistics. For a better understanding of it,get yourself prepared in the basic knowledge of linguistic structure and psycholinguistics."
1,burned out after 10 uses,The mixer jammed and worked no longer after less than a year--and only 10 uses! Also agree that it was too powerful (when it worked!). The lowest speed spewed ingredients everywhere. It was impossible to incorporate flour into dough without a whirlwind. I do not recommend anyone buying this mixer!!!!
5,"Powerful, efficient","This Sunbeam hand-held is so powerful it amazes me. I have an antique Sunbeam mixer, and this new one is about twice as efficient and so small and nice to use, easy to clean. Timely delivery. Thank you."
1,stopped working after only a year,"I read this mixer was powerful, and I did not listen. It is. To powerful. There is no low speed to start a batter with, just high and higher. Now after a year, it has quit working. I think the problem lies in the button that is both speed and eject. It wiggles and seems cheaply made. Try another brand."
3,Can't close it.,"These long extension are great if you don't need to have the sliding material guides close completely under the machine. Since I move my saw around quite a bit, I need the extensions to close completely under the saw, which these extensions do not...otherwise, they're fine."
1,A Monumental Bore,"Thank goodness I am a fast reader. The three hours spent reading this supposedly enlightening self-help book are three hours of my life I'd like to have back. I found CW Metcalf to be shallow, without substance and wholly unfulfilling. I had really expected to take away some useful ideas for stress reduction and self realization, but instead found myself wondering how much longer this author could go on, and on, and on with the same thing. Other than a few gems of wisdom borrowed from some pediatric cancer patients (any one of which could have written a better book on the topic), there was precious little one could take away as food for thought. Reading a few days worth of Dilbert comics would be more useful for ""humor therapy""."
3,Open up your mind,"It's a shame the only other reviewer as of early 2006 is quick to attack the book on religious grounds. Most societies have religion to thank for their lack of humor. Open up, live a little and prepare yourselves for the shock when u die and find that u didn't have the truth after all."
4,Advocates Appropriate Use of Humor,"Humor is an instrument of healing if used properly, not a destructive weapon to be used to put down other people. Such is the philosophy of Metcalf, who along with his wife Roma Felible offer a set of skills built around that claim. The book has strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the argument that humor is a healing tonic has validity. They offer evidence of recent scientific studies that support this principle which goes back at least as far as the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament. Some of the skills they offer are doable and can be applied by virtually anyone. The disappointment comes at the end of the book. The chapter about death is NOT from a Christian perspective, but from that of a Buddhdist Since Buddha's still in his grave no hope is offered, just a shallow ""be positive"" which is an awful substitue for the promise offered by Jesus who is NOT in His grave."
1,DONT BOTHER,"Tripod is so cheaply made that i intend of returning it or trying to sell it off on Ebay. It seems like its all made of cheap plastic. i used it this past weekend and it did ok but the knobs don't tighten all the way so the camera tends too go forward or back wards. its hard to use the rollers with is thing. Its better to get a tripod and the cam control seperatley. The prozoom lanc control is a good one to attach to a monopod or tripod. Another good one is the varizoom. Both controls u ca attach to monopods, tripods and shoulder braces. I was really dissapointed with this tripod it just aint good quality. the company does have aother quality items, this one lacks it though. It should be redesigned with better material not plastic... The only plus is that it works with both the canon and sony cam that have a lanc control input..."
5,works well,"I've owned one of these for a couple of years now. We live in a hard water area, so it's important to squeegee the shower after each use or the mineral build up is bad. The blade on this is very sturdy and continues to work very well. I'm ordering some for the other bathrooms since we have company coming and I'm hoping they will use them."
3,Works well but blades breakdown,"The squeegee is light, attractive and easy to use. The hanger also works well. However if you use it on tile the blade will start tearing off after about 6 months. The replacement blades are on $2 on the Cleret website but the shipping is $8 which makes it almost the same price as buying a new squeegee, huh."
2,Not Happy,The rubber on the squeegee is too hard for the glass. Doesn't squeegee the water well. I wouldn't buy this product
5,"Timeless, practical and very, very funny","I found a copy of this book at an estate sale ten years ago. At first I thought it would just be fun to have on my book shelf, but when I opened it up, the wisdom poured out of it.Written for single women moving to New York in the 30s, the author does not hesitate to instruct, cajole and browbeat her reader. You MUST own four bed jackets. You MUST NOT have too much antique furniture.And the overriding theme of the book: when you are single, you MUST look out for yourself, because no one else will, and you might as well look out for yourself really well.Several of my friends read this book after I did. Based on its advice, one friend threw away all her worn out lingerie and started fresh. Another completely redecorated her house. Another started a financial savings plan. I began preparing much nicer meals for myself.I don't think any of us has bought a bed jacket. But maybe you will, after reading this delightfully illustrated and charming book."
4,Another great band outta New Hampshire!,"Well, I haven't heard the whole album, but I absolutely LOVE ""Crystal Eyes"" and all their other songs I've heard on the radio! Definitely need to buy the CD. . . ."
3,average quality according to the price.,average quality according to the price.If I will have this item - I would be scared to sell it.Needs to improve quality .
4,A Blast For All Ages,"I bought this for my daughter for her 16th birthday and we had a blast. We varied in age from 7 to 37 and we all had fun. It plays quickly and isn't boring. Guesswords is pretty much based on Password with the Disney twist. One side of the cards is Disney words and the other is just words, some easy, some harder. We all had fun playing and laughed a lot. Great family and group game! The electronic timer is also very durable."
5,GOT IT EARLY :),"Thanks now i have two games, Its 10x less money then all the others, I will value it forever, Got it super early, and had great cards inside thank you SOOO much :)"
3,difficult,"my 6 year old son likes the cards a lot. But as he doesn't know the game, the gameboy game is very difficult. After 5 minutes he put it to the side and didnt like it.If you dont know the card game...dont buy it!!!Otherwise, I guess it is ok. I have to figure out, how to play it."
2,Better than a blank wall,"This is a good, quick-and-dirty reference to the works of Jackie Chan with some interesting facts and trivia, but there's very little information on his life and training before the movies, which was what I was hoping to get from a book titled ""The Life and Films of Jackie Chan."" The information is completely lifted from other publications (interviews, fan newsletters, etc.) and it appears that the author did no further interviewing or research for the book. It reads like a term-paper on Jackie Chan, rather than a textbook."
4,5 stars for the Irish historian,"I have only read the first five chapters of this book, as I'm interested primarily in Medieval Irish Military history, but I must say that the book is very well-researched and well-written. The complicted Celtic names bog it down for the non-Irish reader, such as myself (and thus for the ""lay"" researcher, I only gave the book 4 stars). I found this book to be full of great information, but it's very academically minded and, therefore, best for the serious enthusiast.The editors wrote in the preface that they sought to focus, not solely on combat, but on the social history of the military as well - a perspective which I found to be interesting and innovative. Check out the Table of Contents and you will see how comprehensive this book is."
2,Where are the editors??,"I really wanted to like this book because the premise is good, but it was frustrating to read. I spent the second half of this book actually yelling at it. Formatting is awful, sometimes I couldn't figure out who was speaking and then characters suddenly appeared and disappeared. The timeline is completely off -- it seems like the kids went to school in the summer instead of the spring. Where did Victor go in the scene when they went to look for Karina at Casey's house? Kara, Karl and KARLTON? Are you kidding me? And they apparently stopped using condoms after Phoenix rescued her, so who is next? Karmen? Karoline?"
3,It's a decent read,But nothing special. It wasn't memorable for me. Although I did enjoy the kids antics. The characters could have used a little more development and a little more personality? There was something missing...
2,Not so impressed,"As an avid reader of all types of romance novels, this novel fell short for me. There was a disconnect between the characters and the plot took to long to develop. I expected to feel more passion and just plain ole love seeping through the pores of the pages of this novel. Instead it was rather flat and long."
3,Kids Playin Matchmaker!,"You have to love triples that trying to play match maker, and want to hook their mom up lol. I enjoyed the small town feel to this book and how the had each others back. Phoenix love for his woman and her kids even after she did him wrong was amazing lol."
3,With This Kiss Rating 3.5,i love a good romance story with a happy ending and that is what I got reading With This Kiss.The story and the characters were believable. By first read by this author. I didn't realize this was the second book in the series. White Lightning is first book I will look for since it is available in e-book.
3,Solid romance with a mystery,"This ebook I received free from the author is a testament to how lack of communication can change a relationship in a heartbeat. The main characters, Phoenix and Karina, are both to blame for the trouble that ensues, but redeem themselves as the story progresses. This was a quick, entertaining read with a nice twist at the end."
1,Dr. Cohn needs to get his facts straight.,"I purchased this audiobook and admittedly have completed only the first chapter. However, Dr. Cohn's credibility was lost in just the first paragraph. He begins by saying that Jack Nicolaus won 20 majors, in fact he won 18. He then says that Sam Sneed won 85 tournaments in his career, in fact he won 82. The reader then goes on to explain that Byron Nelson won 11 straight tournaments, which is correct. The only problem is that he called him Brian Nelson, not Byron. I was so shocked by multiple errors in just the first paragraph that I actually started the audiobook from the beginning to confirm that I had heard the misstatements correctly. Sadly, I had.I am still making my way through the book, but I am VERY skeptical about the future contents when there are so many errors already noted in the opening. I would have expected that getting the facts correct would have been a higher priority."
1,Very Little Insight -- Mostly Anecdotes about Pro Golfers,"I got this book on Feb 9 2005. Finished reading it on Feb 11, 2005.While the book claims to provide insight into ""how to go low"", it really doesn't. If you're interested in a book that talks about Pro Golfers scoring low, with no insight into the mental process, then this book is for you.I was disappointed by this book. It was not thought provoking."
2,not worth the money,"I bought this particular DVD - (volume four) on the strength of one of the reviewers who said the ""Mrs Mowiggins"" sketch was included (I even ordered it expedited). No such sketch was included - only a bunch of other ones which were very dated and which hardly made me laugh. It really soured my trust in these reviews because I just blew $60 on a lousy DVD I most probably will never view again. Hope the next person doesn't make my mistake!"
2,Isolation Chills,"Having never been a proponent of the lo-fi movement in the mid-90s (for a song to be recorded badly as an aesthetic value is nothing short of hubris!), I'm now put in the awkward position of making a case for Guided by Voices to go back to their sloppy heyday. On Isolation Drills, they've never sounded better to such little avail. Since Bee Thousand in 1994, their (badly) recorded highpoint, GbV have acquired tons of studio technique. Of the five full length CDs they've released since then, I can recall a handful of songs. In comparison, and from a cursory look at the Bee Thousand back cover, I remember every track, including bad musicianship and pronounced tape hiss. Would the songs on Isolation Drills be saved by the lo-fi aesthetic? Probably not, though they could use a bit of roughing up. Perfect as they are: ""Unspirited"", about the road too frequently traveled, and ""The Brides Have Hit Glass"", about the glass ceiling also known as marriage."
4,"""Big, Sad, Rock Record""","This will probably stand the test of time as one of GBV's best albums. I'm one of those people who didn't quite ""hate"" Do The Collapse, but was rather turned off by the slick production and excessive balladry. This, however, is just what you'd expect from GBV in a professional studio: bigger, cleaner, and just as brilliant. There are suprisingly few guitar solos or studio embellishments, although there are some beautiful cello parts that suit the pervading air of melancholy quite well. Fortunately, this melancholy is counterbalanced by the fact that most of this material flat out ROCKS. Robert Pollard has called it GBV's ""Who's Next"" but it's just as easily their ""Wish You Were Here"" or even their ""LA Woman."" (ahem) Not that it's really psychedelic or bluesy at all, but equally somber and majestic."
4,PACKAGED LIKE CANDY!,Listen to this record in its entirety and just TRY not to wish you were in a rock n' roll band.JUST TRY!
2,toby & mitch forever doug never,doug gillard is to gbv what jimmy crespo was to aerosmith! isolation drills is almost as bad as do the collapse. as for doug gillard there is no there there. still i must say that i am looking forward to bob's collaboration with toby.
3,Easy money,"Oh dear. Long gone it seems were the days when this band used to delight the listener with the rawest gut wrenching bombast this side of the hemisphere. The group's been in a gradual decline since their 96' release ""Under the Bushes"" wherein a commercial FM radio sound a la Oasis reared it's ugly head. Call me a punk if you will, as I believe GBV are a classic example of band who sounded ten times better before they learned to play their instruments. The charming ineptitude that made ""Propeller"" and ""Vampire"" sound so exciting and unpredictable has now been replaced into mere second rate arena rock. Given that songsmith Robert Pollard is the only remaining member from the original lineup left in the group, one begins to suspect, what with the usage of the GBV name and overly polished sound, that these guys are basically in it for the money. Nice job lads Mick Jagger would be proud."
1,"I won't lie, this album stinks!","There's no other way to put it. And for the people who like this album: you're not true GBV fans - you're fans of the Dave Matthews Band who were just waiting in the wings for GBV to get glossier for your tastes. I listened to this album once and never listened to it again. That's pretty bad for someone who has a broad - a very broad - taste in music. You name it, I probably listen to it. Unless of course it's Faith Hill or a less significant artist(s) like Blink 182. I don't know what else to say. This music is very amateurish and has no direction. What's Bob singing about? Who really cares?"
4,What's Wrong with Pop?,"As a GBV fan who prefers the radio-friendly output of the band to the more experimental stuff (which I guess makes me a non-purist), I have little bad to say about Isolation Drills. I look forward to flipping through some stupid radio station I usually pass on my way to KCMU only to be stopped in my tracks by the fabulous sounds of something like Chasing Heather Crazy or Unspirited.Rock and Pop are, after all, supposed to be for the masses, and pity the masses who have had little exposure to the most gifted songwriter of our time."
1,"Fun, but False","Enjoy this book, and the plays, movies, etc. But please, please, please, don't think for a minute that it is ""almost true."" Anna Leonowens was a liar who dropped out of school at the age of 14 to be the mistress of a British clergyman. She got the job in Siam by falsifying her credentials. The real story of His Majesty Rama IV, and his son, Rama V, is much more interesting than any of these thin romances."
2,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the book. It wasn't the best book I've read, but not the worst either. I didn't like the way the characters just had names. Nothing about anyone was in depth. It was like oh there she is and that was all. I would ony recomend it to a younger audience."
4,Solid Book,I bought this for a supplemental resource on my dissertation. It was useful and I would recommend it to anyone interested in diaspora studies.
3,Light-weight yoga,I bought the book as a refresher. It isn't for anyone who is learning and serious about yoga.
4,Comprehensive intro - some photos/postures could be improve,This is a very nice book save a couple photos/postures that were not accurate (at least to my eye): trikanasana (pg 138) and a.m.s. (pg 144) for instance. Aside from that it is an excellent book with some very insightful tips and explanations.
1,Beware the miniature edition,"The print in this book is so small, that it is barely readable. I would suggest getting the paperback version which is full size if you are interested in this title."
5,Wonderful collection of strange little stories!,"I have to admit I had not heard much about Etgar Keret until I saw the Wristcutters film. That inspired to read up on him and I ended up purchasing this book. I would be lying if I said I didn't find several of these stories very peculiar, but I would also be lying if I said I wasn't hooked from the very first short story! The novel makes for a beautiful collection of well-written gems, some of which are absolutely wonderful! I will certainly read it again and needless to say I am very happy with my purchase."
3,A Strange Little Book,"The Bus Driver Who Wanted to Be God is mostly a book of short stories, with one longer story to round out the collection. The writing really reminds me of the Beat writing of the fifties. Some of the stories really hit home and raised serious questions. Others seemed to be just fun. But which are which? Are all of them serious and I just don't get them? Or are all of them spoofs that I try to read something into? It is that kind of a book. If you like a good mental challenge, give it a try."
4,Funny perculiar and funny ha-ha,"Keret really is as unique and funny as people say in the reviews here. He came recommended by a friend and his super-short stories live in a universe all his own making.Absurd, yet not. You really have to read him."
5,His day will come,"Etghar Keret is a phenomenon in Europe and the Middle East. It's only a matter of time before American readers discover his talents. His stories are perfect capsules of beauty, humour and melancholy.In this world of over-publishing, a gem like Keret's must not be overlooked."
3,pretty good but no superbad,"I rented this movie because I thought it was going to be another Superbad. Same directors and some of the same cast, so why not? While it had some pretty funny moments, it wasn't nearly as funny and was way too predictable. Sophomore slump, I guess. Worth a rental definitely. If you like it, may be worth a purchase. I really expected more though. Maybe that's why I feel this was just three of five. Had it been from anybody else, I would have thought a lot more probably."
3,Dazed and Confused Light,This movie was kind of like 'Dazed and Confused' light. It was ok. Kristen Stewart is the stand out and Ryan Reynolds is like dog poop in that he is in everything and I believe I have seen him play this kind of part before. Still a nice little movie with some yucks. Some of the late 80's themes made me chuckle quite a bit.
4,There's a lot to be said for nastalgia!,"This was a really fun, heart warming movie with a little bit of tension, a little bit of comedy and a whole lot of honesty thrown in. I think you'd have to be the age the characters were in the movie during the mid to late 80's to fully appreciate the setting. It captured the era perfectly! (I swear I think I had the big, red, plastic heart earrings Lisa P wore!) The soundtrack was stellar. The acting for the most part was great. (I'm not a huge K Stewart fan!) Bill Hader, Martin Starr, Jesse Eisenberg and Margarita Levieva were all perfectly cast and had moments in the movie that made me cry I was reminising/laughing so hard. If you're looking for a great reminder of the age, a reminder of your life at that time or just a good movie in general, pick this one up! If you're looking for another Superbad... you might want to pass."
4,Mismarketed but very enjoyable,"The Bottom Line:An endearing coming of age drama/slight comedy with Jesse Eisenberg in top form as Jesse Eisenberg, Adventureland is not the Superbad-like comedy that the commercials promised but it's all the better for it; a sweet movie that develops characters into believable human beings and eschews pratfalls in favor of earnestness and plot developments that feel organic to the material, Adventureland is quite a little movie.3/4"
2,Watchable.....Only Once Though,Not the worst I've indured. Bill Hader was ok as was Ryan Reynolds. Kristen Stewart is easy to look at in this one. The movie is not as funny as it is billed. I did laugh though....once. Bill Hader was the best in a supporting role. He really had the best moments in this one. This one will probably end up a coaster on the table.
5,Great!,One of my fave movies of all time. The cast is topnotch definitely. Amazing how the director was able to gather these young actors right before they all became major superstars. Major kudos!
3,Fun movie,"I enjoyed this movie, but wondered why HD? not needed in HD & quality I could not detect any improvement over a standard movie?"
3,A comedy/drama about real life,"After graduating high school, james has to face the real world when his parents can't afford the college he wants to go to and has to take a summer job. so he applies at adventureland, a dead end job where he meets shady co-workers and this girl who he falls in love with but she has a secret. its a comeing of age story written well, its not laugh out loud funny as this is more of a serious movie with some comedy elements to it. decent movie to catch on tv, no crude humor like most teen comedies out there."
2,Disappointed,"First copy ordered did not play on our BlueRay. Sent it back and received a second copy. Same results. Will not play on our Blue Ray.Also, the jacket does not appear to be an original picture. Cannot tell if this is just a copied version or original."
3,No adventures,"Adventureland is a light movie, not too intense but it's till engaging. If for nothing else , one can watch it for Jesse Eissenberg's performance. He is amazing. Ryan Reynolds and Jon Hader have acted very well too. It is not a laugh out loud comedy but it's funny in some parts. It's not a feel good or touching romance but enjoyable none-the-less. It's not as raunchy as say Superbad but it has its moments. The plot is light. Yeah that's the word -- light. Too many references to drugs that were unnecessary in my opinion, they didn't add anything to the story. Parents were too cliched. Not a bad movie."
4,Surprisingly good drama comedy,"Although it doesn't really have much new things to say, it is quite interesting and thoroughly engaging. Its surprising in a way that I was actually expecting a Superbad type of film or one of those raunchy teen comedies, although there's a lot of sex talk and all those typical of a coming-of-age comedy, I thought the movie was effective in portraying the characters in a realistic way and the script was at least clever and interesting. I would have wanted the move to dig deeper into the relationship of the main characters, but probably not making it more complex is the movie's appeal. I think the emotional hook for me is the lead character's failed European trip; that alone brought back lots of great memories."
3,Moderately entertaining coming-of-age movie,"James, a slightly nerdy college grad lacking in sexual experience, spends a summer before grad school working at a seedy theme park in Pittsburgh where he falls in love and receives his ""education sentimental."" He falls in love with one girl, dates another, drinks a fair bit, does some drugs, is exposed to a variety of quirky characters and does some growing up.It's formulaic but redeemed by the sweet characters and occasionally by the half-witty script. Incidentally, we meet Kirsten Stewart who has gone on to become a tween idol in the ""Twilight"" movies. She's cute but not much of an actress. Most of her acting seems to consist of fiddling with her hair.Well, this movie provides a perfectly harmless and pleasant hour and a half of your time. To say more would be to waste words."
4,Funny Movie but bad commentary,"I found Adventureland to be a great movie with lots of laughs, 80s references, and good old pot smoking conversations. The blu-ray transfer is amazing in both picture and sound. The extras include some deleted scenes, short making-of documentary, and audio commentary.*Note about the AUDIO COMMENTARY: It says that it's commentary with director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg but might as well just be the director. The director CONSTANTLY talks and rarely allows Eisenberg to get a word in which pisses me off because there are a lot of scenes where I wanted the actors perspective or input and the director just keeps talking and talking about mostly nonsense. I know the commentary isn't the most important thing compared to everything else but if I was Jesse Eisenberg, I'd want to talk about my first major motion picture role instead of the director cutting me off and talking about BS half the time. Other than that, the extras are fine."
1,horrible,I lack the education needed to effectively tell you how bad this movie is. Save your time and energy and definately dont buy it.
1,Average,This is a movie about a boy with a high school crush. It is not a comedy! If you want to watch a great teen comedy watch John Tucker Must Die. This movie should not be listed as a comedy.
1,"I know 1987, and this movie has nothing to do with 1987.","Beside the fact that I was terribly bored with the story, it was unbelievably inaccurate. The clothing, the hair, the fact that none of these 18 year olds had trouble getting booze or getting into clubs - it made me wonder if any of the filmmakers were alive in 1987. I remember a lot more hairspray and hot rollers, and fake IDs.The only character that's sympathetic is the Russian lit major, and his one good chance at a conflict fizzles like a dud firecracker. The rest of the characters are boring and one dimensional. The so-called love story is clearly going to be a failure, regardless of how it turns out.Don't bother with this one."
1,A big snooze fest.,"Two words sum up this movie...""slow"" and ""boring"".And what's with Kristen Stewart's hair color changing about three times during this film? It starts out black, then turns brown and by movie's end is almost blond."
5,Nostalgic....,"If you were a teen in the 80's like I was you will probably enjoy this movie. It wasn't spot on to the period, I think it is more early 80's then '87 but it doesn't matter, There was a mood to that period of time that this movie catches nicely. Being the last decade of innocence ( I call it that because once the Internet and cell phones went mainstream in the 90's the world totally changed and so did being young) it really catches that lack of media exposure that allowed us to live our lives, to be a product of the area we grew up in and not just one of the stressed out fast paced media driven young adults that we see today. Those times will never return, ever and for us, it hits close to home. It was fun to be young then....."
2,Boring flick,"This movie seemed like it was a made for television flick filmed in the 80's. The plot just dragged along, the characters were fairly unapproachable in my opinion, and really, i just felt bored through most of it. The billing with the SNL cast and such was a bit misleading, since instead of being a comedy, it was a depressing drama. I literally walked away for a while to make dinner, came back, and found I really had not missed anything. There were a few good moments, but overall, i felt this movie was really just a waste of my time personally. Maybe if I felt some deep seeded depression about life and relationships I would feel different? Dont know, but I do know this movie wasnt for me."
3,Average Young-Adult Film,My expectations going into this film were average and that is this film was--average. The characters seemed somewhat immature for the college-ages they were supposed to be. I also found the parent/child relationships poorly developed.I have seen several films with Kristen Stewart and she does a good job portraying conflicted young women. I will be interested to see how she transitions to playing more mature female characters in the future.The one exception to the averageness of this film is Bill Hader's scene with the baseball bat--a classic!
4,Only place I could find this product,"I hunted all over town, but couldn't find this product anywhere. Amazon was the only place I could find these boots. These overshoes do a great job of keeping your favorite shoes dry and clean; they fit tight and don't slip around on your shoes."
3,Durable boots but...,These boots are heavy duty and well made. The only problem is they smell AWFUL!!!! Very overpowering odor similar to asphalt or roofing tar. They smell so bad that I won't leave them in the house. I store them in the garage.
2,not the best hitch,"loaded with cliches and unintenionally funny.... camerawork as usual is top notch...no real suspense.... this is the kitchensink hitch..... kleptomania,prostitution, suicidial tendencies, sexual dysfunction, the list is long not a bad two hours to while away but this is below grade hitch"
3,One of my favorite Hitchcock films!,"I do still think this movie is underrated. This is one of Connery's best early roles. I am a major Connery, Hitchcock (and James Bond genre) fan. The first time I saw the movie, I found it somewhat disturbing and cliched. But you find something new each time you see it. Connery brings a lot of depth to a somewhat implausible character at an early stage in his career (and looks gorgeous at the same time!)"
1,did not work on my dvd player,dvd did not work on my dvd player was copied to work in another country or something not sure what happened
4,"Underrated, but still...","This is another controversial Hitchcock film. I notice that Amazon itself gives it a negative review, and I think it does have a lot of crucial flaws. For one thing, the ridiculous painted backgrounds - one of a steam ship - are, while beautiful, more noticeable and out-of-place than ever. Also, the script is wordy and the plot moves slowly; clocking in at well over two hours, Marnie hardly has enough substance to excuse its length.Still, I feel that dual strong performances by Hendren and Connery (he should be remembered as much for this film as for any of his Bond roles) build a sort of momentum, eventually overcoming the latent torpor of the film. At first, the acting is a bit stilted, but as their life together begins to cement, they develop a striking chemistry which gives the latter half of the movie real emotional resonance."
4,The master's most underrated film!,"This psychological thriller about a determined businessman(Sean Connery) who falls in love with a beautiful, but strange woman(Tippi Hedren) who turns out to be a compulsive thief and liar , is one of Hitchcock's most underrated films. It has the romance, excitement, adventure and the mystery that have become synonymous with the master. Furthermore, MARNIE is the last of Hitchcock's truly great films. Bernard Herrmann's rousing score is perhaps his best in his nearly 10-year partnership with the master. Tippi Hedren hits all the right marks in the title role, making this her finest screen performance to date. I don't care what you've heard or from who you've heard it, if you're a fan of the master, do yourself a favor and see it!"
2,Not one of Hitchcocks BEST!,"This movie was absolutely boring. I tried to watch it, but I kept drifting away. It was not the type of movie you sit down and enjoy. It was mind-boggling, to say the least. IT has some elements of Hitchcock, but not really."
4,Nice Print,Some movies really aren't worth watching on DVD because the print is so bad that you might just as well watch it on VHS. This is a really nice print. They did a good job. It does have some flaws but overall it is quite good. The featurette is great. This is a good value for Hitchcock fans.
4,A Great Psychological Thriller,"The pairing of director Alfred Hitchcock and this film about a beautiful, psychologically scarred embezzler with dark repressed secrets, was ideal. This is a fascinating, film full of suspense, drama, and romance. Tippi Hedren, though she wasn't the first choice for the film, is very convincing, and well cast in the title role. She has great chemistry with Sean Connery, who gives a very charming and charismatic performance as her love interest.The DVD also includes some great extras.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
5,Movie,This was a gift. It arrived on time as indicated. The person who received the gift said it was great.
2,JCParis,"As for Torn curtain and Topaz, this remastering of the complex, astonishing and ""big sick film"" (F. Truffaut) ""Marnie"" in 1.85 (a bit too larger for a 35 mm base film in ""flat widescreen"" format - 1.66 should be most appropriate) is not to recommend for the bad colors balance, with flashy red (it is really too much even for the red-phobia-scenes!!!)."
3,Hitchcock Suspence????,"Got this to round out my Hitchcock collection of movies. It's quite good but not up to some of his older ones such as Notorious, Rebecca, The Lady Vanishes and his later ones such as Vertigo and Rear Window."
4,A Facinating Hitchcock film.,"Tippi Hedrin plays Marnie, a compulsive thief who cannot stand to be touched by any man. She also goes bonkers over the sight of the color red. Psychiatrist Mark Rutland played by Sean Connery is intrigued by Marnie so much that he marries her. Rutland is in his own way has problems his desire to marry a thief. After many plot twists and turns, Marnie is ""cured"" by a flashback sequence involving her ex-hooker mother."
1,Marnie,Completely implausible relationship between two main characters. No character development whatsoever. The surprise ending was predictable in the first 1/2 hour.
1,Unbelieveably bad,"I wanted to watch this movie after watching ""The Girl"" that chronicled Hitchcock's obsession with Tippi Hedren. In that movie it showed the movie Marnie that she was to make for him. I hope it was her last....the movie was ridiculous and the fact that I paid an extra dollar to rent it in HD is ludicrous. The sets in the movie looked like a painting in the background....nothing HD about it. Do not waste your money or your opinion of Tippi Hedren's acting or Hitchcock's directing abilities by watching this movie. I seldom comment on things but this one needs mentioning......I was appalled....."
2,Hitchcock's Swan Dive,"Save your money. Tippy Hedren should not have given up her day job; and Hitchcock, like Chaplin, should have ended his illustrious career with his best, such as North by Northwest."
5,Marnie,Hitchcock classic. Movies like this are just not made anymore unfortunately. The casting is EXCELLEN and the acting is excellent.
4,Good psychological drama,"MARNIE was a good Alfred Hitchcock as a ""mental movie"", featuring a wonderful cast and a heart-touching script. ""Marnie"", as they call her, is a wonderful actor and is also a good thief, but not as good as a liar. When she is caught in the act by Sean Connery, who plays Mark Rutland, her mental problems seem to have more of an effect on her, but they make this superb movie even better.So, I hope you enjoy this old hit, because it is one of the best."
4,Hedren is fine. What's the deal?,"Tippi Hedren is very good in Marnie, as is Sean Connery (but he's great in everything). Marnie is a little long/slow moving, but it is a fascinating ""head trip."""
2,Agree with original reaction,"Marnie was considered a flop when released in 1964, though apparently its regard has increased greatly over the years. I have now seen it for the first time.Perhaps my own evaluation will change over the years as well, but for now I'm back in 1964. The story is dull as dust, Hitchcock's fake backdrops and screens, usually beautiful and surrealistic as in Vertigo, Rear Window, etc, look phony and laughable. And Tippi Hedren--- while she may have been born to play the campy Melanie Daniels in The Birds, is just plain awful here. The sentimentality is very uncharacteristic of Hitchcock and not at all appealing, the character of the Mother is really dreadful. The impression overall is of a Vertigo wannabe - even the magnificent Bernard Hermann score sounds completely derivative from that Movie."
1,The picture quality is terrible,The picture quality is really terrible. Buying this DVD is just a waste of money.
5,Marnie,"Another wonderful movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Marnie is an entertaining show with a great cast. I wouldn't recommend it for young children because of the content, but I loved it."
5,"Stop The Colors. What Colors? My Aim Was To Commit Suicide, Not Feed The Damn Fish.","Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie is an engrossing thriller that sinks its hooks into you and never lets you go until the final image fades out. The question you'll be asking throughout is, Why? What makes this person do the things she/he does? To find out, you'll have to view MARNIE. Excellent acting from James Bond himself and Tippi Hedren, and an exceptional performance by Diane Baker coupled with a masterful theme by Bernard Herrmann make this film a classic. And of course, the answer is revealed...and it may not be the one you're expecting.Rated PG (a rape scene which is depicted tastefully, mild language and some violence)."
1,The lamest sweet valley book I've ever read,"ok, why is it lame? first, Jess and Liz are not getting together well throughout the book when the story is supposed to be about the 'Winter Carnival'. The winter carnival was only mentioned at the start and at the end of the book! To top it off, there is a mistake in the book-the part where Todd and Jeff have first met there when at Elizabeth's Secret Diary Vol. 2 it was mentioned the 'first' time they've met is at Winston's party-a welcome back party for Todd when Todd moved back to Sweet valley from Vermont. It just doesn't make any sense."
2,What the..?,"The title -Winter Carnival- sounded magical,and the story did start off OK as well as the fact that the very last scene -the winter ball- was enchanting.But!It just all goes down hill when Jessica dies."
4,Jack and the Leprechaun review,"This is a cute inexpensive St. Patrick's Day book. Jack helps his cousin Sean, but also looks for Liam the Leprechaun. M"
1,"Most topics are covered, but this book is barely readable","This book needs help, it is verbose. The book could be cut by a third, and would not lose any meaning. Most of the important topics are covered, but the discussions are often difficult to wade through, it takes forever to get to the main point.There are better introductory texts out there. The ones by C.P. Lo and A.K Yeung, or by P. Bolstad are both more concise, to the point, easier to read, and just as complete in their coverage of topics."
2,"Lame, at best","I totally agree with the two negative review above. This book is unnecessarily obtuse. You should look elsewhere if you are a total beginner. The information does not need to be presented in such a dry, academic manner."
4,Excellent documentary,"Documentarian Errol Morris points his lens at four men who are attempting to exert control over and wrest meaning from the raw stuff of nature through highly idiosyncratic means. They include a topiary gardener, a lion tamer, an expert on the naked mole rat (the only mammal that has the same social organization as insects), and a roboticist. They each discuss the intricacies of their individual callings; the parallels and recurring themes that emerge result in a rather touching meditation on man's drive to impose control on his environment.It is also worth noting that each of these men is clearly happy, at least when working. In this way, they show us how to be truly alive--find your passion, let it consume you, and don't worry whether the reviewer for Amazon.com thinks you are a weirdo./"
3,A Review Haiku by Todd Marrone,"Compelling premisethat never gets off the ground,you'll only watch once."
2,Barely watchable,"Mix 4 semi-interesting interviews with a great deal of banal filler, toss in some grating music, and voila, a few of the people who can sit through the whole thing will think you're a genius.The thing that irritated me the most about this film was how superficially each of the 4 subjects were treated. In particular, I would have liked to have seen more demonstrations from the MIT robotics lab, and less of the inordinate amount of footage taken from an insufferably cheesy black and white TV adventure series."
2,Wake me when it's over,"I literally started falling asleep during this movie. I had heard it was wonderful, but I must say it isn't nearly as good as everyone has made it out to be. Take a look at the four men who are the subject of the film. Sorry, folks, they ain't all that interesting. A guy who cuts bushes to look like animals. Yawn. A guy who studies mole rats. Whatever. A guy who trains lions. Zzzzzzzzzz. There is no grand statement about life to be found here. It is all rather mundane stuff masquerading as ""deep"" insight into the human condition. Needless to say, I think the breathless reviews claiming that this movie is ""brilliant"" and that ""it changed my life"" are preposterous.In short, this is a mildy diverting movie that I shall forget as soon as the final credits roll. Perhaps its greatest achievement is to show just how easy it is to fool people into believing a mediocre film is a work of genius. Leave this one on the store shelf."
5,Just Great,"A splendid, whimsical look at life, biology, innovation, evolution, technology. Defies catagorization. Creative, thoughtful and intelligent."
3,not as great as I would have hoped,"The mark of a great film is whether I will ever watch it again (and possibly again and again). This documentary has its insights, points of excitement and I'm glad I watched it. However, I can't understand all the fuss some reviewers have heaped on this film. Sure, it is far more worthy of your time than about 95% of the films coming out today, yet I don't think I will ever feel moved to watch it again."
3,"Overrated, but still interesting","Errol Morris' erratic documentary that fuses commentary with a lion tamer, a topiary gardener, a biologist specializing in mole rats, and a robot designer at M.I.T. The film is at times very interesting, Morris succeeds in fusing the four topics together and the film becomes something very different than one expects. But the black and white angled slow motion photography is poor form, and Phillip Glass's dramatic score tries to rivet you when the material is merely contemplative."
3,Good Scandal CD,"Just a note to previous reviewer,""pac-dan"", while this collection does fall one track short of entire EP, there is a new Scandal CD put out by VH-1 and it does feature all 5 tracks from original EP plus 4 unreleased tracks from that same EP. hope this is helpful to you. highly recommend this purchase to you as a fan of scandal."
4,A wonderful look back to another place and time.,"A young girl remembers the weeks around Christmas in Ireland in the mid-20th century. It is a book I'll keep with Christmas treasures to re-read and introduce others to another way of life, experiencing a simpler Christmas not lacking in magic."
2,Still reading it,"This book has not grabbed me yet. I have not found the stories appealing, with a very few exceptions. Anyway,I will finish reading it, mainly for discipline."
4,these short stories make for a pleasingly odd diversion..,"Haruki Murakami is known for writing some truly memorable surreal fiction. He has also written some more conventional work of high quality. In 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman' we have a little of both, and a bit of neither. Most of the stories are rather conventional, and quite well written. A few are decidedly odd, with surreal elements to them. And unfortunately a couple are total duds. But taken as a whole, this collection of short stories is a welcome addition to anyone's Haruki Murakami collection.Bottom line: these generally high caliber pieces of fiction are fine to read yet none are truly remarkable and unforgettable. Strongly recommended for Murakami fans, mildly recommended to all others."
2,Limp compared to other Murakami works,"This is the fifth Murakami book I've read, and very well may be my last, which is unfortunate considering how great The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Kafka on the Shore, and The Elephant Vanishes were. Compared to The Elephant Vanishes, the stories found within are even more dry than usual, and poorly thought out. Definitely surprising, and not a good sign. Avoid unless you're already a devotee."
2,Not as good as the rest,"I was excited to find a Stephanie Laurens book I had not previously read. However, I was very disappointed in this one. The stories (there are actually two) were slow and the plots uninteresting. This book lacked the senuality and fast pace of her other books. I'd love to hear more on the Cynster family - they are wildly interesting."
3,Toned down Laurens,"As a lover of all things by Laurens I was thrilled to find this book. I read the first story and haven't yet read the second. This is a very toned down version of Stephanie's style that most of us have come to expect. While very much an enjoyable read, it harkens back to the Regency love stories of 30 years ago where a kiss was the sensual high point of the story. I gave the first story 3 stars because it's by Laurens and lacks only the interesting and varied sexual encounters enjoyed by both hero and heroine."
2,Very Mediocre,"This book was a very ssllooww read. It was boring! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. However, the characters were good, but the plot wasn't there for either of the stories. I do give credit to the author for naming the book correctly. ""A Season for Scandal"" was exactly what it was. There was meant to be scandal, but in my opinion there was none. I have not totally lost my faith in Mrs. Laurens, and look forward to reading another of her books."
3,Earlier writing by Stephanie Laurens,"This title is one of Stephanie Laurens earlier publications and shows many of the aspects of plot development that she has used to greater extent in her later writing.Recommended for people who are interested in observing the ways writers develop their own style over time.Laurens is currently engaged in a series of novels concerning the Bastion Club, possibly with occasional digressions to the Cynsters. There are no particular cross references between these series to date."
2,SNOOZER!!,I was soooooooo disappointed by this book! I bought it purely for Ms. Laurens' name. I thought it would be a great read on vacation. I was so upset that it wasn't anywhere near the quality of the Bar Cynster books. Thank goodness I bought a Bar Cynster book with me and wound up rereading it on vacation just to entertain myself with a good book. Please Ms. Lauren stick to the Bar Cynster quality books that we have all come to love and romance over!
3,Not the Usual Interesting Stories by S. Laurens,"Although I read the reviews by other writers I must say I wasvastly disappointed in these two stories by Stephanie Laurens. I haveread all of her books and have loved them all except this one. Therewere pages and pages of the hero/heroine's thoughts which means no dialogue which really got unnerving after a time. Glad to see these were her earlier books as her later books are wonderful. I gave 3 stars because of her later books, not that I thought this book deserved 3 stars."
5,An enticing vibrating listen.,I like. Sounds like the Melvins being screamed alone in a dark isolated steelworks factory.
5,HP Pavilion DV6285US Notebook,"I got this notebook for the configuration, the processor, memory and XP OS. It is great. It far exceeds our expectations and I wish I could upgrade my other computers to this level."
5,Leaves Merchant Ivory Version in the Dust,"This is a riveting and brilliant production on all levels, for those who enjoy good drama, eloquent dialogue and the great acting skills found in British theater.By contrast, the recent Merchant Ivory film is revealed as banal, vulgar, and dumbed down. The BBC's Charlotte is a great heroine. Uma Thurman's is a boring, neurotic wretch. She makes you wonder what all the fuss is about."
5,Castanets,"Beautiful wood, great carrying case that keeps each in a separate compartment so they don't damage each other. Beautiful sound."
2,Dont buy. Nice seller thought,This print out is terrible. Not a good picture very upset when I received it but the seller was very understanding and gave me my money back for it after sending my out a second one to make up for the first. Thanks again.
1,"Same old, same old","The business of art is the business of selling objects d'art with little intrinsic value for huge prices to a rich, idle and foolish aristocracy. It has been this way for three centuries.Jackson Pollack, a semi-retarded alcoholic championed by a desolute upper class,brought this cynical game to its ridiculous peak in the mid twentieth century when we saw silly rich people gather in hushed awe to view and buy the most blatent trash and hang it on their walls with pride.Pollack thought them all idiots and was right.The post modern art world has retreated from this insanity but we still have artists such as Bo Bartlett practicing this silly game whose main purpose is to seperate the idle rich from some of their cash by means of hubris and pretense.This book is a propaganda piece in this corrupt enterprise."
1,Touching? Sounds like a show to me...,"Although this book gives some good insights into the Rabin family and the murder, I hate to say it, but it feels like it was written for the money. I understand that she is a granddaughter, but it is no excuse for the extreme melodramaticism and tangible hatred...I came out from reading the book with a very bad taste in my mouth! Sorry!"
2,Let tell you something...,"This is not what I think thatthe Spaniards would wanted done,in actual practice. This is allsacred music all performed onnative aztec instruments, nota single significant part forconvetional European instrument.In most poor congregation in colonialLatin-America, there would at leastbe an organ, or a gitar, in the poorestcongregations, if an organ was outof the question, a pair of recorderswould do just fine for church services.There are better versions out there ofcolonial Latin-American music."
1,The Empty Coal Bucket,"Not too bad for a self-published volume. Readers who grew up in Shamokin, Pa., may appreciate the descriptions of their familiar home-town surroundings. (Residents of small blue-collar towns, for some reason, are often tickled to see their town's name in print.) This little collection of stories succeeds in conveying a sense of the culture of this region, which provides endless fascination for the coal coterie, but may leave others out in the cold. The coal industry which once fueled American industry is dead and gone. As this book reminds us, there is not much left but culm banks and memories."
3,Too BIG!,"I bought this set to accompany my children's deluxe kitchen. However, it was way too big. Though it is definitely durable, it is not very realistic in regard to size and actual appearance. It has the shaker sound effects, but it is not like Mommy's spices."
3,Fun for a short period of time.,"I thought the toy looked great but my toddler was bored of it within a few days. Once he mastered the color caps in the correct order he was ""done"" playing with it. I really need to stick to toys that have multiple uses."
4,Excellent CD!,"Great musical variety on this CD. Jan's voice is awesome with unfaltering control and incredible range! Very talented display of musicianship, vocals, and song writing. I would recommend this CD for everyone's collection."
1,This bag sucks,"This is a beautiful bag in all ways but one. Unfortunately, the one way renders any positive features obsolete. THE MAGNETS SUCK! The magnets are so weak that the bag barely adheres to the tank. I have been riding with tank bags for twenty years and I've never experienced anything like this. A hundred bucks for a useless tank bag. What a sham."

3,Needed for a class,"I found the book to be okay. Some of it gets a little preachy and clearly one person's opinions. At times, the author turned me off."
