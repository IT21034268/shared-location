3,have i never been completely awake?,"This book is great. Literature? I don't really think so. It's not a blog either by any means, but it IS a story. I have been eyeing this book at museum gift shops for ages now, and I finally bought it, and it REALLY is difficult to put down after you get started. Things you've thought half conciously, or conciously, and then discarded in a moment, they put in print and make you seriously consider the question.Is hunger an emotion?Is there a secret tunnel that leads directly to the kitchen?"
5,Great hangers - solid without taking up too much space,These are great hangers. Solidly made - good thickness - don't take up a of space in the closet. I ordered a bunch of different styles of hangers from Amazon and these were my favorite.
4,Very Good Quality,The hangers are heavier than I expected and are of very high quality. I can hang heavier jackets and coats with ease. A bit overkill for hanging shirts and other lighter items.
3,A little heavy.,"These hangers were heavier than I expected. Overall they work quite well, I have been hanging pants on them and they have not deformed yet (unlike their plastic counterpart).Seems sturdy."
5,Funny,"I saw this stand up comedy many years ago, so I knew it was funny! Still is too! I received the DVD very quickly."
5,best stand up comedy show ever,I bought this for xmas gifts this year. My friends and I quote this stand up comedy act all the time. hilarious.
5,Delirious - Hurry up,"I have old (ex-rental) VHS, watched that much that its un watchable.... this has to come out on DVD, one of the the funniest performances ....ever!!! RAW was great! This is 10 times better"
1,What's Going On Folks,This is supposed to be the UNCUT 93 Minute Version of DELIRIOUSThis is the BUTCHERED 69 Minute HBO VersionWhy do these Video/DVD companies keep LYING to us
5,Add me as another...,"Please please please, why why why, we need need need the DVD!! Please, can't we please get into the CURRENT technology!?!?!?"
4,Oooooooooooohhhhhh YYYYYYYeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaahhh !!!!!,"it's delirious !and a bit tough to follow the man for a frog !...no f###in' subtitles !but with a good concentration, I can get most of the show.I will promote this DVD in french schools. it's very usefull."
5,Best stand-up ever!,"Eddie murphy at his best, and so young. You will laugh non-stop for hours after its over."
5,FINALLY,"The best stand up comedy video in history finally on DVD, the long wait is over let the laughter begin!!!!!!"
5,The Best Stand Up You'll Ever See - Bar None!,"This video is so funny you'll have to wear incontinance knickers to stop you messing the couch. Even my wife, who hates crude comics such as Roy Chubby Brown and Bernard Manning, etc., found this one so irresistable that she bought me Raw, the sequel to this video, for my next birthday. Trust Me, you will be not offended or dissappointed by this video. Even better than Richard Prior on the Sunset Strip! This video is the reason that James Brown said in the middle of one of his songs, ""Eddie Murphy, eat your heart out"". Outragously funny."
5,One of the funniest stand-ups I've ever seen.,This was sooo funny literally was on the floor laughing. It was great. It would be a great thing to show at a party with all your buddies.
5,Really funny!,"If you're ever down, get a copy of this video and put it on-guaranteed to make you laugh so hard, you'll forget all that was troubling you! It is crude-you'll have to overlook some pretty filthy language, but the laughter and imagery is plentiful and well worth the tolerance!"
5,Pure Gold,havent seen this yet? then you died sometime before 1988... why are you still walking around with us live folk? this video will split your heavily decaying sides with laughter.
5,Funniest Man Alive,"The first time I saw this movie I was six years old and obviously watching in hiding. I remember not really getting it but thinking it was funny. I never forgot Eddie in his red leather suit! Years later I somehow found it in the video store and rented it. It is the absolute funniest thing! You can quote it, and I do, I even, accidentaly, memorized it! I had to buy it and now everyone wants to borrow it. Everyone I've shown it to loves it. It's a definite must have!"
5,I laughed until I was sick at my stomach,"WOW - this is the original Eddie Murphy that brought him to the attention of the world. This has a ""raunchy"" rating of about a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10. You definitely do not want to watch this with your mother (or your gay friends or relatives). But I GUARANTEE that you will laugh until your sides hurt."
4,Beyond Norbitt and the Klumps,"Highly recommended for ADULTS. (Children and those easily offended should stick with SHREK.)Forget the fat suits, the big dresses and the 10 minute long fart joke scenes. Along with his Academy Award nominated DREAMGIRLS role and his luminous[possibly series saving] Saturday Night Live characters, DELIRIOUS will be the work that future generations of comedy connoisseurs will cite as evidence of Eddie Murphy's career-spanning genius.Unlike most of his movie catalog as an actor and character voice, DELIRIOUS is an uproarious and dizzyingly bravura performance in which Murphy distills his youthful Brooklyn vigor, channeling it via Bill Cosby's story-telling and filtering it through Redd Foxx's calculated vocabulary- creating an incandescent experience that could make you forget PLUTO NASH."
5,Eddie Murphy is a very funny fellow-RIGHT!,"In 1983,Saturday Night Live comedian Eddie Murphy decided to have one of his concerts videotaped and this one was highly popular amongst HBO viewers. The Engelwood,New Jersey native awesomely impersonates various entertainers including the late great Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Murphy mentions Motown great Stevie Wonder but does not impersonate him. Or did he? I know he did several times during his 1980-84 tenure on SNL. At the time of this recording,Murphy already was a film star appearing in popular favorites such as 48 HRS. and TRADING PLACES(both are Paramount property like this item). The popularity of this item led to another videotaped comedy concert,RAW. You can see segments of this item on youtube.com."
5,Goonie Goo-Goo,"It only took a decade or two for this to be released on DVD. I loved this way more than Raw(not to take anything from it)I've been dying to hear about the ice cream man, family outings gone bad, brown sharks and crap for furniture. I will buy this DVD the day it is released. At least it was released before I got too old to remember the best joke in the world-you know which one I mean(if not, it involves a bear and a rabbit). Enjoy-I know I will."
5,Good memories,This movie brought back good memories. This is a nice one for collectors of good comedy movies. Quick delivery. I can recommend it.
4,"FYI, not the entire show","This DVD is excellent, but it could have been great; be aware that the entire show is not on this DVD. One piece that's missing is the Mr. T, Honeymooners part. That was one of my all-time favorites . . . can't believe they left it out!!! Why????????Still worth the purchase though."
5,What Eddie forgot he was!!,"Topical, farcical,Eddie at his unashamed height. What a pity he became so successful. The ideal scenario of a fringe Eddie Murphy on the cutting edge of stand-up is wounding. Eddie alongside Bill Hicks with biting comments on society and all that ails it. No No a fat man looking for love, oh well!!"
2,Clint Eastwood my foot!,"I don't know why so many people found this funny. To me, it was an immature performance, lacking in all spheres.There aren't many laughs to be had here. I was truly disappointed at the lack of wit, depth and observational prowess. This is a childish narrative of different life situatons which is told in a most ordinary fashion. Raw was much better. Honestly, Eddie is not in the same league as Chris Rock and Richard Pryor."
2,Delirious,"I remember watching this on HBO when I was a teenager and was glad to find this on DVD. This is the Murphy comedy that put him on - tight red leather outfit, raucous, raunchy, and outrageous. The ice cream bit is still funny, but the backyard barbeque/Aunt Bunny bit wasn't funny then and still isn't funny."
4,Best stand-up ever,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the quality of the video itself is not great. Luckily, this is stand-up comedy and image quality is not too important.This is, hands down, the funniest stand-up comedy I have ever seen and it is Eddie Murphy in his raw, polotically incorrect, prime. If you are easily offended you might want to stay away but for everyone else it is a must-own."
5,Classic Eddie Murphy!!!,"This is a DVD that truly needs no review. I'd argue that anyone who ventured to search for Delirious then go a step further to read reviews already knows more than a little about Eddie Murphy and/or this DVD. Chances are you've overheard someone say ""Goonie Goo-Goo"" or maybe they did the 'ice cream dance' for you. Like most comedy fanatics I love Chappelle, Rock and Mac to name a few but those cats are no Eddie. As a matter of fact you'll find that much of their material is recycled Murphy-and of course Murphy is a Pryor clone but then again what GOOD black comedian isn't?! (But that's another subject.) Okay, so some of you are thinking, ""I already have the VHS. Why should I buy the DVD?"" I shouldn't have to tell you that the quality is much better but even more, the DVD has an interview of Murphy conducted by Byron Allen. The interview alone is worth the purchase. Every comedy lover should have this one. Enjoy and GOONIE GOO-GOO!"
5,It's about time!,"I can't believe this finally came out on DVD! I've waited forever. This is by far the most hysterical show ever...yeah, it is really vile. Sure, it is totally not PC.....but if you know that going in, and you take it with a grain of salt, you will wet yourself laughing. It really just doesn't get any better. Side-splitting, cheek-hurting fun. All my family members and myself have walked around quoting this movie for over 20 years....."
5,Just as described,This is by far the funniest stand up ever in my opinion. The shipping was fast and the DVD was brand new and still wrapped in it's plastic. Everything went great thank you!
4,Decent,"I bought Eddie Murphy Delirious DVD. It was decently priced considering I bought from Amazon themselves and not a random seller. The very beginning of the DVD had a couple of skips, which I was not happy about. The rest of the DVD was perfect, so I kept it."
5,UTTER BRILLIANCE,"I recommend this video to anyone who can get it, I have been trying for weeks to get a copy, I seen it years ago and only recently have I remembered about it and since have been trying to get a copy,for weeks now I have been copying the Mr T as a faggot routine and would just love to see it again, if you ever get the opportunity to see this masterpiece of comedy do so, you won't regret it!"
5,And den a big brown shark came...,"This is, by far, the most hilarious comedic concert ever... Not only are the jokes good, but Eddie's singing impersonations are dead on... Michael Jackson (80s MJ, not dancing on a van MJ), Elvis & Stevie Wonder are just a few he tackles. My VHS copy can finally find a home in the attic.. This DVD is a must have."
5,PLEASE PUT ON DVD!!,"Let's be real - how many of us have eaten at a restaurant and couldn't resist singing ""Lemonade..that cool refreshing drink..""; looked at the Kentucky Derby and haven't said ""We're gonna win this race!""; walked into Baskin-Robbins and shouted ""ICE CREAM!!""; or screamed ""MACDONALDS!!"" in their fast food parking lot! This comedy special needs to be put on DVD-ASAP!!"
5,Funniest stand up comedy EVER...and i got it on DVD,I don`t know if it is allowed to post a link here but i found a shop where u can buy it online. Send me a mail (Dogg_Pound@gmx.de) if u want to know where. No SPAM...no FAKE...just a hint from a big Delirious Fan
2,DON'T BUY the Same Book Twice!,"If you have lately come to be a reader of Stephanie Laurens, DON'T make the mistake of going back to buy this. It contains two of the three stories republished in 2000, in ""Rogues' Reform"". They were so forgettable the first time I read them, that I got twenty pages into this book before I sensed some awful deja vu...."
2,No idea why this was published when,"ROGUE'S REFORM (ASIN: 0373834586) was published containing the stories of all three Lester siblings. Ah well, if you have this and love Laurens, you might want to read it just to complete your reading of all the Laurens books and short stories around.Just don't expect the early Laurens and the Laurens of the Bar Cynster series to be the same, in terms of sensuality, alpha-heroes, tortured heroes, whatever."
1,You won't feel good about yourself for spending $90 for this,"This short, 15-minute video should be free...it's a sin to charge $90 for it. As a psychotherapist, I often use a cognitive approach to self-esteem issues, and thought that this video would be a useful tool in therapy. Although it touches on some basic self-esteem concepts, it falls short in many ways. Don't waste your money."
2,Ok Read,This was not Jack Higgins finest hour. I have read better. The ending was the only good thing about the book. Look for other Jack Higgins novels.
2,"Sadly, disappointing...","Sadly, I must report my disappointment in Jack Higgins' THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT. Many details that the author must have felt important were unnecessarily repeated throughout, where I would have liked to see more character and plot development. Instead, I felt as though I was following Sergeant Nick Miller around on his 8 hour overnight shift, searching for a guy who was recently released from prison. And when I say following for 8 hours, it felt like minute to minute. Others do like his style, but it just wasn't the style for me.J.R. Reardon, author of ADVICE AND CONSENT"
3,Exeter Wrestling Details Down Pat,"I found this book remaindered, popped it open, and was delighted to find details of wrestling at Exeter. I wrestled there in the early '60s, too. This gave me a chance to see ""Johnny"" (as I recall him) Irving's powers of recollection at play. His memory of the smell of the dirt in the cage floor (while the frozen winter soil outside would yield no smell until spring) when wrestling in ""the pit"" was a detail for me comparable to Proust's encounter with the smell of Madeleines in ""A la Recherche du Temps Perdu."" While I don't have patience for Irving's fiction, I'd like to see some stabs at journalism or nonfiction observation from him. The Piggy Sneed story is a wonderful gem."
3,"not Irving's best, but..","Although certainly not Irving's best work, PIGGY SNEED is definitely a great vacation book to bring with you. The stories are faily quick to go through, and if you stop in the middle of one of them, it is pretty easy to pcik it back up again. Some of the stories are rather interesting, while others are a throwback to his days as a wrestler/wrestling coach, which doesn't particularly interest me, but might interest another reader."
4,Irving fans will like it.,"I've read and loved all of Irving's books. This one was not the worst of John Irving's books, but I don't think it was the best either. I think that Irving's great talent is as a novelist; A Prayer for Owen Meany is my all-time favorite book. Still, this is a very enjoyable collection. I recommended it to a friend who'd never read Irving as a kind of jumping-off point and he liked it a lot."
4,"Interesting, too much wrestling for me, otherwise great.","I really like how he also defends Dickens and found his short stories great, makes me want to go back and read my first Irving book, ""Garp"" though I have a few I was not able to get to, so I will try Son of the Circus first."
2,Not my favorite,"Although I love almost everything John Irving has written, I didn't care much for this one. It's a compilation of short stories, his memoirs and his opinions of Charles Dickens. It seemed like just a mish-mash of things that should have been in separate books. Short stories in one book ok. Memoirs in another etc. I only gave it a two star since I truly love the way he writes."
2,Piggy Snead,"Irving's a great writer and I've read just about everything by him I could get my hands on. Turns out THIS ""book"" is a short story. Surprise! Again, I'm not too fond of being refered to as ""Bozo"" in lieu of creating a profile. That suggests exactly how you view me and your other customers."
4,"It's a memoir, not a short story collection","Several months after reading ""Trying to Save Piggy Sneed"", I found myself recommending it to someone, and in describing it I suddenly realized what it was -- it's not a short story collection, it's a memoir. It's Irving's way of writing an autobiography, and a very clever one at that.Autobiographies are inevitably a little skewed or even dishonest, because they're written after the fact, through the lens of the author's life at the time he/she was writing the autobiography and his/her urge to create a narrative. Irving has done something very different, by including stories he actually wrote at different times in his life, and using them to tell his life story. The little essays after each story not only illuminate the stories beautifully and tell Irving's life story, but you also get a fuller and more accurate sense of the development of the author through his life than you would had he simply written a conventional memoir. Very unique approach."
3,More about wrestling than writing.,"Selected recollections by Irving, written when he was recovering from an injury and kind of out of sorts. Wrestling and writing are the two focuses of his life, but since the latter is private, and this is not an investigation of the ""inner life"", the book is more about wrestling than anything else. Irving is a likeable guy, and this is a likeable book, although I would not recommend it for readers not interested in athletic competition. Packaged with the memoirs are some short stories which did little for me."
4,For John Irving Fans,"This is an interesting memoir and it is entertaining as well. Although he always insists that his fiction is purely fiction and not autobiographical- his life sure does shine through in most of his novels!He does tend to go on a bit too much about wrestling- great for wrestling fans but a tad tedious to the rest of us. But it was interesting to hear about the rest of his life and the influences of other people and authors in particular. I was surprised to learn of his connection with one of my other favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut.My opinion of John Irving is enhanced by his memoirs- he has a subtle sense of humor and is amazingly enough, still quite humble and and able to make fun of himself."
3,Not Irving as his best.,"John Irving was bedriden when he wrote this book, and it shows it. He wasnt feeling well enough for writing a novel, but he was kind of bored so he wrote this exercise of a memoir.When he talks about his life as a writer, about his childhood, about Piggy Sneed, about his children, its Irving as his best, but the wrestling part its so boring that you have to be masochist no to find yourself skipping pages.The shorts stories are a sure proof why Irving likes to write novels, he's not a short story teller, its well known that he believes that there its nothing worth saying in 30 pages that wouldnt be better said in 300. But I enjoyed his essays, specially his pasion for Dickens.Not Irving as his best, but worth a look"
5,Wonderful examples of John Irvings's writing,"There is no way to describe the writings of John Irving. From Setting Free the Bears to his latest novel , he continues to surprise and delight me. In Trying to Save Piggy Snead, he introduces himself to us in all his facets and brings some understanding to his generally off-the-wall style and content. I personally love his semi-colons; they are so necessary to the pace of the writing. Inercollegiate wrestling, his second passion, is described in a bit too much detail in his second story but it does give insight into his life forces. I loved the book."
1,music,I had purchased the Daughry cd and it was awesome. Definitely a plus to my music collection. I saw this cd and thought it would have music on it too but it really is all talk. I was very disappointed. Chris Daughtry is a very talented individual and I look forward to a release of a new cd that is all music!
3,Lard Free - self-titled (Spalax),"Originally released in 1973,as this was Lard Free's first out of three lp's. Liked this title as much as I did their 'III' CD(see my review). Well played French progressive. Don't let the 'French' part scare you off, this reissue really is worth checking out. Better cuts were the lengthy, nine-minute ""12 Out 13 Juillet"", ""Livarot Respiration"" and ""Culturez-Vous"". Line-up: Gilbert Artmen-drums&keyboards, Xavier Baulleret-guitar, Jean Jacques Miette-bass, Yves Lanes-synthesizer and Philippe Bolliet-sax."
1,Unacceptable!,"This scope a serious problem as received. The dot was not a dot. It was a series of little sparkles that looked more like a star burst and actually obscured the target.Thanks to Amazon, they gave me a full refund."
4,Wake Up to the Boo Radleys with this one!!!,"Wake Up! is by far the most pop-y of the Boo Radleys' albums, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable. You never get bored with this album, from the energetic 'Wake up Boo!' and 'It's Lulu' to the more low and serious but ever-so melodic '4AM Conversation' and 'Wilder' to the distinctly Radley-esque tunes of 'Joel' and 'Martin, Doom! It's Seven O'clock.' This is one rockin' album that'll keep you smiling and asking for more!"
3,Only Works in Liquid,"I do not yet know what to make of this thing. It reads neutral (7) in distilled water as it should and acid (4.5) when I add an ounce of vinigar to a gallon of tap water (as it should), but always reads close to 7 in just about any type of soil or composte -- no matter how moist they are. Even peat moss which is supposed to have a PH of less than five reads 7."
5,Horsez,My 9 year loves this game and plays it constantly. She gets very excited when she gets a new horse and is really looking forward to one of her friends to get the game so they can play together.
2,My daughter wanted to return,She has the nintendogs game and lovez. She asked if she could return horsez after the second day though. She is 14 and may be too old for this limited game.
4,"complicated, but worth it.","I just got this, and to be honest I like Horsez 2 better. This one is more complicated and takes more determination. I would NOT recommend this for a young kid. It would be great for those teenagers who loves horse but you dont want to buy them one. Get this game for them instead, this will keep them busy!"
2,"Daughter says ""Not fun""","I bought this for my 12 year old daughter, who loves horses immensely. She played it for about 30 minutes and asked me to sell it. She stated that it's nothing like the back describes, it's hard, and she doesn't understand what she's supposed to do all the time. Basically , hard and boring. This coming from a girl who, no matter what the ds game is, almost always plays a game from beginning to end. So, it will be going on eBay, which means someone will get a heck of a deal."
2,What I think about Horsez,"I am 11. Horsez at first was pretty cool, but after a while it is pretty much the same thing over and over again so it gets really boring. I would probably recommend this to younger kids. I personally did not think it was a very good game."
4,"Great game, will keep you busy.","Horsez is a wonderful game for anyone who loves horses. You need to train, and care for a stable horse. While your caring for the stable horse, you can compete and win competitions with it so you can earn money to buy horse equipment, get show clothes for yourself, or even buy your own foal! If you care for the foal corectly, it will grow up and you'll have yourself a great horse."
2,Good for the younger crowd,"For younger kids, this game is probably fun. It's linear, simplistic, and basic. I found the dressage controls annoying, as my DS did not seem to understand that an X is an X and an O is an O half the time. Moving the character around was irritating as well. She is slow, so it takes forever to walk back and forth between rooms, doing tasks for your friends."
4,Great Game!!! But what's up with the third week???,"This is a very fun game! You can take care of your house, ride it, compete with it and other stuff. Oh, and the person who asked the question about the 3rd week and how you can only get to go to the chat room once, if you take a 'stroll' you get more popular too! But what I don't get is that in the 3rd week I get a perfect in ALL of the things (Popularity, Dressage, Jump and Cross) My Horse is full heath and mortality (or whatever it's called) but my horse LEVEL (One of the things they test you in to tell if you can go to the competitions and next week.) stays at the half-way mark no matter what I do. Is that because I didn't beat Antonio or whatever his name is? I've tried multiple times to beat him, but I don't know how....But anyway this is a great game and I enjoy it. I would've gave this game 5 stars if it wasn't for the stupid 3rd week..."
3,Its good in little amounts.,"The game runs in weeks. And each week you have to do a certian amount of things, like jumping, or talking to people to become more popular. If you don't do all these things, which can be hard, then you fail nad you have to redo the week. So everything you did is erased.The game seems to drag on and you seem to be in one spot for a long time. It seems that you are always on a goose chace. If you are trying to get somthing done, like get a book for someone, then you have to get a sandwich for someone else. And in order to get the sandwich, you have to help someone. Its enyong.But the game if fun...ish. I think its ok."
3,okay game,"I think this game is okay. It is sort of fun, but can get a little boring. At first, the game was confusing and hard to control. But, I got the hang of it. Overall, this is an okay game. You should buy it if you like to take care of horses."
1,Very disappointing purchase,"This DVD is in some bizarre format that will not play on any of our players, not even on the computer. It was a Christmas gift and I am extremely unhappy."
1,complaint,"when purchased goods I was charged postage and packing ""when goods were delivered you had charged an extra 12.67 this I was not made aware of""I am not satisfied with this extra charge I have emailed you many times to resolve this over charge but you have chosen to ignore me,I will not be purchasing any more goods from Amazon please close my account now"" its a bit late for excuses""""""""I feel I have been conned."
1,US VIDEOS DO NOT WORK IN THE UK,The Video would not work in the UK and am amazed none of us knew that. ITS Been RETURNED !
4,What about these dvds?,"Love the series. It arrived in a timely fashion. We were excited to watch this favorite series....however these discs don't load in and play in our main dvd player (Like the thousands of other dvds we own). Thankfully they work okay in our other player. Was this priced less because of lesser quality? This seller seems to get hyper and bent out of shape with less than 5 star reviews, yet they don't seem to be as up front as others about refund or exchange."
5,a new decade.....!,"are you into shoegaze-dream-space-rock ? then you'll like this !!i did't thought that after ""you brought us here"" they would takeme into a new level of atmospheric guitar-emotions.....so i was wrong. with 6 tracks 26 minutes you could say it is like a EP or a mini-album but it doesn't really matter, what counts is how long the ""strange feelings"" stays after it's finished. i won't do track by track review, just let the music speak for itself !go their website for some listening.i think the artwork for a album is also important and this one says it all.... ENJOY !!!"
2,"An okay book for a toy accordion, but...","This book is fine for teaching an elementary child to play the toy accordion, BUT if you get the First Act Play Accordion, the exact same book comes with it. The only difference is this is spiral-bound instead of a stapled booklet, and this one is in color. So, save your money and just use the one that comes with the accordion!"
5,Excellent book,"Anyone in a profession of treating, evaluating, or diagnosing dementia's should read this book. It is detailed, thorough, and well written. The CD that comes with this book makes a great purchase for teaching or presentations!"
4,For Fans Only.,"This game is fun for CSI fans. It gives you a handful of cases, which are really not that complicated, and allows you to be a part of the show's universe. Not bad for $25. Anyone looking for a real challenge or a long involved game will be disappointed."
3,ended too soon,"Loved the game! Fun and interesting, however I was disappointed that there were only 6 cases to solve. I think there should be at least 36 cases."
1,What's up?,"I too ordered this product a while ago and keep getting the run-around from Amazon. At the time I ordered I wasn't aware that the game wasn't even released yet. Since I've discovered the ""lack of it's existence"" I've emailed Amazon several times explaining to them that they should change their listing to read ""Pre-order"" instead of ""Usually ships in 4 to 6 weeks"". They keep emailing me back saying that my order is ""on-time"" with the stated shipping. It's like they refuse to understand what I'm telling them. Oh well, I'll just wait for the game. I'm certainly not going to get it any faster from anywhere else because it's NOT OUT YET!"
4,Interesting Game but Fun,"Game was not what I expected, but fun to play. The transaction was great and came in a timely manner."
4,Fun - Just like the show!,"If you like the show, you will love the game. Easy to follow and fun to play."
1,Boring,"It is just horrible.Boring and stupid, not what I expected at all. The graphics suck and it is a big waste of time. Thank god I didnt spend 40 dollars on it."
3,Can I have it!,I pre-ordered in Nov and it was supposed to be received in Feb the shipping date has been pushed back at least 5 times. I'm getting irritated but I don't want the PC version.
2,Not Very Encouraging,"Although this book contains a lot of interesting information, Mary Ellen Bates makes it clear that if you don't have a degree in library science or an extensive background in research you are pretty much wasting your time. I can appreciate her experience but she doesn't give much encouragement to those of us who don't have her background and/or connections. This is not a book for those looking to build a business from the ground up."
3,eh these are cute,these are cute not as big as i thought they were..kinda difficult to put in and i think way to expensive for this product these shouldnt cost more then $20..cute just way too pricey n im not cheap by any means
1,A Useless Book,"Save your money and leave this book on the shelf. This guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. Moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, Peterson's ""Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers""."
4,Roofing (Quick Guide) was a Big Help,"The book was easy to understand and had very helpful illustrations. It did not cover some recent roofing materials, such as 'dimensional' shingles and 'ice guard' eave protection, but using this guide alone, you have all the information you need to roof your first house (it worked for me). P.S. Don't roof it by yourself; you will save a lot of time with a good helper."
2,Not worth the shingle it is written on,This is not the book I would recommend if you want once that really shows you how to roof a house or business. Buy something else.
1,Not a new book!,I bought a new book but received an used book with notes on it. And there's no aplia access code.
3,Does anyone know if this comes with Aplia?,Does anyone know if this comes with Aplia? i need it for the class and i'm not sure if it is included with this book
2,Highlights,"I read the descriptions, and it says that this book has some highlight. To my surprised, a whole page of highlight is not what I considered some or minimal. Quite dissapointed with the amount of highlight in this book."
1,Not terrible but doesn't cover everything on Aplia homework,"As a basic intro to Finance this book is fairly good. The problem is the Aplia homework requires you to figure out things that the book doesn't teach you how to do... so you need to spend a ton of time and frustration trying to google what it is looking for.The Aplia subscription is also very expensive and mandatory if your professor decides to use it... $125 just to be able to submit my homework for the semester. (And that does not include book price, it is just for access to the Aplia site.) It is designed to force your grade lower than it should have been on the first attempt to give the appearance of students progressing to the professor. Occasionally all answer choices to a question will be wrong as well... so you basically have to guess what answer it wants."
3,Cotten Stone to the rescue!,"I liked the ""Grail Conspiracy"" and I will read more Cotten Stone mysteries. As with many other novels, you just plain have to suspend your disbelief for a while and enjoy reading outlandish, fantastical things. This story does have a lot of Christian subject matter, but I don't feel like it's preachy. The authors did surprise me in that this was more than just a search for the Grail. (I know that's vague but I don't want to spoil it!)"
1,so bad it is almost funny,"I am so glad I bought this from the ""daily deal""....but it wasn't even worth the 99 cents I spent. The writing is very remedial, the conversations are forced and unbelievable, and the plot is just plain bad. I wasn't expecting the DaVinci Code, but I was expecting something enjoyable and that could keep my attention. I now know to stay away from any other Cotten Stone mysteries. Such a waste of time."
2,Nancy Drew meets the Rapture Nutters,"I would categorize this as adequate juvenile literature, much like a Nancy Drew or Judy Bolton story. Plot: predictable and a bit silly; characters: predictable and shallow; written in a 6th grade vocabulary. The story is a goofy amalgamation of conspiracy elements all surrounding the myth of the holy grail; plot elements are fairly easy to guess. Quite the opposite of a page-turner, this story is perfect for keeping in the bathroom and reading whenever you're in there. Overall a quick read and quite forgettable."
1,This is a dissapointing Catholic driven,"Grail Conspiracy: A Cotten Stone MysteryBook. The history is poorly researched, the authors have no knowledge of Templar history or tradition. It seems that Catholic pulpit based rantings are the basis for any of the Knights Templar history put forth in this book. It should probably be read by people who are interested in the Templars simply so they are familiar with some of the myths that are perputated about them. But don't waste your money on it, check it out from the library."
3,For Arcane Bible Mystery Aficionados,It is a well written book and builds up the suspense.As usual the Authors go into little known biblical stories and build up on them to create earth shaking scenarios.The heroine is particularly fiesty with a tendency towards throwing herself into the arms of unsuitable charming men.The plot was going along nicely when the Authors to bring it to a hasty conclusion (their biggest weakness) turned the Book of Revelations on its head and created an unbelievable biblical situation.I nearly gave up then and closed the book.Someone should tell the Authors not to take the Bible too seriously unless they have a captive readership and dont give a damn (oops I blasphemed).
3,Would be better as a movie,"I wanted to like this book. The Grail and the search for the Grail are just fascinating to me. I think I would have enjoyed it as a screenplay, but frankly, parts of the book moved slowly for me. I loved ""Phoenix Apostles"" a later work by the authors and loved it. This book had some of the same elements and perhaps I would have liked this one better if I had read it first.I had trouble with the cosiderable use of explitives and using the Lord's name in vain by CottonI am not Catholic, but objected to the near romance between Cotton and the priest John.I also struggled with the fact that Cotton blatantly stated that she didn't believe in God but she is the ""choosen."" Just didn't sit right with me.This book WOULD make a good introduction to anyone not familiar with the Grail or the traditions around it. Nice sprinkling of fact among the fiction."
3,Enjoyable,"This book is an enjoyable read. It resembles the Da Vinci Code only superficially -- it does deal with the Holy Grail, but in a completely different manner that Dan Brown's book did.This book takes the Bible much more seriously, and in some ways resembles the plot of some of the ""Left Behind"" books with its focus on the Book of Revelation and the anti-Christ. I found the plot to be highly original, but not quite believable.The book is written in a simple, straightfoward style that is easy to read. The authors don't waste a lot of time on description, and get right down to moving the plot forward. If you like books with a fast moving storyline, this book should meet your needs.This book is apparently the first book in a trilogy, with the same central character in all 3 books. I look forward to the next book."
1,"Very shallow, very bad!!!!","Weak and simple plot, unbelievable and boring characters, and poor writing make this book difficult to finish. The book pretends to be a religious/historical/thriller novel similar to books from Dan Brown or James Rollins. But the plot and 'conspiracy' in this book are lame and predictable, and very amateurish."
5,Loved it,"I could not put it down. Yes, the plot was predictable at times, but it was a nice, fast paced, captivating read."
2,Amateurish,"I was really looking forward to getting this series of books based on reviews I have read here. I finally got a couple of the books and have been very disappointed. The plot is simple, the characters are either vapid or just a name, and the reading level is about 3rd grade. If you want a quick read with not much thought - despite people's claims of how well ""researched"" these books are - then these are the books for you. If you want a truly well-researched story with strong characters and a plot driven book then go back to Dan Brown."
2,Disappointing,"This book was difficult to get into. It just didn't spark my interest. In fact, I put it down several times before I finally pushed forward, & finished it. It was one of those books that's premise sounds so good but fails to deliver. I kept thinking it would get better. Finally, about 2/3 of the way through the book, it did get a little better, and more interesting. I thought this has the promise of a great finale! But, sadly, I was let down. My final thoughts upon finishing the book, and putting it down were: 1. That was it?! 2. What a boring ending. 3. There were so many ways the ending could have been done better instead of just leaving you flat."
3,Solid entry in an overpopulated genre,"This truly is an interesting piece of fiction. The character development and plot keep the reader's interest throughout, and the ending brings it all together quite effectively. The only reason for the middle of the road score is that this is but another book capitalizing on the recent market trend Dan Brown seems to have blown wide open with the DaVinci Code. Don't get me wrong, its not that this book isn't original, its just that one can't turn around without being smothered in religious related conspiracy theory these days. And if you so happen to be a person who reads them all and somehow still lusts for more along such lines, Grail Conspiracy wont disappoint."
3,Well written,"This book was well constructed and well written. However, I found the plot to be too much of a stretch for my 60 year old sense of reality, and rather predictable. I would recommend it more for a younger person, but it did provide some hours of escape reading. It is a well done work in this genre, but not the Da Vinci Code."
4,SWEETNESS,This CD rocks all you people out there who like blues. THIS IS FOR YOU.His songs also relate to young and old listeners.
2,WTF?,"I rented this because the box looked creepy (there's just something about dolls, man) and because Junji Ito's name was on it. Imagine my surprise when this turned out to be a weird little mammajamma of a stalker/slasher/superhero(yes, superhero)/possession(?) movie. Actually the creepiest part, for me, was where the psycho stalker imitated how the heroine brushes her teeth.This gets one star for originality and another for its sheer gonzo approach (apparently the director has seen Evil Dead 2 and, if he hasn't, that's a mighty fine coincidence)."
1,I want some of what Junji was having...,"I don't even know where to begin, there are so many reasons to why this movie is that bad. Editing is choppy, doesn't make much sense, and alot of scenes are drawn out. This would be a great movie to watch with friends if you plan to make it a mystery science theater night. The entire movie you'll either be laughing or in great confusion. There was one highlight from the film that I found enjoyable (Which was also just thrown in for who knows what)... They showed a giglo walking around a mall and decides to leave because one of his older customers wont take no for an answer... Suddenly he's in this dark alley when unsuspectingly here comes a sledgehammer! The killer breaks all his joints with the hammer, puts him on strings and makes him into a puppet... I couldn't stop laughing, everything else was downhill.. This isn't a spoiler because there's not much going on in the rest of the movie... Don't buy this!! Rent it with a funny friend at most.."

1,Not A Saving,"1. The ink quality does not match Epson's ink.2. It does not avoid nozzle check process.If anyone who needs to print out in qty, I do suggestbuy a bulk ink system such asinkrepublic, Lyson, etc. It cut down 90% of the ink cost."
5,From A Student's Point of View,"I am a college student studying political science at the University of Hawaii. I spend a lot of my time researching global conflicts. WWII was epic. I bought this book to improve my knowledge of the matter and it paid off. During class I can bring up short little anecdotes that are scattered through out the book that really happened, stories that my professor didn't even know of. This book was a fun read and I have been leanding it out to all of my peers in my world affairs class. The best part of the book is that it provides the reader with a deep understanding of what it must of been like for the GIs over seas.THawaii"
5,Outstanding book-A must read for anyone interested In WWII History,"This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII history. In my opinion, it should be a family keepsake for everyone who has a family member that served with the 45th Infantry Division. My father, a proud Thunderbird, wept when he read this long overdue book. He remarked how grateful he felt that someone was able to tell the story he could never talk about. I Read the book to better understand my father and I have gained new insight as to what these great men endured during this horrific war. Get the book. You'll be so glad you did!"
2,"Hippocrene-type, bad transcription","It is a typical in the series, basic vocabulary both ways, basic grammar, and simple phrasebook. But the transcription is rather bad. Russian letter in Mongolian don't have Russian values. It's not ""en"" but ""in"" (e is very close). It's not dalai, is sound more like dahhleh (ai is open e). So called u is a close o, u with umlaut much like oo (that's what it says, but why is ue given in transcription). Z is dz but that is not marked either. Guess this language needs good phonetical description. I have Rutledge's tapes, but they are too fast."
3,Somewhat advanced for basic introduction.,"I was looking for a simple basic guidebook to Mongolian everyday language. However, found this book slightly too advanced for that purpose. Vocabulary is written with cyrillic alphabet, so mastering that would be a must to get full benefit from this book.The general introduction into language is well written and interesting. And relatively low price is a plus."
3,Don't Do It -- Half Dollar a Piece!,Thought I was ordering a bundle of these. Instead it's just 20 drops. My fault for not reading more clearly. I didn't realize anyone could charge $8 with shipping for 20 cough drops -- that's almost a half dollar a piece!
3,Nice looking but the cab came off,Had to go out to the shop and find a screw to put the cab on with. It only has one mounting hole. My grandsons are 4 and 5 and they have a ball playing with it. Just didn't expect to have to repair it before they even had a chance to play with it.
1,Junk,"I purchased this truck for my grandson for Christmas and it was broken within two days. The truck is described as Die-Cast, but that is only the tractor. The trailer is plastic."
1,"failed to keep charge, used once, won't re- charge",won't bother with after market stuff again. should have stuck with sony brand.can't understand. it should have re charged and held it. but won't.
4,Kodak Slide Projector Lens,Delivery in 5 days. Item works well with my 4200 Kodak slide projector. Gets the job done.
3,History on Disco sound,This is documentry on Disco music. It is interesting stories but i would have expected more or longer music clips. Nevertheless if you into the history type of stuff this is the right one for you.
5,Well done history of disco and party people,"I use to be a go go boy,then disco disc jockey,back in the 70's,the last big party movement the planet had,and it was fun being brought back to that very magical time...Disco was a very exciting,fun time,and it had a soundtrack all it's own...The video was produced very tastefully,and is chock full of information and interviews with alot of the very cool people that made it all happen...I loved it!"
3,Disco - Spinning the Story,"If you are a Disco maniac I suggest you to have it. But it is just a documentary. There's no video clip, expect ""I will survive "" and ""Never can say goodbye"", by Gloria Gaynor. If you want something else about Disco, I suggest two movies: Studio 54 and Thank god it's friday."
2,Sick and Tired is more like it!,This was an awful movie. It looked as if they filmed it on a cell phone. The story was terrible the characters laughable and the Special FX....what Special FX? You would do well to skip this one and watch a blank screen instead.
2,Ball joint for TJ 2002,"If you own a 2002 TJ jeep beware, it has a sliding stud for correct fit, you need to make sure it is set to the correct length before installing. I did this and it backed out. You need to make sure it is set correctly otherwise the bolt for the hub will not be able to fit since the bolt is too low. I am not a mechanic but purchased another brand which installed correctly with out adjustments"
1,Failed w/i a day!,"This ball joint was installed into a 2000 Grand Cherokee. It backed itself out of the opening in the inner-C after 1 day of driving on it. The tolerances are off on the ball joint housing and it does not create a sufficient ""mechanical weld"" to hold it into place.I primarily have always used Moog products, do to their quality, but this item has let me down. I ended up having to buy an inferior quality product as a replacement. The replacement fit perfectly and confirmed that it was the Moog ball joint that was bad, not the inner-C.Buyer beware. I may have been unlucky this one time with a Moog product, but this one job has now cost me 2x as much as it should have."
2,Meh,"While the concept of the book was intriguing, the execution left me wanting. I was happy to see how independent the main characters are and that they were so obviously flawed, but I mostly found the situations of the book unbelievable. The actions and dialogue are forced. While I have a certain weakness for historical romances, I will not be continuing with this series."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I expected more info on how to put your portfolio or presentation boards together. This book is full of pictures and seemed more of a display item. If you are looking to find out more on how to create presentation boards or portfolio's, this isn't the book you should look for."
2,pattens,"was not much of any help with the designs my daughter was trying to design. Perhaps for someone who is a great at sewing would enjoy this book, not someone just starting off."
2,I was expecting something better,The Fashion Design ideas here are for a very extravagant type of people.
1,wrong book cover!,"Dear Editor,Just an FYI: the jpg book cover you have here is different book from the one you are promoting by Janet Boyes. Please look closely and you'll see : )Elaine"
4,night light material,"my little girl really likes this lamp. it's not very bright, so i wouldn't use it to read by or anything, but it works perfect as a night light."
3,It's an Olympus LC43,"The product description doesn't say the size of this lens cap.It's the Olympus LC43, a 43mm Lens Cap.Unfortunately, it's the WRONG size for my old C-3000. :-(Three stars because it is a lens cap."
3,Disapointing,"Being quite the fan, I was real excited to hear about a new album coming out. But when I listened to this shortly after my birthday, I was really disapointed when I heard it. Many of the songs are boring and seem to sound the same. ""Lover Please"" is the only song on the album that is even okay. i wish she had done better."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I have liked many of Melissa Etheridge's CDs, but I'm getting tired of hearing the same thing being rehashed. Her themes simply haven't changed over the years and the lyrics on this album are not very good. While some of the music is nice to listen to, many of the songs sound too similar to ones from the previous CDs.I would look to Yes, I Am, Never Enough, and Brave & Crazy for the best Melissa Etheridge. Since those albums, she hasn't put out a whole lot worth listening to."
5,Beautiful.,"No album/CD has ever touched me the way this one has. Thank you, ME. Love from Atlanta. J."
5,Skin,"After a writing and recording layoff, Melissa is BACK!! Awesome CD that makes the listener feel like they went through the tough times with her. You can feel the pain in her voice and music. This is by far the best from her in awhile. Glad she is back recording and performing!! Highly recommended to all listeners."
4,ETHERIDGE SHOWS SOME SKIN AND PAYS OFF,"Melissa Etheridge is back with her umpteenth album ""Skin"". I would have to say it is one of her best projects to date.Etheridges voice is in fine smokey form, as she goes from one cut to the next. A well slick produced album with wonderful songs like ""Lover Please"", ""The Different"", and ""Heal Me"".Etheridge shows with time she just keeps on improving with a wonderful sound and quality all her own.One of my favorite cuts ""Heal Me"" has background singer pals Meg Ryan and Laura Dern lending a hand.Etheridge shows her pain and growth in this album growing up from ""Come To My Window"", showing a darker, deeper side.I welcome it with open arms."
4,Welcome Return,"Skin is an album that you have to praise. The quality of each and every track is so high. My personal favourites are The Prison, Goodnight, Please Forgive Me, Down To One and Heal Me. Although i have listed five tracks i could of so easily listed the whole album as i love it all. This album is perfect for anybody who loved her previous album as its along the same sort of lines that it seems that it is an extention rather than a new album.(definetley worth buying)"
2,Disappointed,"I am not sure just what I expected from this cd, but it wasnt what I got. I normally love Melissa, but this one made me feel I missed something. I suppose I expected more of Melissa's rockin' style, like the songs ""Lover Please"" and ""the Different"". But instead its kind of a string of sappy songs that all meld together.I still love Melissa, just not this one."
5,loved it,How can you not love everything that Melissa Etheridge puts out musically? Her voice is a national treasure! She puts so much emotion into her songs that you sometimes feel like you have a window into a small part of her life. My husband and I love everything she sings. Everyone should buy this album!
5,Melissa's best work,"An awesome CD. Elegant, poignant, powerful. Superbly moving. Lyrically enthralling. Captivating. Compelling. It so beautifully captures the pain of a breakup and the move toward healing. This applies though, not just to a relationship problem, but any healing journey. The pain is real as is the commitment to her own survival.However, this album does not fall into the easy trap of bitterness, pointless anger, self-hatred or blaming others. It searches through the wreckage and slogs through pain to get to the other side. And there is another side. Melissa finds herself and reclaims her right to passion and love in ""I Want To Be In Love"". ""Heal Me"" is an incredible anthem, a statement of hope and promise.I'm a therapist, and I have used songs from this album with my clients, especially those going through marital changes or healing from sexual abuse. Thank you, Melissa, for a remarkable work of true honesty, transparency, and insight. You inspire me."
5,Awesome,This is a great cd. Melissa always sings from her heart and emotions. I own everyone of her cd's and will be purchasing this one soon.
1,HORRIBLE TOY GUITAR - MADE ME CRY,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS A REAL GUITAR UNTIL I PLAYED THIS, I WAS SO UPSET, I PLAY VIDEO GAMES, I DON'T THINK I WAN TO LEARN GUITAR NOW BECAUSE OF THIS BAD BAD EXPERIENCE"
2,More of an exquisite card than a book,"If you're looking for an actual book, something along the lines of a chapter of Emily Post, this is NOT that. It's a lovely little card of a book; something sweet to tuck in a gift basket with a bottle of wine. If you're really going to make a toast for a special occassion and have never or rarely had the honor, I wouldn't suggest placing all my research here. If you have made a few toasts in your lifetime and weren't raised by wolves, most likely the content has already occurred to you."
2,Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine,"I bought this because it looked like a comprehensive resource for a H.O. that could be stuffed in my pocket, but I found myself in a bind with this book. I think it might be useful in England, but if you are not ready to work with British units and medication names it is pretty tough to use in an American hospital. I found myself scrambling for other resources when I tried to use this book. I wish I would have bought something else."
4,Intriquing look at Waters' life and career,"Shock Value is like Waters' autobiography, mainly focused on his film career. There are only two chapters about his childhood. The book will be very interesting to every Waters fan as it provides in depth looks at the making of several of his earlier films. The book's material is dated, however, since it was written before he completed ""Polyester"". Waters' updates you in the new introduction though. It is very clean and has few curse words, unlike Waters' films, but is still good. I recommend it."
3,Good sound for the price but flimsy construction,"For the price this Grado has a reputation for excellent sound and I think it's well deserved. As someone who listens to a lot of jazz and some classic rock, pop and classical, I found the sound to be balanced and non-fatiguing.Where I was disappointed was in the construction: The threads on one of the screws that connects the ear piece quickly wore and I was left with taping it together. Not all reviewers have had such an experience so perhaps it's a case of a defect and poor quality control."
4,Grado Prestige Series SR-60i,"I first bought the Sennheiser h280 Pro headset at a local music store but returned them because the closed style muffled the highs to me. Bass was adequate, overall sound was ok. The closed pads were soft and comfortable but really kept heat in around the ears and created sweat with extended use. The store clerk looked at me like I was crazy as he owned a pair and thought they were great.I opted for the Grado SR-60i from Amazon. I probably should have spent the extra money and bought the 80i but these headphones suit my purpose. I like the sound clarity and the light weight on my head and ears. I find the foam pads to be comfortable. I probably sacrificed a little on the bass (compared to the 280) but as I like the highs to almost ""crackle"", the SR-60 was the right choice for me."
4,American sound.,"I have read many good things about Grado Quality and most importantly the S.Q. that Grado is well known for. A person can just see that these headphones were not just an after thought just to make money on the side, as many companies do. The first audition was a surprising experience. I love music and love to hear all the little details that the instruments make. Grado is a brand that will do just that with ease. When played on cheep mp3 players the Grado headphones seems to compensate for the mp3's low quality and presents the music with detail and robustness. When my daughter first used these Grado prestige series SR-60i, the first thing she said,-with a smile- was these have bass. I would recommend these to anyone that loves music. Grado has many upgrade models as well that should please you. Remember this is an American company so lets do our part to help our own economy."
4,"Good, but not perfect.","I read all the reviews here and made the decision to buy these headphones based on them. They're definitely the most comfortable headphones I've owned, but the sound isn't as great as I expected. Sure, they sound good, but my AKG K-26P's sound better for my tastes and they were only $40 (although totally uncomfortable). If you want a less-colored sound, these Grados may be right for you, but if you're looking for impacting sound with more drama and punch, I would go with the AKG's instead."
5,Completely satisfied after several months of use,"I use these headphones daily at my workplace and I love them! The sound quality is amazing. The bass is full and deep, and the treble and vocals are clear. Blasting the volume results in extremely little distortion and music sounds great at all levels.My only complaint is that there is a tad bit of sound leakage, but that comes with any open-ear headphone. It hasn't drawn any complaints from my coworkers."
3,"overrated. but for the price, not too bad.","quite some bass, but not tight at all, aiming nowhere. cheap materials. uncomfortable earpads.good thing is the price and the fact that it is almost never discounted. but if you can watch for some good deals, you can get HD555 or Bose AE (first generation) at similar price with much better sound quality and comfort."
2,Mine broke already :o(,"I've had mine for almost a year now and have been really happy with the sound. Unfortunately, they broke today. The plastic pivot pin used to connect the phones with the body snapped in half.I only use these at my desk so they haven't seen any hard use at all."
2,Should have gone with sennheiser earphones,"I am not a professional sound technician. I can't rate the bass, mids and high frequency sounds of these earphones. I use them to listen to audio books and music and they work fine. But a couple of things I don't like and make me wish I'd bought the senheisers instead. First the shape of the cans - not a smooth profile. A chunky hard stacked profile. Second, the ear cups are not padded, they have a foam cushion that comes off very easily and gets lost. Within a week I had to source another pair. And lastly they don't come with a carrying case. I didn't think much of this - figured I would find one on Amazon and order separately, but for some reason Grado doesn't make a travelling case and finding one the right size is no easy feat. Some reviewers even said they ended up getting a case from th UK Amazon site."
5,A blessing and a curse.,"They're a blessing because they bring out hitherto undiscovered facets of my music. Truly, the sound these cans produce is glorious, with that scintillating quality that I haven't heard since the last time I went to the symphony. It fills my head, not just my ears--that's the best way I can describe it. They're a curse because they have revealed a crackle that iTunes for Windows produces during CD playback. The old headphones did not reveal that unpleasantness, and now I'm back to using WMP, which I had previously regarded as inferior. Not that I'm complaining or anything. These headphones frickin' rock."
4,"Great, but they're not expensive for a reason","You already know from the many reviews that the sounds on these cans are phenomenal. My only beef is the quality of the make. After just over a month, the right ear piece just fell off from the metal peg attaching it to the headband. Squeezing it back in worked as a temporary solution, but after doing it so many times the hole is stripped, and there's no keeping it in. It stays fine if I'm wearing them, but putting them on or picking them up can be a hassle. I don't think many other people's SR60's have done this... just thought I'd point it out."
3,iphone jack,Sound quality was excellent for the price. The jack was too loose connected to my iphone 4 to maintain contact. I had to tape it down using electrical tape when I wanted to use the phones. I had no problem with any other headphones or ear buds. A real PAIN !
5,What else can be said about these wonderful headphones?,"These headphones are the epitome of value. They are comfortable, they sound great, and they are built to last. These babies stand up against any $300+ headphone out there, and in most cases provide a more natural sound stage then even the top brands. Every good thing that you will read about these headphones is entirely true. I cannot say enough good things about my Grado's."
1,Waste of money,"Waste of money, do not buy these. I bought them and they fell apart within a year. I wasn't even hard on them, just wore them like a normal person, hung them on a rack when I wasn't using them. One day I went to put them on and the cheap plastic that holds the rails to adjust for head size split in half. I taped it back together with duct tape, and a week later the other side broke. The cables are also wired in a bad way so regular use causes a lot of wear and tear on them. By the end of their life ( a year ) there was no sound coming out of the right ear due to the cable being broken at the Y joint.Do yourself a favor, skip these. For a lot less you can get equal quality with a much better lifespan."
4,"Great sound quality, some annoying parts","The sound as previous reviewers mentioned is stellar. I'm getting to hear my music collection all over again in much richer detail. Also, they are extremely comfortable. The pads are soft and the band bent well to suit my larger-than-average head.However I needed to get an extension cable to get them to work with my system. Also since there's no in-line volume I'm going to have to get a new keyboard with volume controls.(edit) Another note here is that the ear pads will wear away on contact with your ears. After a bit over a year of use they had worn completely through. The official statement about this is that the oil from your skin will wear them down and you should clean them once a month. However I do not think cleaning my headphones is a chore I want to have."
3,Nice sound - average comfort,"These sound very good and I like the construction. However they don't cover the ear, just come up next to it with foam. The foam is not super-comfortable. If they covered the ear, cut down more outside noise and were more comfortable they would get a 10 from me. The sound quality for the $$ IS a 10, however."
5,Believe,"I researched the heck out of headphones. Finally a friend gave me the advice of the Grado SR60i's. He essentially guaranteed I would like them. The Grado sound stage is not for everyone. However, they are just perfect for what I was looking for. Although they are ""weak"" on bass, I find them wonderful as I do not listen to much bass heavy music. The highs and mids are crisp. I've had them now for a while, and they do get better the more you break them in. For a headphone under $100 bucks, they are great."
3,Surprisingly disappointed,"My only frame of reference is my pair of Sennheiser HD428's, and the Grados really did pale in comparison to them in comfort and looks, and the prices aren't very far apart. I can't wear these for over 2 hours or they really start to hurt my ears, and I fear that if I stretch it much further It'll be too loose to use."
4,Great Grado,"The only reason I would not rate them 5 stars for the money is the cord is so thick it is hard to use them when I am doing the portable bit. I enjoy a early morning walk and like the way they keep my ears warm and give a wonderful warm sound to the music. Works great with the MP3 player, plenty of volume not like the other ones I was using when I had to use an amplifier."
5,The best at this price,"If you don't have a problem with annoying other people in the office this is for you. It has open air design so anybody can hear what u r listening to. However, the sound is clear over the whole range. Fantastic."
4,GREAT VALUE,"Forgetting my Sennheiser PX100 were on, I got up and walked off. This terminated its' wiring. After that experience, I looked for longer and stronger wiring. The Grado SR60i met these requirements without being awkward. They are heavier than PX100 but quite comfortable and with less pressure against the ears (head size 7 1/2). I like the sound better than PX100."
4,Good sound for the price.,"I don't do a lot of ""serious"" listening with headphones as I prefer loudspeakers in a larger room. I bought these for listening to ipod, itunes and audio/video tracks on my computer (without disturbing others.) I'm very happy with the sound quality. I don't find this design as comfortable for hour upon hour of listening as my closed cup Boise phones, but it's quite alright in the shorter run and the sound is cleaner. Grado builds these to meet a price point, and the value is in the drivers. Of course the rest of the design is plastic, and doesn't look like it would hold up for a road warrior. Mine will just stay at home, and probably last a long time."
2,actual musicians prefer--,"If you are looking for a great set of reasonably-priced cans, special order a set of AKG K240 Monitor headphones. It's an old, discontinued model, but AKG will still send you a set. I'm a professional drummer and have been using this particular set of headphones for well over eight years, and they sound great with jazz, classical and even live rock recordings (Allman Brothers Filmore Concerts, Little Feat Live, etc...). They are durable, astonishingly accurate, and very comfortable for long-term listening. My iPod drives them perfectly up to reasonable listening levels. Anything louder will blow out your ears anyway. The AKG K240 Monitor model is STILL one of the most preferred cans for professional studio production, if not THE preferred cans."
5,Great Product,"Got the headphones yesterday and am wearing them right now as I write this review. These have great, clear, crisp sound. By design they do not block out much of the background noise, but I actually bought these because of this fact so that I am able to wear them while I work, hear great sound, and still hear my phone ring. Great quality sound for not a lot of money!"
4,Excellant and Best - Except,"The best quality sound in mid and treble ranges. Bass some what weak. Clear, detail and non distorted tones emerge into the balanced inner stage of the headphone. No other headphone under a hundred dollars comes close to the sound purity.Biggest flaw is the cord wires easily break creating shorts and loss of one or both sides. I am on my 3rd pair due to wire breakage. Repairs by profesionals have not been successful. If you can afford it buy the extension cord to lower the risk of wire breakage."
5,Nice quality and a good price,"I'm not an expert, and I only have three headphones: the one that came with my ipod, Sennheiser PX 100 and this one.I'm really satisfied with the sound quality at this price range. I tried Bose Triport and QC 2 and another model by Kose, but I feel the sound quality of this one exceeds all of them. I also feel that it's clearer than Sennheiser PX 100, which seems to be a bit ""warmer"" or hazzier than SR 60.However, this pair is obviously not for outdoor or library use, which is really a problem for me. The cord tangles and is too long and thick, and the sound leaks. I had to get used to pads since they really made my ears itch in the beginning. However, I like how you can adjust the headband.Anyway, great sound quality at a nice price range, just don't expect you can use it outside while jogging or in a library. Simply good enough for me."
2,Others could hear my music!,"These sounded nice. No doubt about that. But there was so much leakage of sound, it just didn't work for me and my needs (open office environment). When I used them on medium iPhone volume, I could clearly still hear my co-workers talking around me, and they could hear my music. No bueno. If you are planning to use headphones basically anywhere outside your home, I'd pass on these."
2,Beware; very bad customer service,"As a long-time consumer of grado cartridges, I requested these headphones as a gift last year, mostly due to my track record with their turntable cartridges (happy enough, as 'long-time consumer' would suggest). Three-four months after using these (only in home setting, no travel, no pets, no kids to interfere with preservation of these) sound completely ceased to come out of one side. I contacted the company and was informed (rather rudely at that) that no warranty coverage is provided for purchases made through Amazon, which does not serve as an 'authorized retailer'.Not only will I strongly discourage music colleagues from purchasing grado products, I will find another company to buy future turntable cartridges. I am very disappointed with this product, and I am not a particularly picky consumer.2 stars as opposed to 1 only because, while they were working (however brief), they sounded ok."
4,Great product,I'm no headphone expert but we use it with a Yamaha electronic piano. The sound is so clear & of such high quality that at first I frequently took off the headphones to ensure I wasn't playing through the piano's speakers. Now I recognize that the sound through the headset is much superior to the piano speakers.
4,Amazing sound; Everyone can hear what you are listening to,Positives:+Amazing Sound. The best I've ever heard coming from cheaper headphone.+Thick Cable that won't twist up and is plenty long+Cool Retro Steam Punk look+Solid constructionNegatives:-Sound bleeds everywhere; not too bad if you have your own cube but won't work on a crowded bus-Uncomfortable for laying down or at an angle; best for sitting up as the headphones are a bit lose to fitI use these in a work environment sitting up. After people stopped making fun of my listening habits they have turned out amazing with only a few small drawbacks that are well worth overlooking for the sound. I would suggest Grado look into the comfort and bleeding aspects as both are definite downsides.
5,WOW! The best pair of cans I have owned,"Ok folks, you have probably heard that before but in all honesty I can say thatand it is true, these are the best pair of cans I have ever owned after owningSennheiser, Bang & Olufsen, Sony, etc.The Grado SR-60i headphones are light weight and very comfortable on myhead and ears, and after using various headphones for over 20 years in my job (retired USCG Radioman) I wish I had, had these while standing watch.The sound reproduction is fantastic, high frequencies are where they should beBass frequencies are probably the only weak spot, but I had to hunt forsomething negative to say about these.Yes there are cheaper headphones out there, that sound well cheap.There are also more expensive headphones that sound no where nearas good as these do.Very happy with my purchase."
3,Great Headphones,"These are the best headphones I've ever had. They are comfortable and produce great quality sound. I've listened to the SR-60's and the SR-80's and in all honesty I can't tell the difference. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend these to a friend.**Update**So the sound quality is still awesome. But after having these headphones for about 6 months the left headphone fell off. You can reattach it but it falls off again about once every two hours if you wear it regularly.The sound on that ear also cuts in and out, I have to hold my head a certain way to hear it.When I first got these I heard they were awesome but was a little skeptical because they look cheaply made. It turns out mine was."
4,"Great Sound, Would Like More Bass Though","These headphones are amazing-I heard sounds that I didn't know were there in songs that I've listened to hundreds of times. My only complaint is that I wish the bass was a little deeper and more prevalent. I'm sure that the SR60's are reproducing the sound accurately, I just like a little more bass in my music."
4,Great Sound - short on comfort,"I gave these to my son as a present. He let me listen to them briefly. The sound is really good, but the comfort is lacking. Maybe its my head with thining hair, but it was hard for me to get comfortable during my short time listening.( Yes,I use other headphones without problems. ) My son,who is nineteen with a head full of hair, seems to like them just find. They will run from an MP3 player without an external amp at a resonable volume. This is a very good sounding headphone, maybe others have come up with a fix to make them comfortable."
4,Great at-home headphones,"Sound: Great range and pretty flat signature, but not the most precision nor the biggest soundstage.Looks: Laying non your desk or hanging around your neck, these look phenomenally retro. On your head, they can be pretty bulbous (I would have preferred the flatter design of the old SR-60s).Comfort: Not as comfortable as around-ear phones nor smaller on-ears, and the hard vinyl band will irritate a thinly-haired head, but nothing major to complain about. They are somewhat adjustable by bending the headband.Durability: I cant imagine these will ever break or wear out. Grado is also well-known for their repair service, so you're coveredNot exactly designed to be portable, it has a huge cable (in all dimensions) and similarly large jack that doesn't want to work with ipod cases (it can be driven by portable players, though). It works great for sedentary use, though, and is comfortable enough to be worn for hours on end."
2,piece of crap,"This headphone is overrated, , sound quality is okay but bass is weak, low is too exaggerated and not loud enoughBuild is horrible, padding around the ear is like 1980's technology, everyone can hear what you are listening and you can hear environment noise very clearly. and it looks bad like very bad. Leather parts are cheapest leather you can ever imagine.this is just waste of money, pay $30 $40 more and buy Technics RP-DH1200 or Pioneer SE-DJ5000 , Pioneer HDJ-1000 or like any Senheiser around $100 and learn what is THE HEADPHONE!!!!"
2,fatiguing sound,"My ears are hurting just after a few minutes of listening and I don't listen loud. I've tried different sound cards and headphone amps. It does not matter, sound is very fatiguing. Not only Grados, all headphones with large flimsy diaphragms have fatiguing sound."
3,sounds great..but looks akward,"Compared to other well known brands like Sony and Sennheiser, these cans1) sounds great2) but looks akward .I used HD202 before which has closed earcups, so they dont touch at the center of the ear(they partially touch at the periphery of the ear). But SR60 cramps you all over the ear..and you feel like getting them off after every 5 minutes.I prefered SR60 after reading the review at headphone.com where they call them best sounding headphones under $100..agreed. they sound great.But for me aesthetics is quite important too..SR60 scores 0/10 in that aspect with cheap plastic all over and cord as thick as 1/3"" Dia (so ugly looking). Coupled with unease of use(cramp ur ears), I dont recommend them."
3,"Great Sound, But...","The headphones do have good sound for the price. But, they are TERRIBLY uncomfortable. I have to put styrofoam padding above my ear to hold them slightly off my ears, because they make my cartilage go numb. I should have returned them, but I didn't feel like hassling with it. Also, my family gets annoyed when I wear them because even without the styrofoam padding I added, they leak sound like crazy. Half the reason I bought them was so I could listen to my music without bothering anyone, but I have to go into another room anyway, or turn the volume down really low."
3,Iffy,"Im have not been overly impressed by these headphones. I bought them thinking that they would be a serious upgrade from my previous earbuds (which are more likely to do long term damage to your hearing and those little buggers will NOT stay in your ears). Basically I thought that by buying higer quality headphones I would be doing my ears a favor both safety wise and in respect to the enjoyability factor... ummm not so much. I have been underwhelmed by these headphones. The volume does not go up high enough for my liking and the shape is too bulky (it doesn't travel well). Look I wasn't in it for the fashion (if you want to look hip DON'T by these headphones) but I was expecting some kind of trade off. Im willing to sacrifice style for substance but I found that these headphones had neither. However, I will say that the sound quality of these phones is quite good. Im willing to give them that."
2,Nice Sound but Poor Build Quality,Bought this based on online recommendations. I was very pleased with the quality of the sound but the headphones have very poor build quality. My SR60 simply fell apart after the warranty expired and any effort to make the headphones workable just wouldn't work. Now this pair of SR60's looks comical being held together with elastic bands and failed make-shift repairs. Have no choice but give two stars.
5,Customer for life,"Everything that can be said already has been. These are absolutely fantastic headphones. Every other pair I have listened to after buying these just hasn't sounded the same. Be warned, after you convert, you won't be able to go back. But it's worth it.Also, these aren't nearly as uncomfortable as everybody keeps saying. Most comfortable headphones I have owned yet after I put aftermarket pads on them. Granted I've never worn Senns, but still, they DO NOT hurt.I am sold completely, and will be a faithful Grado customer for life."
2,"the CD is awesome...the DVD, not so much","i LOVE this CD. it's a powerful worship experience every time i listen to it. but this DVD is horrible (again, in pure video quality not in the music quality). the video is extremely choppy and almost makes you dizzy because it flashes from scene to scene so much/fast.i'm a big fan of worship DVDs as a whole, but this one just isn't worth the money in my opinion."
1,"Weak, light colors",It's cheap and the cheapness shows. I was quite disappointed with the quality of the colors. Will not buy it again.
3,Not bad with one GREAT song,"I bought this album on the strength of the song 'Grover, thanks'. If this is his tribute to the great Grover Washington Jr - what a tribute it is - AMAZING. No doubt Grover must have meant a hell of a lot to Ron Fattorusso. The rest of the album in my view is ok. Nothing really special but, ""Grover thanks"" makes the album worth buying."
2,"...""A Life"" is a very suitable title for The Skeptic","Like blind men explaining the form of an elephant to the touch, Teachout has shown that one man can't possibly accomplish the task of disecting Mencken. I have read a few of Mencken's work and was hoping this book would shed more light on the man, the word, and the music that sprang to paper. All I got was a dark, tedious, and unsatisfying work that I had hoped would act as a catalyst allowing me to enjoy Mencken's craft/content/output even more. I'll stick with reading more Mencken. Hunter S. Thompson was probably a mean, cranky, reclusive loud mouth - and much like Mencken, I don't think a biography on HST would ever be as satisfying as enjoying the man and his craft on it's own merit."
4,You get what you pay for but in this case....,"You get what you pay for but in this case I was in the right place at the right time!I purchased this product when it was twenty-five dollars and as always thought... how good could it be at this price?This is my third attempt at finding a portable speaker; we've started to travel a little and it's nice to have your own tunes handy.While it's true you have to adjust the volume this is a great little system.At the present price of fifty dollars it's a great buy!I know for some people they expect the concert experiance so buy a bose system but if your looking for something simple, portable and at a good price then this might be what your looking for. I'm going to watch this product and if it drops to that twenty dollar price again I'll buy a second unit!Good luck!"
3,iPod Remote Speaker System,"I purchased this item on sale for $20 at Amazon and use it on the patio and in the garage. The case is made of shiny black plastic, the grill is silver metal, and the power brick is about 2""x2""x2"" and plugs into the back.It has plenty of volume and sound quality for outdoors (sitting on back porch or cleaning garage/car). It's also lightweight and easily portable for moving about. I agree the sound isn't perfect as noted in some other reviews, but it does not distort and it's good for how I use it.Catch it on sale and you can't go wrong, it's just a speaker with a dock and power, but it does very well for what it was designed.Cheerz/DMK"
2,I would spend a little more for better sound,"This may be fine if you are used to listening to an alarm clock radio, but if you listen to higher quality stereo, you will be disappointed. It is definitely flat sounding. I think the quality is equal to the price."
5,Great sound - surprising.,I was impressed with the sound quality these little boxes produced. I ended up selling these and the buyer has never complained after all these years!
3,for the price it's a pretty good product,I wasn't terribly upset with the quality of this speaker system. I use it in my small studio and it does the job well. It doesn't sound that great when you turn it up real loud but I don't really have the need to do that. It is super portable which I like because I occaisionally want to bring it into other rooms. For the price it's a good system.
4,Great,I love this little box! It's portable and easy to use. Remote control is great and sound is excellent.
2,Not the sound I would expect for the price,"I received one for a birthday present and was very disappointed. The sound is muffled and not at all what I would expect for the price, not even close. Maybe it sounds better with the companion, add-on speaker, but my advice...don't buy this without listening first."
4,Enjoying the speaker,"I was hesitant to order this based on the poor review, but the price was so excellent and the other reviewer liked it so I took a chance. The speaker works well and came with many pages of instructions and tips, but none were needed as it was pretty much a ""plug and play"" deal. The sound is what I was hoping for based on the wattage. I'm very glad I purchased it. If you're looking for Bose, buy Bose, but this is great for the money."
3,"For the Price, a decent purchase","Bought this for the office, since it was pretty close to the same price as an additional IPOD charger. For a single box speaker, the sound is ok - but I am in a work place, and don't put th3e volume up.It does a fine job recharging my IPOD when I forget to check at home; it's pretty unobtrusive on the desk as well."
5,I'm loving this,"I bought two during the gold box deal ($20) and gave one as a gift. I love how it has a remote and how you can listen to it while charging your ipod. When I turn it on, the noise radiates throughout the room and if loud enough, it can also through the next room. This is a great speaker, though wish it didn't require so many batteries to be portable. It's great for my use and it looks pretty good on your desk. (It works for my video ipod, but am not sure if it works with iphones)."
5,great work ihome!,this is a great device! sound quality was a little tin can at first but the remote it comes with has bass and treble puttons that actually work and you can make the sound quality really decent for the size. it is loud as well as quiet without sacrificing too much quality. the remote also lets you navigate the menue of the ipod to select songs etc. box itself has inputs for in and out (out for sound and video!) as well as coming with a coupon for a second unit that lacks the connections for like 40 bucks (i would get this). seller was also great. no complaints.
4,sdi ipod speaker,this little speaker has worked out quite well for me...i love the full function remote...the sound quality is ok- not super not terrible...i have some 2.1 computers plugged into the back for some added sound and range-that seems to add a nice dimension...overall i am very pleased with this purchase.
3,Itouch/Iphone owners beware,"To be completely honest, I bought this speaker for its low price. I also got what I paid for!Pros:1. Looks cool.2. Comparatively low price.3. The A/V port in the back allows you to hook up another speaker system to get stereo sound(see below).Cons:1. Will not control an Iphone/Itouch. Only the controls for sound work(loudness bass/treble). Though it will play music from it.2. Not Stereo. Left channel only, they expect you to buy an identical looking speaker for the right channel. Even the it is only 2.0 instead of 2.1.3. Sound requires a little bit of tweaking in order to get it to sound OK."
4,Very good for price I paid - but not very good sound,"I'm giving this unit four stars because it is a nice looking unit with decent features and I got it for a good price. However, the sound quality leaves me wanting better. I'd give the sound quality for music a 2.5 or maybe a 3 if I'm feeling generous (out of 5). However, for the price I paid I can't complain much so I'm giving it 4 stars taking price into account. Just don't expect 4 or 5 star quality sound. If you're listening to podcasts, then it should be fine but I wouldn't recommend it for listening to music unless you're not into hi-fi sound or are limited to something of this size.UPDATE: Cannot use as a computer speaker even when plugged in with the AC adapter because it seems to power itself off if there's a few minutes of no sound."
1,"Sounds horrible, but works as a docking station","First of all, I knew this thing didn't sound so hot before I bought it. I only paid $24.00 for it and rationalized that it was way cheaper than an apple dock which is $50.00. When I finally was able to listen, I could not believe this thing was actually designed by an engineer... You cannot feed left and right stereo channels into the same amplifier channel or into the same speaker coil and not expect some cancellation, but the geniuses at Soundesign did it anyway. Almost everything stereo recording you play sounds as if it is a remix, with some instruments sounded louder than or weaker than normal. It's a mess...My mono mix of the ""White Album"" sounds OK, but that's about it. The remote functions well and it does work as a dock."
1,Not worth it,"You do get what you pay for, I guess. I purchased this speaker when Amazon offered it at the $19.99 Gold box price. I'm very glad I didn't pay more for it. The sound is quite muffled despite repeated adjustments to the treble and bass. It's fine for a travel stereo but the quality is sadly lacking. It is not worth more than what I paid for it certainly. If you're looking for a better quality, light weight speaker system for iPod, I would recommend theJBL On Tour Portable Speaker System ( Black )"
4,Cant go wrong <---i take that back!!!,"Bought this as gold box deal for $20.00. Awesome, works great, and love the look and sound of it. With that price you couldn't go wrong.UPDATE-this has been tossed into the garbage stopped working after a little bit. thought it was to much of a good deal to be true. so now i would be giving it 1 star if i could edit that part of the review."
2,exegetical fallacies galore,"It's funny that a book that stresses how many others commit exegetical fallacies, should have so many itself. Almost every word study in the book is a great example of what not to do when doing a word study. Olson's knowledge of Greek is quite limited, yet one who reads it without this knowledge could be easily decieved. As is evident by the mostly good reviews.One of the most obvious mistakes was to say that the Hebrew word ""nacham"" never means repent! One only needs to use a Strong's concordance to see this is not so.While I myself am an Arminian, I don't recommend this book at all. Forlines - ""The Quest for Truth"" is much better, as well as Arminius and Richard Watson. Prbably the best chapters in Olson's book are 6 and 7. I recommend finding it in a library somewhere, and reading 6 and 7, and then puttin it back never to be read again."
1,Gutter Theology,"The only thing more amazing than the Pelagian garbage in this book is that some people read it and like it. Some people are quite stupid. Olson was a Devil plain and simple. The faulty theology flies in the face of 2000 years of orthodoxy. In fact it is mainly kept alive in YWAM, that is Youth With a Mission(actually they have no true mission) well perhaps keeping alive the ghost of Olson. The good news........most Christians with half a brain and a Bible can recognize Olson's work for what it is............sub-orthodox vomit."
1,Only so-so,"After reading the great reviews I coughed up the 60 bucks for the 48 tamale package. I was a little disappointed when they arrived, they're very small for tamales- about the size of a big cigar. I was was more disappointed when I ate them. They taste like plain fried ground beef in a corn tortilla. The masa is thin and tough and there seems to be virtually no seasoning. I'm now scratching my head wondering what to do with 40 tamales....."
4,Delicious tamales at a reasonable price,"I've ordered tamales from four different suppliers now, and Texas Tamale has been the most reliable. I have numerous food allergies, and I seem to tolerate their tamales really well. Some tamales from other places simply have too much lard in the masa....these are the least ""oily"". I've had the bean,the beef, and the chicken.....can't do the spinach due to daily products in it. I may stop from experimenting around with other companies and only stick with Texas Tamales from now on.....they really are delicious. Clever packaging, reasonable shipping."
5,Delicious!,"I used to pick these up at the grocery store when I lived in Texas, but I cannot find them in Tennessee. They are delicious - just the right proportion of meat filling to masa dough. They heat up moist and flavorful. Enjoy!!"
2,Gossipy book by somebody who wasn't even there,"This book is a collection of little gossipy vignettes told by somebody who wasn't even a bystander to the events of Nureyev's life. Stuart doesn't have an interest in the genius of Nureyev -- he was much more interested in the dancer being gay, and stretches the stories to showcase this slant of the book. I thought it was a trivial, jokey, silly book, revealing little about what made Nureyev a remarkable person. It's also fairly old, and it hasn't stood the test of time. A far better read is Julie Kavanaugh's fantastic bio, Nureyev, The Life."
5,My handy little red wagon,I bought this wagon to haul things between the car and the house and it works great. It was cheaper than anything I could find in town and the side slats have come in handy. I didn't have any trouble putting it together.
4,Classic.....,Bettye Lavette came on to my radar with her last two albums and I saw her live this summer. She has got it! Great recordings that have that 70s soul sound to bad we had to wait so long for them. Great for fans of old school soul. Can't wait for more material.
4,Stops working after a few years,"This item is nice looking and easy to install. We installed it behind a door to the back stairway and when you open and close the door the brooms will swing and bump into the door, so it's better off against a wall.It does not work well with thin, metal handles such as swifter, etc.Our back stairs area is not weathered and gets very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. After 4+ years the rubber on the balls just stiffens and stops working as designed. The brooms will slide off and block the door from opening properly.I guess replacing it every few years is a compromise given the circumstances but just be aware of that."
5,5-Position Wall Organizer,Very pleased with the design & ease of use.It just works great as the other reviews also commented. I used longer sheet rock screws & premarked the wall studs for a more secure mount.
4,Pretty great- one small issue,"I will be ordering a second one of these soon. I am however, still waiting on the magic. So far it just holds brooms and sweepers on my wall (you know, I wouldn't want those touching the floor-- after all, it's filthy).Works as advertised and any idiot could hang this system up, only thing that could use some re-engineering would be that the holders are a little too close together so you need to alternate hanging one device broom up and next broom/sweeper down and so on. No need to do so if you were hanging tools or something with smaller heads like rare Ottoman toilet plungers or something.But overall, I'm into it."
1,Poor installation,"Because of the depth of the holes for mounting, you can't use a drill to sink the holes for the anchors or use a power tool to drive the screws. The anchors themselves are so brittle that they shatter when you try to drive them into the holes. If you make the holes big enough to get the anchors in, they are liable to fall out. This products needs a mounting plate that it snaps onto to be installed."
4,Great product for the price.,This is easy to install (15 minutes) and works very well. I plan to buy another one for my garage.
4,review Evriholder Magic Holder 5-Position Wall Organizer,"this is an awesome product. very simple and easy to install. when installing be careful inserting plastic screws into wall. they only give you the exact amount that you need and if you don't insert the plastic screws correctly, they may bend or break and may prevent you from inserting the real screw into the unit. i gave it four stars because it would have been nice if they provided a couple of extra plastic screws in case they break. if this does happen, you should be able to pick up the plastic screw holders at your local hardware store. i've had no issues holding a few brooms and mops on this unit. the magic holder seems to hold everything in place without any sign of dropping anything. i'm very happy with my purchase and am considering buying a few as gifts."
5,Simplicity with Function,Simplicity with function at a reasonable cost. Easy to install and use. Good aesthetics.
5,So far so good worked great for 3 months,This was easy to install and has done a great job getting our mops and brooms off the floor. I will agree with other posts that you need to look at what you are putting in it as a wide broom will easily block other items from fitting.
3,Average product,Overall this is an average product.It serves its purpose reasonably well though not great.The hold on certain items isn't perfect and one of the slots on mine was improperly assembled.I had to disassemble and reassemble it and it's still not perfect.The plastic itself does not seem very durable.Overall it's not as nice as I expected.
1,Doesn't work for very long,"This worked great for the first month, but the grips stopped holding over time. You'd think something that you have to screw into the wall would last a bit longer, but after a few months, it was just a white thing hanging on the wall that no longer held the brooms up! Really disappointed!"
1,eventually a waste of money vs standard hooks,"My husband bought one of these somewhere to hold up the brooms and mops in the basement hallway near the kitchen. The broom or mop handles never fully gripped and slipped all the way through and then fell down the stairs of the basement. Basically useless. He put the same in the garage near the door to the house and it never would hold anything there either. The screws never stayed in the wall fully and the unit would tilt forward, looking like a cheap piece of plastic."
1,What the ...?,"What comes in the box is...just the product and a 4x7 multilingual page of ""instructions"" -- Install on pegs (supposed to be included: they aren't) --- if installing on wood, screw in..but screws aren't included.Ridiculous instructions, no list of what you'll need: drill, hammer, screwdriver, a level, and oh yeah, SCREWS AND/OR PEGS of undetermined size -- here you're on your own, mate!Grrrrrrr"
1,doesn't hold any of my handles,I can't believe that every handle of my brooms and mops are so oddly sized that they don't fit this 'universal' holder. None of them stay in place and all of them slip down to the floor eventually.
3,"Not bad, but a little close together","I guess this is just the way it has to be, but the problem is, with each broom/mop, etc. so close together, the bottoms are bigger and they are kind of squeezed with no space, it just looks messy to me... so its a nice idea, and the unit is pretty good quality, but I'm not sure it works well in real life."
1,Worst Product I ever bought,"This organizer initially was great. It held all of my brooms and 2 of my mops. However, the more you use it the more these center things get loose. I have had it for less than a year and I can't get one section to hold a broom anymore. Forget a skinny broom. It's always has problems with that. Now it's just a piece of junk and ready for the TRASH."
1,Not as expected,"The Magic Holder is not good for me. I have a fat broom and a skinny swiffer. It grabs neither. I put in a narrow broom closet thinking they would hang nice and they end up sliding down and ""sometimes"" catching by the top handle and sometimes falling out into the closet. It's too much trouble to unscrew it and return it. Also, IT IS HUGE! Should have had it when I was home on the farm."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,"This product gave me so much more room in my cleaning closet. I highly recommend you spend the money and put it up, you will not regret it."
5,Great space saver,"It took all of 2 minutes to mount this wall organizer, and now our utility room appears to have grown in size due to the fact that all of our brooks and mops are out of the way on the wall. It's a piece of cake to get stuff off the organizer and put it back, so this was a great buy for us. It comes with a variety of screws for different installation methods (stud only, drywall toggle bolts, and molly/screw), which is pretty handy."
4,tricky to install,"Bit tricky to install as you have to line up 5 mollies - harder then it sounds in this caseOnce on, the unit is solid and its very easy to use - so worth the effort"
5,Does what it is supposed to.,Nice product. It looks good and holds the mop and broom as it is supposed to. Helps make my laundry room look more organized. I like the way it adjusts to fit any size handle--good design.
5,5 Position Magic Holder,"This is a wonderful product. ""Get Organize"" and ""Amazon"" are great companies to deal with for on-line products."
1,Can't hold my mop and broom,"Installed easy, it would hold a very light broom. But it couldn't hold the mop and the regular broom. Very dissapointed"
3,package did not include screws or anchors,I finally got time to hang up this organizer only to find out there are not screws or anchors in the box. I looked at the instructions and it clearly says screws and anchors should be included. Hopefully I can find screws that will fit at my expense.
2,PIA to install,"drilling 7 holes into the wall, mollies to hold the screws...not worth it! shouldn't need so much for holding brooms and mops"
3,Good organizer,"I like the idea to organize my cleaning tools - brushes, etc. It holds 5 items - only big heavy mop slides down often."
5,better than expected!,"Great item, it is performing better than expected after reading other reviews. It will only hold pole type cleaning items, no dust pans or small brushes. No problem with any of the items falling. Smooth and easy to hang and remove items. Would purchase again. It does require you to drill about 5 holes to mount the item to your wall or cabinet."
3,"Works, But Tricky To Use","I had one of these already installed in an apartment I moved into. I was initially happy to see it, helpful to use for extra storage. However, I had thought 3 of the 'joints' were already broken; the loose balls that would grip the handle were jammed into the main unit, and would not slide down to grab the handles. I recently figured out how to fix it, by simply working at the rubber ring that had come loose and get the ball joint out again, then replacing the rubber ring into the slot it belonged in. Not sure how often this will happen, but now that I know it can be fixed, it's not a big deal. It WOULD be nice if it had the ability for short, wider handles."
4,Holds brushes neatly,Does what it's supposed to do and is very easy to use. It saves space on the floor and organises the kitchen in such a neat way.
5,Nice little broom holder,"Fairly easy to mount.. you have to use something small to mark where the holes in the wall go, but not to difficult.No springs or parts to break.. seems fairly simple and is very effective for a small broom to a swifter wet jet."
3,It's alright,"This is a pretty good idea, but the pegs are too close to each other. If you have blucky brooms or shovels or other items than its a little hard to keep them all seperate. Also, it doesn't hold that much weight before you're worried that its going to fall. But other than that not a bad idea and/or tool."
4,"no instructions, but still worth it",This makes keeping my closet organized so much easier. There wasn't any sort of instructions or even a screwdriver (luckily I had one). That made me take a star off. I still think it's worth the purchase!
5,Simplicity itself.,I used to have my brooms in a barrel. Falling every where every time I grabbed one and the others overbalanced. This is so much better.
4,Works great but is lacking,"This item is a little sturdier and better quality then a similar item sold at various department stores, but unlike the cheaper item, this one does not have little hooks and towel holders. So if the hooks and towel holders are important to you, then you're better off going with the cheaper version. If looks and quality matter more, get this one. I give this four out of five stars."
5,Love It!,I had been searching all stores for a way to organize my mops and brooms. This really does the trick. It has a good grip on handles of all sizes and nothing has ever slipped from the holder. It's very easy to install and even easier to use. I definitely recommend this product.
1,Breaks easy,"We purchased a two pack of these holders for our garage. Initially, we were excited about the product. It installed easily and held most of our tools, brooms, mops, and such. Like another posted suggested, our Swiffer and other small handle tools did not fit. What really disappointed me was that very quickly; some of the springs/rubber bands/balls broke and no longer held any broom, etc. Now, I'm in the market for a new storage system so that our brooms, mops, etc. are not on the ground. I would recommend getting something with less moving parts to break."
4,Works well but has logistical issues,"Although maybe a little too plastic looking for public display, it is a more elegant solution than most I have seen. Works well at holding brooms and they are easy to remove, but since the slots are closely spaces, you need to stagger the heads of brooms, tools or mops, so don't expect them all to line up neatly. It also means that when you remove one, it may knock others out of their slot. So don't count on this to really hold 5 brooms or mops unless you are willing to do some strategic planning to make them all fit that close together."
2,kind of a hassle to use,"It's hard to describe in writing, but the rolling cylinders with the rubber ""O"" rings just don't work very well! It's not a good design. The ""O"" rings keep jumping out of the groove and this causes the rollers to get stuck up inside the housing. See what I mean about this being hard to describe? You'd understand in a second if I could post a picture. Ah well! I tried glueing the ""O"" rings into the grooves and that helped a bit. But the long and short of it is this thing is a pain to use and I recommend you shop for some other kind of mop holder."
4,"Not perfect, but good","This system has a mechanical component with grippers and cogs that work better than just rubber grippers. But one of the rubber grippers comes off the track and has to be fixed regularly. Other than the one slot, it works great."
5,Great organizer,"Love it. My broom closet has never been more organized. It keeps broom, swifter, etc off the floor. Leaves floor room for other things. Easy to install. Would recommend."
4,Not bad!,I live in Florida and struggle with rust and corosion on all equipement. This holders seems to do the job and quite easy to place tools into it. Would definitely buy again.
5,Perfect for small closets!!,"I LOVE IT! It was easy to hang and is so easy to use. I used this in the coat closet where I keep cleaning products - I have a swiffer sweeper, a swiffer wet jet, a broom, a dustpan, and a swiffer vac hanging all in one place! I am impressed that the grip is strong enough to hold the heavier swiffer wet jet and vac. I am doing a lot of re-organization of the spaces in my home and I have a feeling I'll find a few more spots where I can use one of these - so I'm sure I'll be ordering more in the future! It is nice that it can hold items that have varying widths on the poles - it fits snug to several sizes. It keeps everything off the floor in our closet and nothing ever falls over anymore. It looks so neat and tidy. I'm very impressed with this product and I think everyone could benefit from having at least one of these in their home!"
5,Love it!,"Have used this product before and loved it so much wanted more. Amazon had a great price, and easy delivery. The holders are so flexible, hold whatever broom, mop, dustpole, etc. you put in stays in place. Love it."
2,Not good,Don't buy it. It's not working!!!You try to hung something on it and it won't hold it. Even if it's a light object.
1,Hate it,I wish I could return this but my husband uses it and won't take it off the wall. I do NOT use it myself because I do NOT like it at all.
3,Average Game For Sonic Fans.,"This is a very cool game. Play as 8 characters in story mode (Sonic, Tails, Rogue, Knucles, Shadow, Amy, Cream, Emerl).When your fighting you will use the same attacks over and over, and they do get boring at times. The 2d rectangles in fighting are pretty cool! But once you have beaten the game you can't really play much more. In story mode you can customize Emerl's attacks by mixing other character's attacks. You can also fire ground shots or special attack. This game also includes multi player mini games and one boring single player. Story mode provides a small challenge and it talks half the time. Don't bythis game but if you wanna go ahead."
4,This is the best sonic game ever,"Since sonic was released on sega I've never seen a better game, But let me get one thing strait, this is a FIGHTING game, Not racing, that you can move around on the screen and it has the grafics of a plastation game. To all Sonic fans or RPG fans or even wrestling fans buy this game! You won't regret it."
2,What a Dissapointment,"While fun for a while, it gets tiresom after a while. I stopped playing by the time I got to the point in Rouge's quest where you have to beat her 5 times as Emerl, but if she beat you even once, you have to start the entire fight over again! So if you beat her 4 times,then she beats you, you're forced to fight her again!All I can say is this: Ignore and buy ""Super Smash Bros. Melee"" for your Gamecube instead,even if it doesn't have Sonic."
4,what a game!!!,look i never played sonic battle but it souns sooooooo FUN!! i am a HUGE! sonic fan and this game just looks radical i wish i could buy it beating the crap outta people with sonic sounds like a heck of a fun game to me heres the games grades SOND:? GAMEPLAY:? GRAPHICS:? uh hello!!!!!!!! remember i never played this game but buy it if youze a a sonic fan... buy it buy it buy it! aw great not another solar wind storm see... AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!
5,help!!!!!,This game rocks out of all of them in the world all the charaters rock!!!!!!! I'm on Knuckles but I'm stuck I can't beat those three black robots oh well i'll try again any way sonic rules his games rules uhhhh.... sonic rules I love him not in a kissy way but you know what i'm talking about. This is the game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!buy it!!!!!!!!!!!
3,It's really fun....at first.,"This game is great. You can fight as Sonic characters. The gameplay is great as well. But there's some downfalls. Everything's in 2-D! But what I'm most upset about is that once you do Amy's Adventure game,it's almost impossible. Emerl is neat but sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo weak. When Amy,Cream and Emerl are doing a fight,you are Emerl. You stink,no matter what level he's at. The story is very intresting though. Overall,I'd say this game is great for a little bit."
3,Good Game,This game is not as good as the other sonic games. You have to battle a lot of people and the battles can be boring
3,"Great movie, terrible video quality","I saw this movie first back in late 90's when it was released and remembering loving it, the characters, and the musical score and soundtrack. I thought having a DVD at home would be awesome.Apart from the fact that what seemed fascinating at age 16 now seems funny 13 years later, I was very very disappointed in the quality. Maybe these things don't scale good to LCD screens but still this is the worst ""original"" DVD print I have ever seen. The whole thing looks grainy and I remember it looking much better when I first saw it in the VHS format, even though the screen was much worse.DVD navigation is a joke too. If you select a song, the movie continues after it is done. So I can't just watch all songs in a playlist.Finally, the movie is preceded and followed by crappy ads/trailers for other stuff available on DVD.The whole DVD looks poorly produced. Will think twice before buying a EROS entertainment product again."
5,Blue Buffalo Weight Control,"My dog loves this food. As soon as I feed him he scarfs it down. He would sniff his old food and eventually get around to eating it, not w/ this food. He absolutely love it. I will definitely be buying this again."
2,Where's the meat,I love and my dogs love blue buffalo...but this particular bag was mostly life source bits. (compared to the last bag I bought. Lets put it this way...poured 1 cup and only 10 pieces of meat bits and the rest life source bits. Can't possibly be healthy and has made me a little gun shy of ordering this particular version of dog food.
2,Only for Dentists,"I was hoping this book would suit other head and neck specialists eg ENT Trainees. Unfortunately it's a little light on areas other than the mouth with a heavy focus on dental areas. I know the blurb on the jacket says this suits dental people but I was hoping for more detail throughout the head and neck - otherwise they should have called this book ""Anatomy of the Head and Neck for dentists"".If you're a dentist, oral hygeinist or therapist, or dental student you'll find this book very useful. For everyone else, don't bother."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was hoping for a program for music notation, that is one that allows me to enter the notes and lyrics via computer rather than doing it by hand which is messy at best and impossable to read at worst. This program is, in my humble oppinion not worth the money as blank manuscript paper is not at all expensive and this program is outdated and has compatablity issues with both windows vista and windows 7. Save your money for a better program you will be happier."
1,Big difference between this and an Epson,"This cartridge lasted 1/3 the time an Epson lasts. It was a hassle having to repeatedly tell my computer that it was okay to use a non-Epson cartridge. About 25% of the time the cartridge wasn't even acknowledged as having been installed, so I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. Yes, it printed, after all of that, but with no noticable difference in quality, a HUGE difference in quantity, and with considerable aggravation."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"This is the second one I've bought, and I should have learned my lesson the first time - the first one smeared black ink over the pages every now and then - a big waste of ink and dirtied up the inside of the printer. This one isn't even being recognized by the printer - it keeps saying there's a foreign object inside and I need to take it out. Don't waste your money, please."
4,"Reliable, but big","This machine seems to be reliable and sturdy, and does a fine job of playing CDs with clear reproduction. The carousel design seems easier to deal with than the plastic magazine cartridges I had to cope with in the Yamaha CD player I had been using.The only drawback is the size of the case. It's large enough to cause a problem fitting into the wooden cabinet, where the older machine fit confortably. Potential buyers should measure their available space before purchasing the Denon."
4,Tragedy's Flip Side,"Writing the Comedy by Stuart Voytilla and Scott Petri is an excellent primer on how to pen screenplays that make us laugh. The authors' exploration into the nature of tragedy's flip-side gives away all comedy's secrets, concluding that the rules to creating good comedy, through the basic tenets of conflict, character development, plotting and story premise, apply to drama too. So look at the book as a two for one package on how to write masterful screenplays of any genre."
2,caution other reviews,"I would give this book 2.5, but you can't give half stars. It had to be 2 rather than 3, because I think all the other reviews are written by the writer's mates. The book has some value, but is poorly structure, spends too much time talking about standard screenwriting form and illustrates points inadequately pointing to only a few films to make each point."
4,Nice Overview of Comedic structures in Movies,"I was very impressed by Stuart Voytilla's Myth and the Movies: Discovering the mythic structure of 50 unforgettable films and I was excited to see that he also had a book that he co-authored on comedy in film. The book is well arranged, and if you are willing to engage the text honestly--meaning you have to watch the films that are referenced in the text--the book is quite helpful for comedy writers or people who just want a better understanding of how and why comedy works."
1,deceiving advertisement,"The item reads ''Fisher-Price Digital Arts and Crafts Studio-Go Diego Go '' showing a pic of some sort of same computer looking toy. That was not at all what I received. I got a CD that must be use with this computer like toy. Futhermore, the price on the package states 3.79, the advertised price is 6.00. The CD is absolutely useless to me. If anyone can tell me how to get in touch with this vendor I'd really appreciated it. Cuz, WHAT A RIP OFF!!!"
4,"Kids love drawing, coloring, printing projects","I purchased the Digital Arts and Crafts Studio about 4 years ago. It has been used by 2 girls over that time and they will still pull it out to draw. They are now 8 and 10. I purchased additional software titles last year to add more interest. We have Barbie, Dora, Diego, and dinasaurs. The basic crafts are really cool too. Make party hats with your own designs, crowns for your royal princesses, greeting cards, party invitations. We've done most of the crafts over the years. My girls would tell you to buy it."
1,FP digital arts,I did not know that this piece was dependent on having a certain basic device. it is worthless as is and costs more to return than to throw away which is what I will do.
3,For School Purposes,"I bought this for a school report. I found the book somewhat redundant and hard to get through, but over all it is a great overview of American slavery as compared to Russian serfdom and Carribean slavery. Great for undergraduates and book reports. Learned a lot!"
5,A VERY TOUCHING STORY,"I just finished reading 'SECRET LOVE' by Louis Nizzari. It was one of the most touching books I have read. I am an avid reader, averaging three to four books a month. I would put this book at the top of my favorites. I couldn't put it down until I finished reading it. This book brings out every emotion possible. I highly recommend it to every one of all ages. It will teach you the true meaning of love and devotion."
5,AMD Athlon-64 Dual Core,"I got the AMD Athlon-64 X2 Dual-Core 4200+ Processor Socket 939 as a upgrade to my computer. The Product was to replace a single core older AMD Athlon 64 Socket 939 processor in my computer. Does it work, well I am writing this review now. Installation was easy. I got my particular CPU used, so it lacked the heatsink/fan and thermal grease. So those buyers who getting there own CPU make sure you have (or is ordering) thermal compound and a heatsink/fan unit."
1,Never showed...,"The seller ""changed their mind"" after I purchased it and did a ""Oh, I'm sorry, we didn't mean to sell it at that price""...It's more...If you want to buy it at the NEW higher price please let us know.. What a way to do business...Never again."
1,What a piece of crap,"This product is useless.The part where the bottle's nozzle rests, bends down when I insert the bottle.It bends so far down that the top of the bottle is set BELOW the spring that is supposed to hold the bottle in place.The spring itself broke right off almost despite how careful I was.Stay away from Sun Seed."
2,Not what you expect,"I bought this cd thinking someone interviewed the guys but its nothing like I expected. A woman, who you can barely understand, reads their background info. *NSYNC says nothing on this cd and there are no songs on it. The information is true and if you wanna know more about the start of nsync, buy it I guess. It does get boring after a while!! The guys who introduce *NSYNC aren't even them. They dont even sound like NSYNC. If I knew what this was b4 i bought it, I wouldn't have bought it......thats my opinion"
2,Umm...ok??,"Alrighty, I don't know what the heck the other reviewers are talking about. This cd has no songs on it. It is ALL biographys. The interviewer is British and you have to listen closely to understand her. *NSYNC isn't even on here during any part of the interview. All the guys say is, for example, ""Hi, this is Christopher Alan Kirkpatrick. My nickname is lucky beacause I'm Irish."" That's all, seriously. And the voices don't really even sound like them. Maybe its because it was recorded before they were famous...dun know. But if I heard this before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it. Its kinda, well, boring. Who wants to keep listening to the same biography over and over? The best part of this is the free mini poster that comes in the case, but still, the pic is from 6-7 years ago. lol. Thats just my 2 cents. IF you like to spend money and wanna know more on how nsync got started...then go ahead and buy it.---only 55 minutes long, no songs, no guys, just a lady talkin!!"
4,Interesting...,"This CD is kind of neat. It's a little long and *unless you're an *NSYNC fan like me* a bit boring. I think that if you don't like *NSYNC...well, you probably won't buy this. I hope if you do like them that you do like the CDs, too."
5,Wowsers!,"This is a few years old; but it is one of the most perfectly balanced albums I have ever heard. I'm an amateur producer and I listen to hundreds of songs; but this album has some of the best pure britpop I can remember enjoying. Just listen to ""Policeman and Pirates"" or ""The Riverboat Song"" to see why. Cheers!"
5,excellent band and excellent music,"This band really has something, and if they were known here in America, their careers would sky rocket!!! All their albums are pretty good, and the imports are definately worth their price!!!"
5,"Amazing, A Britpop classic Cant get Much better","With a so called ""britpop scene"" going on Ocean Colour Scene stand high above with others like Radiohead,Oasis,Blur,Pulp,Suede and manic street Preachers among others.I can easily compare Moseley Shoals to classics like Revolver(The Beatles),Exile on Main St.(Rolling stones) mixed with new albums like Defenitley Maybe(Oasis) and many others. The lyrics are amazing like Bob Dylan. Be sure to get this"
5,Get blown away,"I normally write in depth reviews to justify an albums worth. But this album needs very little justification, all it needs is to be heard for any justification.""The Riverboat Song"", ""The Day We Caught The Train"", ""The Circle"" and ""You've Got It Bad"" all of them singles are reason enough for this albums status as the fan favourite. But ""Fleeting Mind"", ""One For The Road"", ""It's My Shadow"", ""The Downstream"" and ""Get Away"" backs the claim up even more.Not forgetting ""40 Past Midnight"", ""Policemen & Pirates"" and the gorgeous ""Lining Your Pockets"".Every song is a classic OCS song. On a classic album. It's worth it based solely on the singles, but to get 8 songs that are equally as commercial as the singles and also as well written and recorded I would jump on this album quickly!"
1,just for some balance,"Sorry to burst the (5 star) bubble: this is unmitigated crap.That it's derivative, dated, pastiche is just my own hang-up- the truly insulting thing is the reverence for something that just didn't exist: NOW is worth celebrating, not a time already gone. Make your own monuments, don't adopt others."
4,A milestone in the evolutionary medicine field.,"In spite of the author's disclaimer, this is not a divulgation book. It is a technical work. A very detailed, well reasoned, with a lot of notes and examples when are needed.It is a book respected by the medical profession, at least by the most open minded part of it, although evolutionary medicine is not well accepted by many in the medical profession. It departs from the mechanicist approach until recently prevalent in Medicine.The book dissects several well known maladies (malaria, AIDS) and explains them from the darwinist point of view, with spectacular success."
3,"Heavy reading, not very enjoyable.","Evoultion of Infectious Diseases by Paul Ewald, in my opinion, is not a very good book. The author makes a compilation of all the research done in the past years on several infectious diseases but he lacks narrative. Too much data makes it heavy to read and quite boring. Even though, the book presents an extensive bilbliography which might prove useful for research."
5,Excellent bio,"Really a great biography of the man. Chernow does a great job showing the true genius of Hamilton. He really was the American Mozart and was essential in forming the government of the early republic.I do notice, after reading this book, Washington: A Life (also by Chernow) and John Adams (by David McCullough), that Thomas Jefferson was a bit of a nut and was at least borderline guilty of sedition and maybe even treason at least a few times throughout the 1790's. It's a wonder why he's celebrated as much as he is in the modern day until you realize just how good he was at intrigue and manipulation. Kind of a shame that the reputations of Adams and Hamilton haven't been as good as Jefferson's for the past couple hundred years."
3,Alexander Hamilton Book,"This book came in the condition described. You can definitely tell it is a used book, but it does not have any writing inside and it seems to have been taken care of."
1,Kindle edition is flawed,The biography is great (as the reviews attest) but the Kindle edition is flawed and the reading experience is severly compromized: one can't click on a footnote to get to it.
2,Pricing,Price too high I will not purchase an e-book over 9.99. no thanks. not when there are free stuff out there and not when there are stuff out there for 9.99 Oh. BTW. I have read this book but I would like a search able version. stop raping your customers.Overall the book was interesting as heck. this election was more violent in terms of verbage than ours.
1,Good Effort But a Very Boring Book,"I loved Chernow's book Titan. The writing was wonderful and I found out a lot about John D. I went out and purchased this book and I am sorry I did. It is really boring and Chernow's subject seems distance, stale and lacks of life. The book needs a good editor!! Some may look at the size of this book and conclude it is great, but if they would only read the book they would think differently. Finally, do we really need another book about Alex Hamilton? I dont think so. Books that are very good that really do tell good stories would be John Adams, by McCullough and Ben Franklin, Carl Van Doran. Check these out for a good read."
5,Fantastic!,"Great biography of Alexander Hamilton. It's actually a great time to be reading the biographies of the founding fathers given the current political situation in the US now. First of all, people attribute quotes or ideas to Hamilton, Jefferson and Washington all the time so better to find out what happened from a historically accurate source. The book goes into detail about his life but also about the politics of the times. Fascinating discussion about the constitution, etc. and what it actually takes to get things done in Washington, then as much as now."
5,Great read,My nephew recommended this book to my husband. He said it's full of information he was never aware had happened.
5,"Excellent research, very well written",Reading this book was quite a positive experience. I could tell that Ron really did his homework. I liked how he told Hamilton's in the context of other people and other events. Highly recommended.
5,180 people have already said this book rocks...,"I am #181. This biography blew me away. Athough the duel and outcome were not a surprise to say the least (I live in Weehawken, for one), I found myself crying my eyes out for Hamilton in the end. Add a half a star to the 5 if you've been a New Yorker -- because your enjoyment will be that much greater.My only problem was not with Chernow -- it was that the print was small and the huge paperback unwieldly. As I read this while pregnant, I found reading this particular book physically challenging and would take breaks with other books. But as the book was amazing and I vowed I'd finish it before I launched, I reached the finish line in month 9.Hurrah for Hamilton and Chernow!"
5,The Best of the Founding Father Biographies,"There is not much I can add to the other effusive reviews. This really is as good as biography gets. If you are a fan of McCullough and Ellis, you will love this book. Perhaps even more. I did. This is a near-800-page page-turner, that I simply could not put down. It is the best of the modern Founding Father biographies. And while you might differ if you are, say, a Jeffersonian, no matter your political perspective, you will inevitably find yourself saying ""wow."" I bought multiple copies in hardcover and gave them to all in my family."
5,Hamilton comes alive,"I purchased this from another book seller,when I was looking for something on Hamilton. I was interested in learning about the founder of modern banking.Ron Chernow delivered a whole lot more. He brought to life one of the most underrated and forgotten of the founding fathers. I could hardly put this book down as Chernow took me from Hamilton's Childhood to his eventual death at the hands of Arron Burr. But, there are many surprises along the way including Hamilton's service in the Continental army and his role in implementing the constitution. There are also a few others. I don't know what it is about Chernow's writing but it keeps the reader engaged and wanting more. The book is written at a level that is probably too advanced for kids. But I think this is a must read for High school seniors and above."
5,satisfied customer,"Satisfied with this purchase. Great biography. I reccommend it. Hamilton was an extradinary man, who played a very important part in the founding of our country, but who also had a very dark side to him. Chernov is an excelent story teller. You will not be able to put this book down."
5,Fascinating book,"I found this book riveting. Ron Chernow has obviously done so much research. He shows Alexander Hamilton to be an absolutely fascinating character. He was a great orator and writer. He had to fight the image people had of him being a monarchist. Although a brilliant person, he let his ego rule and ended up dying at a very young age in the infamous duel. He rose from totally humble beginnings to become the first Secretary of the Treasury. This book is so rich in detail that you will know everything there is to know about Alexander Hamilton and his relationships with all the founding fathers. I highly recommend it."
5,Alexander is a self made fearless HERO,Buy this book and see what real men are made of. Well written and spell binding.
4,A Good Read!,"An excellent book, and a rattling good story. As a Brit I have learned much about the United States. So much intrigue: it is a wonder the new nation ever took hold! Fully recommended - all 731 pages!"
5,Alexander Hamilton: An outstanding biography of an outstanding man,"Ron Chernow's monumental biography of one of the great men of American history is, frankly, not an easy read. That's not a reflection on Ron Chernow's writing, but on the enormity and importance of the events documented. It's almost more to be studied than read. It's not just a biography (warts amd all)of this amazing man (of illegitimate birth on an obscure Caribbean island who rose to be unquestionably the most important American who never became president), but it is a history of the period with superb glimpses into the lives many other giants of the Revolutionary Period--Washington, Adams, Madison, Jefferson, Burr, Monroe among others--as they interacted with Hamilton.Allow at least a couple of weeks to read Alexander Hamilton. It'll be worth it.Phillips Huston"
5,changed my mind about hamilton,"I read this because I had a long standing white-hot hatred of Hamilton, so much so that it amused my friends. One of them suggested I read this book to get a different perspective, and it really did turn me around a bit. Hamilton is still a political fool, but he's a military and financial genius, and the USA would be much worse off without him."
2,beyond the facts,I purchased the Hamilton book because I thought Chernow did a good job with Washington but I stopped reading when he suggested that Hamilton may have had one or possibly two male lovers. This is nothing less than gossip and it really has no place in a serious study of such a great man's life. If Hamilton were alive to defend himself I'm afraid Chernow would find himself in Burr's place facing a man who may aim more carefully this time.If Hamilton had a weakness it was women. Married with seven children and led into adultry by a beautiful younger woman.
3,Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow,"This book was very readable. However, the author had nothing good to say about many of our founding fathers, especially Jefferson. He kept referring to the Republican Party which I found very confusing since the Republican party was not established until 1854. Also, during the Whiskey Rebellion, the author sided with Hamilton in setting the newly established army onto the citizens of Pennsylvania because they wouldn't pay the tax. The author even noted that whiskey at that time was a form of currency and these people were using it as a means to keep body and soul together. But the author seemed to think, that the government needed it more than these people. I felt that the author had a love affair with Hamilton and government."
5,A thoroughly captivating look at a brilliant but flawed man.,Most people have no ideas of the vast influence Hamilton had on the structure of our government and banking systems. He is best remembered for his unfortunate duel. This biography takes you through his fascinating life in his brilliance and his foibles.
5,Alexander Hamilton,"After reading biographies of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, I didn't think much of Alexander Hamilton. It is easy to see, now, why Adams and Jefferson resented and envyed Alexander Hamilton. An incredibly brilliant man who didn't hide his light under a bushel, he was valued by George Washington as an almost indespensible member of his war team, cabinet, and circle of associates.Ron Chernow's exhaustive biography gave me new insight into Hamilton, his fellow founding fathers, and the whole revolutionary period. I offer my extreme thanks for his research and his insights. I read the final chapters on an airplane and was overcome with emotion when I read about his final hours.Again, Ron Chernow, thank you!Tom ThompsonParker, Colorado"
5,Wonderful biography,"Chernow's Alexander Hamilton is a wonderfully written and narrated biography; sometimes as personal and compelling as fiction. It's long and detailed, but my interest never lagged. I felt surprised at the mysteries surrounding the fatal duel; Chernow speculates between two extremes: that Hamilton may have felt depressed and resigned to death, or that he may have expected a harmless ritual in the routine defense of honor. Other than that loose end, for which there may be no definitive answer, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book and learning about the man who had such a great hand in shaping the government of the new United States."
5,THE DEFENCE OF AH,"In his new book, Ron Chernow sets the achievement record straight on one of our lesser-known founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton. The book goes well beyond the brilliance and foresight of Hamilton in his work as our country's first Secretary of the Treasury.In this biography, Chernow gives us a rich historical background of Hamilton's significant imprint on the American Revolution, the establishment of our government and the sharply divided disputes that took place between most of the founding fathers and Hamilton.Wielding his power and influence as Secretary of the Treasury, Chernow shows us where the extreme dislike arose between Hamilton and Jefferson, finally resulting in Washington interceding and requesting both parties to put aside their differences for the betterment of the young country.If you enjoy history or politics or both, Hamilton by Ron Chernow is a book to read."
5,Excellent,"After reading ""1776"" I had a taste for more information from this era. This book covered not only 1776, but the years before it and the decades after it. All of the founding brothers are examined and discussed. It was also an intensely interesting read. I was sad when the book ended, and now have new respect for Mr. Hamilton."
4,Great Read,"Chernow did an excellent job in this composition. At the end you really get a feel for who Hamilton was. The author did a great job of connecting you to him so that you really got to know Hamilton, and by the end you were sad that the book was over.A great historical biography, although Chernows vocabulary had me running to a Merriam Webster quite often. Not sure if Ron has a really broad vocabulary, or was just being pedantic.That's the only criticism of the book. If you really want to know who Hamilton was, this is the book for you.Very well written."
3,A useful intoduction to Linux,"This CD contains a version of linux that can be run on any PC without the stress of the usual linux installation. It gives the user an opportunity to test fly linux before deciding to do a full scale installation, which can be quite difficult."
4,Purchase Ubuntu OS 6.06,"Great product. Ubuntu 6.06 is a Linux OS, less crashes and BSOD, I haven't any thus far. Try the Live CD, you can boot straight from the CD without altering your present OS. Even in a MS Window environment, no damage or altering of the Window OSAmazon is also a great place to purchase items. Great service and quick shipping. I love it !!!!! Give them a serious tryThumb up guys.edwin"
2,I haven't been able to install it yet.,"I, unfortunately, have been unable to install this productBecause my DVD burner is not bootable, but hooked to a USB porton my PC. I heard of a program to make this bootable, but, alas, haven't had the time yet to experiment."
5,Best Win to Lin migration distro.,"Very little learning curve with Ubuntu. Starts right into the Gnome desktop with no fiddling. A free ""live cd"" download can be had to try on your system to make sure everything works. You can install from the live-cd but I encourage you to go for this DVD. Many more applications are included on the dvd than on the live-cd version. Only one minor complaint, I had to tinker with the sound settings to get the sound working. This was minor considering that DSL and WIFI worked right out of the box."
5,Good clean family fun,"I love Jerry Clower. I have ladies night once a month and I put him on until all the ladies show up and we just have a blast laughing and relaxing. We are all at that age where we know what he is talking about. When you need to unwind, put him on. They say laugher is good for the soul and you burn calories also. :)"
2,how about a real experiment?,"Here's an alternative idea: choose some random people, say the reviewers here, give them lot of money, houses, cars, etc., and follow them for a year. What do you think will happen to them? This would be much more interesting then looking at rich people and discussing what they should do and how. The show follows in steps of many others dealing with the same issue and the only reason for people to watch is that everyone wants to be there themselves."
3,Catch as catch can,"This collection is 5 hours long. It is exactly like the old arcade game with the claw that you use to get that toy in the bin. It almost works and you almost get it till it falls. Another fifty cents. These shows are what the Brits call a 'lorry load' where they just dump whatever into the camera field and hope it's entertaining. What you get, then, is some humour, some drama, a lot of bitching (the best part), some old-fashioned gossip, and even some PG13 sexiness. The problem is that there IS a camera and it isn't invisible or hidden. How sincerely happy, sad, funny, or sexy could YOU get with a lens recording it for the nation? Yes, I thought so.This is strictly for 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' fans, if you know that reference...If you enjoy spying on people or like soap operas, then grab this up. If not, save your money and get real (i.e. scripted) entertainment..."
3,Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard,"An amazing program, although I did not achieve the voice recognition percentage as high as other reviewers. My spoken words were recognized abut 80% of the time."
1,What a shame,"This product types words that aren't even close to what you're saying. It really was a waste of time and money. I purchased the headset microphone to go along with the software and it was even worse. I'm not a hard person to please, and I never write reviews, but this product is ridiculous, buyers please don't waste your money."
1,no time to learn,software installs easy enough but requires over 6 full hours to begin opperation I never found the time to get it working...
3,"Latest Dragon is good, but could have been great","I have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking for some time, starting with version 3 and then upgrading to version 6. And now version 9. Unfortunately the whole command setup has changed from six and there is very little information in the booklet to help me adapt. Recognition has improved, but I hate the headset that came with v9."
4,Time saver & speech coach,"When I've tried speech recognition products in the past they were cumbersome and any time savings was lost in correcting errors. With Natuarally Speaking there is still a learning process of how to use the tool and its many capabilites (like editing), but it is definitely a powerful, time-saving tool. It also has helped me see where my spoke word is unclear, so that I can start reworking how I communicate. Thus it has also become a speech coach."
3,Dragon NaturallySpeaking is Dragging Me Down,I m using dragon naturally speech two type this preview . it wall take much work to get it two bee faster than i can type...needs mac oh sss ex version
1,Microphone,"I write books and decided to try this productInstallation StepsSet up microphone volumeVolume set up completeQuality not satisfactory, Do againSince the reviews said Customer Service was so bad I did not even try to contact the vendor for a resolution.Returned the product to AmazonAuthor of al-Qaeda Strikes Again"
1,won't install on XP x64,I asked before buying and was told that although Dragon wouldn't install on Vista 64-bit OS it would work with XP 64-bit...but it doesn't.
2,Still not there,This product has come a long way but falls short on expectations. You end up spending more time correcting the errors then if you just typed it out in the first place.
1,Couldn't train,"I tried to train software to recognize a specific a word. No go button or any other button appeared on the training box, and so I could not train the software. I searched nuance knowledge base and Google for this problem but could not find it."
3,Dragon probelms,"The program is fine and works fine with one exception: I constantly get a screen filled with a display to register my version of the program.I registered the program the same day I received it. If this error had not been present it would have received a 4 out of 5 rating. As it stands currently, and until MY personal copy is fixed, the rating is correct, the program falls short of my expectations and needs to be repaired and improved to accept what it is told to do, and never to remind you to register ever again.Respectfully,Dr. Craig A. BenhamGraphics & Imaging Computer Services"
3,Amazon did not stand behind their advertising,"The product was as expected, but the $40 rebate promised by Amazon was not given. I even called them and the customer service representative said that he would personally take care of it and e-mail me back within 4 days. I never heard from him again."
3,Just a warning: DOES NOT WORK WITH USB MIC,"This is not about the quality of the product (I am using version 7, and it is actually quite good, so I expect version 9 to be even better), but just a warning:DOES NOT WORK WITH USB MICROPHONE!I just bought the standard version, found this information in the manual, and returned it right away, as my computer does not work with the regular mic (adds way too much noise). According to the manual, the preferred version does work with a USB mic, so I ordered it instead.I just wonder why they can't write this on the outside of the box and into their product specifications."
1,Not compatible,I TRIED FOR ABOUT A WEEK TO INSTALL THIS PROGRAM AND COULDN'T GET IT IN MY SYSTEM. I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING IN FAQ THAT SAYS IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XP MEDIA EDITION. WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THAT BEFORE I ORDERED IT.
3,Get Preferred Edition,"Pros: Fast, accurate, intuitive, inexpensiveCons: Missing vital feauresNuance has deliberately ommitted some basic functionality from the Standard edition. I found this out the hard way. When dictating for a half hour or more, the program locks up and displays an error about reaching the limit of its data capacity. According to the Nuance online knowledgebase, this is rectified by changing a simple setting in the program options of Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9. What they did not indicate however, is that in the Standard edition THERE IS NO WAY TO DO THIS! Something as simple as being able to allocate more than a half hour's worth of hard drive space is not possible in this program. You will have to stop dictating, exit the program, and restart the program to get another run. Nuance customer service's solution was for me to buy the Preferred edition to gain the freedom to determine my own max data size."
3,Buggy but great,"let me start by saying that I am using NaturallySpeaking type this review.I have been using NaturallySpeaking since version 1.0. This version is clearly the best one yet. I can talk as fast as I want with nearly 100% accuracy.Having said that, I'm using a very fast computer (dual Opteron). I'm also using a very expensive microphone (Sennheiser).Take the time to read the manual and do the training. Correct your mistakes and the program will learn from it.I am troubled by the bug prohibiting me from updating it. This is been mentioned by other users here and I won't dwell on it. Suffice it to say that I expect free support when the issue is a software bug."
4,Much Improvement over Dragon Naturally Speaking 8,The program seems to be much more accurate. I am still learning but I feel it was a worthwhile investment. I can write my e-mail much faster now. I highly recommend it and I feel it was worth the cost.
2,XP users be aware....,I bought this product thinking it would be a great help with writing instructional materials. Unfortunately the first screen that appeared upon installation was a warning pop-up that the product has known bugs with the version of XP I have.Now I have to track down the fix before I can even start the software for the first time.That is no bueno!!!!!!
4,It really does work!,"Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 has been a godsend for my dysgraphic son. While it does make mistakes (some are funny, some frustrating), it can be trained to recognize the difference between what was said and its original interpretation, so it gets better over time. We marvel when it gets difficult words and sentences right. My son likes that all of it can be done with minimal use of the mouse and keyboard. It has really freed him to write what he wanted so badly to write but couldn't."
2,Naturally speaking 9 WeLLLLLLLLLL???????,"Maybe I havent taken enough time with the program, but I am not really impressed. It seems that it takes so much time to correct little mistakes and the software makes quite a few. For dictating a letter, its good, but for dictating out of your head the program lacks a bit. Like I said, maybe I need more time with It, but with the way its operating right now It's hard to use it, and just easier to type."
3,dragonspeak,"I'M SURE DRAGON SPEAK WORKS FINE, BUT IT GOT LOST IN THE MAIL...SO, I HAVEN'T USED IT YET"
1,Horrible! Don't buy!,"I ignored the reviews, figuring it would work fine for me. Big mistake! It takes a lot longer to write correctly using this thing than to type by hand, because it makes mistakes with almost every word you say. Now it doesn't work at all anymore. I only used it successfully a few times, and both times I gave up after a couple hours because it took so long and was so bad at recognizing the things I was saying s l o w l y. It is a waste of your money. Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Doesn't work well on laptop in noisy environment,"I used earlier versions of Dragon Naturally speaking and was satisfied with the results on a desktop machine with a name-brand sound card (for a third-party product I was developing for hire). I had hoped by now that this newer version would work well on a laptop in a noisy environment for my own personal use.I was so disappointed at how slowly DNS 9 worked and how poor the accuracy was that I haven't tried it since (and yes, I did train it on two different selections). Granted, a noisy environment and a laptop sound card are not the optimal environment for speech recognition, but let's be realistic--if I'm going to sit at a desktop machine, I'm going to be typing. Even though I've worked a lot with Dragon Naturally Speaking, I've rarely seen it work better than I can type."
2,"No, I am not dictating this review!","I did the training. I did a lot of training. This thing turns itself off whenever it feels like it. The ""Help"" feature is the worst ever. Sometimes the dictation, -- iof I can get it to work at all - comes out pretty good, but sometimes complete and utter gibberish appears. Solmetimes it gets the last part of a sentence only. I hate this crappy software!!!"
5,What a great product,"I am so impressed with the dragon software. Right out of the box, after a short time of going thru some examples I was able to use your product. I have had two throat operations and my voice is very deep and hoarse. Not an easy task to recognize my voice. Thank you for making such a wonderful product. I can write my book alot quicker now, The bonus is being able to dictate replies to my e-mail friends. It does not get any easier then this."
5,Excellent school aid,"I bought this for my 14 year old grandson. He uses it to do reports for school and thinks it is really cool. Instead of proofreading his work for spelling errors, this program does it for him. He has a tendency to mumble and the program won't work unless you speak clearly, so this was an unexpected plus and will hopefully carry over into everyday speech. Finally, because he enjoys using it, his reports are more detailed and thorough. He truly likes speaking ""Dragon""."
2,Poor,"I've had generally poor experience with it. It's slow, doesn't recognize a lot of my words, despite my having it mine my email files and Word files to ""learn"" which words I use. It helps a little but needs time as I'm constantly correctly it. I'm surprised others have been so satisfied."
1,Unnaturally Speaking,I did not even use it and sent it back--I wanted to put it on a PC that does not have an internet connection and you cannot do that. Not to mention that the packaging was pathetic and may have incurred some shipping damage (I did not even open it).
4,Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard,"I'm a disabled Vet & my sister is a Quad, BOTH of us have trouble keying a PC. This approach, which was invented by Dr. Kurzwell & refined by Nuance, is very, very servicible & should help the so-called able-bodied & we Disabled speed up asks."
3,Needs Training,"I bought the ""Standard"" version twice from Amazon and both times could not load the program because it had an ""Invalid"" product key. I finally went to Fry's and purchased the ""Preferred"" version. What I find is that the program does not recognize a significant number of words and commands, even though I did a lot of ""training"" and speak clearly. It could be that my microphone and/or sound care is deficient, but I find myself having to ""train"" the program to recognize many words and commands. Once it's trained it's okay, but one must be prepaed to have a lot of patience with this program. Other than that, the program is okay and very useful."
4,quick to start using,"I have been using this software for couple of weeks now, and I only use it occasionally. I have found that it is very easy to set up and start using and seems to recognize most all words. The software is far superior to other voice recognition software that I've used in the past. If you're not used to dictating it does take some getting used to. This software works best when you speak in sentences rather than word by word. I think after using this software for a little longer it will recognize all the words that I say. And I will be used to working with it to. I am using it right now to dictate this review directly into the Amazon website. I found it will work everywhere that you can type into a page. The only reason I am giving this product. Four stars instead of five is because the earphone piece on the mic headset. I find very uncomfortable and I have not found a comfortable way to use it."
3,Good but takes lots of work,"I was anxious to use this product and got it loaded right away.However, it takes quite some time to ""train"" the program to understandyour speaking style. I'm still working with it. It is superior tothe older products. I find I must speak more slowly than normal. I wouldrecommend if you have time to work with the product for 8-10 hours totrain it. I just haven't found all that time yet."
3,Dragon Naturally Speaking 9,"The program itself is okay but I think the headset needs to be improved. I speak well enough into it and the voice recognition does not work well. However, when I used a different headset it was better. If you buy this you may also want to look into a good headset with a good microphone."
2,Good Product Lousy Company,I had Dragon's Naturally 7 and I thought it was a pretty good product. When I got a new computer I upgraded to 9 - and what a mess its been. I'm going to do a bad thing and write a review before I've even used the product. I accept that it will basically do what its supposed to do - its getting it to start that is the problem. The program is activated but the microphone will not turn on - so the product is useless at the moment.Their support system is atrocious; since I bought it several months ago I'm out of my 'free call' period. Not only will it cost me $20 to talk to someone about it it'll cost me $10 just to e-mail. There's absolutely nothing on their FAQ's about the program being unwilling to even turn on. An attempt to join their community forum failed.My take; Nuance is just another tech company that doesn't a hoot about customer support; if I had another choice I'd be with them in second.
1,I want nobody to be cheated from this seller,"I bought standard edition from this seller.When it is delivered, the box was already opened, and the seal for the first CD was also broken.At first, I thought that somebody returned this, and this seller try to sell this again without sealing it.But, when I tried to install it, I found that something is wrong because CD-KEY was invalid.I realized that I was cheated when I take out the CD from my CD-ROM.The first CD was prefered edition whereas the second CD was standard edition.Of course anything else including CD-KEY is standard edition. I cannot even try to use it.I don't care if this is a mistake of seller.I am totally disappointed I am on the returning progress, now."
3,Puzzled,"Since Amazon recommends buying both the Standard and the Preferred Speech versions together, I am puzzled as to why. Do people buy both the Standard and the Preferred Speech version in order to make one version work? Is there a reason that people would install both versions on there computer? If the Standard version does so well, then why buy the Preferred Speech version? Is the extra money for the Preferred Speech worth it?I've noticed in the Preferred Speech review, many of the reviewers refer to the Preferred Speech version as ""Dragon NaturallySpeaking."" This to me adds to the confusion of what is being reviewed and blurs the line between the two products."
3,"I had planned to buy it, but...","Working on a Master's degree, I wanted to increase my productivity studying and less time typing, but it seems that writing the papers could be realistically more productive than talking to the computer.There seemed to be more negative comments than positive, and while some people may be technologically challenged, I'd rather save the money, and rely on good old-fashioned methods.As the old adage goes, ""anything worth doing, is worth doing yourself""."
4,"Yeah, it works ...","I am writing this review with the dictation software. I am a pastor, and the copy at my office does a reasonable job of handling theological argument via e-mail, after only about three weeks of training. The copy at home, from which I am writing this, suffers from a slower machine and less ability to isolate noises in the house.I still have a lot to learn about the software, and, apparently, quite a bit to learn about diction. :-) Still I recommend this software, but at the same time you order it I recommend that you also order a better microphone than what comes in the box."
4,Great Application,"I purchased Dragon Naturally Speaking for my wife a few weeks ago, and so far, she is thrilled with it! It is very user friendly, in walking you through setup and voice training."
1,Bugs galore,"PRO: When it works, it's fast and accurate, way better than the version 4 I was using. It is a great product, if it were stable.CON: Horribly unstable. Couldn't get it to work to type this review (I will be happy when I reinstall 4!). Tech support is an insult with a pay per incident system for a program this unstable (I suspect some problems lie in the activation scheme employed - I tried to activate manually at their website and their server spit errors, a very bad sign). I support PC's for a living and cannot recommend this potentially worthwhile product.Avoid this version, find an older one on the used market. Pray Nuance can save this product from extinction."
1,Surprise! It does NOT work as advertised!,"After researching the minimum system requirements for this product - Pentium 4 @ 1 Ghz >>OR EQUILIVANT<< I bought a laptop computer at a local retailer that has a Pentium M @ 1.7 Ghz processor speed.Naturally speaking 9 Standard arrived today from Amazon, and I immediately attempted to install the program.Oops! Processor doesn't have enough oomph for the program. Son works for Intel - he says that Pentium M IS a Pentium 4 that runs on lower voltage to minimize heat generation and prolong battery life. Same-o same-o processor otherwise - at least that's what I am told.Dunno for sure as I am not an Intel engineer - but I'd place my bet on the folks at Intel instead of Nuance.I now have a $100 program that refuses to install on my laptop. Beware that you do not get caught in the same trap."
5,The Who By Numbers,I was so excited to get The Who Limited Edition Vinyl Album. The cover drawing is awesome and was created and signed by John Entwistle. It arrived quickly and was packaged well.
3,My Fave!,"Great introspective stuff.""They are all in Love""is a simple forgotten classic.The reason for 3instead of 5 stars.WHY IS THIS REMIXED?All of the subtleties that I was looking forward to are gone.A clean up would have been better than a total wash."
4,"Townshend back to basics, but no longer a teen","This is a more down-to-earth collection of songs for The Who, in view of their recent ambitious projects, and a fine album. Pete Townshend is more focused on mid-life than teenage glory, and uses sparsity instead of embellishment in doing so in a collection of consistently good songs. The acoustic (OK, Banjo), jaunty ""Squeeze Box"" is a highlight, along with the opener, ""Slip Kid."" In this latter song and others, such as the pretty ""Imagine a Man,"" ""How Many Friends Have I Really Got,"" and ""However Much I Booze,"" Townshend looks inward (well, perhaps at other band members too). ""They Are All in Love"" seems to be an underrated gem.Not just synthesizers, but electric guitar, are less prominent as the acoustic sound and straight keyboards flow in their place. ""Who by Numbers"" is more low-key for this dynamic group, but still a fine album. Note also that the good lyrics play their part in maintaining quality. For another side of The Who, get this one."
5,"Quadrophenia, part two","Frankly, I am baffled as to the lukewarm reviews this album received. To me, this album represents the tail end of The Who's creative peak, which occured with the release of Quadrophenia, and it is the album's appropriate lack of ambition is all that prevents it from overtaking it's predecessor as The Who's best work. Each member of the band contributes their best performances ever, Townshend's songwriting is at it's peak, and each song represents another facet of his amazing talent. Daltrey sings with more fire than ever in the past, particulary on songs like ""Dreaming From The Waist"", and ""How Many Friends"".I am unable to go through the higlights of the album. Every song is a unique, powerful triumph all it's own."
4,"So this is where ""Slip Kid"" came from?","Wow! I have been listening to these guys, casually I might add, for quite a while. Other than ""Who's Next"" I thought their work was mediocre at best. Although musically ""Tommy"" and ""Quadriphina"" were good, if you didn't listen to the whole album than the individual songs wouldn't stand alone. That is the nature of that whole ""Rock Opera"" thing. You either get it or you don't. I never did. Story's were meant for novels not music. Anyway, ""Numbers"" is the Anti- Who so to speak in that every song is strong based on their own individual merits rather than relying on the sum of the whole."
4,Nice job by the Who,"Not a great album but one that is pleasing to listen to nonetheless.Has big hit ""Squeeze Box"" on it."
1,1 Good song = 1 star,Squeeze Box is a great classic song by The Who but the rest of this album is boring filler and I don't care to listen to a second time.
3,Definitely not the best Who album.,"If you started, as I did, listening to The Who with ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"" or with their 60's hits, this record will dissapoint you a little. It lacks for the most part the energy and insight that characterized the band at earlier stages.The only songs I would recommend are ""Slip kid"", ""Dreaming from the waist"", ""Success story"", and ""In a hand or a face""; maybe ""Squeeze box""."
1,I'd rather have a root canal than listen to this crap again!,"I love The Who. They are one of the best bands ever. But you would never know it from this record. I don't know what went wrong. The songs are plain stupid! I listened to this record twice trying to like but I had to abandon that effort because my ears couldn't stand the pain. The only half decent song on here is ""how many friends"". The rest of the album is garbage. I don't really know how else to describe this record except its trash. You would never know it though from the reviews on this website. Owing to this you may not believe me. So if you are seriously considering buying this record, please listen to it first, otherwise you are going to paying for one overly expensive beer coaster."
4,"Junea, Alaska, 1979","I wanted to give this a 5 star rating but it would have been for sentimental reasons. I heard San Francisco Medicine Ball playing at the Red Dog Saloon in Juneau, Alaska in the summer of '79. I was on shore leave off a tall ship studying whales in the northwest.They were a blast to listen to live and I bought this very LP while I was there. I still have it. I've always enjoyed it. I am thrilled to find a CD version. Very cool."
5,A Must For the Modern Feminist,"For any woman trying to reconcile the conflicting differences between ambition, family, self-reliance and love, this book is a MUST. Filled with interviews of real women who tackle real challenges, this book is easy to read in digestible chapters. It will force you to change your perceptions and transform your life! Debra Sands Miller is a wonderfully insightful writer with a big heart!"
1,Very Ordinary... Not Recommended...,"When one can buy hundreds of great CDs of REAL Manouche Gipsis playing REAL French-made Gipsi guitars, why buy an American copy of the style & the repertoire & the instrument ??? there is nothing new on this CD that hasn't been played & recorded MUCH MORE Beautifully by Romane or Stochelo Rosenberg or Jimmy Rosenberg or Angelo Debarre, etc, etc, etc... & ZERO original material...i would recommend spending your hard-earned cash on the ""real deal"" & support the true Gipsi musicians who play ""Djangos' Music"" on superior-sounding traditional Gipsi guitars with much more Intensity & Beauty & Authenticity !!!"
5,Excellent read!,"The first had account of the Eastern Front is detailed and complete from the perspective of the author. Details of the operations with the infrantry troops explain many of the tactics and out comes from the engagements. The one area the book is lacking detail with concerns the engagements with Allied forces in the Ruhr pocket. The author is severly injured, recovers and then gains a combat assignment with :Hunting Tigers"" on the Western Front. I would have enjoyed to read more on the ""Hunting Tiger"" and it real capabilities as the author fully detailed with his Tiger tank on the Eastern Front. Overall, a great book to read!"
3,Tigers in Mud,"Was an interesting read, a little heavy on personal political views on the way the German soldier was slighted after the war. Not once was there any mention of wrongdoing by any German soldier or the validity of the war. I got the point of the hardships the front line soldiers endured, but the constant references to post Germany not appreciating their sacrifices were somewhat distracting. Definately had a lot of interesting insight on tank tactics and supply problems. It opened my eyes that Tigers were fairly vulnarable if not used correctly. The author vividly describes his methods of preparation and execution in battle. This allows the reader to understand the need for good leadership and the consequences when leadership is lacking. Overall I found the book insightful and would recommend to anyone who is interested in learning about a weapon that carries a certain respect in WWII history. T.Parfitt"
3,memoir of fighting in Eastern Europe,this is a very personal view of a number of areas of battle. It gives fairly detailed accounts of tactics and mild criticisms of the Tiger Tank. Some of his political biases detract from the book. Otherwise fair comment.
4,WWII Panzer and German Army.,Excellent story of the German Army and the Panzer's role it played on the Eastern Front. Acurate and tells a good story of the trials the soliders faced against the Russian Army and their offensive..
4,Confessions of a real hero,Otto Carius is an amazing guy.Reading his book felt like an old friend was talking to me.I am impressed how humble is in his wrtiting and how correct he is on his rare political analysis on those days.I gave the book 4 stars because I think its not for everyone.Otto you are my friend from now on and I hope we meet in heaven.Christos
4,outnumbered and outgunned on the Eastern Front,"A good book but most reveiwers have said that. What is amazing about the book is that the Auther is still alive and kicking. There is a picture of him with his head just sticking out of the commanders hatch of a tiger tank, When the British tank museum restored their Tiger to running order, They invited the auther over and he was photographed in exactly the same position in the hatch, 60 years later."
3,Poorly translated,This first hand account of a German tank officers combat in Russia during WWII. It has been translated into English which makes the reading sometimes rough and clunky. It is a pretty good account of non-stop combat. The biggest problem is that it doesn't dive deep enough into the authors feelings. Kind of sterile.
2,Tigers in the Mud,A reasonable read although I think a lot's been lost in the translation. It does however provide a good insight into what it must have been like driving a Tiger during the war.Panzer Commander by Hans Von Luck is a much much better read.
3,"I love Selena Gomez, but not this movie.","I bought this dvd for my younger sister who loves selena gomez. we watched it together and I was extremely disappointed. However, she did really like it. So if you're buying this for a girl under the age of 11 who already loves Selena Gomez, then you're probably okay.it was just really cheesy and predictable and not funny when it was trying to be."
5,Good Movie,This is a good movie. It is fun for the whole family. selena gomez rocked the role and her and drews music is really catchy. my neice just sings a long Loved It
1,No,That's coming from a Cinderella fanatic.This movie was too long and too showy.I couldn't believe the scene where the pop-star fell on the main character and was just lying on top of her for an extended period of time.I bored quickly of the music video-scenes throughout the movie...and I found myself rooting for the background characters too often.
1,this movie = epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie seriously does stink selena gomez cant sing or act if her life depended on it this movie proves selena gomez is one big epic fail this movie itself is one big epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Best Movie,This was the best movie. We had to watch in over and over again! I'm going to be purchasing it on DVD.
5,Girly girl flick,This movie is a favorite of my 10 year old - we've been watching it for quite some time renting each time! This seller provided a great new movie with no issues for us to watch over and over and over and over again!!
5,Love it!!!,"One of my favorite movies! And my daughter loves it. I should buy it, can watch this over and over! Can you make this one and the first one a combo pack to purchase at a great price?"
3,Nothing Surprising,"I'm not sure how many different ways Cinderella can be told, so, that said, it's a cute enough story. I've always liked Selena Gomez and this movie enabled her to show off her acting and singing skills."
2,Not for me,"Not even sure why I decided to give this movie a shot, maybe I wanted to see one more story of cinderella being butchered by Disney and teenagers. I am not sure what I was expecting but this came even lower than my expectations. This is like cinderella meets step up, with dancing (I actually liked once of the dance scenes and that is why I am giving it a 2 stars)Overall a pretty bad movie."
2,Wish it was better...,"Our daughter loves Selena Gomez of Wizards of Waverly Place and the Ramona & Beezus movie. So we got this DVD thinking she would love it. She did sort of like it, but it's really not that good. Jane Lynch is the evil stepmother and she chews the scenery right on character. And Selena Gomez gives a lovely performance, as always. But it was somewhat slow and not really funny enough to balance the mean-spiritedness of the Stepmon and sisters."
3,Cute movie for young girls!,"I bought this movie for my little sister and found that I actually like it too! It's really cute and Jane Lynch is amazingly funny, but she always is. The acting wasn't terrible and Selena Gomez and Drew Seeley are adorable. The music all though not my taste was actually really catchy. There were some things I felt that could have been changed but all in all it was a pretty decent flick."
5,"great movie, amazing price",This is such a cute movie - entertaining for kids & parents and I found it on Amazon for an amazing price!
5,Another Cinderella Story,I bet most every girl will be able to relate to this one! Excellent movie. I have watched it several times-- Love the happy ending!
3,A somewhat watchable movie targeted at pre-teens.,"If you are an adult that likes the occasional young adult fare, veer away from this one. It is defintely for pre-teens. Jane Lynch stops by to play an aging pop star and the cruel guardian of Selena Gomez. Selena is just too cute. I was looking for something light and fun to watch, and this passed the time alright, but it wasn't really interesting or anything."
3,Another Cinderella Story,"It was okay. I think I have enjoyed other ""Cinderella"" type stories better. I did enjoy the dancing and the music. I think teenagers will love it esp. if they are a fan of Selena Gomez."
2,Target 12 to 14 yrs girls,"I can't believed I watched the whole movie. I can imagine that in the future someone will do a dark remake of this fable, something on the order of Sparticus.This is a family film for girls who want their first kiss to be the one that seals a lifetime of fidelity.A pityfull peice of movie makeing, made for girls who's parents will be shocked that their girls will prefure biker boys and piercings over giong to church on sunday."
2,"I just couldn't find any sympathy for this ""Cinderella...""","I love Selena Gomez. I really do. She couldn't be more adorable, she's multi-talented, and she usually steals the show in every scene she's in. But this movie is just so unsuspenseful, I couldn't even dredge up an ounce of sympathy for her character. I couldn't feel any chemistry between her and her leading man, either. Nada. The only clever part of the movie was when she danced with him undetected behind the 1-way mirror. Otherwise, my entire family was simply...bored. Ah, well. We remain huge Selena fans, however, and will continue to enjoy her talent in Wizards of Waverly Place."
1,Disney Crap for the already brainwashed Hanna-Montanna clone,"The worst teen movie I have ever watched. Badly written, horrendous acting and typical plot. Is this all that kids wanna be? Famous, sining and dancing? Watch something better unless you are into the fake world of make-believe cinderella stories."
4,exactly what I needed,This kit is excactly as described. easy to install and works great. had my motor sitting there unused. this kit made me a new pump for me. works great!
5,Excellent,I love this product and when used as directed and consistently it makes my hair beautiful. The friz in my curls is nonexsistent.
5,Love it!!!,I love this product on both wet and dry hair. It moisturizes my hair without drying chemicals. I like this alot. I will definately order this again.
2,Wow. HUGE disappointment.,"I have been a BIG fan of EUREKA since the beginning, and I am so very sad to see it all come to an end. That being said, I can't believe the writers left so many GAPING HOLES UNFILLED. I completely understand that they weren't given that much time to tie up loose ends, but come on. I'm hoping, REALLY hoping, that there will be a two-hour movie on SyFy that gives the show some REAL closure and FINALITY. Very disappointing. :("
4,Just the episode I was looking for!,This episode was just the episode I was looking for! Seems my cable provider's online service lacks a complete listing of ALL back episodes so I could catch up on my favorite show so I purchased a copy here.
5,Eureka fan,Season five meant the end of Eureka on television and the town and the characters will be missed. Thank goodness I have the entire series on DVDs. I look forward to watching the episodes and reliving the charm and chaos in this quaint little town.
4,Eureka's 3 Killers,"What killed Eureka? The writer's strike caused one seasons episodes to be divided over two seasons. Many people lost interest. I was creating a DVD collection and felt cheated by paying full price for half a season. As others have mentioned, the networks are supporting the trashier and cheaper programs. Saved the Universe or Jumped the Shark phenomenon is killer cause that has not been discussed, but is a large factor for me. That is when a series of books, movies or TV shows builds from simple plots or stories to Saving the Universe. You can only save the Universe once or do something so unbelievable like jumping the shark, that you loose your audience. Eureka was a victim of all three and couldn't survive.Eureka: Season Five"
5,sorry to see it end,"hello,sad as it is, this is the last season for eureka. there seemed to be an endless supply of story lines for future shows, but for some reason, not so intelligent ""reality tv"" shows are shoving these quality run programs off the air. sy-fy did a backwards decision in cancelling this quality program. the characters were outstanding and even will wheaton's character began to show some redeeming characteristics. the story line was outstanding and it is too bad that is the last of the ""best show on tv."" maybe a series of Eureka movies will continue to show up now and then... fans are still around, similar to the ""firefly"" series..."
4,Family favorite,"Funny, witty, interesting, etc. Actign is not the best and some of the writing could've been better, however we were sorry to see this series come to an end."
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!,"A great heartwarming Sci-Fi whimsical drama-comedy. Very character driven. You'll fall in love with everyone, even the 'bad guys'. Must watch for any Sci-Fi fan!"
5,"Good bye, Eureka!","I was so disappointed when Eureka decided to wind down and end the series. It was entertaining, intruiging and humorous. I loved the characters....so glad there was a happy ending. Maybe there will be a spin-off of some kind? I hope so!"
3,Love that I can buy online and watch it to!,Not as good as others maybe bc I knew it was going to come to an end :-( so sad
5,Great show I can watch over and over.,Eureka is a great show. I can it watch over and over. The many twists of the plot help further develop the characters as well as hold your interest.
2,Quantum Leap on crack!,"This particular episode was yanking hard on the ridiculous. I sorta get what the writers were trying to do with this one, but come on! Jumping back and forth from body to body was seriously stretching it, big time! And that one scene where Allison is in Jack's body while talking to Jo made me wince. What DID make me laugh and was enjoyable to watch was when Zane was in Carter's body and kept commenting on how old and ""doughy"" he was. Best scene: Allison: ""Are you okay?"" Zane/Carter: ""No! Look at me! I'm hideous! I'm part scarecrow, part Andy Griffith!"" Hilarious. I'm sure Colin Ferguson and the rest of the cast had a blast mimicking each other."
2,Eureka: Season Five,"The show itself is great. However, the DVD was flawed. In the very last episode, there was a glitch, and I had to fast forward past it to see the rest. No amount of cleaning or anything would work, so on the last episode, I couldn't see about 5 minutes of it. This happened the very first time I viewed it -- the disc was defective."
3,end of shows,"be glad they knew they wanted to end the show, instead of a cancel. Canceled is when the show is still going and they can it without notice like they did with Stargate Universe, Journeyman, Flash Gordon, Jericho, Terra nova."
1,Too many plot twists,"Speaking for myself, the first 3 years of this show are the ones I am keeping in my library--I will be giving away season 4.5 and chucking 4.0. I wasn't happy with the end of 4.5 and its plot twist. I have been waiting 4 years for Alison and Jack to finally get their act together and for 4 years the writers have been getting them close and then yanking their coming together away. As far as I am concerned they have finally gone beyond my patience level--I no longer care what happens to them. I canceled my season pass to season 5 and I most definitely won't be purchasing a copy of it"
5,Best SciFy show ever,"NO!!!!! Tell me it isn' so! How could you cancel it????Quirky, intelligent, fun, different but somewhat believable, it had everything.Not like the show on now that are just way over the top or ....gasp.... reality based, ugh.I vote to bring back Eureka!"
5,It is worth getting,"This is the final season of the show. Although I will miss seeing new episodes , at least I can go back and watch the old ones when ever I fell like it. It is definitely worth getting."
3,Eureka is one of my favorites but it faded at the end.,The early seasons where innovative and fresh an the beginning of the series. But is only so much you can do with the same stock characters with the same relationships and situations. I could care less if Zane and Lupo get together or not in whatever timeline.-I don't like soaps. And I am tired of the officious DOD jerks. I think the series has run its course by now.
4,One of the shows I missed,"We started watching this series and got hooked. I knew I was missing a connection between shows, so I came to Amazon to save my butt again, lol. It wasn't one of my favorite of the series, but it was good. Anyway, it completed my viewing of the entire season, tx Amazon video!"
5,Perhaps the best Eureka episode ever!,"Season 5, Episode 1: ""Lost""Interesting about the reviews already submitted. I can see why all the reviewers wrote what they wrote -- the liking and disliking of this episode is very much in the eye of the beholder/viewer.And as for me, I sat on the edge of my chair the whole time. Somebody wrote it was creepy (in a negative sense, I took it). I agree, but I see it as creepy in a very POSITIVE sense. Well acted, especially the Andys, and Allison.Whatever you expect, this episode goes beyond. I could have entitled this review as ""AI-Andy goes wild""."
4,Predictable fun,"Season five starts and continues like all the seasons before it. This is not heavy fare and I marvel at how persistently boring this show portrays life in a high tech industry. But it is fun to watch a series that offers little surprises, predictable episodes, and a penchant to solve every crisis with a high tech, MacGuyver-esque approach to a solution. All in all, every episode makes me smile and I decompress and relax for a bit. Go Buffy!!"
5,Miss,Eureka is one of the few TV shows that I actually liked and spent time watching. It is nothing really new but if you liked the last season you will like this. They end on a good note.
5,Best Syfy original,"Entertaining, creative, funny, and sometimes educational. My wife and I absolutely love this show. It's unfortunate that Syfy is cancelling it."
2,Bad,"Wow, I can't help it but this episode was really bad and I love the show. This went beyond ordinary levels of suspension of disbelief. It looked like the writers or producers, figuring they did not have answers to the many questions they have raised over the past seasons, decided to instead drown us in cheap plot twists and theatrics. They should call this the Halloween special. Neon Trees' videos make more sense."
3,Very creepy! But the show's running outta time.,"This was a good ep, but I'm sooooo very curious as to HOW the writers are gonna wrap up this series. There are so many plotholes and things that were intentionally(?) never explained. (i.e., Kevin no longer having Autism, his link to the artifact, exactly WHY he was in Section 5 that day Kim was killed, etc.,) I really don't want this show to end with so many unanswered questions. I understand that the writers weren't really given much time since the cancellation of Eureka came swiftly, but I am truly hoping for a 2 hour series finale on July 16th!"
5,please don't go,"i have watched this show since the beginning faithfully. i even record it so i don't miss it and can rewatch the show several times. i can not believe they are canceling this show. i guess if you are not a reality show you don't count. i am so sick of watching those kinds of shows and to have a show like this one with the great special effects, characters, the writers and stories. there are so few great or even half way watchable shows that i am dumbfounded. when i was a kid we had fewer channels but better shows because the networks weren't copying each other so much and they gave shows time to find their niche. now there are so many channels i can't even believe and still nothing new to watch, because if it works for one network the rest jump on board. new ideas, (bad), rehashed shows or copies (good) then people wonder why i watch reruns of MASH and Sex in the City as well as many others that are no longer with us."
4,eureka,"I now have the entire series of this program, now I dont have to wait for reruns to enjoy the perils and pitfalls of this fun town and all the characters involved"
4,eureka,Enjoyed immensely. There were a lot of special affects that kept ones attention. We wished there were more seasons. I heard it was cancelled abruptly due to finances. It is a shame. It was great because the whole family could watch it that included my 9 yr old daughter.
5,Loving it!,I absolutely am enjoying the video. Good quality images and the bonus features are very enjoyable. Watch it everyday since receiving it. Will order more in the future.
4,Eureka,"The story continues, but is showing its age. Does not have the same impact as earlier years. Still worth watching"
4,Great casting in this series,"I love this series, it's quirky and lite entertainment! Characters are easy to get attached to. It's clean language of which I appreciate greatly!! For most nights that I'm tired of dealing with real ""reality"", the last thing I want to watch is a reality TV show. This is a wonderful option with thought provoking plots into what could be and yet so light hearted and easy to watch. It's delightful!"
4,Fun and quirky sci-fi: sure ani't rocket science.,A sheriff of normal intelligence oversees town of research brains. Impossible research outcomes that cause havoc--always fun to watch. Try it out.
5,Eureka season five,"Great ending for a great series! We will miss this show! We watched the whole thing in about six weeks. Once we started season one we couldn't stop! If you are a Sci-Fi geek, you will like this series."
4,Great Show! Problems with playback,"The show deserves 5 stars, but there were problems with the playback on the first part of the episode and I had to restart it many times. Other than that - awesome!"
5,that darn ol' robert crumb...,"there he goes again, that crumb - putting his fancy artwork on the cover of a CD anthology of music he likes. danged if i'm not a sucker for buying every CD he's illustrated, and danged if every last one of them is a gem. i really can't complain - i've never been disappointed in any audio project he's been associated with. this one is a collection of 78 rpm recordings of female French accordian players from the 1930s and 40s - AMAZING stuff! exceptionally rare and out of print."
5,excellent purchase,this was a birthday gift for our sister. she put it together by herself and loves to show off her quilts.
1,Quilt rack is extremely disappointing,Terrible!!! Screws stripped with the first few turns and were impossible to insert. The rack can not be assembled with the hardware provided.
2,Backordered for over a month!,"I ordered this product for my husband on Dec 21, 2009, hoping to get it by Christmas. After I placed the order, the ship date displayed was Jan 5th. So, quite disappointing, but I figured he would understand, so I wrapped a printout of the item and told him it's on its way.Around mid January, I still hadn't received it and my husband actually reminded me about it, since I had mistakenly forgotten. I emailed the company and they told me it was on backorder until Jan 31st! Unbelievable! Were they even going to call or email me to let me know????So, finally we received the item and it was okay. Nothing special, but I guess for the price, we got what we paid for."
3,quilt rack,We have not received our product yet. So how can I give a review on it!!!! Please let us know when we should be receiving it.Thank You Brenda Schrier
2,Not worth it,"I ordered theWinsome Wood Quilt Rack, Walnutthrough the Amazon.com website. The packaging is impressive but what comes after leaves a lot to be desired.Four of the crossbars are for screwing-in but the holes drilled at the factory are too small. The other two crossbars are held by tension but they are millemeters short and do not stay put.I got out my husband's drill, made the holes bigger and used carpenter's glue to hold the tension crossbars. The screw caps supplied are too small for the holes. I had to glue them in.For the price and the remedial work I had to do, this item is not worth it."
2,unfinished product,"When I received this product, I was expecting an easy and straightforward assembly. In the package, there were no screws, no instructions, and some of the bars were curved; two needed to be glued and 8 needed to be screwed in. I went to my hardware store, and was told that the holes could not take screws because they were not threaded (indeed). And they were too large to take nails. So we had to thread them to fix 4 of the bars; and glue the last two. All together, it took time and energy, it added to costs, and I would not buy this again, even though the result is satisfactory."
1,Terrible!,"My husband and I ordered this for his mother as a Christmas gift. We received it a few days before, and on Christmas Eve tried to put it together so that we could put a bow on it and give it to her the following morning. Three of the holes to attach the rods through weren't drilled through all the way in the frame, and when we started to attach the rods to the top, the screw split the rod down the middle before it was even close to being tight. This is poorly made and a horrible disappointment as we won't have a gift for my MIL on Christmas. We'll be sending it back for sure!"
3,Ok for the price,"The quality is not as good as I'd hoped for, but I got what I paid for. I probably would not have purchased this item had I seen it first, but it looks fine when it's covered in quilts & blankets."
2,Not as winsome as it might be,"The ""Winsome Wood Quilt Rack"" comes at a good price, but the quality could be better. Mine arrived broken in two places, although the box came through just fine. It's a bit on the small side for displaying a quilt, although that's useful in tight spaces."
3,its okay,I am not very thrilled about this quilt rack. It is wobbly. The wood is very rough in some places. There was not enough stain on wood. My husband is going to restain it. I would not recommend.
2,Poorly made,Poorly made and poorly finished. Difficult to assymble since the screw holes are so much smaller than the screws. All in all your typical peice of Chinese junk.
2,Challenge to assemble and smaller than I anticipated.,"I have put together many different kinds of items, but this is the first one that needed serious adjustments before it could be assembled. The holes in the rods for the wood screws were not centered and were not long enough. Therefore the holes in the rods had to be re-drilled. As for size, if your quilts are bed size, rather than small wall hangings, only 2 quilts can be displayed and not drag the floor...cjs"
5,Very nice! I use it as a beautiful towel rack in the bathroom,I use this quilt rack in somewhat unconventional way. I use it as a beautiful towel rack in my bathroom. I like my towel to have a lot of room to dry. I am quilter and originally bought this rack for my quilts but then adapted this quilt rack to be a towel drying rack in the bathroom.It is much more attractive than any towel rack I have seen and looks beautiful in my bathroom. It is low profile (narrow in width) and does not take up a lot of room. It provides a lot of room for drying. Its finish stood up well to the damp towels and have not discolor after over 6 months of use.Ali Julia review
1,I don't even drink,"While I have written about spirits in ""the other world"" I have NEVER written this text. I don't know how my name was attached to the title but I must say if there are some checks waiting for me...I'll gladly accept them."
2,not what I expected,"I was rather disappointed with this ""moist"" heating pad. It claims that it gets the moisture out of the air, and since I live in a place with little to no humidity (the desert), don't know how that is even possible. It doesn't contain the usual foam pad that you would normally wet. Also the manual that came with it was written by somebody with little grasp of the English language so I'm still not sure how to program the thing properly. I do like the way the pad covers the shoulders, which is about the only good thing I can say about it."
2,Comes up short,"This item has all the right ideas. However, the front flaps are rather short and the appliance cord is connected in the back which can make it uncomfortable to use. Would recommend buying the theratherm instead."
5,Fascinating!,"I couldn't put it down! The stories of this great Jewish personality really come to life in this collection. Taken from various authentic documents, these tales are sure to enlighten and inspire readers of all ages. A book not to miss!"
3,Basic overview,"If you have no previous knowledge of voiceover you will get a good, very basic overview. If you have any previous knowledge there are several other books(much less expensive) that go more in depth. It seems to be overpriced for what I received.(even with the cassette tapes)"
2,Poorly photographed diagrams,Photographed diagrams do not clearly show folding sequence. Difficult to impossible to follow.Not recommended.
2,Poorly illustrated. Not very helpful.,"I bought this book to improve my crawl stroke and to learn butterfly. This book does not help me.The book, 8.5x11, 159 pages, has 18 chapters (""steps""). Just to give an example, the butterfly stroke occupies 4 chapters (the dolphin kick, the arm pull, the coordination, and the turn). In all these chapters there isn't a single series of complete illustration. All the figures only show this or that segment of the whole process.What's more, the drawings in the butterfly section don't even match the cover photo. The same poor quality illustration is all over the book.If you need a book to tell you how to swim like a professional, I would recommend one with actual photos (instead of drawings) of both frontal and side view. ""Competitive Swimming"" (from Sports Illustrated) is a better book in this sense. If you are already a pro, the final chaptor ""whatermanship"" may interest you. It shows how do do a few fun water games, like, forming a multiperson centipede..."
5,"Good efficient program,improved my speed and stamina.","Good pictures, good directions, good systems of instructions. It corrected my bad habits. IT IS WORTH IT."
4,Very detailed on how you go about swimming!,It showed you the understanting of swimming.It motivated me to be an excellent swimmer.
5,I love Trisha,"I remember a Trisha interview that siad she wouldn't record a song if she couldn't feel good about singing it in front of Linda Rondstadt. i think that has made her a great recording star - because her music is never shallow or ""fad-like"". She knows how to belt out a ballad (Maybe It's Love) or have fun with it (Believe Me Baby, Everybody Knows). She never goes off the deep end nor does she leave you feeling like something's missing. All in all, excellent music that can be listened to over and over."
4,A cartoon introduction,"This is kind of a neat book, but not what I was looking for. It's a VERY basic comic book of sorts to give you a very general idea of anthropology terms and ideas. If you're looking for an anthro for dummies type thing, this isn't it."
2,A Large Variety of Sound,"This CD features some well known Artists, such as ""Coldcut, Basement Jaxx and The Ballistic Brothers""...The sound spectrum ranges from Lounge to Electro over Jungle to Big Beat. It also features one very special and unique Track from ""East Of Suez"" called ""Marrakesh"".This CD can be recommended for Bars and Lounges or for cool summer Parties."
1,(a.k.a. A Little Death Music) Not good at all.,Forgettable characters and slow plot. Too many references to music vocabulary (it's part of the plot and you can't avoid it).
3,Musical Mystery,"Yes, this is a mystery for musicians to enjoy. I read it and gave it to two other friends who loved it. While the music of Mozart plays no part in the story whatsoever, all of the main charactors have cleverly been named after people in Mozart's life. See if you can figure it out!I also enjoyed the description of the live concert. Anyone who has been on a stage trying to perform live will empathize with these musicians."
5,The Best Dog Story Ever,"This is a book about a boy and his dog. They are trying to catch some monkeys. It is difficult for him because the monkeys are too smart for him. He tries to catch them many different ways. The monkeys out smart every time. His grandpa tries to help him but it's no use. This books genre is adventure. The author puts a boy, his dog, and his grandpa in two of his stories. The and his dog go down in the river bottoms and try to catch some monkeys. They try with a net, some traps, and they try to be friends, but fail them all. One night they had a bad thunder storm. The next day the boy and his dog found the monkeys all sick and wet. They got a bunch of money for catching the monkeys. You should read this book if you like adventurous funny stories. So sometime when you're board read this book."
4,Emily's amazing book of Summer of the Monkey's,The Summer of the Monkey's was a very interesting book.It was about a young boy named Jay Berry Lee and he goes to the bottomsand finds something unusual.One day he went down there to get his cow cause she ran away and he went to get her and he seen monkeys.Not long after that he bought his self a horse his sister wanted to ride it but there mom was to scared let her go for a ride her leg had been hurt ever since she was born and she was needing surgery.After Jay Berry bought his horse he had some money left over and he deciced to give it to his sister to let her have surgery.At the beginning of the storythey was riding on a train and the train crashed and the monkeys ran away and Jay Berry caught themand then he had the Circus Director came to there house to get them that's about it.
5,the book thats right for you,"It's the late 1800's and fourteen year old JayBerry Lee is stirring up aload of trouble when he finds out that thirty monkeys have escaped from the circus in the bottom of the Oklahoma Ozarks.The circus is giving two dollars for every monkey he catches and one-hundred dollars for the big monkey,Jimbo.JayBerry figures out that there is no monkey business when it comes to catching monkeys.I'm not going to lie it took forever to read this book on the account of it was boring at the beginning.And then when I finally got passed the beginning I couldn't put it down.Willson Rawls tells the story very slow but it has a great message."
3,Should be aimed at younger readers,"Summer of the Monkeys may be historical fiction, but the dialogue is pretty modern and bland. More accurate dialogue would have added charm and humor. Also, the boy compares fireflies to ""a million flashlights."" The flashlight had not been invented. A quibble, yes, but come on. It takes you out of the story. I thought the challenge of the monkeys was funny, but everything else predictable. The denouement was beyond sappy, beyond belief, and way too saccharine. And the closing paragraph seemed tacked on and rushed. The book, I think, would be best enjoyed by 4th or 5th graders. The writing and plotting is just too simplistic for middle schoolers."
2,Summer of the monkeys,this book was very funney and it shows that if you put your mind to something you can catch 28 monkeys and Jimbo. wilson Rawls is a very descriptive writer and you can tell he took a lot of time to make this book. Although i think the monkeys shouldn't have been so smart. i give this a two star rating because it didn't really keep our interest. But i am not saying not to read this book because the last part gets very emotinal-Three fifth grade boys
3,summer the monkeys,"this book is funny, adventurous, and makes you want to read on as Jay gets out smarted by the monkeys. it tells you that if you put your mind to something you can catch 28 monkeys and Jimbo. wilson Rawls is a very descriptive writer and is very funny too. is give this book a good 3 stars. i think that they should come out with an edited version of the book with pictures. i reccommend this book to any one who likes comedy"
4,Monkey Trouble in Oklahoma,"Ever since Jay Berry, the main character has been old enough to appreciate it; he has wanted a pony and .22. Now, he finds out that some monkeys have escaped from a circus train in the Oklahoma Ozarks, right where he lives! He is determined to catch them, because now is his chance for a pony and .22. But, he has his little sister's crippled leg to think of once he gets his money.Over the summer, Jay finds out that monkeys aren't very easy to catch especially trained monkeys. One night, there is a terrible storm. Jay is worried about the monkeys. If Jay Berry catches the monkeys, what will he use the money for? I recommend this book for kids and adults."
4,Summer of the Monkeys,"Summer of the MonkeysThis book was suggested by another teacher. She said her students loved it and wanted her to keep reading each day. It is a good read for students, full of descriptive language, similes, and helps them to see a time before handheld games, the Internet, and other devices we use daily."
5,"""ADVENTURE BOUND""","The Summer of the Monkeys was a fascinating book. It left me wondering what else could've happened. Jay a talented boy sets out to do anything his heart desires. With the relationship he has with his grandfather, miracles are achieved. Great book."
5,a touching adventure that shows the true value of family,"Summer of the Monkeys tells the story of Jay Berry, a 14 year old boy from Arkansas. The book covers his adventures one summer with a group of monkeys. Set in the late 1800's in the heart of the Oklahoma Cherokee country, Wilson Rawls tells this coming of age story in which we can all relate. Rawls skill as a master story teller, which is evident in his other impressive work, Where the Red Fern Grows,comes through with characters for whom we relate. It is a tale of hope and sacrifice that we call learn from."
5,Great!!!!!,Summer of the Monkeys was a great book. I think it was the best book I ever had read. Wilson Rawls wrote the book in a wonderful way that caught my attention. I would highly recommend this book along with Where the Red Fern Grows also by Wilson Rawls.
5,"Exciting, fantastic, outrageous!",I liked this book alot. It was funny. I think children 8 and up should read it. This is the best book I have read and kids will love it. There are many laughs and some cries in this book. You will like it!
5,The Very Best!,"Prepare to laugh until you cry! This poignant tale of a boy and his grandfather trying to catch monkeys in the Ozark Hills is absolutely the very best! My only disappointment is that Wilson Rawls, also author of Where the Red Fern Grows, does not write more of these wonderful, inspiring,love-filled tales!"
5,No Words to Explain how wonderful and EXCITING!!!!!!,"A four-teen year old boy, Jay Berry, and his sidekick, a Blue-Tick Hound, Rowdy, are in lots of monkey trouble from the beggining! It all started when Jay Berry and Rowdy are down in the bottems of the Ozarks searching for thier old cow, when Jay Berry is scared out of his wits by a loud scream, almost like a cat. This is only the first encounter that Jay Berry, and Rowdy will have with the hundred-dollar monkey. What will happen next with Jay Berry Lee, and Rowdy? Why are there Monkeys in the Ozark bottems? Monkeys? is that what the sound really was? Read it and you will find a enjoyable book for the whole family!! Wilson Rawls takes you through a time of laghter, confusion, happiness, saddness, and Love the strong bond that kept the Family together."
4,Maggie's Monkey Review,"This book is more fun than playing with a tree of monkeys! Jay Berry lived near Tahlequah, OK, with his Papa, Mama, and little crippled sister. He was down in the bottoms when he heard a weird sound. He sprinted all the way home; he was so scared! Later that day Mama asked him to go to his Grandpa's store and get some groceries. At his Grandpa's store his Grandpa told him, ""You probably heard the cries of escaped monkeys."" Grandpa informed him, ""There is a prize for catching those monkeys."" 28 of the monkeys were worth 2 dollars each, and the 29th monkey was worth 100 dollars. Jay Berry had always wanted a pony and .22. If he captured all those monkeys he could probably buy both and still have more money left over. The 100 dollar monkey outsmarted him. Jay Berry didn't catch a single monkey the first try. Will he ever catch the monkeys and get his pony and .22? I recommend Summer of the Monkeys, because it's exciting and suspenseful."
5,a wonderful book for young and old alike.,My daughter read this book while in the fourth grade. She enjoyed it so much that she said I had to read it to. She was right. this book is a great read for all ages.
1,don't read this book it is boring,"I thought this was the most boringest book i had ever read in 5th and im in 8th grade and i still hate it. I thought it didn't make much sense at all about catching monkeys. It wasn't very intresting at all. I'm also complaining about the print ""it was so SMALL that you had to use a magnify glass to even try to see the words"""
1,This is the worst book I've ever read.,"I would not recommend this book Summer of the Monkeys toanyone. It is not that great. I kept on losing interest in it. Itisn't that good. I think it's too long and too hard. The boy and hisdog are trying to catch the monkeys and keep failing to catchthem. They use old slang like ""my dog and me."" It's a horriblebook. END"
1,That's Not a Monkey!,"Out of all the people involved in this work, you'd think it would have dawned on at least ONE of them that these are CHIMPANZEES, not monkeys. Monkeys are as different from chimps as dogs are from cats. Did no one attached to this project take a high school science class? And this work is geared toward children, no less! Amazing! No wonder we can't convince the other half of the country to accept Evolution...they don't even know the difference between a chimp and a monkey!"
2,Sucked basickly,So i had to read it but i didint cuz i couldny stand SUMMER OF THE HOS anyyy way no dont buy
2,Total Letdown,"As a parent of an 11 year old horse-lover, I would advise you skip this one and save your money.My daughter loves horses. I mean, LOVES them. I figured she would love a PS2 game called ""Horsez"" too, but we were both sorely disappointed.There are parts of this game that are fun for her, but most of it is poorly designed AND poorly executed. Some of my daughter's quotes:""Man, I wish I could see better.""""I wish I could look around""""Where is the key, dad?""""Why isn't there a map?""""How do I find ____?""""How do I do ____?""You get the idea. There are NO maps, no waypoints, no camera controls, and very little help in completing missions. I'm 34 years old, and I am apparently not smart enough to figure this game out, either.The controls are poor, the in-game acting is poor, and graphics are on the poor side of okay. In short, save your money and wait until game developers figure out that little girls play PS2, too, and they deserve the best -- just like their brothers."
1,Big money cheat. Do not buy!,"Game stinks and lies. Okay, on the back, it has a picture of a foal that you get to take of and train and watch grow, right? Wrong, this never happens. If you've ever played Champion Dreams, and played this, you'll see what I mean. Its exactly -no difference- the same game. But it tries to tell you its a different game on the box. I bought this game, and was so disappointed that my mom called the place where I got it and asked if I could return it and told them why. Thankfully, I got to return it.Oh, and just to tell you how much horse knowledge Ubi Soft has, on the back of the box on the computer version of this game, the have a picture of a foal wearing a western saddle. And the saddle is backwards! Ubi should not make horse games, because they stink at it. And there doing this stuff with other games too. Dreamer and My Pony Club are the same!"
4,Help!!!!!!!!,"I need help! I can't find the key to the libary ANYWHERE! If someone could help me, I'd be SO HAPPY! Please just put up a review telling me how to find that darn key! I really want to get farther in the adventure mode, but I'm stuck on that one level! PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,E-rotic can do better than this!,"I like their music but this song is extremely boring! If you like E-rotic, buy their other CD's, they are all cool but this one is a waist of money!"
3,"Amusing, but kind of treads the line.","Rene Goscinny, Asterix in Spain (Orion, 1969)If Asterix has to go help the Britons, he has to go help the Spaniards. It's like a rule. The feisty son of the sole village in Spain holding out against Roman rule (of course) is kidnapped by the legionnaires and spirited off to (where else?) Gaul, where he gets loose and runs into Asterix and Obelix, who promise to deliver him to his village. Hilarity ensues.Most are likely to see Goscinny's portrayals of Spaniards here as the same type of gentle fun-poking as one can find in, say, Asterix in Britain, but for those of you with sensitive skin, be warned that some folks may find them offensive. Otherwise, another fine adventure from Asterix and co. ***"
5,Ole! Ave!,"""Asterix in Spain"" is the fourteenth comic in the Asterix series, first published in 1969. There's a lot of adventure, great locations, and lots of wordplays that have been cleverly translated into English from the original French.Caesar has taken over Spain, yet a small town holds out against the invaders. To bring them to surrender, Caesar kidnaps the chiefs son, and sends him away to Gaul. Asterix, Obelix and Dogmatix find the boy while he's playing hide and seek with the Roman legionairies. They take him to their village, but he proves to be a bit of a nuisance, holding his breath when he doesn't get something he wants, stirring up fights and giggling at Obelix. They decide to take him home to Spain, across the mountains, and past many dangers. Will things be put right?It's a really clever little comic."
4,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,A funny and charming book in which Asterix must help Pepe get home to his father in Spain. A funny adventure that will you laughing
2,Not as expected,"This Binocular is useful between 10-15x but after that the image quality will come done too much, also it has shaded exit pupil due to improper prism material, which in turns will decrease light coming inside, and since the coating is only fully the brightness will not be maximized, and after 20x hardly you can enjoy the image. Comparing with skymaster 10x-70 , I recommend the skymaster one which is lower in price higher in quality and it has multicoated lenses, and no shaded exit pupil, but not zoomed one ."
3,just okay,"I'm no expert, first time owner, just not that happy, shakes too much when held. Maybe they all do it. The mount for the stand broke very easily, would not buy again."
3,Eh... It's Okay.,"Initially, I was completely thrilled to have this in my hands. I work in desktop publishing, and the way it was marketed to me, I thought Digital Juice would be the end of my ""I need this in a pinch"" design frustrations... particularly with PowerPoint Presentations.Now that I have it, I find that the majority of the designs included are useless. They are improperly laid out on the screen, and most of the colors and designs they give you are absolutely absurd. It would be painful to have to look at some of these up on a big screen slide after slide.Since purchasing the Digital Juice set about a year and a half ago, I have used it two or three times. It you're into outlandish designs, it's probably perfect for you, but if you're looking for something more sophisticated and tailored, I'd avoid making the purchase."
3,no information,"Have no idea re: book contents. I build wooden/plastic models and need detailed drawings for engine parts, particularly frame construction and how wheels and springs are attached."
4,Weavers CD,"The music was as splendid and joyful as ever.The CD, however, is garbled in the first song. Very disappointing."
1,Not intended for an investigator,"Before basic there is "" Investiagting Computer Crime"". If you have an knowledge of investigations or computers, this book is not for you. Other than a brief section in outdated programs the book offers no assistance....sorry. Not even a maybe book for investigators."
2,Good for histroy and basic computer forensic methods,A fair basic book for an overview of general computer forensic methods for the uninitiated. Not a book for the experienced computer forensic examiner. Content is very outdated.
2,"Extremely outdated, good for laughs though!","This book was published in 1996, however, the information seems like it comes from 1986. It is full of stereotypes and hacker rumors that any REAL hacker would laugh at. It might be good if you want the info on search warrants, but computer hardware and software has changed so much that most of this book is irrelevant today."
5,Seek This Out.,"This book uses seven of Alvar Aalto's most notable buildings to illustrate his working methods, his skills and his theories. When I picked it up I was a bit worried: How do you sum up fifty years of steady practice in seven buildings? Well, I got my answer. This is not a summary. Rather than a page or two on the hundreds of buildings & projects Aalto did, this book is an in depth study of a few major works. The essays are wonerful, the photos & sketches are great. A fine look at one of the true masters of the craft."
4,Another Good Series to buy............,The first series of Pure Trance rocked as well as this one.................They always seem to put out good music.............
5,Most shirt for your money :),"This is an outstanding piece of clothing that looks and feels like a $60-80 shirt for about the price of a T-Shirt. I've gotten several compliments wearing it.The shirt itself is quality fabric with a nice texture. The 55% cotton/45% polyester blend looks slick, feels comfortable on the skin, and is somewhat wrinkle resistant. It's very versatile, especially if you get it in some of the more conservative colors.The only real shortcoming I can find is that you have to be careful how you wash it...but even that's easy so long as you only put it in with similar colors and use the ""delicate"" setting on your washer/drier.Overall an excellent deal, and this seller shipped it very quickly to me."
3,"not great,but ok","shirt wasnt really what i expected,it was shipped in a box about the size of a deck of cards."
1,You get what you pay for,"The shirt was VERY short; I normally wear a large and it was WAY too short. Even my wife laughed at me when I asked her opinion. The fabric was so-so. Definitely would not recommend this shirt, or the Port Authority brand."
4,Really Nice,"Having been fooled by other shirts I've ordered online I was a bit timid about ordering this one. Some shirts while being described as a certain material, cling to the body like plastic wrap. Only wearable in the winter. Most shirts come undersized and you have to order one size up. This shirt was perfect in size and material. It feels and wears just like a 100 percent cotton shirt, which was what I've been looking for all along. If you order this shirt order it in your exact size and it will fit nicely. Very happy with it, thanks."
3,Nice Color,"The Shirt was a very nice two tone color,plus it fit very well and I will use it during bowling games.I also like the simple style not to flashy."
2,Expensive shirt and attracts lint...,"This stylish shirt is simple and nice.But I have purchased higher quality shirts for the same price if not cheaper.I'm not sure if its meant to be imbroidered and the cost reflects that service. I dint get it with additional stitching, though...It also attracts lint. Which I hate!"
2,mens shirt,"I purchased the shirt for my son, the response time was really good but the shirt was not quite what I expected. Nice but not exactly what I had in mind."
5,"The book is GREAT, and CDs DO hold 650 mb Mr. Portland, OR!","Basically what I said in the line above. The book is great, and if you have ever read anything on cd storage, or even looked at a recordable cd case, then you know a cd hold 650MB of data."
4,Not to be taken seriously,"If you want to read a book that you can enjoy, then this is it. it has humour, action, and conspiracy theories. The basic story line is a little far fetched. ""War Heaven"" is a 50/50 mix between Tom Clancy and Douglas Adams. I read this book while serving in Germany and I left it with my father when I was on leave. Now the book is lost and out of print. I really miss my copy of ""War Heaven"". I can only hope that it comes back into print."
1,Good book for manual systems,I was shocked when I read this book. I am an accounts payable supervisor and this was recommended in an accounting newletter I receive. The book is written for a company using a manual accounting system (there are pictures of columnar pads). We are on an integrated accounting software so this book so not apply at all. I am in the process of sending the book back.
1,Not helpful at all,Only had one to two pages on broad topics such as Accounts Receivable. I purchased this book and sent it back.
2,BAD....very bad,"Ok the graphics on this game look like something from the nintendo 64 system.... really really really bad. Find and enemy up ahead??? Great, just shoot ANYPLACE in the general area and you will kill him. If you want feel free to just walk up to them, they wount shoot at you (they just stand around.) I found the way you interact with the game to be the only ""cool"" feature. The game is so easy and boring to look at, I lost interest and went back to WII sports instead.Buy the pc version of this game instead. Not only does it have nice graphics, but it plays like a GAME with a story you care about beating."
2,"Awful, awful game. A disgrace to the Wii","First of all, let me say that this is an awful game. I'll say that straight out. The story is boring, the settings are repetitive, and the controls are absolutely god awful. The reason I gave it two stars is that the premise is OK: if the execution was good, the controls might work. But, alas, the execution is not good. Whenever you want to turn you have to aim the Wiimote off screen, it moves very slowly, and you'll find yourself doing this when you want to aim. Worse, the Wiimote is too precise, and thus, shaky, to aim well with their set up- your target shifts everywhere. Also, the whole game is very repetitive: kill bad guys, run around, find the secret entrance, etc. Even the Wii's uniqueness failed to make this game a shred of fun to play."
4,Reviewers Got this WRONG!!!,"I admit that when I first fired up this game, I was disappointed! But since this was a rental I continued to play. I was more disappointed when it seemed to be nothing more than an ugly Xbox version. I am wrong. There are similarities but this is NOT the same game. The graphics are bad when compared to the PC or Xbox versions but they SERIOUSLY will not bother you after play for a while. I'm having more fun with the Wii version than the others because I enjoy the Wii mote controls and the ability to run and gun more. Granted, It's only because the AI of the Wii version is not as intelligent as the others but the others required a more tedious slower pace to beat the game. I play my games on Hard difficulty. The only problem I have with this version is that it at times drops in the frame rate."
5,It does'nt have good graphics but its certainly not a bad game.,"Far cry vengeance the game has awful graphics but Its a Wii Game! is it supposed to have Good graphics!?! it definitely it makes up for it in gameplay the motion controls are good, nice Environments, the guns are fun and its just a fun game although its not a perfect game it has its flaws such as the vehicles controls feel slightly awkward the cutscenes have horrible graphics and cheesy voice acting no online multiplayer but these flaws are minor when playing. most of its bad reputation comes from being released when the wii was and people where expecting outstanding graphics like the Xbox 360 and people where disappointed with there first impressions of the game you really have to get past the first level for it to be good. if what your looking for is a game with good graphics don't play it! (i can't stress this enough if you don't go in with a bias its one of the most fun Wii games you'll play) and its definitely worth the price."
2,Good controls ruined by horrible graphics,"Amazingly enough, this game has really good controls. Whilenot perfect, the aiming is quite intuitive. But the overall game is ruined by the horrible graphics. I normally do not place much emphasis on graphics, but for this game they are so bad that they affect the actual game. You have trouble seeing enemies at a distance because they are so blurry. When you have a bunch of enemies running at you the graphics engine slows down so much that they look like they are running in a slow choppy like motion. The sound is also awful. Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a game that was not finished. I will certainly think twice before buying another one of their games. That said, had they put a few more months into this game they could have had a really good FPS. Stupid decison on their part."
5,Excellent Game,Excellent Action Game.The WII controls makes it almost perfect. Since it is in WII the graphics are no excellent but they are not bad at all.I really like this game. It is hard to put it down after you start playing.
2,Ouch!,"I wasn't expecting anything specatular when I bought this game, but jeez did they screw up a potentially good game. The graphics are just unbearable, even for the Wii. The controls aren't very solid. Laughably bad AI. You would think they could see you from ten feet away? The pros are few and far between. 1. You get to use a gun 2. Multiplayer isn't terrible. 3. It was only $20. I am very tolerable of bad games, but please don't buy this game!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,"To anyone considering the purchase of Far Cry: Vengeance be warned: IT IS HORRIBLE! I bought it used for $7 bucks and it was the biggest waste of money that I have EVER experienced with ANY game or accessory PERIOD. Check out the past reviews rating this as a 1 star and take them all to heart. This game is a true turkey in all respects. Graphics, game play, sound, etc. were all bottom of the barrel and UBI Soft should hide their heads in shame for releasing such garbage. If creating pig excrement on CD was a category at the game awards, then UBI should get a gold medal! As I type this the wretched game sits collecting dust until I remember to turn it in to GameStop for a few bucks credit. Either that or be a humanitarian and break it so that nobody else falls prey to the financial waste that I experienced..."
2,Incredibly disappointing,"I had high hopes for this game, but once played the whole thing comes crubling down. the wii-controls are sloppy, the graphics were worse than a DS and the fun level is minimal to none-sold the game 15 hours after i bought it"
5,Would buy again,"Purchased for Christmas gifts...love to ""unplug"" the kids on occasion and this item can do just that. A great travel game also."
5,You will not regret this purchase!!,This game was purchased for our 11 yr. old grandson and he loves it!! He spends hrs. playing this game. He has requested we find him the other fun varieties they sell.
4,Great Birthday present,Great Birthday present both for girls and boys. They can sit for hours and find the various items. You can also make it to a race and see you is going to find the items first. I have a 6 and a 9 year old and they both love to play with it. It is also a great toy for kids when they have to wait for longer period of time like the airport or at the Doctor's office
4,Gift for Brother,"For Christmas, we gave the zoo version to my brother-in-law's family. My kids got me the sports version, my daughter the Wizard of Oz version, and my brother the original version.This made for a fun on Christmas afternoon as we'd pass them around and take turns looking for all the hidden objects. Hours of fun. Easy to use. Well built."
4,A good busy toy,"We love the Find It game. The girls play it in restaurants, doctor's offices, and in the car. The only problem ... two girls and one game. #2 is on it's way."
1,Yuck!,"Don't waste your time!! It was given to me but I won't bother passing it on to any one else. Matching a 15/16 year old with a 29 year old bothered me. Harry's trickery bothered me. It all bothered me. I didn't even bother with the last 10 pages. I was that close to the end, got interrupted and thought ""So what?"" I am not yet convinced that Jane Feather is worth trying again."
2,Not exactly one of her best,"I was disappointed with the maturity level of Henrietta. Granted she was 16, but she was a spoiled little girl from the beginning to the end. The moral of the story shouldn't be ""it's alright to do things for people as long as you believe it's right."" Henrietta demonstrated a distinct selffishness that disappointed me in the end."
2,Not as good as I had expected,I was disappointed at the way the author had failed to develop the heroine to her full potential. I felt the hero to be too unyielding and the age differences between the two to be too vast. I was left feeling disatisfied and felt as if the story was not yet complete. It also seems as if the hero did not fully appreciate her differences and spent too much time trying to change her. It is not til the end that I felt he had let go of his first deceased paragon of a wife and finally fully embraces his new wife. It was not one of the best books I've read thus far this year.
2,Weak Clips,The hangers are inexpensive but the clips are very weak. My pants keep slipping out with the slightest bump.
3,If you've been to Japan...,"If you have been to Japan, then this book is not for you. There really isnt that much in it! Yes, there is nice art and some witty comments, but most of the book is a waste of space. There are two whole pages that have one picture of an inch long fish. Instead of this book, i would HIGHLY recommend Betty Reynolds ""Clueless in Tokyo"", ""Still Clueless in Tokyo"", and ""Squeamish about Sushi""."
2,Nice pictures but lacks substance,"This book was not what I expected. It is a picture book with some basic stories. It lacks depth and excitement. The book is mainly a collection of watercolors and basic observations of Japan. The observations / text are typically 1 page each and look like copies of her handwritten journal. For someone who is going to Japan and has never been to Japan or likes Japanese art this might be a good gift. For someone who has been to Japan and knows about Japanese culture this book is not that interesting unless you are looking for a very basic intro to Japan and some Japanese art in one book. The book did offer a creative style and nice pictures, but it was simply too light and lacking for me. For a far better story and much book on Japan overall checkout Karin Muller, ""A Year in Search of Wa""."
2,Poor!,"Don't spend your money on this book. I was through within 30 minutes. It's a bunch of drawn pictures with a few sentences to each picture. I don't quite know what to say to this book, but it's really not a book. It's more like a well-meant children's diary with drawn illustrations (sometimes 1 small branch over 2 pages and nothing more). There is SOOOOOO much wasted space and paper! There is no subsence to this book whatsoever and very few and poor explanations. I think the author would have been better off taking beautiful pictures of Japan, which speak for themselves, instead of these child-like drawings that bring you anything but close to Japan. I hate to be so mean, but the book really isn't even worth $5. I just don't understand the purpuse of so much wasted space and paper. It's almost like she didn't know how to fill all those pages...."
1,An adult picture book,"The positive reviews for this book must have been written by the author's friends. I was tricked into buying it by the hype and it turned up at the top of my Amazon search. There are some occasionally charming water colors but almost no text. The text that is present is adolescent, trivial and always mundane. This is not a book for anyone about to go to Japan or who has any interest in the subject. Absolutely no meat. Lots of watercolors of socks and wash clothes without any commentary other than ""I have never seen so may beautiful socks or so many stores devoted entirely to them. This advanced sock culture can be attibuted in part to the custom of removing one's shoes upon entering a home."" This is 6 pages of the book and there is no further commentary _ WHY DO WE REMOVE OUR SHOES??! Do not bother with this silly and overpriced book. THis book came up on my search ""Japanese History"" _ BUYER BEWARE"
5,"Fruit, Zen, and Socks.","A book full of fun and humor by Kate T. Willamson is just the thing I needed to relax this past week. With colorful images and interesting observations she brings a small piece of Japan for the readers to enjoy. Socks, blossoms, food and people are all subjects of interest to the author as she traveled about Japan for a year. Just have to wonder about her footwear fetish."
5,Great!,"When I found out I was having another baby, I knew it was time for my older (about 2ish) son to give up his crib! Hes 2 1/2 now and LOVES this bed!It was easy to put toghether, me and my husband did it in about 45 minutes (take in consideration I was a cranky, pregnant, wife!) and my son was estatic!The bed is beautiful and withstands jumping, rolling, kicking, and of course, sleeping! The rails prevent him from rolling out, and they are nice and safe! His bed looks great with Elmo sheets and he has never been happier!It took our average sized crib matress and its easy to get in and out of...We absolutley love this bed, and my son, who was attatched to his crib, loves it too!"
5,A Great Toddler Bed!,"We bought this bed a few months ago for our (part monkey) 18 month-old daughter, and we just LOVE it! This is the second toddler bed we've bought (the first for our son), and it is without a doubt the better of the two. It is well constructed, sturdy, very attractive and easy to assemble. It's a great toddler bed. Which is exactly what our daughter thought as well, since she insisted on sleeping in it--and ONLY it--since about five seconds after setting it up!"
4,What a big girl bed!!!,"We got this bed for our just-turned-two-year-old after she climbed out of her crib for the first time and broke her arm on the way down! This bed was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. My husband was able to put this bed together fairly easily, and our daughter even ""helped"". My only complaint is that the side rails aren't long enough. This isn't a complaint about this product,however, as all toddler beds are the same as far as the rail is concerned. Overall, I would strongly reccommend this product. Our daughter loves it and has adjusted fairly well to the change in beds!"
4,"cute bed, ""ok"" quality","Just got this for my 2 year old. The bed looks very nice and is made well with a few exceptions. The problem I had was that the slats that hold the mattress were warped making it difficult to put together. Also ours has a dirty handprint stain on the headboard that appears to have happened before it was varnished at the factory, so we can't remove it. I'm still debating if I'm going to try and exchange it because of that reason alone. It took quite a bit of time to assemble, so I'm hesitant. Anyways, I like the bed for the most part. It seems pretty sturdy, more so than the plasic ones I've looked at."
3,girls did a nice job..wheres nsync!?,I'm a huge fan and this is a nice idea for a party but the pics and info is nothing new to a true fan. Very boring watching girls giggle at stuff you already know. Stick with 'N THE MIX. Stay 'N Sync!
1,DONT BUY!!,This video totally sucks if i could i would give it 0 stars!! All it is is watching gurls scream adn laugh over nsync...and all of the trivia questions something that every nsync fan already knows...im telling you right now dont buy any nsync videos unless they are offcial!
1,HORRIBLE VIDEO ONLY FEATURING GIRLS WHO GIGGLE,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THERE IS NO FOOTAGE OF THE GUYS AND IT IS SO BORING TO WATCH. THE ENTIRE THING IS A VIDEO OF A BUNCH OF YOUNG GIRLS IN SOMEONE'S HOUSE THROWING AN ""NSYNC PARTY"" WHICH CONSISTS OF THEM GIGGLING ABOUT NSYNC, TALKING ABOUT WHY THEY LIKE THE GUYS AND QUIZZING EACHOTHER ON FACTS. DO NOT BUY THIS...BUT YOU SHOULD GET 'N THE MIX!!"
3,An okay video,"This video was pretty good but (sorry if I sound picky) the quality of the graphics and the voice of the person really stunk. The whole video takes you step by step how to have an *N Sync party. And they ask questions about *N Sync (That I am very proud to say I knew all the answers of) There is one really annyoing girl at the party that really bothers me but who cares! They don't play ANY of *N Sync's music which really stinks! They show some really cute clips of the guys talking which is cute but over all I kinda wish I hadn't bought it. But I love collecting *N Sync stuff so... (I wrote a poem for you) If you like collecting *N Sync stuff too, I'd get this if I were you! Arent I such a talented poet! Hee hee, see ya later!"
2,N SYNC PARTY,I have to tell everyone that Im the biggest N Sync fan but this movie bit the big one. I thought that Nsync would be in it but they really wern't. That really made me mad. So if I were you don't buy it because its not what you think it is going to be. Trust ME! I Will Always LOVE LANCE FOEVER! STAY N SYNC
1,people haveing a party on nsync,ok like every one is saying this was a really bad movie i love nsync and i thought they would be on it but they werent witch really kinda made me mad. OH EVERY I JUST WHANT TO SAY THAT JUSTIN IS MINE LOL
2,Please don't buy!,"Hey! I bought this video because it had *NSYNC on it, so I thought *NSYNC would be in it. . . Yup, they were in it- for about 2 minutes! That's it! The rest was some stupid girls talking about them! And trust me, those girls were annoying!:) Instead of this, I would buy *N The Mix cuz that video is the best! -Casey Keep It *NSYNC!"
2,Not Good Enough,"I saw it and automatically tought i was gonna get something like ""'n the mix"". but no. it was not that good. i wished it had more of the guys than of those fans.they gave out good bios and interested info but NSYNC deserves to have the fans do a much better video. i gave this one 2 stars because i would have been bored if the guys were not there and they wouldn't have spoken some beautiful words."
1,What Were They Thinking????,"Ok, I am like the biggest N'Sync freak out there, and when I bought this video I thought that it would be N'Sync havin a party with their sexy selves, but yet again it was some stupid girls, having a party about N'Sync. Now N' in the mix was awesome!! Justin Timberlake iz mine ladies thanks!!"
3,Bad choice of the title,"The title of the book should be: ""Analyzing social changes through repeated surveys"", because the document doesn't explain how to manage problems associated with repeated surveys; instead, it concentrates in problems associated to identify social changes using, as statistical instrument, repeated surveys."
5,art appreciation for the young,if only they had a book like this one 28 years ago when my own children could enjoy and understand art in such a clever way. on every page vincent van goat appears with a bandaged ear and a short beard. the selections of art are excellent and the facing page leads children to discussion about the work. i would like to see more books like this one.
1,Current book NOT current with paper money information,"Though there are several errors in this 2004 edition, the most outstanding and noticeable item is what's NOT included. There is absolutely no listing for any bills past 1995 issues! If the newer, larger portrait bills intrigued you enough to start collecting -- you'll find nothing about them. Whether you're a beginning collector or been at it a while, this book is a must SKIP. Two days after I bought it and made some initial notations in it, I tossed it into the trash. If I could give ""0"" stars or a negative, I would. Before you buy any guide or reference book, look through it to be sure it has what you're looking for!"
2,Too many errors as to organization of contents: confusing!,"Although, it is complete it is not very organized and the page numbers do correspond with the contents. If you are used to Friedberg's catalog of US Currency or some of the old Donlon catalogs you will not like this. Really needed to be proof read before printing. Had I known this I would not have purchased it!"
4,God Bless Norman Mailer,"After all these years some humble pie. Some of this is yet still too sour for our friends in Haters Review Row. Too bad. Norman Mailer is one of the greatest writers of our time, whether you like him or not. If you don't like him, don't waste your time ""reviewing"" his work, just go away and leave us alone, we don't need any more of your whining. This book gave me a lot of little laughs, and some ""modest gifts"" of insightful and not-so-great ""poems"" or ""prose-snippets"", whatever you would like to call them. It was a fun release from the more arduous ""Of a Fire On the Moon"" which I am currently reading. I just finished The Prisoner of Sex, written by Mailer in 1970-- quite an interesting take on the ""Women's Lib"" movement at that time-- a bit heady, but with other equipment as well (!) God Bless Norman Mailer, one of the last great American authors."
5,"A ""Living"" Book","This book is about a poor family in New York. It is what Charlotte Mason referred to as a ""living"" book. When I read this book to my children, they were 6 and 7 years of age. They were spellbound and I wound up reading it in one sitting because they ""begged"" me to keep going! There is also a neat craft idea for making a Christmas star.Joan Sewell"
3,Love the music,"Music is great and the acting with Jackson and Davis are a perfect pair.Exciting, but a little to violent for kids to watch"
3,The Christmas Songs is actually...,"Hate to nickpict but the christmas song in the beginning of the movie is NOT ""Blue Christmas"". It is actually ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town"" by Elvis Pressley."
4,Missing X-mas song,"The X-mas song is called ""Blue Christmas"". I am not sure who did the version on the movie, but a very close rendition is done by Brian Setzer on his ""Boogie Woogie Christmas"" CD"
2,Not Up To Current Standards,CD was OK. Music was below quality of that in original soundtrack. Contained some of the songs from the movie but they were not performed by the original artists. Example: Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff was performed by the Tom Tom Club on this CD. A definite disappointment.
5,Quality,"This is a great disk. One I always take with me. Nice variety, all pretty laid back type of music. I originally bought it for the Zombies cover ""She's not there"". Many of the songs it contains are not actually in the movie. They are songs from which the director derived inspiration or that Samuel L Jackson hummed during the movie. Fortunately, that means they're on the disk because they are good music not just good background music for a film. Speaking as someone without much knowledge of the genre I enjoy the blues tracks which constitute a large portion of the disk but it also contains, hip hop, rock, and pop rock. A definite crowd-pleaser."
4,Missing song? Freed by Tracy Bonham,"The first song at the end rolling the credits is titled ""Free"" by Tracy Bonham according to the credits. But I don't think it's on the Soundtrack ?!?! I think the actually song by Tracy Bonham is ""Freed"" from her 2000 album entitled ""Down Here"". It sounds almost the same, although I think the song on the movie is maybe remixed, perhaps faster, harder, etc? I'm thinking about getting the DVD just to have that song at the end !!!"
3,missing too many songs,"Along with ""Not talking about the linen"" and ""Free"" by Tracy Bonham it's also missing the Xmas song too. ""It's Christmas time Pretty Baby"" It sounds like Elvis, but I'm not sure. But at least it has Lady Marmalade and Manish Boy. Maybe they needed a second CD."
5,to bad,"q,elle dommage que la serie ne revient pas la raison est que 3 cheveaux sons mort au cour de la production?????"
5,what u talkin bout bunk???????,"this album is tight. the track wit keak is one of my favorite songs of all time. federal is off the hook the one with fully loaded , murder zone,the one wit d moe ,yuk is on here.come on now. ap-9 is the $hiznit"
2,Bunk,This CD is garbage. There is a few decent songs. Militay mindstate is Ap9's only solo Cd worth buying.
1,not a clean cut pomade,"To remove product, lather olive oil and rinse, then get grease cutting dishwasher detergent (dawn) and lather, repeat the detergent step about 4 times, comb hair and do a final rinse with shampoo and conditioner. You're welcome in advance btw this took like 30 minutes.If you are looking for a pomade to get a nice clean cut look(I have thick straight hair that I part on the left side and comb to the right, Blonde) seriously look elsewhere. I heard Jon Hamm and Dicaprio wear this, that is complete and utter bull. This stuff will make your hair flat and spiky.Wonder what this stuff looks like? google image search Cameron Diaz in ""There's something about Mary"" and look for the swoop hair, seriously I'm not kidding you will not be able to run your fingers through your hair.It sticks to EVERYTHING."
5,A song for the 90's if ever there was one,"Don't know much about the other songs on the cd, but this remastered version of Enjoy Yourself (It's later than you think) is too funny. It's got great horns, a cha cha/latino sound and lyrics that will make you laugh out loud. If ever there was a warning song for fast paced career driven 90's people--this is it."
2,Not Enough for study,"This dictionary&Phrase book is, in my opinion, not enough for studying Uzbek seriously. And there're some spell mistakes even from Uzbek beginners' eyes like me. So as a dictionary, I only feel stress from this book.Just if you just want to travel broken Uzbek, it's OK."
4,good uzbek resource,"Good resource for learning Uzbek. A little limited, in terms of dictionary size, but there aren't many other resources to learn from. Useful phrase book."
3,Latin transliteration is confusing,"My biggest complaint about this phrasebook is how sounds are represented in Latin script. The ""OW"" sounds are spelled with v's. This may work better for Germanic-language speakers, but for English speakers it is a bit misleading. The ""ong"" sound is spelled ""eng"" also. These are just the few I caught from browsing the book; there may be more.Just be aware that sounds are spelled not exactly as they sound. You would need a tape or native speaker to compare the spelling with. I can use this book mostly because I have already studied Uzbek and know what to expect.I thought the content was quite useful."
4,Ms Weymouth is awesome and underrated,"I've always liked the Talking Heads, Ms Weymouth deserves more credit for the awesome popularity"
2,Talking Heads are dead,"The rhythm section is still there--and so are the backgroung tracks, but this album proves that what really made the Heads the Heads is David Byrne's tilted lyrics and vocals, flaoting up, down and around it all. With the substitution af a variety of singers, despite some great, funky tracks, this album marks the true end of a great pop/ rock/ funk etc. band."
2,Boring,Ya. it had a pretty naked chick in it. but man it was booooring. definitely one for a very specialised market
4,Great sump pump,"Good brand name ,solid performing pump. Easy install no hastle . Best buy I could find for a pump of this quality arrived within days of placing order"
2,wayne rpp50 pump,junk lasted two weeks after two hours to install worked for two weeks know wont shut off should have bought one from local store don't buy
3,kids liked it,"My 12 year old grandson liked the game well enough, so I gave it to him. He and his younger brothers enjoy playing it."
5,Loved it.,The kids love this game! Thank you very much for hours of entertainment for the whole family. Thanks again. Loved it!
4,silly fun!,"I got this as a Xmas present for my 5 year old son. He loves to play our WII and recently discovered monster trucks. I think he'll like this, he likes his other driving games."
3,Good,"This cd is inspriational & good music, very traditional of Beverly Crawford. Good old fashion foot stomping praise & worship. I'm still standing one of my favorites."
4,Vicarious Time Travel,I enjoyed the book. It was riveting. Chester Himes lived a very rich and challenging life. I have come to believe that we are defined by our relationships. It is very clear to me that his relationships as an adult were definitely affected by his dysfunctional home. He was certainly a man of courage and action who took risks and suffered the consequences of failure and celebrated the fruits of success. His vivid descriptions of events and people made me feel as If I had travelled back in time and to each new faraway place that fate took him.
2,This Finest is below average,"They had two good songs and they are both on this album. However, the rest of the album is just there and it doesn't stand out and say listen to me because I'm good. This is worth buying if you are a huge fan of the group, but if not, just wait to find it used somewhere."
2,two cool tracks,"i will give them""She Drives Me Crazy"",&""Good Thing"", but after that it's a Poor Mans Simply Red on a so/so day.catchy production&playing but nothing that sticks to you.very forgettable after a couple of listens.you just know that someone will sample them &make them look better than they were.i hope not.two cool tracks is enough."
1,Why?,"I get so sick of bands that have one or two hits that release a greatest hits album! They have no business doing it and they should never make any money off of it. FYC only released TWO albums! If they want a greatest hits album, they should earn it. If I could I would give it zero stars, based solely on the group's audacity."
4,Roland Gift's voice is incredible!,"I am a 16 year-old who used to never bother to listen to 80's music, preferring instead to stick with my own generation's pop music. However, one song I remember from when I was 6 years old sticks out in my mind, and that song, was of course, ""She Drives Me Crazy"" by The Fine Young Cannibals. I even saw a satire done of it on the show In Living Color, if anyone remembers that show that starred comedians like Jim Carrey, Damon Wayans, David Allen Grier, etc. The song was great, and suddenly last year I found a copy of The Raw and The Cooked from 1989. I listen to that song a lot, and I think Roland Gift's voice is incredibly enchanting. Now FYC's music in general is up there with my own generation's pop music in my book, hands down! The Finest is just a great compilation of good music from these 3 talented Britons who deserve fame even today."
5,Totally Excellent!!!!,This is a great CD! It just works. My wife and I agree on almost nothing about music. She's big into classical & jazz. Give me rock & folk. We both love this CD. I am currently listening to our recently acquired copy at the office. A second is on order for home. Need I say more?
2,Disappointed!,"I decided to buy this item because the online manual said it can store credit cards etc. so that I could replace my wallet. I just got the item and there is no inside pocket except two tiny ones for storing SD cards. The bottom of the case is open so that there is no way to store credit cards unless you want to lose them... At the minimum, it is right size for iPAQ 4155, though."
3,Solid Case - Flawed Design,"I decided to buy this case because it was made by HP. You would figure who would know better than the manufacturer itself on how to make a case for it's own products. This case fits my IPAQ 1935 (1900 series) snugly and perfectly. It's very secure and I don't worry about the Ipaq ever falling out. It also leaves space open at tops to plug in earphones while the case is closed. The leather is sturdy and soft - looks very elegant and professional. However unless you are buying form over function, my biggest complaint is that I constantly have to remove the IPAQ from the case to use it. The trifold does not allow you to access the IPAQ while it is within the case, you have to take it out to use it which is annoying because what do you do with the case when you are holding the IPAQ?"
5,Best Import You Never Heard Of,"The best album TBS ever recorded (and unfortunately only comes as import). Pop-rock at it's best with great man-woman dialogues between Heaton and Abbot. 3 songs in the middle (from ""Pretties Eyes"" to ""Hooligans"") are worth buying this album for, but add straight-between-your-eyes ""Mini-correct"" along with soft ""Especially for you"" and you get a collection which anybody who likes good music shouldnt miss..."
4,A fun twist on trad,"As an Irish speaker and traditional musician, I found Na Casaidigh's rocked-up take on these very familiar traditional songs to be fun and refreshing. The treatment works better for some songs than others, and I must admit, despite my initial startled reaction, I really like best the ones that they've tinkered with heavily, such as ""Óró, Sé do Bheatha Abhaile"" and ""Port Láirge"" (and ""An bhFaca Tú Mo Shéamaisín"" makes me guffaw every time I hear it! If I were Séamaisín, I'd sneak off to school too, with this kind of doting mamaí hanging over me!). If you're looking for a very straight, pure drop traditional performance, this isn't the CD for you (and it definitely won't appeal to airy fairy new age types!), but if you like your trad mixed with a bit of creative rock and roll, and if you enjoy the idea of hearing native Irish speakers (with beautiful Donegal Irish!) put a new spin on songs they've sung since childhood, this is a must-have."
3,Okay,I love the boondocks and I have to say that this is the weakest season in terms of funny. I still like the wittiness though.
4,Worth the money,Great series. Love it. I never get a chance to watch it on regular tv. So the DVD is more convenient.
5,Love this show,"If you've never seen the show start with season 1 this show is simply hilarious. The overall show has funny moments, but certain things just stay with you for so long"
5,"IMO, still just as good...","Before I bought this I had already seen most of the episodes on AS. I must tell you, tho, the experience of seeing them on DVD is a MAJOR improvement in the enjoyment factor.Now, as far as some others that have said this season was not as funny as the previous two... I thought this one was just as good. I look at it like this...The first season was so hilarious AND it was a complete shock because it was unlike anything else currently available. The second season was just as good as the first, BUT not as shocking because we had experienced the first season.This one (the third season) is still really very good, but the shock value has worn off.So, I love it! If you LOVE The Boondocks, too, then I say get all three seasons (like I did).If you just like this show, check out Adult Swim. You'll catch an episode every now and again...just my $0.02."
5,Huey rules!!!,"This season is great, both disgustingly hilarious with a pile of political madness.It will offend, but it will not disappoint the hungry and ignorant masses. This show speaks greatly to the recently grown-up generation, the recently incarcerated, the recently paroled, and most of all it speaks to those criminally insane ""conspiracy theorists"". A testament to the hateocracy and stinkmeaners we all face everyday! why aren't there more shows pushing the envelope like this one? it is about time someone had the balls to do a show like this.Although this show is Not for the kiddies. The boondocks is also a syndicated comic, and many comic strips are available to view online."
4,Boodocks- Complete 3rd Season,"Huge Boondocks fan. As with the past two seasons, this DVD set is uncensored, and uncut. I'm only disappointed that there aren't more extra features (like in the Season 2 DVD set, which contained interviews with Aaron Mcgruder, and various cast members, and gag reels/ behind the scenes footage- which I love). All episodes on the Season 3 box set offer an option to play an introduction by Cedric Yarbrough (Tom Dubois, Stinkmeaner), and Gary Anthony Williams (Uncle Ruckus, no relations). The two have great chemistry together. Certainly must-have for any Boondocks fan."
5,If you can't appreciate satire and are easily offended...,"If you can't handle about ""us"" talking about ""us"" this isn't for you. The boondocks. Of course you have the episodes that you watch repeatedly, but I love all seasons and this was a good value! I understand people feeling the mockery of stereotypical or even patterned behavior of African Americans being degrading. This isn't meant to be degrading so if you can relax, loosen your glutes and enjoy the satire don't purchase it."
4,Great season!,This third season is too funny! I think all three seasons were great and I think that there should be a fourth.
5,I am the stone that the builder refused,"Boondocks baby, one of the greatest satires of all time.. If you like racism, and humor, and enjoy laughing at topics that are usually of topic, then this is the show for you."
2,black and white,"This book was a disappointment because the artwork is in black and white. I had inteneded to use it for art appreciation, but I am unable to do that because color cannot be evaluated in any way. Nice pieces were chosen. Too bad it cannot be enjoyed in color."
3,It's Pretty Good,This is good because it makes the screen bigger and has a light. It's good for night time play.
4,pretty good,its great for the night and when you wish you had a gba because of how big its screen is. the only down is its nearly impossibe to get off but youre not goin to be doing that very much are yah?
3,Don't trust the blurb on the back,"While story kept my attention, I must complain that the book is not much like the blurb on the back cover. The worm hole piece of the story only comes into play on page 200, 2/3 of the way through the book. Save for the last hundred pages, the book is otherwise a standard spy thriller adventure."
3,First half of a good book,"If this book was finished, I'd give it 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, it ends right in the middle of the story, with the majority of the plotlines left unfinished and hardly any loose ends tied. And that's a shame, because up until the last few pages it's a really good book that is hard to put down (other reviewers have done a good job reviewing the actual story, so I won't repeat them here). But the authors either ran out of time in the middle of their story and had to hand something over to the publisher or think it's OK for a story to depend on a sequel rather than building the foundation for one. My recommendation is to wait until the sequel is published then buy both books together so you have a complete story."
4,Avid Club Music Listener and Club Goer,"I found the CD to be Very Good. The following cuts provokes me to want to get out on the dance floor to dance, #2,#4,& Numbers 5-10. I found cuts #1&3 rather boring. Those cuts, the music doesn't make me want to move. If the music doesn't move me or provoke me to want to move, I won't listen to it. I am very passionate about music and I like to listen to music that touches my soul and make me want to move. Especially music I want to listen to when I go to the club and when I am at home. Despite those two cuts, I found that the CD was overall a very good buy. I would reccommend it to anyone."
2,Fell off after 2 days,"My daughter really like this Frog toy caddy and it keeps her toys off the floor of my shower preventing me breaking my neck from stepping on them. however it only lasted for 2 days before it feel off. she still likes to use the frog to scoop her toys from the water, but now have to get replacement adhesive strips. from other reviews I've read here looks like a trip to hardware store. had it stuck to wall I would have given it 5 stars... since it didn't i rate this a 2 star overall."
2,It fell off after 2 months,"When I bought this product I thought it was adorable. It is brightly colored and is a neat idea. However after about 2 months, maybe not even that, it just fell off my bathtub. One adhesive tape was still stuck to the product and the other was still stuck to my tub. I called Munchkin's customer service and she gave me two options. Either I would have to go to a hardware store and buy more adhesive tape at my expense to repair it. Or return the product at my expense and they would replace it. She said it was a new product this year and that she didn't know much about it. That is lousy if you ask me. Hope you have more luck with yours. Looking back I wish I had spent the extra money to get the Boon Frog Scoop."
2,THE ELECTRIC GUITARS HURT MY EARS,"A lot of the songs on this CD aren't bad. Its the arrangements that make them bad. The electric guitars are so loud and the background singers nearly drown Reba out on a lot of them. THe fast songs all sound alike even though I really like ""I'd Rather Ride Around With You"". There is one song that is really good and that one is called ""Close to Crazy"". But I also like the title track and wonder why it wasn't released as a single because its really good too. But you can have the rest of the songs. LIke I said, they aren't bad songs but I wonder what this would have sounded like if they had made it a ""real traditional country album"" with ""traditional"" arrangements. It could have been done and if it had, Reba would have had another winner here. Get rid of the electric guitars and the loud drums please!!!!"
5,"Spunky, Sassy, & Sexy!",That's Reba McEntire on this album! It's fresh and clear! A huge change from her albums of the early '90s! It's no wonder the first two tracks were #1 singles (The Fear of Being Alone & How Was I To Know) and the third (I'd Rather Ride Around With You) climbed to #2! All three have become Reba standards! Reba is like a FINE WINE! She gets better each year!
1,Not Worth One Penny!!,"This CD, like most of Reba McEntire's 90s music is just another example of stupid sounding Pop material. If you want to hear the real Reba McEntire, give her 80s material a listen. This one here is not worth the one cent its going for by the used sellers at Amazon!!"
1,WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH REBA??,"The stuff she put out during the 90s does NOT resemble country in any way shape or form. I don't know what's the matter with her but I do know that I find myself going back and listening to her Mercury products and her traditional country CDs from MCA and keep asking myself ""why, oh why did she do it""?"
1,SORRY REBA!!,"If this album is overlooked its only because none of the songs here are memorable. I did like ""I'd Rather Ride Around With You"" but its too reminiscent of teeny boppers joy riding. The ballads are not very memorable. THey don't stand out!! Everything is too loud. Does anyone even remember when Reba USED to be Country instead of POP?"
1,REBA IS NEARLY DROWNED OUT BY THE MUSIC,Reba says in the liner notes of this CD that she wanted this to be akin to a crisp mountain stream not an ocean. Well she got the ocean. The cover art is all beach stuff and the songs inside reflect that. Some of the songs aren't bad but they really aren't up to her standard. The pop oriented fans which are most of what Reba has these days will eat this up. Its obvious that she will never return to traditional country so I don't know why I continue to support her when she records middle of the road stuff like this. Her band played on here.....loudly I might add!!! Her voice is drowned out by the banging of the instruments done in a rock fashion that appeals to people and the background vocals...well....whatever happened to a thing called overdubbing and singing harmony with yourself?? More is not necessarily better!!
1,Reba is the best,I would just like to say that it is hard to pick one song that is the best But I do like What if its you.all rebas songs can put a smile on anyones face.rebas the best female singer there is.
2,I ACTUALLY LIKED SOME OF THE SONGS ON HERE,"This one is not good but its far from being Reba's worst. There are a few tunes on here that merit mentioning like ""What If Its You"" the title cut. I really like that. ""Just about Crazy"" is also good. So is ""State of Grace"". ""I'd Rather Ride Around with You"" is pop but its o.k. The rest of the CD...well....its Reba gone pop. What is there left to say?????"
3,Country Lovers Get Over It!,"Several reviewers have complained that Reba has gone Pop. Obviously these are people who don't listen to Pop music. However, I will say it is Pop flavored country at best.I was never a fan of Reba's until her show. That's when I started listening to some of her music. Still not a fan of her early ""country"" music. If you like Reba McEntire, but don't like the traditional country sound, give this one a listen.Reba has not left country music, but has broaden her appeal to a larger crowd. Just as not every Pop singer is strictly fluff and bubblegum, not every country singer has a million problems while standing by their man."
1,WORTH IT ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF SONGS BUT NO MORE,"Be forewarned now....this is not a country CD! Well, only ""Close to Crazy"" fits that bill. The rest are just fizzie pop...or more like flat pop songs that didn't quite make it. I did enjoy ""I'd Rather Ride Around with You"" but not enough to recommend this CD to anyone."
1,I HAVE TO LAUGH AT SOME OF THESE REVIEWS,"Some of these reviews are downright ridiculous. One thing they're right on, though, is the fact that this CD is absolutely ""not country"" but bubblegum pop. If that's what Reba wants to record that's fine but that's not what I want to hear so I guess I'll go buy some Patty Loveless instead. There is real country!!"
5,Excellent Buy,Great purchase. Portable and works as advertised. I travel a lot and the european plug is an added bonus.
2,Too delicate,"I got this hammer via a promotional trade-in. I used to be a framer so I do appreciate a well made hammer. The hammer felt very comfortable & the weight was nice. Unfortunately, the serrations on the head wore down in a little over a month, & the head became loose. The company replaced the hammer but this time sent along an instruction sheet that states the hammer cannot be used to strike chisels, nail sets, or nail pullers.As a remodeling contractor I need a hammer that is able to hit allot more than just soft nails so the replacement hammer is sitting in its box unused. I went back to conventional steel."
2,If you love the series.,"Maybe this is just not my game, but i loved the ""Sands of Time"". The PSP controls are just too... complicated. It also wasn't engaging or long enough."
2,Would be better if.....,Let me start by saying I love most Prince of Persia games and I would probably like this one to if it were for the camera! How am I supposed to play a game when the camera is facing backwards 1/2 the time? And I know I could re-center the camera but I never really had this problem with other PoP games (sands of time comes to mind).Having said all this I have loaned the game to a friend to doesn't mind the camera at all so maybe it's just me.L
2,Disappointed grandchild,My grandson really wanted this game. He was very excited about getting it and loaded it onto his PSP successfully. When he tried to play it it would not play.Thinking it was a defected game I returned it and got another one. Once again the same problem. If there is some secret to getting this to work it should beincluded in the instructions. We are currently waiting for a response to our email from the help department. Are they all defective in which case have a recall or is it just a poorly made product. Either way your child may be very disappointed and you are left making returns
4,great comprehensive book of the region,"We visited the Yucatan area for ~8 days and used this book extensively throughout our trip. This is an excellent guide if you like to do things different than the mainstream. Not surprisingly we got tired of Cancun itself very quickly, with it's Vegas-like atmosphere, crowds and prices. This book was the only reference we needed to visit the surrounding region and provided a great overview of the 'real' Yucatan.However, the coverage of hotels and restaurants is not comprehensive. The authors only describe the places that where they have actually eaten/stayed, with a lot of personal opinions rather than objective views. Also, they seem to be fixated on bakeries, which was kind of odd.Overall a great book, but I would suggest to get a complementary guide for the purpose of food/lodging."
5,Appears to be a great book.,I have ordered this book to learn the art of Watercolor quilts. This price was too good to pass up and gently used. I would order again from this person.
2,Not quite.,"The Beau Marks deserve better than this. Poor sound quality, shoddy artwork, no liner notes. The best songs are from a live LP they released well after their one big US chart hit (""Clap Your Hands""). Rerelease THAT album! A jazzy, hip, rockin' slice of post-Elvis, pre-Beatles nightclub fun, it would put this collection down like a rabid pooch.The Beau Marks, hometown boys, missing link between Memphis and Liverpool, defenders against the Horde of Bobbies (Vee, Curtola, Vinton, etc)...There's a story to be told here.Wait for the proper salute!"
2,Ok,These are pretty fun for a little while but the kids did not seem to stay interested in these for very long
2,fun to play with outside,"If you play laser tag with this set the laser can bounce off the walls and hit you when you are in a different room. I bought it and my sister and I put the vest on and we gave my dad a pair to play with, and he started shooting from the family room in a chair he was sitting in and he hit my sister and I from another room where we were hiding behind the couch. So I wouldn't by this unless you are able to play it outside, in a big area."
3,Keep Looking,"A lot of people rated LaserTag pretty high, so I went ahead and bought a set. After a full day of playing, it went back. While there are a lot of good points to this toy, there is still one that is absolutley required for it to be fun...You have to have even a little bit of consistency to the shots. Playing outside was probably the best way, as indoors even the wildest shots hit the other player. Pull the trigger as fast as you like, every shot hits (unless the other player covers the sensor on the gun).Out doors the shots seem to miss a lot more often. Too often. Several matches were held standing 5 feet away from each other and still we missed more than half the time.The most excellent functions (which were certainly present in these toys) won't save guns that have ""random accuracy"". Too bad."
4,eyeglasses too tight!,the eyeglasses that come with this are too tight for adult heads! They should be adjustable. They will give you a headache right away.
4,Loads of fun,A great game! Santa brought us two set (4 laser guns total) this past Christmas. My two boys (ages 5 and 9) and I run around the house playing laser tag a few times a week. After about an hour I'm exhausted but it's nearly impossible to get them to stop playing. Definitely worth it.
5,Best Laser Tag System,"This Lazer Tag system is the best, especially compared to other current competitors such as Laser Challenge. While it is twenty dollars more, it is twice as good in quality and fun. While it is true that the only sensor is on the gun, it doesn't dampen the fun quality at all.Two guns are good on their own, but to really get the full value out of these guns is to have a lot of guns (convince friends to purchase) and then have a massive war.Overall, the many features, well made gun, and smart design made this the best laser tag gun I have ever used."
5,best lazer tag ever made,when i went to buy it my friends came with me and bought a set too it was cool we had a battle when we got home
2,Durability a problem.,"My kids have been playing with these for two days and have had a blast. Unfortunately, two of the guns are already not working (one won't power up, and the other is locked up on one of the game screens). The other problem is that the guns don't have to be aimed at the target to score a hit. This takes a little of the fun out of the game."
5,looks cool,i dont have it but im getting it.it looks really cool and the otherlazer tag systems dont look asgreat as this. i would probablyreccomend it. i will write a newreview when i get it and try it. :)
2,don't get it,"this toy is good, but after a day or two this toy become borning don't buy it. the battery goes dead too!!! fast. don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Cass Elliott greatest hits,"Product was received in time, although there was a crack in the plastic casing it came in."
3,When is the REAL 'Dream a little dream' available on CD?,"Of course you could buy this CD. But then, you would have some overlap with Mama's Big Ones wouldn't you. So, supporting others who have mentioned this already: WHEN WILL MAMA'S ALBUMS BECOME CD'S? So that we can decide for ourselves which are her best songs? When will we all be able to hear a crackless version of Talking to your Toothbrush, for example, from her first album, the REAL Dream a little dream? And all those other little DIAMONDS? Come on record company; you don't know what's good for you!"
3,"Dream a Little Dream;, the Cass Elliot Collection","Takes you back a few years, and it is her distinctive, wonderful voice that makes it good. The first song and the theme song, the last selection, make it all worth listening to."
5,eye catching,I just got this watch delivered and when I opened the box I got this wow feeling. A very good looking watch indeed. According to another review writer who wrote that the watch look good when you are nice dressed or casual... well I sure agree with that. It looks tres chique !!I have several watches from Invicta and seiko but and this one is one of the best looking. The functions are also good but remember it looks like a chronograph but it isn't !!! The specialty of this watch is that you can see what the time is in other parts of the world. If I need a chronograph watch I simply change my watch to another of my collection.A very good looking watch for good money !! And lucky for me the euro is strong now these days so I even got a better deal.
1,heavy and big,"i bought this for my husband since he travels a lot, but it is too heavy and big, could be called a clock. i returned it. three weeks past , i have not get my money back"
4,"Good, solid acting",This movie makes you feel bad but in a good kind of way. The main kid actress did a very good job. Sad and real both at the same time.
4,"Taut, high-pitched adventure","A murderous woman on the loose. A sick philosophy spreading across the planet. Abused as a child, tortured as an adult, the evil Cassandra Mubarak plans to take over the world. And the only thing standing in her way? Lieutenant Flix Wenger and his allies from the Special Target Attack & Recon Team. Smart, athletic, daring, and a master of disguise, Flix infiltrates the enemy's stronghold. Like any good soldier, he does what he has to. Only then does he make a horrible discovery, a discovery too horrible to reveal on the back cover of a book. Now join Lieutenant Flix Wenger as he races against time to put a stop to Cassandra Mubarak's evil plans and save the woman he loves from a fate worse than death."
1,Infantile Characters,"I have read and enjoyed other Jane Feather books and purchased this particular book under the assumption that it would be just as readable. After pushing through a third of the book I gave up and went right to the conclusion. YAWN, what a waste of a tree to create this.....ugh, no words to describe what this story line is.....so I guess ""YAWN"" will suffice!"
3,Hardly-Larious,It was okay. i have been to his shows and is funny however his comedy is not meant for the audio world.
5,"Remarkable, A must read.","By using fiction, with an underlying love story to confront complex and difficult social, economic, and political issues in the metro New York area, Deep Glance speaks to the masses on issues of substance, without talking down to them. It's refreshing for the first tiem since 9/11, to find a book that examines the African American perspective in critical detail. In essence, Deep Glance has gone where no other writer their travel. Finally, the true spirit of democracy and freedom of expression, is once again alive once more, in a well written and excitng book. Readers who enjoy satire, and timely imagery, should defitely read Deep Glance. No household should be without a copy of this ground breaking publication."
3,Deep Alright,"Although the book was deep in that it touched upon many racial, social and class issues that are affecting urban communities across the nation, Deep Glance was a long read. Good for the beach."
3,*Mostly* Good Music ;),"This isn't marked as a late 70's or early 80's collection, but that's essentially what it is. These are songs anyone alive back then can sing with (""Don't Look Back,"" ""Want You To Want Me""), or at least will recognize if you can't place the name (""Just Between You And Me"").Perhaps what makes this such a great collection is that it's got some songs that are ""underrated hits""--that are consistently requested on classic rock radio stations, but are hard to find on CD--such as ""Lunatic Fringe"" and ""Never Been Any Reason."" (Those are, in fact, why I bought this CD.)However, I could live without Loverboy. I think we could ALL live without Loverboy. ;)Anyhow... That being said, the sound quality is *not* the best, but if you're just looking for the music, or something to keep in the car for those long commutes, you'll do well with this. Hoochie Koo, rock fans. :)"
3,It's OK but we've had better ones before,"From all the Claude Challe & Ravin collection, this is the slowest volume. It takes the listener way too deep into the oriental sounds turning the music kind of ethereal. I was looking for more beats and lyrics, like in the Buddah Bar Vol. I or II. The Nirvana Lounge compilation is a good example of an intermediate point between these concepts. Won't make you dance, but you if that's not your thing, you won't be dissapointed."
2,dissappointed,I was really dissappointed with Buddha-bar III. I have Buddha-bar II and listen to it all the time. I love ALL the songs and was expecting the same kind of diversity and quality of selection. Buddha-bar III is definitely missing the Claude Challe influence. Save your money on this one!!!
1,"Very slowly, without substance, repetitive.",Buda III repeats as the echo. Anything new that to offer?
4,Buddha Bar III,It is good mix of the music but the first two releases that were done with claude I loved them more. Claude you need to get Buddha Bar IV out.
3,Could be better :(,"It's an OK 2CD release but it just doesn't stand out comparing to previous Buddha Bar compilations by Claude Challe (they are definitely 5 stars!). I expected it to be better, but probably Ravin didn't get Claude's support this time as he did in Nirvana Lounge (another 5 star mix by Claude & Ravin), or may be there's just not enough good material these days..."
4,It is all in the lyrics....,Jean Beauvoirs first album by himself is a great collection of stories. Every song has it own stories and is full of great lyrics. The only bad thing about this album may be that he doesnt have a technical good voice but the lyrics moves you and more people than me should listen to this. Way to go Jean.....
4,Drums along the mohawk / Jacknifed,Both albums are really great. Jacknifed is awsome better than Drums along the Mohawk. Mike try Blue note records in Miami or(north Miami Beach) bought Drums along the Mohawk there 3 years ago. Feel the Heat (his best known song) is also the original soundtrack for the movie Cobra with Silvester Stalone.
2,seems unfinished and un-inspired,"After first listen of Lene's debut album ""Play With Me"", I was initially disappointed. But after a couple of listens the songs began to unravel and sink into until I noticed a couple of the songs really stand out and I really enjoy. But over all there was still a feeling of hollowness. Everyone knows that pop music and Aqua were created solely out of consumerism and a society leading more and more into quick fixes and disposable products but the two Aqua albums never left me with an aftertaste quite as strong as this one. All the songs appear to be about nothing. Scream is the one track the hints towards something a little more deep.However, on a more positive note, I found the tracks ""We Wanna Party"", ""It's Your Duty"", ""Bite You"", ""Scream"" and ""Virgin Superstar"" to be the highlights.So if you do intend on buying this album, try to wash down the taste with something a little more satisfying to the soul."
2,"Decent, but needed more polish","I expected more from one of my favorite lead singers. A couple songs are good, but it wasn't worth it buying the whole album. I think in her effort to transform into mainstream pop she watered everything down. The end result are songs that fail to generate any real emotion. Pass this one by."
2,One catchy track,"I basicaly got this for the one track ""It's Your Duty"" if you can find this track on a compilation you have the best song of this album.Oh well I got it now at least."
3,It's Your Duty Cuttie....,"This album is not as bad as many people has review it, this album is not comparable to any right now, but it's just pure dance-pop-rock, and Lene sounds like she's having fun with it..., the leading single ""It's Your Duty"" it's a great danceable track with a little funkyness in it, although it doesn't shows the mood impress mainly in the record, ""It's your duty"" it a reminder of how good pop song could get. The album mood I would say stay with a more rock oriented way. Another highlight in the album is ""Play With Me"", ""Virgin Superstar"", great album, that is eclectic in style, and Lene squeeke voice could work with the right promotion."
4,"80% filler, but still worth buying","There are only a couple of songs comparable to the quality of her work with Aqua, the rest have this incredible ""filler"" feeling to them.""Pretty Young"" thing is by far the best song IMO, ""Scream"" is also good, and the artwork is pretty cool."
5,Aqua-Lene,"This album is great - at first I was a little worried but I finally bought it and I am glad I did! All the songs are great and they are a lot better than what is playing now. Hopefully Lene hits the charts big, she deserves it!"
2,Not what I expected from the talented Lene...,"Lene's first exploration outside of Aqua falls short of what she is capable of. She has the voice and attitude to pull off songs that push the limit, but this album is closer to Britney's newer stuff than anything original. If you're into mainstream pop than you should love this album. As for fans of Aqua... I'm surprised that they like this cd. It's not fun like the stuff that Aqua put out. It's darker and more sexual, but not in a good way. It's also not as ""Dance"" oriented as their stuff.If you really feel that you need to check out this album I will recommend the song ""It's Your Duty"". It's got a great beat and will force you to chair/car dance. If she can pull of an entire album with this kind of sound then I think that she could be back on top of the charts.For now let's hope that she brings out ""It's Your Duty"" as a single. Then we'll wait for the second cd."
2,"wel, well..","i really don't understand how it got so many good reviews.. it's really not a very good cd.. maybe something on some of the songs has maybe a little bit good phrase, BUT THATS IT!! i only gave this album 2 stars, becouse she dated my.. oh, don't know what it is in english, but atleest a really good friend of my family.. but that was before she became an artist.."
1,pure garbage scrap,"pretty Young thing is a song of STELLA SOLEIL envisaged for a single, before the record compagny stop her contract.garbage recycled"
1,This is just bad.,"I can't believe how horrible this CD is. It sounds like a soundtrack to a second rate Disney movie. At least Aqua had a fun energy. This CD is total white bread.I thought Lene was supposed to be some kind of individual. She always says she had problems with Aqua because she wanted things to be done ""her way."" I guess ""her way"" is the dull mainstream pop way. It's a shame, really."
5,Still Tramaine,"This CD was a well kept secret, but after hearing ""Dedicated"", I knew I had to have the CD and I knew I could find it at Amazon. The CD did not disappoint me. I received it promptly after ordering it and it was securely packaged. Thank you."
5,Eric,"Fantastic product. Sound quality (MP3 @ 160 MBPS)is almost indistinguishable from my CD player, and I have a pretty high-end stereo system (Nakamichi amp, B&W speakers).Setup was a snap on Windows XP.Hands-down the easiest, cheapest way to play your MP3 files onto your home stereo with near-audiophile quality."
4,Solved my noisy soundcard problem,"I received this product last night and installed it in about 5 minutes to my Windows 98 SE machine. The reason I bought it was to get rid of the bad hum I was getting out of my soundcard, from a Dell laptop. It installed easily, and works as advertised. I now have no hum and decent quality music through my NAD amplifier and B&W speakers. There is a *little* noise, if I [turn] up the volume, but it's easily 1/10th of the hum I was getting through the sound card. So, I rate the sound quality as decent, but not really audiophile quality. Overall, for [the money], I am pleased with the better sound I am getting."
1,Total dud!,"I actually did quite a bit of research before choosing the XITEL HiFi-Link. The positive reviews must have come from the owners friends and family. The sound is muddier than the Mississippi. This sounds worse than my laptop speakers, no joke. I wish I had all of the packing materials so I could return it."
2,If you've got a decent sound card...,"...you probably don't need one of these.I'm feeling like an idiot right now because I bought this thing BEFORE I tried plugging my computer straight into my stereo. D'oh!!!A 1/8"" stereo plug-RCA adapter and RCA cable from Radio Shack do the same job as this thing. Just plug it into your computer's headphone jack, and you're all set. I did a side-by-side comparison between this thing and the stuff I bought at the Shack and there's NO discernible difference. I guess there are some situations where interference inside your computer and/or a weak sound card will make this not work so well, and in this case I'm sure this product would be perfect; it definitely works as advertised. But I would HIGHLY recommend you try the Radio Shack version for $12 before you buy one of these."
5,This really works...,"I got the Xitel HiFi-Link a number of months ago after seeing it on CNN. I love good music on as I work. I have a laptop and the quality of sound I got from my sound card when I tried to hook it to my stereo was terrible. The sound I get out of my stereo now that I am using this is extraordinary. Most of what I listen to are MP3's and Internet radio stations. I did not know they could sound this good. Frankly, at the price I was expecting much less. Even more impressive is that I just plugged it into my USB port and it worked...no software, no setup. I highly recommend the HiFi-Link."
5,Ground-breaking! Solinger has dared to tell the truth.,"When I first read Ricki Solinger's book I could not believe that she had hit upon the same phenomenon as I had discovered in my doctoral research. I found her work thorough, scholarly yet biting. In no way is it restricted to those women who lost their babies to the adoption industry, but is an insightful view into the repressed '60s which many like to think of as ""swinging' and sexually free. Read Solinger's work along with Wini Brienes' ""Young, White and Miserable"" and Susan Douglas's ""Where the Girls Are"" and you will get an accurate picture of what the '50s and'60s' were *really* like. I know - 'cause I was well and truly there."
4,speaking clearly,"Well except for the fact that I had to call the company to find out how to USE the speaker, it's great. In fact, the company person had to find out how to use it -- it's not in the manual. Once we got that secret uncovered, I was very satisfied with the phone. Now all we need is the same technology on cell phones of drivers in front of me on the road."
3,A low cost dual line phone does the basic,"I was looking for a wireless dual lines phone with caller ID, speaker phone to use in my home office.Pro - low costn ($35), dual lines, lighted key pad.con - distance, low volumn.The voice volumn is on the low side; but it is usable. The distance is limited to about 50'."
4,"Decent phone, but 2.4 GHz interferes with WLAN","This is a decent phone, I think. The support for 2 lines is great, except on the phone itself you can't change the ringer volume per line... I wanted it to ring on line 1 and not on line 2, but you can only specify that on the base itself.Also the interface is quite confusing.The absolute worst thing about this phone is that it interferes with my 802.11 wireless! When the phone is ringing or in use, the computer's on the wireless LAN get entirely disconnected, and cannot reconnect until the phone is no longer communicating. So only buy this phone if you don't use WLAN and don't intend to in the near future."
3,Somone actually took this book seriously.,"Upon reading the first couple of pages I thought to myself...""this is some of the most hilarious satire I've ever read"". As I read on, I realized that this guy is actually serious. Jeff Godwin believes that everyone from Abba to Zappa is involved in a worldwide satanic conspiracy to take over the world. This guy really needs to get a life. He actually quotes supermarket tabloids like The Globe as sources for this book. It is poorly written, but if you enjoy a good laugh, check it out."
1,ha a ha ha ha ha.... snort.,"The title sums up my reaction to this work, and the reaction of everyone I passed it along to. Mr. Godwin (who is (or was) published by Jack Chick, the master of the mini-comic tract) is much given to misinterpretation, misquoting, general cluelessness, and outright lies. It's almost impossible to believe that someone could maintain such an air of naivety and unrealism, even for money, and downright sad to believe that others would actually pay for it and believe it for real."
5,Gets into your head,"Crosby and the Andrews Sisters were made for each other.The harmony is great, the music unforgetable.One small warning... If you find tunes get stuck in your head,beware... this album is full of tunes that just won't go away(not that you'd want them to anyway.)From the songs I knew and have always loved to those that Ihad never heard before... There isn't a bad one in the bunch.The first song on Album 2 has been running thru my head fordays. ""Tomorrow Morning is My Wedding Day"" and I don't recallever hearing it before. The last 5 cuts on Album 2 are bloopersand show the great fun Bing and the girls had making theserecords.They all started on vinal, but have beeen remastered to bebetter than ever.If you pass this one up you'll end up kicking yourself...Roger - Tampa"
4,Not quite there,I'm a fairly new Mac user. This book is directed mainly at Windows users. You do need to understand which parts are only relevant to Windows because the book doesn't tell you. Otherwise it's good.
2,Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 Classroom in a Book,"This is really for the casual user of photoshop, more oriented toward home use, and family pictures, and vacation pictures, and so on. A big orientation of the book is toward organizing and tagging photos. It lacks explanation of the functions of photoshop. If you follow the lessons, you will get a result, but may not understand what you have done. Professionals will not be happy with this. I have not found an adequate book on the subject. Purchase only if you have EXACTLY the version of Photoshop elements 3.0."
2,Disappointed on Long Island,I should have read the reviews before I bought it. I'm a Mac user. Need I say more!
1,WARNING! Windows only!,Mmm...a program whose beginnings were firmly entreched on the Macintosh platform and now a book that IGNORES that platform completely coming from the developer themselves!?Pretty lame! Mac users go look at PeachPit press books instead.
3,A good cookbook.,"I call this book a ""cookbook"" because it consists of ""projects,"" using the photos provided on the CD-ROM, with detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do a number of tasks to categorize and improve digital photos. The ""recipes"" are quite good and, if followed carefully, produce the desired results. I rate it at only three stars because it is all ""how to,"" with very little ""why."" Having worked through each and every project as a beginner, I think it gave me a pretty good start on understanding the program. I'm now shopping for a book with greater depth, including advice on how to take better pictures in the first place."
5,this author makes everything crystal clear,"Geshe Kelsang Gyatso makes very difficult Buddhist concepts and practices crystal clear. To me, his books are indespensible. All of his books are like textbooks to be referred to time and again for reference. This and Clear Light of Bliss are great tantric Manuals.Dakini Land is another Tantric work by this author and is highly rated. I will be purhasing this one shortly.Topics covered in the reviewed book- Isolated speech, Isolated Mind,Isolated Body. Description of lower tantras and Highest Yoga Tantra.How to advance from Generation stage to completion stage. In short, another great book by this author."
2,It OK,I got this CD b.c there was one song that came on the radio that i loved. I got the CD and that one song was the only one could take. its an OK CD but I wouldnt tell others to buy it.
5,By far the best CD in a long time!,"Toya's self-titled debut CD is a great mix of pop and R&B. I first saw Toya on MTV and then went and bought the CD-Single for her song ""I Do!!"". That's just one of the remarkable songs on the disc. The whole CD is fun to listen to and every song on the album is catchy. I wasn't quite sure that I would like the CD when I bought it. But after listening to it, I have to admit Toya has a great talent for singing. I strongly recommend this album to everyone.Also recommended: Blu Cantrell's ""So Blu""."
3,Not All That Good...,"You may hear her song ""I Do!!"" on the radio a lot, but the album isn't all about that. No catchy tunes. Just a bunch of r&b songs mixed together so this girl can make money. I really don't think you should buy this, unless youre into repeative r&b wannabe tunes. The best song on the album is the second single ""No Matta What (Party All Night)"". It's a great song, the other good songs are ""Moving On"", ""I Do"", The Truth"" and ""I Do pt. 2"". Other wise, the other songs all sound the same"
5,Buy this album! We must support music like this.,"All I can say is that I love this album. If you like great musicians doing their thing, this is it. Neil Larsen, keyboards and Buzz Feiten, guitar are at the height of what they do best on this album. Buzz Feiten especially shines. I cannot get through this album without picking up my guitar and trying to play along. It is so inspiring. The rhythm, the solo's....this is a must. We have to support music like this."
5,Buy now,"12 condoms, low price, and they are in date. the ones i just got are good until 2016. there really is no question, this is a great buy!"
5,All right,"I purchased way to many of these things, as a matter of fact a big big bag full. At my age I don't think I will ever use them all but that is fine because so far none of them have broken. If I was still young I would use them for water balloons and throw them at cars."
2,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product Rough Rider is not Rough Rider.,Size is not right by any mean and it is too tight.The lube is enough to soak you in to have batter feeling.
3,Works,There were quite a few just wish they had more lube on them. Otherwise they are great. I would buy them again.
2,Not a good fit,"We thought we would try this for a little extra sensitivity. Bad Idea. I'm sure I ordered large, but this was too tight to install. When I did get it on, it was quite uncomfortable. Maybe for someone a little smaller, it would be OK. Sorry."
3,ergo chair,"should have a side pocket and the screws cut into a larger framed person, we needed to take it and have cap covers put on. the benefit is someone who has trouble getting up- the height helps"
2,Stitled grammar - boo!,"I was recommended this book by a colleague. While I'm sure the subject is interesting, the writing here is just terrible. If you need 7 commas in a sentence you're doing it wrong. On a good day my high school English teacher would have given this a D. I couldn't force myself to read past page 20. I'm sure there are versions of this subject written by competent writers. I'm off to find one."
1,Never Got to See The Movie - Kindle Download Problem,I downloaded this movie to see on a plane. I was never able to get it to play. It appeared that the movie kept looking to download from the Cloud when I had specifically downloaded it to the Kindle device. I had this happen to another movie later in the trip. I thought that I could have made a mistake downloading but was able to download a different movie without a problem at an earlier time. Anyone else have difficulty with downloading movies to the Kindle?
1,UltraSCAM,"Don't get suckered by this product. If you care at all about digital copies... you'll be very, VERY disappointed. Movie was good, too bad it's bundled with crappy product. Boom! #ProductReviews"
2,Hate this UltraViolet Digital Copy stuff,"Took forever to sign up for two different services (UltraViolet and Flixster) that are mandatory to get the digital copy, and found out in the end that it won't play on my iPod Touch. Very fine print only on the web site says it works only on iPod's with 3G or 4G service. I watch my movies on airplanes and streaming certainly doesn't work there. I've got way too many digital services already and I certainly don't want or need these. Amazon and iTunes is plenty for me already.If they are going to go this route, then just sell me a Blu-Ray, DVD set and leave the faux digital copy off. I'm not going to pay for it."
2,boringball,"slowwwwww, a waste of the talents presented. The baseball lover in the family told me it was a good movie ~ but you've got to LOVE baseball to like this movie. I LIKE baseball, but not this movie."
1,Ultraviolet == Ultra Lame,I went to buy this and then saw the digital copy is an ultraviolet copy. No one uses stupid flixster or whatever this is. Everyone uses iTunes and iOS devices.This is stupid.
1,Boring,I can't believe Brad Pitt was nominated for Oscar best actor. Must be because he is Angelina's room mate. I can't believe how boring this movie was. One would think it was made for cheap TV.
1,"Ok, based on a true story. So what? Not all that interesting.","And so Oscar nominated for best picture of 2011???? And Brad Pitt for best actor??? You have to be kidding me on both accounts. This is a slow, very slow, drama with a subject most will care little about. My take on this movie is that it was a Brad Pitt project of some kind and in retrospect, should have been very cheap to produce as really not much more than a stage play with limited scenery sets and actors. Honestly, how could anyone get all that emotionally involved in a movie that has only ""baseball team member selection"" at its core???? Intended audience? Perhaps 30+ year old males with a love of baseball but no one else. If you have a wife or girlfriend and although they may love Pitt, do not try this movie on them. No sex, no violence, no nothing of note or interest. Oscar nomination for best picture????? ""The Help"" is 1000 times better in all reguards that this turkey. Not recommended."
3,ok movie,"The movie was ok. Interesting story, Brad Pitt acting was only marginally average. This movie is more of a renter than a buyer."
2,inside baseball is ugly,Moneyball is a waste of 2 hours of your life. The production is terrible. Pathetic cinematography. The story is a 20-minute documentary spread very thin. The acting is weak. High school thespians could do as well. Brad Pitt looks and acts wasted.
2,Reviewer #1,This is a mediocre movie that was unbelievably boring and over-rated. I would not recommend it. I don't understand why it was nominated for an Academy Award. Pure politics. This was Brad Pitt's worst role.
5,Fun movie,"We watched this movie last night and really liked it, a good one to add to the keeper collection. I often skip sports-themed movies because they all seem so been there-done that, but this one was pretty original and it was fun to watch. I'm not really familiar with Jonah Hill, but he was fantastic in this movie and the scenes with him in it were my favorite. The acting across the board was excellent. I like that they kept it clean so anyone can watch it."
3,movie review,"I dont understand why Brad Pitt got a academy award nomination for this thing, but it was a alright movie any way. it was historic and accurate as far as i know. The brief moments of excitement were few and far between though. I dont see the need for the daughter role in this movie. To me it was just filler space. The ball player doing the strip dance was choking for air during his speech, he was not very belivable. The dance was good but not the acting."
3,Left feeling flat,The movie was ok. It just left me feeling a bit flat. I never got that real feeling of underdog over comes. Oh well I was still entertained.
2,Doomed from the Outset,"Moneyball, the book, was about the application of statistics to baseball management. The subject connects with gamblers, would be gamblers, sports fans in general, and (I suppose) econometricians. It was great if you like that kind of stuff, but there's really nothing in that volume you can put on a screen. Nothing.From beginning to end, the movie searches for sources of dramatic tension. Few of them are in the book; all of them fall short. It tries to buttress the threadbare and desultory plot line with character development that is... threadbare and desultory. I don't know what they paid for the rights, but 80% of what they got was the title and its associated good will.In the end it wasn't terrible. It just wasn't good."
2,An inarticulate film,"I really wanted to like this film but found that the interesting idea behind it -- forming a team not out of expensive stars but out of just the right players -- was given only about five or six sentences in the whole film. Most of the time we were watching Brad Pitt looking frustrated or driving around Oakland or walking around the Oakland Colosseum. Poor Jonah Hill has very few lines. Most of the time he seems tongue-tied. We watch the players playing but often don't quite know what we're supposed to be looking for. The flashbacks to the Pitt character's youth seem mostly gratuitous. I gave this film two stars instead of one because the photography was competent by today's low standards and because the baseball scouts, office people, etc. seemed very authentic. Otherwise, if you don't like using many words to explain an idea, why not just make a silent movie?"
2,Dull dull dull,"MONEYBALL is well-produced but ultimately boring. In fact, a documentary on this subject would have been more interesting. Imagine a film with almost no action whatsoever, not even the hackneyed, repetitive shots of people playing the game, except in passing, and with quiet mumbling performances in a film about a topic of no significance. It's not funny. It's not enlightening. It's not exciting. It's not artistically adventurous. Even one of those elements might have made the movie worth watching; but it has none of them. You have to wonder why this movie was made in the first place. I had the opportunity to see it for free and I could not make it to the end."
4,Another true story sports film,"Like so many that have been coming out lately (i.e., The Blind Side, Secretariat, etc.), this one is right there with these. If you are an avid sports fan, you should enjoy this film. The story is about Billy Bean, general manager (and still is) of the Oakland A's. The story revolves around how a small market baseball team can ever compete with the big boys... ala New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. An excellent story, it takes you through Billy's gamble to rethink and reinvent how baseball is done with respect to obtaining talent and value for it.If you are a fan of baseball, this would be a must own. Since I am a fan of the Kansas City Royals, it also gives us ""poor folk"" a bit of sunshine and hope that we can again be competitive and not relegated to a glorified minor league franchise for the ""big boys"" to come and steal our talent away. I think this is one of Brad Pitt's better films (and I am not a big fan of his)."
4,Movie Was a Great Gift,I sent this to my dad for his birthday. I feel like it is a great baseball movie that also tells us that you don't have to spend a lot of money on a Major League Baseball roster in order to have a talented team. Great movie!
4,Brad Pitt's Best Role,"Brad Pitt over acts almost everything. In my opinion, however, this is his best role since Seven. Looking forward to WWZ."
4,liked,I enjoyed the movie from being a baseball fan it was a good documentary on fixation on one way to do things
3,Good Baseball movie,"I love baseball movies, especially movies that follow true stories like Moneyball did. I enjoyed the story, as someone who lived in Oakland during this era, it was both nostalgic and enlightening. The faults lie in the performance that Brad Pitt gives. He eats pretty much the whole way through the entire film (as he tends to do in movies) and it's disgusting. It's hard to watch a scene when he's there chomping like a horse with a carrot. It's very distracting unless the sight of people eating with their mouthes open doesn't bother you. That being said, Pitt does have moment when you can see the decent actor in him shining through. There were moments of comedy and moments that were touching but more than anything, for a baseball fan, this movie can take you back to a moment in time when baseball changed for the underdogs. It'd give this movie 4 stars if it weren't for the chomping."
3,baseball fan,The Oakland A's was a favorite team of my family during this time. It was interesting to hear the familiar names and find out the inner workings of the changes made at the time.
2,Moneyball,"Entertaining movie, only to be left with, WTF, ending. Left with, Why did I watch this movie. Save your money. Wait for Netflix, or even a TV movie."
1,Nope. Sorry. Not buying UltraViolet. Not ever.,"That's it really. I love this movie, but I've seen it once in a theater -- and I'd rather NEVER see it again, rather than pay for an UltraViolet anything. Period.Any movie. Any time. Never buying UltraViolet."
2,Books are always better...,This movie was so much longer than it needed to be. I suggest reading the book and never wasting the time to watch the movie.
1,"Good film, weak streaming from Amazon","Moneyball is a strong film and one of Brad Pitt's best performances. But Amazon's instant streaming is very disappointing. I'm streamed hundreds of films on Netflix with no problems whatsoever. The Amazon service delivered a low-resolution picture that stopped three times to download the rest of the file. And even though I paid the purchase price, the file won't play on my iPad or iPhone. I won't be buying this product from Amazon again."
4,Good movie for sports fans,"If you are a sports fan you will like this movie. Language is a bit rough for younger kids, but no nudity or violence."
5,You don't need to like baseball to like it.,"I am a baseball, but you don't have to like baseball to like this movie. Its a story about human struggle against all odds. Loved it!"
4,Clint Eastwood Autobiography,I did feel like Clint was writing about his own life. Good family film for kids 13 & up. I would say at least that old because of the story & language.
1,TECHNICAL ISSUE - BAD DISC!,"I purchased this DVD back in February as a gift for my mother. It wasnt until December that she decided to open it and watch it. When she put it in the DVD player, it would not load and the DVD player said ""BAD DISC"". Other DVDs work fine - it is just this disc that will not load/play. This was a waste of money since I can no longer return or exchange it. I recommend trying out DVDs as soon as you get them in case you experience the same issue. (On another note: I saw the movie in the theater, and loved it!)"
2,Moneyball,"A lot of stop and atart with the playback, lots of interruptions while it buffered. The movie itself was way too long and just kind of boring"
1,moneyball,I bought this dvd for a gift and it was defective. I replaced the dvd with one I bought at Walmat.
1,I wish it were good,"I thought with all the buzz I heard about this film, the fact that it stars brad pitt, that it would be a must see, but it turned into a must bore.Seriously miscast and a terrible script. I couldn't sit through it all."
1,VERY SLOW,THIS WAS AN OK DVD BUT VERY SLOW AND FOR ME AND MY BOYFRIEND WHO IS A BASEBALL NUT. IT WAS JUST OK.
5,Awesome Movie!!,"This is a GREAT show! I bought this thinking it was going to be a yawner, but was pleasantly surprised. Great show of a great story performed by great professionals."
5,good movie,"was not sure if I would like this movie, but I was totally surprised--the movie was very good--really good.--buy it"
4,Good Movie for a true story,Ist always good to watch Brad Pitt in an excelent movie and spend the afternoon in front of the tv
3,Baseball shouldn't be uninspiring,The movie was slow and not at all inspiring. I expected more. I just couldn't get into the behind the scenes action of owners and managers arguing.
4,An interesting piece of History,I always root for the underdog and this movie gave me a chance. Sorry the A's ddn't take it all the way but the movie was a good look at all the behind the scenes BS that goes on in Big League Baseball.
3,Moneyball,"Was sort of dark through out the movie, baseball movies should be bright sunshine, green grass, and blue sky. It was emotional when Billy rallied and interacted with the team near the end. It's not as good as Bull Durham or Field Of Dreams or Rookie Of The Year."
4,Moneyball,"This is a very interesting explanation of how baseball works behind the scenes. Maybe I'm the last to understand thatbaseball success, like all other sports, is never accidental."
4,Bradd Pitt vs Tom Cruise,"Brad Pitt's performance was not an Oscar winner but four stars is what I give this picture because of his supporting cast and the overall sentiments in this movie. The suspense builds and the movie viewer is left with the question....why didn't he go for the money in the end? Was he THAT attached to his team and weren't his kids old enough to move to another location. I had no idea that statistics played such a big role in baseball picks or that salaries and managing players could be so complex, so it was an education. I still go back to Tom Cruise and his ""show me the money"" line, a hard one to beat."
5,Moneyball,"Brad Pitt at his finest, Jonah Hill at his finest too! Fantastic movie which I highly recommend to anyone who really enjoys a great movie with a great storyline. You definitely need to buy this one!"
4,Money Ball,I enjoyed this film a lot and Brad Pitt did a great job as Billy Bean as did his co-star as the numbers guy.
2,Zzzzzzzzz,"This movie does not deserve the hype. It is dull, emotionless and rather pointless. I kept waiting for something, anything even remotely interesting to happen. I wish I had pulled Field of Dreams out of my collection and watched that again instead."
5,Money!,"Brad Pitt was born to play this role. He dominates the screen as A's General Manager Billy Beane. The story is brilliantly brought to the screen with stellar performances, a lot of humor and touching moments with family. This is one of the few movies I have ever watched twice in the same week. Ironically titled in that the management of this team was based on a LACK of money."
5,Not a big baseball fan but...,"my partner is and we both really enjoyed this one. I also managed to learn quite a bit about baseball and now we watch the Cardinals together on MLB.tv via our PS3. I understand what is going on in the game a bit better because of watching this and now we have something we can watch together, nearly every day, that doesn't bore us both to tears."
5,Great,Another great sports movie! I never get tired of watching this movie. Plus it is based on a true story which is a big bonus.
2,Guess I'm not a Brad Pitt Fan,Was it just me or did it seem like Brad Pitt was just walking around a movie set talking? I could not focus on the story (not that it was a riveting storyline) for always noticing the poor acting by Mr. Pitt. Me thinks the fellow is perhaps over-rated -- at least in this movie. His non-acting was such a distraction that I really got little from the movie at all.
5,"An Amazing Story, Well Done Film","Moneyball concerns a true story in which the Oakland A's attempt to compete against wealthy MLB franchises that keep buying players with massive budgets. Rather than try to compete head to head, they develop a strategy using statistics, redefining what is important in constructing a winning team."
2,Perfect movie to put you to sleep,"This movie is another one of his most boring films. I have trouble sleeping and thankfully this film was the best yet to accomplish that most difficult task of sleeping. Rarely an exciting moment, if ever there was one. I normally would've rated this movie a 1 Star for extremely boring and/or dull, but the acting wasn't bad so I had to be fair. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you're the biggest nerd out there and can stay focused long enough and really, really care that much about baseball."
1,BEWARE,"This release uses Ultraviolet for the digital copy. As it states in the description it requires the Silverlight client for downloads to be viewed. Do not be surprised when there is no iTunes compatible downloadable file and you will have to, yet again, have a special client to view the digital copy. So, now we have what? Flixster and Silverlight required to view Ultraviolet digital copies as well as the client WE CHOSE (in my case, iTunes and Windows Media)? I wonder how many more trojan horse applications we will have to install in order to watch the digital copy WE PAID FOR. Of course, it's only good for a year as well so...BEWARE.Ultraviolet is the worst."
3,Moneyball is a glimpse into a scary future.,"I was told by a friend that this movie was about ""A ball of money that belongs to the MLB that Brad Pitt must retrieve before a bomb goes off."" To my surprise though, it was actually about computers making baseball teams up. Now, I am not a big fan of computers thinking for themselves after watching movies like The Terminator, The Matrix and other movies, but to my surprise I fell in love with this movie.While Brad Pitt was fine in the film, it was Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character that stood out to me the most. His actions and words brought a certain sense of believability to an otherwise emotionless, computer controlled world. It doesn't hurt that Mr. Hoffman isn't hard on the eyes either. Unfortunately, his scenes are to few and far between so I had to take off two stars. Don't let that dissuade you though, this movie lays the groundwork for more computer/sport movies, and I believe this genre will take off after this. Defiantly a ""home run!"""
3,Follows the book well,"Not a great movie - OK at best, but it does follow the book reasonably well. It could be a PG but there is one F-bomb in the whole movie. Why bother?"
5,A classic.,"If you love or even like baseball, this is a must see movie. Brad Pitt is great in this movie and the plot is based off a true story and just a great story altogether. Great price and fast shipping."
3,Much Less than expected,This movie is just so-so. It covers the story of the manager of the Oakland A's baseball team and how he changed the way management hired and fired players.He adopts the use of statistics versus the old school methods of hunches and crowd appeal. This movie looks like a pet project of Brad Pitt. It never ignites.
4,Good movie,"This movie was good and I enjoyed it, but if you fall for all the hype you could be a little disappointed. I would definitely recommend watching it!"
4,Charming fiction,"Never let the facts get in the way of a good story, and this is a very good, cinematic story. Enjoy the ride, and don't worry about how much of it is distorted, exaggerated or untrue. I was an American League baseball beat writer during those years and walked those clubhouses. But I'm still a sucker for a good baseball story and will happily suspend disbelief when it's entertainment, rather than documentary. The script is solid, as are the acting and directing, if not quite worthy of ""Best Picture."" My favorite baseball movie of all time, ""A League of Their Own,"" also was ""based"" on a true story, and those liberties with fact do not bother me. The Special Features with the real Billy Beane are good. One small complaint: ""Moneyball"" looks a little grainy, which I assume was a decision of the director or cinematographer. That's fine for a period piece like ""Stand By Me,"" but for ""Moneyball,"" I would have preferred a sharper picture."
5,Watch this now. NOW!,"Although past volumes in the GITS:SAC series have brought together loose ends to form a beautiful and cohesive whole, volume 6 frays those ties and sets the stage for a possibly epic ending to the SAC series. The first episode on the disk begins and ends with no less mystery then when it started, but lets just say that you'll finally find out what the laughing man looks and feels like. The second episode shows to what means the enemies of Section 9 are willing to do to hide the truth. While the third and final episode is mostly just talking, I would go so far as to say that it is just as thrilling as action packed episodes such as Jungle Cruise or The Laughing Man. While it is slightly annoying that there is a mere three episodes on the DVD, I must say that it would be worth your money to buy this product. Unless your too afraid."
4,"Top Notch Anime, Over the Top Prices","This is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves. The storyline is great, but this should have been the last DVD. Things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over $20. That's bogus. DVDs can fit way more episodes on a single disc, and it's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately. The Cowboy Bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start, then dropped down to 4. Now it's just getting worse. At this point I'm starting to regret buying the Stand Alone Complex series instead of renting it. I am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out, though. Throughout the series I think disc 4 was my favorite."
3,Not so much,"A little hard to follow, sometimes strung out then felt like it was jumping around, I liked the ending, even though I had figured out the killer long before, I love love the Samantha sweet books by same author, so this was kind of disappointment"
2,Cardboard,"I generally love female dectives; however, Charlie is a cardboard character. Mostly, she gets out of her fixes by pure luck and not by any skill or thought of her own. I just can't respect this character.. The author needs to try again -- this time with a heroine with brains."
3,First half was pretty good,"This book started off great. I loved how every page was directly related to the mystery...no irrelevant side stories. I liked Charlie too. As an amateur detective, i found her methods to be very realistic. She followed the trail, asked questions and didn't do anything illegal or dangerous. Unfortunately, about halfway through the book, the conclusion became obvious. I wish the other characters' motives were more developed so the suspense could have been maintained. One part of the book i found odd was the relationship Charlie developed with the victim's 17 year old son. She was acting like his mother--helping him clean the house, making him breakfast, etc. I guess she originally thought he could help her investigation, but then it just got weird."
1,Really poor procedural,"I really liked the characters, setting, and the writing. However, it is impossible for me to believe the ALB police would not have searched the victim(s) home for evidence and would leave it there for the protagonist to find so easily. I have to give this a one star."
1,bad gamble,deadly gamble reads like an early writing class submission. some promise but needing basics like plot subplot character development. etc. the dog was best devloped most interesting character.
3,Deadly Gamble,Quick read. Main character is okay. It was just an okay read. Main character could be more interesting for the book.
1,"Weak plot, waste of time.","What I thought would be a tantalizing murder mystery was unfortunately the complete opposite. The plot was horribly weak and never really pulled me in or made me an avid reader. I hate to not finish a book so I continued reading, counting down the pages until the less than satisfying ending. The book read more like a journal, routinely spending a ridiculously long time depicting what the subject ate for meals, what and when her dog ate, when she slept, what she wore and when her dog went outside. As colorful as these examples were, the meat and potatoes of the book was colorless and underdeveloped. In my opinion, a poor use of my time."
2,OK book,"Nothing to write home about, it was OK,, but she sure isn't Robert Patterson or Robert parker! I wouldn't read it again"
2,"Pleasant, but pokey",I could not get past the first two chapters. This was obviously written for a young audience (high school?)..
2,"Please, no more junk food!","This was a lukewarm story, at best...characters behaving illogically, the couch potato ""sleuth"" stopping every hour on the hour for more greasy junk food. I have never read book in my life where the main character, or any character, for that matter, ate food so incessantly and it became a total turnoff for me, about halfway through the book. If a real person ate the type of diet the main character did, they'd be dead within a month. The writing was almost juvenile and the plot sort of meandered along until coming to an anticlimactic fizzle at the end. All I all, a wasted effort. There are apparently people out there who like this type of junk, and that is a shame. On the whole, simply not a believable tale. Big Mac,anyone?"
2,Rather disappointed,"I know I only paid 1.59, but I expected a little more. Too much fluff, not enough substance. The characters were not developed very well."
3,Quick read kept the pages turning,"Good read, thought I had it figured out but was pleasantly surprised I was wrong! Think more should have been detailed on Stacy 's character."
3,Deadly Gamble,"It was an okay book. The story held my interest, but the plot was somewhat predictable. That all she wrote!"
3,To easy to solve,I don't think an acconntant could get away with doing the work of a PI and not get arrested for messing up thecrime scene. Unbelievable and waste of time. I knew almost from the start who the murderer really was. sorry about the mispelled words inhere. to correct them I have to erase everything to grt back to them. I am sure you still get what I am saying. Hope the author gets better in her next books.
3,A woman's view on crime!,"A good, organized, method of solving a murder. Very detailed explanation of how to find clues. Most of the details add to the story, except for those about the dog!"
3,"Good Book, But Very Familiar...","I enjoyed this book. It's not overly sophisticated, but if you like this genre its a good read. BUT has anyone else noticed that it really draws from the Stephanie Plum series? I almost made of game of tallying up the similarities as I read. I mean even just the pace of the main character driving around visiting people, the big dog, the constant eating and food descriptions that are sooooo characteristic of the Stephanie Plum books. It seems like the author sort of copied the tempo of those books and substituted some things and made it less slapstick than Janet Evanovich's writing. If you like Stephanie Plum, I guess you will like this."
4,A good read,"Charlie Parker Mystery #1 is a good read. It is a little light perhaps (no really evil villains, no all-or-nothing desperate situations, just a good mystery to untangle), but light is good fare too sometimes. I like Charlie Parker and will read more of the series."
4,"Good, but...","Others have summed up the book, so I'll just add my thoughts.I enjoyed the book overall, but found that it lacked ""rhythm"". I can't explain it, but it just didn't come together smoothly. Passages describing everyday scenes seemed to be padded and those with action seemed rushed.Better editing would have been helpful, too. Catchy descriptors would used for two different things in the same scene. That was kind of jarring.Work needs to be done on metaphors, too. As Charlie enters a neighborhood bar, she describes the music's ""vivaciousness"" as making the ice in the drinks jiggle. Huh?I enjoyed the first one enough, though, that I've downloaded a sample of the second to my Kindle and will probably buy it."
2,Disappointed,"Guess it might have been worth $1.59 but not anymore. I think this author has promisebut needs a lot more work. The main character is likeable enough but is no ""character"".Same for the others, mostly very ordinary and predictable. I do like it that she hada dog and surragate grandmother.There was a lot of ""fluff"" that added absolutely nothing and drives me crazy. Used myspeed reading skills with this one a lot.Plot had twist but nothing a mystery reader might not have already seriously considered.At least it wasn't too long."
3,Okay but took a long time to get into it,"I enjoy a good mystery, but this one was only so so. I kept reading it, hoping I would like the character better, and that the story would get more interesting. It did, about halfway through. I might try one more, now that I know the characters and writing style, but I can't at this point recoommend it."
4,the series gets better with each book,"As this is a work of fiction, the author is allowed to take liberties with procedures, remember it's a story....That said after reading the first in the series, I knew that I wanted to read them all, so I downloaded them to my Kindle. I've finished the series and now feel I know the characters and am privy to their lives. Reading allows me to travel as I'm pretty much a homebody. Seeing the sights and experiencing places that I probably will never venture. The author also introduces differently prepared foods that urges her readers to try something rather than their ordinary fare. Keep up the good work and if you enjoy reading for pleasure, then by all means read the entire series."
3,Slow Start,"I rated low because the story line was slow to pique my interest. But it did, and I finished the book. As with any book, read the description and make your decision. I'm currently reading VACATIONS CAN BE MURDER by this author. This takes place on the Hawaiian Island, Kauai. My daughters were on that island as I read the DEADLY GAMBLE and it piqued my interest to read the second book."
4,Good read,"I liked this book, kept me turning the pages and good descriptive writing. My only complaint is that towards the end I could tell who the killer was based on the unusual amount of attention/focus given to that individual (didn't seem realistic). In any case, I still enjoyed the book and would recommend, especially for the price of .99!"
5,Great Book,"Charlie Parker is a female accountant who winds up doing a job as a private eye for her ex-best friend. Charlie's brother is the real PI, but she can't resist helping because she begins to feel sorry for the old friend who once stole her boyfriend.There are a lot of twists and turns to this tale and it is well-written. The characters are strong, the plot is solid. What else can I say? It is an excellent read.Well Done!AmandaI'll read the next book in this series. I'll be watching for it."
4,deadly gamble,i am glad that i read the first one now i know what to look forward to quite enjoyable can't wait to read the next one
2,nothing remarkable,Pretty much what anyone can get off the internet. Nothing remarkable. CD pretty lame and unsophisticated.
1,Dog Treats? maybe. Jerky? heck no!!,"this company, Golden Valley Natural, should be embarrassed to market this awful product. I would only use these things as doggy treats.... not fit for human consumption. Don't waste your money!!"
5,"Excellent, accesible American poetry.","Mary Oliver's American Primitive is one of the finer books of poetry written in America in the last fifty years. The poetry is simple, yet profound, and has intense energy and vitality. The poet never wastes a word or an idea, and though the poems have few humans beings they speak directly and movingly to the human condition."
2,I'm glad I read Dream Work before American Primitive!,"American Primitive won the Pulitzer prize but did not win my heart, my mind, my thoughts. I could not become enthusiastic or excited about the poet's words. They were bland, dull and had no meaning of consequence. None of her poetry struck me as a ""mantra"", words I would entrust to my soul and would embrace, as part of my living. I was saddened that this was the book that received so much acclaim. Shame, Shame! In contrast to Dream Work, this book is shabby. I am thankful I read Dream Work prior to reading American Primitive. If the sequence had been reversed, I would never have been exposed to the loveliness and sensibility of Dream Work."
1,floridly excessive new-age similes...,You have got to be kidding... this is the worst drivel since Rod Mckuen. If this is the sort of psuedo-therapeutic garbage that passes for poetry today I will gladly pull my own eyes out.
4,Vintage Richard,"Persuaded is wonderful!! It has a blend of praise, worship, classical, latin, and jazz that is definitely characteristic of anything Richard Smallwood does! The Anthem of Praise moves you into God's presence right from the beginning of the CD. Psalm 8 is beautiful worship. AND he has a piano solo (It is well with my soul) that is awesome. This CD is definitely anointed and it makes you wish you were in DC when it was recorded."
5,Music From Heaven,I listened to Persuaded on my way across country and on the plane. It was very comforting and relaxing to hear. The melodies are beautiful and Richard Smallwood has a very unique way of composing music that speaks to the heart. His harmony is very unusual and makes me imagine the way they praise the Lord around His throne continually. I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys contemporary Christian music that is anointed of God and does not have a gimmick or commercial feel. It is real.
2,Nearly worthless,"I wasted too much money on stuff like this when I was younger. This kind of book can be entertaining if you enjoy the pictures and want to learn about materials, but if you are looking for a book about how to draw, look elsewhere. Get it from the library, because it loses it's entertainment value pretty fast."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"If you want to draw dont get this, all it does is tell you about what things you need and about drawing items that your probably don't even have! NO CHARATERS TO EVEN DRAW"
1,This book was a total waste of money!,"This book sucks! It should not be labeled ""How to draw Manga"" because it doesn't teach you how to draw anything. I am no a manga artist but I would like to get started and I thought I would get this book because it was called ""Getting started"". I would not recomend this book to anyone. If I could, I would give this book no stars."
4,"Quite Literally ""Getting Started""","While some may jump to the conclusion that this book will immediately cover the greater mechanics and techniques for drawing in the Manga style, it is actually far from that. Rather, it covers the bare essentials for getting started, such as picking the tools and utensils needed, as well as how to use them, and other details like that. The actual portion dedicated to the drawing is very basic and not in depth enough to assist in full blown drawing.Still, it is very informative in the areas it does cover, and is helpful for ""getting started"". Just keep in mind that it isn't the best choice for merely drawing Manga, but rather a helpful guide to show you what is needed to begin drawing Manga."
3,Its okay,"If ur just starting out and just want to draw the characters I dont suggest this book. It does not have alot on how to accually draw the characters but its shows the pro tools, tones, manga layout and stuff u should worry about when want to publish a manga. If ur starting out do not buy this book!!! I suggest How to draw manga by Kate Coope (publisher Tangerine press)"
2,Not really good for beginners,"This book is not really a manga getting started book. I don't feel that it explains enough for amateurs; it doesn't have a step by step or enough explanations. This book could maybe help some of those that already got through the amateur phase, but if you're really a beginner I wouldn't recomend it. (...)Maybe after you have mastered everything in these web pages you could buy it."
1,Waste of money.,"Please don't waste your money on this product. I saw an infomercial for Ouidad and since my daughter and I both have curly/wavy hair I tried it out. After a month of exclusive use of all of their products (monthly deep conditioner, shampoo, conditioner,moisturizing spray and gel) I see NO difference in our hair. When reading the ingredients for the shampoo you will see that it uses sulfates, no different than any store brand product and far more expensive. Not to mention the bottle is very small so it really lasts only a month. The only product I was satisfied with was the gel because it was rather light and not sticky. The moisturizing spray was okay as well, but not really worth the price."
1,Don't Be Fooled- Strips and dries hair and is loaded with chemicals.,"This product is not as advertised at all. As another reviewer pointed out, it is loaded with sulfates and no different from any drug store shampoo. Personally, I've found that this shampoo actually has a drying effect on my hair. That's why you need all the other products; the heavy conditioner plus the leave-in conditioner. The other products just coat the hair with silicones, again, the same as drug store products. I also found this product incredibly stripping- my colored hair was bright orange after two weeks (washing every other day) with this product."
1,Not for me,I am an African-American woman. I was hoping to find a product that would be easy for me to use so I wouldn't have to go to the hairdresser. It did not work. My hair did not curl much at all. It was frizzy and sticky.
3,Its Okay..,"I started using this line for 2 month but was only using the conditioner. Which is great.. but after using the shampoo for 2 weeks my hair is going wild, and its not soft and silky anymore. Im going to try it till its gone.. but so far the shampoo inst working well with my hair.Im kinda shocked because this line works so well with curly hair.. So maybe I need a different shampoo. But I will say If you curly crazy hair.. you should try the Line.. The conditioner works Great, my color came alive."
5,Happy,Item as described. Very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend this to other buyers. Shipped very fast. Nice earcuff.
1,"Good show, really awful version!!!!","Sony took a long, long time putting out this final season of a great show --- and this is the best they could do? First of all, it's a DVD-R, not even a proper DVD. And it wouldn't play in our regular DVD player --- it kept getting pixilated and wouldn't play. They put all of the episodes on one disc, which I'm sure didn't help. At least two discs for this, guys! Not to mention the fact that there is no, virtually NO information that came along with it and no extras. A long, long way down in quality from the first series set. Shame on you, Sony. This is so NOT worth the money!"
2,Booooooooo!,"Renewing the show then canceling it after 9 episodes then asking full season price. Are they crazy? And as a fan of the show owning this season is just wrong. They got rid of Jim Gaffigan, denied the actors playing PJ & Bobby jobs on real network tv, then bought in the fabulous Rachel Harris only to cancel it. To make matters worse this season's ""start"" really wasn't up to the previous seasons so again no reason to buy this. I knew this was the last season but what a crummy way to go out. I'm giving it 2 stars out of sentimentality it really only deserves 1."
3,"Wow, I can't believe I found it.","""The last song"" was one of my favorite 45's. I wore it out. I never knew anyone else that had heard it till 1999. Ronda and I where at a band practice, I was humming the tune and she asked me what song that was. When I told her Edward Bear The Last Song she said I can't believe you know that song. It was one of her favorites also. Sadly Ronda died in 2002, but as she waited for the Lord to take her home I sang this song to her. Thank you Edward Bear for one of the most memorial songs I've ever heard."
4,WOW!,"I've been looking off and on for Edward Bear for a couple of years now, and, although this is missing some of the songs that I had on 45s when I was too young to appreciate them, it's still an acceptable collection. Too bad they faded into obscurity, because I really thought their songwriting was amazing, and I can still listen to their stuff today, which is more than I can say for a lot of the bands out there."
4,"As Advertised, Could Be Brighter","These are nice looking bulbs in the Lowell Ego, and give off a near perfect daylight temperature. Plus they don't generate much heat at all. Very low amount compared to a tungsten or open face light.The drawback is it would be nicer if bulbs for the Ego were made and designed in the 40-50W range (equivalent to 175-200 watts in tungsten talk).A little pricey, but bulbs seem to last forever."
2,too many legs,"It seemed like most of the can was comprised of the less than edible rear hopper legs. The quality would be highly improved if these were removed, since they seemed to have fallen off inside the can anyway."
1,Bad cokbook for Moms,My Mom got this cookbook recently...unfortunately for me and Dad. The recipies she tried so far were either tasteless or full of bad tastes. Yuck! I don't think Mom cared much for them either because she stopped trying new recipies. Save your money and try a different cookbook.
1,No Phish recipes?,Bad book. I'm a big Phisherman and there are not enough Phish recipes. I guess that's because Mrs. Robinson already burnt enough Phish in her day. Don't Waste money on this book. You are better off getting and orange Julius. I fed most this stuff to my cat Poster and he began to Twist Around because it gave him a Rift in his stomach. I think he was Down with Diesease after that concoction.
1,Worst Food By Far!,"Bought this for my mother and she made a few of the recipes...title speaks for it self.Disgusting, hard to follow, bland, and poorly written/laid out."
5,GREAT!,"I have this cookbook and it is filled with great and easy recipes. I have made a few things thus far and they are all very tasty. There is no mention of fastfood in this book, not sure where those other reviews came from. Great cookbook! My family enjoys it."
5,The Haverfield Incident,"Excellant, Excellant Book, especially for former ""Deck Apes"". It is well written and one that you will not want to put down once you start it. I only regret that it had to end. I can relate to alot of the incidents having been in the Navy during this period of time"
5,"""Best Game"" according to my daughter","As soon as I installed the game on the computer, my daughter just loved playing all the games. It is a great game, but one thing is that you need to reset the graphics to 800 x 600 every time you need to play the game. I guess it must be an old version, but that is no major issue. Maybe they should update it with better graphics. Overall it is a great game."
4,A second opinion...,"Originally I had rated this dictionary at three stars. After getting beyond the surface of the Nelson I would rate it at four and a half. This book has so many characters and combinations that it is overwhelming. It also contains historical tables for shoguns, emperors, and cultural eras as well as a list of important kanji and what kanji Japanese children learn in school. It is truly an amazing tome.The only reason I would not give this dictionary a five out of five is because it doesn't have the names of the kanji translated into kana. Other than that this book is a must have for serious students of Japanese language."
2,"Irrationally ""Improved"" edition","The Classic Nelson, as noted below, was pretty sterling when it came to rapidly turning up a kanji. There's a vertical thumb index printed along the edge of the pages that works like animation when you flip the pages to find your radical. From a linguistic point of view, of course, the sooner you graduate from thinking in English about Japanese, to thinking in Japanese, the better off you are; however...! You'll need all the help you can get for a long time. So get Nelson. Any Nelson, but if possible, get the OLD Nelson, with the page-edge animation. If that's unavailable, you can also get computer assistance -- e.g., Sergey Kurkin's JEDict for Macintosh OS X 10.4 contains all the Kanji in Nelson with Nelson's own index numbers, and allows you to look up characters by dragging and dropping their parts into a list (among many other conveniences.) You should have a copy of Nelson, though. Don't leave English without it."
2,Disappointed Classic Nelson User,"I hate to pan a book to which so much effort has been given. But it's hard to fathom why the editors didn't realize the frustration that users of the so-called Classic edition would experience in using this new version. Is the J-E kanji dictionary market so large that they thought they would attract a whole new readership base, rather than long-time users simply seeking an upgrade?Since the book has been published electronic dictionaries have come to the fore. But I still use Nelson when reading a print newspaper -- a Classic edition I recently bought at a second-hand bookstore."
3,A rite of passage for students of the language.,"The Kanji dictionary by which others are judged. It's difficult to fault Nelson's for completeness. Their system of arranging the characters is baroque and difficult to learn, however. It's a sort of rite of passage into learning japanese to learn to use this book. Someday soon kanji dictionaries will be ubiquitous software and help you find your kanji in seconds. Until then, this mammoth tome sets the standards by which others are judged."
5,Best resource for Kanji Translation next to a native speaker!,"It's hard to believe that it's been almost 10 years since I graduated high school. But in my time there my fondest memories are of my Japanese Language class. My teacher had this book and I founbd it to be an invalubale reasorce!!! After graduation I contected her and asked her for the publisher's information. Thank you Mrs. ""I"". I've had it about 6 years now and I use it fairly regularly. On to the details... It contains over 1500 pages of information. I can't even offer a guess as to how many actual Kanji but I'd say it safely breaks the 15,000 mark. It's search feature is easy to use by searching for the radical of the kana. This combined with a decent Furigana dictionary (I have Kondansha's) make for outstanding pair to understand even complex text's. Obviously this takes time but it's the quickest way for now. At least until someone comes up with an iPhone or Android app for this :)"
4,A must-have classic,"If you are serious about studying Japanese you need this book. It's the gold standard of Japanese language scholarship in English. Even if you use smaller dictionaries or an online dictionary for day-to-day work, you need this in your reference shelf. It *is* old-fashioned, of course, but this latest update is very welcome."
1,The New Nelson,"The New Nelson, is still practical as the old one with thousand of characters more. It is the best tool on the market for every body using japanese language at the beginning-intermediate levels. In Italy, we don't have Japanese-Italian dictionary so we loved the old Nelson and now much more the new one."
5,Awesome!!!,"I love old gangster movies, and this is one collection that I am glad I bought! Very good classic films!"
5,TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Gangsters - James Cagney,Cheaper than at TCM (I checked). Came quickly. We have seen White Heat before; watched two tother already and they are really good. These movies are highly recommended.
4,James Cagney -- not much is better than him,"Brilliant, versatile and gifted, this collection includes most of sides of Cagney's talent -- I wish it had Yanikee Doodle Dandy though."
5,OFF DA HOOK!!!!,This is exactly what I was looking for and more! as soon as I saw Tony's name I knew it would be off da hook (as my kids would say) and it was! Wow this really brought back some memories. I had the music pumping and folks prob thought I had turned the place into NYC Club Shelter. This is a great pick for those of us who love club/house music. DJ's like Tony and Larry Levan are classic in creating NYC nightlife and this CD brought back some classic memories. You will definately enjoy!
1,This Stuff is Terrible,"This stuff tastes absolutely Terrible! Steer Clear and don't be mislead by the texture review below. Yup, the texture is great, but it the taste makes you gag it definately isn't worth it!"
5,"AAA+ OUTSTANDING QUALITY, TASTE, AND CONVENIENCE.","I am especially pleased with this Rice. I can't imagine how any food item could be more convenient to store or prepare. And, most importantly, it taste quit good. But taste is always very subjective. Another recent reviewer didn't like the taste, and I personally think that it's great.It's also worth mentioning that it was delivered in only 3 days. I placed my order Online on Monday night, and UPS actually delivered it into my hands on Thursday morning. - Highly recommended!"
1,Zelco Bookmark Dictionary,"Beware! The contrast between background and letters is very poor. This makes it difficult to read the words on the screen. I feel this is a manufacturing flaw. Please try to use one before purchasing. Company (Zelco) does not accept returns, even from their retailers."
1,Total and utter crap,So Sharon Osbourne is now promoting a runner up in the X Factor with a total and utter crap single. Chico Time goes to show how bad the music scene has gone now. I would avoid buying this at all cost. Its just a stupid song and aint worth the money.
3,"Not bad, but spend your money elsewhere","I have over 500 lounge/cocktail genre CDs, including this one. While this CD has some unique songs that I have not seen/heard on other mixes, it is nothing to get excited about. Sure, you can cherry-pick some of the better songs when making your own lounge mix CD, but the overall flow of this CD from beginning to end is lackluster. Take your money and get one of the Ultra Lounge ""Wild, Cool and Swingin'"" titles instead."
5,Great comedy!,A must have for any Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis fan. Many hours of fun and laughter from one of the greatest comedy duos of all times!
1,NOT SO GREAT,Was not as great as I thought. Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin are better in movies then this sidcom shows.
5,The other side of Madredeus,"Rodrigo Leo, amongst other adventures, has played with Madredeus for a long time. Somewhere along the way, he and accordeonist Gabriel Gomes left and, for me, the group lost a great deal of its magic ( although Gabriel is now back, on the group's latest album ). Although this is much more a classical music album than a pop one, if you get to buy it, you certainly will try to get the more recent ones. In Portugal, just a few weeks ago another one was published ( Alma Mater ) where, if you love the "" old times "" Madredeus, will find a soothing a reason to smile again."
2,Confused,So i just got this and it came really quickly which was really nice. But i am just so confused on how to use this. Registering it looks really simple but i guess i am doing it wrong. There are no instructions on anything and i do not know what is going on.
1,Compression settings seem to do nothing...,"The product works well enough, but no matter what the bit-rate setting is - the filesize comes out the same even though the product says its going to make a smaller file."
1,This company is no good to customers...if u have problems,"I purchased Xilisoft and the product works great. However, my system crashed and I had to reinstall products on my laptop. That was back in Novemeber 2009, when I looked at my online receipt it did not have the product registration code. They claim you can email them or enter your email address the information was sent too and retrieve the code. I've been emailing everyday for 2 months still not 1 reply back and when I enter the email I still receive nothing. No way, I'm going to pay for this product again."
1,Nightmare customer support,"I bought software and on disc. The disc didn't arrive, so I contacted the company. Short version: after three months, it hadn't arrived and I asked for a refund. They wouldn't give me a refund and, instead, offered me free downloads of several of their other products.I had numerous problems with the installation of the download version. After several emails to the company, the download version still wouldn't run. Still no refund. Still no copy in the box.I agree with the other reviews that this product has problems, especially there product support. And there response time was not very quick. I don't recommend this product."
1,Not a Good Tool for DVD ripping,I have used xilisoft-platinum to attempt to rip DVDs for PSP and iPAD. After hours upon hours of trial and error using the proposed formats supplied by Xilisoft and even creating custom user formats I have yet to successfully rip any of several DVD's where the audio-video actually syncs appropriately. Their on-line FAQ and other support is lacking. I strongly suggest saving your money and do not buy this product.
1,garbage,"Any thing good, said about this product was written by the officer of the company. All I got was audio and video garbage. This is the worst I have been burnt on a product."
4,Best for children over 6 years,"My daughter loves to draw and paint and really loves horses, so this product is a natural choice. It's large enough and heavy enough to stay upright while paint is being applied. It's also marked with suggested areas for different shades of paint. For best results, the child has to be patient enough to finish it in more than one sitting which is why I recommend it for children age 6 or older. It could also be a fun project for an adult."
1,Not what I hoped for.,"I was given book for Christmas present, and I was really excited about the concept. As I got deeper into the book however, I became more and more disappointed. The writing was flat and so were the characters. The plot was formulaic. Very disappointing overall."
1,More like 1/2 star,I wish I could say that I enjoyed this book. It seemed like it would be just up my alley. I enjoy reading all kinds of genre fiction and appreciate the creation of a heroine who isn't a size 2. Unfortunately the characters seemed wooden and the whole book very predictable. I doubt I would read this author again.
2,Too Bulky and too much counter space,The carousel works great but it takes up too much counter space for my taste. I have replaced it already with a new one that only has two sides and holds more K cups.
2,Flimsy and fragile,"Received my carousel today. Even though the box was packed carefully inside another box with airpacks all around, four of the ring were broken off and lying in the bottom of the box. As I placed it on the counter, another ring came off in my hand. This thing is made of cheap metal and the rings are tack-welded at an odd angle to another larger ring. I cannot see how it could possibly survive normal use. If I had submitted this design in my mechanical engineering class back in college, I would have failed miserably. Good idea, poorly executed."
2,Flimsy design,"My carousel arrived with one ring broken off. Another came off in my hand as I took it out of the box. These rings are welded on to a much firmer center ring with a narrow connection. I am returning it to get one of the plastic 2-sided models. I like the look of this one better, but it's not worth the risk of more broken rings in the future."
4,keurig carousel,This carousel is a space saver. It eliminated all the boxes and makes it easy to find my favorite flavers.
3,Not as pictured,The Keurig cups only fit half way into the holders on the carousel which is a bit of a bummer because it takes up a little more room on my kitchen counter. The product picture shows cups fitting completely into holders.
2,Good coffee,Quite a good selection although price is on the high side. Order arrived on time but could buy same product in local maeket for cheaper. Suggest reconsider price
2,Good Concept/Faulty Craftmanship,"I just bought my Kuerig B60 and am an absolute fan of the coffee maker and when I was shopping around, I found the carousel a charming accompaniment. But, when it arrived, about a third of the ringlets which hold the K-cups had broken off and the remaining ones were hanging on by a thread. I was really disappointed, because I had such high hopes for this item, but in all honesty. It is not very solid or well made. Mind you the shipping might of had a portion to do with the damage, but upon inspection. I found the welds to be not so sturdy. It's up to you if anyone wishes to purchase it, but I just thought I would tell you my opinion on the product I myself received. Hope this helps. :)"
3,"Damaged Box, dirty item inside","I thought I was purchasing a new item, as it said it was new in the box. The item was dirty, and I had to clean it off. The box was also damaged."
5,Awesome,Super idiot proof. It would go with pretty much any kitchen decor because it is really neutral and it isn't too big.
4,A worthwhile purchase,"Looks good on the counter, and makes it easy to find the coffee as well. Makes a slight scraping sound when you turn it (probably not sitting on ball bearings), but it turns easily enough."
2,Not all that sturdy,I was loving this UNTIL one of the rings just FELL off. Oh dear. I got it for Christmas and you'd think it would last longer than that. I got some epoxy glue and got it back on but it was pretty annoying to have to do that.
3,mediocre at best,"When I received the carousel, a number of the loops designed to hold the k-cups were bent inward, to the point that it caused spacing issues between adjacent cups. I attempted to gently bend one of the loops into proper position, and it snapped off with very little pressure applied! Needless to say, I left the remainder of the bent loops where they were. Now whenever I refill it, a few of the bottom slots have alignment issues."
3,KEURING CAROUSEL REVIEW,The item is very handy but when it arrived four of the little holders were broken off. It wasn't worth the effort of packing the whole thing back up and sending it back so we decided to just keep it.
5,Keep a clean kitchen counter-top,This is a great way to keep your coffee organized and your kitchen counter-top clean. It's like having your own coffee store in your kitchen!
4,Great little cup holder,We love our K-cup holder. It is just the right size to hold a great selection of teas and coffees without taking up all my counter space. Love the style and appearance even when it is not in use. This product is well made and we recommend it to anyone who uses the K-cup system.
1,Keurig K-cup Carousel (sold by Vandue),"I ordered a Keurig K-cup Carousel from Vandue I was looking forward to getting it! I've wanted one for awhile! When I opened the box it was damaged, 2 of the rings were snapped off. It was in a small plastic bag with nothing to protect it, no bubble wrap or anything ...I was surprised, however I do not think this was made by Keurig! It is cheap and you can clearly see it! Not happy with this item or the seller! I must say it did arrive fast, I placed the order Friday evening and I received it Wednesday."
5,"Excellent product, less $$ than on the manufacturers website.",Everyone in the house loves this product. It makes the coffee more accessible. I'm very happy with this product because it saved me a significant amount of money versus buying it from the Keurig website. Love it!
1,Broken,"Arrived TWICE with broken K-Cup Holder Rings. Not happy at all. Looks nice, but the design doesn't hold up well. Poor packaging and poor attachment of the rings on K-Cups part. Amazon was terriffic with the returns & refunds!!! Do NOT reccommend buying!"
1,Cheaply Made,"I received mine with 2 broken rings. If you dig deeper into the reviews you'll notice several people had the same problem. It's a wonderful concept, but has flimsy construction. Save your money."
1,dissapointed,"I ordered a Keurig 5060 K-cup Carousel sold by Amazon, and it arrived to me broken. One of the cup holder rings were snapped off. The way it was packaged must not have not protected the carosel from being damaged through transpotation."
4,Great for selecting!,Mine came in great shape and spins easily. It does not fly around - who wants it to? I am happy with this purchase.
2,Could Be Better,"While I certainly did not expect a precision mechanism when I ordered this carousel, I am a bit disappointed. It revolves roughly as though reluctant to do so. It seems as if the manufacturers could have come up with something a bit smoother."
2,Dumb,"This is a dumb idea. It takes up valuable counter space, you have to keep refilling it, when it is half empty it looks ridiculous. If you or your guests drink more than one cup each, it looks like a defragmented tree. Plus it is chrome PLATED... not even stainless steel. Yuck."
3,Does what it's supposed to.,It does what it's supposed to do. I only give it 3 stars because the prices for this thing is absurd. It's only a K cup holder and nothing more. Anything over 10 bucks is outlandish!
1,Poorly constructed,"One of the rings broke on day 1. My wife wanted this instead of the bulkier version that I have at my office. It is very cheaply made, should be $9.99, it is nowhere near as good at the double sided version."
3,Functional but...,"Carousel does what it is intended to which is display k-cups but it does not spin as freely as you might expect. As some others have said the construction is not exceptional. For the price, its not a great value but its better than fumbling through boxes to find the k-cup you want. This should be at least $5 cheaper."
5,Must have if you're a single-cup fan,"These are great -- I bought two of them, especially great to roll out during a gatherings. Gotta go with the chrome ones, not the plastic tower-types, those look cheesy."
4,Great way to keep track of flavors,"This little gadget makes it easy to see different flavors, and keeps counter cluttter at a minimum. It's very well made, spins smoothly and is attractive."
3,It's Just A Rack - But A Decent Rack,"If you are like me you bought the Keurig coffee maker and you want to keep the various coffees next to it without your countertop looking awful. This rack does the job - a nice carousel that will clean up your countertop. However, it is very overpriced for what it is - and it is suprising that someone has not come out with a better more cost efficient option."
5,K-cup carousel,"This is a really nice carousel. I would have liked it to be taller because I have a lot of K-cups. I will probably have to buy another, but have no complaints about this as far as being sturdy; it turns around nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space. I haven't seen one any taller, but if they come out with a taller one like this, I will purchase it."
2,Be careful it is delicate,I just received a couple days ago and I already have a problem. The rings are spot welded and apparently suspect to breaking off too easily as one of mine just broke off. I am the only person using this item in the house so I know it was not misused. I have not contacted Amazon yet and have never had to for an products purchased from them so this will be my first experience doing so. For $10.00 more I might just try the other type of design that has two sides back to back instead of this carousel style.
5,Very Nice K cup carousel,"I really like my Keurig coffee maker, but didn't like having the K-cups piled in a bowl next to it. The bowl took up too much space on my limited counter. This carousel is great, well made and so compact, looks very nice too. Spins well, and seems very well made to me. I do think it could actually have one more ""tier"" since there is plenty of room between the top of it, and the bottom of my cabinet. It looks great and is a nice accessory to my coffee maker."
4,"Keurig 5060 27-Cup-Capacity K-Cup Spinning Carousel, Chrome",This item is a wonderful addition to our Keurig coffee maker and looks very nice at our coffee station in the kitchen. We find it very convenient to whip up a cup of coffee whenever we want.
1,It'll only last as long as your Keurig.,"I bought a top-of-the-line Keurig unit. It quit working properly within the first month after the 1 year warranty. I was unhappy with the only answer I could get from Keurig Customer Service to continue dumping vinegar through the unit.I suppose I could rate the carousel five stars since it does it's job perfectly, but when the coffee maker quit, the accessory also became junk, too. Think twice before buying all sorts of accessories for a Keurig."
4,Keeps K cups orginazed,I have K cup carousel and l like it. Got one for my friend when i got her a keurig coffee machine. It works great and looks good. Keeps the k-cup packets orginazied and easly accesseble..
4,keep it clean,We bought this coffee maker as an auxilliary coffee maker and the little cups were cluttering up the bar sink! This cute little thingie makes it much neater and offer us a quick selection!
3,Does the job...,"I purchased this after scouring the internet for a price (incl shipping) that I could bear to pay for this little item. It does the job & makes the kcups easier to access than leaving them in the box. Also - much takes much less storage space. The item came promptly - but one of the rings WAS broken off. They were nice enough to leave it in the box tho -- so I'll cold solder it back into place.Why these things are expensive is a mystery. They are fairly cheap .... but, that said, I highly recommend having a k-cup holder if you use them."
5,"Easily holds 31 K-cups, not just the 27 it claims! Excellent product!","This looks and works just as expected -- with the UNexpected bonus of a space at the top where you can easily fit 2 more K-cups if you want them sitting totally flush (visible only when looking down on it, not from the side), or 4 more if you don't mind them standing up, creating the look of a 4th tier. To me it's worth the extra height to hold 4 more, and it doesn't take away from the aesthetic appeal in my opinion. By the way, Amazon's price is the same as virtually everywhere, online and off -- including the Bed Bath and Beyond brick and mortar store, where you can always use a coupon (I used a $5 off coupon for each of the two I purchased)."
2,broken,"When item was received, two of rings where broken. It appears it was broken before it was packaged. When received, both rings were set on top of the stand and bubble wraped in."
4,Great Accessory,"I like this product. It is nice to have a place to put an assortment of K-cups so that anyone can quickly find something they like. I wish it was larger, but other than that, it is great! I keep it on the counter next to my Keurig; it doesn't take up much room but keeps the k-cups organized!"
5,Wonderful Space Saver,This is wonderful and takes up much less space than putting the cups on a tray for guests to choose. Turns perfectly and quietly and is very smart looking also.
4,Make life easier,"I like it, I wish it had more spaces to store more cups, but even the size it is, it is good. It is worth every cent of the price I paid"
3,Nice But Be Careful!,"I purchased this product from Amazon.com instead of the carousel that is available at QVC - that one was too tall for my counter space. When I received this carousel from Amazon, I thought it was fantastic - at first - until one of the round, metal k-cup circle holders fell off. These metal holders could be attached on ALOT better. So...just be careful and DO NOT bend these holders or they will break right off. Also, when you receive yours, be sure to check each holder to make sure one is not ready to fall off like mine.I wanted a replacement from Amazon but they told me they were no longer in stock which is strange because they still show up as available on their website. Oh, well...I still wanted this one so I had to go buy it at Bed, Bath & Beyond."
2,Broken on arrival,"The idea for this carousel is great but mine arrived broken,(one of the rings were in the bottom of the box). Since there was no damage at all to the outside of either of the boxes, I can only assume that it was put in the box that way! After I ordered mine, I read the reviews and was hoping that mine would not arrive broken. I am just glad it was for me and not a gift."
4,Keurig K-Cup Carousel,"Great product. Nice way to store my K-Cups and have them conveniently at hand. I got two of them - one arrived slightly bent, but I feel this was a shipping issue, not a manufacturer issue."
4,great concept spinning carousel,This is a very good space saver and is a very sturdy constuction. Easy for the children to reach thier cocoa flavor and holds a lot.very good product
1,Breaks easily,"I bought this in an actual store and thought I would share my experience as it relates to this same item. I opened the box and pulled it out and heard a loud clanging of metal on the floor, and noticed one of the rings had already broke. When I took the item back the lady asked me if the rings fell off and I said yes and asked if that was a common problem. She told me every single one that has been returned has had the same problem. I am going to order the other one that is not made out of metal rings."
3,CHRISTMAS SHIPPING,"BE CAREFUL. UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEM MAKES YOU GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS INCLUDING ENTERING YOUR CREDIT CARD NO. BEFORE SHOWING YOU THE SHIPPING & HANDLING. I ORDERED ON EOF THESE FROM OrganizeIt TODAY, AND THEY WANTED ABOUT $35 FOR S&H. I ROLLED THE DICE ON THE REGULAR SHIPPING (ABOUT $8) AND AM CROSSING MY FINGERS. JUST WANTED TO WARN PEOPLE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS TO FIGURE IT OUT LIKE I DID..."
1,Looks aren't everything,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this product. Not only did I receive it in a broken condition, one of the rings was loose in the box, but the welds holding the rings all seemed to be questionable."
2,Not the best,The product arrived damaged. The carousel itself was tilted and the K-Cup holders were smashed in. It doesn't rotate very well.
2,Very Poor Quality,"Received this product in very poor condition! Had to remove base, tighten screws holding upper assembly, and reassemble. I would have returned it for a replacement, but I didn't want to bother with packing and shipping."
3,"Not well made, but it functions","When it arrived the handle/stem was bent at a 20 degree angle. It bent back by hand close to straight. The base does turn, but there is more resistance than necessary. This could have been caused by the bent handle to begin with. I just pick the whole rack up now and rotate it with my wrist. With all that said, it is practical and it looks nice."
5,Looks great on the counter and is fun to use!,"We have this Carousel and we also have the other one that is two-sided. They sit side by side and I prefer this one. The K-cups do not fall out of it like they do the other one and you can even put 2 extra K-Cups on the very top in the openings.It looks very nice sitting on the counter and if anything, I just wish it was a bit taller so it could hold more K-cups!"
5,"Sleek, sturdy, useful carousel","I bought this carousel for my parents after I bought them a Keurig coffeemaker. The carousel is sturdy and made of a sleek, high-quality, silvertone metal. It turns smoothly without wobbling from side to side. It doesn't take up much counter place and is an attractive way to showcase different flavors of k-cup coffees, teas, and cocoas. Really a great product at a great price."
4,Counter Top Flair!,"Kinda hard to skrew a product like this up!! It's basically a chrome plated carousel that holds the k-cups. Looks great on the counter, next to the machine. Recommended if you really have lots of varities. I would've given it 5 stars if it would spin more freely, with less effort."
5,AWESOME HOLDER,Just opened my carousel yesterday and it looks great and holds a lot of k-cups. My Keurig came with so many k-cups I also am using the stainless steel slide out tray which I'm glad I had. I like organization and this is perfect.
5,Works perfectly,The 27-cup Spinning Carousel in the perfect way to organize the K-cups for easy display and access. It works perfectly!
4,Donna from California,The carousel is great - looks good on the counter and makes it easy to display and choose from our variety of Kcups.
2,Could not finish it,"I am a huge fan of chick lit.However, I could not even get through this one. Main character Molly decides to get pregnant. Guy she is with does not want it (big surprise there). From one second to the next Molly morphs into this ""SUPERMOM"" and frankly it was unbelievable and silly.I did not get into the storyline at all and felt as though the story dragged and dragged (which is unusual for Brit lit).Could not even finish this one. Skip it."
1,Sorry that I spent my Gift Certificate on it.,"I recieved a Amazon/UK gift certificate for my birthday and one of the book that I got was ""Baby on Board"" by Stephanie Zia, and I am sorry that the wasted it on this book!Molly Warren is a late thirty something who has spent the last six years with a married man. Realizing that her clock is running down, she get pregnant. Well, almost over night her world changes. Gone is her London flat, jetting around the world to a life in Kew spending time with postnatal group. Molly is a character that does not grow at all during the book. The only difference is now is that she has a baby.Do yourself a favor and just skip this book."
1,Disappointing...,"The trailer for this movie was beautiful. But the movie left me wanting. To me, it was unrealistic and just didn't flow right. The scenes, as beautiful as they are, were too drawn out, and somewhat ackward. This had such potential, but fell short. :("
4,Bagkok as usual,"Depicting Bangkok as a place youth doing living with crime and prostitution, authors introduced a reviewer to a call-killer and his lover-an officer supposed to be kidnapped and then murdered.Too much of melodrama, too much of topics touched, too dark ending and rather general topic than exhibited make this work suitable for a general drama-hungry audience."
4,My Review,I saw this movie on a internet site on my laptop and I liked how the movie was done. I hope you will like this movie as much as I did.
5,Bangkok Love Story,"Bought from Amazon...recieved movie with days. I love this movie. Beautiful love story...taking place in beautiful Thailand. Beautiful scenes, good looking Thai actors, great performances, poignant love scenes, lots of adventure...and some violence...but, on the whole, this movie is a classic."
4,Bangkok love story,"Love story? Indeed it is.Good acting, human relations not sexwhich is seldom for a flic like this.Enjoyed it cause it really is differentW.J."
4,Paul Westerberg plays one.,"50 bucks for a $200 guitar is quite a bargain. Paul Westerberg plays (or at least) played one of these he picked up at Wal-Mart. Guitar Player gave it a good review recently. Mine just came. It sounds good and looks cool. The fit and finish isn't perfect, but more than good enough for a $200 guitar."
1,DID NOT WORK OR SOUND GOOD,"I told my Mom I wanted a real guitar, she bought me this one, and I was so upset, it sounded and played horrible. I made her return this and get me the xbox."
2,not realistic for active/high needs baby,"I have a very active son. He likes to be held all the time and move around a lot. I'm a 500-hr registered yoga teacher and I love Shiva Rea. I tried going to mommy-and-me yoga but my son's schedule was too unpredictable. Thought this would be fun but it doesn't incorporate the baby enough. Best to just do regular yoga and use your instincts. When my baby was under 6 months I would do warrior poses holding him and even use a carrier. Or just put him in a play pen near you. Or wait til baby is sleep. My baby loves to lay on his back while I do push-up over him or down dog, but you have to have the arm strength for that. Corpse pose just doesn't work with a little one. I can sit down and nurse tho."
3,Good thought,Good in theory but baby is probably better to work with before they are moving a whole lot.Good video though for yourself.
3,Good but not what i really wanted,I like the dvd but I was wanted something that had more mom and baby moves other then just touching.It is not the worst one I have seen but i figured it would have stuff for bigger kids and mom.
2,not as pictured,The picture is misleading! I thought it was all of the colors (probably my fault for not reading careful) looks like it will work well
1,makes my hair greasy and results in breakouts,I purchased this shampoo and conditioner do to all the great reviews I saw on it. Though is is quite expensive if it worked I thought it would be well worth the money. I have long coarse dry wavy to curly hair and have had issues with not getting enough moisture to stay in in my hair especially in the summer. I used this shampoo and conditioner together and later separately thinking the issue could be that it was moisturizing too much either way it resulted in me having greasy hair by the second day and I eventually started having breakouts on my neck shoulders and back were my hair hits on my body. If you are going to try it get the smaller bottle or a sample so you are not throwing your money away like i did.
3,Not brilliant,This wasn't the worst conditioner for my curls but for the price I was expecting my hair to have less frizz
2,"Great at first, greasy in the end","I loved this condition when I first tried it. I used it whether my hair was going to be straight or curly that day. No frizz, great curls, tangle free. I used a whole bottle and ordered another... then my hair started getting disgustingly greasy. I thought it must be the shampoo, since I've been using the same conditioner for so long without problem. (I did, at one point, use the matching shampoo for this product and didn't like it). I tried changing my shampoo over and over and nothing helped. Finally I tried a different conditioner and my hair eventually went back to normal. I don't understand why it took so long to start getting greasy but I will never use this again."
4,What a Guy,"Will Rogers seemed like a really interesting person, but like many people today I knew almost nothing about him.Will Rogers was the first king of all media and he seems like he was a really decent guy. Ben Yagoda does a great job of bringing Will Rogers to life. His prose is extremely readable and Will Rogers gave him a lot of material to work with."
2,Variable Steam? No Steam!,Takes forever to get hot than once it's hot there is little to no steam. The buttons are mere decorations because I press them and nothing happens. I would have returned it but my dog thought the box was a new chewing toy and demolished it. Now I'm stuck with a iron that barely works. Plan on buying another one as soon as I can.
1,"Don't buy these from Amazon, the irons are defective.","Normally, I like this iron. I've had two that lasted a few years each. They do break by year 3 or 4. So I ordered a new one from Amazon. The first one I received had several jagged scratches on the non-stick soleplate--the kind of scratches that could scratch delicate blouses. I sent it back for a replacement and received a second one today. The one I got today in replacement also has scratches on the soleplate, less jagged, thinner longer ones. I'm starting to think these items are returns sold to Amazon or Amazon customers scratched and returned them. Either way, big disappointment since its such a hassle to return items. The main purpose of an iron is a surface that doesn't damage the clothes being ironed. I won't be buying irons online again if I can't verify the plate is scratch-free."
3,OK...nothing phenomenal,I read other reviews and was expecting something better. Nevertheless it is adequate for the purpose.
3,its hot,it's hot and that is about it.this irn has no auto shut off why does the light go on and why does it go off - after it is plugged in (which is the on/off)it does have a non-stick surface but without the auto shut off it can still scorch your clothesit is light I only got it because it was so cheapnext time I will spring for a few more bucks to get the auto shut off and better control
2,Cheap and emiting bad odor,"This one feels very cheap and bad manufactured in hand, and it emits bad odor when unpackaging. Not good. Other products of similar price shouldn't be this bad."
1,lead warning,Purchased B&D steam iron from local retailer. Did not notice warning on bottom of box until we got home. Warning on bottom states that power cord contains lead. Recommends washing hands after using. How did this product get into the country??????
3,good,It gets hot fast but even when it was brand new the steam sputters and blotches water on the item you are ironing and it also leaks water out if you set it down flat for any length of time so I have to drain the unused water or do not lay it down flat only set it upright when water is in it.
1,Piece of junk. Had to buy another iron (panasonic NI-E300TR) which we love.,This iron is a piece of junk. had to buy another iron (panasonic NI-E300TR) which we love. that's it. - tony
1,Not any good,"This is a terrible ironI love to iron and iron everything I wearNow I have to buy another ironThis one doesn""t even iron simple fabricsNever gets hot enough and water leaksSO VERY DISAPPOINTED"
4,Good for the price,"It's not the best iron, but it works well. It has a rotary heat setting selector just below the handle. My gripe with it is that it clicks very loudly. When I iron in the morning i'm always afriad that i'll wake up my girlfriend and i'm sure that I have with this iron. Otherwise it was a good intermediate purchase. This should do good for a yearor so before I upgrade to a better one. The i'll use this as a spare."
2,A spray iron: sprays water instead of steam,"Maybe this is what you get for 17 $. An iron with a non stick sole which is rough like sand, a temperature control which you should not turn to the maximum value in order not to ruin your clothes and (the highlight) an adjustable steam valve which gives you the choice of either having no steam or a mixture of water and steam spraying out of it. Nevertheless I rate it 2 stars because you definitly can iron with it."
3,Perfect for small things.,"I got this mainly for the reason of ironing my pants for work, nothing else. And it's great for that purpose. Other wise, it's nothing to write home about."
1,Awful iron,"This iron is awful. It is near impossible to get water into the water opening. This is not an exaggeration- I spent 10 minutes trying to get water in and it after 10 minutes, the tank wasn't even 1/10th full. The water just sits on the top and doesn't go down.Luckily, I only spent $5 on this iron and use it as a backup for when my other crappy Black & Decker iron breaks (which occurs on a yearly basis- fortunately, they've been replacing them under warranty)."
3,"Good iron,but","there is no auto shut-off,there is no off/on control at all,just unplug or plug in.On positive side makes great steam and does have non-stick soleplate.The fabric select dial is very difficult to turn.I got it for my sewing room,it takes care of my needs there,didn't pay much for it,so guess I got what I paid for.(Friday Sale 9.99)"
5,Best value for an iron,I'm impressed with this iron because the price is so reasonable and the product is reliable. It's easy to spend more money on something that may seem to be better because of it's BRAND name but why pay more when this iron is just as good or better. I will definatley buy another Black & Decker iron.
1,Not worth the money,"Very poor quality. Unless you rarely use an iron, not recommended. Sputters and spits. Stains cloths. Poor job."
1,Disappointed,"I recently (November '07) purchased a Black and Decker Light 'N Easy iron. I have been so disappointed. It sticks to my clothing when I iron, on any heat setting. I can't do anything to help me iron my clothes without it sticking, like ironing on wax paper. Nothing helps. It does not steam properly. Neither does it heat evenly. And I do not have my warrenty anymore, or I'd take it back to Walmart pronto! This has taught me a lesson."
3,An okay iron with some annoying problems,The irons does an okay job but it has problems. It's hard to get water into it becasue the holes at the top are too small. The steam is great but lasts only a few minutes because the water runs out way too soon. Sometimes if I'm not careful water from the top drips out onto my clothing.
5,Works well,This iron gets hot fast and steam function works well. I have had no issues. I would say its worth the money. My husbands work clothes are perfectly creased!
5,Shipping and transit,"Order Placed:October 19, 2010View Order Details | View InvoiceOrder Number: 002-1935086-5264251Shipping Speed: Two-Day ShippingI HAVE ORDERED ITEMS FROM AMAZON.COM, IT SEEMS TO TAKE A LONG TIMEI WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE 2 DAY SHIPPING. I ORDERED THE IRON TUESDAY EVENING AND IT ARRIVED THURSDAY. THANKS A LOT, FOR THE FAST SERVICE THIS TIME."
1,DVD doesn't play!,I ordered this DVD and found it didn't play in any of my devices. I returned it and received a replacement that was also defective. I returned that and am now waiting for a refund.
3,I found it difficult to read,"To be fair, this book was required for a class I was taking on religious pluralism. Meaning, I didn't buy the book because it peeked my interest. Although this book gave some very detailed information about world missions, I found it hard to read. In my opinion, there were many grammatical issues, not to mention five chapters on the history of world missions. I like history, but apparently this wasn't interesting to me. As of the writing of this review, I have read 12 of the 25 chapter, the rest I scanned. Frankly, had it not been required for a class, I would not have read past the third chapter. I do intent to someday finish this book, but for now, I have other books to complete for other classes."
2,what in the world was the author thinking?,"Great content. Great message. Poorly written. It was required for me to read at school. If it hadn't been required, I would not have finished it."
4,Sonic Advance 3...Sonic Heroes Engine,"I personally cannot wait until this game comes out, I have been seeing tons and tons of articles saying that with the success that the Sonic Heroes engine had on GCN, they are going to try it out on the GBA. I have never played Sonic Advance 1 or 2, but I have played the older Genesis and the new GCN ones, but this is goiong to be a classic if it uses the same engine as Sonic Heroes. June 18 is too long to wait!"
4,worst sonic game ever,it has the same places kind of. really boring extrmely esy. but the GREAT thing is that u can play using two characters. I recomend this game to smaller kids under 12. but i think it will be great for older kids. i beat it in 2 days.:)
2,Its okay but not great.,If youre looking for a great sequel this is not it and after the disaster that was Sonic Heroes it is clear that the Sonic series is going downhill.But what would you expect?There have been several Sonic games before these 2 mediocre pieces of crap so they probably ran out of ideas.If youre looking for a great game just wait until F Zero GP Legend and Star Fox 2 come out.Pass on this.
4,Good Game,"I gave this game 4 stars because...Good: Classic Sonic ActionCrisp, Colorful GraphicsGood Controls (but what sidescroller doesn't?)Bad: Game is too easyLevel design can sometimes get tediousLittle InovationThis is an addictive little game but no Super Mario Bros. 3. I think that if you are accustomed to action games you will quite like this but do not expect anything new or innovative. I hope you will enjoy your game!"
3,Fun but not that fun.,"Sure, running through a level at top speed is super fun but you don't really get to do that when enemies are cleverly placed so you always hit them ruining the fun.The 2 character team was a nice idea but it'd be better if it was optional. Don't get me wrong I was as psyched as the next Sonic fan was for this game but came out disappointed. I took my cousin to the store soon after I got my last paycheck in 2004 to get 2 copies so we could have the experience together. And although playing with a real player is much more entertaining this game could've been much more.Nice musicNice graphicsGameplay is alrightSense of speed is nice (when you get a chance to keep it for a bit)Choice of characters is decentNow I don't hate the game but man I went out and spent 60 bucks! Not worth it at all. Buy them used if you have to! ^_^"
4,It's bad!,"I find this game intresting. You have to play as 2 characters. That's pretty neat you can do that,but this game is all about speed (literaly). There's almost no jumping,attacking or team work. If you don't like challenges,then this is the game for you."
4,One of Jose's finest albums,"Jose Feliciano's 1969 live recording at the London Palladium is one of his fans' most treasured albums. The 2 CD set captures the electricity of Jose's performances as he sings his standard hit songs, including ""Hi-Heel Sneakers"", ""Rain"", ""California Dreamin'"" and of course, ""Light My Fire"". There are also nice songs that Jose sings in Spanish, especially ""El Jenete"", and his own instrumental version of Ernesto Lecuona's ""Malaguena"". However, the highlight may be Jose's encore, the dramatic ""La Entrada de Bilbao"", on which he similates the playing of drums as the battle ends. The main drawback is Jose's comedy bit, a segment that just falls flat and detracts from an otherwise bravo performance."
1,Horrible and moldy,"This was the worst jerky I have every had in my life. The first package was okay, but the next couple of packages tasted a little 'off', almost stale. How can jerky taste stale? Well, apparently it can if it gets moldy.Now, I have eaten a lot of jerky in my life. I've made jerky. Properly prepared, jerky should not get moldy. I have never, ever had turkey jerky get moldy in an unopened package. But we found mold on the next package we opened, and by the time we got to the next one, it was covered in mold. These were stored in a dark, cool, dry place. We ended up throwing away the rest.I am glad that neither my family nor I got food poisoning from this stuff. Do not buy!"
1,All with mold - not eatable....,I usually love this product - and I have subscription for it. But this time it came all with mold! Just awful smell and look! Not sure what's going on - I think I have to end the subscription - it's not a cheap product.... Very disappointed.... :(
3,Delicious - hey wait a minute.,"Our household is addicted to this stuff. It's a little pricey, but when you break it down to the delicious, fulfilling, low-calorie, high-protein nutrition you get, it's worth it. At least to us. We finally got on the regular shipment plan to save 15% per month. Yay, Amazon.[Time passes]Hmmmm... I am starting to suspect there are two versions of this product. One you buy in the health food store and pay top dollar for... and this one. I have never had an issue with quality control with this product before. However, with this multi-pack I am finding that in every pouch there are a couple/few pieces that should have not made it past inspection - cut too thick to eat without soaking and/or too grisely to consider worthy of this price.So, hopefully it was just a few bag bags and maybe that's been straightened out. But I hope this is not the new version. We really do love this stuff- the high quality product we are used to, not the thick, grisely version."
4,Tastes pretty good.,"These jerkys are pretty good and flavorful. My daughter loves them and eats them instead of candy or high carbohydrate snacks but they can get pricy. It is not cheap and it is also a bit too sweet for me but its salt or sugar that preserves them naturally.I do like all natural meats without any presevatives such as Nitrate, Nitrite or TBHQ, too much of these ingested can lead to cancer."
2,Dissatisfied,I have ordered this product several times in the past and found it to be good. This last shipment was lacking in flavor and was greasy. After eating the jerky my hands were also greasy. This is a major quality reduction. I doubt I will order it again. Too bad as ordering online is so convenient.
4,Soft and tasty but a little salty,"Turkey jerky is delicious because it's much softer than beef jerky. It's very more-ish, as the english say."
1,Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky (Barbeque Flavor),This was not that great. I only tried this brand's Barbeque flavor so I don't know what the rest tastes like (to be fair). I will not be buying this again. I have tried several brands and so far the best one is Perky Jerky Turkey Jerky. Someone complained about Jack Links being too salty but I rather that than this bad tasting barbeque junk.
2,Sugar in the Jerky,"Short and Sweet: this jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky. In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates. For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.I notice that in the more ""natural"" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar. Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet. But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware."
2,Too Sweet,I ordered this because it was natural and nitrate free. I just received my shipment - it is very tender as others have said but I found it much too sweet for my taste. The sugar overpowers the pepper flavor and is not what I expected. If you want something that is more sweet than peppery or spicy you will like this brand.
3,golden valley turkey jerky,"I have always been very pleased with this product and have purchased it monthly for a very long time. However, the product I received last month should have been called ""turkey BURGER jerky"". It was very granular and difficult to eat. We take this in our lunches, and it is very inconvenient. Hopefully, it will improve, or I will have to find another option."
5,Tasty and natural,"I really enjoy this brand on Jerky. It doesn't have the processed, weird taste that many of the larger brands do. I do wish someone would make jerky that doesn't have soy sauce in it... as that contains wheat so some folks can't eat it.... it seems wheat really shouldn't be needed in jerky...no?"
1,The Worst I've Ever Eaten,"I started a low carb. diet and have been trying different brands of turkey jerky. Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky ""BLACK PEPPER"" was by far the worst I have ever tasted. I've never left a review about any product I've purchased, good or bad, but I had to say something about this. It literally tasted like candied meat. It has 6 grams of carbs per serving (all from sugar)....double that of any other I've found. Why would any company put so much sugar in a turkey jerky labeled black pepper? They should have just called it brown sugar turkey jerky. I threw it in the trash and got a refund from Amazon. Amazon truly is an incredible company and I will continue to make purchases via their venue, but this turkey jerky......?"
2,a natural jerky but lacking,"This turkey jerky is good in the fact that it is preservative-free, no MSG, no nitrates and all-natural. But, I was disappointed - it's too dry and difficult to eat. Not a great pleasure to the mouth, but okay in general."
4,GoodResource for the Man Who Knows Nothing,"""The Unix Bible"" might be overstating the case a little. One tends to think about ""bibles"" as definitive sources of information on a given subject (but now that I think of it, that can't be true. Other wise, ""The Holy Bible"" would be the definitive source of all things Holy and people are still fighting over what should be included in it).Nonetheless, this is an ideal resource for beginners who don't know one flavor of Unix from another. It's an easy read, a decent overview and will fill your head with enopugh Unix data to fake an interview."
2,"""I can't really recomend it""","This review was dictated by my 8 year old. He says:""I liked how it could transform so that it could be able to perform pop wheelies. But now that I have had it for awhile it will not morph all the way until I crash it, and I have no idea why. I liked how fast it could go, until it would use the batteries so fast that I could only get two minutes out of it.""OK, me again. We beat the tar out of this car. As you heard from my son, it quit transforming after one too many crashes. The windshield and side panel are cracked to bits, and now it won't really transform at all. But it still goes, and I'd call that good value for the beating it's taken. We're not exactly satisfied, but we've had some fun with it."
4,I love it!!,"I never knew how to play the paino but you don't need to know. It teaches you how to play songs. You can put a few of our favorite songs or play a few that are on the keyboard. I would recommend people get it, I love mine and cant stay off it :)"
5,fun stuff,"What a fun idea for a book! I love the comedic tour through various jobs, some of which I have held (and in the same area, since I graduated from the same University, albeit a decade or so later.) Classic Ayun Halliday style is applied to her adventures through the world of the classic jobs of youth. Humor, honesty, candor, fun, rollicking storytelling; all that you'd expect from this author."
5,Because you hate Mondays too,"Reading Ayun Halliday's books is a lot like listening to a story being told to you by your best friend. Her writing style is easy to follow and spares nothing to give you the story just as if she were saying it directly to you. Job Hopper is something with which everyone can identify. Ayun owns up to her flaws and tells the whole thing without sparing even the grimiest of details. This way, you are left with no questions but are also nodding your head in agreement with her ""adventures"" in the job world. Whether you are thanking God you were spared jobs like these or you are feeling her pain, this book is a fantastic read."
4,Grim and honest truths of the Great Depression.,"My parents, who were teenagers in So. Dakota during the '30s, found this book brutally accurate in its description of the shock and humiliation that many rural residents lived through during the Depression. The author is capable of showing how beguiling nature can be in the Dakotas, and how nature can destroy your family and your farm in one afternoon. It is a book full of dark truths, and one may recall O.E. Rolvaag's 1927 novel ""Giants in the Earth"" for comparison."
4,Reflections,"I couldn't put it down. The writer kept my attention throughout the whole book! It was like watching a movie - I kept thinking Bren how can you stay in that house! And then to find out what was happening. What an imagination...Shar HarrellEvanston, WY"
5,Another great one by Laurie Moore,As usual Laurie Moore does not disappoint the reader with her exceptional sense of writing style. This book like all of her stories shows Ms. Moore's quick witt filling her books with tongue in cheek humor as she weaves a great who done it. I am anxiously waiting to see what comes next! Keep them coming!
1,"Wishful thinking, not scholarship","Armstrong is one of two things: either totally ignorant of her topic; or simply a liar (the term ""apologist"" being beyond euphemistic). She makes it a point to focus on and exagerrate a few neutral-to-slightly postive aspects of Mohammad's career, while totally overlooking, distilling, and distorting the bulk of his violent and intolerant career---as presented by the most authentic Muslim historical texts and Hadiths. This is not scholarship. Scholarship is supposed to be objective, taking one to wherever the truth is, not where one wants to go."
1,Is this wacko for real?,"I wish I could give this book 0 stars. I read 1 of her ""fictional"" versions of Islam and that was 1 to many.This lady is the Toyko Rose of Islam, what a polished version of an intolerant cult she pushes. Who doesshe think snowballing??"
5,Muhammad,This is one of the best book written with a clear prespective and understanding. The author has done a great work in trying to clear the cob web of history and the misunderstandings about the prophet's life that were apart of earlier western thoughts.
1,Reads like a kindly Grandmother making excuses for a naughty child,"The book is not scholarly, not insightful, not enlightening. Mohamed was complicated man who was capable of kindness as well as despicable cruelty. However, reading this book, you'll find his faults whitewashed. Despite the title of the book, Armstrong uses the excuse that Mohamed was simply acting according to HIS time for such events as engaging in sex with a child, or slaughtering his enemies on the battle field or sending assassins to kill his political enemies. If you're looking for a non-scholarly apologetic for Mohamed, this book is for you. If you looking for any objective analysis, look elsewhere."
2,Not a critical analysis,"Whether you like the book or not will depend on what you expect. I expected at least some historical-critical analysis of what we know about Muhammad. Hardly anything is said about this issue. So, either there isn't much tangible or Armstrong doesn't reveal it.If you are a faithful believer, you may believe whatever the Quran says. However, if you are skeptical, then you want to know the historical facts and the evidence. My conclusion from this book is: there is barely any hard evidence about Muhammed's life or mostly circumstantial evidence for that matter. Armstrong doesn't make much of an effort to find the historical facts about Muhammad and analyze them for their reliability. She simply retells the story about Muhammad as the Quran and later sources tell it.I am a bit disappointed about this approach. Again, it depends on your expectations.Disclaimer: I read the book only in part; however, I have listened to the audiobook in full."
2,Not Like New,"The book was purchased with the intention of it being like new as described. However book was not at all like new but had signs of storage including mildew on teh covers. Yes I can read it and the cover shouldnt matter, but then again, we book readers are a bit finicky."
3,Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time,"I received this book today (which I did purchase through Amazon, which was very fast shipment and I compliment the seller for that.However, I distinctly ordered ""Large Print"". Unless my eyes are far worse than I think, this is not large print. I will not be able to read this book either. I am so disappointed that I cannot give a review on the contents."
3,"Beautiful bag, but probably not the most functional","I bought this bag because I thought I would like to have a beautiful diaper bag. Well, in retrospect I would much rather have a functional bag. This bag only has a few pockets and it's not really that big, so I have not even used it yet. I have a couple of other diaper bags I received as gifts or that I bought. My favorite one that I really use is the medium-sized red Columbia diaper bag. It has tons of pockets and the material is anti-bacterial and machine washable. So, this Shanghai bag would probably only be good for short outings and again it is very appropriate for someone who is really concerned about having a nice looking diaper bag to carry around."
5,Loved it.,"I read this book as a teenager and re-reading it now just reminded me of all the great books I have read from Piers Anthony. I highly recommend it, especially if you are already a fan of his,"
1,Not a good ending,"I usually like Anthony's books, and I enjoyed the first two of the Adept series. This one just seems pale in comparison. Too much happening to make much sense, too many unlikely events (yeah, even in a fantasy novel). Just didn't make any sense. The fact that no one seems much surprised about the existence of a parallel universe I can't help but find odd. Heck, what seemed like a huge secret in the first two books turns out to be common knowledge to the point where no one so much as blinks an eye. Winning the games, which had been a key focus up till now, has all the excitement of watching grass grow. Even the final game is totally anti-climatic. The 'big finish' is so obvious to the reader that its painful to have to read the final three chapters Anthony takes to actually have it happen.I almost wish I'd have just quit at the first two. I'll stick with the Xanth series (although it long ago ran out of steam) and the Pale Horse series."
2,Not memorable at all,"I read the first 2 books, and read this one for the sake of finishing the trilogy. I hoped that it would be better, but unfortunately I am disappointed.Firstly, the writing just doesn't flow. The very opening of the book seems chunky and stilted. It takes quite an effort to read the whole book. Throughout, much of the dialogue seems...weird... just not natural at all. You have this sense that the characters have written their thoughts down and are reciting it.Though the storyline is on the whole acceptable, I find that much of the book is cluttered with details, details and more details. I find myself flipping over pages, even chapters, at a time, skipping tedious commentary and descriptions to get straight to the action.Piers Anthony can write better than this. Just look at most of his Xanth novels -- plots flow smoothly, the writing is fluent and fresh, etc. Somehow this one has the feel of being written when half asleep."
2,use the website,"the book is great IF you like looking at pictures. however, i purchased to book as a resource guide for where to find these materials, not just pictures of them. i ended up purchasing a subscription to their website (at the steep price of $200/year). The website is good, there are some flaws and some incorrect links and product codes but all in all its a good resource.The point of this review is: if you need products, use the website and leave the book alone."
1,A Waste of Money,"I agree completely with the previous review . . . this book doesn't provide information about where to actually purchase the materials because they are trying to get you to sign up for their membership. If you would like a simiar book with great resources you are better off with ""Transmaterial: A Catalog of Materials that Redefine our Physical Environment""."
3,Nice coasters but wouldn't be my first recommendation,We bought these for our mountain cabin that has an Elk theme. They are nice but just not as nice as I was expecting. I was disappointed in the holder they came in (I thought it would be worth keeping)... all in all I didn't think they were probably worth what we payed.
1,B Rate at Best :(,"This is a bunch of B (or C) rate CD singles from a publisher that must be trying to clear this garbage off their shelves. Yes, the price is great, but really, it not worth the cost of shipping. You'll be embarrassed to even give them away as stocking stuffers. Their best use will be as drink coasters... but hey, we all have enough of those old AOL CD's, why would we want to pay good money for more. There is a reason that they don't offer audio samples! Don't waste your time or money on these :("
4,Hip West Coast grooves,"Hip West Coast grooves that fit perfectly into the Southern California landscape. If you were around in the late 70's and remember 93 KNX FM, then you probably heard most of the cuts from the album."
3,t-shirt lite,A lite t-shirt is a lite t-shirt. I will have to see if it wears well or if the stitching falls apart like my Hay#$& underwear did.
2,THIN THIN THIN,"These are paper thin shirts!!!! They don't wash up good and stay wrinkled straight from the dryer. NOT HAPPY. Buy a better shirt and pay a bit more for the quality, you wont be unhappy with the decision."
3,"A little thin, good enough for underwear but not as T-shirt...","I was hoping these tees to be substantial enough for outerwear. That's turned out to be just that: hope. The material is rather thin, good enough for underwear or sleepwear. And make sure you order one (or even two) size up, as it shrinks substantially. I ordered size L, and after one wash it shrank to M, even with line drying. If you stick it in the drier, I won't be surprised if it goes from size L to size S."
2,Broke after 2 weeks,Still trying to figure out how to fix it so I can still use it. the suck cup is great the other part broke that goes into the suck cup.
5,Pretty strong,Pros:1. Strong suction2. Holds my dog's front half in the tubCons:1. Does not keep her rear in the tub(though not designed to do so)Other Thoughts:I bought this to make bath time easier for my Great dane who hates water and it has helped tremendously.
1,Don't do it...,"If you are thinking that it looks humble, weak and powerless, you are correct. The slightest amount of pressure against whatever surface you attempt to clean stops it dead in its whiney little tracks. Don't say you weren't warned."
3,GED study manual,Contemporary's Complete Ged: Comprehensive Study Program for the High School Equivalency ExaminationI was disappointed when I got the book because it is exactly like the one I have been using. I was tutoring someone in Math in order for her to pass the GED and she said that the test was much harder than before. I then checked with the local college to find out which book they use for their classes. It is the Complete GED. But as I said it was exactly like the one I had been using. If the test has gotten harder then someone should put out a new version of GED books so that student's can pass.
3,Outdated Textbook,"I purchased this book because it was a required to take a review course for the Texas GED, but Texas has changed it's requirements and this textbook is outdated. Make certain of your states requirements before purchasing it."
5,GED Book,This is just what my daughter needed at a great price! This is a great seller! The book got here very quickly. I recommend this seller! Thank you!
3,Good HDTV,"I bought this TV to be my first widescreen television.Here is how this TV works:The HDTV comes in fantastic, perfect images.Unfortunately, if you want to watch a normal channel (1-13), the image is blurred somewhat.This TV is great for you if all your going to do is watch HDTV. The settings for the TV are somewhat confusing, and the default picture options need to be adjusted.For the price, this is a good TV, but it is missing some options (PIP,buttons on TV, )If you have digital Cable like me, then it's worth it."
2,"product decent, but pray you don't need customer service","In an almost identical manner to another reviewer, 6 months after purchase the color went out on all inputs except the hdtv. Customer service (people in India pretending to be in the US by giving you an American name) were totally clueless. After several calls, they refer me to a local authorized repair center. Since it was out of warranty for labor, that meant $200 for me. The part, cost $700 but was covered under warranty. $65 so that I didn't have to haul the set to the repar place. It has taken 3 service visits and 1 month and the set isn't fixed yet. Adecent (not great) set when its working, but this experience will keep me from buying another Philips / Magnavox product again."
1,Completely dead after two years,"I purchased this 30"" widescreen tv in 2003, and I was pretty happy with the TV in the beginning because of the picture quality. However, in less than 1 year, it starts having problem. The module of the unit is failing. And now, it is two years, the problem is getting untolerable. I found out the cost to replace the module is $500 plus $150 for labor. It is just not acceptable. I don't know if I will ever buy another Phillips TV!"
3,"Nice, but has its problems.","I bought this tv over a year ago for $800. The pictures is nice and the only picture problems I have is because I have basic cable. DVD picture is definitely nice. I haven't had any major visual problems. I only have two problems I would like to add to all these others:1. TV has a long start up, which Philips considers normal (under 20 sec). I believe it usually at least takes five seconds to start up.2. If you accidently hit the off button on the remote and try to turn the TV back on quickly, the TV locks up and will stay in ""half on"" state. The green light is on, but dim and there is no picture. To get the TV out of this state you have to get up and unplug the TV and plug it back in. This sucks since we have a big armoire that we have to move a bit to reach the plug."
4,a good buy while I'm waiting for the LCD's to come down in $,"I got mine at Costco for the rock bottom price of $699 and with no sales pitch for extended warrantys. The picture looks good, especially with a progressive scan DVD, but I disagree with the other reviewers about this being the best picture quality. I beat my market research to death, and I think the Toshiba is better quality, and Sony at the top. However, you'll pay more for those too. This TV for me is a holdover until the flat screens loose another $2K in price, at which point I'll still come out ahead and have a nice hammedown for my parents. The only real complaint I have is the delay in flipping between channels is too long, but I gather from other reviewers this is standard on this TV. But like I said, if you want five stars, then you'll have to pay extra for it."
3,New Purchase,"I just bought the tv this afternoon at COSTCO on promotion for $599. Obviously the price is unbeatable but the tv is cumbersome taking three people to get it up two flights of stairs. Also, the instructions do NOT make it clear on how to attach it to a DVD player. It has multiple component video connections, and you do need to use the correct one for the optimum picture quality. It does NOT come with cables but once I had everything hooked up, the picture is pretty amazing. I hope that my experience is better then some of the other reviewers. This is my first HDTV so I do not have anything to compare it to. It is certainly a much better picture than my 27 inch JVC."
1,trying to sell it,"extrememly dissapointed. bought the 30"" phillips widescreen hdtv because it sounded like a good price. I won't buy for price vs. quality again. The whites are very yellow and it actually reminds me of an old tv where the tube is getting worn out. my old sony flat screen has better color actually and the phillips is very hard to adjust the tints. I'm selling it for a loss and will buy another hdtv from a different manufacturer."
1,Not worth the money,"TV started malfunctioning after 2 years of ownership. I now have faint horizontal and vertial wide green lines showing up on TV. Though not a malfunction, the TV start up very slowly as well as when changing channels.Most likely last time I will buy Philips..."
1,I can't believe so many people like this thing!,"I honestly don't understand how so many people are happy with this tv. Ever since I bought mine, in January 05 (it is now June), I've been trying to get it fixed! Does no one else notice a washed out portion on the top 1/3 of the screen with a big black stripe going through it? I can't even watch it anymore because it is so annoying. I've been thru 3 service places, none being able to fix it, even with the entire tube being replaced, and now I'm awaiting a buyback. Philips blows, people! 6 months to get satisfaction, and still all they'll do is refund my purchase price. They ought to pay my phone bills from the last few months as much as I've been on the phone with them. This sucks!"
