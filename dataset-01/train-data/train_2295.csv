4,ONLY 1 GOOD SONG,"To tell you the truth, I thought that the only good song on this album was the Ruff Ryder's Anthem. It so good, though, it makes the cd all worth it."
5,GET AT THIS REVIEW DOGS!!!! UHHHH,DMX COMES WITH SOME HARDCORE BEATS. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO COMPARE HIM WITH 2PAC BECAUSE HE IS COMING OUT IN A NEW MOVIE AND HE HAS A SUCCESSFUL CD. HIS BEATS ARE MOSTLY ORIGINAL AND HIS HOOKS ARE EASY TO FOLLOW. HE'S GOT SOME TIGHT LYRICS GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!
4,Nice Work,"DMX has great lyrics in this album. I aint a RAP fan at all but I truly love this album. The songs ""Get At Me Dog"" and ""Stop Bein Greedy"" Are great. He is a good change from all them stupid Puffy-The Magic Dragon and Master B's Songs. If you want a good album regardless of what kind of music you listen to, this is it."
3,Average Rap,"This cd is pretty good, but a lot of the songs sound the same. There are a few good ones like Ruff Ryders Anthem, Damien, and The Convo, but other than that, the music gets repititious. So it is average, but I have not listened to the other cd yet so I will see if DMX can live it out......."
1,Horrific album!!!,"This album is nonsense. All you here is barking and no directional flow. Maybe this album is just part of the learning experience and maybe he gets better in the sophmore album. Only three tracks are decent, none are phat, and the rest is non sense. Try again DMX."
1,Can it get any worse????,If you can find one good song on this CD you're a genious of immeasurable porportions. His song about the Rough Ryder's has horrible lyrics and isn't that great of a tune. The other songs lyrics are either worse or of the same quality. If you want a rap CD try getting a real rapper like Ice Cube. Stay away from this one it's horrible.
5,My personal opinion,My man and I both like DMX and it was our anniversary and I gave that to him needless to say he really enjoyed it. Especially if you like rap you will like DMX I think especially this one.
5,great cd..dmx come out of retirement enough said,dmx is great...i mean hes jus street...he seriously needs to come out of retirement cause hes..jus great
1,Extremely disappointing,"Not only were the quilt designs disappointing, the quilts in the pictures were sewn so badly I would have been embarrased even as a beginner. The seams were off by at least a quarter of an inch if not more."
5,for the love of sports,All I can say is I love it. I can save games on a cool football shaped memory card. Plus it works great too
5,Worth a reread,"I recently reread Chomsky's classic. It's very enlightening to see the parallels as well as the differences between the role America's ""intelligencia"" played during the Vietnam War and the role they are playing now with just another war ""won""."
1,Don't buy this phone,"I've had this phone shipped to me twice. Amazon sent me a new one when the first one didn't work. The second one has the same problem -- the small dialer pad is frozen and will not dial most of the time. This is an awfully designed, undependable phone that [stinks]. I wouldn't take it free. In fact, I am just eating the [price] and chalking it up to a valuable lesson -- when the first item is a piece of junk, ask for your money back."
5,Not as heavy or complicated as it looks!,"I bought this phone for my grandmother, who is in a wheelchair. She has a cordless headset that has a cord that connects the earpiece to the dialing piece. She keeps getting the cord caught in her wheels... so I decided to try this one. I connected it at home to test it out, but now I'm going to have to get her a new one... this one is mine! Features I love: it's very lightweight, the infrared dialing pad works great, you can put the charger anywhere in the house and put the desk phone somewhere else, using ""flash"" for call waiting is as easy as flipping the microphone up and back down. The sound is excellent and there is no interference. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out."
4,From the days of Middle-Brow Miniatures,"This album I found as an LP in my high school band room library circa 1978, and it followed me through 16 apartments and 12 milk crates until it came out on CD.I have enjoyed it countless times.The tradition of composers crafting ""miniatures"" is pretty much lost today, when there is virtually no light music radio programming or living room listening cocktail parties like some suburban middle-class highbrows allegedly had in the 50s and 60s.The Andre Previn selection ""Red"" is a re-working of his main title music for the film ""Bad Day At Black Rock"", or maybe the other way around; in any case it is the same piece of music. I haven't discerned a provenance for many of the other pieces, however."
1,Not Applicable for PMP Exam,I found this book is not a good study guide for PMP Exam because (1) the approach is no longer suitable; (2) none of the key points which the author suggested come into play; and (3) it provided only a generic description of project management skills and techniques which is just an elaboration of the materials found in the official project management book. It should proivde other professional project management viewpoints to enhance the value of the book.
4,Very helpful in passing the CAPM exam,"The book combined with computer based test simulations are a very good preparation regiment. The book is very terse but cuts through to the case on what you need to know to pass the test.The writing is not particularly great but is effective. It would be helpful to a bit more graphic representation of the various phases and processes. The practice tests at the end of the characters are helpful but they are not very representative of the actual questions in the CAPM test. I am not sure if the questions are representative of the PMP test.Overall, a web-based practice test should accompany the book. The CD that came with the book was helpful but the questions again were not the best representation of the test questions.The book did get me up to speed very quickly in prepartion for the test."
3,Clearly a Rehash of PMBOK,"This study guide is not much different than the PMBOK in terms of content. The presentation is mediocre at best, and is not much simpler or easier to understand than the PMBOK. This guide is helpful in that it comes with 6 sample tests on the CD; note that each test is only about 70 question, and not full-length.In contrast to this guide, the ""PMP Exam Prep"" by Mulcahy takes a much different and more effective approach with ""pseudo-games"" and exercises to help you learn the material. Although only 50% complete, I can already tell the Mulcahy book is making a difference where this guide had not."
2,Not reliable,"Studying for the PMP exam can be difficult and taking many practice tests are essential to one's success. Unfortunately, this book has numerous incorrect answers, questions and general information and lacks a lot of credibility.BEWARE: Learning incorrect information and answers can lead to failing the test. If you buy this book, use the information only to practice your test comprehension skills. Do NOT rely on it for accurate information. I repeat, do NOT rely on this book to take the test!!"
4,Great Book!! Highly recommended,"Start PMP preparation with this book, as it takes through each phase in sequence as in real projects so you can relate to whats going on (instead of studying each knowledge management area as in PMBOK). Questions in the book and the CD extremely useful...I scored 80-85% in the exercise exams and my final score was 83.5% (167/200). Use this book along with PMBOK and Rita's book, you ae guaranteed to score above 80%"
2,"Very easy to read, but don't trust it for the exam","I read the book two days before presenting my exam and felt very confident that I was ready for it. It is easy to read, the examples are very good, the companion CD and testing software is excellent. However, there are a lot of mistakes and incorrect terminology. I walked into the exam very confident and about half of the questions were very though to me because the terminology was different. I passed my exam, but I really suffered through the exam. Make sure you support everything you read here with the latest version of the PMBOK."
4,Exelent Approach,"I found this book very good in preparing for the PMP. Heldman has an exelent approach by decribing the normal processes/information/actionsflow used in an actual project. It is really easy to understand how processes, inputs, t/t, outputs, relate during the life cycle of a project. I also found really relevant the Example Case developed from beginning to end of the book. The CD is good with its multiple questions and the flascards to help memorizing important things. For its relatively low cost the benefit is high.This book + PMBok must be used in a very close way. (I didn't use other books)."
5,Simple and Beautiful,"These sandals are very cute, simple, comfortable, and well made. They will go with anything from summer dresses to shorts and jeans. The quality is excellent. I originally ordered one pair, and after receiving them I came back and ordered an additional 3 pairs in different colors. They are a little pricy, but the quality and comfort will outlast 4 or 5 pairs of cheapo's. Thrilled with my purchase. By the way, they run true to size....really great A+++++++"
4,Vaneli sandal,"Well made comfortable. Thought this shoe would be better suited for a younger person. If you have a wide foot it does not look as nice, not enough shoe and the skin pushes over the straps. Looks great on a slim foot. I would recommend it."
1,a product to kill your health,"I bought this product today 06-28-2010 and upon serving it it had to be thrown out in the 15oz can it states 51%sodium sorry to admit i did not bother to read before i bought ,it should be against the FDA standard to put that much salt in a product ,we had to throw it out trust me I will imform everyone not to buy this productDo you not have anyone you does quality control,taste what you put on market to possible kill someone with a problem that can't tolerate saltnot a happy camper----I am refering to Hormel chilli turkey no beans 98%fat free====51%saltoleta"
4,Well written! Kept me interested from start to finish.,"Considering how very little information is available about Ed Delahanty, I thought Mike Sowell did a terrific job. One could have written about Ed and others in chapters, but not Mr. Sowell. His intelligence is such that even he realized that one could never write a bonifide biography with little information. Therefore, he did what any true baseball historian would do...fill in the blanks with the times and events that surrounded your subject. Mike Sowell did an excellent job of this and I credit him with giving me enough insight of the time and characters to research them further. Today, there is not much that I do not know about the era. I still continue to read about everything baseball and the players of the time. Sad how they are being forgotten. Today's players owe them much. Thank you, Mike!Anthony DeMedeiros,Toronto, Ontario"
4,This book provides insight into the Southern Culture.,"I am an Arkansan and a Southerner, and this book provides great insight into Southern culture. Adler shows the reader what happens when people are denied fair treatment. He takes the reader on a journey from a small Arkansas town to a large Northern drug empire. The reader will be a much better person for having taken the trip."
4,interesting book,"This book is very interesting. It's not just about some drug dealers. It's about the economy, about young, poor black folk from Arkansas, about being enterprising in a bad economy, about filling a need. It's a really good, complicated book. But yes I recommend it if this is something that interests you. Also it has a lot in it about Detroit, my hometown."
1,A BAD DEAL,This company is horrible to work with. They lie on their product review BEWARE of dealing with them. They charge 10 dollars for each book. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!Then to rectify the situation they do not act in accordance with the BBB expectation of customer service. This is only the beginning of a headache for you so DON'T EVEN GET INVOLVED!
3,Not impressed,Interesting story but so slow in the middle! Cut out 75 pages in the middle and get on with it already! Way too long. Don't waste your time. The only reason it gets 3 stars is because the story is interesting.
3,If you're going to read...,"If you're going to read this, I'd recommend it only in the Cloud reader as it constantly hung up my Kindle. Average book, but really frustrating to read electronically."
2,Poorly written,"Instead of a book that you couldn't put down - this was a book that I could hardly pick up. The conversations in the book were too ordinary, the history was inaccurate, and several times I saw a repeat of a line that I had read previously. I was very disappointed after I had read the other reviews. I have read free books that were better written."
1,Waste of Time,"This book is poorly written, edited, and formatted (my new Kindle 3g hangs up on the page turns). Save yourself the aggravation and irritation (I found myself saying ""Oh come on!"" many, many times) of trying to fight through this book. Those who gave it more than one star are being generous. Love romance, hated this one."
2,OK story ... BAD programming,"This book was alright, the story would have been more enjoyable had I not had to wait up to a minute for a page turn! I would have asked for a refund for my purchase had I not downloaded this as a free book. Amazon needs to be more careful about their formatting/programming in may of the free offerings (I often find editing mistakes that interupt the flow of the story, though this is the first time I have run into this particular issue). I wouldn't recomend purchasing this book without first trying a sample to see if the technical issues have been corrected ... if it takes 5-10 sec for the page to turn, don't bother, the intervals get longer the further you get in the book!"
3,Call Home The Heart,"When suicide ends the life of a tyranical landowner, his new bride is left bewildered and saddled with a failing set of holdings. Fortunately, those lands come with a handsome, loyal, and passionate manager, Lochlainn Roche, who is more than willing to help Muireann Caldwell save his boyhood home. Their passion for Barnakilla extends to each other, then from the grave, Muireann's husband reaches out to endanger their joy. With a cloud of possible murder charges hanging over them, the lovers must clear Lochlainn's name before they can have a life together. Using a seldom utilized setting and strong characterization, Ms. Farrell has created a true gem for historical fans in search of something new and different.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,"complexed strong and interesting dance track, beautiful!","It is not so often that I find a dance track so intriguing and complexed and yet so beautiful in it's simplicity. it combines the elements of dance music with a little disco using repeating vocals which create a strong impression like in the works of such masters as fat boy slim, etc. but this track has something beyond, something fat boy slim doesn't have, that makes it spactacular - that sense of magic that comes through in a track that complitly hypnotise you and captures your soul, something less commercial and more fascinating... the stuff that true music is made of. accompanied by a sensational and strong video, this track remains as a true gem in today's musical texture... I have bought this single and will buy the album. how about you?"
4,goodstuff,"I heard this and loved it. Had heard of, but never heard, Etienne DeCrecy before, and I may be looking into more of this! The overall sound reminds me of Daft Punk (lots of Vocoder and 70s-style effects), but much more danceable, yet much less repetetive. (I do love the Daft, but they always seem to take a repeated motif one repeat too far.)To add a whole other dimension, see the music video. Normally, I would never recommend paying attention of any kind to a video, but this one actually adds to the experience instead of making me want to smash my MTV. But will I ever enjoy a hamburger quite the same way again? ARE we wrong to hunger? Whatever, just enjoy it"
1,"you can't always believe the reviews, or the manual","I bought an SD-4000, partly because of the reviews here on Amazon, so that I could play avi files on my TV. The files play perfectly on my computer, but simply would not play on the SD-4000. The small print in the manual says that avi files will play only from CD-Rs, so I split my files and burned them to CD---and they still wouldn't play.Not sure what the problem is; some reviewers of this player have had no trouble at all with avi files. Maybe you'll be lucky!!---but just in case, be sure to buy from a store with a friendly, liberal return policy."
1,Worst DVD player I have ever used.,"If someone gives this to you for free, don't take it. The player doesn't even play CDs. I also have issues with the audio separating from the video. After about 30 minutes, it becomes very noticeable. I have to press stop and play to make them almost match. Another thirty minutes later, I have to do it again. It does respond slowly as someone else mentioned. You have to hit a button and wait for it to decide what to do. It drove me nuts when I first got it. Overall, this player should never have been manufactured at all."
1,lasted 10 months,"Not recommended.It worked OK for 10 months. Now every disk gives ""bad disk"" and it won't play anything. About 5-10 DVDs per week, so I wouldn't call it heavy use either.I didn't use any of the DivX or advanced functions so can't comment on those."
1,Horrible DVD Player,"This DVD player was at a hotel I stayed at this winter. I imagine they bought it for every room because it was so cheap, but it's cheap for a reason. This DVD player simply does not work. I put in a DVD that I brought along and it said ""bad disc"". I took it out, cleaned the disc and the player, and it still said ""bad disc"". I went out to buy a new DVD figuring that mine was actually bad, I put the DVD in the player, and it still said ""bad disc"". I read another review that said the same, so I know it is not just this DVD player. I am very disappointed in the performance and would never recommend this to anyone."
2,Lasts for a while...,"Like the previous reviewer, this entry-level SD DVD player works pretty well for a few months to a year - then gradually more and more disks become unreadable. The newer Netflix stuff still works 75% of the time, but older DVD all say ""Bad Disc"".An appliance like this should last at least 5 years, not one..."
1,poorly designed,"The Good:It will almost play anything you put into it.THE BAD:This unit has given me more problems than anything i have ever owned. It has no real functions on the face (play-eject), the coax out for digital audio causes a high pitched ringing when it is paused or stopped. This sound from the digital connection will break glasses in your home, and make your ears bleed if you have a large home theater system! Also you can not pick, switch, or program this unit with out it hooked up to the TV, that is the only place you can see anything, since the display shows you nothing.I switched the unit for another, and I got the same high pitched thing in both units, so i returned it for a full refund!"
2,Not media friendly,"Too many issues with reading disks. I burn my own, buy and rent and I have trouble on and off with all types of disks. I had 2 previous models of this unit that locked up on me frequently. I sent both back. In fairness to Toshiba they have excellent customer service. I guess you need to spend >100$ to get a good DVD player. I'm going with OPPO next. They have excellent reviews on thier players. No DVD player is perfect but I expect them to at least play OEM disks I bought."
2,No problems for 3 months,"I'm not very knowledgeable about technical things. All I knew was that I needed a DVD player, and Toshiba was a reputable brand name, and that the product price tag was reasonable.For about 3 months I used this DVD player, just about everyday. I never noticed anything wrong with it, such as the audio & visual not playing together, which other reviews mention. Then one day it started to freeze up on me, skipping and what not. I gave it a rest for a couple days, but about a week later, it just wouldn't even load a DVD to it's main menu. I'm not sure if it was me that did something wrong to make it stop working, I would like to know if it did so I don't repeat the same mistakes.I do know one thing: DVD PLAYERS DON'T STOP WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS - BUT THIS ONE DOES!!!"
1,Audio is often unsynchronized or doesn't play at all.,"Purchased one and after a few days the audio would drop out completely. Thinking it was a lemon I returned it for a replacement. The new one was fine for a while, but now the audio becomes progressively more unsynchronized as it plays and often drops out completely if the video is reversed or fast forwarded. I applied the firmware patch mentioned in another review, but it didn't solve any problems.Stay away from this model!"
5,Love,We love Mercer Meyer around this house and this was just a great book to add to our collection. Wish we could have found a new copy.
1,A text that serves the author only,"This is one of the worst texts I have read. It reads more like a marketing brochure for a ""team building"" consultant rather than giving practical advice on actual team building. Every dilemma is resolved by consulting with a team building consultant, or facilitator.Of much greater value is ""The Wisdom of Teams"" by Katzenbach and Smith - a book I would give 5 stars for thoroughness and practicality."
1,Buyer Beware - This is a VERY shoddy product,"Being cheaper than most of the torchiere halogen lamps out there, I jumped on this. But it turns out, you get what you pay for (surprise, surprise). This is a very shoddy product. The ends where you screw on are made of plastic and are very prone to getting stuck. Mine got stuck this way. I cannot get the top lid to screw on correctly and now it is stuck and won't unscrew so I cannot return it. In attempting to unscrew the lid the entire assembly of the lid fell apart. I would HIGHLY recommend spending a few more bucks and purchasing something that assembles without falling apart. It looks like I am going to just throw this in the trash the same day I received it. $30 down the drain. Worthless product."
3,"Love halogen torcheires, but they're not reliable.","I love this kind of lamp for the variable brightness and the indirect lighting. Put it in a corner in a room with light-colored walls and it's great. They are a fire hazard which is why they come with a metal guard and only a 300W bulb (I immediately replace these with the 500W bulbs of course).The downside is that the dimmer switches are built pretty cheaply and will wear out on you within a couple of years. Oh well, the lamp's pretty cheap anyway, so I will continue to stock my home with this kind of lamp until I get around to installing some track lighting or something."
3,Cheaply made but gets the job done,"The light arrived promptly enough. It does not have a dimmer switch as seemed to be suggested by the description, but rather a two-level on switch. No big deal there. It also did not include any extra light bulbs as the description seemed to imply.The light is not terribly bright but gets the job done. The problem with it is that it flickers like a firelight sometimes. Nothing I can do about it - just have to wait until it's finished."
3,"Torchiere Lamp had hi-lo settings, not dimmer switch","Product discription for Torchiere lamp said model includes Dimmer Switch, but it simply had a high/low lamp setting. Other reviews seem to indicate they have continuous dimming. Out of the box, the knob was loosely attached and seemed likely to break quickly (though has lasted a month with minimal use). And the lamp does not (mine anyway) come with an Additional Free 300W bulb as the product title seems to indicate. (It might be that some states only allow 150W bulbs for safety and they're pointing out you won't have to buy your own bulb to ""upgrade"" to 300W; that said, there was no secondary 150W bulb as a back-up if the 300W bulb burns out. For $25 that seems fair, but the description is misleading.)Shipping was in about 7-10 days. Product was acceptable quality for relatively low price, however the $9.90 shipping to NYC added another 40% to the cost. Customer service follow-up good."
1,Unusable,"Other reviewers are correct: this lamp is extremely shoddy in design. The ends of the poles which are supposed to screw together aren't constructed well, and it is easy to get the lamp halfway assembled and then find that one of the joints simply won't screw in place -- and that you can't take apart what you've already done, either. I spent most of an hour trying to wrestle this thing into standing up straight.It also comes in a huge amount of styrofoam packing material, so constructed that you have to break up the packaging in order to get the product out. It's not environmentally friendly and it doesn't make it easy to return the lamp, either.I did finally get the lamp more or less assembled (though the pole was always a little tiny bit crooked). It then worked for eight days before the included bulb blew. The caging over the bulb doesn't look fun to remove and change, and I'm sick of this piece of garbage anyway. I'm throwing it away. Don't waste your money."
1,Worst Company,"I never received this lamp so I don't know the quality of the lamp, however, I do know that the company is one of the worst I've ever dealt with. I cancelled the order same day but the company shipped the lamp anyway even after repeated emails so I refused the order from Fed-Ex. The company does not return emails. You will receive an automated email telling you they will respond within 3 days but in actuality you never get an email from a live person. I have emailed the company for 3 weeks with nothing but automated responses telling me I'd get an email from a person within 3 days. Amazon is refunding my money because of the problems I've had wiht this company."
2,Broken Upon Delivery,"I've needed this kind of light in my apartment for a while now. However, when I was assembling the light, I discovered that the head was not properly screwed on. It cannot be repaired easily; the parts in the head are weirdly assembled and not simple to take apart. Also, the dimmer knob is wobbly and not tight.Basically, if I don't touch it, and it just stands there, it's fine. If I bump it, or turn it on or off, it's pretty unstable."
4,Good low end lamp,I was pleasently supprised with the ease the Lamp went together.It was an inexpensive lamp that turned out to be a good buy.
1,garbage and possibly faulty electronics,"BEWARE: for starters the package that this arrived in required Total destruction in order to unpack, so the likelihood you'll be able to return it is zip - you actually have to cut apart the styrofoam,further... their were white spots/blobs (melted styrofoam?) all over the wireFollowing an absurdly long unpack & set up, the lamp ran for 2 two days - before dying. OK I thought perhaps the original bulb got shook up in shipping. Replaced it -- SAME results: died in a day or 2.All this led me to believe there was likely something questionable with the electronics...The only nice thing I have to say, is that during it's ever-too short working life it cast a rather pretty pattern on my ceiling.Lastly: did not seem to output nearly as much light as my last 300w halogen... (possibly cuz bottom bowl not as reflective?)"
3,Nice but not as nice as others,"Nice lamp for the money but base is not very heavy. For only a couple of more dollars I gat another one with a heavier base. Very nice dimmer switch. Packing was not that great, cord was worn through at one place."
5,Made Daughter Happy,"This lamp was purchased for my daughter's ""first apartment."" She has been delighted with it."
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent. Solid construction, stylish design, and bright! I bought two for my office."
2,dim light,"I was expecting more light from a 300W halogen. The glass piece on the underside lets very little light through, so it does not really function as a down-light at all. But it certainly is inexpensive."
2,Broken On Delivery,"The lamp was everything advertised but when it arrived the acrylic accent was broken and it came with presumably missing parts because there was no way to attach the base to the pole. The dimmer switch comes right off too. What can you expect for the price, I guess?"
5,Floor Lamp,I love this product and will be ordering more of these in the near future.....item arrived in excellent condition and worked soon as it was assembled!
2,Spring for a real needle threader,"I definitely would not waste my time and money buying this variety of needle threaders. I have used these and they do work great, but they are SO easy to lose and bend. For just a few dollars more you can get a very sturdy Clover needle threader that works like a champ every time and includes a thread cutter!Here is a great overview and tutorial on how the Clover needle threader works."
1,Not worth the time,I purchased these along with another type of needle threader. Much to my surprise these are difficult to use and are not worth the time.
4,Dritz Looped Needle threaders,These are good for people with less than perfect eyesight to use for threading needles with small eyes. My only complaint is that sometimes the top ot the eye twists and this makes the loop work poorly. It is next to impossible to untwist it.
3,Ping-Li's Kite,"When a young boy makes a kite and flies it before it is painted, the emperor of the sky grows angry. He commands the boy to make the best kite on his dragonship. When the boy succeeds, the emperor is happy and the boy flies his new kite.This retelling of a classic Chinese folktale is accomplished by subdued illustrations. Readers will appreciate the portrayal of Chinese culture more than the story itself."
1,doesn't hold air,"I ordered this for my kindergarten classroom as we are studying Monarch Butterflies. At each stage, I've inflated and hung the egg, caterpillar, crysalis, and getting ready for the butterfly - it won't hold air. I don't need to return everything, only get a replacement for the butterfly, but have not heard what to do! Very frustrating for the beginning of our school year...."
1,"bad voals, digitally dehanced","i agree with the first person. bought this cd not knowing what was in store, sold it a month later. weak vocal recordings of bob put to souped up music some dudes did in a studio ten...twenty or more years later....to make a buck. i don't think bob would buy this, and neither should you."
5,EpiSoothe shampoo for dogs,The product arrived in a very timely manner. I was unable to get it locally from my vet as I had done for years. I was told by their office is was on backorder. I was very pleased with the results of using this method to obtain this product.
5,A must have for managers!,I really enjoyed reading this insightful cutting edge leadership book. It is a must read for all managers that want to move their organization forward.
1,Poor quality!,"I ordered this because the earbuds that came with my razr phone no longer worked. I was excited when I got these, but excitement soon turned to disappointment. The sound was very tinny and the volume was extremely low. I could hardly hear the person on the other end and kept having to ask them to repeat themselves. Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive set."
2,crap,not enough space between straps and bottom of sandal. I don't even have fat feet and they are toooo tight
5,Read it; tried it. It works.,I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to read this book before it became widely available. All I can say is that it really works. The points are easy to understand and easy to apply.I put the principles that the book outlines into practice when I was leaving a previous job. The result - things went quite smoothly and I still have a good relationship with my old organization and coworkers.
2,Not My Experience,"I read Culture Shock before traveling to Dubai and found almost everything described in the book either incorrect or outdated. Granted, I never traveled outside of urban areas and mostly dealt with business people in the Emirates but found everyone I met with to be genuine and warm.In my opinion the UAE is a unique place in the world, and not only looks to the future on a grand scale but has the funding and vision to make it happen.I agree that one should be sensitive to cultural differences, but not to the degree of that the author indicates."
2,Uneven and self-indulgent,"This book is a curious mix of successes and failure. Some of the characters are memorable and sharply drawn (the grandmother, Theresa), others are just a collection of cliches and forgettable (the narrator who is the voice of the novel most unfortunately). I'll admit that I lost interest in the story about 2/3 of the way into it. This was because the plot was so meandering and I had ceased to care about the characters. The best thing about the novel is its treatment of the Armenian genocide (a freighted term, which if you are already informed about this historical period you will know). The early sections dealing with this are terrific and memorable. Once the action is transferred to Connecticut it starts to deflate. Also praiseworthy is the treatment of the Armenian diaspora in the U.S. With a lot of editing to sharpen the focus and weed out the family drama cliches this would have been a better book. Oh well."
1,READ THE 'NEW YORK' MAGAZINE REVIEW IT'S CLASSIC.,"This may not be the worst novel ever written, but then again it might,according to the New York Magazine review which essentially made this first novel the poster child for sophmoric bad prose. And this thing may not be perfect, but at least this woman finished a novel which is hard to do, and at least she wanted to be a writer, which, I suppose, is a noble pursuit, and yes maybe the title makes you want to hang yourself, it's THAT, pompous, but what the hell, we're all just people, and we're all brothers and sisters, and I could drift off into a million directins now because I've been drinking, but basically the book's bad but it's not as bad as depicted in the New York review, nor as funny. It's just not good, but what's more criminal than this book, is the review which appeared to have crushed this author's spirit, which is sad, because she has potential or had potential. Asta La Vista, baby. -R. Ford."
3,"Fun, off the wall","AS in any fiction, we read it to escape and enjoy the ride. This was a fun ride, a bit aimed at teens, or tht age group, but it was fun."
4,"Looked/Felt Great, but ....","These boots are a great color, have a comfortable wedge heel, and looked so darn cute, especially with jeans ... except they were too snug around the calf and tended to bunch around the ankle (probably because they were so tight around the calf). Had to send 'em back, but if my legs were skinnier, I would've loved 'em!!"
3,"Works great, but.....","I like this fob, and the price is certainly right. I had quite a time programming my minivan to learn it's code. The internet instructions seemed a little vague, and though I followed them the best I could, the van wouldn't respond. I started messing about with the buttons and experimented, and eventually got it programmed, but it was frustrating. I didn't end up contacting the supplier for help, but that might be necessary if you're not as lucky as I was.You should know that you will need one properly functioning fob programmed for your vehicle to program the new fob. Either that, or have a dealer do it. Ouch!"
2,Low quality,"This item was rather embarrassing; it doe not have the shadows and 'embossed' look it appears to have in the photo. More of a flat surface, cut-out, design."
1,very basic and boring,If you want to learn London Bridge or Marry had a little Lamb.Does not have enough techniques for the beginner!
2,A Disappointing Dictionary in Swedish,"I bought this book for my family as my wife is Swedish and we are raising our kids in both languages. I returned it as the book really didn't have a Swedish to English section that actually had all the 28 letters of the Swedish alphabet. The phoenetic pronunciations were difficult to decipher and did not seem correct as I had learned them from a native speaker. The content was poorly organized, and the illustrations were a boring, 50's, retro sytle that did not grab my attention and were less likely to interest my kids. A bit disappointing in all. I might be acceptable as a way to introduce kids to Swedish if you have no previous exposure to the language. I prefer the DK publishing Inc., (My First Word Book)photographic style for a Children's Dictionary. I wish they would publish one in English and Swedish."
5,Good piece of backup software,"First let me say two things to those who are complaining that it doesn't work with their CD burners:o You should have checked the compatibilty listo You should have downloaded the FREE 30-day trialSome pros for it:o It allows you to backup over networked drives (very cool)o It allows you to password protect your backups (cool again)A few cons:o I don't love the interface, don't hate it, but don't love ito The compression isn't ""great"", I also get about 1.3:1Overall, I would have rated it 4-stars, but since I saw a few morons giving it 1-star for no good reasons, I wanted to defend it's honor a little.I'm still using the 30-day trial, so far so good. I recommend you try it out first before you buy.Also, BackupMyPC was associated with Veritas, which is a VERY good backup system for large servers and such, and the quaility is still with BackupMyPC.My opinion."
1,"Compression information mismatch"" error on Windows XP Home","V6.0 of this software is buggy in both compression modes, posting the following error:""Compression information mismatch [4886-1316]""Make sure you Verify your backup with this product!Very poor Support."
1,Be sure to thoroughly test eval copy,"I, too, initially thought some reviewers might be clueless after I downloaded the eval copy and tried it with my system. I ran the disaster recovery backup, and everything was working fine with my listed-as-supported LG cd burner using cd-rw discs--until I ran out. Then I tried a cd-r and it rejected it as already having data on it that needed to be rewritten by the program blah blah. Unable to find any reference to such a problem in the documentation or online support (which to me is worse than the problem itself when evaluating new software), I decided to start over with cd-r's in case it had some problem with switching media types while a backup was in progress. It still rejected every cd-r type I had. Makes me wonder who is clueless and who is lucky."
1,Easier to simply type your files back on your computer,"Is the stuff America makes when the manufacturing jobs get shipped to China?? I presume it is designed and made in America... SHAME. First, I read that my TDK drive was supported, but the software wouldn't work. Alas, my drive would work if it was the external model, but not if it was the internal model???? I wanted my money back ... but they ignored my e-mail and the company I purchased it from wouldn't accept it back. I gave it to a friend ... he had a supported CD Drive. It made his Disaster Recovery Disks (to floppies), but won't write to his CD. First he was told it was bad media. We then bought expensive media ... still wouldn't work...then we were told it was a conflict with either his Roxio or CD Creator software (...well what writing software does the remainder of the world use??) Now he's mad at me for wasting several days of his time. My suggestion is that you use your inherent consumer capitalistic power and STOMP on this software."
3,More on BackUp MyPC,"This product would do an emergency recovery disk up until Windows XP Service Pack 1 was released. If that is your goal, try Norton Ghost. Stomp could be more forthcoming with this news.Product has done a nice job for me backing up my files to DVD.Product is based on Vertias backup products which are industrial strength."
1,Wish I could Stomp on this Software with my foot!,"After my hard drive failed I really wanted to get good back up software. I read the reviews in magazines and online and they all said this was the best. Well, it isn't. Far from it. I have installed it and re-installed it about 5 times, called tech support and e-mailed them many times. Followed all their advice and changed all my configurations, hardware drivers, uninstalled other apps, tried different brands of CD-R and CD-RW etc. etc. Never could get it to work at all. I have a great coaster collection. I am very frustrated, but worst of all, I still don't have back up software!I have a Dell 4000 notebook with Windows XP, plenty of RAM and my CD-RW is ""supported"" by the software, but it just won't work. A waste of money AND time!! Wish I could get my money back. My time is lost forever."
1,Doesn't even support Dell drives!!!,"The software appeared not to be able to back up across multiple CDs, which is the only reason I had bought it. I then found in the documentation a line saying that some versions don't support this option, without any way to know whether mine did or not. Customer support via e-mail responded after 72 hours, with some suggestions that were irrelevant, such as running msconfig when they had already confirmed that I have Windows 2000, for which msconfig doesn't apply. Then I checked the list of supported drives and found that the Samsung CDRW/DVD that came standard with my Dell Latitude is NOT supported.PLEASE, PLEASE check the list of supported drives BEFORE purchasing this software!!!!!"
4,"So far, it has worked great for backups and restores","I used it with a windows 98 SE pc.It backed up my system fine, when choosing individual drives or folders or files.One time, while backing up the ENTIRE pc, over 80 gigs of data across 3 hard drives, (on an old underpowered Celery 300), it hung up.So I only gave it 4 stars.Maybe it is slightly worse than the 4 stars I give it, after seeing other reviewer's writeups. But for my own experiences, it has worked rather well and it backups up real fast, using CDRW or CDR media."
2,Disaster recovery doesn't work on WinXP SP1,"I purchased BackupMyPC based on two glowing reviews, which told of the disaster recovery feature. That was the whole reason Ipurchased the program. I install the product, and attempt to create a disaster recovery CD-ROM, and it tells me that it can't do that because Microsoft's SP1 has been installed on my WinXPsystem.I just went through having to reload WinXP, update off the Microsoft web site, then restore off my Microsoft backup file.Just what did this product buy me when its disaster recoveryfeature doesn't work? NOTHING!Chris Shakercjshaker@shaker-net.com"
1,Poorly Designed and Poor Technical Support,"After backing up 16 DVDs and nearing the end I accidentally hit the eject button on the wrong drive. The program didn't ask me if that's what I meant to do--it simply ended! All tech support would say is they'd pass it to their programmers to consider in the future. Very shoddy design in my opinion. I tried to rebuild the catalog so I didn't have to redo hours of backup and after asking me to insert all 15 disks, it couldn't read the 16th--the one it shut down earlier, and so quit again. Tech support didn't even respond. I cannot get it to rename a DVD without reformatting and it insists on defaulting to its own naming system (though you can override it). Should have saved me time...instead cost me a LOT of time. I cannot recommend this program."
5,Not to be listened to by lovers of shopping music,"OK. Imagine this: four guys enter the stage, pick up their instruments and start to play. What are they playing? Hard to say. It might be jazz, except that it's not. But then, it certainly isn't classical, pop or rock. All I can say is that it tends to be loud and fast. What are they playing on? Hold tight: violin, cello, clarinet and accordion (!). I know. I always thought the accordion was a pretty stupid instrument myself. But adding some guitar peddle effects to the accordion greatly improves its sound. Same for violin, cello (which in fact can be played as one would play a guitar) and clarinet.Oh. And you should hear them play their cover of Eleanor Rigby (Beatles).Although most of DAAU's music is instrumental, this is no shopping music version. Definitely too interruptive ;-)"
5,amazing!!!,I have see this belgian in Bourges and a week later I buy the cd you should buy this record
2,let down,"With ""Zork"" in the title you'd expect the game to be set somewhere in the original Zork underground; but there are only passing comments about such places as ""flood control dam #3"" etc. I would have dissmised that as marketing if the game had been even half good, which it ain't. The graphics are ok, and the 360 deg scroll thing is nice, but in my opinion the Journyman #3 did a better job there. The one area that I'd give 4 stars to is the movie clips, pretty good. My main complaint though is that the story line sort of sucks... I'm a gammer not a soap junkie. The whole storyline smells of a really, really bad soap opra chliche. A tragic love story, an affair, murders... give me a break. And sticking severed heads on electrodes isn't my idea of ingenious puzzle content."
1,Zork Nemesis,Bought it because it sounded really interesting. Never got it to run on my computer. Continuoslly locked up my system. Actually threw away the disc. Didn't feel it was worth wrecking my computer for.
4,Sweet...,"This game is all that I remember, and more. Even though (by today's standards), the graphics aren't all that dynamic, it is still a tried and true favorite of mine. Also, I expected a reasonably good quality product, it was almost mint condition with no scratches or signs of degradation. My hat is off to you all. I have never been a big online shopper, but Amazon.com has always been the way to go for me, I have never had an issue with this site."
3,A mixed- bag of essays on a highly interesting subject,"Silberstein and Cohn are to be commended for honing in on a highly interesting subject, and for gathering together scholars from a wide number of fields to consider various aspects of it. However the results so far as I can tell are very mixed. I found offensive Adi Ophir 's absurd contention that Israeli Jews reading the Haggadah regard the 'Other' as defeated Palestinian Arabs. I also was not thrilled by Hanan Hever's analysis of the Canaanite conception of the 'other'.My own principal concern in considering the question of the 'other' in the Jewish tradition relates to the conception of Mankind created in the 'image of G-d'. As among others Rabbi Irving Greenberg teaches this sense of the 'dignity of the other 'means that they are our ' equals'. How this translates in our understanding of our own special role in the world is major question that yields no easy answer."
2,Not really good sizing,"I ordered this as an XX large to wear over other clothes and my daughters seem to like these very large shirts. However, the waistband is definitly not XX large, it isn't even what I would call a good large, so if you need a big size be very aware of that."
5,great,great balls this will come in handy for almost anything you need. I just done know why I gotta keep typing cause I dont know what else to say.
4,Interchangable Hitch Ball,"I have two trailers and both use different sized balls. This a great solution. They really do change very easy. And they seem to be of good quality. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the instructions say to keep downward force on the ball. So I keep worrying about the larger trailer, when unloaded, putting upward force on the ball while bouncing about. This has not been a problem yet. Just a concern."
3,So - So,"the book was fairly uninteresting and almost too broad. I felt like after every tiny section, he assumed you understood and just moved on. I was really clueless and was wanting just any information I could get my hands on. I did learn a little but it wasn't necessarily that helpful. The other reason I chose this book was because the author's name came up when I was discussing Malcolm Gladwell with a friend of mine. I assumed he might be just as intriguing but I got quite the opposite within the text."
2,"Not a good starter book, not a good advanced book.","I purchased this book with the idea of giving it to my Grandson, but for someone who knows absolutely nothing about stocks, it is much too broad and superficial. It jumps from one barely related topic to another without really explaining any of them. The ""Stocks for Dummies"" format interjects enough distracting trivia to keep the reader from focusing. Why would you throw a paragraph on triple witching days into a beginner's book?Deeper into the book there is a pretty good section on financial statements, but all in all I don't think it's a good choice for anyone. Beginners need a slower, more focused book; experienced investors need more depth. Compared to everything else it hardly matters, but I've rarely seen a book with worse graphics or formatting. It's a dog's breakfast."
4,Very good starter book for investing,Very entertaining. Great starter book for investing. Really simplifies the stock market. Great insight on how to manage risk. I highly recommend.
4,Market for Dummies,Good clear prsentation of the various facits of the stock market. Designed for the novice. Does the job in good fashion
3,"""Clueless"" is informative, but lamely written.","This book is a simple, straightforward introduction to the stock market. For the most part it's good. In some places, however, the writter throws in things like ""Otherwise, people would be dumping their stock like the colonists dumped tea into the harbor."" I had to laugh. In short, I don't really think Godin is a talented writter, but seems to know his stock market stuff."
5,Start here if your even thinking of investing!,"This book is great for beginners! It is presented in a clear entertaining manner. I went from being clueless to feeling informed, and comfortable enough to jump into the investment world. Investment terminology is no longer intimidating, and the resources the book suggests are exactly what a beginner is looking for."
1,Not a great book for the beginner,"Picked this up thinking it would be a good intro to the market. I was badly mistaken. You can tell the author knows a lot about the stock market, but he does not know how to explain it to someone new. I do not recommend this to beginners because of the wordage, and also don't recommend it to more advanced users as it is probably a rehash of what you already know."
3,Stock Market,An interesting read for anyone who knows very little about the interworkings of the market and global economics.
4,"Good book, But you Need to GO Further",These days it's really hard to find trading knowledge that is practical & simple to understand.Most of the info outhere is full of the same thecnical analysis jargon that makes you lose a lot of times. Basically most tehcnical trading books tell you the same story but organized in different chapters using different words and charts as examples.Some places on the web have pretty practical information. One site that I recommend is StressFreeTraders com. They have a pretty clear way for trading stocks with momentum using easy to understand strategies. This is also one place where you can understand why knowing how to approach the rally is critical for your stock trading success.
5,Required Reading for all pilots. Not just high performance pilots.,"After reading this book, you will understand your engine and you will understand your aircraft MUCH better. Most pilots I know (self included) speak in terms of approximations guesses and hand me down procedures that often times don't have roots in science, and engineering. ""Set the throttle about here for cruise"", ""Set the mixture about here for cruise"" are things that I hear commonly during ""hangar talk"". After reading this books most of your questions regarding engine performance and aircraft performance will be answered. There is math in this book but it is not essential to the understanding of the material. Professor Eckalbar will explain to you exactly how to turn back to the runway on takeoff engine failure, if it is possible at all. You will have numbers to fly by after reading this book, not guesses and maybes."
4,OEM Toner the only real way to go,"I've tried the refills,but the original is so superior - slightly more superior at the beginning, and the difference just grows. So it's not cheap, but it's the best value."
1,"Generic, not original",This product arrived as a generic toner cartridge. It was not the NEC 20-122 that was listed. The product is working but obviously at this time I do not know if it will stand up to the number of copies that a NEC 20-122 cartridge will produce.
5,"Poignant, beautiful phrasing","What a masterful recording this is. Frank and Riddle in an intimate setting, singing songs that are not hits or even especially well-known. It matters little because the inimitable Chairman phrases every word beautifully and several of the songs will send shivers down your spine. Sinatra is in beautiful voice here, and the tender ballads are amazingly clear on this remastered disc. I would not recommend this CD if you're new to Sinatra or are just building a collection. Sample several greatest hits packages first, concentrating on his Capitol years. But if you've got everything else in your collection and are in the mood for some wistful, tender singing, spin this and you'll fall in love."
1,disappointment,"I usually love Sinatra, as anyone who sees my collection knows, but this CD is so down, so slow and labored I could not listen to all of it at first. Later I found it was all the same, the arrangements are so slow, almost dirgelike."
2,5 stars? You're kidding!!,"This is easily the worst Sinatra/Riddle/Capitol record and I'm not surprised it's been unavailable for years.Sinatra wanted to record something with the Hollywood String Quartet and this is the result. He's in wonderful voice, but the material stinks and Riddle's scores are painfully dragging. He simply doesn't have enough musicians on these dates and the strings are headache inducing.""Blame It On My Youth"" is the standout, but you can keep the rest. The emperor has no clothes on this one"
4,Determinedly managing without IQ tests,"A very readable account of the 1960's Soviet education system, from nursery classes to post-graduate university, along the way taking in the youth organizations - Octoberists, Pioneers and Komsomol. Includes brief details of the evolution of the system from pre-Revolutionary times, through the Revolution and after; plus some incidental illumination on the path to Communist Party Membership and leadership, on the social power of Factory Committees, and more. Not to be dismissed as 40-50 years out of date, this book is still useful as background to the education system today in the various former Soviet republics and potentially also to stimulate and inform the ever-continuing debate in our own society on the merits and demerits of comprehensive, mixed, streamed and/or setted education; curriculum development; hours and years to be spent in school; discipline, relationships between school and parents, and more."
3,Other Books,"Thriller type book about a young captain of industry type that is not interested in anything but power, and sex is something you need to do. He has a partner in crime but it all changes a bit when he meets someone."
5,Crisis Clock,This book was totally engaging! Couldn't wait to turn thepage and see what was going to happen next!
4,Best of Broadway - a great introduction to great Broadway music,"This CD has been a longtime favorite for our family as we travel in the car, ever since the kids were 4-5 and since. Being in my early 40s, I was not familiar with all of the musicals represented by songs here. The music not only has been a lot of fun to listen to, but has inspired us to see some of the musicals or films inspired by the musicals. An excellent introduction to Broadway music!"
2,Misguided,"I have a big problem with this product in the fact that several of the recordings are from the FILM versions of these shows. Those are The King and I, Oklahoma, Carousel, Fiddler.Why do a thing like that???? It's titled THE BEST OF BROADWAY, and it's very misleading."
3,"Hunters hunt dinosaurs, dinosaurs hunt back.","VHS begins with a ""Mercedes-Benz car commercial.Four years have gone by since the first Jurassic Park (1993) film. Can they out-do themselves with this second film? Well, they bring back jeff Goldblum, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards and Richard Attenborough and then they add Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite.More suspenful and terrifying than the first film.The next film: Jurassic Park III (2001)."
4,Great Movie... better soundtrack,This is a great classic movie. Not overwhelmed by special effects and a good story line. Soundtrack is also great.
4,"Great music, laced with sorrow and joyous hope.","Despite being a little repetitious, the music on this CD is haunting and awe inspiring as the music is designed to follow mankind as they face their possible extinction and how each individual character deals with this possible reality.Every track is reserved and designed to wash over you with subtlety of sorrow and joyous hope. It is a wonderful CD, one that I think any music lover can enjoy."
2,Not worth the price,I use it with a Cross Gel rolling ball (0.7mm) refill. Have used the pen for about 3 months. Didn't find ink quality/flow as smooth as a Pilot G2-7 gel ink pens. Cap caused scratches to develop on the the top of outer barrel as well as the black portion of the barrel where one typically holds the pen to write.The blue/chrome combination looks good; but not worth the price given the flimisiness of the finish and quality/flow of ink compared to other (much less expensive) pens.
4,Repackaged classics,"I saw this in the Amazon catalogue but could find no mention of it on Activision's web site or on the interactive fiction newsgroups. And as I write this, there is not one word of description of this item on Amazon's website, beyond the title and cover picture. So I bought it to see what it was. The box and CD are labelled ""Zork Classics -- Interactive Fiction"" (I don't know where Amazon got the title ""The Zork Collection"" from) and the games included are: Zork I, II and III, Enchanter, Sorceror, Spellbreaker, Wishbringer, Beyond Zork and Zork Zero: The Revenge of Megaboz. Packaging is all but non-existent -- a CD rattling around in a box, but there are Acrobat files on the CD with manuals, maps and other paraphernalia (the calendar etc. from Zork Zero is there, for example, which I think is required to solve the game).If you like interactive fiction and are looking for a way of getting hold of these classic Infocom games, this is one way."
3,Zork Classics Hit or Bust,"You all heard of Zork? Now, have you ever played any of the Zork classics.(like zork 1 and zork 2 etc.)Well, if you did, you will know that they are text-based games and they have little to no color and small pictures. Besides this, the text is funny and it tells the story well and there is a lot to do in them. You probably will spend up to aleast two to three hours playing depending on the amount of time you play. With this 9-game set you get all the text-based Zork games and four Enchanter series games. For a text-based game I think everyone will enjoy it and you will spend hours to hours with hilarious fun."
4,Hey can't beat the classics!,For anyone that likes to go back and play some classics! You can't beat this game collection. It has all the best of the origial Zork world! A gotta have for the TRUE Zork fan!
5,A very useful study aid,"A great book for anyone interested in U.S. mass communication law, covering topics such as First Amendment guarantees, libel and slander in mass communication, privacy, obscenity, freedom of the press, commercial speech and FCC regulation of mass media, explained through U.S. Supreme Court decisions (v.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, Miller v. California, New York Times Co. v. United States). Specially interesting is the discussion about content restraint of motion pictures (chapter IV) and TV (chapter XI), the latter an issue back on newspapers after a recent Supreme Court decision (United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.)."
3,"Not the best of tools, but passable.","The raviolli it makes are a bit big and it doesn't cut all that well, but it does beat having nothing at all. Think I'll try a press next time."
4,Ravioly stamp,"The ravioli stamp worked well, but I had to manually cut the squares apart. I understood the stamp was supposed to stamp, seal, and cut the pockets. Except for having to trim the squares, the stamp worked well."
1,another book,"i just wanted to tell you hat there was another book tiled laughter in hell.it was written by stevemarek,and is about what prisonners in a japanees prisom camp did durning the second world war.i have a copy of this book."
1,Do not buy any of the self working books!,"All of Karl fulves books are unhelpful. I wasted hours and hours reading and practicing the effects only to get negative results. Everyone thought the tricks were awful. This is why:With a few exceptions, self working tricks aren't very good. A trick needs a gimmich to be easy or one needs sleight of hand. For magic books, Mark wilsons books are superb. The tricks fool people including the mental magic section. This book is not good for magicians. The best way to become a magician as the experts say is to start with Sleight of hand. There are many sleights that aren't that difficult yet astounding.Of 5 of Fulves books, i have got one trick that is actually good surprisingly, the cups and balls which many many books talk about."
1,Doesn't have any really good menatl effects.,This book is not for the semi-pro or pro mentalist. I did not find any effects in this book that I would use in a mentalist act.
4,Self-Working Mental Magic,Some awesome stuff in here. I use several of the effects all the time. Definitely worth the small price.
1,Propaganda at its worst!,"This video is shameless in its exploitation of the fear of rock & roll music. Think ""Reefer Madness"" for rock. The worst part is, when they talk about how evil the lifestyles of the rock starts are, the kid is looking at a BILLY JOEL ALBUM!!!!! C'mon, at least pick Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath or someone with a darker image, but Billy Joel? HAHAHAHAHA"
2,A good read for latin americanists,"Story of a 19th century Scots fraudster, Gregor MacGregor and his scheme to make a fortune selling land in a non existent country in central America. The tale is an interesting one covering the MacGregors exploits in the Americas (where he fought alongside Miranda and Bolivar) and Europe as well as in Britain. Ultimately MacGregor is presented as being a deluded fantasist rather than an outright conman but more judicious editing (especially of the independence campaigns MacGregor actually fought in) with a greater use of footnotes might make it both more useful to historians and efficient to read. Such editing would make it ***"
3,Item not as described,Description indicates that this battery is compatible with the 8610 - It is not. Battery is different size and will not mount to 8610 at all.
5,Doesn't Get Much Better Than This...,"What a great CD! If you like Sinatra and you appreciate peppy lounge music, then you'll love this CD. Perfect for rolling down the windows and taking a long drive. Some of his ""catchy-est"" tunes are on this CD. You'll be humming this for days. What a classic..."
4,YOU'VE HEARD THAT SONG BEFORE,"A very uneven recording from FRANK and BILLY MAY who treated us royally with COME FLY WITH ME and COME DANCE WITH ME.How could they miss on classics like ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET and THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC goes beyond me.I LOVE YOU is possibly the worst song FRANK recorded in the CAPITOL years.Who choosed YES INDEED ! and that gospel atmosphere that seems unfit for SINATRA?On the positive side,i like ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE,FIVE MINUTES MORE and AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE a lot because they are easy to take songs that are fun to listen.Let's settle for a contractual obligation that the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD had to deliver before leaving CAPITOL;after all singing is also a job.I have the feeling somehow that someone will remind me that FRANK's worst song is THERE'S A FLAW IN MY FLUE(but it had a wonderful melody)"
2,Don't cover the compleate title subject,"How to shoot and sell sports photography is not what the title suggest. The subject is shooting Collage sports, not how to get in to the games and who to sell to? The author must be an established sports photographer for a news service or newspaper and as the sell part of the book fall way short...."
3,Material needs updating,"Overall an OK book, an easy read, lots of helpful information but much of the material is somewhat out of date and relates a lot to film, even going so far to say on page 32 that someday ""film based cameras may be as obsolete as manual typewriters""...was hoping for more actual technique discussion, but nonetheless a nice addition to my photography library."
2,Neophytes can pick up some photo and business tips,"I don't think this book quite lives up to its billing. It would better have been called how to shoot college football and soccer. The informational sections and pictures on these sports are good. Cycling coverage is not bad. Baseball info is OK but the shots appear to have been made at poorly attended high-school games. The author is not bad on cycling; superficial to poor on tips for shooting things mildly offbeat, like water sports, golf, tennis, horse sports and wrestling. Judging by the hairstyles, many of the illustrations were made 20 years ago. Business and selling information is OK. Tech info is heavy on pictures of Canon long lenses. The formulas for pushing b&w film to very high speeds were useful."
5,An Extremely useful book for photographers of all levels,"The book gives detailed explanations of how to shoot various sports photos, even what type of lens to use. It emphasizes capturing the emotions, which I wish more sports photographers would do, maybe I would enjoy the sports sections of the newspapers more. Mr. Arndt displays many creative and timely photographs in his book. Many of the tips can be used in any action type photography, not just sports."
3,Leviton GFI Dual Outlet,"I looked for a company that didn't make it's products in China for many reasons I am not going to get into. I saw that Leviton made their products in North America i.e Canada, Mexico and the US so I ordered. When I received it I was so disappointed to find out this had indeed been made in China. Thus the 3 stars. The product seems to be working well so far but I have a wait and see attitude as a hugh percentage of products that are made in China get recalled."

1,YOU WILL NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT,100's time I tried to purchase this product.and always give me refund confirmation for my payment amount.it has never completed.at one time I tried to purchase it from alphacraze after I complete the order they sent me a confirmation for replacement lamp.now I made again with a1books in amazon it is return my payment for this resone.I do not beleave thats offer is correct.nobody leave any comment because nobody can buy ittake care.
1,I've been hurt too,"This is not the only Amazon video projector price that is not accurate. I tried to buy a 3m video projector for $464.00 only to be told the same story about it being an Amazon error and that the actual product for sale was a replacement bulb for the projector. Folks, don't get your hopes up. In reality, $311.00 is the cost of a replacement bulb for this product; the real projector sells for much more. Amazon needs to work a little harder to make sure its ads are correct. These errors reflect on the professionalism of Amazon and ruin the public's faith in the company."
1,don't be fooled,"Got this as ""extra"" battery for remote control boat. I also was fooled by amazon thinking this was a spare battery for the boat. Wrong!!! It was the wrong size for the boat. I was charged extra shipping, and we charged the battery so that when my child opened the boat on Christmas he would have a charged battery ready to go. we were both really bummed. Even if this is recommended as an extra battery for your RC don't trust Amazon to know!!!"
1,wrong product sent,"i ordered a extra battery pack at the same time i ordered the remote control boat it appeared to be from the same supplier, the boat and pac were shipped from different sources resulting in double shipping and on top of that they sent the wrong battery pack for the DEFECTIVE BOAT now i have to figure out how to get it corrected,"
5,Harmony for a memorable literary vacation,"If you haven't read all of Philip Gulley's books then you have missed out on true humor and a visit with people you have ""known all your lives""wonderful fall down clean laughing as well as touching moments."
4,Entertaining Elseworlds diversion,"Veering away from the usual superhero meets other company's superhero crossover, DC has Batman meeting up with a real historical figure - Harry Houdini. Although their adventure (they're after a smiling serial killer) is pretty much what is expected, it is the atmosphere and art that makes it memorable. Read this back to back with Gotham By Gaslight and you'll be clamoring for a Batman/Sherlock Holmes crossover."
1,Prima's Official Guide to Seagate Crystal Reports 7,If you are a VB developer and trying to get information to work with the Crystal Report in your VB code. Don't waste your money. There is nothing in the book.
1,A waste of time and money-- I tried to return it.,"Sometimes you make a big mistake-- purchasing this book was one of them. Even the Seagate User Manual does a better job of explaining concepts. If this is the one and only ""official guide"", I am sadly dissappointed. The author(s) should have spent more time understanding who uses Crystal Reports and writing the book to that market-- this is so far off of the track it's de-railed."
2,save your money,The book is basically a series of screen shots and only deals with the very basics. Not even a good section on formulas. I think it might help if you have no knowledge whatsoever...after a few days it is useless
2,Don't spend your money on this one.,"Don't spend your money on this one. The user's manual is much better. Also, Seagate's web-site offers tons of information this book doesn't begin to touch on, including user's manual and technical manuals you can download in pdf format."
1,Needs work,"If you are looking for a developer's reference, this book is not for you. It covers what the documentation covers and barely puts a little more content then the Dummie's books on the same subject. Keep this one on the shelf."
3,Very Shallow and few examples,"I started a new job that required me to jump right in and learn CR7 quickly and to understand reports already created. This book does an OK job of introducing what CR is and what it can do, but it gives very few examples and the info is very shallow to take you very far."
1,Big Disapointment,"Big, Big, Big Disapointment. I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book with the hopes that it would help with many issues not covered in the Crystal Reports Manual. Unfortunately, this book was a big disapointment as I found it to be very similiar in content to the Crystal Reports Manual. Of the 50 plus computer books I have purchased from Amazon.com, this is the only lemon."
4,Good Reference Book,"Though it doesn't cover every area of Crystal Reports in great depth, who has time to read that many pages anyway? This book is an excellent reference for those of us getting our feet wet with Crystal, without overburdening us with lots of pages we'll never read. I like that it had good tips scattered throughout the book and I am recommending it to the Crystal users I have to support as a software developer."
2,Rather disappointing - Seagates own manuals are better,"I was quite disappointed with this book. It may be OK for beginners who want something a bit more substantial than a Crystal For Dummies, but Seagate's own manuals give more extensive explanations and clearer examples. Fifteen pages on subreports as opposed to 6 1/2 in this book. Save your money for one of the forthcoming references."
4,A good supplement to the Crystal Reports documentation,This book is a good alternative or supplement to the Crystal Reports documentation. It provides a friendlier approach to learning to use the powerful features that make Crystal Reports a leading reporting tool. One area where this book could be better is its coverage of running Crystal Reports on the web.
5,Worth the money and the wait.,Even though I have used Crystal from Ver 2 this reference still gave me some useful tips. Also it explained some of the concepts that were in the help screens but in a much clearer manner (with screen shots). A very good A to Z guide without the indepth treatment of all Crystal's features. I am still waiting for the Complete reference to be published but given the lack of published material available it is worth the money.
5,Must have for support staff and end-users alike!,Being on the support staff of an industry leading software company this book has proven to be an excellent tool.
2,"Great record (5 Stars), poor digital mastering (2 Stars)","Don't be fooled by the ""24-bit Digitally Remastered"" hype Capital is promoting with these releases. Reprise's Sinatra catalog on CD has done a much better job of preserving the sound of the original record, which is closer to the master tape than these abominations. Bob Norberg (Capital mastering engineer) went to great lenghts to supress the tape hiss, which in turn sucked the life out of these recordings. The result is a flat and dimensionless sound as if a blanket had been thrown over your speakers. If you just want the music and care about the sound, then look for a used copy of the earlier pressing of this CD..."
5,Perfection!,"I have most all Sinatra albums, going back to Dorsey. A number of reviews believe the ""concept"" albums, like Only the Lonely and Wee Small Hours, put Nice ""N"" Easy to shame. Not in my book. I feel Nice ""N"" Easy is one of Sinatra's all time best albums---gorgeous songs, gorgeous arrangements, gorgeous singing. A must have for any Sinatra fan."
5,Sinatra makes me happy,"Nothing will ever replace ""In the Wee Small Hours"" as my favorite Sinatra (if not my all time favorite recording), this one scores very high on the scale. I prefer the quiet, sad songs that Sinatra did so well after a failed love affair. I play them to go to sleep at night (although I've been married for 50 years & am still happy I married my husband). But, if you like wonderfully melodic and painfully sincere recordings, first buy ""Hours"" and then order ""Nice 'n' Easy"". You will love them."
3,"Magnificant, but uneven.","This is a Sinatra album that at one time was one of my favorites, but it hasn't held up as well as most of his others. There's some of Franks best work here. Fools rush in is a classic.That Old Felling and You go to my Head are as good as it gets and How Deep is the Ocean is arguably Frank in his finest voice. (Okay, so maybe this album deserves 4 stars). But some of the other tracks are so trite I can no longer listen to them -- no wonder, 2 of them have lyrics by Ira Gershwin. ""Embrace me, you sweet embracable you -- you irreplacable you."" Come on! ""I got a crush on you sweetie-pie. All the night hear me sigh."" Yuk! Even Frank can't make that work. Mam'selle and Dream don't fair much better even though Frank and Nelson do it as well as it can be done. If shmaltz doesn't bother you, give this album a try, if for nothing else, to hear Sinatra in his hey-day. But unless you have 7 or 8 other albums which are better, hold off on this one for a while."
2,Okay Episode,"This episode was Okay, not one of the best episodes, however it did have a real good plot to it: Dax is accused of a crime that Curzon Dax (a previous host) commited but it turns out that he did not do it"
4,Attractive,"Received as a Christmas present. I agree with the other reviewers... this does look more expensive than its purchase price and is of heavy weight. I love it. Can't speak to durability as it's only a couple days old. I believe the Amazon warranty is 5 years, so if it aligns with quality, I'm set. I would recommend to a friend."
3,The Do It! book is highly abridged.,"I was disappointed in the accompanying book - it's a little hard to follow, especially for a child. Otherwise the recorder is fine for a learning instrument."
3,Shaft is oversized!,"These kinds of tools, like my Starrett wiggler, etc., are usually made a tenth or two undersized so they fit in a standard .375"" tool holder. Not this one: it's .3752"", which means I have to either return it or make a custom tool holder (I did the latter, but why should I have to?).I like my other Starrett tools, but this was a disappointment."
5,this is an incredible cd....a must have for your collection,"I just listened to the Pam & Dodi CD again....I really love it and have not been able to take it out of my cd player...the tracks are hot, their vocals are crazy, and listening to it gets me ready for whatever the day brings. The songs ""Don't Have To"", ""What's Wrong,"" ""For Me, For You,"" ""Gotta Give it Up"" and ""Forgive Me"" are my favorites. I would definately recommend it!!!!!"
5,Schorr scores big!,"This is a beautiful book. Schorr's work is beyond good. He's an artistic master changing the LA art scene with his cartoon-realism masterpieces. Perhaps even changing the world's art scene. He has destroyed old fine art constrictions, and modern art snobbery. He's my hero!"
4,Nicely done video,"This video is a good one to purchase if you are curious about pow wow dancing or wish to see what other dancers are doing. Also, you get to check out the dance clothes of others and see other styles. It is a good length (60 minutes) and the narration is nice. I would recommend it, but be sure to use it as a guide only, and listen to what your friends and family say regarding dancing also."
4,black sabbath's electric funeral!!!! gotta have it,well few bands can cover the almighty black sabbath this well I personally don't like iced earth much but they can surly hit a home run with electric funeral few can capture the mood this well!A+ for the cover B- for the rest but i'm not a fan.
5,My autistic boys love it!,"My twins have autism, one loves the computer and has great fine motor skills, the other is afraid of the 'monster light' and stays away from it, until we purchased the SW:Early Learning Activity Center! Now they both love to play with it, print out puppets, act out shows, and yell out thier colors just like in the game. The games are very simple, the colors are fantastic. It is simple enough for my son to run it by himself, and not become frustrated."
3,Star Wars Early Learning,"My children really like this game, but different levels would have been great. The game is pretty simple for them to play."
4,Great magazine!,This magazine always has interesting and exciting articles! Packed with training tips and good experiences for the novice and seasoned pilot. Great buy.
1,Global Warming alarmists unite!! Pilots look elsewhere...,"If you are a global warming alarmist and a big fan of Al Gore, then this Bonnier publication is for you. Everything in Bonnier magazines it seems is colored by the lens of Al Gore and the AGW crowd. If you are a pilot or prospective pilot, or you're just a fan of aviation, you can do much better than this magazine. If however you love one sided indoctrinations into the AGW movement, then by all means go for it."
4,"Sweet, Sweet Story!","On their wedding day, Jacob and Leah pack up and head to Montana, full of hopes and dreams for a future together. Life is wonderful as they begin homesteading their plot of land. When tragedy strikes, Jacob begins to wonder whether he will ever have his sweet wife back, or will he be married to a stranger.Follow Jacob and Leah's path through the early years of their marriage as they struggle to find God's will for their life together.Although set in 1878, this story tells a tale that those of us living in 2005 can relate to. If you are a fan of historical romance, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. A must read for Janette Oke fans! - Cynthia M. Hickey, author of Pursued By Evil and A Dream Fulfilled"
3,"Good, deep story, game bug-ridden","The story is really good in this one, the mood, sounds, videos, they're all good. Also, the story is extensive, but I don't know what is the end of the story, because this game is ****** full ****** of bugs: produces a lock-up on my computer every 5-10 minutes (I have lots of games that run without problems)."
4,I really need help,"I need help.......i really like this guy at my school, and i really would like to know what it's like to be in love! i really wanat hom to fall in love with me, i'm only 13, i'm not stupid, i kinda know what i'm doing, but if anyone could please please send me a spell i could perform on him you would make my dream come true, just as long as i don't have to cut someone's liver out, please help me."
2,make a guy drink the liver of a black cat? I don't think so,"My friend bought this book and we could only do about 5 of them cuz most of them require things like liver of a black cat, cat eyes, etc. So my advice to you is save your money and buy a different book."
2,eee.. some useful stuff,"namely the section on goddesses of love, gods of love and on herbs - butr all in all not worth the shelf space.the spells and amulets included - one or two i found worth trying.whole section on weirdo spells from old grimoires that she herself says call for ingredients impossible (not to mention yucky) to obtain. so why the hell are they in there? as items of curiosity? that's not what i wanted to have when i bought this book.."
2,huge,"Thankfully the dimensions of this case are posted now, so you can see that it's way bigger than any palm PC. The picture is deceiving -- it looks as though a PDA sits in the case snugly and comforably. In reality, there's 1/3 of empty space and the thing is so thick you can't put it in any pocket (so much for ""pocket PC"").For women who have large purses, it's a good space saving solution though, because you could put your regular wallet stuff in there in addition to the PDA.For guys trying to use the beltclip (held by velcro) is cumbersome. It attaches vertically and creates an enormous budge on your hip, making it look like you have something way more dangerous in this ""holster"" than your PDA (that's particularly funny when you have a suit jacket on).The leather is okay (it's no Fossil though) and the padding is adequate. BUT, unless your PDA is 5.5x3.5, do not buy this case. I am returning mine and getting something smaller."
2,NO ORIGINAL VERSIONS,"This CD appeared like it was a good collection of songs, but NONE of them are the original versions. It should be assumed that any collections or greatest hits album contains the originals, not remakes, but the product description made no mention of this. A real disappointment."
4,Another master class in acting out the lyrics perfectly...,"I think Frank's half-dozen or so ""broken heart"" LP's represent his highest quality work, and this one ranks just a hair below ""In the Wee Small Hours"" and ""Only the Lonely."" Of course, as a fan, I also like his six best ""hat"" albums, those bright and swinging affairs. But the subtle selling of these lovelorn lyrics, recordings in which his silences and his breathing are as vital to success as his enunciation of each word, is something to behold. I keep it one star below the two more famous efforts mentioned earlier because those songs, overall, seem more powerful to me. For all his personal (and personality) troubles, Sinatra is THE American singer of the 20th century. Here, a man with an inadequate formal education, a dysfunctional family of origin, and a low amount of voice and musical training, shows what ""talent"" might mean: a mysterious coming together of instinct, experience and effort that defies explanation."
4,Good reference for weight training exercisers,"I found this book to be a useful reference in my weight training program. Cory gives good examples of many exercises, from beginner to advanced. I find her exercises more similar to mens than any other women's fitness book I've read. Because of this, it is most useful for the advanced weight lifter. One draw-back is that the publication date is old (1991). I would love to see Cory update this book in the near future. Overall, a great book."
3,"Not the best, but very great potential for more","The blade trilogy of movies were a good series, and who wouldn't want to try a tv series. This film is the pilot episode of the TV series. This show is reminicent of the Highlander TV series spawned from the Highlander movies. I didn't care much for the TV series at first, but then the storyline really pulled together and it became good. I see the same from this series. I was not really impressed by it, but it definitly and most likely will get better. I will keep watching when I can, and expect it to get better. Check it out, definitely peaked my interest."
3,"""Unrated"" is a matter of opiniom","While I personally enjoyed watching the show on Spike, it did not surprise me when it was cancelled, although I wished we as the fans had gotten 1 more Season for it to be more fleshed out. This DVD seems to be a way for New Line to test the waters and see if there is still enough support for the series that a full release of it could happen, which I am hoping for. My only man beef with this DVD is the fact that this was the exact same thing shown UNCUT when Spike first aired it. I think the only thing from memory from that time and watching this DVD that I actually saw ""unrated"" and different was the fact the tattoo scene had the woman getting up with her big breasts exposed.Wow... that was the ""Unrated Extended Version Too Graphic for TV"", which aside from the 5 second full frontal nudity was the exact same ""uncut"" version when it first aired and played during the late night for Spike. Worth a pick-up for the fans, but wait for the TV Set if it happens."
4,Good,"The guy that said the fan didn't like is must be insane..or blind. Go check we and you can read forums for the fans that actually what they are mad is because Blade was not aired anymore, about the poor ratings thats a stupidy since what good things brings spiketv? reapeating and reapeting movies that people own or dont care anymore."
3,"This is not the entire series, FYI !","I love Blade in the movies, but I personally felt the TV series was better than the movies. The character development was just better, IMHO, & I learned to like the new Blade better than Wesley Snipes' version. I am only giving this 3 stars, though, because it is not the full series. This is only the premier with a bunch of extras. It's worth it to die hard fans, but just an FYI that this is not the full series."
1,Problems in DVD and Problems with Descriptions,"I really like the Blade TV series as short-lived as it was. When I saw this DVD I thought maybe I'd missed a movie that came out after the series, the information here on Amazon and on the DVD itself suggested this was a stand alone movie.It is NOT. It is the pilot episodes for the series. So if you are getting the DVD of the series, don't get this.Also be warned that these two episodes or pilot movie has some serious problems with how they are formatted and it appears to be on purpose. While I could get the other episodes to play on my computer and any of the DVD players in our house, the first two episodes, this ""movie"" would only play on certain machines. Very annoying."
1,Buyer Reware,Ok I liked the TV series and was immensely saddened by its demise but what can you expect from a 3rd rate TV network. My rating is for this DVD and not the show itself because this DVD is ONLY the pilot yes thats right folks they put out only the pilot. I was so looking forward to rewatching the one and only season of the show and my rating reflects my dissapointment.
2,BLADE - House of Chthon,"THE CHANGE IN LEAD ACTOR HURTS THE MOVIES STORY LINE, BECAUSE THEY ALSOHAVE NO CHARACTORS TO CONNECT THIS MOVIE TO ALL THE PREVIOUS BLADE MOVIES.THE MOVIE IS GOOD BUT I SEE NO CONNECTION TO THE PREVIOUS MOVIES EXCEPT THE TITLE ( BLADE )."
4,Enjoyable Series,"I happened to catch the Blade marathon on Spike TV and I loved the show. It was fast-paced and I thought it did translate well. It wasn't the gore fest of the movies, but it was slick and adult. I was saddened to see the show go away, so I hope this signals a return of some sort. I still think Spike TV gave up on the show too quick."
3,Blade: House Of Chthon,this is only the two first episodes in the blade series put together to make a movie. it's okay i wouldn't waste my money on it. i would just buy the series on dvd. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't just get the complete sereis then you'll have it
2,Became better later on,"After watching this Pilot I was a bit disappointed, Blade was not the cool guy you remember from the movies, not acted very well either. Still I hung on because I saw someting I liked and as the series progressed it got better, but that was too late after 1 season it got cancelled with a bit of a cliffhanger."
1,fake blade,this movie can never be compared to wesley snipes Blade. The fight scenes and everything else is lousy in comparison
2,Took Too Long,It took a long time to receive this movie. I emailed the vendor and it did show but I was very unhappy with how long it took me to receive product. It took almost close to a month.
1,Chasing not smoke but meaning,"This may be the most confusing book I've ever read. It isn't thatthere isn't useful information in it, it's just it's scattered, repetitious, and intermixed with large blocks of what I assume Mr. Pyne thinks is relevant philosophy. You'll find yourself skipping over a great many paragraphs of this last.The other major failing it that, while the author devotes a great deal of (scattered) space to his criticisms of existing wildfire control practices, he never makes clear what methodology he is in favor of.Save your time and money and skip this one. I wish I had."
1,Doesn't Run on Windows 7,I took a chance on this excellent game from years ago but have to report total failure to get it to work. It did install on a Windows 7 machine and would run the intro and opening menu but didn't function after that no matter what Windows 7 adjustments I made.I used to run this years ago on Windows 98 but it doesn't work on today's operating system.
1,Game blows,"GTA IV was a huge disapointment got bored after playing for 30 minuted, nowhere near as engaging as the past ones and the characters aren't all that appealing or likable."
1,This game sucks,"This game is not worth buying. I'm not even sure if this game is worth renting. If you have played GTA San Andreas it is pretty much the same thing. It's a sequel so I guess it should be. There just aren't enough new things in this game to justify purchases.If you have never a GTA, then you should rent it and see how the gameplay is. You pretty much drive from one location to the next and complete missions...kinda of boring missions too."
4,great game,"to be honest, this is the only game that I own for my ps3. the reason? well I like the Nintendo games.... but this game is something else, I was sure that it'll be awesome, and it is...el único juego que tengo para mi ps3, porque me gustan más los juegos de Nintendo, pero estaba seguro de que sería genial este juego, y lo es."
2,Overhyped and boring,"I'm not a huge GTA fan and never will be but that didn't stop me from playing Rockstar's latest entry which got perfect 10's from online sites. However after about 30 minutes into it I was completely bored and detached. Yes, there are some new innovations like dating girls, etc. but as a game it didn't make the experience any more compelling than San Andreas. Graphics are of course better but it doesn't change the fact that there is low replay value and a really gullible/lame protagonist. Why anyone would want to run around carjacking and shooting people with this awful character is beyond me. Save yourself the trouble and buy a better game."
2,I've had nightmares that resembled this game,"Walking around a city full of people who are all the same person, react the same way, tons of buildings and stores but they're actually just cardboard sets.I cannot believe such an unfinished game was put out at such a high price on two new great high end gaming systems. Did they fire the people that worked on San Andreas? This game is empty and depressing to play, the characters are annoying morons, the controls and physics are AWFUL, the shooting is boring after 5 minutes and NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS GAME AT ALL.I have about 13 hours playing time clocked and a good handful of missions completed and its THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER, its pitifully dull. I was really shocked at the lack of content and wish I bought something else. Speaking of such past being able to play PS1&2 games and MGS4 there isn't anything worth looking at on the PS3, should've gotten an Xbox360, or a Wii."
4,GTA,"Not an avid gamer, but I enjoyed this title a lot. It does get old after a while of consistant use, but if you own an expensive gaming system chanses are you have other games for it."
5,4.5 Great Game! (PS3 Version),"Really have enjoyed this game over the passed couple years. Single player has givin' me hours of fun whether i'm following the story and completing missions or just roaming the city acting like a maniac. The multiplayer's been a source of a lot of fun too. My main complaints about the multiplayer is there is no main lobby to search for open games. Your just entered into games at random. And that can be annoying if there's not a lot of people online. It'll keep entering you into games with 1 or 2 people when you'd prefer a game with 16. Another problem is the police. Sometimes they can be very overwhelming. And unlike all the PS2 Gta games, there is no cheat to turn police off. Why not? How hard could it be to allow a simple cheat? And there isn't as varied exploration as in GTA SA. 4 is basically all urban NYC. Where as SA had plenty of different terrains. Still a great game overall. Would def recommend"
3,Goood game,"Old game, but it is still fun to play. Kinda makes you sick after a while from all the spinning around. If you stick to driving the cars you won't get sick. Walking inside the buildings gives me motion sickness."
4,Back to Liberty City - GTA: IV,"What can I say? I am a fan of the series. Awesome game like always with a rich detail in graphics and realism. However I guess for the increase in graphics was the drawback in content. I was a little disappointed by Rockstar direction with this game, unlike GTA: San Anderas. The remove contents like customizing your vehicle or flying a hijack plane, ughh!! I guess the nature of the 9/11 attacks and taking planes and crashing them into buildings unintentionally, would be a sore reminder. But should have give something back to the games in terms of content, however this is a good game all-in-all and shouldn't deter anyone from trying the game out. After all, they did add content like playing video games WITHIN a game and watching television too! Eagerly await the next sequel..."
4,GTA IV,"The missions aren't as good as San Andreas, or even Vice City, but Its still a decent game.Pros:- Its GTA. Free-roam games always win.- Lots of cool new features (like watching tv, internet browsing, calling friends to hangout, etc.)- Online can be fun.- The detail added (like locked car doors, and visible car damage to a specific area).Cons:- Most of the main characters are pretty boring, which kills storyline interest.- They tried to make the game more ""realistic"", but it in turn made formerly fun task like killing bystanders or fighting with the police into something you DON'T want to do. What I mean specifically is that the police are too aggressive. One star warrants no longer get you a nightstick beat-down by cops, but instead turns straight to gun fire if you try to escape.- Protagonist character Niko is way too slow when performing actions.- Some people are like Zombies. I've never played a game where I had to shoot someone so many times.. Unless they were a zombie!"
2,ehhh,the game is ok..the best graphics of any GTA game to date but definitely NOT san andreas..storyline sucked but still worth the 20 bucks i guess
4,GTA4,"Fun game for adults. Good map size, great missions, and side missions, bowling, pool, etc. Nice selection of cars and fun dialog."
4,"Good fun, good, graphics","I love the game, and the story provides some cool new aspects. It didn't have as much as San Andreas (bicycles, etc) but the gameplay is great and the graphics are stunning, considering how much there is of the city. I definitely recommend the game."
2,Stupid Game,"Can barely control the character. Cars wobble around the road like rowboats. Can't fight. Have to walk (run in slow motion) for 10 minutes at a time to get to the next mission (or usually to get back to the start of the mission that you have to repeat like 500 times). One tiny mistake and you have to repeat the entire 4 hour mission all over again, infinitely. Really stupid game. Wanna get laid? Go on Craigslist. Wanna play a fun game? Find something else."
2,Boring GAme,I highly recommend that people rent this game before buying. I honestly dont get why its rated so high. I was so bored while playing this. The controls are difficult and when you walk the screen always jumps to the wrong direction. Fighting multiple opponents is so awkward. I stopped playing it because i was so bored. I first had to pick up some girl and take her bowling. Then after that i had to take my cousin to a strip club where you have to fight multiple opponents. It wasn't fun at all. It also froze on me a couple of times and I had to try to restart the ps3.
2,"Sweet graphics, BORING GAME!","OK, bought this game last week, been playing it......and I gotta admit, the graphics are spectacular (really), I ain't crazy about this game....WAY TOO MUCH HYPE for a feeble attempt at a game. I'll take GTA Vice City ANY DAY OF THE WEEK!The good:> Awesome graphics> Cool carsThe bad:> Cars are impossible to control! (Slam into everything!!!!)> Hard to see the game (Lighting sucks)> Extremely boring gameplay> Camera angles suck> Fighting & punching SERIOUSLY SUCKS> Music stations SUCK! (ONE Rock station??????) COME ON!> Control/Joystick issuesYou would think by now, with ALL the technology we have, that video game companies could make the punching & fighting a bit better? COME ON! Is that too much to ask?"
2,i liked this game at first but now iam getting board of it,"I liked this game when i first brought and played it but then i relized its just the same like the other gta games. All you do is run around do what you want carry weapons in your hand shoot people beat up people steal cars the police comes after you and you no the rest. The graphics is nice but that really don't matter its the game play that counts, you can fly a helicopter but the thing is the police just come after you when you fly one and you can't go in not much stores, exept bowling, pool, the bar, clothes store, and thats it. GTA is a really repetive game with the same stuff but different character to play as and different storymode but the rest is the same, so this game is getting boaring not much i really care about this game anymore."
3,Eh... Its Not The Greatest...,"I like the game I cant sit and play it for more than an hour without getting bored. The missions are a little boring, constantly calling people is annoying... I do like flying the helicopter in freemode and shoot people down. I am (ERICHOMER) so if you see me beware I am an airport hound... Also the graphics were jaggy and dotty, I have a 1080p tv I dont know what the game is running at but I wasnt impressed... Overall its a good game no doubt, but it falls short..."
3,Good not a 10 though,"I will not make a very long review and just state some stuff. I bought this game expecting that it will do what san andreas did for games and it failed not miserably just failed. The graphics are the best thing about this game as you should have heard and the character of this game are very bare bone and saying that without any spoilers I didn't like the ending. Everything this game does san andreas did better except for the graphics, and I was kinda dissapointed. I bought this game and then later bought MGS4 and then I stopped thinking GTA4 was a great game just ok. The online plain out sucks and few people are online and considering how much this game sold that should tell you something. I recommend this game slightly since it was still kinda of fun and people who care more about graphics than the other stuff should give it a try."
4,If only real life were this fun...,I wish I could have this much fun in real life! But this lifestyle isnt normal for me- im not italian or from new york.
4,"Love it or hate it, but you can't deny the graphics and depth","I didn't like this gameplay much. I thought there was too much driving and too much useless stuff, like going bowling on a date with a girl. Seriously? Am I seriously going on a date with a virtual girl, going bowling? I'm supposed to be shootin people up and robbing banks!I guess I just felt it was too much like real life, that I should just spend time in real life, not in GTA IV.Give it a whirl, though. These good reviews aren't a fluke."
2,a small warning,"This is just a small warning before buying this game. My husband recently got this game for the PS3, we installed it and had been playing it for several hours but when we turned the system off and back on the message 'data corrupt must restore hard drive' greeted us. This game ruined our hard drive. We don't play a lot of games or 'hack' into our system and when we phoned the game store they said they had 5 other people call in recently. I wish they told us before we bought this game.So there's a warning to you guys, the game is good - if you can get it to play. After reading forums some people say the game only freezes or stops their console from reading discs any more. By the way, Xbox 360 also has similar problems."
3,"Good, but doesn't live up to the expectations","This is a good game overall. But when you're used to the development of the series, after Vice City and San Andreas, you would have thought that GTA4 would've been a much better game. It seems they sacrificed more time on the graphics engine, than making the game actually fun.You can see my full review at:[...]"
4,I Have Had Enough Of Liberty City!,"This makes my 3rd trip to liberty city,GTA3, Liberty City Stories & Now GTA4, not including GTA on GBA, GTA on PS one. I GET IT, I may be biased being a CA native but I could care less about New York. Why not switch up the scenery with Philly? Same-ish accent and different scenery. Overall this game is pretty fun, the multiplayer is surprisingly FUN. The story and graphics are awesome, I am just SICK TO DEATH of Liberty City. Also I was a little surprised to notice this game lacked some of the depth that San Andreas had with the gambling, safe houses, vehicle mods, lack of airfield, less boats, no skydiving, slower cars & the soundtrack on this GTA doesn't hold a candle to San Andreas. The story line is still typical GTA flair, there were a few times I laughed very hard and groaned in discomfort but it was a fun ride. If you don't own it buy it, especially with it being around $20 it is well worth it."
5,Great,"Well its a good game as always with GTA. The best one ever. Love it, love it, love it...Hate that some of cheats arent there anymore"
3,good,"expected more from it was very disapointed with that lack of features. GTA San Andreas was a step forward, this is a step back."
4,Another good GTA game,Every thing abut this game is superb. It is more emotionally involved than the years before. The only thing I wish is that you could walk into more of the buildings that are in the city.
2,grand theft auto 4,"This game is fun but really disapointing due to the fact they game states that you rarely ever see the same people twice which isn't true. the cars are limited that you don't have much of a selection and you can't fly a plane which is a huge disapointment not only that, you can't even go into the airport. you can't enter most bulidings but grand theft auto claimed you could. it doesn't live up to anything they said. they still have a long way to go."
4,Still Playin A Month Later!,"To us, that is the sign of a good game. If it holds their interest for more than a few weeks and they can't ""Beat It"" after a few sessions. Definately worth the $60 for my older teenage sons. We preordered it and it came to our door the morning of the release!"
3,Not fun anymore,"I guess I am just getting old but this franchise is not fun anymore. My biggest complaint is horrible mechanics (controlling the character when on foot is even MUCH more clumsy than to drive a car), although improved but still bad shooting system, and (what drives me physically tired of the game very quickly) the terrible camera which is fixed behind the character and which keeps turning right and left as you walk. After playing Metal Gear with the wonderful polished character movement and camera mechanics, I just can't make myself play this one.Most of the other bad things from the previous games are still here (ridiculous save system, the necessity to drive long for your mission objectives, etc.)If you were getting tired of the series and were hoping that this installment would spark your interest again, you probably should just wait for Resident Evil 5."
3,good but not too good,"the game is realy good but its not as good as san andreas you dont have jet planes nor ur jet pack or the parachoot,the cars are realy sexy and the graphics."
3,Pretty Disappointed,"GTA has always been my favorite game franchise. Vice City is my favorite game. I was highly anticipating GTA IV. That said, it didn't do it for me.The graphics and gameplay were great. The story was a bit long and I didn't ever feel a connection to the characters. In fact, most games I get I play through at least twice. I only played this through once because doing it again just seemed overwhelming; too much of a time commitment. Additionally, the game is serious, something GTA was never really known for. The missions and activities weren't really fun, they were just tasks to be done.I know a lot of people feel the same way as I do. Hopefully Rockstar listens and brings the fun back (and good music for the radio stations)."
1,+++ABOMINATION+++,"I thought halo 3 was over hyped but gta 4 redefines the concept. There is no way this game deserves the landslide of perfect scores it has recieved, and the only reasonable conclusion is that the reviewers were paid off. The gameplay is the same as ever and it gets very repetitive and dull. drive to point a. shoot some dude. drive to point b. repeat ad nauseum. The story is a complete joke where they throw in every gangster cliche and rascist sterteotype in the book. Includes numerous lame, banal attempts at satire. Nico Bellic has the personality of a cardboard box, save yourself the trouble and watch scarface instead. And the graphics are seriously sub-par. The characters are super blocky and look like something from the original xbox or ps2, textures are bland, and overall its pretty unimpressive. Unless you have a thing for the demoiselles d'avignon you are not going to find the strippers here attractive. dont be fooled by the press. save your cash."
1,Grand Theft of My Time =* (,"This game just pissed me off!!!! I pre-ordered it, took several days off of work so I could play it, I have been a huge Grand theft auto fan since the originals(yes the corny ones when you have the helicopter view and it looks like cell phone games). But after a week of playing I just stopped, I was bored and had absolutely no desire whatsoever to continue to play it. I have yet to finish the game and as of writing this review I have yet to pick the game back up since a week after its release!"
1,Game for PS2 Console not PS3,"I was so disappointed with the graphics, looks like your playing on a PS2 Console. AI is not that Realistic too."
1,Don't Buy Until Rockstar Fixes Freezing Issues,On my 60GB machine Grad Theft Auto IV keeps freezing and now won't even load. Even after following Rockstar's instructions on the problem the game keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop while loading the last saved point. Don't buy until Rockstar provides a patch. No other game on my PS3 has had a problem.
1,"Great game, too bad it locks up!","The game seems real fun, but it is unplayable because it locks up constantly. I have even heard reports that after playing this game, some people have experienced lock ups on other games, so it could be that this game fries your PS3. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME until the lockup issues have been resolved."
3,Next Gen NOT...,"The games OK. Flying at night is cool and it's that virtual world, but the multiplayer is lame, guns aren't very pronounced, shooting and driving aren't perfect in any way, it's not streamlined. It's like one big demolistion derby. A week or two to rent it and that's being nice. The lead character is a Bosnian refugee, why? No way this game is a 10. With all the things you can do in the game a 9 for some people for others a 8. Graphics aren't in the least Next Gen or is the gameplay. People thought San Andreas was great. I thought that was just OK. I guess these GTA honks don't get tired of punching anyone for no reaason or killing them without a thought. It's fun for about a day to do that. Seems like a rent to me. Going to a strip club to get a lap dance, maybe the little pimply kids buy it for that. I prefer the real McCoy. COD4 is a 10, this game? Psst, please!"
4,Great game ended too soon,"this was a great game with much needed improved graphics, detailed cars, bodies, the funniest part about this game is when you get by a car, its like a real life situation lol its funny, but back to the details, this version is much shorter than the previous games in the GTA franchise, there's alot of fun in the cities alone, strip clubs, bars(which are extremely fun warning: dont drink and drive you will regret it but its fun), the comedy shows which includes one of the most entertaining person on television today, Katt williams, and they have a tv with actually show's to watch, the game overall including missions are very fun, they way you decide to play this game and the desicions you make depict the way the story ends. how will you play as niko bellic"
3,nice to rent,just rent it.... shooting cops gets old. I beat this game in just 2 weeks. I have yet to play it again.
1,is it?,"is this game a disk or download?it hasnt got shipped yet.....i really dont want a download, so please tell me asap if it is a disk"
2,Lame,"Impressive images, kinda neat how they game-ified the entire city of New York. But the game is BOOOOOOOOORRRRRRING!!!"
2,GTAbore,"Basically, GTA3 with graphics that are a bit better. Same old same old. Definitely not worth the hype, and not a perfect 10."
2,rockstar needs to get their stuff together,They lacked stuff from 3 and San Andreas - They need better AI too. Overall not bad but i wouldn't spend 89.99 on the special addition hell i might not even buy the game if i could do it all over again - just gamefly it
4,Spoiled,"A very good game but perphaps I`ve been spoiled by its precursors... by the fact that there is nothing outstanding from the previous generations of the game, the only difference to me is the storyline incredible graphics online connectivity and everything that this platform offers but other than that more of the same!"
4,"Large, to say the least.","Mostly everyone I know loves it, and the proof is out there on why the great responses. For me, this title was moreso the title to end it for me with enjoying this style of gameplay. Seeing that I've done this more than TWICE durring high school on the older games of this series, I wasn't astounded with its then-horrible (and possibly still?) frame rate long enough to keep at it past a few missions. I did like getting drunk and playing darts, though.But if this series has had you since the begining, then by all means, get this game. You'll even be going online and getting yourself a few trophies out of that way if you really wish to chose so. As for me, I never played it long enough to try out the online. I hear ""Cops and Robbers"" is pretty fun.All and all, It's a good game, especially so if the series is still new to you. Go at it and have yourself a ball."
2,good purchase,i purchased this game for my son we recieved it a few days before the delivery schedule i will definently buy again this is my 5th purchase from amazon and i will keep buying from this website...good seller my son is happy and i am too . thank you
3,Good game but kind of repetitive,"The game is good, but missions are all alike, if you fail a mission you have to redo everything again (boring!!!), graphics are like ps2 graphics, the car and bike driving are weird, if you like lots of nonsense killing this is the game."
3,Where Are Checkpoints?,"I am about halfway through this game, and having logged 20 hours i can say that it suffers from serious flaws. As amazing as so much of it is, a single problem can detract so much. That problem is checkpoints. I'll go through a 25 minute long mission, and near the end of it i'll crash my car and it will explode. Can i restart from a checkpoint from about 5 minutes earlier? No. I restart all over again. Some mission i do over 5 or 6 times. Being able to beat halo 3 on legendary and call of duty 4 on veteran, i would say i am a very good gamer, and i never have had problems with games. but unless you want to spend way too much time repeating the same missions over and over, i would probably rent this. A great experience, but flawed."
2,"To be honest, dissapointed.",I really expected more from this game after playing San Andreas. This game just feels weird to me. I think ill just stick to san andreas.
2,"great story, horrible gameplay","This is one of those games that makes you suffer through horrible gameplay to enjoy a great story. I spent most of the game (when I could) on foot because of the horrible driving mechanic. How difficult should it be to drive around the corner? Apparently very difficult. I've been told by friends that I shouldn't expect great driving because this isn't a driving game - I guess it's time to remove the ""grand"" and ""auto"" from the title."
1,I never recived the package,I was supposed to gotten this package by the 6th of august and have not got it yetthe person whp was selling this game hs no email contact ..what happrned?
1,Not like the last GTA,It came fast and in good shape. But i was dissapointed because I thought this game would be just like GTA San Anderas but better I was so wrong. Wish i could return but will only get a fraction for what i paid for.
1,Same old thing...,"Worth a rental to see, but if you played this game before on an earlier platform nothing is new...the graphics just get spiced up a little. I've never seen a game franchise spend less effort in making improvements in actual gameplay over the course of a series. Yawn."
3,I espect more for this version,"Es muy buen juego pero para esta entrega esperaba mucho mas.Esta vesion es mas interactiva muy real y le agregaron muchos detalles pero tiene menos armas que las versiones anteriores, no tiene aviones (no se pueden pilotear), menos modelos de elicopteros, menos modelos de motos y a decir verdad demasiado corto, pudieron haber aprovechado mucho mas el espacio que brinda el Blu-ray.Es buen juego y tiene muy buenas graficas ya que esta hecho para 1080p, pero esperaba mucho mas."
3,Not as good as I expected!!!,"GTA4 is a really great game. The reason I gave it such a low review is because it really didn't meet my expectations for being on the brand new consoles. In my opinion san andreas was a way better game then gta4. The only thing that Gta4 has that san andreas doesnt, is better graphics and an online multiplayer. You could do way more things in san andreas that you cant do in GTA4. Still was a fun game though... just hopefully they come out with a better one than this!!!"
3,A Step Backwards,"I have played this for a while now, and I'm bored I'm having to will myself to play it again to give it another chance. I have played all the GTA from the very first to this one, and yes it more real life but that's why I have a front door on my house I open it and there's real life.Cons :No value to exploring the cityWhere are the paramedic missionsWhere are the fire truck missionsRadio Stations are awfulNo variety on the vigilante mission (gun this person down)I haven't found a park car mission or RC mission yetStupid mini games to win over peoplePigeonsDriving the carsWhat happened to the list of cars to steal; now you are told where and when.Dating.All but one missions I have done so far are gun this person down, or deliver this, no lets feed the mafia ice cream and blow the truck upPros:Deciding whether to kill a person on a mission or notGraphics are good but blurryGps good but you don't learn the cityNew cop wanted system"
4,Grand Theft Auto IV PS3,"Overall it's a very fun game. Nice city, the controls and gameplay are a lot more realistic than the GTA games I used to play on PS2."
2,Boring.,"The storyline is quite boring, the missions are repetitive just chase and kill, there is no creative missions like GTA SA had. I will admit the graphics are better, and the game itself is a bit more realistic, but all the more uninteresting."
3,Pleased,My sone was very happy to find that the game came earlier than expected. He enjoys playing the game.I would order from the person again. The game was early and in perfect condition. I was a little unsure about ordering games on line but this is the second time I have order a video game and it works great.
3,"Better graphics, same game","Pretty much the same free roam game we've grown used too since GTA 3, Gets repetitive after a while and the shock value has long run out. Needs more new content, this game did not live up to the hype."
5,Excellent game,This is the first GTA that I play and also the first game on my PS3 which I recently bought... very pleased that I decided to purchase this game.
4,Good fun...,"Great fun, and extremely well written. I loved the characters, and all the voice acting. Missions were compelling, and drove the story forward. Definitely worth playing."
5,The Best Available,"I SIMPLY LOVE GTA 4, m a huge GTA fan, this one being my favourite =)Must have for all the GTA fans, if you're not a GTA fan, i recon you buy this and you'll be a fan =)"
4,Bought the wrong version,"This is a great game, but I bought the wrong version for my husband. I received the item quickly. I don't think I can exchange it, so I am stuck with 2 part IV's."
4,It is what it is!,"The best way to sum up this game is ""it is what it is."" That may sound rather short and empty, but to me if you've played GTA games before then nothing here is going to surprise you. The main character goes around stealing cars and ""working"" for crime bosses in different parts of the city just as in all three previous versions. The differences are limited, and that's a fact whether you want to believe it or not. The graphics are better, they offer some different weapons and cheat codes, and there is a decent multiplayer aspect. However, at the end of about 10 hours playing it, you'll definetly get the feeling you've ""played this before"". I'm not saying its a bad game, it is a solid installment of GTA series, but don't buy it expecting it to be anything more than that. Enjoy."
3,Boring...,"I rented this game to try it out first. Played about 6-7 hours then returned it and have no regret, no desire to play it again. Unlike game reviewers who review games from multiple perspective, I play game solely for one reason: to have fun. And this game is not fun. First few hours were interesting, but soon after it got very repetitive and shooting controls were bad imop."
3,What Do I Do Now?,"first: where are the planes that we can fly?second: why cant i shoot down the planes that are in the games?third: where are the parachutes when my weak chopper is on fire?forth: i beat the game now what? can i take over parts of town? how can i make more money? where can i get gold chains, tattoos , good clothing?If these things are not in the game and if they're not going to have add-ons for it then this game is like part 3(just better visuals).btw..online takes for ever to get in a game(its sweet when you finaly do)rockstar has alot of work do to. i sure hope they are working right now for some downloads."
4,Great Customer Service,When I received the game the included map was in rough shape. After a short email I had a new map sent to me right away!
2,Good... but a step back.,"I have played grand theft auto 4 with the full inclination i would be able to do all that which the great san andreas laid out for the player and more. This would not be the truth. With all the capabilities of the ps3 why did they not make this happen. I played through it thinking the game would redeem itself but really it trudges along taking it self too serious and not having fun like the rest of the GTA family. Worth playing through the story I guess, but I found myself thinking havent I done this before in a more fun way in SA... or even Vice City. I barely made it through the first playthrough and I'm headed back to San Andreas."
2,Meh. Boring game. Adolescent humour. Got old fast.,"I had much higher hopes for this game as I recently completed Red Dead Redemption.. it's the same engine, same design house, similar gameplay. And to me, RDD is at least in the top 3 all-time PS3 games, if not #1.But GTA just bored me to tears! Yes the dialog is edgy. And I cracked up hearing Bas Rutten's voice in it. And there were some other funny parts. But it just got old fast.Overall very well put together game. The cities are very well laid out. But the gameplay itself just didn't do it for me. And the adolescent humour just got to be plain stupid."
4,GTA Next Gen,"So this is what Next Gen GTA is supposed to be? I like it. I love the realism they added from the previous games. Like being able to fly through your window if you hit a wall fast enough, or when you run into a lady carrying bags of groceries they fall and spill. Or when you run in front of a car or get hit by a car you don't just fall down the same way every time, there is great physics behind it. I love this game!"
1,Lack of difficulty levels makes it unplayable for me,"This game is too difficult for me which made the experience frustrating and ultimately unplayable. I see others find it too easy. This could have been easily solved by having 5 levels of difficulty from very easy to very hard. The game would appeal to a much greater consumer base and would have had much greater sales if it had 5 difficulty levels.The other major related problem is that one cannot save in the middle of a mission. Because of this one must repeat the same driving sequence over and over to finally get through the hard part of the mission (ultimately I could not pass missions and had to stop playing the game).Because of the two problems above, I find this game more frustration than fun. I will not buy any more games of this series or any games that do not have levels of difficulty (hopefully 5 levels)."
4,Fun when it is daylight in new york???,The game is really fun. i play it on my 42inch panasonic plasma 1080i tv and the visuals are pretty neat. the only complaint i have is that when the day turns to night it can get impossibly hard to find ones way around the alleys. If it is during a mission it gets almost impossible to spot enemies or chase them cuz you wont be able to see anything. I usually wait for the morning to come but its annoying.
5,I can't stop playing it!,"I've been on the GTA games since it became 3D and always liked how each games progressed. This is no exception, this games tops them all. The gameplay is really fun. You pretty much make things happen on your own by use of your cell phone. From making dates, recieving work, calling for a ride, ect. I'm having a bit of trouble signing to the multiplayer but the single player mode is holding me over until then. If you are a GTA fan then you want to add this to your collection."
4,Excellent Gameplay but...,"First off, the game is super-fun! Isn't that what games are all about? The lack of the 5th star in my review is for the semi-Next-gen graphics on the character models. The city looks amazing but the character models seem like polished versions of the ones from the previous games. The fingers are bulky (I HATE that in games - is it so hard to spend a little extra time on appendages?) and the faces are, with the exception of Niko, just okay. I can't conceive them spending so much time building the gameplay, story, missions, and the city but pretty much ignoring the characters who, for me, are why I am playing.Other than that, this game is a worthy next step in the series. After all, we are still early in the next generation. I imagine the sequels will fix most of the problems I have with the game much like San Andreas did with GTA3."
3,The films of Hopalong Cassidy,"I dont want to write no review whatsoever, but I want only THE FILMS OF HOPALONG CASSIDY. Is that possible ? Ricardo."
3,4x4 dispenser,"I was looking for a low cost 4x4 dispenser and this one fits the bill. It is not durable, but it is light. It is made out of the hard flexible plastic that sock organizers are made of, or about the thickness of a Starbucks cup. It looks like it would last 6 months to a year.Pro: The 4x4's are soft and amenable to facial use. The contents are easily refilled and would be good for travel situations, where weight is a concern.Con: A single 4x4 is a little difficult to grasp thru the 1"" opening and the container moves when you grasp them. If using for a professional counter top solution would recommend ""For Pro Square Pad Dispenser"" ASIN: B0006Q05XU, but the price was right for the Intrinsics dispenser."
2,Kudos to Trovato - SHAME on Alfred Music,"There is a lot of great content in this DVD. Steve is a very gifted player and teacher. However, the production of this DVD and the lack of TAB will make it frustrating to even advanced students who do not read standard notation. If Alfred Music had inserted more chapter markers it would have made it much more user friendly. Steve breaks down the licks very well, but without TAB or a way to quickly return to the top of the lick, it is much slower going than it needs to be. This is an older lesson that was repackaged by Alfred. They should have spent the nominal time and expense to make these lessons accessible to non reading guitarists or clearly marked that it contains no TAB. Tab is the industry standard for stringed instrument instructional material. Alfred took the cheap way out."
2,Be warned,"I read the reviews on this and was prepared but must say even being prepared didn't get me ready. He plays threw the leads to fast and even his slow is fast. Also, it would have helped a lot more if he had put the tabs instead of the music below. I'll take the advice of the other reviews and keep after it but just wanted to let people know if your wanting something that teaches you at a pace you can learn then try something else."
5,Steve is a great instructor in the Nashville style,"A great close up look at 4 power solo verses, broken down so you can follow, and memorize. The sheet music is not tabbed, but that is ok for me I can read somewhat and this practice is just what I needed to explore those higher registers. Reading will help you master these licks much quicker. This level assumes some conversational music knowledge, and even playing at this speed is stretching my abilties. Also some additional open string theory for thought is given. Steve's other vid's I've seen are worthwhile if not to reinforce what you already knew, coming from the expert himself. Great instruction from a good presenter."
2,Broken after 2 weeks?!,"After using these headphones for two weeks, they're broken. I started looking for some nice headphones for work and decided to give these a try. The sound quality is pretty good given you're listening to a good source, but after using them for 2 weeks in my cube at work the left headphone has stopped working. grrrrrr"
2,Stopped working!,"These headphones were very good, while they worked. After using it for about a month, the left speaker stopped working :(I expected better quality from Sony."
3,Boris reveals more but not all,"I'm hungry for Boris's painting technique. The first book of his was enlightening but skipped the critical part of his process, rendering the final product. This book gets closer to revealing his and Judy's magic but still left me wondering how many things are accomplished. It is an essential book for anyone fascinated by Boris and Judy's painting technique just don't expect to be shown how they do everything."
1,genuine sham,"The claim that step by step the artists reveal their secrets is a sham, they reveal nothing, and their text is just airy rap about nothing. The artwork must be their left overs, including several pages devoted to a tedious ad campain for a fruit juice. In addition there are several ridiculous repeated images just for fill out. A shoddy and hastily book put together for self promotion. It's amazing how two such capable fantasy artists dont have the IMAGINATION to put together the genuine article. Buy this only if you are a die hard fan with no sense of discrimination!"
5,Boris/ Bell rulez!,"painting technics and a lot of work, and coposition tips. Its not for beginners , but essential!"
2,Not up to par,"Purchased this tie clip over a year ago. About 2 inches in length, with back about 1.5 inches long. As stated previously, teeth are very sharp, sharp enough to damage ties. Also, due to the clip really only touching in one place, moves around quite easily. However, most disappointed in the finish. Silver wears off rather quickly (mine in less than a month), showing a copper like color. Definitely not made for usage or to last."
4,tie clip is great....,This was a great tie clip that I used for a craft project... Exactly what was advertised and what I needed. Thanks
1,Buyer beware,"When a deal looks too good... well, just realize what you're getting for the money. The plating is wavy and very thin. The teeth on the clip are very sharp, and the whole clamp action is cheap and flimsy."
3,Tie Bar,You get what you pay for. It looks pretty good. But it's designed for wide ties. You can't wear it with skinny ties.The spring is too weak. So the tie bar doesn't stay in one place and it moves around. That's why I give only 3 stars.
4,Essential reference,"This is an essential reference for professional cameramen, and an insightful book for those who want to see some of the ""nuts and bolts""of how a cameraman works. Lots of detail, and extensive discussion of specific cameras and their use."
4,Good,"A fairly, good guide to Cinematography, the fourth edition has many gaps and needs technological update, perhaps the fifth edition will be excellent, specially to students."
5,Get Healthy While Dancing,I purchased this workout set of 3 DVDs because I had been so satisfied with their quality. I had tried 2 of the 3 DVDs by first renting them from Netflix prior to purchasing the package. I've enjoyed watching Bollywood films and thought the dancing looked fun. It really gives you quite a work out.
2,Gag me,I love to do workout videos at home and I am always looking to add to my collection and have greater variety. Hemalayaa seems like she is trying to sell sex more than an actual work out. She gives the camera coy little looks and it kind of gives me the hee-be gee-be's. As far as it getting my heart pumping - just didn't cut it. I also very much dislike it when the directions are voiced over - instead of the people in the video doing the speaking. It makes it harder for me to feel connected.
3,Looks Easy,I have yet to tried the tape. But what I saw it appeared to be easy. I like the music and the fact that you do not have to be an expert in the dance to do it.
3,over priced,"The production was weak and had poor substance, my favorite actors could have used better. A 10 dollar movie at best"
1,"Little information, lots of misinformation","Very disappointing. Perhaps I had the wrong idea of what the book would cover but I had hoped to learn types of learning disabilities and how to deal with them educationally. That is not the scope of this book, despite the title. It does not address LD in depth, test results and their meaning, educational alternatives, etc. My main concern is the misinformation about IDEA federal law and the rights of the learning disabled. Specifically, there is the sentence that states a school evaluation ""can take up to six months or longer."" (p.27). Federal law under IDEA states that the school has 45 days to complete their evaluation after the parent signs the consent. PLEASE don't wait months to have your child evaluated.! The earlier the intervention, the better the outcome. I would not recommend this book."
5,Excellent Read,I read the Day of The Triffids years ago in paperback. I loved the story. It really made you think. I got the collection in hardback and was not disappointed. All his stories are great. These stories are timeless. I highly recommend this collection.
4,Strange presentation of wonderful music,"Extraordinarily beautiful music, but why record companies these days don't tell us on the cover who wrote what piece, I feel irritated and had to once again, go searching on the Internet, as not even Amazon lists the necessary info.This happens so often, and they're new CDs, that it's discouraging as now iTunes is influencing even packaging.Anyway, Ricardo Muti does his ""thing"" with great relish and the Ponchiell (I think!) is glorious..."
3,"Book Award, Schmook Award","This book is well named, because it put me in a trance reading it.How it does go on. I like to read before going to sleep and this book actually made me dread going up to bed. I'm old enough to remember when everyone was wondering what had happened to Patty Hearst, and I can't say I've learned much new, except that this story is more tragic than I had thought Thank God those days are over, and we've moved on to some other politically fraught era.For good reading, I've enjoyed most of the other reviews of this book more than the book itself."
3,"The best for swimming faster, the worst for long lasting","I own these shorts for 7 months and they are already in the trash. Stretched in the front and really stretched in the back. I have owned two pairs of these jammers and the same thing. I noticed in other reviews that other customers are experiencing the same same thing with speedo's other product. Do not buy these jammers if you are aiming for the long haul. A huge disappointment if you are looking for a long term disappointment. I have already blew $250 on this product. I am going to the advice of another customer and give TYR a shot for the long haul. Especially, for the price. $100 for 4-7 months. Ridiculous. Also, if you buy these jammers, they do run small. Buy big and only wear these for competitive play, they are not practice shorts."
4,Almost All Great,"""Travelin' Shoes"" is this CD's underappreciated gem (just try listening to it without tapping your feet vigorously), but there are also several other five-star songs, some more famous than others. Three songs are quite forgettable, however, bringing the CD's overall rating down to four stars."
3,Elvin has better tunes then this !,Elvin Bishop has a lot of good song's you will not find his best on this CD sad to say they could have got it right but someone made plenty of bad choices ! i would say half of it is good with 1)Sure feels good 2)Fooled around and fell in love 3)Travelin shoes 4)Rock my soul (live) 5)Stuttin my stuff being the best.The rest are clunker's just my 2 cent's !
1,Where's the Blues? Not here...,"Looking for authentic blues? You'll need to dig deeper than this guy is capable of delivering. For the real deal, try Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Robert Johnson, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Stevie Ray Vaughan, BB King, Lightnin' Hopkins, Albert King, Jimmy Reed, Paul Butterfield's early years, Clapton, and more... save your money and skip the Elvin Bishop. He's the Jimmy Buffet of blues or whatever."
4,Almost perfect case,The cover is much better than not having one.2 things that would make it an even better product.1. A belt clip that allows you to remove it from the belt easily (you have to remove your belt to get it out of the case)2. An opening at the bottom so you can charge the Iaudio without having to remove it from the case.Still a great deal to protect your favorite music player
5,Cool Memory pack,this thing is sooooo cul. i save lots of things on it with the 4X memory. this is good to buy
3,Good,"I may have read the description wrong, I was under the impression it was ""new"". It works, as far as I can tell. Shipped in a timely manner"
1,A waste of cash,An almost complete waste of cash as most games allow you to save without it. Do not buy this.
3,Doesn't fit properly,"Maybe user error - don't know for sure. The metal sleeve (dome) doesn't fit down over the ring properly and just spins. It's kinda like the ring is too thick. But then again, maybe my husband put it on wrong. Either way, it was cheaper on Amazon than on the Moen website."
3,More of a Reference,"I've barely used this book since buying it; if a student, check with your professor to ensure that you will be using it. The book itself is a little bulky, covering some of the history of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) or responses. It is probably a good book to have if you will not have a class on the topic. It is also a good reference to have as there are some normative data and explanations of proper elicitation of AEPs."
2,Fizzer,"Why did I buy it? Looked good, sounded good. Lived up to it's promise? Too many group shots of chatty singles in salubrious discussion. Would have been nice to have seen more shots of the food. In the end, the recipies themselves proved to be a little more of the same. Unimaginative, hardly unique."
2,3 parts- declining in quality,"The first part is riveting, about a woman misled, then abandoned. The second is mediocre- interesting but monotonuos and long, the third part is throwaway and even though it is short, it is monotonous as well. There is not enough humor: a story about a man who chases a pig for 150 pages should be hilarious but it didn't even bring a smile to this reader's lips. Don't waste your time."
4,good music,"A good registration for good music...If you like classical music, but not so classical and also not so modern, this is good for you"
3,Sometimes Glen,"The 1971 CAPITOL Creative Products LP, CHRISTMAS WITH GLEN CAMPBELL (SL-6699) features this country singer/guitarist on only half its 10 tracks. The balance is orchestra and/or chorus.SIDE ONE(There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays - Glen CampbellThe Holly and the Ivy - The Hollywood Pops OrchestraIt Must Be Getting Close to Christmas - Glen CampbellThe First Nol - The Voices of ChristmasSilent Night - Glen CampbellSIDE TWOMedley: Jingle Bells; Up on the Housetop; Jolly Old St. Nicholas - The Hollywood Pops OrchestraI'll Be Home For Christmas - Glen CampbellI Heard the Bells on Christmas Day - The Voices of ChristmasAdeste Fideles - The Hollywood Pops OrchestraThe Night Before Chistmas - Glen Campbell"
4,A classic,This is a classic toy by little girl loves. We got it when she was a baby and it still joins her on adventures (2+ years later).
4,The Values Book,"Except for the rampant nostalgia for 1910, when times were ""simpler"" and apparently nobody was concerned with teaching their children values, because back then it was naturally absorbed into every child's brain because of the stellar air quality, complete lack of social violence, and excellent parenting skills [please see the first point for parents in nearly every chapter if you have no clue to what I am referring), book was pretty decent.The layout was smooth and organized with ideas for a variety of situations. Each of the values that were covered are applicable and important, while the points and activities were thoughtful.My only wish is that the 'Thoughts for Parents' sections didn't assume that everybody reading it had no intrapersonal skills and that it stopped relying on a nostalgic fallacy. Things weren't necessarialy awesome in the past, we just talk about the craptastic parts a bit more openly and visibly."
4,Good book for teaching kids,This is an excellent tool for teaching kids about values. It has many examples and some role paying which is effective. Love it!
1,An awful book! A waste of time,I have read many books about womens rights and I agree with many of them. But A Room of One's Own is the most despicable piece of literature that I have every read. Virginia Wolf was a sexest pig who only cared about the advancement of the female race in society. There is nothing wrong with advocating womens rights but Virgia Wolf went too far. I strongly desagree with anyone buying such a pitiful excuse of a essay. Wolf wrote two and a half page paragraphs which just went on and on.
3,"Okay if you're on a budget, but otherwise...","I've used a Mad Catz card for about 2 years now, and it's been fine for the most part. However, I do know for a fact that *all* third-party memory cards go bad and stop working properly, it's just a matter of when. (Those ""compressed"" cards that store more than 15 blocks are especially flaky and unreliable.) If you can't afford to spend that much or just want a card to keep some loose non-important save files on, then a Mad Catz card will work fine. But if you've got the cash to spare, you'd be much better off buying a Sony card and getting top of the line."
1,Very Bad Quality,"Bought this memory card new thinking a memory card is a memory card, as long as it hold your data who cares about if it's a Sony or not. But when I got the card, the case was falling apart already. So I decided to remove the screws and open the plastic case and have a look inside.To my amazement, the quality of the card was so bad, one of the plastic screw posts (holding the case together) was already broken, so only one side the the case was holding the top and buttom together. The connector was not gold plated (The Sony memory cards are), this will cause the connector to wear out very quickly. When you insert this card into Playstation, it did not snap into place like the Sony card did, so this card could become loss after extended play.All these problem might cause your games not to be saved properly or erased by accident. Spend [a little extra] and get the Sony one."
1,Mad Catz = [bad] Equipment,"Mad Catz is an awful producer of products. Do NOT purchase any memory cards, controllers, or any other peripherals...they WILL become faulty."
1,POS,"I bought this memory card to be able to save all the games I just bought for the original Playstation. I have a PS2, so I needed an original playstation memory card to save them. Finally a month and a half later I'm free enough to play them and the memory card doesn't work. It says it needs to be formatted but will never format....so in essences kiddies...this product is a POS."
1,Would not recommend,"This product is strange. First off, every time i start a game I have to unplug the card to get a reaction from the actual playstation controller. I dunno if this is the products fault or the console itself but it's rather irritating. And second, I noticed that some of my games don't even save. That one I'm pretty sure I can blame the card for. Personally, I wouldn't buy this card again."
2,it was ok,the memory card served its purpose for a few days but then deleted the files i put on it only a few days after not sure i would go with this brand again
5,This is better than the playstation brand.,This works better. People who say it dont work are crazy! I started out with a official playstation brand memory card. I saved a game on it and quit. The next day i went to play the game and what happend? It wasnt there! Nothing was there! All my data was gone! I threw it away and got a mad catz memory card. Havent had a problem with it ever. Its better and come with a lable and case!
5,Memory Card PS1,"I ordered this product for my father who loves to play his PS1 games over and over. The cards came quickly and were priced right. It only took us a couple of weeks to figure out that they needed to be formatted before attempting to save a game. Once we figured that out, they have worked perfectly. If you need PS1 memory cards, these work great."
3,Lili Soundtrack,"Only was interested in title song. I was satisfied with that, the rest was of no interest; it was ok but I might better have just tried for a download of the title song in MP3. No big deal."
3,Lili audio CD,"I know it's my own fault, but for $19.95 I thought I was puchasing the movie. I was flabbergasted when I went to play the movie and learned I'd purchased an audio CD. In my defense, though, everything else listed on the page was a dvd. I felt ripped off."
1,"if you need an unbroken connection, stear clear of this","Had a wired Linksys, replaced it with this Belkin wireless router. All my PCs were still wired to the router (wireless was for a coming Xmas present). Afterwards, could not view Netflix streaming movies without losing the stream 2-5 times per movie (previously was very rare to ~ever~ have a lost stream interruption), and could not play World of Warcraft for more than 5 mins at a time before getting disconnected (previously played for hours at a time without mishap). Happened on all my PCs (XP and Vista, desktop and laptop), either direct to the router or through a switch. Put the Linksys back and everything was fine. I cannot recommend this brand of router."
1,Junk,"There's simply no getting around the fact that this router is terrible. I've been up for about three hours today, and had to restart the modem four times. Opt for another router."
2,Keeps disconnecting on downloads,"I used this router for about 2 years. It's relatively easy to setup and in general it performs OK. However, since I started having moderate downloads, it keeps disconnecting from my ADSL modem several times a week and requires restart. To me, it's a big flaw and I would not recommend this router especially for heavy internet users."
2,Just Mediocre (and not entirely honest),"This Avid release is not worth the trip. The sound is narrow and flat. Some of the so-called ""On the Air"" recordings are really studio takes (""Sun Valley Jump"" for instance.)The only reason I gave it two stars, instead of one, is because you will get a few arrangements that are not readily available (""Bless You"" is one example.)But it gives you no sense whatsoever of what the Miller band sounded like when these arrangements were new."
4,Nice bilingual baby book,"This is a nicely done baby board book covering the food items (utensils, plate, pot, cup, glass) as well as a few simple food items (milk, chicken, fish, bread, soup, ice cream and a few fruits and vegetables). The pages are easy for baby to turn, the words are provided in both English and Spanish and the pictures are engaging for baby."
1,Dont waste your time,"great price but u get what your paid, it only last 6 months and then is dead, company support do not respondits a disposable stereo"
2,Now I know y it is cheap,"I bought this dual 8182 in Jan o7 and never really played dvd's or cd's since I use my ipod for music video's and music. I decided to put a dvd in today-months after, only to find out the thing does not accept any kind of disc it just keeps ejecting repeatedly after failing to read them,so for anyone who's looking at a dual and c's my review please take warning its not worth the risk even for the cheap price."
4,Refreshing spring of hope for people of all faiths,"Mr. Coad has poured his soul into these writings; it is evident from the first reading that he has survived some trying times, but has been blessed to have gotten encouragement and strength from the reading and understanding of God's word. In such a time as we live this book is a must have and somewhat of a survival guide. Thank you for supplying the world with such inspirational writings."
4,better than the 1st edition,"I used the first edition in teaching an online journalism class -- and had to use supplementary material. I have switched to this second edition this semester and find it a much better book (not that the 1st one was bad). It has more about multimedia, rss, social media, etc"
3,Good book,"This book good to learn journalism in digital era.I'm proffesor of Journalism in Diponegoro University, Indonesia.I use this book to teach my student to understand online journalism in based."
4,TOO SAFE A SELECTION,"I like a compilation to contain some surprises, but this selection, good as it is, fails to deliver. To take 25 tracks and divide them up between Red Allen, Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Bob Crosby, Sidney Bechet, Bud Feeeman, Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, Harry James, Muggsy Spanier, and Bessie Smith seems something of a wasted opportunity. Not that they shouldn't have featured, but had they been limited to one track apiece it would have made space for, say, the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, the Dorsey brothers, the Boswell Sisters, Jean Goldkette - well, you get my drift. Granted, there's a Jack Bland (with Henry Allen again) and two Spirits of Rhythm, but the latter group is somewhat peripheral. The reasons for the various choices are advocated in the liner note, but I would like to have seen also details of recording dates and personnel."
5,A most engaging little girl,"April is such a typical little girl and it is such fun to see her grow up on Lynn Johnston's books. I raised two little girls myself and I see them over and over in reading April's adventures (and misadventures!) Her relationship with her Grandpa is a wonderful one and is movingly drawn out by Lynn Johnston. It has been a great ride seeing April and all the Patterson's grow up in so many ways. Hope it keeps on forever! Many Thanks, Lynn Johnston."
3,Folklore of Italy,"This is a somewhat unusual book because it may appeal to two age groups: Toddlers and Pre-Adolescents. The former will like the big colorful pictures and happy ending; the latter may appreciate the references to Italian culture and folklore. The plot and conclusion may be somewhat boring to children between these ages, and the very ill father may upset some toddlers. Still, very young children may enjoy the human-animal interaction and the happy denouement.A well-loved father becomes very sick; bird song seems to cheer him. Most of the birds leave as winter comes, save for one white one who continues to sing. This bird climbs up in a chimney stack to stay warm and keep the father's spirits up through his eventual recovery. Nicely illustrated, with big, ""folkish"" drawings effectively highlighting an Italian village."
5,Days of the Blackbird was a cool book,Days of the Black Bird is one of Tomie de Paola's children books. There are birds in this book. The birds make nice noise in this book. But they go away in the winter and they come back in the spring. The girl in this book tries to keep one of the birds so she will always hear nice music. She makes a nest to comfort the bird. My favorite part is when the white bird goes in the chimney. When the white comes to sing he is covered in soot and looks funny. I would recommend this book to children in the K2 and the 5th grade because it's appropriate and if your learning about Tomie de Paoloa then this would be a good book. This is just one of Tomie de Paola's books. If you want to read more of his books just go to the library.
2,IF ONLY IT HAD AN ON AND OFF SWITCH,"IT WOULD HAVE BE NICE IF IT HAD A ON AND OFF SWITCH, I THOUGHT THE ONE I ORDERED HAD ONE, WHEN I CALLED A CUSTOMER REP THEY TOLD ME THAT ONE DID, AND ONE DIDNT, I JUST HAPPENED TO GET THE ONE THAT DIDNT,IT IS VERY ANOYING TO HAVE THE LIGHT ON ALL NIGHT AND IN ORDER TO SHUT IT OFF I HAVE TO PULL THE SCANNER OUT OF THE SPOT IT IS ON MY COMPUTER DESK AND UNPLUG IT. ALSO, IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE SLOWEST SCANNERS IVE EVER SEEN. I THINK IT WAS OVER PRICED AND THAT THEY MADE IT SOUND LIKE YOU WERE GETTING A GOOD DEAL, I JUST HOPE I GET MY REBATE BACK."
1,NOT FOR WORK!!,"Yes they have a steal toe but they have a tag on them that reads""IMPORTANT WARNINGTheae shoes (boots) have been designed and manufactured as, and, for use as FASHION FOOTWEAR ONLY. They are not for use as safety footwear, and should not under any circumstances be worn as safety footwear. ..""A warning is also stitched into the inside of the boot near the heal that reads ""NON-SAFTY FOOTEAR""I am a little let down that this fact is not listed in the products description. The reason I purchased these boots for work and they do not meet the required safety standard."
1,I was betray with this purchase,"I had to pay 25 extra dollars to get my boots for import taxes!!, and I didint had this problem before with this kind of purchased. I wrote to Doc-Cross and they wrote me back a very rude answer telling me that this situation is not their problem."
1,refund,someone needs to refund my money! i have sent you and amazon emails about not receiving this item and i have had no response!!
3,Docs,"The other reviews were right--Docs are not as comfortable as they were back when I wore them in high school. The leather looks cheaper, and it's taking longer to break them in."
2,Not what Doc's used to be.,"These things while they look the same, are not. The leather is a less finished product, a cheaper leather that is not soft at all. All in all, not near what they were back when they were made in England. Made in China... sums it up."
4,"nice, But becoming",he's down it again. Useing his massive tilents to write this book upon the wolf. Cool.
4,Good collection of Rap and Rock,"I must say that this was by far a great collection of Rap and Rock songs by some great artists. The highlighs for me was NWA doing Nutin but a G Thang, Powerman 5000 Nobody is real, Mya case of the ex, Nickleback leader of men, and last Bionic Jive Pump. The bad part of this cd was in my viewpoint track 8 Ja Rule Between you and me, track 10 Eve love is blind, and track 15 the song called and you know us by the trail of the dead just couldn't do anything for me. Plus I listen to a ton of music and with an open mind still didn't enjoy those songs. Rest of the album is mind blowing so if your a fan of rap and rock songs then pick this cd up and enjoy the mixture it offers for all types of fans."
5,I love the Iguana,"The Iguana pendant is for any iguana lovers out there. The little iguana has a personality that shines forth. If you want something unusual, this is the pendant for you."
3,It's a book that clarifies fundamentals of EDI / XML / E-com,"In a world of mushrooming computer Buzz words, Sullivan's attempt to give lucid fundamental picture and use of EDI, XML in E-commerce is quite useful for a beginner who wants to make a career in this field."
3,Good for non-technical management people,"It gives you a good review of what EDI is. However, you really don't get to know much technical about EDI. It would be great if there are more examples as well."
5,"Fun, time goes by fast...","when you throw in this dvd. I love her workouts. I love her as an instructor. At first, I do have to say some of it gets pretty difficult to follow, as it's kind of fast paced. But once you've done it a few times, you get the hang of it."
5,Excellent workout DVD to get you into shape,"This is a great DVD to get you into shape. When I first started working out, I used the cardio segment of this DVD with warm-up and cool-down. As I become stronger I will do both segments back to back. It gets your heart rate up and you will work up a sweat. It's a solid workout for both beginner and intermediate level. I especially like her cool-down. It's one of the better and thorough stretch segments I have seen."
3,better but not her best,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.This was a better workout than the Cardio Sculpt DVD but, still, there were too many points where I was not working at all either due to recovery periods or explanations.Also, for some reason, the moves just did not seem to flow well for me --- the low point being the kick-jack segment. I usually don't have trouble picking up routines on the first round but I was seriously concentrating and playing catch up to follow the moves on that one.I have always liked this instructor since I started working out with DVDs. That said, her commentary went over that fine line from encouraging to overkill. I would have preferred more silence to catch phrases that were repeated one time too often. For myself, a plain old rep count is always preferable to anything else."
2,Tried several times.,"I have tried this workout several times through streaming here and netflix. I just could not get into it. I love cardio/weight mixes but this was just hard to understand her cues and didn't pose a huge challenge for me. I heard she was part of Powerstrikes or some kickboxing brand so I was very interested, but I just didn't find it here. Seems like a knowledgeable instructor that practices what she preaches (you don't get that body by not working for it), but it didn't translate well onto this video."
4,A workout I will actually do regularly,"I have been doing Jillian's 30 day shred and I also love a few of the Turbo Jam workouts. But I just won't do them every day-- they take a major commitment for me after a long day of work. This workout makes me sweat, but it's relatively easy if you've done any weights and cardio before. I don't really believe I'll ""get results"" like the others, but at this point, I want to enjoy doing a daily workout, and this is enjoyable and doable. So I'll mix it up with a few of the more difficult DVDs, but I'm really glad is have this one! Violet is great, too! love that aussie accent!"
4,Good but could be more effective,"I have taken various kickboxing classes so I am accustomed to the various combinations that this workout applies. However, if you are a beginner or not totally coordinated you may end up finding yourself spending more time trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing rather than sweating.To me a lot of the strength training was a waste - not enough repetitions to really get any burning feeling.The cardio is decent a few times I felt a bit winded and I would definitely say that this is a fun work out - fast paced and the instructor is upbeat and pleasing to listen to.I was sweating by the end of it but wasn't as thrilled with the workout as I was hoping."
5,Wow what a great workout!,"I was actually searching for a Jillian Michaels kickboxing dvd when I came across this one. All the reviews were so positive I decided to give it a try. I had never heard of Violet Zaki, so I was a little hesitant, but her credentials looked outstanding. This is such a great workout. I like how I can choose to either do 1 20min workout or both depending on my day. Either way it certainly gets your heart pumping, and makes me feel stronger each time I do it! Violet has such a great disposition about her - a great trainer and motivator. This dvd certainly won't collect any dust in my home!"
5,Great 20 minutes!,"I love this workout video! I have several different videos and this is by far the most enjoyable for me. The workouts are only 20 minutes which is great for me; I'm a full-time mom so I don't have time for long workouts. I love the incorporated kick-boxing moves, it really changes up your workout and makes it fun. This is the first video that I've exercised with and haven't looked at the clock every few minutes to see when I would finally be done, it's great!"
2,"Set too dark, need lots of room!","First off, this will take more room than the average person has. Secondly, the set was dark, and the camera angles were horrible. This made it difficult to see what you were supposed to do (proper form and movement). I have went to kickboxing classes in the past, and this DVD just does not do kickboxing as a cardio workout justice. I had to go running afterward just to get my workout, and I will not be adding it as part of my workouts anymore. If I can't get a good workout the first time I use a workout DVD, it's not worth my time. There are too many DVD's out there that will give me a good workout the first time. Maybe it is better for people who are just beginning to workout for the first time in their life."
4,Energized to exercise,"Today was my first time trying this workout. Although most DVD's these days try to scam you by not really caring about your weight loss, but money for the matter. But Violet sure does not do that! She is ready to help you achieve your goal, by getting you motivated to have a great workout! It's fun to be able to kick mid air, and get some of a hard days aggression out. One of my favorite parts was the cool down at the end. It completely relaxed you and your muscles, so I know I won't be as sore tomorrow. And the other great thing about this video is that once I have gotten used to doing one of the 20 minute workouts, I can eventually do both. Weight Loss Cardio Kick is completely recommended! During the workout she knows when the tough parts come along and really pushes you to go the extent you need to go. I will post some of my body results after I try this for about a month. For I'm not overweight but am trying to lose the last 10 pounds."
3,Pretty good...,"This video is ok. The cardio ""blasts"" are really the only parts where I feel like I'm getting a good workout. The rest of it is just kind of ""ehhh."" After having done some Jillian Michael's workout dvd's, this is like a walk in the park. I do this on a day when I need to ""rest"" a little bit and not do a hard core work out."
2,Needs more direction,The dvd isn't that bad but I find that it's defintiely not for beginners. She goes way too fast and doesn't show proper technique on form or stance or anything like that. I guess if you already know about cardio kick it's good. But I just started out with this and I am not that pleased.
3,Are these really the original artists ?,I do like the music but as I listen to each song they sound nothing like the original singers. Now according to the box they are the original but I have my doubts.The price was super for all three c.d.s' To me they sound like they are trying to sound like the real ones. BUYER BEWARE
5,TAFFY,I LOVE BANANA TAFFY! and it's hard to find. I recieved my taffy petty fast and it did my craving! No I'm not pregnant. Just LOVE!!! I would work with this buyer again! Excellent to do business with!
2,a little dry,"Cheese was a little dry to eat with fruit or bread, however the flavor was good. Would have been better to be able to purchase small,uncut, tied ball of cheese. Also, can buy smaller pieces of this same brand of cheese in local supermarkets."
2,"Don't buy it, wait for it to arrive at your local library.","If you are a fan of the show, then this book will stike you as both fun and offensive. It did for me, anyway. There are numerous facts and figures that I found interesting, but much of the text was filled with bad jokes and witless humor, as if the author was trying to be as funny as the show. It also has a whole section devoted to ripping the show to shreds. It points out how the show does reflect the way a real lawyer's life is, i.e. cases do not settle in an hour. There is a brief episode guide filled with the author's own opinion of each episode. There are some little know facts that are interesting and some down-right stupid comments that I thought assinine. Don't bother wasting $11 on this book. Check it out from the library, take it home, read the good parts, and return it. That's my opinion."
3,It's an interesting view on Ally McBeal,"This book is quite good. It shows both sides of the story. So in some parts in may offend big Ally McBeal fans, like myself. But then you read on and find out that she later says that she doesn't really agree with that side and says why. Kathy Mitchell has some interesting ideas about.....what goes on inside Ally's head. I give her one star because she loves the show enough to write a book about it, a 2nd star for showing both sides and a 3rd star for the humour. I'd give it a 4th star if there wasn't so many references to her weight. I think it's a really good book! I'm a tough judge, you know!"
1,I shoulda had a V-8,"There's not enough about the show; cheesy Polaroids from yesteryear when Calista was still in the womb; and silly layouts screaming for coverage in Teen Beat. I'll say pass on it and wait for the ""official"" one for real fans."
3,"It's OK, but I am a die hard Ally Fan, so I have mixed views","It's ok, but a bit cheesy. I am waiting for the official one! DEK rocks! John and Fish were explored nicely though."
5,Great Find,"Could anyone make a bad record with this rhythm section? I was somewhat familiar with the name Sonny Clark and am sure there must be at least one recording in my collection in which he is a sideman, but I wasn't prepared to be as impressed as I was when I stumbled on this gem. I'll be looking out for other albums for sure."
2,Bad handles,"I have bought heavy hands products for a number of years as I use them as my exercise of choice. I had recently ordered a second pair of weights and handles to leave at another house I have. I got them out to use and I was surprised that I can barely squeeze my hand into the handle, and I have small hands. It was cold a couple of mornings and I needed to wear gloves but to no avail, Someone has really messed up on the current method of sizing the handles for these."
1,Buy something else,This pen lasted less than a month before the mechanism broke. Very nice to write with while it lasted. Still looks good. Buy something else if you plan to write with it. Great if you just want to look at it.
1,Pen broke the second time I used it.,"Otherwise, it was a very beautiful pen to look at and to hold. I can still make the pen work by removing the top part and pushing the pen stick down. So glad this wasn't a gift, except to myself!"
2,As reliable as a puppy that isn't potty trained.,"I bought this player and at first I was very pleased with my purchase. The sound was good, it was light, and the screen was nice and big, but...after a few more uses I found that the screen pixelated every time the scene it was playing was in the shade or dark. Also, I would put in a DVD (that I had played before and had been crystal clear) and it either wouldn't play at all or it was so pixelated I couldn't watch it. The player freezes whenever you least expect it and the remote is horribly designed. If you press the pause button twice it goes into step and then you have to search for the play button. All around, I returned it and I wish I had stayed with my old Coby, even if it was falling apart."
1,"can not play most DVD ""invalid Disk""","This product was very picky on DVD since the first day I bought it. I did not return it since it could play a DVD that my baby daughter especially like. But after six months and just a few times use, now it just refuses to play ANY DVD, and says ""invalid disk"". Believe me, It would be a mistake to buy it!"
3,Decent Player but NO Divx,"I too was fooled by online retailers touting this as a divx certified player, it IS NOT, it's a decent player but does not support Divx."
4,Good Value - All Natural,"The (strawberry) taste wasn't the most overwhelmingly pleasant of all of the various strawberry flavors I've tried in the past, but the sweetening component IS the (all-natural) stevia product as opposed to the acesulphame-potassium and/or sucralose combos which are more prevalent in many of the competing products. The powder mixes up very ""thick"" which is good to some, maybe not so much for others. This whey protein concentrate also contains a ""little extra"" BCAAs in the mix.The Now foods brand products are a great ""no frills"", guaranteed content product line."
1,Yuck,"Besides having a great deal of problems with the seller, this protein smelled rancid when I opened it and had no vanilla taste.I did not want to test it any further for fear of food poisoning, but the quality control just isn't up to snuff. Maybe this is a 1 in a 100 event, but I'm sure I don't like those odds when it comes to my food and health."
2,Meant to get isolate. Dont get this.,"Like Jeremy, I screwed up and bought this, the NON isolate. This stuff all around sucks. Mixes badly and tastes bad. They should have moderated the taste a bit. Come on, no one expects protein powder to taste that good, it just has to be bearable. It isn't going to taste like a chocolate milkshake no matter how hard you try. I accidentally bought 10 lb of this. Spend the extra 20-30 bucks and get the ISOLATE from NOW. I last bought a 10 lb bag of the isolate which mixes a lot better and tastes a lot better. Be wary, they packaging difference is subtle. 2 stars for mixing bad and tasting bad. I have had worse though.NON-isolate SUCKS. Dont get it.Isolate is good. Get it."
2,Get the isolate instead,"I normally by the NOW whey protein isolate which is great. But this time I screwed up and ordered the Whey concentrate. Big mistake, I've had gas and bloating for almost two days, and I eat multiple serving of yogurt and milk everyday with no problems. Short story get the Whey Isolate, it is excellent, mixes well, tastes great and digests well."
2,Product not same as picture,"So I was ordering based on the picture...probably not the best idea on my part. The picture reads ""whey protein ISOLATE"" when I received the product...no isolate, just regular whey protein. After mixing it with milk, and trying it, it doesnt seem to taste that bad. I wanted to try something new rather than the EAS protein I have been using for the past 6 years, but I think I will not continue to use this unless it for some reason does wonders to my body."
2,Too sweet,I wanted to like this but the stevia is an overpowering factor that hinders the chocolate flavor. I have to dilute it with an unflavored protein powder to make it tolerable.
4,pretty ok performance,I Like the item...pretty decent performance..... vibrations are quite high at higher volume levels....not that satisfactory at high volumes....but otherwise a decent bang for bucks
3,Sound controlling speaker sound dominating,"Hi friends i have this speaker and used it for a week and return them back because the sound from one speaker is dominating all the speaker's sound we can't able to recognize the other speakers. Other than this all the other are very good like the design of the speakers sound quality, bass effect"
1,surround sound speakers,Piece of absolute junk...had a short in it from the get go and was not compatible with my system at all
4,Couldn't put it down,Very exciting & hard to put down! Too much intimate descriptions for my taste but great story. Can't wait to read book 2...I like to follow characters
3,weak characters,"This was a nice story but I didn't really connect with the characters. When they went back in time, Alex seemed to pick up the life there very easily and had no problem fitting in even though he admitted to not really knowing about that time period. ."
5,A great first book!,"I read Terri Brisbins book and loved it. If you love Time Travels, this is a must read."
2,An unfinished product,"The premise of this book had lots of promise. There's a wealth of materials and characters to work with in this book; however, there's little character development at all. The main character is the most fleshed out, but by that I don't mean he's completely real to the reader. It just means that the other characters were just not that well thought out.There's so much more that could have been done with this book. I agree with the reviewer that said a better editor would have gone a long way. Not only would he or she corrected the many grammatical errors and factual flaw but they also would have pushed for a much more developed plot and characterization of the characters. It reads like a second draft that was accidently submitted."
1,A train wreck,This book was like a bad train wreck. I couldn't believe how horrible it was. I ended up skimming most of the book just to see how many bodies were left in the wreckage. The proof reading was atrocious. The story was amatuerish at best. Don't waste your time.
1,"Too narrow, too blah",... My gay friend handed it over to me without letting me know his thoughts (he did not want to sway me one way or another).The book seemed pretty amatuerish to me and the plot and characters I found dull. I was supposed to care about what happens but never really did. Turns out my friend felt the same way.
2,Strictly Amateur,"Not good. Believe me. I swear I will never buy one these self-published ""novels"" again."
2,Downer,"No happy ending for this first novel by Stephen M. Hart. In fact, nothing much happy happens anywhere in this story about a gay man of 32 who thinks he has never met another gay person in his entire life (and this story is set in Massachusetts!). The only likeable character is the dog, Jake. The others are shallow and/or mean and/or self-centered.But what is really irritating is that the publisher, iUniverse, evidently does not employ any proofreaders. There are -- literally -- hundreds of typos, spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in this 220 page book. Some are comical: ""Do you have any bothers or sisters?"" The same boo-boos can be found in other books from this house.Mr.Hart is said to be working on his next novel. Good luck."
3,Not a bad first book,The book was enjoyable though the quality of the writing wasn't 5 stars. No point in raving about a book for the sake of raving. Still I would be curious to read another book by the same author. Yeah I would read it.
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased this bracelet for my daughter. I attempted to put it on her arm and it broke. One of the links just pulled apart and out of shape. It doesn't even have any discernable markings saying that it is silver. Silver usually holds up a bit better than one use.
3,it's ok,"If you're not looking for anything fancy, but just want a charm bracelet, this'll do the job. Probably a better purchase for a child if you aren't looking for anything special. You get what you pay for with this one, the price is cheap, therefore the bracelet is too."
3,They look very good!,"We dont really use coasters much and I keep mine in my den for when friends comes by. They are more for looks than function. They look nice and they are 4.5"" across. Only kick I have is they are much lighter color, At a glance they look like pine.And they look good on amazon but the ones I got dont have rounded edges. Look like they were made fast. Only details are 3 shallow rings cut into the tops. But I do like the bamboo."
2,Drinks stick to them,"These are nice looking, but drinks will stick to them if there is any moisture on them. We are getting rid of ours and going to get something else. Not much fun having them stick and then fall off clattering on the wood table and floor."
3,Cheap craftsmanship,"These are elegant coasters for the money, but there are some flaws. For one, the holder was practically falling apart by the time it arrived; fortunately, I don't need it. Also, the quality of the individual coasters vary; some have a smooth finish, while others have small splinters of wood sticking out. Still, these are a step above flat, plastic coasters, adding a touch of elegance to one's dinner table."
2,bamboo coasters,"workmanship is not great.when you see them,they have a chintsy look.not as good looking as they appear in the picture."
5,Great Item,"Great item. The product serves its purpose and was a great buy. I would recommend this item. Also, the product is high in quality."
3,"Decent, but nothing fancy","I mainly bought these because my husband and I have nice, new nightstands that we didn't want damaged from a glass of water sitter there over night. These work well... they're not exceptionally nice looking, they do stain easy, but they've kept my nightstands in good shape so I can't complain! I wouldn't keep them in my living room where anybody could see them though."
1,Surface is cracking,These wood coasters don't have much of a finish. I've only had them a month and one coaster is warping the way that unfinished wood will do when exposed to moisture. I recently noticed that one is starting to crack. When I lifted it up to see if the crack was through to the bottom there was a small pool of water from where my glass had dripped onto the coaster and the water had leaked through the crack onto my desk. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a coaster?
1,Doesn't absorb any water,"Theses coasters look nice, but are not functional. They do not absorb any water, so you end up having to wipe the tables right away."
1,Cheap and Not effective,These leaked all over my table. Did not soak up the glass sweat and cracked from water log. They also stick to your glasses so when you pick them up they fall down on the table with a loud crash.
3,Lipper Bamboo 7-Piece Coaster Set,"These coasters are very nice looking but they actually absorb some of the sweat from your glass, leaving them a slightly lighter color. These coasters aren't lined with any felt on the bottom, either."
1,Crappy right out of the box,Two of the three upright pieces were loose right out of the box. I'll wait till they fall off and then glue them on correctly.
2,Pretty Cheaply Made,"The holder was cheaply made and broke. The coasters aren't absorbent at all, they just collect liquid in their rings/groves. Overall I am pretty disappointed with this set. How hard is it to get coasters right?"
5,you are my miracle,an outstanding children's book - nice price break on it - arrived on time and in perfect shape
5,Sweet book,"Wonderful book at the chirstmas season, to help parents take a moment and read with their children. It is such a sweet book."
2,For sentimental adults,"This is a very sweet book, but it is written for adults to get sentimental about their children. My daughter could have cared less. The idea is nice, but it doesn't flow and is sort of forced."
2,What Film,"In my opinion the only part of this film worth seeing is the ""authentic"" display of Native American tribe life."
5,"The Moody Blues: Live at the Isle of Wight, 1970","I love this DVD disc, I play it a lot. It's fantastic to see The Moody Blues play live music at this musical fest when they were a young band but they will always be fantastic. I love all of the music they play from the beginning to the present time."
4,another Nanci gem,"A wonderfull remastering job done to her first three cd's,these now have a much more detailed and warm sound,the instruments which were previosly buried now all have a very nice clarity.The matriel on all three of these early discs is fairly similiar featuring Nanci's very vivid songwriting with a folk/country backing.Nanci's best versions of her songs have always been live ones,check out her cd One Fair Summers Eve for the definitive versions of many of these songs after you have explored the originals"
1,This is NOT truly a karaoke CD!,"This CD is completely useless! It should not be advertised as a karaoke CD as there are no graphics and no words on the screen. That is, it is not CD-G format. My mistake was not reading the reviews first."
2,unpleasant surprise,"This CD is not in CD&G format. There are no graphics on the monitor that shows the words of the song as it's being played. The orchestral music is good but since the words on screen are lacking, the CD is a disappointment."
3,"no words, no fun!",i was disappointed that the words didn't show up on the karaoke machine for the elvis songs. i ordered 2 discs with elvis songs & they were both this way. :( they did send liner notes with the words but that's not as fun for the kids.
3,good review,I recieved the product quicker than implied. I had not problems with the product or the company.
1,very disappointing,There seems to be only pics in magazine.. no real articles and even the pics are not of interest to me.. . did not find it useful
1,Elle decor,"frankly, less than 1 star. i have not recvd the current issue on the newstands, already some wks old. the renewal rate was not great. same w/my other continuous subscription, house beautiful: rate not great. please do better."
1,Still Waiting,I ordered this magazine in November and here it is January 2nd and I have still not received the magazine.
1,Still have not received this magazine,I would like to give this a good review however they have still not sent this magazine to me. I think this is a total rip off.
2,Not Met Home and will not re-subscribe,"I COMPLETELY echo everything that Linda A. wrote above, and couldn't have said it any better, and would only had that most all the homes featured are of the uber-rich, making it uninteresting and inaccessible.""I was a Metropolitan Home subscriber, and as an artist, I enjoyed the color, variety, and design influences in the magazine. When the publisher ceased Met Home, they gave me the remainder of my subscription in Elle Decor. Beige, ecru, eggshell, dull and traditional. No thanks. I think they killed the wrong magazine."" ~ Linda A. (above comment)"
2,frustrated,wish the digital version came with the paper subscription.seems unreasonable to have to carry paper when the digital subscription doesnt work well!
2,Mostly advertising,Good photography but the entire magazine is mostly filled with advertising and little to no articles of interest. Large format but little content.
3,Elle Decor,"Magazine Title: ""Elle Decor""-Good layout and good writing but my interest tends to the more modern. Example, ""Architect Digest""."
1,Still have not recevied,Still have not gotten issue one - and no response to m y emails. but they have already started sendig me spam
5,Luscious Eye Candy!,"A stunning magazine full of lush, modern rooms. Yes, there is little here that the average person can afford, but I don't want a design magazine that looks like a Pottery Barn catalog.I look at a design magazine for inspiration, and I read Elle Decor from cover to cover, including the ads.Many of the rooms are bursting with color. I find all kinds of ideas for accessorizing my house even though my budget is limited.If you have ever wondered how to put together all the items you've bought over the years in a way that pleases the eye, read Elle Decor!"
2,Dull traditional decor,"I was a Metropolitan Home subscriber, and as an artist, I enjoyed the color, variety, and design influences in the magazine. When the publisher ceased Met Home, they gave me the remainder of my subscription in Elle Decor. Beige, ecru, eggshell, dull and traditional. No thanks. I think they killed the wrong magazine."
1,"Mostly pictures, not Midwest friendly","Had high hopes but this magazine was mostly pictures of over decorated designer homes. Very few prices listed or where you can buy it, just 1-800 numbers to call and order. The few prices they list are like 6 grand for an end table. The only articles were about designers lives not about decorating. Just wasn't for me."
5,Decor for All done right -,"Elle Decor - simply the best. Wonderful, eclectic decor - sophisticated, original, beautiful, always. Inspirational, thoughtful. The best American decorating magazine."
3,Wont renew...,"I wont be renewing. Lots of ads and extreme prices. Pretty pics and few good ideas, but will try House Beautiful next time."
2,Rife with ads,"If you are looking for home designer tips and usable ""do it yourself"" information - don't invest your money in this publication. Advertising consumes most of the pages and the products promoted are at a price point unattainable by most. My typical way of measuring value of a publication is the number of pages I earmark. I haven't earmarked any in the three issues I received to date."
2,"weak, repetitive","I am a big fan of Thomas Newman. This is just too much the same on every track, unless you like the Balkan dirge(s) for variety."
1,Don't waste your time & money,"This headset was very poorly made. It didn't fit right at all,plus it didn't even work. It needs to be pulled off the market."
1,Poor Quality.,"Poor quality, the headset is VERY uncombfortable and in looks like it's going to tear into pieces just by looking at it."
3,NOT compatible with all Midland Family Radios,"Amazon's product description says, ""Use the Midland 22-540 headset speaker with boom microphone with all Midland family radio models."" It does not work with the Midland 1001Z CB radio, and the VOX (voice-activated transmit) does not work with the Midland handheld 75-785 CB radio. It is still good value for money, but be aware that it might not be compatible with other gear you are buying."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"this head set works like it says it does, but it is cheply made and no good for motorcycle use."
1,very pooooor item,"I ordered 2 of this item, All I can say : it should not be for sale ! it is a peice of junk and made of very cheep materials. On item was not working at all, the other came with a factory defect in the mic. I threw both of them in the recycle pin.Don't even think of ordering it."
3,Read Product Description and You will Know,"Yes these are cheaply made as evidenced by the price. They are basically a toy, but the people who complain that they don't work on CB radios and the like, simply didn't read the Description which states ""with boom microphone will make conversing on your Midland family radio easier and more convenient."" These are ONLY for FRS Radios from Midland, but may work on other FRS radios as long as they have the same plug arrangement. BTW, FRS stands for Family Radio Service as in Motorola TalkAbouts and the like, NOT CBs. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Good headsets like this cost anywhere from about $75 up."
3,Headset,The headset worked fine but it is not designed to be used in the way I wanted to be used -riding a motorcycle....
1,Junk,"This is not what I expect from Midland. The unit is very cheaply made, has no comfort, adjustment is terrible the unit will not stay on your head. I expected a higher quality piece of equipment. These will be worn by a Production crew and the requirement to stay on your head while leaving your hands free to move sets is the primary purpose. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Good unit,"I bought this instead of the RO because of limited space. Easy to install if you have basic plumbing knowledge. Faucet is solid. GPM is low initially, but once the filter has cleared, it picks up to a respectable pace. Water tastes good. Don't buy the cheaper Culligan, its worth the extra few bucks to get the nice faucet this unit has."
3,Be mechanically inclined,"The instructions are nearly worthless unless you know basic plumbing. BEWARE of the line connection into the faucet. Once you push it in it is there to stay. No teflon tape is included. Also, the instructions doesn't mention it but be sure to mount the housing as high under the sink as you can because you will have to remove the filter housing nearly the same length as the filter, mount it twice the hieght of the unit itself. I really expected more water flow. I had serious flow rate problems at first to which I can't figure what was the problem; after undoing and reattaching all the lines and such the flow finally was around 1 +/- GPM. The advertisement did not indicate GPM flow rate so I guess this was to be expected. As for quality of the ouput water? Jury is still out as I just finished the install."
1,What's Amazon Up To?,I was just at the Watts Premier web site looking for product specs and discovered that this is the same unit as the Watts 500313 2 Stage filter system that Amazon is selling for $59.99! Why the big price difference? Amazon....something looks fishy!
1,Complete waste of time,"If you want to learn to develop software using UML with VB then don't get this book. It won't help at all. It doesn't explain how to use UML, and it doesn't explain how to develop VB code based on UML diagrams.The book has a lot on project management, but I found this also completely useless. There is a huge case study of a concert booking and ticket sales system, which is a good idea, but any meaningful information is lost in a sea of extra-verbose descriptions of what all the different 'architects' are doing and how they are being motivated to do a good job. It's like trying to learn UML and how it gets transformed into VB code by reading the verbal description of a very detailed workflow chart in Microsoft Project.If you're interested in a good beginning book on UML with a useful case study, try ""Sams Teach Yourself UML in 24 Hours"" by Joseph Schmuller (2nd edition).Don't waste your money on this book."
1,STAY AWAY FOM PCDJ PROGRAMS!!!!,"NEVER right reviews, but if you are reading this please be advised to stay away from Visionsonic PCDJ. this program is TERRIBLE and totally unreliable! Everything was going well in the honeymoon stage of the program, but a few months into using this live at gigs, I've had several drop-outs in audio and software crashes and freezes. TRUST ME, i've heard nothing bad reviews about this program after the fact and now I know why. I did everything I needed to ensure this program ran efficiently (music on separate hardrive, no other running programs during use, ect) and yet PCDJ crashes IN THE MIDDLE OF LIVE GIGS. As a DJ both mobile and the radio, there's no worse feeling then dead-air. STAY AWAY FROM PCDJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Irish traveller photos,"These are good pictures, mostly from the early 1970's, with some more recent pictures. There is little commentary and the pictures do not amount to a photoessay, however. I suspect the author just happened to have some random, but high quality, traveller photos in his career collection which he (correctly) assumed would be publishable. The only reasons to get this book are that 1) he is an excellent photographer, and 2) so few journalists have paid any attention to this fascinating subculture."
5,still the definitive Lennon collection as i as i'm concerned...,"doesn't get any better than this three cd compilation of John's music from 1970-1980. i think the track exclusions only amount to about three tracks and truthfully i don't miss em! and of course, you just get john's tracks from all albums released as john and yoko (i have to admit while i'm not a huge Yoko fan, some of her tracks aren't all that bad~Check out a song by her called Open Your Box~far-out stuff!)"
2,Blind to reality,"While it is certainly true that parents have all kinds of effects on their children's mental development, this book denies the fact that there is overwhelming evidence for the genetic/biological component of schizophrenia. Just as astronomers once cringed at people believing that the sun revolves around the earth, so scientists these days would cringe at the premise of this book. As such it threads into quackery territory.This book will be popular with the tinfoil hat crowd, but falls into the abyss of pseudoscientific trash."
1,Amazing,Set one side for EST and set the other for Euro time. The Euro side must be on holiday because it didn't work.
1,false advertising,"they still show this item as available and in fact it's never been available. the manufacturer has discontinued it, yet amazon still shows it as ready to sell!"
3,Not nearly as good as his other stuff,"Doesn't have the same hard sf feel that his continuing time novels do. Not bad, just different."
5,Jerry beany baby in black tshirt why not,I love the Grateful Dead when I saw this I just had to have it. I've been burning my cd collection on to my pc and my Jerry bear is right next to my pc at my work station. A great add on to my collection of Grateful Dead stuff.
2,Scrath and Sniff is a disappointment!,"I eagerly anticipated the arrival of the scratch and sniff stickers ordered from Education Station. From the picture, they looked like the throw-back stickers from the 1980s and 1990s. However, the stickers I received did not look like the ones in the image. They were very small and the images were completely different."
1,Will not buy these stickers or anything from this company,I'm happy I read the reviews first before paying for the items in my cart. I collect the old scratch n sniffs from the 70's and 80's and I would have been very angry had I received something I did not want. What kind of people are these who mislead others? I really hope that what they're doing comes back and bites them in the A**!!!!And why are we required to give stars to those who are undeserving? Where's a middle-finger button when you need one?
1,:(,I was so excited to find these stickers but i am happy i read other people's reviews first. i will not be buying these stickers since many people have been disapointed with the product
3,My dog hates It,"This is a hard file...much too hard for my little dog's nails. She hates it, and therefore I'm not fond of it either."
1,Very uninteresting book,hard to read and just boring ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
4,product vs customer service,"The product is a good value for the money, that being said, Belkins customer service is by far the worst I have ever encountered in my life.They should be ashamed to even call it customer service."
1,Plowing through War and Peace was easier,This is a very pompous book about someone's reading habits. I found it very stuffy to read and was glad I didn't have to pay for it. I'm erasing it from my hard drive.
5,Great Video,Great children's films. Well made. True to Potter's original stories and faithful rendition of her art style. Really charming.
5,The Beatrix Potter Collection,"My grandchildren, ages 6 and 4, loved watching these over their Christmas visit. What a lovely change from all of the violence and crude humor in so many things for children these days!"
5,Awesome movie!,"My daughter loves these movies. I, myself, adore these stories as well. I have searched everywhere for a collection of all the movies together and was thrilled to find them here. I can pass down to my daughter the love of Beatrix Potter. These are well done and very entertaining."
4,Potter collection is great,"I am very happy with the Beatrix Potter collection. I had four or five video cassettes and knowing these are almost obsolete, I was thrilled to get nine stories on two DVDs and they were made by the same company that made the video cassettes.The only thing that is kind of annoying, is you can't just watch the whole thing. You have to go back to the menu and pick one after each story is done. But otherwise I am so pleased with the collection.I recommend this to anyone who is a Potter fan, like I am."
5,Beatrix Potter,"Little ones love these captivating, bed time stories. They are gently told with pretty animation and color, restful music, delightful voices, (unlike the untrained, nasal-squeeling-whiny voices we hear lately). Very enjoyable, kind hearted entertainment for young & old. A true value."
5,Stays true to Potter's illustrations and voice,"Beautifully done. Loved by all ages in our family. This is a breath of fresh air amidst the mindless Disney drivel that pervades children's movie selections. We purchased this collection for our two-year-old's birthday, and as we predicted, the rest of the family enjoy it, as well. We have a ""no commercial TV"" policy in our house, so these make great rainy day movies.The animation stays true to Potter's illustrations and the stories are told in accordance to the words in the books (no paraphrasing). The animated characters fill in the story where the narrator leaves off. We enjoyed the blending of real life actors in the introduction and the animation. It made for a more engaging experience."
5,Wonderful production!,"Beatrix Potter's tales are timeless classics, and this BBC video production of them doesn't change them at all. Based on her illustrations, these tales come to life on the screen. Each episode begins with live action of 'Beatrix Potter' and her animal friends, penning the story that is about to be told, and leads into an animated story based on her books.The music and sound quality are lovely. As it's an older production, it's not crisp on a large HD tv screen, but still beautiful to watch. Children and adults will love watching Peter Rabbit, Samuel Whiskers, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-Duck, Mr. Tod, Tom Kitten, Jeremy Fisher and many more characters come alive!"
5,beatrix potter collection,"This collection of B.P. chikdren's tales is beautifully done---engaging for children and will back happy memories for adults. It is soft, gentle, and artistic, with good life lessons to be learned."
5,"Buy this one, NOT the cheap lackluster two dvds Goodtimes release!","Do not buy the Goodtimes release!!! It's way inferior to this 2008 BBC release! I compared them head to head and the difference is so obvious! The Goodtimes release managed to ruin the picture quality, it sure has to do with the fact that they squeeze the whole thing into two single layer dvds, as opposed to the BBC release who got them on three dvds.Sure, the price on Goodtimes it's much lower, or you can pump-up the colors on your player/display but the missing data cannot be replaced ! I wish someone told me that when I did my buying!"
5,Just Enchanting!,I had the old vcr tapes and was so delighted to purchase the collection on DVD.This will make wonderful gifts for my family members and children of friends.The best illustrations you could ever witness. Truly a classic for many generations to come.
4,"Good 2.5 -6 year old shows, Wholesome life lessons","This set was a good value and my 2.5 year old and 6 year old both enjoy all the different stories. The only thing I do not like about these DVD's is that there is no ""Play All"" available in the menu and you have to go back to the beginning of each show to press play again. Other than that, it was a great investment for my children and myself."
5,One of my treasures!,This Beatrix potter DVD's are just like my treasures ... best cartoons for the kids and grown ups .. I love to watch these .. the picture quality is great and the episodes are just simply amazing .. Its a must in anyone's collection of stories !
5,beatrice potter collection DVD,"Item arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I watched this series with my boys back in the mid 1990's on television when it came out as a weekly special. The music, the photography, the scenery is just stunning in the beginning of the show and the end of the show. It just takes you to the rolling hills of England over 100 years ago. Just stunning visuals and the cartoons are just beautifully done and just precious to watch. My boys are older now but reluctantly they sat and watched a few episodes with me and it took them back to when they were little and they loved it. The best product for a DVD your money will buy. A treasure to add to your DVD collection."
3,Plantronics T20 Update,"Since this product is still being sold and preceding reviews were some time ago, I'll share my recent experience with the product. It's stylish and solid. The volume and tone controls are accessible and effective. Received audio (ear speaker) is clear and rich. Transmit audio (microphone)is adequate, but could use a gain control.Disappointments: Line and mute controls are very close together, occasionally leading me to disconnect a line when I reach to mute it. No memory functions other than 'Redial', which doesn't seem to work on the second line.GLARING INADEQUACY: The BLARING touch tones generated by dialing and navigating through interactive phone systems are way too loud, even at the lowest volume settings. Bad idea, bad design, bad Plantronics. Bad, bad, bad."
3,Fragile headsets,"This phone works well for what I need -- but I've gone through two headsets in two years! The first one just quit working -- the second was destroyed when my son stepped on the cord and it broke off at the jack. So be sure to have a warranty or a replacement plan ... and of course, it's the headset, not the base, that's the expensive part."
3,No Microphone Volume?,"This is a solid well built unit that I have no problems using or hearing. The only problem I have is that there is no volume control for the microphone, which seems to be an exception for most Plantronics headsets I've seen. I have to really speak up to get callers to hear me even after adjusting the microphone boom to the position that gives the highest volume."
1,No way to get people to hear me - had to send it back,"As I read the reviews here before purchasing, I saw that many people said callers could not hear them. One reviewer said, ""No problem. Just get a different headset."" So I ordered.Well, that was an old review and the phone must have changed since then. Once I received the phone, I found that callers could not hear me well, as expected. But, the plug that connects the headset to the phone is not the typical plug you see on most headsets (2.5 mm jack). Instead, this was an ""RJ9"" plug (like a mini telephone jack plug). NOBODY makes a headset with this type of plug and Plantronics only makes one headset with an RJ9 plug - this one that doesn't work.I also searched in vain for an adaptor that could enable me to connect a regular headset to this phone.I loved everything else about this phone, but if people on the other end of the line couldn't hear me, it's not usable. I had to return it."
2,"Good for listening, not for talking.","I've used Plantronics headsets for years. I was surprised that there was no volume adjustment for the Mic -- every other Plantronics headset I've used had one. I must have had a dozen people tell me they could hardly hear me in 3 days of use. No amount of adjusting the headset position on my head solved the problem.. I had to pull the mic nearly into my mouth for people to hear me easily.Pity - other than that, it was perfect. I'm returning it."
2,They cant hear me,"Purchased T20, but headset says T10. however, people cant hear me, and I have to yell to be hear. I need my headset replaced to one that can be heard"
1,Talk volume far too low,"I use and love my Plantronics Bluetooth headset for my cell phone, but this T20 for use in my office is TERRIBLE. As others have said, the talk volume is far too low, while the dialing tones are painfully loud. To top this off, I just called Plantronics tech support to see if they could suggest some way to make the talk volume higher, and I was told they have not had ANY other complaints that the volume is too low. I then asked if they knew that the dial tones were far too loud, and I was told that they had NO complaints about that either. Don't they every read the reviews here?This T20 is going back to Amazon. Does anyone have a suggestion for a good headset for a wired telephone?"
3,Serves Purpose,"It worked really well for me. Eliminated background noise like the box says. However, after about 2 months of use I realized that I was no longer able to dial out. I am not really upset because I don't need it anymore. I just wish it would've stopped working within 30 days of my purchase."
4,Works as it's supposed to,It works as specified. It would be nice if the line lights would light whenever the line is in use by another phone. That way you would not intrude on someone else's conversation.Some of my contacts had difficulty hearing me when first installed. It would also be helpful if the there were an amplification volume control on the microphone so that the party on the other end could hear more easily.
2,Made in Japan,"You get what you pay for. Inexpensive but certainly not made for a true wrench-head. Sockets will some day strip and the ratchet may fail but still good for the ""HandyMan"" around the house but not for the ""PRO""."
5,Excellent BBQ Tips & Recipes,"I had to buy my wife a second copy of this book, since she used the old one so much she broke the spine on it.This book has some excellent tips on BBQ with easy to understand methods and recipes.There are so many BBQ books out there that don't deliver. This book breaks down what you need to know and why you need to know it.Tells you how to use your charcoal or gas grill for cooking low and slow. This is great if you don't want to invest in an smoker.Highly recommended."
2,TAMING THE FLAME,"The book lacks pictures. When cooking a new dish,a picture is 90% of the recipe. Did not bother to read, just returned."
5,A must have,Found this at the local library & had to have a copy of my own. Grilling & slow cooking are explained in easy to understand steps. The receipes are fantastic! The best BBQ book I've found.
3,Stop whining,"To all you reviewers whining about the christian elements of the game- Truthfully, would you object to the game if it suggested egypt's pagan theology was true? why is it people only mind ""religious"" themes if the themes are christian?"
1,Dreadful,I was very much looking forward to playing this game but it never worked! I had several people try and find the problem but all gave up and said it was impossible to make it play faster. I have a very new system so I don't think it was that. Maybe I just got a bad one but it certainly wasn't worth the money! It's now collecting dust.
1,"It might be fun, but I never found out.","I read all the reviews and system requirements. It sounded as if it would work well with my Apple G3 (beige) with Mac OS 8.5.Unfortunately, when it arrived, it didn't work. I had QuickTime 5.0 beta 2 on my system. I installed the game with QuickTime 4 translation. It never worked with QuickTime 5 beta 2, so I uninstalled QuickTime 5 and downgraded to QuickTime 4.1.2. It didn't work then, either! It kept wanting missing game files and QuickTime 3, for some reason.After I uninstalled and reinstalled the game and QuickTime ten times or more, I decided to send the Dreamcatcher (the game's maker) Tech Support department an e-mail.All in all, this would have been a fun game if it had worked with my newer software. Just be careful when buying this game and your computer has newer hardware and/or software on it because you may have a hard time getting it to work."
1,Technically unusable on my XP box,"WinXP w/1Gb RAM, NVIDIA GEForce, Athlon XP 1.3Ghz, with the 1.01 update from Dreamcatcher. The software was so buggy that I ended up tossing it after one night - really. The game would sometimes start and sometimes crash with a Macromedia [tm] Projector error. I was never able to use play all of the tapes, even after following a ""workaround"" from DC's web site. Didn't pay much for it, but it was not worth the frustration and this will definitely be my last Dreamcatcher game. No problems with other non-Dreamcatcher games, like Myst III Exile on this box."
3,ROTS on a PC,"Frankly, I'm a little disappointed with the PC version of this game - the graphics leave a lot to be desired, which seems to be a problem with a game labeled ""for PC"" that was developed on a Mac. And, yes, at times they are so dark that I also have to turn off all the lights to see what is on the screen. Also, after a month, I am still waiting for my hints book, so although I started the game, I've had to archive it till when the hints book arrives. And even though I have done a search, I have not found a walkthru on the internet. I do wish the game had a mapping feature - one that drew a map for you as you played the game. I had another game that did this, & it was very useful. My favourite game is still Riven, & I am anxiously awaiting for Myst 3: Exile."
2,"Needs ""Book of Dead Ends"" but is out of print","I tried everything I could think of for this game and could not get anywhere. Finally I looked on the manufacturer's website and found they had something called ""the book of dead ends"" but it is out of print. There are a lot of dead ends in this game, and unless you know how to get from point A to point B, you might want to search the interenet for the walkthrough that I found where someone tells you step by step what to do to get anywhere.Other than that, the graphics are pretty good and you will enjoy the discovery of what's inside the great pryamid and the sphinx (if you ever get that far). If you're looking for every clue to solve a puzzle, you won't find them all because they're not all there (as far as I can tell). But have fun adventuring anyway... all alone with a curse to fall upon you."
4,Riddle of the Sphinx,"This is a well developed, 1st person adventure game. Graphics are fantastic and transitions between 'movies' and real-time action are very well done, almost seamless.The initial video is outstanding and sets the tone well for the opening puzzles of the game.Be sure to have plenty of note paper and a sharp pencil as I found myself taking many notes to retrace my steps and solve puzzles. From the very beginning (the search for the scroll) the search for the pad lock on the sea chest is a multi step puzzle.Have fun and enjoy the view."
3,Not what we hoped,"We bought this Dreamcatcher game after having a blast with Faust: Seven Games of the Soul. We enjoy a challenging game, but this game is too non-linear for the number of puzzles it features. The enormity of the game and the complexity of the puzzles led to days of wandering around, wondering if we were finished with areas (and disks!) or if we would soon find ourselves stuck there again.The scenery and animation were indeed beautiful, and many of the tasks are quite exciting. However, the frustration of deciphering which puzzles are doors to others, compounded by terrible navigation tools, often spoiled the fun. At times, it truly seemed more work than play. And just when you think you've finally gotten somewhere, it's all over."
4,RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX,Riddle is a beautiful rendered game especially for pyrimidologist. Be prepared for some tough puzzles but the effort is worth it. Riddle takes you to Egypt and the pyrimids and with the lights low and the quiet of the night you can start to believe you are there.
1,Nothing but trouble,"I am hoping for a ""Riddle of the Sphinx for Dummies"".I have never had this much trouble with a game in my life.The game constantly stalls (on me at least) and is difficult to try and maneuver through. Would be happy to purchase ""Book of Dead Ends"" if it ever came back into print."
2,Too bad,"Okay, the graphics were nice, the music was dreamy, but this was an incredibly boring game. I almost quit the game during the cheoptronic sequence. Going through that long tunnel for days was unecessary and incredibly booooooooring! I don't mind a puzzle game being difficult but don't bore me to death. I hope Atlantis was better than this. I'm going to try that. It's a shame programmers spend all their time and talent making beautiful scenery and tantalizing puzzles and make the in between stuff so boring you want to quit the game before you finish."
2,disappointing and offensive,"Disappointing because the graphics were often beautiful and the premise interesting, but the technical glitches were too much to bear. Simple navigation was a disaster, the attempt at 3-D didn't work.Offensive because the authors insist on putting their religious beliefs into their printed writeup."
3,You can make a career out of this,"I guess I'm not cut out for the gaming life, emphasis on life. I got stuck in the guy's tent which turned out to be less than 1% of the whole game. Luckily, I found a walk-through on the Internet (nineteen single-spaced pages) and I'm glad I did. Otherwise, I'm sure I would have quit after weeks, if not months, of frustration. It amazes me that anyone could conquer this without a walk-through. They should be working for the NSA. But the work that went into creating this game also amazes me. I don't know how this one compares with other games but I was sure impressed with the graphics, sounds and just the ""feel"" of it seemed right."
4,Enjoyed it.,I enjoyed this game very much due to the fact that the puzzles were well hinted in the game as opposed to having to guess what needed to be done. granted the game was a little lacking in interaction with other characters but if the puzzle clues are available and the game flows i find that more important and this game had both.
3,Just Ok,"I purchased the jewel case version for $9.99, but wouldn't pay more for it. Maybe because I had just finished a Nancy Drew game that I found this game to be somewhat tedious and boring. There were lots of rooms to look through & items to pick up that all looked the same after a while. And the ending was so blah, blah, blah with all it's preachiness about religion. A few of the puzzles were challenging. Like I said, it's just an OK game."
3,HUH?,"I grant you, I have this silly obsession of wanting to know WHY I've gone through how many tombs (all in the Great Pyramid), and for what purpose? All to find out something I saw Indiana Jones do to the Nazi's?Game is kind of interesting in the Egyptian stuff, but nothing other than blind determination - given that I'd paid full price for it, really kept me going. I bought it, and by God I'm going to PLAY it. This should NOT be why one plays a game.Game starts real slow (sound on my copy kept cutting out, but rebooting helped). Collect a lot of stuff along the way.Still, to be fair, I see there is a sequel. Dare I hope. Too many loose ends (Atlantis? Mayans? Bermuda? Stonehenge?)Go ahead and buy it, but there are other ""Egyptian theme"" stuff out there.Game played well, no small thing - all things considered. I do like to think that I've earned doing stuff right so I should get a ""freebe"" on that one - no cut scenes. I'm picky, and it's MY money."
3,Why did they make this game?,I have played this and other like it . I don't like this game becuase there is no interaction and it's hard to move around . I also found it hard to save a game bcause it would put the saved one undera diferent title. If you have played games like this before don't play this one. I liked Dust tale of the wired west bettr than this one. The dreamcatcher people needs to more games that are interactive.
4,A history of the Irish as slaves,"This is an excellent history of slavery imposed upon the Irish by the British government. This history of white slavery is frequently ignored.The first chapters with detailed histories battles in Ireland are somewhat too complex. However, when the author gets to the story of slavery, the gathering of mostly women and children to serve as slaves in Barbados, the writing is excellent.English power under Cromwell clearly did not consider the Irish as humans. The captives were treated almost like animals. The imposition of slavery shows well how an ideology of superiority can turn to cruelty, starvation, and oppression. While we tend to think of slavery in terms of racial groups, this work shows that racial groups are defined (socially constructed). To the English, the Irish were a racially inferior group."
4,work as advertised,"These work much better than the photocell inserts I had in the light sets I replaced. I cut the rubber off the sensors to allow more light to get the most efficiency out of them, not sure how well that worked, but they generally go on about a half hour before twilight.I also don't like the way the bottom spike attaches, it is a 4 piece collection that if you look too close, doesn't really look that good.Overall, though they are good and would recommend them to others looking for dusk to dawn lights."
1,caution,"this game relies heavily on a red-green scale for the placement of industries, farms, and the like.. .. colorblind people (like me) will find that frustrating.."
5,Great game,"I must admit, this is a great game. If you are looking for a game that is fairly recent and you liked the sims, or any sim for that matter this game is for you. It has great graphics, an okay interface, and a lot of entrigue. This game is wonderful, and if you've ever wanted to play castro, here's your chance. On a quick note, the only cons of the game is that its tutorial isn't sufficient and that it's very hard to figure out how to please all of the political factions."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"When i bought this game, I was hoping it would be more entertaining than it turned out to be. ...[the] game ... is extremely confusing with all the political mumbo-jumbo, and crop raising, etc. I am 13 and I thought this would be a fun strategy game, but I was VERY wrong. Sure there are a few perks to it, but not too many that I can think of. ...."
1,Horrid Amazon Downloader,"I really wanted to play this game, but the Amazon Game Downloader and Installer is horrible. My computer thought it was a trojan and I spent 2 hours with the thing trying to get it to work - it didn't and I had to get a refund."
5,Addicting Game!,"Tropico is a great sim game, that will make you loose track of time. You can change how hard the game is, which is my favorite part. (I set it to have a never ending supply of money). You are the new ruler of a Caribbean island. You must keep your people happy by building farms, homes, and providing them with entertainment. I love all the simulation games. The Sims, Sim Theme Park, Sim Hospital, and Tropico are in my top 4 list!"
4,They are making an add on!,Cant wait for the add-on coming in January. This game is cool just wish the game play graphics were a little better.
5,"Creative, intelligent, and most of all FUN","This game can really be summed up in one word: FUN. Because of what others have said about this being a shallow game, I think this deserves a real explanation. I played the game for the first couple of hours, and it kept me really interested, even kept me up past midnight the first night of playing the game. I was a little disappointed at the time, and thought I had perhaps spent too much on such a shallow game. I went back at it later the next evening, and was just taken immediately by the breadth and immersion that the game provides. I really felt ""attached"" to my island and its people as well as its ultimate development and pursuit of a capitalistic society. Tropico will provide you with hours upon hours of wonderful entertainment ... just give it time to grow on you!"
3,Well the intro is pretty funny,"Certainly the packaging is cute with the comic book Castro, complete with cheeky grin, squeezing a couple of beach babes. And the intro will have you smiling to, but there aren't too many other humour injections after that.The gameplay itself is pretty well thought out, though the implications of chosing to play a Commie or a Yank are pretty arbitrary, and there are a fair few elements which are straight-forward repetitive (eg If you get asked whether you want an election and decline you get the same response from your advisor every time).Overall, the potential is great but if the diferentiator between this game & other SIMs is meant to be the humour & the exercising of crazy South American politics, then it doesn't really achieve it's goal. Slightly disappointing."
4,Where's the feeling...,"Alright, this is a very fun game, and I loved making the the perfect paradise(or a military dictatorship, depends on what kind of mood I'm in). The only problem I found was that after awhile it just got boring. Even the different scebarios were mostly the same."
5,Fun,"This game has so many options and choices and different ways to play it never gets old. It is ver creative and you can adjust the difficulty and even the goal of the game to suit your liking. An excellent simulation, the only problem is that the sequel from what I've heard has nothing to do with the original game"
4,Amsuing and not too stressful,"This is an enjoyable game, with a few interesting features. The premise is simple; you are the dictator of a Banana Republic. It combines the play of SimCity (money management, building placement, and infrastructure maintenance) with the resource management of Warcraft (build farms, sell products). In addition, you can personalize your character with some entertaining traits. The few flaws involve some minor graphics hitches, and the lack of serious micro-management tools which might annoy some hardcore sim gamers. All in all quite fun."
2,Gets boring pretty quickly,"I don't think I ever ""enjoyed"" playing this game. I found it to be tedious and repetative. I am a big fan of ""god-like"" games and this is one of the few I haven't liked. No matter how many construction buildings I erected the build time just took too long. Most of this game I spent waiting for buildings to be constructed... and that's pretty boring."
3,You'll Always Lose,This is a great game. Gives you exactly what you'd expect out of a sim game. Not too over complicated either. Big problem with this game is that you will ALWAYS lose. There's always eventually an act of God or a revolution that you can not win against.
3,"Good start, bad end","Ok, if you're thinking of buying this game I would not recommend it uness you like managing things. This game has a few good pros and some really bad cons. For example the graphics in the game are really detailed, but their stale and lifeless. The only fun I really had playing this game was when I first started a game. I enjoyed building up my city with buildings like pubs, farms, and even a hotel or two. The game can even be addictive after you build an electric plant. But what happens once you've built everything and you have a good economy? There is nothing left to do except treat you citizens as Sims and make them start a coup against you. But like I said earlier, get this game if you like games that go on and on without end or something to do."
3,cheap fun...,"For cheap thrills, Tropico is a good game. By now, it can be bought in most stores for around $10. While the premise of being the dictator of your own island is an intruiging one, there are a couple of quirks that keep the game from really living up to its promises.Asassinate a rival political candidate to ensure your victory in the upcoming election and another person instantly steps up to run against you. Kill the new candidate and another volunteers! Don't they get the hint?!The game is too short. You can only rule for a maximum of 70 years. (Isn't Castro going on year 115?) On the more difficult settings, it is almost impossible to make any cool progress in this amount of time. Freighters arrive to buy exports only a few times a year and large buildings take forever to build (especially if they are built away from the center of your town, like airports and hotels)For the price of a cheap dinner out or a few video rentals, Tropico delivers some enjoyable and silly gameplay."
5,Excellent Game,"Its very original, I like it very much. You should play it if you are a fan of any SimCity or Simulator. The creators demonstrate they have enough imagination to cover each detalied aspect of the game. Check some reviews for more in depth information."
2,Decent,"Tropico is a decent simulation of what it takes to successfully run a country.The ease of use and learning is great.The idea of becoming a semi-modern Caribbean Dictator was a nice change from the existing games available when this game came out, however, the game play is not very good. The options are EXTREMELY limited. You have roughly 10 political options to choose from, and essentially your only other choice is building. The buildings are nothing special, and the game clock moves too fast, even on the slowest setting.Maybe the best modern political simulation, but you'd still be better off buying AOE or Civilization."
2,Good Idea Bad Interface,"How a great concept went this bad is unbelievable. The interface is awkward. The statistics are presented in such a way that you are never quite sure what exactly is going on. There is no easy way to change anything, you must hunt around the screen to find anything, for all the micro managers out there it might be worth trying. Soundtrack is good for the first game or so then it must be turned off or a headache will occur. The manual is the type that requires the purchase of an ""Official Strategy Guide."" There are no real explainations in the manual at all. The final problem is the appearance, the graphics were great in Railroad Tycoon II (Tropico uses the same ""Engine"")because there you really didn't have to hunt around the screen to play the game, there was always a menu choice. In Tropico the muddy graphics muddle the mix and just make it frustrating to have to click on the smallest building to change its settings. Wait two weeks it will be in the bargain bin."
1,Blood of Angels is a reprint of Arch Angels,No comment on the content; it was very good when I read it as Arch Angels and couldn't figure out why everything was so familiar when I read Blood of Angels. Then I read the fine print!Norm
2,Not what i though,"The mask was made out of this gauze material and was very thin. i was hoping that it'd be thicker so that i could dip the mask into herbal medicine for my face. i guess i was misinformed. for my intended use, it did not work very well."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this product was made of cloth, i.e., cotton or muslin. I was disappointed to find out they were made from spun polyester. The description of the product was not clear."
3,We know it we love it..but the hidden sugar....................,Wheat Thins have been a favorite snack cracker for me for many a year past.However until this shipment--I have been foregoing crackers a lot over the last three years or so.They taste as good as I remember...and I loved snacking on them...My only problem with these crackers is what I discovered as I read the box after finishing the contents off. It has 4 grams of sugar per serving. This small box has 3 servings. This makes 12 grams of sugar per box....so only eat a portion of it.Still...I will enjoy them occasionally !
5,Okay to Be Grey,"When Grey Mouse begins to feel blue, she tries to change her colors and thus, herself. As the story unfolds, this lovable character finds her true colors--and her true friends!This simple story and its accompanying simple-yet-unique illustrations will appeal to young and older readers alike. Children will love it when Grey Mouse paints herself red, then green, then yellow, then polka-dotted, then striped, and finally flowery. Adults will love the valuable lesson of acceptance of self.For anyone who has ever felt lonely or unsure of herself--or anyone who just enjoys a good, simple story--Grey Mouse is sure to please."
4,How good was Bobby Fischer?,"I find a lot of negative comments about Fischer on the web, but this book shows you the genius of Fischer. I'm only able to get around 20% of the answers correct. It's not a book that will teach you openings, endgames, etc, but it is a fun book to see how you compare to Fischer in solving tactical problems from his games."
1,Pictures are VERY MISLEADING!!!!,"Before ordering, know that you are buying ONE scoreboard and THREE controllers, THAT IS IT!!!! Not Three Screens and Nine controllers."
3,Not satisfied,"This game did not meet my expectations. The graphics are fairly detailed, although the people can look awkward at times, and they never show any expression, plus the team uniforms look nothing like they're supposed to. Doing repeated exercises can get tiring, and I didn't like that you have to lose your morale if you mess up on one thing. I tried to enter diving without any morale - big mistake. I got second place, and did not qualify, while second placers usually qualify. I know that in games and real life, the commentators' jobs are to comment on the athlete, but they seem extremely rude at times. This may be because the game I got was $3.00 and was used, but the game sometimes freezes the computer up, and then we have to restart the whole computer. Most of the game seems like it is just hitting the buttons over and over - I did swimming and my fingers are really sore. Overall, it's an okay game."
1,Private Secretary 3 - Beware,"I was disappointed in the Private Secretary series 1-4. First, they are terribly dated and there are only four episodes on each. I have a lot of DVDs from old TV shows and most are very enjoyable. This series doesn't hold up over time. Beware that if you buy Private Secretary 1 and 2, you already have half of what is on Private Secretary 3 and 4 because four of the episodes are repeated from 1 and 2 to 3 and 4. That should not have happened. If they couldn't come up with four episodes for each one, they should have stopped with Private Secretary 3. I made the mistake of buying all four at the same time. If you think you are interested in seeing this, buy only Private Secretary 1 and see if you want to buy more. It's not a good value to pay for four of these and only get twelve different episodes."
1,same as Red Hot and Live,This appears to be yet another reissue of the same concert recording as Red Hot and Live with a extra song. This is the 3rd or fourth time that I have come across this same strange live recording under a different name or label. This is for hardcore fans only. I would go with Live in San Francisco or Burnin Down the House.
4,Book purchase,"Could not find this book anywhere but on Amazon gave mine to a friend in marital situation, never had a chance to finish reading it myself. Very glad to own a copy again."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this torchiere because I could not find one locally. Paid more than I wanted to (Just found one for $16 at Menards home supply). Worked fine for 90 days then went dead. When I contacted the Vendor, I was told that I could exchange it for the first 30 days, but if it was defective (It wouldn't work), I had only one week from the purchase to report the defect. The Vendor would not offer any remedy for my useless lamp. (I am used to this kind of lamp operating for several years.) I would think twice before buying from this Vendor again."
4,torch lamp,"equipment was what I wanted, however there was a white gooey substance on the cord, not in great shape, but it works."
4,Not bad for the money,"Lamp arrived safe and sound a week or so after purchasing. It works and my only real complaint is when you have it dimmed it hums, sometimes loudly. When on full it works beautifully. As I said, great product for the price."
2,Simply weak!,"Candy is simply a tame attempt to stay relevant since good alt rock was fading quickly. The producer took the edge off the guitars which results in a weak collection of songs. There are a few bright spots, however. Creatures of habit, the best track contains a great swirling melody similar to the beatles. Lies of Hate has a great riff which recalls led zeppelin and a thick melody. No time for waiting is simply a nice, catchy pop song. Blood into a wine is a nice low key ballad with a faint harmonica and mandolins. There's not much else worth mentioning here cause the rest of the songs are simply not memorable."
2,Horrible production of okay songs,"I agree with people in here saying that the producer, Chris Kimsey, sucks and should have his eardrums popped with an ice pick or similar instrument to prevent him from wreaking more havoc. I heard these songs - pre-Kimsey - demos from Pachyderm Studio - that were much, much better. They sounded good live too - not as good as their early 90s late 80s stuff, but not as bad as this record turned out."
2,Good songs... Horrible production!!,"I am a huuuge S/A fan and I was looking forward to this record because I thought that now they were out of the limelight, they might make a record for themselves and not for mtv. When I first heard it, I was very disappointed. However, I saw them live in Chicago and I realized that the songwriting and musicianship is still there... but Chris Kimsey's production s**ks!! Maybe S/A are to blame, but the recording doesn't come close to capturing the strength of the material... this record could have been as strong as their past records, but instead it sounds like a weak Eric Clapton record. Oh well. But, DO NOT LET THIS RECORD DISSUADE YOU FROM SEEING THEM LIVE... THEY STILL ROCK!!"
1,This was so bad I threw it out,"I hated this Cd so bad I threw it out...What happened to Soul Asylum...They were one of my Favorite bands and Let the Dim Light Shine Rocked...This one Sucked, It wasn't worthy of a space on my CD rack...Oh well everyone has bad days I guess."
1,the idey says what happened,"oh man, what happened to soul asylum? I liked let you dim light shine, it was quirky and a little different. This new one is boring. I'm sorry to say it but what happened? Soul Asylum is one of my favourite bands. Hopefully the next one will rock but i'd skip this one."
2,This was probably there worst album,"After a Fantastic album of Grave Dancers Union they fell not very far. A follow of Grave Dancers Union which was Let Your Dim Light Shine was excellent. They had big hits from those two albums like Runaway Train, Misery, and Just Like Anyone. There new album Candy From A Stranger is Mush songs. It is not like the Punk music like they used to do, and thats what everybody likes."
4,*The* classic book defending animals,"Animal Liberation is widely considered to be the book which launched the modern animal rights movement.For this reason alone, it is required reading for people both for and against animal rights.Contrary to popular belief, Singer does not advocate rights per se, but rather supports a utilitarian philosophy. I have some problems with this, as Singer's utilitarianism does not provide the absolute protection a rights philosophy would. However, Singer argues strongly against factory farming and vivisection--in many ways, his views lead to the same consequences as animal rights does.Singer's critique of speciesism is eloquent, and in my opinion, persuasive. He also provides extensive documentation of the abuses faced by animals in labs and on farms."
5,A must read,"Whether you agree or disagree with the idea of animal liberation, this is a must read for anyone who changes the motor oil in his car, waxes her kitchen floor with Clorox, wears make-up, or eats animal flesh. In other words, for a better informed society, we should ALL read this important work. It WILL change the way you look at our fellow animals."
1,A waste of ink,"Animal Liberation has some interesting points on the surface, but the more thought you put into the arguments, the less persuasive and more ridiculous Singer's arguments become. I first encountered Singer's writings in college, and was unpersuaded then. His further forays into ""ethics"" in regards to euthanasia, infanticide, and--recently--bestiality bear further witness to the intellectual and ethical bankruptcy of Singer's philosophy. His is an exercise in extendio ad absurdam from which few, it seems, have managed to divine the absurdity."
1,"Great Work, Warped Writer","First, let me say that I haven't read this whole book, just a little bit here and a little bit there. The reason being is that I won't spend money that would benefit someone I find disgusting. I have read many of his other writings which either exhibit warped logic (beastiality is OK because the animals are consenting) and warped values (parents of children with any handicap should get 6 months after birth to decide to kill them because they aren't ""persons"", and we should allow families to kill relatives with Alzheimer's disease or other disorders if they decide they are a burden- they aren't ""persons either."") Just goes to show, a brilliant mind can find words to justify anything. I find it interesting that animal rights advocates put him on a pedestal while overlooking the less desirable ideas from this Princeton philosophy professor."
1,Environmental Propaganda - A Cornerstone,"I read this book at university. I grew up on a sheep farm in Australia.When Peter Singer wrote this book, in an Australian University which would have benefited enormously over the years from what was once Australia's greatest industry - Sheep - he had not yet told the world that he had no ethical objection to non-exploitative bestiality. You heard it right - when Mr Singer says he loves animals, he means it.Peter Singer is a moral relativist. He wants us to not only eliminate racism, sexism and homophobia, which concern humans, he also wants us to stop being speciesist. That's right. Next time you swat a fly, your a murderer.Peter Singer is part of a movement which wants to get rid of farming, mining and forestry, but which is happy to have food to eat, warm houses and a roof over its head.We all care about animals. Its just that some of us happen to not be extremists incapable of living in the real world."
3,"Boring, but a landmark book in the field","This was one of the required texts for a joint law-philosophy seminar that I took. I am not a philosopher and had/have little interest in philosophy, but I was interested in animal ethics from the legal perspective so that has some basis on my rating. The philosophy students in the class were enamored by the text and found great pleasure in it. Peter Singer is fundamental to the philosophical argument of ethics as it relates to animal and this book is key to understanding his views. As a novice without particular interest in the field, I found it as interesting as reading an instruction manual. While his central argument is well-founded and is more realistic than some of the other authors that we have read (Regan anyone?), he makes no effort to make it interesting to those outside the field, is repetitive in a way that became annoying, and there were some themes that needed further explanation that he simply stated as fact and moved on."
4,Nice Work,"This is an excellent introductory book on animal rights and the suffering of animals. Every person should know where their food comes from and what happens to your meal while it is still an animal. In addition, the on-going and useless experiments on animals are explained in great detail. Once again - the general public is mostly unaware of these things and this book will really open your eyes if you have not been exposed to these truths. The philosophical section is also not as robust as it could be. However, to Mr. Singer and to most readers - it doesn't need to be!! It is already obvious that animals are capable of great suffering and suffer needlessly at the hands of humans. This fact alone and the examples in this book are enough for most compassionate people who don't need a scientific or philosophical journal that tries to prove that suffering.All criticisms aside this is a fine book."
3,Human Liberation,"Before I read Animal Liberation, I had little knowledge of what goes on behind closed doors with animals. At first, It was something that I almost didn't want to believe but as I read on, it was something that I had to believe. Growing up, I wasn't raised around animals so animals having feelings just wasn't subject to me then and wasn't subject now. But now that I know what animals are put through mentally and physically I have a new respect for every animal. I'm not saying that I'll stop eating meat, or become a vegan over night because for me, that's not possible. But I can say I have a new found respect for vegetarians and vegans around the globe."
2,Flawed Book From a Flawed Thinker,"Peter Singer tries and, as usual, fails. His grasp of ethics is frighteningly shaky for a man whose field is ethics. Singer, for example, trumpets the importance of ""animal liberation"" at the same time he defends in other works the morality of infanticide and bestiality. Singer's entire philosophical anthropology is flawed, inherently contradictory, and, ultimately, leads to grotesqueries (such as his aforementioned support for infanticide and defense of bestiality). Skip this book and pick up _Dominion_ by Matthew Scully instead."
5,Extremely clear and persuasive,"Singer writes in a remarkably clear manner. I am fairly new to the philosophy genre and found this book very easy to get into. Singer does not use any complicated terms so it is always clear what is going on. In terms of Singer's argument, from what I can tell it is air tight. Effectively he argues that animals feel pain-- some more than others-- and therefore we must admit that they have concerns.This is a classic text in the animal liberation movement. If you are new to animal rights, this book will broaden your perspective. If you're already well versed in the animal rights literature then you probably won't get too much additional information from this book simply because this book is the foundation of many others on this subject. Still, I enjoyed the read, and recommend it highly!"
4,the standard (of sorts),"I read this book in high school and it, literally, changed my life. I immediately became a vegetarian. Any book that can lead someone to make such a drastic change (I still, on occasion, crave bacon!) is worthy of your time. For that reason alone, I give it a high rating. At the same time, I eventually found myself no longer impressed by the utilitarian arguments underwriting much of his philosophy, nor do I find such an account that consistent. That is, I need something more substantial than just this book. For what it is, it is a classic and deserving of your time. I think, however, you may move on to other writers for a different approach that may provide a stronger grounding (e.g., Stephen Clark, Stephen Webb, Tom Regan or Carol Adams). Nevertheless, this may be the place to begin!"
5,Absolutely superb,"This is the best book ever written on animal's rights (it should be written that way). I found this a compelling work, and it is for the most part well-written. I have a great deal of admiration for Singer. This book has changed a great many lives, including mine (unfortuantely, there are still too many people who have read this book but who were not sufficiently moved by it, like Katha Pollitt, who said in the Nation that although she read it, it did not even ""convince me to give up steak"". ) I can only hope that the reprinting of this book will continue to inspire younger people to take action against the cruelty against and exploitation of animals. A tremendous book."
1,The worst baterie for game boy ever,"It is a terrible product.It get's memory easy.Memory is when it thinks it's charged but really isn't.It is also a wierd shape.If you ask me get a shock ""n"" rock. I wrote a a good review on it."
3,Okay movie,Um there was alot of talking. like it says its a documentary. but seriously there was way to much talking and barley any drifting. in the end they start drifting alot more and stuff. i mean its a good movie. but not as good as i thought it was gonna be.
2,Doesn't work inside my car. But other more expensive ones do.,"For some reason when I plug my phone in with this cable It doesn't play any of the words only the background sounds, don't know what would cause this but I plug in my frayed old belkin one and it still worked fine. It works in the house just not in the car. Be aware if you are buying for your car as it may have issues. With that said the quality of the cable is outstanding, very heavy duty and durable."
4,"Great cable, with a small problem","I am a big Steren Python fan. Their cables look and feel like high quality, and they work just fine. I use them with all my audio equipment.But this particular cable has a problem. One I never seen before, and certainly not in a Steren.The RCA plugs are loose in the jacks. They stay in the jacks as long as there's no pull on them, but the slightest tug and they fall right out. Very strange. As I said, I've never had this problem before with any RCA plug."
3,pretty good,This Systen worked pretty well for me. I enjoy using it. The only down I have is at times it can go a little slow but if I could go back and change what I got I wouldn't. If you get this product you will enjoy it.
4,grate descriptive really interesting,i started reading it cause a friend told me that it was so cool that i must doit i'm not such a reader well really i only read the software manuals when i'm stuck i started it & i cuoldnt stop its very clear easy reading & it gets you more & more in to the story it even makes you belive it's for rel unfourtanly i could not finish it cause i left it in my car & it was stolen i've been trying to find a new copy but as you say hard to find
1,Your money's better spent elsewhere,"I got this originally to get free shipping (I needed to buy something cheap to tip my amount over $25). Even at the bargain basement price, this book is pretty much worthless, I hate to say. Contains such gems as: ""Wear loose, comfortable clothes when you stretch. If your Levi's are too tight, it won't be an enjoyable experience."" (p.16) ""Fruits, vegetables, meats and cereals are all good for you, if you consume them in moderate quantities."" (p.46)Invest in books like ""Performance Rock Climbing,"" ""The Self-Coached Climber"" (this one I wish came out when I started climbing!) and ""Training for Climbing."""
3,Too much Dialogue!!!,"The album could have been great if there wasn't too much dialogue being tossed around... I did like ""destination Unknown"", ""The Time Warp"" and ""Purple People Eater.""Rocket Man Could have been a great tune if the Chipmunks were able to sing it straightforward, rather than having the DAVE bit in the whole song.. I mentioned my favorites, but the dialogue bogs the CD down too much...."
5,Great game!,I love this game great story fun bad guys great game play that kids and adluts will like I have played a lot of games and this is one of the best it even has fun puzzles and great graphics and you don't keep having to fight bad guys that there is no point to in lots of games bad guys just come and kill you but in this game bad guys don't just came and kill you some times you fight them but bad guys don't just kill you. this game you will not just win fast it has a lot of stuff so it will last a long time but it will not get boring really fun buy it if you think it sounds fun you will like it.
3,Trivial Happiness,"Turn to Red is one of the three post GBV sides that Bob released after the sprawling F.A.C.E While decidely minor - I mean if you don't consider yourself a superfan- it does offer many Pollard treats like the cryptic ""First Spill is Free"" and the bawdy ""Struggle With Nature"". Would I buy it new? No! It is slight effort which feels like a one off that reads like a self referential tribute to early GBV sounds with better production and a tad more musicianship. Still it is hard for the devoted fan not to smile when hearing the garage rocking ""Fairly blacking out"" or the bob with horns of ""Bullfighter's Cut""or the classic Voices feel of ""If Not For The Serpentine Rain Dodger"". Good but not for the casual or first time listener. It's overpirced for something so inconsequential and just too short. Still, I am not complaining. No really."
1,Air and Water evaporative coolers sales and service,"I have ordered 2 evaporative coolers from Air and Water directly, NOT through Amazon, and want to forwarn future buyers that the company has no quality control and ship broken products. 2 out of 2 in my opinion indicates poor quality control; each of the coolers was of a different brand and cannot be blamed on the manufacturer. First cooler arrived with busted casing and fan and motor made loud clanging nooise. It was returned and I refused to pay restocking fees. Second cooler arrived yesterday and it does not turn on no matter what power outlet it's plugged into. Now they're squawking about did I try pluggin it into enough outlets to verify it doesn't turn on. Save yourselves the trouble and order from another distributor."
3,"OK, but ....","The steering wheel cover purchased is of high quality material (soft, durable, smooth texture, matching color). However, it is not custom designed for a particular steering wheel (designed by wheel diameter and diameter of the steering ring itself). Design does not take into account the number and width of the steering wheel spokes, therefore leaving sections of the wheel cover not secured around the steering wheel ring by the leather wrapping/tie string. Also, shipping/handling cost was quite high, compared to the value and size of the product."
3,Poor quality leather,I've purchased these leather covers over the last 12 years. I've noticed the quality of leather that is used seems to have gone down. The first one I bought was very close to Italian leather; the last two did not have the same buttery soft leather. I've also noticed that price is significantly more than the first one I purchased....which would be understandable if the quality was the same.
5,Love It,Thats what I am talking about lots of awesome Gospel music i love it i really like this music that gets you into the presence of God it puts you the mind set for praise and worship you think about the many blessings and the goodness of God has done in your life thank you Amen Praise His Holy Name
3,elly kedward,"The first in the series, ""Rustin Parr"" is based on the Nocturne game. The second is not and so is this. If you are looking for more of a action/horror, get the first one. The second and third are more of a info product that explores the legend. I have had a sneak prevue of the games and nocturne and by far they are all good in their style. The Rustin Parr is by far my favorite due to the lighting, shadows and fog and the sharpness of the graphics and speech. The second and third are scary, they have a creepy tone to them that many fans will love exploring and finding evidence, kinda like X files stuff. The series are set out in September and will be excellent fun."
3,Just so everyone knows...,"You can pick up all three games, along with both movies and a stickman necklace for around $7 (used, of course). Just run a search for The Blair Witch Experience in DVDs."

2,"Horrible, Please don't waste your time with this ""book""","The reviewer who says this is just another monochrome text book which isn't richly illustrated was right on the money. My review is this: The pictures are in black and white and drawn, the pages are so damn annoying to flip through as the paper is extremely fine and thin and hard to get a hold of. 2 subjects where this book does not cover is no mention of computers or the brain. What this book does mention does so in advanced grammar so the layman will find it hard to understand or comprehend what the author is saying and they will give up and try another subject of the book to find it's no different. All the positive reviews I find suspicious or maybe there all rocket scientists or brain surgeons. Stay the hell away from this book. I'm returning it even though I'll be losing half the money I spent, which is better than using this as a $16 paperweight."
1,Better left in the vaults...,"If you are expecting Soft Cell cast-offs (or pre-The Grid seeds of genius) with this release, don't bother. NOTHING on this disc resembles the work Dave Ball did with Marc Almond in Soft Cell. This is truly a horrible collection of annoying songs - it has no redeeming qualities. WORST of all, it is mastered as ONE long track - yes, one glorious 42 minute plus long abomination, so you can't even skip tracks, but then that actually makes perfect sense since you'd just want to skip them ALL anyway. This has been touted as some sort of ""lost"" masterpiece - it should have remained lost...worst $26.99 I've ever spent."
2,matthew,"When I received the product I could not log on for one week and still can't, and six customer service helpers later I still can't get on line and four days later no replacement of the old one as promiesed so next is to contact the big boss of cidco and let him know my problem befor the A.C.L.U finds out a Cancer patient was taken for a ride by a big Company ! Think about it!AS to the Product it is better looking than the Landel mailbug I think !"
3,You need to know what you are doing,"While these can be a very useful device you need to be careful about where you buy and what you buy. Many of the older MIVO 100 can be set up to use any dial up ISP but later ones are locked to Earthlink and it seems they are discontinuing their service. I bought two on eBay for $10 ea plus S&H; - these are the models with the Yahoo function (now abandoned) and I can configure them to my local ISP. If you need support there is a Yahoo group which supports them (search for 'mailstation') where tips are swapped. Models other than the MIVO 100 are unlikely to be configurable as is, although work is progressing on reflashing all models so they can be used as a small computer as well as a mail device. BTW, they also have a send only fax system built in which can be used no matter what.All in all a device with potential . . . . but!"
1,DOES NOT WORK,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IT HAS NO MORE SUPPORT- ALL THE REVIEWS THAT ARE GOOD WAS FROM 1999 & 2000 (THIS IS NOW 2009) IT WAS GIVIN TO EARTHLINK AND THEY NO LONGER SUPPORT IT! I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 82 YEAR OLD FATHER - PEOPLE WHO SELL THIS ITEM ARE THIEVES.
1,Being Phased Out after 2011,"Earthlink Support DwindlingFor a period of time after production of Mailstation hardware ceased and Earthlink discontinued the sale of the devices, the company still allowed new customers to sign up for the Mailstation service. At some point prior to early 2011, Earthlink stopped accepting new Mailstation accounts, and will not transfer an existing Mailstation account to a new device.[1] This implies that while Earthlink continues to provide the service for existing Mailstation customers, the number of Mailstation accounts Earthlink services can only decrease as customers voluntarily cancel their accounts and/or the physical Mailstation devices still being serviced fail."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought a used Cidco machine to replace the one Mom has used fo 10 years. She loved the Cidco mailstation.The used machine was exactly what she had, but the batteries were corroded, the previous owners info was still on the machine, & she could not gain access for use. She called support for help, but they could not figure out how to change the user either. We are sending the machine back, very disappointed. We have to pay shipping charges to return a machine that is misrepresented. I have found out that Earthlink will not sign up new customers."
1,No ISP; don't buy,I have owned many makes and models of mail station the past 12 years and currently there's no ISP for this gadget. Although nice and easy and well made; if there's no service for it then why buy it ? Earthlink made the orginal makes/models and then was bought out buy Cidco but again there's no connecting existing service for this obsolete gadget; don't buy something you cannot currently ( in the year 2012 ) use.
1,Earthlink mailstation,"I bought this product and found out later that Earthlink is refusing to hook up any new mailstation to their service. They are trying to stop using this kind of service anymore, because this kind of service is phasing out."
1,Terrible service & support,"Don't bother with this piece of junk, I'm very surprised to see it still listed on Amazon. Earthlink service and support is terrible, Google ""Mailstation"" to read the current status of Earthlink and Mailstation support. My mom had one of these years ago, and it worked fine back then, but Earthlink has all but discontinued support for the thing and getting problems solved is impossible. Google for alternatives."
1,Poor customer support,I gave the mailstation to my brother in Kansas for a gift. He had problems when he opened it and tried the customer support line and got a machine. He has yet to reach a real person and its been several days. Also we found out there aren't very many local access numbers in Kansas (none that aren't long distance for him) so check that carefully before you purchase. I tried to find that out before I sent it but the email customer support never answered my question. So although the product itself might be good (we don't know) the customer support is bad. We'll be returning the product.
3,Mailstation,Wonderful little machine. Great idea and easy to use. Problem: very hard to read for older eyes. I bought it for my elderly parents so we could keep in touch by email. Had to return it due to serious eye strain.
1,No longer available,I bought this for my mother seven years ago and she has loved it. Her current machine is wearing out and we purchased a new one for her but when we contacted Earthlink they informed us that they no longer activate the machines. They will continue to serve the ones already activated but not new ones. She is 87 years old and it is perfect for her. She is so disappointed- she loves her emails. Now I have to find something new for her.
2,Poor access,"Bought this for my daughter in Hawaii. Great way to keep in touch with friends and family, right. Wrong. She can get in maybe 8 sentences in an email if lucky and only to certain people. Friends who have urls other than aol or earthlink are out of luck. Her attempts at customer service have been fruitless, until she told them she was shipping it back to them. Then there was all kinds of help, but too late. Frustrating to her and to us. Now, it comes back to us to try and get our money back on it. Didn't get a rebate either. That's another story."
1,limited access numbers available,I bought the e-mail station for my mother for x-mas thinking it would be the greatest gift. Well she lives in Hertford North Carolina and everything is long distance. being she is on a limited income we have to return this product and buy a different one that provides a toll free 1-800 number
2,Useless compass,"The compass is useless. The manual says ""1 degree precision"" but by tilting it only slightly the direction changes wildly, by 30 degrees or more.Calibration has no effect on this."
5,Great,"We bought this book 3 years ago for my first and it really helped with his vocabulary. It was misplace so now we are buying it again. Worth every penny. Great for travel, small and light."
2,Great images but not enough paint!!,"I bought this calendar for my niece (7) and nephew (9) for Christmas. They loved it and started painting right away, but soon found out that the tiny amount of each color paint provided is not nearly enough to complete all four canvases. I called the publisher (212-254-5900) to ask for more paint, and they were willing to send me only one more set of paints. I estimate that my neice and nephew will need at least three more sets of paints to complete the canvases.I could tell them dozens of times to ""use thin coats of paint"" but they are only kids...."
2,Elementary My Dear,"I bought this book, thinking it may add spice to my already good sex life, but it was pretty basic stuff. Not exactly what I had in mind. I was looking for something with a little more pazzaz. Oh, well."
4,great value,"I'm a semi-pro jazz pianist. I own an old Balwin baby grand and a top end Roland rd700sx keyboard. I bought the Casio as a practice keyboard at my summer home. I couldn't be more pleased with it. The action is very heavy (a good quality) - heavier that either of my other pianos, but not as much as your average Steinway grand. But the action is also very responsive and quite a pleasure to play. The primary piano sound is balanced and nice to listen to (the others not so).The tone is no where as beautiful or as expressive (wide dynamic range) as my Roland, but the Roland cost 4 times as much!.It is very useful for practicing and the built-in speakers are loud enough to play in a party setting. I've used it for gigs with a stereo amp and it's very adequate - and weighs 27 lbs. I've seen it selling for less at other online musical instrument sites so check around.All in all a very nice keyboard and well worth the cost."
4,i like it,"this is a nice piano. it has a really nice, full sound to it. i bought it so that i could practice on it instead of my console. it is very similar in nature. the keys on this one are a little heavier than my console. it is more than loud enough. i couldnt outsing it in a million years. i typically never go over 40-45% on the volume. i have read reviews about needing an amp for this piano, but it isnt necassary. it is ideal for practice and i like the piano tones(i never mess with the others)."
1,waste of money,"I bought these pillows as a Christmas gift for my fiance who definitely needs new pillows as his are old and have completely lost their shape. I have always had down/feather pillows and he loves mine. I thought these were a great deal and bought them for him. However, once they got here i was greatly dissapointed. Even if you stack up all 4 of them, they squish completely flat and are worthless as pillows. Plus, the feathers are of very low guality and are mostly hard quills that stick you in the face. I promptly returned these the next day. Please don't waste your money on these pillows."
1,Bed pillows,Not worth buying. Pillow flattens out as soon as your head hits the pillow and it is noisy.
1,Not worth it. Spend wisely on soemthing else.,"These pillows end up being cardboard wafes when laid upon with your head, even when you have all four on top of each other. This deal was too good to be true."
5,Indispensable for All Who Write,"Though some may believe that this guide is only for editors, publishers and writers, I insist that anyone who takes pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) buy this book. Clear and helpful, ""The Oxford Guide to Style"" (I know that this should be italicized, but Amazon.com doesn't seem to process HTML) logically breaks down stylistic and grammatical information. The lengthy index adds to the book's ease-of-use. Every section is clearly titled and arranged in neat paragraphs.The only problem that I found was in the foreign language section: the guide neglects to insert a space before colons, semicolons, question marks and exclamation marks in the French section.This is interesting to read or skim, and I continue to use it as a reference."
1,sloppy shipping,I presume the contents of the packages are up to Depends quality but the shipping by IROAMS is unacceptable. Top and bottom flaps do not meet and it is loosly taped. Leaving an open box in snowy weather? The invoice was still hanging on but barely I have never had a conclaimpt with NorthShore and their discreet and TIGHTLY taped paking. I do hope they are still available!Depend Underwear Extra Absorbency Size Small/Medium Case/80
1,Terrible Tempest,I carefully read the instructions and prepared for my first use: oil heated and then the thing cut off. Tried again and again all to no good. When I attempted to drain the oil -it leaked out over the kitchen counter. When I attempted contact with the company - no response from T-fal or from Emerilware. My son uses his all the time and loves it.
2,Doesn't work after 1 month,"I bought this fryer 1 month ago and loved it. It worked great. Then suddenly, it stopped working. The heater would no longer heat. It is only 1 month old. I have had to send back the part, at my expense, to have it looked at and replaced. Very dissapointed. I also didn't like that the lid isn't attached to anything. Whenever you remove the lid to get anything out, you have to place it on a towel or something to keep the oil and hot condensation from dripping everywhere. Again, not great."
3,huge mess,"How do you get a hang of this thing? What a mess!!! It fries very good but clean up?!!! We spent the last 2 hours cleaning up a mess it left all over the place!!! I waited 3 hours as suggested and flipped the switch to filter the oil. It is a good thing I did not go to bed. Half of the oil was on the counter top in no time me and my husband spent almost 2 hours and a roll of paper towels to clean up an oil spill. I heard something about a problem with an oil drainage, but I did not think it was going to be this bad!!! Emerylware practically destroyed my kitchen! now What?"
2,think twice,"I thought this would last longer and be more reliable with Emeril's name on it - not the case. I purchased two of these for Christmas 2010. The warranty is only one year, and of course it broke after that year. No user parts are replaceable."
2,Emerilware deep fryer,"This fryer has a few problems that make it unsatisfactory. First, you can only set the temperature of the oil within ranges and not exactly. This makes perfecting or exactly following recipes difficult. Secondly, the fryer is pretty shallow, good for french fries and jalepeno poppers, but struggles with larger items like chile rellenos or fried chicken. Finally the oil draining mechanism has a habit of leaking, which requires cleaning up oil spills which is always a pain. Beyond these shortcomings it works fine."
2,Dissapointed,After using the deep fryer twice I notice the high temperature of 374 was not being obtained. In fact the temperature at the high setting only reach 340. Several things we fry need the 374 temperature. I sent the heating unit back and am still waiting for a new one to be returned so far it has been 3 weeks.Follow up-Still have not recieved my heating element back and T-Fal did not know when I would get it. If you purcahsed this unit I would make sure that your oil is reaching 374 degrees. (1-28-09)
4,Performs as Advertised,"This fryer works as advertised, No problems. The casework is a little chintzy but it does yhe job."
1,"Save the box, the receipt and get in line at the post office... you'll be returning it!!!","The fryer is awesome! Good heat, no splatter, no messes ****IF**** it works correctly. Mine worked perfectly 4 times. On fry #5 it got to temp, beeped error code 80, resetting it 4-5 times didn't work. I let it cool down, then drained a 1/2 gallon of oil down my range, all over my kitchen floor and got to spend the night cleaning.I wouldn't want a replacement, this one is going in the trash."
1,Emerilware deep fryer,"Very disapointed...Filled the bowl with oil to MINIMUM. Cooked fine, but after use and while draining, the oil leaked all over my tile counter and stained it. Do not recommend this product. I threw it out..."
1,Do not buy it!!!!,"In a country obsessed with safety this is a product remarkable by the lack of it. If you one forgets to put the lever on the draining oil position, you will have about 12 cups of oil all over your kitchen. The oil leaks as soon as you one place it in the fryer. Very poor materialization of a good idea. I bought it thinking that the draining of the oil in a container would avoid the mess. Once again, do not buy this product, unless you want reasons to try new cleaning products and keep the economy going!!!"
1,Terrible,"I unwrappedthis item, filled with oil and it leaked all over the porch. I now have a big oil stain that won't come out."
1,not happy at all,"I have had mine for about 6 months, worked great in the beginning. probably used about 15 times. now it works when it feels like it and usually wont get hot enough to cook. customer service is totally terrible. And draining the oil, it almost always leaks everywhere. only good thing is its easy to clean. But you don't have to clean it when it don't work. My previous fryer was a t-fal and we just plain wore it out, It worked great thats why I bought another t-fal. very disapointed with this one."
1,Cheaply made,"After the second unit failed, I decided to write a review. I bought the second one, because I like the fryer...when it works.However, I bought the second one of these units in March of this year. The selector switch that allows you to change over to the filter process is made of cheap plastic and has broken already.BTW...I am very careful with the unit.The first unit I bought lasted a little over a year, then the heat control died.On both occasions I tried to work with their warranty department. This was a total waste of time.This company does not know what customer service is about.I do not recommend this product or this company"
2,Deep Fat Fryer,"Excellent operating fryer. Heats fast, easily cleaned.It is flimsily built however. The sheet metal should beat least two grades thicker and the basket should be ofheavier grade metal screen."
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased this item from Amazon and have been VERY pleased with it. The oil draining procedure works like a breeze, making this the best deep fryer I have ever owned. Highly recommended!!"
3,bgfot,"first of all the digital display does not display temp, the original motel from t-fal is much cheaper and will cook the same way,also needs a charcoal filter in the lid not just the screen filter have used it a few times and feel the oil storage is the only plus, paid a premiun for something having emerilware on it."
5,Happy w/product,"This fryer was a gift, which has been enjoyed very much. Product everything promised and more. Very easy to clean, no odor in kitchen when cooking. Plan to purchase two more-one as a gift and one for myself. BAM!"
2,Expensive yet cheap,"I received the Emeril deep fryer as a gift. I really liked it...at first. I have had it now for two years and the touch pad no longer works to set the temp. Don't buy one with touch control. It will cost $100.00 to replace the controls with the element. After only two years of use, I find this a very disappointing appliance by a name brand T-FAL."
1,cheap oil filtration design,The reason I bought this unit was because of the oil filtration it offered. After approximately 10 uses the system failed. The plastic control knob that locks the oil storage container and controls the filtration broke in half. I have jury rigged a wooden wedge to hold the filter valve open in order to allow the oil to pass thru the filter into the storage container. The unit is only good as it's weakest link and the cheap plastic control knob makes this fryer a poor choice.
1,Wishful thinking,"Seemed like a great appliance. I wish mine worked. The indicator light never came on. It didn't reach the desired temperature. Now the leaking part. I'm glad I took the advice about putting a baking pan under it. It leaked over a quart of oil (I measured it for this review). The box says that you never touch the oil. You touch a lot of oil as you do the regular cleaning but then there is the feet, the oil collection container (top, bottom and sides) and then there's the baking pan and maneuvering with that lost quart of oil. Perhaps the manufacturers could increase the size of the oil receiver port. It's going back and I'll try a different kind, from Amazon of course."
5,Great fryer,This machine is easy to use and takes just a few seconds to set up. I like the oil storage and controls. It is relatively easy to clean as the heating element comes out and the majority of it can be washed in the dishwasher.
5,Amazing fryer,"This fryer I have owned since 2006 and it just broke today. I have used it so much fish tacos, French fries, chicken wings, soft shell crabs and for fish fries. I used it weekly since I've purchased it I'm a gourmet cook, It has a huge basket an the self cleaning it also nice so you do not have to replace oil each time.I will be buying a new one after I am one with the review, so I recommend this to anyone, I have even had tons of friends like mine better then there own. I have also owned food trailers with commercial grade fryers an this is very comparable."
3,Mixed bag,"These calipers are generally well built. The sliding jaw has a good fit to its shaft. The calipers have a good heft to them.However, there are a couple of surprising shortcomings to their fundamental purpose as a measuring device. 1st, with the caliper jaws closed together, the vernier scales on not at zero. The vernier shows a reading of about 0.003"". There is no way to adjust the scale to the body. Although you can adjust your measurement by this offset, it is a deficiency for something advertised as having ""extreme accuracy"". Second, there are three adjustment screws that lock the moving jaw to the shaft or provide fine adjustment of the jaw along the shaft. The design is good, but the screws do not move smoothly. They alternately bind badly and move freely. Either the threads on the screws or the tapped threads are poorly manufactured.Info not included in the provided description: these are made in China. The supplied case is adequate but very large for the calipers."
5,Good cop-Bad cop,"Taggart grows on you. Once you get to know the team and learn how they react to various situations, they're enjoyable to watch in action. Taggart is somewhat rough in the best of times, and can be grating to the sensitivities. He's a good cop- bad cop to his own people as well as to the variety of miscreants they deal with. Overall,it's an enjoyable hour."
5,Taggart: series 2,"Great group of actors, great scripts & directing (what more can anyone ask?) -- will continue to buy any more that come out on the market!"
4,Sturdy and Well-Made,"Perfect size, well-made glasses that arrived unbroken. They are good in the hand and look nice. One is wobbly on the bottom, so I give it 4/5."
1,"noisy, clunky, too expensive","This cooler would be OK if it were about half the listed price (if not less), but for the price they ask for you would expect a lot more. The fan is first of all not very powerful, even on high. The plastic is very fragile/brittle feeling, one topple over by the kids and it's sure to crack. It also also extremely noisy, and that accomapanied with loud gurgling sounds from the water pump basically make this thing unusuable if you are planning on having it in the bedroom while you sleep. It might work in a larger family room where you don't care about the noise, but even then it is almost just as effective as setting a bucket of ice water in front of a regular fan."
1,Bad service,"I have no review on the product. I ordered it on July 20th and it had still not been shipped by Aug 19th. Further, Amazon never sent me an email to let me know about the delay. Maybe they are used to people checking in constantly instead of waiting patiently. Anyway, I cancelled the order. BAD BAD SERVICE!"
4,"A bit uneven, but a very good look at the doublespeak","I found this book to be very enlightening. I read it a few months after having left the Christian faith, and it really hit home, especially the method by which fundamentalism is engrained subtlely into a person's mind.The main problem I have with the book is his chapters on Jungian psychobabble. Granted, I am no psychology buff and there may be something to what he says, but the inclination I had was to skip forward a few chapters (and had I done so, I don't think I would have missed much)."
3,Will you miss the best part?,"Cohen does all of us a favor by analyzing fundamentalism in comparison to Machen Christianity (Reformed Theology). My guess is that fundies will miss this about themselves while freethinkers will not take the time to understand that there are indeed clear headed Christians who can apologetically take on the atheist mind.I would guess that any freethinker who takes the time to read a Machen book, which Cohen freely admits is the best of Christian writing, will become a believer. So, read the first part of the book for the accurate history of American Christianity. But, read Machen only if you dare discover true faith!Frankly, I dismiss the mindcontrol dribble as sour grapes. Too bad he didn't follow through at Westminster."
1,Stay Away!,"Being an ardent RH fan, I was curious how this would be done. The old RH game (on my C-64 years ago) was interesting for it's time. This game has graphics that aren't much better than in that version from 1985. The only real difference is the inserted 3 second video clips, having Richard O'Brien say inane things like 'How did that happen?'. The music (except for the 3 added CD tracks), and characters, are horrendous and very unlike the movie. As a game, definitely worthless, even as a fan. As nostalgia, worth only showing that you own another piece of the RH history."
2,NOT THE ITEM THAT I ORDERED!!!,"WRONG ITEM SENT TOME,BUT I'LL JUST KEEP IT ANYWAY,ITS TO MUCH TROUBLE TO SEND STUFF BACK!!!"
2,"""I am The Passenger, and I ride, and I ride.""","Oh dear. Two less-than-stellar episodes in a row here. THE PASSENGER suffers for a single reason, and that is that its central premise is buried so deep inside technobabble that I simply couldn't make myself care about it.The storyline revolves around a ship containing a prisoner and a captor. The prisoner has apparently died, while the captor insists that he is alive, based on the fact that he has managed to fake his own death many times before. This leads to an extended ""he's alive"", ""no, he's dead"", ""no he's dead"" argument, where nothing terribly interesting happens.The only way for me to describe this episode is ""silly"". The plot is silly. The technobabble is silly. And during the story's climax, even the acting is quite silly (though to be fair to the performer(s), there isn't much to work with here). This isn't an episode that you laugh with; it's one you laugh at."
1,I Can't Hear You....,"That is what I'm constantly saying to people when I'm on this phone. In addition, the headset can become unplugged if you don't pick up the phone just right. Once this happens, your call will be disconnected. Very temperamental, but in all fairness, I've had two of the GE 900 Mhz (one with Caller ID and one without) as well as the Vtech cordless headset. All of them have their own problems, but for my money I will stay with the GE.On the plus side, this unit does clip on your belt better than the GE."
5,Note - CT10 does not work with office phones,"I ordered this unit to find out that this works onlywith a single-line phone; meaning a typical home phone.It will NOT work in office environments, where you mayhave to plug the unit into your office phone - whichmay be connected to a private exchange or computer-basedmedia collaboration systems. Plantronics supportrecommended CT50 (wireless) or a simple S12 (wired)for their product lines for connecting to office phones.But all parties involved offered me excellent service -Amazon, HeadsetDiscounters, Plantronics. The phone itselfshould be good - Plantronics know their business. Hencethe 5 stars."
3,Beeps when on Mute (:<),"The ct10 by Plantronics is great except for the beep, beep while on mute. I was told by the CO that you cannot disable the beeping. If you don;t need the mute button the phone is headset is great. I just purchased a Uniden TRUC46 headset which I'm testing which one I perfer. Any comments ?"
3,CT10 ok,"I've had the CT10 for well over a year, and while it is very convient I've always had a couple of complaints. As several have mentioned, the volume control does not get loud enough. Also, when muted, there is a beep every second to let you know you are muted but there is no way to over ride that beep. (There is also a red light for mute which is enough of an indication for me -- the beep gets annoying!)Even with those complaints, the benefits are good enough that I still use it all the time when I work from home.One other point -- recently the headset wire connection to the handset has been giving me a few problems... It sometimes needs to be wiggled to get a good connection. :-("
1,Poorly Built.,"Worked for about a year. Was a nice headset phone, small & easy to use. But then the dial pad hinge broke rendering it useless because you could no longer charge it. Very poor construction. Buying this phone turned out to be a very expensive mistake on our part. Look elsewhere, at anything but this."
2,"25% of the time, I cannot hear.","When I first opened this I praised it with a 4 star rating. Well, after 30+ days I cannot take it any more. The volume in the earpiece is not loud enough for comfort. I am always pressing it against my ear, asking the other person to speak up or just requesting that I call them back on a corded phone. The only time I can hear is the volume fully cranked up and complete silence in my office. Man I love the design and concept, but back to Office Depot I go. I think I will try a Siemens cordless w/headphone attached. I am not hard of hearing.......am I the only finding the hearing not perfect and acceptable?"
1,it broke in less then a week,"This got really good reviews so I decided to pick one up... Now it is fair to say that I just picked a bad apple, and that this IS in fact a good phone. However, The microphone in my phone stopped working in less then a week even though I was very very carefull with it so as not to pull any wires ect. Other then that it seemed ok... But I was skeptical about Plantronics to begin with and Im sorry to say that they have lost my trust completely now."
2,jury is still out,"'Don't know why it makes a sharp, loud noise when the battery runs low. It is both annoying and may be harmful to the ears. The audio doesn't have much volume range. I need a pouch (which I happen to have) to carry the receiver around. No instructions were included with the set. The concept is great though, but needs tweaking!"
1,Beeping while on Mute makes this model junk.,"I have one of these and I hate it. I can't mute it and focus on my call because it beeps every second while in mute mode. Fortunately this one isn't available, but if you find one don't buy it."
5,This works great,It is very handy to have the keypad on the portable unit that is so light weight. The headset works good too.
2,"For a C-note, this thing's not worth it...","SO far, this thing is hit or miss. There are many times when I turn it on to make a call, and I can't hear a dial tone. It seems like I need to push the button a certain way. Other times I'll answer a call, and people on the other hand can me, but I can't hear them. For the dough, it's of fairly cheap material. When it works, it's great...I just hope I can learn the ideosynchrocies of this unit soon...Good luck!"
3,Good & Bad,"As much as I like the phone, I have only small complaints. The Key pad is extremey small, hard to read & the keys are the same color as the battery pack unit, so they are very hard to see. Big fingers may press multiple keys at the same time. Also the belt clip to me is worthless unless I stand the whole time. As soon as I sit or bend at the waist-boom the phone is on the ground or on the chair.Over all-I like it very much & use it often."
2,Plantronics CT10 900 MHz Cordless Headset Telephone,"I bought this to replace my $50 GE hands free phone that I bought at Best Buy. I admit I wore it out! I thought I was getting more for more. Not true, I think the GE product was far superior to the Planitronics. I was quite surprised I expected this to be a better product.! Before I bought this phone I searched for another GE hands free and couldn't find one. My complaints with the Planitronics are mostly to do with lousy reception, it often beeps when I have it on a table next to me, never mind putting it into my pocket and walking around with it.... I'm looking to replace this product with something superior."
1,Not a good value,I have a home office and bought this phone a few months ago. The headset is very cheaply designed and the volume is terrible. If you are near any noise at all you can't hear. Any time you bump the cord there is severe static. Then after about three months of use it broke completely. Just stopped working. This phone was so bad I feel lucky it didn't manage to actually injure me!
4,Good phone but without the headset!,"Bought the phone..it's great for work as it is hands-free but I had to substitute the headset with a cell-phone headset as it did not work well and there was some disturbance. With the cellphone headset though, it works great and I love the phone!!"
1,Poor quality for a high price,"Like many of the other reviewers, I found many problems with this phone. There was an audible hiss as I used the phone, even after I plugged it into different phone jacks. The headset cord needed to be jiggled to keep it from getting static crackles if I moved. The belt clip kept popping off whenever I wore it. And you certainly wouldn't want to use this phone for incoming calls since you have to fumble around with the headset and touchy cord connection. I prefer using my cordless phone with the headset I bought ...--the reception is clearer, the volume is easier to control, the phone stays clipped to my belt, and it cost less."
1,Disappointed,I am so disappointed with this phone for two reasons: the phone volume is very low and can not be adjusted and the mic often makes a high-pitched noise.
1,I can't hear you!,"Good design, easy to use, but the lack of a functional volume feature makes this product an absolute failure....keep the packaging because you will be returning this item."
1,Drops calls,"I bought this to replace a wonderful GE 900 MHz cordless.phone that quit working but is no longer made.The Plantronics works great -- as long as you're in the same room. Leave the room and it drops the call. If I wanted to stay in the room, I wouldn't have bought a cordless phone."
2,Not the best from Plantronics,"I'm a huge Plantronics fan. Their products and customer service are first-rate. This phone, though, is sub-par. Mine, at least, discharges too quickly; loses its speed dial settings when it discharges; has poor, staticky sound; and doesn't charge reliably on its stand. I recommend paying a little more for the CT-12, which is very good."
1,can't hear,"This phone was very small. You could hardly dial the numbers. Also, you could not hear through the earpiece very good. The last phone I had a GE you could adjust the volume so you could hear better. I thought Plantronics would put out a much better product than this at this price. If you want a phone that you can hear on buy the GE that's what I did to replace this."
5,Still Hilarious,"While I found the direction of the second series not quite as fresh as the first, it was still brilliant and worth every penny."
5,Fantastic - Gervais Best Work Yet.,"Ricky Gervais takes 'Extras' up a notch and makes Season 2 even better than the first. Andy Millman gets his wish to be a star but ends up selling himself out in the process, which makes the struggle for success that much more entertaining. There are more/bigger stars in Season 2 but it's really the shows writing that makes it enjoyable. Everyone gets to punch Millman while he's down and the cast works so well together you'd think it was a documentary.I love 'Extras - Second Season' the most of Gervais' work and the DVD has some cool bonus features such as Gervais and Stephen Merchant walking you through the process of the story development and shooting."
1,NOT YET RECEIVED,"4 weeks and have not received anything, the other item i ordered a book came very promptly, but am still waiting for my Extras DVD."
1,Second time I received the same titled dvd defective,"About 6 months ago I ordered the Extras complete series dvd package & season 2, disc 1 would not play. Last month I ordered just the season 2 dvd package and disc 1 would not play. Is this some kind of joke, I feel that I have been taken advantage of, not once but twice. You would think that after the first time this problem would have been corrected and the buyers would have received a playable dvd (seller replace the dvd)."
4,"great show, great writing",very entertaining...too bad the christmas (final) episode is only available in a cheaper box set for the entire series! Which is also the cost of what I paid for one season of this show! Andy! Are you having a laugh?!
5,Pathetic little fat man...,Charming...chilling...uplifting...delving to the depths of depravity; i.e. Count F*#@ula. Chubby little loser indeed. Quiet brillance. Well done mate!
3,better than much on TV,"Much darker and not quite as tightly written or funny as season 1, but still more interesting and original than most things you'll find on TV.Though I wish I had skipped the 29-minute extra called ""Taping Nigel: The Gimpening."" It's more than I needed or wanted to know about Gervais, who apparently has a bondage/bdsm fetish which he acts out upon film editor Nigel Williams who doesn't appear all that comfortable with the prospect...one can't help worrying that he puts up with being bound (by tape, etc) into also sorts of painful and humiliating positions simply because he's got bills to pay OR he is star struck. Then again, perhaps that's the point of this exercise: that people will allow themselves to be debased and abused just to be close to ""stars."" A little too weird for me."
5,Great Product!,"I'm a newbie with online shopping as I was always skeptical about the process and the products.Product quality is Great!!! It has NO bad chemicals (i do my research before buying skin products) and it works great! I have sensitive skin , but it does not irritate at all. I'm so happy with my purchase, I noticed it DEFINITELY helped with my acne!!! whenever I read reviews like this one I wrote, i get skeptical about their legitimacy. I'm telling you. I REALLY AM HAPPY :D)"
3,nice,didn't use it continuously though. I still have oily face after few hours of use and the pimples are still there. Best thing i like is that it's very gentle and would never burn your eyes. No tight feeling after washing your face.
3,okay,"this wash is okay. it did not do anything for my oily skin or acne. it left my skin feeling soft and clean, but nothing amazing. i did not use it up however, i remember throwing it out. the price is great for the amount. its good but you know nothing ""wow""."
3,A far cry from their eariler style,"With their third album Louisiana's Le Roux not only dropped Louisiana from their name but they abandoned the bayou flavored rock of their first two albums (the debut ""Louisiana's Le Roux"" and its follow-up ""Keep the Fire Burning"" -- both out of print) for a more generic arena rock sound. Gone was the soul, r&b, country/rock, Cajun romps of their earlier sound and in its place were guitar solos, and other stamps of groups like REO Speedwagon, Journey, Foreigner, etc. To be fair to the band their version of this style was significantly better than those band (and others like them who had much more commercial success) but if you were a fan of those first two albums you might want to proceed with caution before getting this one. Too bad the first two aren't available on CD."
3,3 CD's for the price of one,This is the first three CD's of Anberlin for an unbeatable price. That is one thing that makes it great. If you are an Anberlin fan you should enjoy. If not its a good alternative Rock band to try out.
4,a PHENOMENAL bargain on nearly all of the best songs by Anberlin,"I came appreciate Anberlin after they peaked, so when I went looking to buy albums, finding this 3-albums-in-one offering was a no-brainer. 33 songs that I like for $15? I'd do it again without hesitation."
2,2 stars for 2 great songs...,"Man I wish I would've listened to the preview tracks in iTunes before purchasing the entire album. I found these guys through purevolume.com and downloaded both ReadyFuels and Glass to the Arson. Having become obsessed with both songs, I jumped and bought this entire album with high hopes. Glass to the Arson is hands down one of my favorite songs of this year. These guys can rock, that's why I'm so disappointed with the rest of the record. I wasn't expecting heavier, just better. The other tracks on the record are just mediocre...the production is there, but the lyrics and creative writing sure as hell isn't. If Anberlin releases their next album full of energy similar to the two tracks I have listed, I will give them another chance..."
1,Christian?,"By the lyrics alone, I have absolutely no idea if these guys are christian. As far as I'm concerened, there just another band trying to crossover into mainstream music. I give the music 5 stars though, I've never heard this style before. If you like good clean music without any dirty or violent lyics, then I recommend this cd. If you want to grow spiritually please look elsewhere."
5,Happy with everything,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas, and it was shipped quickly and in great condition."
3,OK stuff,"Well Christian music has come a long way, bands now a days try to equalize the music and the message, (where as, when I was a kid it was all message and some sapyy music behind it).Does it hold up musically? Eh. It OK stuff, and if you are into Christian rock I guess that's as good as it gets."
3,Some amazing songs and some horrible ones,"Man, if they kepy the energy from the first song and increased it throughout the album it might be the best album ever. But with ongs like Foreign Language, I find myself wanting to throw the disc out of the player. I got the T&N sampler and heard that song and thought this band was god-awful. I cantbelieve some of the songs on this album are from the same band. The songs that are good on here, like Ready Fuels and Glass to the Arson are amazing and original. I just think they need to drop the whole pop-punk act and do what they are best at - rockin' the house with energy."
1,Big disappointment!!,"I bought this game shortly after seeing it listed on the top ten games of the year list. After buying this game however, I thought it should be on the worst ten games of the year list! Graphics are horrible, sound is crummy, and the plot line lacks anything interesting. After 1/2 an hour of playing the game, I decided it would be more interesting to go watch Barney with ny 4 year old nephew. It has not re-entered my cdrom drive since. You would be much better off buying Myst which, although more expensive, is so much more interesting than this!"
3,Not a lot of there there,"A very ambitious game, but hard to navigate and harder to care about. Another of DreamCatcher's imports, and it loses a lot in translation, I fear."
1,mislabeled software application,Will only work for Older MacIntosh systems. WIll not work for versions 10 or higher. No patch by manufacture. When purchased it claimed to work with all version for Apple.
1,The Egyptians are Dull,"I was hoping for a good exploration game with little shoot'em ups and more discovery and learning. Instead, here is a game that hopes you will buy the hint book. I did not get very far because I am not good at puzzles. I was greatly dissappointed.(...)Jesus was Jewish, he was raised three years in Egypt and there is no problem with singing the joy that inspires your life and saves your soul. However, that is no excuse for a poorly executed CD-ROM."
4,Love It!,"This game is addictive! You will love playing this game! The realism is great, and you can really imagine what it must have been like way-back-when. Well worth it!"
4,Fantastic early silent rascals.,"Wonderful, wonderful. This is a collection of some of the best early silent rascals episodes from the 1920s. Don't look for Spanky or Alfalfa because they're not here. Instead we have such wonderful personalities as Mickey Daniels and Mary Kornman. Kornman put to shame any of the other later girls, and Mickey Daniels holds his own against Spanky and Alfalfa, even with his bizarre looks! The cast is rounded out with the usual scrappy characters and loses none of its heartiness when compared to the later years. The theme is the same; little kids act like little grown ups and make all of us look forward to going to work the next day. :)For quality of production, five stars. I gave four stars because the quality of prints could be better, as could the score. Neither was terrible, though. Definitely worthwhile to pick up."
4,classics to watch again and again...,"Though these are silent, the expressions on the kids' faces do most of the storytelling. These are classics up there with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Fun to watch."
5,PERFECT SIZED SHELVING,This was easy to assemble and works well on it's side for my purposes. I recommend it for anyone needing unobrusive shelving for any room.
3,Decent but slightly confusing,The product isn't too difficult to put together as long as you realize that they only provide backing for 4 of the 8 slots. I spent a while digging through the box to find my extras and then had to disassemble some to spread them out like the picture.
2,Cubby came with many damaged pieces,"I read reviews before buying from this outlet and I guess I was just in a ""well it won't happen to me"" kind of mood or something because I ordered anyways, despite multiple reviews saying some of the boards came damaged. Well I should have been smarter than that, because guess what? Boards came to me damaged. A little scratch here or there, or maybe a scuff on the back where it can't be seen is one thing, but I received 4 boards that were damaged on the finished side- i.e They are on the front and very easily seen. And it's not like I got the chestnut color, where a crack in the coated finish revealing the dark particle board underneath wouldn't really be noticed- no. I ordered the white. I understand that these boxes are packaged before being distributed by Amazon, but a little quality check on something you're putting your name behind never hurt anyone. Thankfully I have a creative hand and can touch up some of the blemishes, but at $55 I shouldn't have to."
2,Flimsy,"This is a great storage unit for my daughter's bedroom. I filled with fabric drawers and it holds a lot of dolls and tiny toys. However, it chips and dents during shipping. I would buy in a store."
5,Best thing for my needs.,"I needed something to set my TV on in my bedroom high enough to be easily seen from the bed, Something attractive enough that it did not make part of the room ugly. I could not find a suitable plant stand or etagere for this situation, and I didn't want to install a shelf or permanent wall bracket. This unit turned out to be the perfect height for the application. It looks good with the white woodwork, and I have already begun to enjoy using the cubicles for decor, personal items and bookshelf space.And it was easy to assemble, although the package was heavy to haul in off the front porch."
1,Not happy!,I am hoping amazon fixes this. Started putting this together and the more we did the more cracks and scratches we found! This is for my 3 year olds room. I hope he doesnt find the bad parts and start picking at them. I cant believe it is listed for this price with how messed up it came! Not worth $10!!
3,ok for the price,"All 3 that I ordered came in banged up and dusty (packaging). A couple of the long pieces were nicked (laminate scratched off) on the ends and one corner was smashed in a bit. Each piece (inside the box) was covered in dust (sawdust) so be prepared to clean each piece before assembly. Assembly was very easy. Overall, pleased with the way they look. Purchased to go in a storage room so the nicks aren't ""that"" big of a deal, although I would have preferred no damage on something bought new."
3,"Content, not happy","This organizer is the perfect size for all my daughter's books and odds and ends. I had low expectations for quality since I have bought this company's items before, and this product did not dissappoint. But I knew what I was getting and for the price I am content. If your looking for top notch quality stay away from this product, but if you are looking for cheap and moderately attractive storage then this product will meet your needs. It is a snap to assymble and is sturdy enough, although I wouldn't let a 30 lb. child sit on it. As I said I am content(it saved me from building one from scratch), and my wife is more than pleased."
3,"What I wanted, but with flaws.","First, I will say that this is exactly what I was buying. You get what you see.It arrived without a packing box...it was just the product box with plastic wrap over it. Normally I would turn this away but it was left at my apartment's office. I inspected each piece and none of the pieces are damaged or missing, however one piece is extremely flawed. One of the middle shelves does not have ANY white laminate on it....it's just ugly particleboard. Shipping would be a pain to return for a replacement product, so I am just going to deal with it. I got it for a heavy discount, however, and would likely biother with a replacement if I paid full price.All in all, it is what I wanted, but slightly wrong."
3,good solution,"These cubes answered my need for storage,no its not the most sturdy or glamorous solution,but they do the job and putting it together isn't that hard for me anyway a semi handy person."
3,Missing piece solved,"I got the box and read all directions and then went about setting out my pieces. Unfortunately, the company had sent me three of the same pieces, instead of top and bottom and middle piece that was cut all the way through for the dowels to go through. I called the company and informed them of the problem and they sent me the right piece via Fed. Ex. I was most impressed.It isn't a snap for the single girl to put together. It's big so holding the pieces of wood correctly and screwing it all together included several attempts.What I love is that the box is heavy and I didn't have to buy it, lug it out to my car, lug it across the parking lot and up the stairs, it simply arrived at my door.The ""wood"" is actually low grade MDF (medium density fiber) and easily splinters so be careful when putting it together. I'm just using it for storage in my laundry room so it will be fine."
3,"ClosetMaid 42017 8-Cube Laminate Organizer, White","It's ok but for a little bit of money you can buy the ikea's shelve wich is mucha better, more robust an bigger. This shelve seems very weak and you need an extra nails to ensure its robustness if you won't have any surprise."
4,Producer Drew Youngs:This guy Vecchiarelli is happening.,"While I was enjoying a warm evening in downtown Palo Alto, I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Vecchiarelli. perform two of his original compositions live.I found John's CD, Tiny Rooms, reveals John's ability to create his own unique style.I would like to see a remix with the vocal up a bit.A sweetening with Paul Stubbelbine would be nice.To successfully archive one's music for distribution demonstrates the kind of leadership I respect and admire.Peace, Drewbiewan"
2,Disappointing,"Zigby Camps Out, Zigby Hunts for Treasure, and Zigby Dives In are particular favorites of our 5 year old. This book has neither the sense of adventure or the wee bit of peril, which made the others so entertaining."
2,Don't fit my Martins,"It's weird. I have a set of Planet Waves ebony pins, the plain ones, and they fit all my Martins perfectly. Then, I have this set, with the brass dots. They look cool, but, unlike the plain ones, they do not fit. They stick up, and the low E is so ill-fitting that it won't get go in or hold the string down. The slots are just not slotted enough.The Planet Waves ebony pins I have that fit get five stars. These don't fit. :(If you're wondering about sound, it's not going to make a massive difference. Sometimes I think I can tell a difference one way or another. I think it's probably in my head, after making comparison recordings. Theoretically, the more mass, the more it should sort of deepen the sound, and wood pins should make the sound ""woodier""; bone pins should have less mass and make the sound a bit brighter and lighter."
1,Dumb down version of a classic tale.,The original film is fairly close to the book and is a classic. It doesn't stray far from the true nature of what happens. HERE they make it cute and fun for the whole family. Gone is any real intensity it had along with the close ties it had with the book.So if you want your kids to remain naive about sad events and situations that deal with real life then by all means get it.However if you want a classic that will leave an impact then get the original movie or better yet the book.If you want any more reasons to avoid this well the animation is bad compared to the movie that came out in the mid 70s and so are the voices.
3,"Neat For Nostalgia, But Overpriced","This product looks good and sounds OK (not hifi by any means). Two big issues: The drop down lid in the front will break almost immediately - use velcro to repair. Their remote, controls far too much - if it is defective as was mine or is lost, means many of the features can't then work. It is a good value at maybe $175; a bit too pricy at $275."
1,A real disappointment,"I was looking for a radio that would be visually interesting AND provide good sound. Unfortunately, this product possessed only one of these two qualities. The Crosley WR18 Mini Bubler provided visual interest, especially when all lights were turned on and bubbles rolled through the tubes surrounding its face. On the other hand, sound quality of its internal speakers was poor. I probably would have retained the product inspite of this deficiency, but after only three days the CD player locked and trapped a new CD in its tray. Thereafter, I was unable to switch the player to radio mode. I had no choice but to return the unit for a full refund."
4,Economics Book for Managers,This book is a very useful tool for future managers as it describes the basic economic principles of Economics.
5,Beard-life is the good-life.,"I'm not grey, I just have some lighter hair in my beard that can make things look a little splotchy. This takes care of the issue well. The color looks natural, as long as you choose the right color for you. Someone complimented my beard the other day. I've never had that happen before! I think this Just For Men Color pack is part of it!One more plus: you get three of these. Check out the prices at any of your local stores, you might pay the same price for just one of these there. Now I have color for a long and complimented beard-life!"
2,a different alternative,"Let's all face it! It's all about trying to look younger. I had a beard for almost 18 years and when I cut it (leaving only a mustache) I looked five or six years younger. Slowly the mustache became more and more gray as the years went by and I thought about coloring it. I even bought this product. But I never did go through with it. Instead, I shaved off the 10 year old mustache and to my surprise, everyone is telling me I look younger, again! Now I just have to figure out what to do with my salt and pepper head of hair!"
4,I've used this for several years,"As a long time user of this, it has been very effective. It seems to have a limited shelf life after opening. Towards the end of the tube, it tends to lose effectiveness."
3,"Good, but there is a better option","This works okay, particularly if you are just coloring a mustash. However, there are only a few color choices so you may need to choose a color that is too light or too dark for you. If you are coloring a beard and mustash, it requires the whole tube so you only get one application of this product per box.However, for beard and mustash there is a much better option at about 1/10th of the price: I use Revlon Colorsilk. It has no smell / no ammonia, there are many more color choices than there are with ""Just for Men,"" and it works great. The only disadvantage is that you have to leave it on for 25 minutes, rather than 5 minutes."
4,"Good product, but need more color developer in package","I use equal amounts of the color and the developer, and run out of developer every time. I have 3 partial tubes of color base in my drawer! Not happy about that. I have a mustache and a stripe of beard down the middle of my chin, and I get 2 apps per box. That's it.The product works well. Here is some advice. When you shower, use baby shampoo ONLY on your beard. It'll fade quickly otherwise. Also, a lot of sun kills this product. I ride MC a lot. I might try using 50 spf sunblock. I'll post back if it works."
4,More play with No Gray,"My beard went gray early and I was vain enough to keeping fighting this losing battle. This light blonde color is perfect for me and goes on easily. It's not too dramtic a change to be so obvious and lasts for 10-days to 2 weeks. Yes, you will be buying this for the rest of your life or at least until you finally give in to the gray. NEVER!goes on easily, no skin reactions, nice color match."
2,Effective if you apply it several times... but then not a great or lasting color,I had seen several bad reviews here about it not applying well. I tried using it every week for ongoing facial hair and I also found that it was not applying well. It would take 2 or 3 applications in order to be even. Then it would not look very much like true color but would have a bland look to it. I tried for a few weeks and gave up on it. It was taking too much time and not looking like I wanted it to when I was done. I can't recommend it.
3,Rosenbauer did it better,"Tom Rosenbauers ""Orvis Guide to Reading Trout Streams"" is a much better read with more comprehensive, useful, understandable information. Dave Hughes has a few decent tying books and his ""Small Streams"" book, in my opinion, is his best work, though Gierach gives him a run for his money. Try Rosenbauers book first. You'll be so glad you did."
4,Very nice book,"OK, this was an awesome book from every angle you look it at. The only drawback is the lack of fish porn :P, but its a must for beginners, intermediate and expert fly fisherman's."
3,Reading the Water,"I was unaware that this was an American book, this was no doubt my error but it was not made very clear. However the general advice can be used for fishing English waters."
5,We love it,"Naturally this is so cute, should have this part of your collection. You have to watch it and decide for yourself, it may not be for everyone but we love. We have all the buddies DVD and we enjoy watching them all."
5,Cute movie,My daughter loves all the Buddies movies! This one was no exception. What I love about this is that she wants to learn more about Egypt due to seeing this movie. Whatever works to gaining interests in the world! LOL
5,"Treasurebuddies, cute as always","Treasurebuddies was a very good add in the Buddies/Air bud series. It's cute and fresh. It's worth buying if you, like me, collect the Buddies films. But my favorite still remains Santabuddies.All have been great so far. Airbuddies, Snowbuddies, Spacebuddies, Santabuddies, Spookybuddies and Treasurebuddies.I can't wait to see what comes out next. Some people claim this film is 'scary' to little kids. I find this a bit odd. The 'naked' cat is a real cat breed. And the snake isn't that bad.I think it depends on what your children grew up with. This movie isn't scary, it's completely cute and a classic Buddie film."
1,Ugh...,"I watched this crap with my little cuz. Not even he seemed to like it much... If you want a movie to put you to sleep, this is definitely it. I've seen lots of ""Animal type hero"" movies, and this one is way below quality."
3,It's ok,"We have seen 3 of the other Buddie movies and enjoyed them all. There doesn't seem to be any violence in any of them or bad language. They are suitable for my 3 year old and my 9 year old. The buddies are very cute. This one, although it's appropriate, did not seem to hold their attention as much. I was bored watching it and usually I don't mind these movies at all. The story line was kind of long and drawn out. I would not suggest this to a friend, but the others are great!"
1,My seven year old son hates this move and says it is scary!,"My son loves the Buddies movies and watched Snow Buddies a few times today. He laughs a lot when he is watching them and will watch them over and over! He thinks these are all great: Air, Space, Santa and Snow Buddies.Today he watched Treasure Buddies for the first time and said it is scary and there are a lot of ""really weird parts"". Such as a dog starts to turn into a cat and a cat turns into a statue. He thinks he is going to have nightmares tonight. When I started this review I read the descriptions for each of the ratings (one star, two star) and he picked one star ""I hate it"".I said we could put it away until he is older (we have done that with other ones) but he said he doesn't even want to keep it--that we have to get rid of it. He has never reacted this way to any movie or TV show and I have never written a review this negative. I hope this review can keep other parents from wasting their money on this bad movie."
2,pH paper,"The product is inexpensive but it's not very useful except when you expect very wide ranges in pH. If you want to distinguish between say, 6 and 7, this product will not do it."
5,Great for my many PH needs.,"I use these to test the rain water and to test finished soap and lye solutions for other projects. I never had a problem. I have tested as high as 14 and the paper gets very dark just as the color code indicates. All PH's accurately correspond to their matching color. I've tested countless soaps that are between 7 and 10 and I can see the shade or easily determine if the color is ""in between"" such as a 7.5. I even cut my strips in half to last twice as long. No problems ever. These help me determine when liquids come off my soap whether it's lye or glycerin. They have been so helpful. A must in my house. You can also use these to test your urine or saliva. I've used these to test my homemade wine and vinegar, too and had no problem testing on the acid side either. No problems. Totally 100% happy. Would buy. Great full spectrum strips."
2,Color Coding is a Problem,"I didn't buy this as a toy or an educational tool. I bought it to test the PH of home cleaning products to determine their suitability for cleaning different surfaces in my house (porous stone surfaces, etc. which can be easily damaged by acidic cleaners). Unfortunately it doesn't work well for that purpose. The colors on the chart are not distinct enough and there is one mauve/purple shade on the color chart where almost the same color is defined as both highly acidic and highly base. That was the color of the first product I tested - so it told me nothing. The second liquid I tested turned the paper a bright blue which wasn't remotely similar to any of the colors on the chart.So it might be a fun toy for children to show them the basics of how different levels of acidity turn the paper different colors, but I did not find it useful for actual measurements."
3,Buyer beware,"These strips are ok, but be aware that there are types different strips geared to test different fluids. For example, I would NOT recommend these strips if you want to know your body's PH (urine and saliva)for those I highly recommend pHydrion's pH tape. However, if you are testing chemicals, then these are ok."
1,no stars: defective,"appears to be either expired (no labels on plain clear container) or just strips of construction paper. terrible , awful , worthless (completely) !"
2,3 cheap dimensions,"They could have spent more money on production. The stage floor had a large crack in it and instead of being able to concentrate on the actors my eyes were drawn to the crack in the stage floor, waiting for an accident to occur. they also should hire someone as a set designer, it's hard to believe someone is wealthy when his apartment looks like a project."
3,Written,"It was not what I expected and it did not hold my interest. However, I only watched it one time, maybe I should watch it again before I put it in my video library."
1,Preachy,The movie was rather preachy and the actors did more screaming their parts rather than acting out the parts. i would not recommend.
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this cable for my PSone. The s-video cables that the PS1, PS2, PS3 should be all the same and should work on any of the 3 systems. When I plugged this cable in, the picture would cut in and out and when there was a picture, it would be flickering and have a lot of lines in it. Disappointed. I'm going to try a different manufacturer."
4,S-Video means Super Picture,"This cable seperates the video's color and brightness signal instead of cramming the entire video signal into one RCA cable. If your TV or diplay of choice has the S-VHS input plug, I suggest you pick this A/V cable up. To help you understand the difference this makes, play a VHS movie on your tv, then play a DVD. The image you get from your PS2 using S-Video Cable is comparable to DVD vs. Video. I won't play with out it!"
1,"YOU MUST READ THIS, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE",I bought a PS2 last week and paid for the InterAct S-Video Cable. Let it be known that the cable ruined my PS2's ability to play back DVDs. Do not buy anything for you PS2 that is not made by Sony. I talked to a Sony representative today and they said using any other cable will VOID the warranty on the PS2. Luckily I was able to return my Playstation 2 to the store that I bought it from...you might not be so lucky.
1,S-Video Cable for PS2,"It's better than the sony product, even though its made in china... It would have been better if it was made in the U.S.A., then we would be keeping our economy up and running, instead we make our friends poor and our foes richer. Way to go america! close more factories so we can sell the whole country to china and become slaves! God knows we don't want to stay FREE!(< that was sarcasm... for all the slow people out there)"
3,Really Useful,"If you use up all the A/V inputs on your tv then this s-video cable is very useful. S-video is a lot more uncommon and not a loy of your machines like; vcr, dvd player, n64, playstation, sega dreamcast, stereo dont really donncet to your s-video outlet."
2,These are not composite cables.,"Calling these composite cables is a mistake, composite cables are much better, these are RCA cables and a S-Video cable. The S-Video delivers better picture quality then the regular RCA video cable (yellow cord not shown above and not on this product) The white and red cords are your sound, the other one is the S-video (if you know computers resembles a PS2 connector)"
2,Not a good cable...,"This cable hardly has any improvement over the Sony cable that comes with the PSX and the PS2. If not demagnatized it creates crazy interferance and sends things that look like vertical damper wires all over the screen. You're much better off with a Sony S-Video cable, a Monster Gamelink S-Video cable, or Interact's higher quality cable. I personally suggest Interacts better one because it offers better quality at a lower cost than Monsters. The cables themselves are thin and badly shielded, thus the audio performance is also sub par. The only advantage is the ability to un-join the cables, so you can send the audio to your stereo, and the video to your TV. But you can do that with Interacts better cable, you can't with monster's."
5,Can't Forget,Many of you are leaving out something. You cannot tell people to get this item and thats all. First of all the item is yes great and improves the picture quality a great deal. However you must have the TV to do it. So dont plan on getting this unless you have a place to plug it in. The slot is a circle with dots (kind of like your mouse port).
2,Why no color?,"I currently have three HOT books included this Illustrator CS book. This one is really disappoint one. Why? The book is about graphic, but all the pictures in the book are black and white. However, it comes with cd-rom, so it receives 2 stars otherwise....."
2,"Not a bad book, but it's too dated to be of much value.","There needs to be a good book written about accessing the world by the physically handicapped, unfortunately this one is not very current. While it has a lot of information, most of it is so general it is of little use. If you are an adult who became handicapped yesterday and have never travelled anywhere, you may pick up a tidbit or two. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,Should be titled - Pictures of Ancestral Ships,"This book does provide pictures of probably all of the immigrant ships used, however, there is nothing else besides postcard-size pictures. They are arranged alphabetically, 3 per page, and provide a name, date, and steamship line. I was able to find the ship that my grandmother remembered traveling on her voyage to America, but no other information was available. I believe that the title is deceiving. The description stated that pictures were available, but no mention was made of ""all pictures and no text"". I believe that it is overpriced for a collection of pictures that I later found for free on the internet."
3,Comprehensive,"This book has hundreds of postcard sized photos of passenger ships. The quality varies but they are never excellent. The binding, printing and packaging are all adequate but inexpensive. Surprising for a $35 softcover.This is an outstanding resource for identifying a basic photo and the barest of vitals on almost any ship of its era. But better photos can be had from various musuems and online."
3,"Of value, but only to a few","This book deals with an extremely recondite branch of Bible studies, namely possible problems with the massorah of the Torah printed in Biblia Hebraica Stuttgardensis. For those people who understand what this means and are interested, this book is quite valuable. It gives much useful information from a variety of sources, some of which are very difficult to access.Despite the review by Freedman, the fact that it cites the Snaith Bible is not a problem since Mynatt only uses it as an alternative Hebrew bible to BHS and it would not affect his argument if he had used the Letteris Bible."
3,FMCO DVD Automotive Service Manuals,"I purchased the FMCO 2003-2004 Ford Focus Service Manual Software DVD. The disc is provided in DVD double layer format and contains 7.4 gig of data. Unless you have drive that can read double layer DVDs this disc will be worthless. My at home 1 year old high end Dell could not read this disc. Luckily, I had a PC at work that could read this disc."
5,Breathtaking,"As always, Mary Oliver's poetry simply takes my breath away. It is at the same time bound to earth and ethereal. She seems to be contemplating mortality, as well as the wonder of life as we live. Although one long poem, each stanza is a poem unto itself, each word a butterfly in your window."
5,"We call it the ""Magic CD""","When my son was a newborn, this CD was the only thing that would calm him down. Inevitably, he was asleep by the 3rd song. Therefore, it has been dubbed the ""Magic CD"" in our home. It did magic for Mom and Dad!"
3,"Good book, not so easy to understand.","Gave examples, but at times I thought that to become a STAR teacher, you had not only to conquer the world again, but also you have to fight the complete educational system. And yes, the system has some leaks, but also you will find understanding, passionate and caring people who you can trust. And with that you can win the battle, not by yourself but with other teachers, principals, administrative personnel. At the end the child will be the one who wins!!!"
5,A must for every Bonanza pilot,I just got a copy from Sporty's. I devoured it as soon as I started looking through it.I will be recomending it to my friends who fly the Bonanza. I expect I will re-read it again and again. It also will come in very handy towards making some placards for various speeds and manuvers.
3,"not so ""gentle""","I got interested in Sudoku puzzles through the newspaper, and I felt I had the grasp of it and could solve them fairly quickly when I received this book as a gift. While the introduction to Sudoku was helpful and much more thorough than other books, I was very nearly put off by what they consider ""gentle"" puzzles. I found them quite difficult compared to what I had encountered in the newspaper and on the internet. So I would not consider this the book for a very casual sudoku puzzler but rather someone who wants more of a challenge. Assuming I ever get through the ""gentle"" ones, I imagine the moderate and tough part of the book will go untouched."
2,Poor Paper,"The content of the book is excellent but the quality of the paper it is printed on is horrible. I know I am not the only one who has to use the eraser on occasion, so why use such a cheap grade of paper that shreds so easily?"
2,Not too keen,"This book is no rival to Carol Vordermann's sudoku books. In Mepham's book, those puzzles labeled easy are not so easy. So I can't even imagine how difficult the difficult puzzles will be. And I am a good, fast, logical solver who has done hundreds of puzzles. This book is NOT for the beginner, or even advanced beginner."
3,"Ok, but needed more stretches and details.","This dvd went into a lot of lower body stretches especially for the hips, but only glosses over some arm stretches and nothing really for the chest and back. Trish doesn't tell you how long you should hold the stretches nor does she say if you should do all these stretches as one routine because she does a number of lower body stretches and the sheer number of lower body stretches seem far too much for one session. She doesn't really teach anything as far as breathing patterns are concerned while you stretch either. There's also no mention if you should repeat any stretches as well."
5,A farewell from the dream brother,"The raw, the unfinished, the working, even the experimenting Jeff Buckley, yes, but yet there is so much more to explore on this 2CD-set, showing you maybe another side of Jeff - or - a wider range. Jeff, fallen from the stars,the dreams and the visions of ""Grace"" to our earth, to life, to love, to pain, to the struggle of a unique artist, writer, performer...to become immortal in his very last recordings, waving us his last goodbye. Sleep becalmed...we will always remember you."
5,a brand new skin,"Any review of Jeff's sketches leaves out the biggest chunk of an invitation to listen: his music comes from under the skin, experiments, travels from feet to heart, curved lips, decided jump, Acapulco cliff-diver corazón, little clown, his heart -we love you Sandra Cisneros. His lyrics are naked and a testament of solidarity to us humans and to us challenged young inventive generation. Being awake, we wonder (with sorrow) where he would have taken his music later on, while we sip the barroque taste of sketches. Being sleep we dream of his new power, his new music, the one he was continuosly looking for and his sweet heart draws in ours."
2,Grace is unique!,"The milking of the legacy has started. On hearing this I became convinced that JB would have been a one hit wonder, had he lived.Yes: it's sketches and not fully produced,and yes: sketches from genius are better than full works from minor artists, and yes: there are some interesting sounds that might indicate his direction, but, unfortunately, this just isn't very good.Grace is one of the best debut albums of the decade, but this has to rank as one of the worst follow ups, and one can hardly blame mr Buckley."
1,"Some Clever Lyrics, But Mostly A Bore!","Jeff Buckley had a great vocal range and some nice guitar work on this album, and quite a few clever lyrics, but he is such a bore. Outstanding tracks like ""The Sky Is A Landfill"" and ""Witches' Rave"" show how powerful his lyrics can be, but other tracks like ""Everybody Here Wants You"" and ""Your Flesh Is So Nice"" shows how corny, pointless, and annoying 85% of Jeff's music is.His vocal range is impressive, and his upper range sounsd quite soothing and lovely, but for the most part his voice is an annoying whine, and he sounds way too desperate and helpless for an intimate relationship on his more ""daring and edgy"" songs, yet he sings such songs with no grace, elegance or fire the way Queen's outstanding Freddie Mercury did when HE sang a dirty song. He makes me laugh at how corny he is.Don't waste your money. Buy a few of his singles, but skip this album. This guy has nothing new to offer you or your music collection."
4,Sand back!,"Wow! And this is supposed to be an incomplete album? You have got to be kidding me! The only reason this does not get 5 stars is that aside from the fact that its incompletedness gives it a stark and sometimes unfiltered sound,(which also gives it a refreshingly attractive dimension) the second disc is quite obscure and not all that well defined.Frankly, I think the first disc should have been released by itself. Not a fake track in sight... Like its predecessor Grace, it takes the listener through a spectrum of singing styles from the powerful ballard ""morning theft"" (a truely beautiful song) to a hard and definant ""the sky is a land fill"". From rock to soul to folk to even a slight R&B tinge in the lush ""every body here wants you"" (does anyone pick up a Pink Floyd vibe listeneing to this tune). Music I'm afraid to journey with, for I am afraid I might decide not to come back..."
3,Most of this should have stayed in the vault,"I bought this cd after i listen to Grace which i like a whole lot and i wanted an other cd by him. There are good songs on here espeically the ballads but some of these songs are embrassing. The songs on the second cd are even worse. You should just download songs from this cd like satisfied mind, you and I and a couple others but most of it is a waste. If you like jeff why not try his dad out Tim Buckley happy/sad is pretty good. Another sugestion if you like jeff's voice is Travis's The Man Who. And one more thing can they stop coming out with cds by Jeff most it is unfinished and if he was still alive he would probably think that his after death releases suck."
1,For Jeff Buckley worshippers only,"As the title states, these were sketches for an album which was never made due to Jeff's accidental drowning. These are VERY ROUGH sketches. According to those who knew him, these sketches were nowhere near the state Jeff would have wanted them to be recorded and published. Most are incredibly unmelodic, and Jeff's voice is quite harsh and unrefined on the majority. Despite loving Grace and Live at Sin-E, I found this music very difficult to listen to and with very little worth remembering. It actually tarnishes my image of Jeff."
5,Transparent Master,"Not so incomplete as most suggest.A rare insight into the pre-production process , especially the latter half of disc 2,We see a raw version of a master at work.What makes him great?..... His honesty and lack of self-consciencenous that most of us aspire to and few achieve."
4,As Sad As It Gets,"This album is facinating. It's not an easy listen, but it brings you into it. You feel like a ghost is singing when you listen to this album, a ghost who wishes to sing just to you. Some of the tracks are so un-developed they're painful, but most are beautiful. A well done, if understandably lacking, farewel to a talent who was taken from us way too soon."
4,Moments of raw beauty and gut-wrenching angst,"While Buckley's first full length album Grace presented a cohesive whole, this more scattered (due to its posthumous nature) collection has a range of expression that is breathtaking. Everything from melodic and vocal beauty (Everybody Here Wants You, Morning Theft), to driving, wrenching angst (The Sky is a Landfill, Nightmares by the Sea). The insights granted through the home recordings are invaluable, even when the music doesn't always come together. But that is the greatness of this 2-CD set - it lets the listener in behind the scene, so to speak, giving us a glimpse of a young genius. The tragedy is that we'll never know how great he could have been."
4,Definately worth a look,"Jeff Buckley's second studio album is only half finished but still better than what most of todays pop dreck will release in thier pitiful careers. Standouts include the seductive 'Everybody here wants you' the playful 'Witches rave' and the epic love song 'Vancouver' a 3 minute rollercoaster ride of a song about being the ""other man"". These 3 songs alone make this album worth buying whether you're a fan or not."
5,Everybody here wants you,I got into Jeff's work too late. Everybody here wants you is my favorite song of his and one of the best songs I've ever heard in my entire life. The rest of the cd is just a glimpse of what was inside his head but that song is so strong that I give the album 5 stars.
5,It's Not Grace - But What is Really,"Sure it's not the Grace cd and we will never know if it could have been but this is still an amazing cd.It's absolutely beautiful. However, this cd didn't blow me away from the start but sometimes the best music needs to be mined a few times to find the treasure. His voice is still there and sometimes that's all I need. But there are two or three songs here that match the quality of Grace. Nothing will be Grace but I will take this over half of the crap churned out weekly now."
3,Alright Game But Graphics Aren't The Best,When I first got this game I thought it was going to be awesome and it was. The build your own car thing is the sweetest thing ever. The drag racing is the most realistic thing ever. but the graphics are horrible. I would still buy it. It's days and days of fun.
4,Mega Bloks Mega Fun,"Don't let the first glance fool you. I bought this new set of blocks for a grandchild in another state because the 6 year old who received hers at 1 still plays with the set. They are durable, fun and help develop motor skills. Any toy a child will play with for 5 years is a value!"
4,Good toy but overpriced.,There isn't much to say about the product in general. It's blocks. They're great. But I bought it at my local Toys R Us store for $11 as opposed to the $26 it's listed for hear. You all might want to check that out at your local stores as well.
5,Birth is natural,"The Garden of Eros is a book about a woman who is blind and pregnant. It is the story of her birth and what goes through her mind as her labor progresses. It tells about her spiritual and emotional growth throughout her experience. She is transformed not only through the birth of her child, but more importantly through her ability to endure. It is a fabulously empowering book for every pregnant woman to read. I recommend it to every one of my friends!"
4,Great for Speed Drills,"My 4th grade son needed to practice for math speed drills. These ""computers"" have a practice mode where they show a problem and flash possible answers. When you see the correct answer, you hit the ""enter"" button and it gives you a new problem. To go faster, you can hit the forward and back arrows to show possible answers faster. This has really improved his test scores.The only fustration is that he has gotten too fast for the speed of the computer. Even though you can push the arrow buttons to get it to the correct answer faster, this sometimes causes the computer to skip the answer before you can hit the enter button. So he hits the enter button on the wrong answer.Overall, these are cheap enough that I am not worried about him loosing them. Between two ""computers"", they cover addition, subtraction, multiplication and division up to 12. He keeps them in his backpack and practices on the bus and in the car."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I will never purchase another product from either Amazon or AUTOWAY Parts. Wrong part shipped, return was not handled properly and took two plus weeks to recieve the FedEX label to return. I am about to call AMEX to dispute this charge, because no credit has ever been issued to my card. AUTOPARTS Way claims the credit comes from Amazon, and they have no idea.I have invested several hours oftime and finally purchased one from the local Ford Dealer for less money.Go Figure,"
1,Poor Quality of Bussiness,A Big Disappointment! Do not waste your time and money ordering from this company. Irresponsible in getting returns processed correctly. Four months later I am finally getting a refund.
2,Not very well organized...,This book was not very easy to get through. It was too well organized. It is mostly outlines through the entire book. It was all I could do to finish it. Not recommended.
3,Two different Glenn Millers,"The album ""Count It All Joy"" is listed with information about Glenn Miller's recordings of the 1940s. This album should be listed with contemporary music rather than with the Glenn Miller orchestra selections. These are two different Glenn Millers."
4,Really good cd. I would recommend it to other people to buy.,"It is a nice relaxing sounding cd. She is a great artist,and I would buy her next cd."
3,"Very good on some songs, falls flat in others","The title track is amazing, and so are a couple of other fast songs. However, her voice isn't good enough for some of the slower songs, and she can't always pull them off. In general it's a decent album."
4,Snow...,Everything I had hoped of Anggun. The music was enjoyable and the cd is listened to quite often by everyone in the house... even my husband. The song the cd is named for is definitely a song to enjoy. It is more of a soothing nature and relaxing to listen to. I have no disappointments about purchasing the cd.
4,stunning heavenly voice and music...,"Beautiful voice with so many gems like ""Snow on the Sahara"" and listen to her amazing cover of David Bowie's ""Life's on Mars"".Simply an enchanting singer. Her voice reminds me of Annie Lennox, highly recommended!"
2,"Not much else past ""Snow on the Sahara""","I love the song ""Snow on the Sahara"" but after that track there isn't anything memorable. The lyrics are minimal and shallow. And the arrangement of the music distracting. I think Anggun has a potentially beautiful voice which you catch a glimpse of on the title track. But the other songs don't allow the depths of her range to be further explored. Maybe when she starts writing her own songs it will get better."
1,Sorry,I thought she's into R&B or Pop but it sounds like so ethnic. It's only good if you're meditating or you wanna be alone.
4,almost perfect,"I bought the Snow on the Sahara CD without listening to any of the tracks. I had never heard of Anggun until I read an article about her. I'm always up for trying new things, so I bought the disc. It's really incredible. Anggun has a really great alto voice, very powerful, but it lacked some expression. My guess is that she isn't fluent in English, so she may not be able to emphasize particular words. I say this because the foreign language lyrics (which I believe are in her native language) are much more impressive, The CD is filled with lots of variety, but I especially like the Asian ethnic instruments. My favorite track is ""Rose in the Wind,"" which I feel shows off her voice best."
4,Beautiful....,"Anggun has a beautiful voice...for this reason alone I bought this album. I first heard Anggun when I received a free sample tape of this album at a concert. It sat in my car for over 6 months unopened. One day driving home from work I got bored and decided to open the package. I listened to ""Snow on the Sahara"", the first song, and I was blown away by her voice. The very next day I bought the album...and I listen to it every day now. I wish I had not let her beautiful voice go to waste for 6 months. Buy it and give it to someone - they will love it. I can't imagine anyone wouldn't."
3,ANGGUN cuts through the stactic with a seductive drive,"'A Rose in the Wind' first caught my ear in a noisy humid Waikiki club crowding in on three in the AM. It stayed in my mind the rest of the day, on break time I checked out Amazon-dot-com, listened to a few snippets, chance it, ordered one copy on line... shared the CD with friends and everyone grooved on Anggun's seductive rhythmn and driving force. Solid musicianship - - nice mix - - the fix was in for a run on the Waikiki Ckub Scene. Aloha - -"
5,All in my mind,"This CD has completely inspired me. The song ""My Sensual Mind"" is simply incredible. It inspired me to write the novel Terra Quest which should come out soon. My Sensual Mind is a good dance song as well. If you don't have the CD, buy it. Trust me on this one."
5,A musical epiphany that can awaken anyone's imagination.,Her music should be categorized in a genre of its own. The ethereal lyrics and music had me spellbound. Some might call her Enya of the East.
5,A Great Album,I purchased this album without knowing what to expect. I had no idea what this was going to be. I'm not clear why I purchased it. I was very pleased with the album.Her phrasing is fantastic and this turned out to be a great surprise.It was one of those times using instinct which paid off.
4,Unsettling and rich--a darkly Irish tour-de-force.,"I hadn't heard of McGinley until I picked up this book on a discount table in Galway. It's an intriguing, powerful read, full of poetry and menace and dark humor. The ending is a little rushed and unprepared for my liking, but I suppose McGinley is sacrificing more conventional storytelling for the suddenness of myth, and I didn't object all that much to the surprising resolution.All in all, a good, engrossing novel."
2,"Beautifil graphics, horrible gameplay",Age of Sail 2 has some of the best graphics I've seen in any genre of computer games. It's too bad that the graphics are the only good thing.The gameplay is horrible. All you do is keep clicking on a ship to shoot at it until it sinks. It's virtually impossible to play when you're expected to control a whole armada.My suggestion is to spend your money on another game.
4,What AOS2 should have been,"The game looks great and it is fun to play. It is what Age of Sail 2 should have been. Most of the bugs seem to be worked out. It still has problems, but it is a lot of fun for anyone interested in the genre."
2,Pretty boring,"At first it's fun to play, but very quickly the similiar battles get boring. Good for a game to play every once in a great while, but definitly not worth the [price] they're asking for here."
3,"Cool concept, lousy execution","If fast action is your taste, look elsewhere. If historical gameplay is to your liking, this title works. However, the nut and bolts of the game are poorly implemented. The game plays like an early beta release, all of the patches help but it is still a buggy game, bottom line. Such a shame, as the graphic engine does an admirable job of rendering the ships and their surroundings. Hope the follow up game I've been reading about is tested and proven more thoroughly when it is released than this one was."
4,Great Game!,"This game has many scenarios with multiple battles and historic battles that cover the whole range of difficulty. Some are simple and some impossible, and you can change sides once you have beaten it on one side. The graphics are fantastic, although the land could have been much more detailed, but this is a sea game not a land game. The other fault is I thought that the game should have had more campaings where you could buy and service your fleet. This is the best sailing game I have played. I recomend it."
3,it was a good game but......,Good game on easy level but got harder and more frustrating. If you have the time it would be a good game.
4,Great title with alot of Play,Someone should run with this and make it a new version.. it needs a patch as it sometimes crashes... so save between missions..
2,Frustratingly buggy,"As several reviewers have noted, this game has a lot of potential. It's visually nice, has tons of scenarios and flexibility, and is probably about as authentic as such a game can be. But it doesn't work. It often fails to load games properly, the game often freezes the computer (a P4, so it's not an old computer), and various key options--like manual firing--don't always work. Further, Talon Soft tech support was useless--they merely said to get new drivers for the graphics card, which was clearly not the problem. The game says it is Win Me ready, but it's not. I keep checking for new updates to see if they fix any of this, but the .1 update out so far doesn't do a bit of good. Until it's fixed, I find the game unplayable and I feel ..."
2,Some day it will be good,"It's too bad that this was released well before it was ready, because it is plagued with bugs. Due to the lack of any real documentation I struggled with the interface. After finally resorting to searching the internet I found that I was not alone. Many of the features just don't work, while others cause the game to crash. After downloading the first (and only) patch for the game a few bugs were fixed, but there are still many more.On the upside, the game is beautiful to look at, and if you can work around the bugs (emphasis on work) it is pretty cool. I'm hoping that it'll actually be playable by summer, so I'm packing it away for now in hopes of a better future."
1,This game is a demo,"I say that this game is a demo because it is clearly was released six months before completion. The bugs and glitches are multitude. We have become used to seeing games released before they are totaly de-bugged but this (believe me) is the record. Buggs aside, the main problem is that the game has not even been completed--it is a rough sketch of a possibly great art work. Perhaps 50% of the scenarios fuction reasonably correctly (excluding the bugs). If you have Voodoo 3 don't buy this untill its Voodoo problems are sorted out (check the message boards at the Talonsoft website). In fact, if you have been eagerly awaiting this game , check out the message boards over the next few weeks (or possibly months) and wait untill a completed, functional version of this product is available. I suspect the problems may be too large to fix with four or five downloads."
2,I wanted to like it,"After reading some of the Hornblower, Lewrie, and Blothio books, I was really craving something like this. Unfortunatly the game has so many bugs and the documentation on how to play is so bad, I ended up wasting what free time I had frustrated over the whole thing.Since the documentation was so bad, once I got the game somewhat stable, I thought purchasing the strategy guide for the game would help. It didn't. The guide was so full of pictures of ships and useless data that for my $20 I only received about 6 pages of actual strategy buried in all the ""life of a sailor"" garbage. In a strategy guide I would expect a lot more strategy hints and tips. Perhaps I'll find a book on ship tactics that I can apply."
3,Buggy but has potential,"TalonSoft basically released a beta version of this title and have been working to get out patches ever since. The promise of this game is really high, so if they can get their act together, it could be quite good once finished.Not for people who like fast-paced action games; it is RTS, but remember that real-time sail combat was a game of patience and skill, not slam-bang action. Lovely graphics if you have the right hardware."
1,this movie was awful,"I lived in Berlin for several years and there are some great German comedies, but this is not one of them. The fact that it made it to an american video store led me to believe it would be pretty good, but it was horrible."
5,Music For Meditation-In-Motion,"Todd Norian's new ""Bija"" CD combines Todd's gentle keyboard melodies with a soothing background of mantra. The result is music that drew me deeply inward - perfect for the focused practice of yoga asanas, or for meditation.I found that the CD enhanced my experience of hatha yoga, and allowed me to go more fully into a practice of meditation-in-motion. The music became part of my practice, and seemed to resonate from the inside out. Because there are no abrupt changes of pace or key, the 70 minutes of music presented in this CD can accompany and support any contemplative practice.As a poet, yoga teacher and practitioner, I highly recommend this, and all Todd Norian's musical CDs."
4,lovely,"My yoga instructor uses this CD in our classes, so I bought it to use in the classes I teach. I just love it, and I don't like much that's out there for yoga. It's very nonintrusive, unlike some music that has too much singing or change in tempo between songs. As the title implies, it is soothing and is good for relaxation background music as well as yoga."
4,Came damaged,"Although this was in ""new"" packaging, it came scratched. I did not return it as time was pressed, as the home was to be rented out the day after it came. Otherwise, it was the correct fit and model as ordered."
1,Get the Logitech steering wheel instead,"I bought this steering wheel for my husband along with Grand Turismo for Christmas. We had to return it because handling was awful and it was defective. The steering is very sensitive, so it always overcomensated on turns. We were crashing CONSTANTLY! He thought that maybe it was because he needed to just give it some more time and practice, but it just didn't cut it. Also, after 2 hours or so of play, the steering wheel control key pad just stopped working.We just bought the Logitech steering wheel - Much better! It handles so much better - you can really feel the difference."
1,I hit only wall,"I bought this wheel wanting something for Gran Turismo 3, after attempting to play with it, it does not work at all. The buttons don't communicate well, and steering is almost impossible. They say you get what you pay for, but this is ridiculous. It is not worth 5 bucks."
1,Update: NASCAR 2001 Compatibility,Manufacturer does not return e-mails. I keep getting cut off on the 800 number. I sent it back!
1,Compatibility Problem with Ridge Racer 5,"I bought this to use with Ridge Racer 5 with Playstation2, but it does not work in Playstation2 analog mode. I contacted the manufacturer and they were aware of the problem, and would ship a ""fix"" in a ""couple"" of weeks.BEWARE!"
1,Not Sony Approved,"I purchased this Steering Wheel 3 days after I received my Playstation 2. The moment I pluged it in, the display lost detail. I was unable to correct this and Sony was unable to correct this. They had to send me a new Playstation 2 and I was charged for the service because it was not a Sony Approved item. Be carefull what you buy to plug in to your Playstation 2."
1,NASCAR2001 Compatibility Problem.,I can't get my V3FX to work with NASCAR2001. I have contacted the manufacturer. They can't help me for 5-10 days. It will be sent back by then.
1,interact steering wheel,I didn't like this steering wheel because it was very sensitive to the touch and in Ridge Racer 5 for PS2 when ever I touched it it would move the car around. I also use the steering wheel on Nascar 2000 which is a PS1 game and it was the same thing but it depended on which course you had to drive on.I tried a course with the regular controller and it was much better. I am returning this steering wheel.
1,Forget it!,"I got this for my PS1 and when i pluged it in it was so sensetive that it went to things without me touching any buttons. while i was driving in Driver the brakes kept coming on when i was on the gas. the steering was so unsensetive that u almost had to turn it all the way, and then it would turn hard and i would have to turn it the other way real fast and lost control most of the time. my advice, use the controller."
1,Don't buy to use with Ridge Racer 5 for PS2,"Don't buy this wheel if you want to use it with Ridge Racer 5 for PS2. The analog/digital switching, vibration and steering control adjustments work at all. What you are left with is a wheel that has the worst sensitivity control that I have ever seen. It is unusable and I have sent it back."
5,GOOD,it is great it has a good level of sensitivityand it is comfertable to use(works great on grand torismo3)
1,Don't do it,I had nothing but problems with this. The controls were acting on their own. I could not even get through the menus of GT3 without the controller exiting out to the previous screen. DO NOT GET THIS!
2,It broke after 2 months,Yeah sure the wheel was fun at first but then the pedals that plug into the back of the steering wheel started to cave in and it wouldnt fit. I had to play with it for a while and i finally got it in. After 1 month or so it wouldnt work and the cord had to be in a specific spot or it would just stop in the middle of no where. I was highly disappointed.
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I bought this at Best Buy (sale) and hooked in up to GT3. My wife and I both used to for about 30 minutes. Put it back in the box and it's now back at Best Buy. Wheel/turning is so loose and unresponsive, that it's 100% worthless."
1,Don't buy this thing.,"Have to agree with the other reviews disrespecting this product. The only reason I bought this thing was to play GT3. Unfortunately it pretty much makes the game unplayable with the imprecise steering. There are many other wheels out there that offer much better control for the same price. If I were to reconsider getting this thing, you better bet I'd keep my money and pass this one over. Stay away from this thing. Stay far away..."
1,Wish I Could Give It Zero!,"I got this as a gift for Christmas. Delerious at the prospect of finally being able to play GT3 with a racing wheel I immediately hooked it all up and was crestfallen. I don't understand how anybody could like this thing as I agree with every review below about how terribly loose and unresponsive the steering is, even after you adjust it! Needless to say, it's back in the box and sitting in my garage now."
1,Extremely wide center!,"I bought this ""piece of hardware"" and I hope that I can return it! Especially terrible for GT3 because of the wide center, if you drive a car in real life forget getting used to it! Also bad for Twisted Metal Black! If you can live with the problem above then it is a somewhat decent value."
5,Schenker again,Listen to great classic rock as Schenker continues to put on a show at lead guitar. A pleasure to sit and lisen to this entire CD non stop.
3,TROUBLE: THE LYRICS,"UFO's Force IT is another example (if we need one!) of how one should not pay attention or think about hard rock lyrics...How such a powerful band, with Schenker, Mogg, Way, Raymond and Parker can write such [poor] lyrics that does not make any sense at all, where you don't have the slightest clue about what they're talking about.As for the music, word aren't needed. It's hard rock at its marvellous best."
4,Try explaining THIS cover to your parents,"I'm not sure what's going on on the cover, but inside is some impressive rock and roll and that's what counts. Picking up where Phenomenon left off, Force It takes a big step forward toward the classic sounds of No Heavy Petting, Lights Out and Obsession with five instantly recognizable UFO classics, Let It Roll, Shoot Shoot, Out In The Street, Mother Mary and This Kids. A great album, well worth the import price, but you're on you own if you leave it where your parents can see it. I'd just as soon not think about it."
2,not what it seems,"i bought this for my grand daughter. the picture on the box depicts a train that looks heavy and sturdy. big. the actual item was much smaller than i expected. she has mostly used it by putting books under the track to make hills etc. it isn't horrible, but sure not what the box would make you think."
2,"Good for kids, or for a track testing locomotive.","The set was bought only for the locomotive by me so I could test my layouts wiring, great for that, or for a kid who wants a train set, other than that, not really much of a use."
2,Frustrating toy,"The railroad was very hard to put together because the tracks keep getting undone and the diagram for elevating the tracks was not clear. Also, unlike the Thomas the Train type of a wooden track, the design is inflexible. You need to have all your pieces in a particular order, otherwise, you won't be able to close the loop. It is also very difficult to properly position the locomotive onto the tracks (it's got 8 wheels which don't appear to be well aligned) and once you finally get it on, it derails easily. We ended up spending 2-3 times more time on getting the train back on track than actually seeing the train run."
4,Train,Train is a nice size for under the Christmas tree. It was easy to set up and works well. I purchased it for my granddaughters and they love it!
2,Falls off the tracks a lot,It has been hard to use this under the Christmas tree the past two years. The trains fall off the tracks easily and are very hard to continuously keep running.
5,Essential reading!,"I found ""Getting Science Grants"" to be a thoroughly readable, no-nonsense little book that demystifies the grant making process. Blackburn's experience both as a researcher and as one charged with the responsibility of reviewing grant applications shows through. His book provides a step-by-step approach that, if followed, should lead to a higher probability of success and avoid wasted time and frustration occasioned by poorly prepared and submitted applications. Those just entering the sometimes perilous fight for funding will find this book indispensable, and even old hands will find it provides handy reminders of all of the points we think we know by heart, but sometimes forget to apply. This little book is a ""must read"" for anyone whose professional life depends on getting funding for his or her research. You simply can't afford to ignore it."
5,"Jocha's ""energy crossroads"" review","Excellent documentary, do not watch this one in combination with ""Blue gold..."" and the ""Strange days on Planet Earth"" series because after that you will commit suicide! The documentary is very informative and shows through facts and great interviews how fast a change is needed when it comes to our energy sources. In addition, it also presents some good alternatives that clearly show that more sustainable and less polluting energy sources are available today... it is just corporations and governments that are not up to the challenge... unfortunately... not only the naked monkeys but the entire planet will go down if we do not do something fast..."
2,He Loves his Brother,"There are a few interesting antidotes in this but it was written by Holyfields Brother. I'm sure he meant well but its seemingly written as a tribute more so than an objective biography. It goes up until the time preceding his first fight with Tyson so its also outdated. Holyfield really shouldn't be fighting anymore but even though he's pushing 50 and has been through many out and out wars in the ring he continues on. I saw him being interviewed on CNN recently about how he's converting his ridiculous 54,000 square foot, 109 room, 17 bathroom mansion/estate into being as ""green"" as possible and he didn't sound very good. Even though he could still beat a lot of guys that are out there he should have hung them up a long time ago."
3,A light read lovingly told.,"This is a light read. Not a lot of depth in regards to the fights at all. The author is Holyfield's brother and as such, means that there will be a certain degree of natural bias towards the great man.I think the author needed to go a lot deeper into the struggles in the ring than he did, as the impact of the book is lessened through the lack of the fight details.Overall, it is an ok read, but I want more from a book on Holyfield."
4,Bromberg rules,"I first became aware of David Bromberg when he guested on a summer replacement series hosted by the late Bobby Darin in the early 70's. Here was this amazing musician with the unusal face and unusal voice to match. But could he play! I proceeded to see him in concert dozens of times since that day and anticipated each album release. I started my own band, named it the SOUL REVIEW after a comment of David's at the start of his first COLUMBIA RECORDS album. We played several of Bromberg's songs.Hearing this album brought all of that back to me...and then some. It made me wonder....where is David Bromberg now? David if you stumble on this review....I would love to talk with you."
4,I know I ain't good lookin....,"Retrospective is an apt title for this collection, as it is not what I would call the ""best"" of Bromberg...of course, someone out there might. Most of these songs, though, are killers: Dehlia is incredibly heartfelt and honest without smacking of nerdy technicality (as some white ""folkies"" can). Sharon is great to crank up when the wife is out... Mr. Bojangles is transformed miraculously from cliche' to poetry...But why why WHY put sappy tunes on like the annoying Mr. Blue when there is so much better Bromberg stuff out there??? I would get either one of the ""How Late'll Ya Play Till?"" disks for a more consistently blissful Bromberg experience."
2,Game for older versions of windows,Cannot even hear the sound in windows xp on this game. Might be my fault but I doubt it. Same game I used to play on Nintendo but the graphic size is limited.
2,Disappointing,"It loaded fine and ran great, both of which I was worried about, but the game itself is disappointing. Nothing you do really affects anything, and it's controls aren't terribly intuitive."
4,Very nice!,Great music that needs to be recognized. The singer's soft voice and the driving music are wonderful. Check out their website for streaming songs.
4,To soon to tell,"Well, it's really to soon to know how this will work out. I can say that the magnet seems to hold the panel firmly against the tank. I've had it in place for about a month, and that's the problem. I have an ultra efficient Weber Q320 grill, and a fresh tank, so it will be some time before the tank is low enough to register on the gauge. That would be my only issue with this unit. I wish it was a little longer, so I would know the status of the tank a little sooner. Although with this grill, I think I'll have plenty of warning. One thing I do like about this gauge, is that you do not need to pour hot water on it to get a reading like several others I've read about. All you need to do is have the tank valve in the open position."
2,it's ok,"I bought this because I simply love the song ""I Will Be Here"" by Steven Curtis Chapman. There are very few other songs that I found good. Most are only mediocre. I was disappointed."
3,Medium Satisfaction,The CD just wasn't really the type of songs I was looking for I wanted something a little less old fashion.
1,I'VE HEARD BETTER,"I LISTENED TO EVERY SOND ON THIS CD AND NONE OF THEM REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AS A GREAT SONG. I HAVE SEEN TY IN CONCERT MANY TIMES AND EVERYTIME HIS PROFORMANCE LACKS PROFESSIONALISM, OR TRUE EMOTIONS."
4,Herndon seems to be a keeper.,"This new album is really great! Herndon is at his best on ""Somewhere a Lover""."
4,Great puppy toy,"I have a three month old boxer pup who's a great chewer. This toy stands up to his abuse. It has a hard frame, so he can't destroy it. He's still too young for me to use it as a throwing toy, but I'm sure it will still be in good enough shape in a few months."
4,Exactly what I expected...,"Great toy for my dog. I love all PetStages products as they are durable, colorful, and my puppy loves them!"
5,WOW!,"One word: WOW. Rufio is an awesome band and their music is fantastic! The CD is full of awesome sounds and lyrics. I recommend this CD to everyone, punk fan or not. Rufio combines tastes of many genres into one.WOWBUY THIS CD"
5,"Great name, great People. Great Music","I just got done hanging out with these people in fresno(they played at Fresno state in a free concert) I usually like harder punk music than they play, but there musicis still great. more importantly they are just awesome people to hang out with. my friend is the drummers cousin. before they played they just wanted to kick back with us and play pool. and when they got on stage they tore it up. the concert wasnt a very big turn out, but then again the punk scene in fresno isnt exactly booming. but anyway they deserve to make it big, and I think they will. but they album, and try to see them in concert."
5,A new kind of hope,"Rufio came out my freshman year and I was blown away. Some bands sound the same, but the singer definitely has a personal twist that contributes to the nebulous punk-ish genre. Their music is very emo in terms of lyrics but fast paced and exciting. I saw them when a few years ago in Seattle and they are super nice.. They hung out with my friends for like 10 minutes after the show and I still cherish their signatures on my wall. No i'm not obsessed, no band deserves to have psychotic mindless followers, but they're without a doubt awesome. and just in case you read some of the previous comments, they are not christian-band-ish at all."
5,This CD is the Best,ok i bought this cd a while ago because a friend said they were really good and so i took their advice and bought it and its been my favorite cd ever since...Rufio is one of my favorite bands now i also have their other cd 1985. 1985 is also a good cd but this one is better in my opinion...and whoever says Rufio sucks must not have good taste in music they obviously don't know talent...
1,Hahahaha. It's really not that funny.,"Another band that sounds like New Found Glory. Great. Another band for all the annoying kids that go to my high school to like. Great. Another band to start playing shows at places like Club Krome. Great. Another band ""in the scene"" to not play places like VFW halls where the tickets are 8 bucks and parking is free. Woohoo. Go buy the new Grade album, people. I'd like to hear something original for a change."
5,I Love Rufio,"I think Rufio is a great Band with great talent, all the punk emo bands are the same, but Rufio is different.Great Music, great and beautiful lyrics!!!2 recommended!!!!!"
5,Mario Batali Measuring Bowl Set,"I love my bowl set but a little disappointed that there was no 1/3, 2/3 cup in the measurements."
5,Awesome! Love 5 Piece bowls!,"I put this on my Amazon list as I found this searching through Amazon.com. I got it, and LOVE this set! Great for baking or cooking, each cup has 2 different measuring levels in it. Persimmon color (orange) is beautiful! They are dishwasher safe and seem very durable. I'm VERY happy with this item and may order a second set. Would love to buy for Sister-in-law and Mother."
5,I love these bowls!,"I am on a diet that requires a lot of measuring. So I thought that these would help. I got them today in the mail and I used them for my dinner meal. They made measuring the food so much easier. I hated to get the regular measuring cups out. These stack so nice and look so good I may just keep them on the counter for easy access. This was exactly what I was looking for. The price was great, the shipping was fast and the ease of use is perfect. I love them."
2,Be Aware! Doesn't Match!,"Please be aware that these are a light more pastel orange. Where as the Measuring spoons are a DARK Brownish/Orange, and the Pizza cutter is a burnt orange. Check customer images for a comparison of Three Batali items."
3,Not enough increments,"If you know basic math and fractions, then three of the five of these bowls aren't necessary. However, the one fraction that is neglected is the 1/3 increment. It's much more difficult to guess at this number, and I ended up having to go buy another cheap set of measuring cups to supplement these since a lot of my recipes call for 1/3 or 2/3 of a cup of ingredients.Also, they are definitely a pain in the dishwasher, so if you do buy them, be sure to rinse them directly after use and handwash later.Otherwise, I liked them for the few purposes that they do come in handy. I like being able to look down and see if the level is correct, rather than having to set it on a countertop and look from the side like conventional measuring cups."
5,Love em,"I really love these bowls, I am glad some one told me they are not microwave safe though! I used them yesterday while prepping dinner then took two of them to the table with salsa and tomatoes in them! I have measuring cups but these bowls are my new fave! Cant wait to bake something and use them!"
4,Great bowls!,"Just another, ""do I really need this?"", ""oh I am glad I have them"" kitchen gadget. Great bowls with a double inside measure. I use them alot!"
5,Mario Products Are Beautiful,"My Grandson purchased the set of bowls for me ,something I keep on the counter at all times just so handy to have for all of my cooking.Have some pieces of Mario Cookware too which I just love."
3,Melamine - Wikipedia,"While I love the design idea behind these measuring cups, I just wikipedia'd what ""Melamine"" was (the material these are made from) and was a little stunned, causing me to write this comment.""Melamine is used combined with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a very durable thermosetting plastic""While I'm sure the risk is nominal, why do I just feel uncomfortable putting any food item in a material partially created with formaldehyde?:("
5,Softest Swaddling Blanky Ever!,"I received this swaddling blanket as a gift for my baby shower, and this is probably the best blanket I got! I received many other blankets and swaddlers, like SwaddleMe and sleep sacks, but I will be using this one for sure. My cousin has one, which she got for her shower and she said that the more she washes it, the softer it becomes. I'm not sure why one reviewer wrote that it gets ""rough the more time you wash it"" because I have physically felt my cousin's blanket and it is still very, very soft. I've only washed mine twice, but I know it will be getting much more use within the next couple weeks. My baby is about to pop!!"
3,Nice but don't wear well,"These blankets are very nice. They are the perfect size for swaddling and the weight is perfect for winter babies. However, they do not wear especially well. They are pilly and the edging while lovely is starting to fray. I think they should hold up a little better for the price, we've only had them for a few months."
4,Large flannel baby blanket,These blankets are nice and soft and large but very pricey for a piece a flannel! You can make your own double sided flannel blanket for much less! I bought 2 pieces of 1.25 yards of flannel in a very cute fabric at a local fabric store for around $7. For those that don't sew.. This is a nice blanket.. You will want blankets larger than standard receiving blankets to swaddle bigger babies !
4,Great swaddling blanket,"We started out swaddling our newborn with receiving blankets. It quickly became difficult because she could kick out of them. I think they were 30X30. I found this one online and decided to try it out. It worked so well we bought another. The only problem is that she is now 8 weeks old and began to kick out of it no matter how tightly we wrapped her. And believe me, we were expert ""swaddlers!"" I ended up pulling out the Swaddle Me (small) that we got as a shower gift. It didn't work well in the beginning, because I think she was too small (7lbs.) It works like a champ now. So, for the cost, I would recommend trying the Swaddle Me first. But this works very well and comforted her to sleep MANY times!"
5,great,Just what you need for the braun ear thermometer. Snaps on easy and discards easy. No problems with this.
1,not worth the money,"Why would i spend all this money on a recieiving blanket when for less, i can get any kind of new fangled swaddling thing that will be more secure? i don't get it."
5,5 star product!!!,"This is great for parents who are big proponents of swaddling. I hated most other baby blankets I got, because they were either too bulky (hand-knitted blankets) or too small (receiving blankets from Carters, etc). This blanket is perfect, and has enough material to swaddle the biggest of babies (mine is 10 lbs now and this blanket is plenty big). The material is really nice, and the pattern/colors hold up to many washings from vomit and poop explosions. I can find no cons for this product, except that I wish it were a little cheaper so that I could buy more. One suggestion: Buy at least two so that you can have one clean one when the other is in the laundry."
5,Must have item for the new baby,"We used one of these swaddle blankets with our first baby and now it is my go-to gift for new parents. The blanket size is ample enough to do a proper swaddle. Combined with the strategies in the Happiest Baby on the Block we were not only able to get the kiddo down to sleep at night, but she would sleep for longer stretches. It allowed us those few extra hours of sleep to regain some sanity. The blanket is durable and well made, so our kiddo can use it for many years as a nice flannel blanket.One of the hardest parts of the swaddle is learning how to do it well. It is so nice that this blanket comes with the instructions sewn on. The tag is a satiny material and sewn on flat, so there are no scratchy edges. It is a nice reminder for experienced and new swaddlers alike."
5,BEST swaddle blanket,"We have three of these blankets because they are the best swaddling blankets around! They are nice and big, and soft with great colors and designs. I'd highly recommend these blankets to anyone!!"
5,Better Than Fiction,"Once you start it is hard to put this book down. The story of Sister Margaret is a tale demonic possession, sex, and hate. At the side time the secret convent life of the 17th century is exposed. The book is an easy, entertaining read that also teaches of female religious life in early modern Europe. It is a refreshing way to approach history and the subject of women and convents."
2,Reservation Blues Review For Class Reading,"Reservation Blues was a moving and historical book that used humor along with great stories and tales told by the characters. In this story it tells about the life of Native American's life on the reservation and the frustrations and complications they went through in everyday life. Although the book start out slow with the visuals and setting up the story line it starts to unfold into a more moving and interesting story. It tells about family, struggles, alcoholism, and other things that conflict with leading happy and fulfilling lives on the reservations. These were interesting facts to learn about but after a while the story became predictable and didn't leave much to the imagination.By Sarah and Anna"
2,"Silly plot, flat characters, disappointing","I bought this book after hearing Alexie's ""Phoenix Arizona"" story read on the radio. That story was simply great and moving, but this novel was a big disappointment. The women characters were so flat, he couldn't even bother to give them real names (Chechers and Chess, Betty and Veronica!); the white characters were all pure evil; the plot, involving an all-Indian rock band inspired by Robert Johnson's guitar is very thin. (Johnson wanders in at the beginning and is forgotten nearly until the very end.) It was a quick read, at times Alexie is a very good writer (though I thought most of the dialogue was terrible), I liked learning about a different culture, and I like the two main characters, but overall I wouldn't recommend the book."
3,"Interesting, yes. Outstanding, no.","I read this book because my friend was reading it and what she reads, I normally like very much. I did like the valuable insight into the firsthand racism that the characters experience, the distressing conditions on the reservations and the true to life characters. I did not enjoy the elusive, spiritual Robt. Johnson character nor ""Big Mom"". For some reason, reading about those two made me uncomfortable and wanting to simply move forward.Also, the story unwinding into the band Coyote Springs' evolution was too far-fetched and very much less than realistic. Seriously, Johnson's ""magic"" guitar? And the sisters, Checkers and Chess suddenly spring forth as superior singers - again too unrealistic for me. Fiction it is, but a little too much fiction for me.I did not like Reservation Blues however I won't give up on Sherman Alexie. Alexie has good reviews so I will try again..."
4,A great tale of music world,"I enjoyed reading the book. The story started when Johnson Robert, a legendary blues artist which was presumed long dead, visited an indian reservation. He then transfered his talent to Thomas that became popular in blues world after. I was moved when one of the character commited suicide. The book ended happy but somewhat kinda open, that you'll end thinking what the real ending is."
4,A tale which goes way beyond the world of music!,"Robert Johnson shows up at the Spokane Indian reservation trying to outrun the devil. Now that's a premise for an inspiring novel. Five Indians unknowingly catch Johnson's fire and passion for music and the suffering which that passion brings along. This novel brings to life the vibrant and the sad sides of Indian reservation life. It weaves a tale of black magic, possession, abuse and dreams--dreams of riches, dreams of fame, dreams of pain and dreams of suffering. The songs which Coyote Springs perform in this book illustrate the fate they are destined to endure as well as the past they are destined to remember. It leaves the question: Is there any escape from fate or from your dreams; or for that matter, from your nightmares"
4,Pathos,"Took me a few pages to get into the groove of this book, but glad I persisted. Very abstract and very illogical at times, but I feel the author was just trying to get a point across in a stylistic fashion.Living near a reservation, I could see a lot of what he was trying to get to the audience, but a lot of positive aspects were totally glossed over or ignored completely.All in all, a very good book, though perhaps a shade less than his ""Flight"""
1,Forget this book--read THE LONE RANGER & TONTO,"Maybe I would have liked this book had I not read Alexie's incredibly moving ""Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven"" first. While ""Lone Ranger"" is original and real, ""Reservation Blues,"" by comparison, is full of platitudes and stereotypes. It drives its transparent and hackneyed message home hard again and again on almost every page of the book. It belittles the characters' experiences because they are so predictable--any stereotype you've ever heard or conceived of about life on an Indian reservation can be found here. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this book; on the other hand, I will not let this experience besmirch my attitude about ""Lone Ranger,"" which I consider a must-read for all literature fans."
1,trite storyline,"This is Alexie's worst text. His storyline is an adaptation of Damn Yankees. The character names are pop culture at best, i.e. Chess and Checkers, Betty and Veronica and Wally and the Beav. I was waiting for Rocky and Bullwinkle and Alvin, Simon and Theodore to show up. The story takes forever to develope and is miles behind his masterpiece ""Indian Killer""."
2,Reservation Grey,This book gives a creative insight into life on a reservation. But the plot wasn't very interesting. It was true to life in some places but not in others. The strory was boring. Hence the title.
3,Reservation Blues for comtemporary lit.,We are young Euro-american men ages 17 and we thought that this book was extreemly boaring. Except for when Junior and Victor were drunk ... This made the book semi-tolerable
4,Reservation Preservation,"Alexie has created a wonderful tapestry of humor and tragedy that allows the reader to feel emotions of every character. The characterization is excellent and the setting is perfect. If you want to feel how it is to be a Native American dealing with contemporary issues, read Reservation Blues."
5,Enjoy Reading and A Lot of Useful Info,"I like the author's writing style and his ability to tell storys. This makes this book a very enjoyable reading.This book covers a wide selection of topics that I find to be very useful. It tends to be quite heavy on varimint rifles though; this is fine with me.Some area of this book are kind of overlapping with his another (older) book called ""Modern Rifles"". If you have to choose between these two books, you may want to choose this book."
5,Fundamentals of the rifle,"My father bought this book back in '86 (the year I was born) and was the single most important book that all of my understanding of firearms is based on.- which is something I don't say lightly. The fundamentals that Carmichel covers in this book need to be known by all enthusiasts. And that's not to say the book doesn't go in depth on several topics. From time to time I do reference the book, and just for the heck of it I went to go see how the book was doing on Amazon. New for almost $200, amazing!"
5,"All the basics, well-written","It's a shame this volume is out of print. The author covers every aspect of riflery, including a couple of chapters on ballistics and the finer points of shooting technique. The book does not cover competitive rifle shooting in detail, but that was not the author's intention. Carmichael avoids the cant and folklore of some other shooting sports authors, and doesn't put his opinions forward as truth engraved in stone. As an introduction for the curious beginner looking for a good grounding, The Book of the Rifle is hard to beat."
2,"Earphone is fine, mic is not","I am stuck in a cubicle and I am trying to keep my phone call noise down, so I bought this headset. But the mic is off to the side of my cheek, and there is no adjustment for mic sensitivity, so I ended up shouting louder with the headset than I was with the normal phone. It works well enough if you are not concerned about how much your neighbors can hear...."
2,"Like the compact design, but lots of noise on line","I have been using this headset phone for over two months now. I like the design of the phone, because I do not have the space on my desk for separate phone and amplifier units. The headset is very comfortable; I use the over-the-head set up but there is also the ear-piece which provides flexibility for those who would prefer.The reason I gave this product two stars is the amount of hum on the line. It can be very annoying at times, especially when on a call with someone who speaks very quietly. I use my phone for telephone work between two and four hours per day. I would say that on at least 75% of the calls the hum is very loud in the background, but in fairness, there are some calls where I hardly notice it. Unfortunately, these are in the minority."
4,user info,This is a quality phone and I would buy another one But there are two problims I think should be corrected. [One] the base is to small and causes the the phone to wabble when dialing mainly when using the top three buttons this breaks your dialing rythem.{two} the mute button{which I like} is to close to the on/off button which can cause the call to be disconnected instead of muted.
1,This Product SUCKS!!,"I have bought TWO of these for home use and they BOTH broke within a week of using them. I highly suggest you do NOT buy this product. Terrible, terrible TERRIBLE!! The only reason it has 1 star is because you have to give it a star in order to give a review...this product gets ZERO stars!!"
3,works well for LiveOps,"I use the T10H with the H361N headset for my work with LiveOps. The first set I purchased had a loud buzz and would not disconnect properly from a call. Sent it back and the replacement has worked well. I do have interference on the line. Strangely enough, when I turn on my desk lamp the low hum disappears, when I turn off the lamp the hum comes back, go figure. The volume control could be lower as well. Using the phone for personal use the sound volume is rather loud, but on a call for LiveOps I actually have to turn the volume up so it all works out."
3,Thought I was going to have to send it back... still might,"The headset is light and comfortable. The ear piece is a little odd in my opinion and doesn't sit well on the ear. The buttons on the phone are great. The mute and on/off buttons are large enough and require enough force that there is no accidental hang ups. The stand for the headset came warped and broken. it won't sit in the holder, so I'm trying to get in touch with plantronics and see if they will send me another one. Then there is the buzzing. When I first tested the phone, there was a HORRIBLE buzzing sound whenever the phone wasn't muted. I searched all over and found that certain electronics can interfere with the microphone. So one by one I tested all the electronics in my office space and found that it does not work well with my laptop. My cell and desktop computer don't interfere, but my laptop does whenever I touch it."
3,It will do,This phone doesn't take up much space but whe you press the mute button the customers can hear the click sounds that it will make and they want to know what it is. For a at home business I would not recommend this phone.
2,Product quit working before 30 days,product quit working. purchased replacement on a local level. Not sure if it was old or faulty. Needed by a certain date and could not wait for replacement
4,Great for Customer Service,"I work from home as customer service rep and this was perfect, still had plenty of room on desk for other things"
4,T10 headset,This headset works great I would recommend it for any one working from home!! I chose the product based on the pricing!
2,customer,"Received my phone a week ago. Love everything about it,but there is no dial tone so I can only receive calls. Called tech support and after an hour of trial and error,received return instuctions. Did not get a receipt with my phone,so can't do this."
1,Terrible,I have just purchased this phone. I am an over the phone interpreter. There is a loud noise in the phone. Fact is my traditional corded land line gives me a better quality of sound. Do not buy this product. It is overpriced and you will most likely have to return it.
3,An average phone at best,"I would say that this phone is ""ok"". When I first plugged it into my wall jack I was experiencing a significant amount of static on the line. I subsequently plugged it into a different jack and the static problem went away but I find that callers sometimes have a difficult time hearing me when I speak. Overall, this phone is average, I expected a better product."
4,Great replacement,"Bought this one to replace an old plantronics headset i had. Its simple - which is what i had wanted. Ideally a cordless headset would have been better, but the plantronics CS50 i tried created too much feedback so i reverted back to this one."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Do not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible. I work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes. This set is very poor quality and not worth the money."
3,Plantronics T10 Corded Headset Phone,"The quality of sound is excellent, but the phone itself is flimsy. It shifts on the desk when pressing the keys so you need to hold it firmly with one hand while pressing the keys with the other. Also the headset holder does not stay fixed to the phone, but keeps tilting."
5,Work@Home,"Hi, I never had the chance to write a review before. I just started a work from home job and the Plantronic headset phone I ordered from Amazon.com works excellently. I can talk on the phone hands free and it works so well that I use it even when I'm not working. Here is the link if you want one.http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords;=plantronic+t10&tag;=googhydr-20&index;=aps&hvadid;=3855925911&ref;=pd_sl_72yzr16tes_b"
1,Wrong Product,"I ordered this product Plantronics T10 Corded Headset Phone (Purchased on 10/02/2008) by Plantronics from[...] through Amazon.com. It took about a week to get to me and being this is my first time using this product, I thought everything would be fine,(seeing that the invoice had the right product info.) But low and behold to my surprise when I received a T20 instead of the T10 I had ordered. I had to work with the darn thing and could not get to return it. So now I'm stuck with a product I simply didn't order. The product itself is a fine product if you want something that requires the use of electricity, but I didn't. The fact that I ordered a T10 was for the sole purpose of not having to plug yet another device into a wall jack. So I say to you my friends there is seemingly no way to know what you'll be getting under false advertisement. I've learned my lesson, and it just took my FIRST purchase...[...]"
1,Do Not Buy This Phone,"Terrible problems with radio frequency interference.I've had good luck with some other Plantronics products but the T10 is a cheap, poorly designed product."
2,crap,"there was a loud humming in this headset, so i contacted plantronics and they sent me a replacement which still had a loud humming in it. i even had my local phone company come out and test/check the lines... and everything was good on my end.still stuck with a headsent that hums"
1,huh????,"I guess I should have read the reviews a little closer. There is such a bad buzzing in this phone, you cannot hear anyone. Then I asked one of my coworkers and he had to send his back it buzzed so badly, said he tried the plantronics 12 also and it did the same thing. He sent it back too. I tried this phone because it was one of the approved phones on the company's list we're working for as did he. Now I have to try to find the phone that you can hear on....very important in customer service! THEN I have to try to send this back (since it's worthless to me). Not real happy with plantronics right now."
5,Love it!,"I need this phone for work. I love it. The headset is lighweight, and very comfortable on my head. The sound is great, as is the mic. I definitely recommend this for anyone that's on the phone a lot for work."
2,Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"As a person that reads many reviews but doesn't write review this product will be my exception. I find that this product is NOT worth the money it has the most serious buzzing noise when I make and receive calls. (I am using a magic jack plus not land line) I called my mother for a test call and she described it as ""ooooo that's a lot of static"". I need this to work my home job so I will not be returning it but I will purchase another unit other than Plantronics brand. I am going to talk through the buzz for now. Terrible."
1,Horrible Product,"The reports of a humming or buzzing noise are true. The noise can be heard in the earpiece and is also transmitted when speaking. When not speaking, mic mutes and the buzzing is not transmitted but is still heard by the user of the headset. If the mute button is depressed, the buzzing stops. However, the noise is not the type of noise generated by a faulty mic, it is simply different. You would need to hear it to understand, but hopefully you won't since you would be a fool to buy this product."
2,I can hear talk radio,Like most people I purchased this for my home office. My very first call using this headset I could hear talk radio. I thought it must have been my customer listening to the radio. However when I transferred her I could still hear the talking from it. I called Plantronics and they are replacing the product for me. I hope the next one does not do this.
5,Great Quality!,"I ordered this product to use in my home office, along with a Voip connection. The call quality is super clear, no static, no feedback. Setup was simple, and I was surprised to see that I had the alternate ear piece (in 3 different sizes) as an option, since I don't care much for the overhead pieces. It's lightweight and comfortable, when in use. I'm also loving the fact that this phone takes up minimal desktop space. In addition to all of that, the price I found here was the lowest on the net!"
2,Buyer Beware..,Sound quality was horrible.. We bought this due to Plantronics product reputation.. What a disappointment.. We read a few others reviews that stated the same thing yet took a chance.. Sometimes you just got to trust others opinions..
2,Annoying 60 cycle hum,"This issue is reported frequently on this unit.I only get the hum on my line 2 which is on a POTS line. Old headset and phones do not get this. I get it at multiple jacks, but have not yet tried plugging in to the Telco box outside the house. The hum goes away if I must the T10.Plantronics said this phone is not promised to work on a VOIP line, but on my VOIP line I do not get the hum. Plantronics offered a free replacement, shipped ahead, where I return the original at my cost. If they do this 3 times on warranty, they will offer a substitute product. Not sure it is worth it if I have to pay for shipping 3 times.One review I found from 2009 said on the 3rd try, they shipped him a ""newer"" version which fixed the problem, but presumably in 2012 I have the newer version."
1,Terrible sound quality,"I work at home, and need great sound quality. This certainly isn't the set for it!When I first plugged the system in, the static was terrible, unless I was on mute (that's not very useful, is it?) But since I was training, I thought I would hang on to it and see if it got better. Instead, it got worse. Even muting does not kill the static. Instead, I can hardly hear anything.I am returning this unit for a refund and returning to my VXI unit. I am not crazy about the VXI, due to the fact that they seem to be having a manufacturing problem (I have gone through two that just died, another person in my group has gone though three) and it really kills when you are trying to work and can't - but there is no way I could live with the horrible static on the Plantronics unit.This is a total disappointment. The unit is comfortable, the larger format on the keypad is nice, with big buttons, but the noise kills it. Back to Amazon with this one!"
1,2 Trys w/this product & both buzzed horribly,I tried two different units & the line buzzes no matter how much you adjust the tuner & volumn.I saw the reviews that said this and thought - what the heck I'll try it - well I tried twice & both were the same - really sad.If you're on mute the buzz is gone - but truthfully - how many one sided conversations do you have on the phone?Married individuals & kids need not answer that question! te he
1,buzzzzzzzz,Had a problem with the same buzzing so many others describe here. It was unbearable. I have another Plantronics headset that doesn't have this issue but it is one of H models.
5,Corded Headset,"We are very pleased with this product. We use this when at our computer, so much easier to have hands-free. We previously had a similar one but it no longer worked, this has been a very good replacement. Only thing I wish it had what our previous one had would be a window showing the phone # that was dialed. With that said I would strongly recommend this product to all."
4,Headset telephone,I purchased this phone to allow me to work at home. I am on the phone and the computer all day. The phone allows me to keep my hands free for my keyboard and mouse and was more economical than buying a cordless phone and a headset of similar quality. It is perfect for my needs.
4,very nice for working at home,"Works very well for my work at home. Nice product to have for your home office. Nice, nice, nice nice."
3,The volume control controls both the incoming and out going,"The volume control controls both the incoming and out going, so you can either make both you and the client really loud, or neither of you very loud. Sometimes my clients can't hear me but I can hear them just fine, but there's no control to increase my volume only.Also, it's pretty light weight and the buttons are a bit rubbery. I didn't like it that much, so I returned it in favor of T12."
3,Why I will never buy this product again,The hook that is suppose to hold the headsets is virtually worthless...Trying to figure out how it goes on the device is a pain in the neck...with as many of these that they sell and for what they charge...they should come up with a better design. My headsets sit on my desk surrounding the phone part because I cant get the hook to stay in place
3,ok,"This is ok...not what I expected at all. I bought the Plantronics Cordless Headset Phone CT14, and it worked much better and it is exactly what I wanted."
1,DISSATISFIED,"This headset and phone have a constant buzzing noise. I am very disappointed with the product, and feel that I wasted my money."
3,It's not too good!,"I've had problems with item, I use it for work from home. The sound quality is not always good, I can't turn the ringer off. When I unplug the phone from the jack, sometimes it takes 30 mins before I can take a call or make a call on it."
5,Great clarity and reliability,"I needed a hands-free telephone to run my business from my desktop computer. I have had this phone since August of '07 and it has never given me a problem... other than being wired. It is a little restricting when I have to reach for something beyond the cord length while on a call. I have recently upgraded to a wireless setup to overcome this limitation, but still use this phone a lot (it's hard to break a habit).In my opinion, you simply cannot beat the quality of Plantronics."
2,"Very poor, people cant hear you","Headset is ok.There is no Silent alert function, which is silly for a headset only phone setup. It has to ring to base unit.The headband is large, most women will find it too large to wear comfortablyThe mic on the headset is poor, people can barely hear you. This was tried calling several people, with different users on the headset. All produced poor call quality.The volume is a minimal adjustment. It is definately not amplified.Tone was a nice feature, but again, minor adjustment. Not like the tone settings on a radio for instance, from 1-10. But more like from 5-6Poor product, plan on returning it.The earpiece is also silly, hard plastic, so if you plan to wear on the ear, it will be unconfortable for extended wear."
2,"Great concept, terrible quality","After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to still go ahead and pick this headset up. The concept of the phone is fantastic, a small footprint and very intuitive controls. The large buttons and lights make it easy to tell when the line is active and mute is on.The big problem with this phone is line noise. After using it for a day, I have to retire this phone as it is completely unusable. The noise can be heard on both sides of the call. Also, I tried two different phone lines at two different houses, same result. Other coredless phones sound perfectly clear on the same lines."
4,Good phone!,The seller delievered the phone right on time. The telephone works as expected but the volume is a little bit low even after ajusting the volume control to the maximum level. I am sure is not a defective unit because I have 2 of these phones
4,Good for what it is.,"The headset with volume and tone control is excellent. There are features I wanted, but this was the only headset phone that wasn't cordless that was reasonably priced. There is no memory for numbers and you can't turn off the ringer. My last Plantronics headset phone also had a handset. I wish they still made that model. But this phone is good for what it does."
3,Plantronics T10 review,The phone itself is good however its lifespam is only 2yrs at best. This is the third one i have bought. I do work a lot of hours so it is used heavily. The biggest issue I have with this phone is they don't tell you the headset is NOT noise canceling. So if you want one that deadens background noise you have to buy an extra headset that does.
3,plantronics t10,I like the product its easy to use and it works great for those of us who work from home
2,Its ok,I got it for a job working from home but I find it hard to hear out of and so on but its ok I guess.
1,Horrible Product,"I bought this phone to use for my new work at home job and I cannot even hear people talking to me over the hum/buzz/roar it makes. This is a horrible product, look elsewhere before purchasing. It costs too much to be such poor quality. Very disappointed as I have trusted Plantronics products in the past."
1,broke after 1st use,"I set this up, made one call. Once I tried to make another call it won't turn back on. I've unplug and replugged in the telephone line and even tried another phone jack it's completely dead. Very very very disappointed. I'm going to contact distributor and req another...first [and only] call I was able to make really did sound good."
2,Unit has a dsitracting humming noise,"Pretty disappointed by this phone. Was excited when I found and purchased the unit as I am on the phone all day. Unfortunately the humming noise is a major distraction for me and anyone on the receiving end. Noise disappears when I click on the mute button. I have tried plugging this phone all over the house to see if other devices such as my computer, etc. were causing an interference. Problem appears to be within the phone itself. Spoke to Plantronics support and they are shipping me a new unit. We'll see if the replacement solves the problem. However not hopeful based on other reviews I have read recently."
3,Poor Volume Control,"I use this when I work from home. I can't make the volume loud enough to hear the person whom I am speaking too. It's fine when I am alone, but when the family is home and normal hum of the environment (TV on low, people talking in a normal voice, pets romping around) I just can't hear the other line.On the positive side, I like the mute feature and being to have availability of my hands to type on the computer.I haven't been able to find any other manufacturer that makes something similar."
1,Only good if you don't care what the other person is saying,"I use this phone at work. I have been looking for a replacement. The features are nice and the headset holder is nice to have, but it has one terrible flaw - the clarity is non-existent! It sounds like the person on the other end is talking through a pillow. Turning up the volume doesn't help, either, it only amplifies the fuzz. We have another, older Plantronics phone that has much better sound quality, so maybe we just got a faulty one. I wouldn't risk it, though."
1,Plantronics T-10,"I intended to replace an older Plantronics unit with this newer one. On first trial the buzz in the headset was so bad it was hard to hear the caller. I turned off the kitchen lights (brand new with dimmer) and the interference mostly went away. Due to this I had to return the unit. Plantronics makes great products, this one just didn't work for me."
1,Bad phone,"The headset went bad twice, I had to take off work to replace and still there's humming and crackles if you move your head around. BOO"
1,There is a mic issue with this unit.,There is a mic issue with this unit it has a very loud buzzing after 3 or 4 uses. I spoke with plantronics and they said that this is something you would have to send back to them and they will replace it with a newer version. It is not worth the hassle especially if you are using it for business from your home office.
1,Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Kill,"Since others have already beat the horse, i'll be brief.There is a constant buzz/hum in the line no matter where in the room I place this thing. I can manage it somewhat on my side by alternating the volume and tone dials but folks on the other end of the line very much notice the annoying buzz. No other phone in my house does this on the same line and jack so it is this unit for certain."
4,Plantronics T10 Corded Heaset Phone,"I liked this product but had to return it because I wanted something more mobile. No doubt, if you work at a desk, it's perfect. I work from home and I need mobility. Nonetheless, this is a good phone! :)"
2,buzzing noise Plantronics T10,headset is comfortable however there is a buzzing noise that only I can hear. The buzzing goes away when I place the call mute. It would be great if not for the buzzing
2,Works but could be better,"The Plantronics T10 Corded Headset Phone works but it is not the best in quality. It picks up my computer noises and often makes for a bad connection when I use it. Several times I could not properly hear what my customers were asking or requesting which caused me to have to ask in excess of three times, what was said. This is not great customer service.I am sure I will invest in a higher quality Headset phone that reduces outside noise and also gives me better methods to hear my customers when I am working.For now I must say, I use it for work but as soon as possible, I will be replacing this rather average/below average piece of equipment."
2,"I don't like it, sound too low..","It seems a little pricey for the quality..it works okay, but the volume control just doesn't seem to be loud enough..I've used plenty of other headsets that are less expensive and they are much easier to hear on..it's small and doesn't take up much space at all, but I seem to always be pushing it to my ear to hear a little better.."
1,Buzz in microphone,"Amazon quickly shipped this item to me and I was ready to rock 'n' roll -- until I plugged it in. There was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear. The buzzing noise stopped when I hit mute, so the Plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem. Amazon was very gracious about their return policy and I was quickly sent a new phone free of charge. Well, the second phone does the same thing and I'm returning it to get a refund. Maybe just my phone line? Possibly. But I've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both."
4,Great Product,"I purchased the Plantronics T10 for a home based job that required a lot of phone work. After 8 hours a day for 5 straight days, I had no issues with discomfort from the headset.The sound is great, and the person on the other side of the line had no problems with hearing or understanding me."
3,Ok....It gets the job done,"The mute button sticks, and is randomly selected, even when you are in the middle of a call. The ear piece conversion is NOT as simple as they make it seem, still have not figured out how to convert/use it. Everything else about the phone is fine, ok."
4,I like it!,"I had this product before and when I started my home business, it came in handy...especially the MUTE button (although it is a bit close to the flash button!). It has provided me with hours of relief on my neck and hand (from holding a handset). I recommend this product, although in stores it is much more expensive (if you can find it at all!). For the price, it is worth the money, however, if you want something more 'special' and more advanced, then go ahead and pay well over $100 for it. If you are a sensible person like myself, you will find that this product will be worth it!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This telephone is an absolute piece of garbage. I tried one and it had unacceptable line noise and very poor voice quality. I exchanged it for another one, and it had the same problems. I called Plantronics tech suppport, and after very long hold times got representatives who were totally clueless. I will NEVER buy a Plantronics product again. This item should be taken off the market.I should have listened to the other negative reviews and saved myself the trouble. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy this lemon."
1,plantonic t10 corded headset phone,The item sent to me did not work. I had to pay to return item and restocking charges. It took the company a while to respond to e-mail to return the item.
1,Plantronics telephone headset,"This Plantronics T10 corded phone headset is very old technology. It is bulky and takes up too much desk space.The unit I received from Amazon had very loud noise on the headset. I tried it with 3 different telephone lines, and it was bad on all of them.I don't recommend this headset. I didn't want a replacement unit,and Amazon refunded my purchase with no argument."
5,Plantronics T10 Headset,"This not an inexpensive headset. It truly is designed for a call center environment. I use it as a Customer Care Agent, for a large global electronics retailer, working out of my house. It is very comfortable and provides excellant voice quality."
2,static noise and mute button noise,"compact, doesn't take up a lot of space, doesn't require a power outlet; easy to use, good price. But the static is too loud, to reduce it to a bearable level you have to turn the volume really low. Mute button makes a ""click"" sound every time you use it. I bought this for home-based business. Every time I used the mute it made the click sound, my client heard it and thought I hung up. That is not good."
5,best bridge book,"Bid better play better is the most concise book to learn and understand the new bidding methods. Her original book was my guide to bridge playing and a teaching tool for many years. Now I use this edition as a bridge manual to bring intermediate players to the modern system. I only wish that there was a teaching manual to accompany this book.Marty Johnson, Suttons Bay Michigan"
5,to the point(s),I was looking for a book without a lot of blather. This is it. It's straight forward and simple. I can sit down and read a particular section and get the idea quickly. No cute stories or long-range examples covering 50 years. I'm happy.
1,Rotten Honey,This honey was bad. We had to throw it in the garbage because it was so bad. It actually tasted like onions. It appeared to be old and just not good at all. What a waste of money. I guess it was like we just threw 17.00 out the car window.
5,The extra in the yellow bikini!,"I was bored out of my mind until this totally hot babe did a ""walk by"" and stole the freaking show. If there was an Oscar category for extras she definitely would have easily won."
5,Hooray for true heartfelt Alt Country!,"No lame packaged Nashville ""plastic"" country here, folks.This guy is the real deal. A real songwriter with beautifullyarranged and performed songs.""Angry All The Time"" is a darn masterpiece - MUCH better thanthe remade one by Tim McGraw and Faith Hill (which, of course,went to #1, and nobody knows who Bruce Robison is, how sad).Listen to this, and remind yourself of what GOOD country is."
5,If you like Willis Alan Ramsy you'll love Bruce.,"Bruce is one of the best song writer in country music today. Wrapped is not the Formula Pretty Boy music that is being played today on 99% of so called country radio --- it's just real good Texas music. If you try it and like it, than I would also recommend his CD titled ""Long way home from anywhere"". Happy trails......."
2,not that good,"My husband saw someone wearing this type of hat last summer and said he wanted one for gardening, so I bought him this for Christmas. I'm giving it 2 stars because it isn't shaped correctly and doesn't stay on your head. It needs a string to hold it, which other hats have but this one doesn't. Even if it's a gag or costume hat, it needs to stay on."
2,Too small,"This is made for a child, no older then 12, and thats pushing it. I bought this for a costume. While it is very well made, it is not made for an adult."
1,Cheap contstruction and won't stay on,"I have seen some old Japanese movies with people working in rice paddie wearing this kind of hat so decided to get one for my mother who likes to be outside in the sun a lot. This hat turned out to be very cheaply constructed. It seems like it would fall apart with normal use. Also, the small diameter bowl or whatever you call it at the top of the hat is so small that it won't fit over your head. Perhaps that is how it is designed so cooling air can circulate, but it makes it hard to keep on even with a cloth tie strap attached to the hat to help keep it on. The description states that it is an adult hat but seems more suited to fit a child."
2,"Geared towards Law Enforcement, Not PI's","Only one chapter (chapter 13) appears to be aimed at PI's. The rest of the material is written for law enforcement officers, not criminal defense investigators. Such topics are discussed such as 'taking charge of a crime scene' (please!). And dealing with suicides (as an investigator). Somehow I doubt that a private investigator is going to be allowed to examine the scene of a suicide very often. The real world of the PI is not the TV show 'Monk' and we're not allowed to just run around under the captain's protection.Apparently since I had the kindle version a couple of weeks prior to deciding 'this book isn't really geared towards my profession' I'm now stuck with it."
5,Love Austin City Limits,This is a nice CD to purchase if you remember all of the great performances seen on ASL. We love the variety of performers on this CD and it brings back good memories of days gone past. Always a hit when played at a gathering. Blues lovers should not pass this buy and should add it to your collection.
3,Lame,"Sometimes the choice of songs by..whoever..is too much on the nostalgic side. C'mon..justpick some good tunes by these very capable artists and make an album we can enjoy. It isalmost as though this album was over-thought. Keep it simple, pick the hits!"
5,Feel it to your bones!,"Not only is this the Best of Austin City Limits, it is the best collection of blues I have heard in a long while. From Taj Mahal to Miss Lavelle White, each performer gives their all to make one feel like they are sitting in front of the stage, listening to the souful sounds being emitted. Fantastic!"
5,black crowes warpaint live,Best crowe's album in years. Has a DVD to match as well. Black Crowes are in top form with guitarist Luther Dickinson's slide guitar work is a great addition to the band.Good s%#$&t here.
4,This is a Texas blues mirror!!,"Texas is a State,full of hot deserts,but this cd shows that not only hot deserts...Texas always have hot blues with great icons of this musical style. We must reverence this contribution,specially the legendary SRV,and the great melodic voice of Delbert Mc Clinton! If you don't know what is the Texas Blues Twister,just buy this cd and........."
2,"Basic Understanding, Disappointing Strategy","This book did help me understand all of the different bets you can make at the Craps Table. However, after stating you could reduce the house odds to less than one half of one percent, the book recommends 20+ strategies without ever identifying a strategy which would help you play at the lowest possible house odds."
3,Just Craps,"This book is very simple in it's approach to the game. Which is good. It doesn't try to teach some mathematical numerical way to play the game. You read about different examples of playing the game and then cut and paste your own system. This book tell you the basics of the craps table and what the odds are, then its up to you. Good book but you should also buy a game to test your skill. Remember to bet the pass line."
5,I've read the french version of this book...,"FANTASTIC ! I'm from France and that's why i've read the french version. As a medecine student it has helped me a lot : with a very well made index and some superb graphics, this book is very clear and you can find the information you want very easily."
5,love this book!,I love to read this book at the beginning of the school year! I am happy to have another good copy of this great story. Thank you! :)
4,Evil of the Daleks Imperial Guard Dalek,"Of the four Daleks that I own - two New Paradigm, a Dalek Thay and this one - he's certainly the coolest looking of the bunch. It arrived on time amd in good shape. The only problem is that it never talked, despite new batteries. Still, it's a Dalek. EXTERMINATE!"
3,Wasko is a bit verbose,"I have to agree with another reviewer. The text can be tedious and annoying while not conveying any information. Her many references to ""which I will discuss in chapter (x)..."" is so common it becomes a joke in her writing. While the text can be informative at times her writing style tends to be annoying and pretentious. It's reminiscent of a speaker who spends all their time telling you what they are going to tell you, that they dont really have that much to say in the end."
3,Some things are just unnecessary...,"While the book is very interesting the author's constant use of phrases such as ""which I'll discuss later in chapter x"", ""which we talked about in chapter x"" was extremely distracting. She seemed to use this phrase at least once a page. Maybe she was just trying to make the book longer - who knows."
4,THE SINGULAR BLUE,"I enjoyed this book, I have always found the history of the French Blue to be fascinating, but all the curse rehetoric is just that rehetoric, I mean, yeah, it makes for a good story, but get real, I mean Louis XIV, reigned longer than any monarch in history and is the most famous monarch in the history of Europe...was he cursed?!!!..we all wish we were that cursed..and Harry Winston, one of the greatest and most successful jewelers in history, he was curesed?!! and the United States of America, the world's only superpower, the envey of the world, an economic and military powerhouse is cursed?!!!..I mean give me a break, but this book is well written and very interesting, but the Hope, cursed?...hummmm..I'd take it and maybe i could be cursed like Louis and Harry."
2,Not quite what I expected,"So I was hoping for color pages and images. A more up to date where is it now section, since it did address the diamond and the smithsonian institute. Great information but was not at all what I was looking for. Such a stunning piece of jewel and history deserved better than limited black and white photos, and drawings. Could have been much more. Should have lived up to its name. The only color photo is the cover page."
3,GROOVY,I love these things. I think the longer they are the better. There is only one thing wrong about this product. They're kind of costly. I dont have one because I am Waiting to get some more money so I can by all four at once.
5,6 STARS-Blair Witch Episode 1: Rustin Parr 1941,"First of all I'd like to say that this is by far the best adventure game since Resident Evil. If you like playing games like Resident Evil 1 or 2, You will love this game. There were points in the game were I was at the edge of my seat for almost an hour straight. When you play this game, MAKE SURE YOU TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS AND MAKE SURE ITS NIGHT TIME!!! Oh! And turn up the sound. Ive never been scared while playing a game before. NEVER!!!!!......well...until I played this game that is. Scarier than the movie. DAMN! Oh, did I mention it's very fun too. The only thing I didnt care for is the cheesey tutorial."
3,Scary but didn't need action scenes.,"Blair Witch: Rustin Parr is an excellent scarefest. As soon as I started looking for clues in the dark, my hair started to stand on it ends! The sounds and the shadows make this a must see.However, it seems like it was designed as a sequel to Nocturne. You have to go through ""zombie"" killing training and there is a ""dream"" sequence where you must kill zombies. This ruined the story for me. Blair Witch is effective when it is about what you can't see.If they would have left the ""killing"" and the graphic violence out, this would have been an effective adventure game, on the lines of Kings Quest. I give this came a B-."
5,Good!,The first person to review this could not have known how the game was because it wasn't out to buy yet. It is probably going to be a great game!
1,Not worth the shipping,"This game is ridiculous- I couldn't even finsish it. In fact, I barely started it. It's obviously just a ripoff of all the Blair Witch hype from a few years ago- a movie I love. Disappointing."
2,"Good theory, bad delivery.","The theory behind the book is a good one, I will admit. However, Hickman lacks the temperate hand of Weis in this novel, and the story dissolves into mass chaos at several points in the book.We're introduced to several characters who serve no purpose, and are whisked out of the story faster than it took to describe them. We face not one but three disasters at different intervals, and by the time the book is finished, not only do you not have a general clue as to who is where, but you are tired, and worn out by all of the action.The character developments happen fast, with very little interpersonal reaction. They bond because they have to in order to survive. Beyond that, there is nothing interpersonal about these people, and the relationships between them are distant at best.All in all, I don't think I can suggest this as a good read. More like a big disappointment."
4,Beautiful pictures,"I thought that the book had spectacular pictures of dolls, but I found the instructions on how to make the same dolls a bit lacking. It's a great idea book and inspiration book, but I would have liked more step by step instructions. There were some patterns and illustrations of how to do faces and the like, but there was a lot more reading to do than I would like in an instructional book."
4,Anatomy vs Design,"The author tackles a big problem in this book, its more than just cloth dolls. It is a history of doll making in general and doll sculpture in specific. There are web sites that do not handle the material nearly as well. I bought this book along with ""Designing the Doll."" While each book has some shortcomings the two together make a satisfying whole. in both the author is clear and specific.The author takes the reader through a brief history and then examples of several kinds of dolls from primitive effigy to complex sculptural creations that are breathtakingly beautiful. She addresses the basic construction styles of each of several kinds of dolls.This is an enjoyable thoroughly entertaining introduction to doll making in its various forms."
4,For Doll Enthusiasts,"Great reference for doll types, excellent photos and great variety! Binding was of good quality and will be great for handing down to grandkids."
5,Unique,This book is a real guide line for those who are in love with doll making. No matter pro or new beginner. You will find every detail you are looking for.
5,Inspirational!,"I first became aware of 'art dolls' via the net, and Susanna Oroyan's books via Amazon. I was fascinated by all the different approaches given in this book, and also the multitude of differing styles and results. It inspired me to design a doll of my own! It encourages you to be inventive! Many thanks Susanna."
2,Low on technique - High on Creepy,"I own many doll making books most of which are about making cloth dolls. I turn to them for technique, patterns, creative ideas and even comfort as I find the pictures endearing. But this book I returned.I returned this book because I could not find any useful (original) techniques, pleasing patterns, ideas to inspire me and the pictures gave me ""the creeps"".I attribute my reaction to the fact that many of the dolls were depicting anger, holding or wearing satanic symbols, carrying weapons, etc. If you have a sensitive spirit, like me, avoid this book. Or, put another way, there is enough violence and anger in the world - why sew it up using old techniques."
2,Would not buy because I can't look at the pictures/,"I do not buy craft books that I can't see whats inside, because its a good way to be bummed when you get the book. When I tried to look at the pictures in this book, and their other book, they were all blocked; what a bummer looked like a good book."
2,"Same sad story, different sex",Don't bother unless PTSD in women fighters is something you want to hear about. No different than what the men in similar situations have to deal with. Real sadness is that the US Military cannot clearly define a combat sutuation any longer.
5,La Roche,"The book reveals a good in depth knowledge of the thought of the late scholastics coupled with a good understanding of economics (without which the economic thought of these past thinkers would not make sense). Hence a very informative book. Perheaps the author could have liaised a bit more with the current economic thoughts. A recommended reading for those who think present economic issues comes only from the modern economic developpement. Proves also that, to discuss of the moral issues raised by economics one must have (as the late scholastics tried to attain in their time - contrary many of our todays moral thinker who despise economics) a good understanding of economic processes."
4,"More, More,More...","I think most of us were going through withdrawls when this snuck its way onto the store shelves...Candy..we found some ear candy and we took it home only to be wanting more..heck five songs?! That just wasnt right.I think this ep showed in some respects what direction Jon and Ken were going as far as writing was concerned..be it solo or later on together. ""No Consolation"" was for me the best of the lot."
3,Wake Up The Rhythm Section And Break Out The Electrics,"Yea! The Posies rock out once again !! Um, not really.This 5 song ep is mostly acoustic and more along the lines of the stunning acoustic performances Messrs. Auer and Stringfellow treated us to on their recent US tour. Oddly, the ep starts out with ""Matinee"", an ok kind of song that would fit quite nicely in the repertoire of some of those second-rate power-poppers the Posies complain about being ripped off by. Not a bad song, but not what the boys have accustomed us to. If released on a major label it could be a hit, though. ""With Those Eyes"" and their cover of The Byrds' ""Lady Friend"" are the standouts here, with ""No Consolation"" not far behind.Here's hoping for a balls-out, power pop rave up next time. Posies style."
3,"Engaging book, preachy introduction","Maria Lydig Daly seems to have had an opinion about just about anything and did not hold back from sharing them in her diary. Sometimes she's just dead wrong, other times she issues a telling observation. We need all we can get about Northern women, and this diary testifies to their diversity of voices. However, as for the introduction, what's got Jean Berlin in a snit? The introduction is preachy and sanctimonious, and that's the good part. Maybe she had better go to Tiffany's and mingle with the people she mocks."
2,over priced photo copies,This book is photocopies of old out of print boxing manuals and this book does NOT present itself as such which makes it an over priced book when Kinko's charges less for photocopies. Further investigation that is all this author does is sell over priced photo copies!!
3,Organizer,"Too small. But I will find use for it. Maybe using it in another room, instead on my desk, and buy another one."
2,Mic quality significantly degraded after a year,"I have to admit- I've never had particularly good success with plantronics' products. I'd previously had two other different plantronics headsets. After a year or so, the sound quality in the mic (the way others hear me) seems to degrade to the point of being unusable for anything but short, casual conversations. You'd think I'd have learned by now!Anyway, worked like a charm for the first 6 months. All as advertised. Then the sound quality started to deteriorate (people complained of echo & a muffled tone).I used it heavily (4+ hrs a day), and have quite a loud voice. Maybe others who used it less wouldn't have the same problem."
4,Just what she wanted !,"book was in very good condition for a 50+ year print, made a Grandmother very happy after owning a torn up copy for years."
2,Not Well Produced,"I wanted to like this video. The substance was good overall, but the presentation was poor. A few of the ""talking heads"" were not easily understood and tended to oversimplify their comments. Other times they tended to ramble on without making a point--scenes which should have been left on the cutting room floor. Also, I don't know whether it was just my copy or what, but the picture on the video screen kept bouncing around at random intervals, making for an unpleasant watching experience."
5,Welcome To,"What a great game with its city lush envierment. Well every city has at liest one mob Don and Lost Hevan has two who would love to err well just like to ahh... Kill... Each other. The sound is amazing in this game,for the guns,the cars,and your suroundings in general,church bells,ehcos,you name it. There are around 60 slick 1930's cars,all of them a site to see. The guns look great too(and sound great)use the legandary Tommy gun and,my persenal favorite the Colt 1911,along with others. Enough said THIS GAME RULES SCREW GTA"
3,Mafia is the bomb!!!,"This game is for everyone. It has awesome graphics, and a great driving system. No cheesy hit a curb and blow up, nor ram 80 miles an hour into a wall and drive away as if it never happened. The only thing that bites is no in-game save feature and no cheatcodes for it. It has a wonderful style of play, and is great. I would reccomend this to many games. Enjoy :-)The only thing is, Free Ride. I would like to see a better Free Ride mode if there is a Mafia2. Like, GTA3 and Vice City's. It was during the mission. On this, the Free Ride is pointless. Not interactive, can't do missions, pointless. Crazy Red's, you found weapons on the ground with money sign. Not as good."
3,MAFIA,"This game is beatiful in its graphics. The people look reall, the cars are detailed to the bone, and the city is well....just beatiful. The stroy line is great. From the beginning the player believes this game is gonna rock. However, the game gets boring after a while. Too much driving... no really good shooting sequences, and a really bad music. However, the end is great. This game should be played once and never played again."
5,GTA3 Take off?,"Is this game a take off of Grand Theft Auto 3? It could be, but it still will be soooo much fun. It will satsify until GTA3 comes out for the Computer sometime in April. Cant wait til mafia comes out"
2,company obviously doesn't care about customers,"I agree with the other reviews that this game looks extremely good, fun to play exciting ect., but it was supposed to be released LAST YEAR! I've been waiting for this game to come out for almost a year now, and with the last push in the release date it seems i will be waiting a year. I'm not even sure that i want this game now. I'm not sure who dropped the ball on this one, if it was talonsoft, or god games, but in any case they need to get their act together and stop promising things they can't deliever."
