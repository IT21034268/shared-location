2,Ratther Depressing,I guess its probably true to life in what folks experienced in their situation but I found it depressing. The story really drags on for way too long. Hopefully its more enlightening in the next book.
4,Land of My Heart,"The book kept me interested. It seemed my heart. It was a good, quick read. I really like the era in which it was set."
3,A Continuing Saga,"This is a low key Christian saga of a teenage girl's coming of age from Civil War Missouri to gold rush Montana. It is long drawn out tale of extreme loss, racial intolerance, personal awareness and a coming to understand God's unconditional love.While the author's writing style is not bad, she fails to gives us the true emotional sorrow or joy the situations should emote.This is a to-be-continued story, the story just ends mid-step at no logical ending point - I hate when that happens. While the writing quality is probably better than most Christian fiction, it's not up the standard that would cause me to pay for the next edition(s)."
4,Great Montana history!,"Loved the story line, even though hard and very real. Loved the accurate portrayal of Biblical teaching in real world circumstances. Most of all I appreciated the way the author expressed Dianne's falling in love with Montana .... something I've had trouble putting into words, myself."
5,2.5 hours of sheer pleasure,"I'm a new WP fan and just got this DVD. Basically, it's incredible. The sound is awesome, the camera work is very good (they actually show the band, not the audience), and the playing is great. If it's possible to wear out a DVD I may just find that out."
1,Digital quality recording of a BAD band,The only thing less fun than seeing WP live is spending money to see ...how bad they are in full video. The 5:1 dolby recording is of the highest quality. I just wished they would have used to tape to record something decent. It was fun trying to count all the Northface jackets in the crowd. Spend your money on something useful... like your own unique identity.
1,Militar Policeman in Vietnam,I found this book to be well written and all the individual stories very interesting and factual. War is Hell!
3,Not bad,I don't think the reader from Chicago understood that there was not a plot to this book. It is an oral history by many people and a decent one at that. A fine Vietnam book but I've read many better ones.
2,"Nothing's Good, Everything's Bad","Robert Rawls, who served with the 1st Cav in 1969-1970, describes his training thusly: ""Thinking back on the training, all they told us to do was kill. 'Kill! Kill!' 'What is the spirit of the bayonet?' 'TO KILL!' It was just a bummed-out trip.""You're right, Rawls. The Army's not the Boy Scouts. But that quote pretty much says it all for Santoli's book. He gathered the most disgruntled vets he could find, plus at least one poseur, to write an oral history of the Vietnam War. The problem is that not all vets view their service with the same bitterness and cynicism that Santoli's thirty-three representatives do. If you're an America-hating university professor, and you're teaching a class that touches on the war, this is the book to have your class read. If, on the other hand, you want a balanced and more well-rounded understanding of the Vietnam War, look elsewhere. A good book that comes to mind is Eric M. Bergerud's Red Thunder, Tropic Lightning."
4,Not Just Combat,"I picked this book up for the wrong reason, I thought I was going to be reading account after account of fire-fights. What I got was more human experiences that in the end I probably enjoyed more then just review of battles. Don't get me wrong, there is combat, but there is so much more to the real experiences in the every day life. You really get a feel for what the foot soldier went through. The book does read ok, you notice the different writing styles of the different authors, but the content is really the focus of the book."
5,"Excellent ""oral history"" from the Vietnam War","Much of the best literature from the Vietnam War has been its ""oral histories."" This is one of the best, ranked in the top five by 200 Vietnam vets (men and women both) interviewed for a book project. The other four? A PIECE OF MY HEART (Walker), NAM (Baker), BLOODS (Terry), and CASUALTIES (Brandon). Get them. (Comments by the author of Amazon book DREAM BABY)."
3,Good psychological advice but out of dated medical informati,"This book gives good and beneficial psychological advice. But, the medical information of this book is somewhat out-of-dated. So, if you want recent medical information about whole of kidney failure, please check the other books. Because nephrology develope so fast, year of the publication is important for your choice the books for kidney failure."
3,serves the purpose,It does the job but probably would not order again. sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. it serves the purpose when putting it some place where you do not want to have to run electric.
2,Very displeased!,"Not only could we not get this item to work on the door to our retail store. we could not get the company that sold it to us through amazon to contact us so we could return it! So, now we are stuck with a door chime that does not work! I woulc not recommend it or the seller antonline! We even tried to recontact them though Amazon, but got an auto-generated responce that we could no longer return it since we were out of our 30 days...even though the ORIGINAL email, the one they did not respond to, was not!"
3,"Very nice chime sound, but . .","Won't work on a door that swings both in and out. If the product description had mentioned this, I would have looked for another item."
3,Chime startled clients,"The idea of this door chime sounded great, and it worked properly, but the chime was much too loud and startled the clients when they walked through the door. Plus we are in an office building, so it also seemed to annoy those across the hall."
1,Lord of the Rings Cloak and Arrows,"This was by far the poorest quality costume that I have ever seen. The cape is thin and cheeply made, we didn't use it. The bow is small and made from really cheap plastic, we couldn't use it at all. The cuffs we did use, but I had to cut them and add some velcro because they were huge. The arrows are just dowels with a fabric head. I added feathers and used that end to hang out of the quiver. The quiver is small, I added some foam board to it to make it larger, then I used gold paint to paint over the design and added some gold leaves to make it all blend together. I then had to add some styrofoam to the inside of the quiver to hold the arrows, since the arrows were so short. So basically I used the costume as a base and remade everything"
4,An Excellent Beginning Book On Programming In Delphi 2,"Ever tried to learn how to program??Ever give up on trying to learn how to program before you made it to chapter 4?Even if you havent had the difficulties that I have, in my quest to be oneof the most dangerous people alive (a programmer, of any sort. 8-) )You will still enjoy, YES i said ENJOY! reading (and oh ya learning) from this great book.I think its still going to take me 21 Weeks to learn delphi completely... But.. im almost there..This book is very down to earth.. Easy to follow (no more reading the same sentance 2500 times, just to understand it)And will keep you interested, I actually stayed up until midnight, because i couldnt put the book down.. ahhahaha, besidesthat saying that i am a very sad individual... It also says that the book is very engaging...Enjoy and good luck.."
2,Frustrating!,"I got this book as part of a Delphi class I took. We spent far too much time struggling with the typos in the code examples and the code that just plain didn't work! I am very new to programming, with a bit of VB4 experience, and found this book very skimpy on the basics of Object Pascal. I wanted more exercises, at least ones that worked. I'd suggest looking elsewhere for an intro book to Delphi"
2,This book doesn't work very well for me.,"This book spends too much time on things like a ""2 day"" crash course on Object Pascal (I've been there and done that but if you haven't it is WAY too short), detailing every stinking pull down menu (so you will know they are there -- as if you will be awake enough to remember) but comparatively little discussion of the actual Delphi 2 classes and member functions that you need to program in Delphi 2. The worst part about it is it is THE only hardcopy ""manual"" that comes with Delphi 2 Desktop; all other documentation is on-line in windows help files, which suck"
1,Worhless Book,1) If you know Pascal and trying to learn Delphi --this book is almost no help !!!2) If you never programmed before --this doean't help !!!3) If you know a language for DOS --this might help to learn Pascal but NOT Delphi !!
1,Will not fit standard 996!,"Even though Amazon car selector says it fits a Porsche 996, it will not fit! SR0808N is the correct part!!"
1,dee,Came as ordered in a timely fashion will be played at my family get togethers for years to come and at other functions
5,Even better than the original!,"Now that Sophie B Hawkins has gained freedom to be on her own,Miss Hawkins is finally doing it her way!This new version of her last record for Sony sounds much more true and personal.The song Strange Thing has been changed to Walking in my Blue Jeans and now works as a female anthem. The added material gives the cd a rich,full overview of Sophie's immense talent as singer,musician,and truth-teller. This is not just a repeat of her previous Timbre. This is how Timbre was really meant to be-raw Sophie B Hawkins."
3,Mostly mediocre,"This is album is definitely a maybe.The songwriting is incredibly mediocre as is the engineering.There are some examples of brilliance.I would say about 90% of the music is mediocre, as if written in a day, and 10% is brilliant.Good voice."
4,The Essential Book of TKD,"Mr. Chun has done a marvelous job. Tae Kwon Do explains everything that a White Belt to Black Belt should know. For the beginner , it has a complete discussion and illustrations of stances, techniques, and forms. For the Black Belt, a complete review of all techniques (except the Koryo forms 1 and 2)I was hoping for an informative section on breaking but it was obvious that the iron hand techniques were too advanced for a non All Black Belt Book (1st dan up)The breakdown of the forms in short and long depictions is excellent, especially when you don't remember all of the steps in a form,or when you are first learning a form. He omits the compleat Kicho forms ( but includes them is his other two books)The self defense section however,is for the beginner only. Black belts should be able to invent better additions for self defense applications. This book is used as an ""informative bible""and review primer in my dojo. A MUST BUY."
4,"An oustanding, informative compendium of the sport.","The photos are excellent and the step by step instructions are great. I would recommend this book if you are only going to buy one book on Tae Kwon Do. Is is pricey and bulky, so some people might prefer to spend the same amount on 4 or 5 smaller books. Both of my instructors swear by this one."
3,"Disappointing, but better than Man of the House","I enjoyed the novel, particularly all of the jazz references. Liked the main characters well enough, although had trouble believing them. Loved the title and how it applies to the material -- can something be untrue, but true enough for specific purposes?The author set the bar high with his first two books, The Easy Way Out and The Object of My Affection. This is not close, but is so much better than his dismal third (Man of the House), it's a relief."
3,Good Enough,"The situations and insights are pretty real and interesting; now can we just work on the characters? Seriously, Jane was neither interesting nor likable, which kind of killed half of the narration. Desmond was more likable, but I felt like he was lacking in a lot of self-awareness, which was frustrating in and of itself. The ending seemed sort of abrupt to boot. Still, an engrossing read and again, a lot of great insight I appreciated."

5,AWESOME SABBATH COMPILATION,"THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY FAVE SABBATH COMPILATION FEATURING CLASSIC SONGS LIKE N.I.B,WAR PIGS,SNOWBLIND,IRON MAN ,NEVER SAY DIE RECORDED DURING THE OZZY YEARS.TERRIFIC ROCK MUSIC.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Get Past Lives instead,The only way to truly experience a lot of great bands like Black Sabbath and the incomperable Grateful Dead is through live albums and Past Lives is so much better than this measly compilation. At least 'Lives has Killing Yourself to Live
3,Should of called it quits in 78,"Ozzy and Sabbath redefined metal back in the early 70's and was a major influence on metal. If they quit in 78, they would probably be one of my faviorte bands. Instead they stayed around for almost twenty years, first getting dragon slayer Dio to replace Ozzy and then making forgetable albums. Then getting back with Ozzy, just so his band members can actully be back in the spotlight. They band was alright, but by the time they got back with Ozzy, Ozzy was way past his prime."
3,Don't think I missed much . . .,"when I missed out on the days of Black Sabbath's live existence (after deciding, upon Jim Morrison's death in 1971, that most popular music reeked). Black Sabbath does deserve credit as a precursor of Goth (if Goth is defined as ""depressed nihilism"" as opposed to ""angry nihilism"").Ozzy Osbourne is a competent vocalist, but too whiny.The prosodic clumsiness of Black Sabbath's lyrics is remarkable, with the stress falling (""crashing"" is more like it) again and again upon the least important words (such as ""the"").I give this collection three stars because the musicianship is competent, it would be immoral to pretend my tastes aren't as trashy as they in fact are, and some of the tunes are catchy (I'm trying to get ""Iron Man"" out of my head at this very moment)."
1,"C'mon People, Let's Get Along!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","How can this CD be any good when you have a singer, who can't sing, a guitar player who plays the same thing over and over, a big drummer who looks out of it all the time and a bass player, well, who really cares about the bass player anyways.Avoid people because this band sounds horrible. Not for those with good taste in music!!!"
5,""" FANTOZZTIC JOB! ""","I'm a 42 year old metal head and this cd brings back many smokey memories--The quality and choice of tracks are nothing but the best. I also picked one up for my 15 yr old son(who is a drummer), so he could here (WARD'S) fantastic precussion work. I saw SABBATH twice in 76, OZZY at the RITZ (for SPEAK OF THE DEVIL), and at least 10 times on his solo career! Buy this disc, and make sure our youth here it! M. G. aka Sid."
5,Great Black Sabbath Compilation,"This has to be one of the greatest Black Sabbath albums yet. Finally they have come out with remastered versions of their greatest songs. There is only one small problem though, it is missing a few good songs like Electric Funeral and Behind the Wall of Sleep. Still this is a great album and a must buy if you like Black Sabbath."
5,BEST EPISODES IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!!!!! a 13-year-old viewer,"The 6th and last DVD is the best one in the S season. Probably because the best episodes in a season are the ones in the middle (Heart Collection 4) and of course the END! The DVD is filled with drama and something new happens in each episode. For those of you who think Sailor Moon is very predictable, this DVD will prove you WRONG! One thing though, if you can read fast, stick with the subbed version. Personally, I don't have a HUGE problem with the dub, but when I heard Serena's voice I was SHOCKED!!! It's AWFUL! She sounds like she has the flu. Some things are changed in the dub which is why I don't like it as much-but Terri Hawkes was, I think, a great voice for Sailor Moon. Too bad they changed it.For the TRU ANIME fan- don't bother with the DUB!!!!AND GET THIS DVD!!!"
4,SMS the best series in the SM arc,"I give this series only 4 stars, because the japanese series it's way better. Anyways, this is the best series because it has my favorite scouts, the Outer Senshi ( I'm a fan of saturn).It wasn't as edited as the first two SM series, but it was still edited, and some of the jokes and important dialogue were changed, to produce a more friendly version for parents and kids.I know that the dvd contains a jap/english subtitles version, it still doesn't compare to the japanese version. Overall, the dvd isn't bad. Buy the dvd or the vhs that have english subtitles instead of the dub."
3,Weak Witches 5,"It's great how the S Season ends, but I wish that Telulu or Byruit or even Cyprine last more that on measley episode! Eugeal and Mimet get a whole dvd to themselves. Well anyways...if you wanna see how it all ends, get this. If you want to see Sailor Saturn, you barely see her, which SUCKS!"
4,Great Artists,"Great artists never remain the same so for all those who are touting ""overproduction"" about this album, give them a break. They tried something different from their past albums and I think it works. I am a diehard loyal fan and am actually much more pleased with this album than with Come On Now Social and Become You. I think they deviated from their original sound a little too much with the last two albums and with this one are getting back to their fierce lyrical melodies instead of the somewhat angsty alternative rock sound of Come On Now Social. I say JOB WELL DONE!"
3,all that we let in,"Boy was ""come on now social"" great, but since then, they've been snoozers. Give me ""go"" or ""gone again"" or ""faye tucker"" anytime"
5,Very satisfied with my purchase :),I am very satisfied with my purchase. The CD was in excellent condition and also arrived within a few days of my ordering. Very good service. Will definitely purchase from you again. ALSO - I love the CD.
3,Worth picking up,"This one on the whole is good and has some of the best stuff they've done in a while. Emily Saliers has some truly great songs on this, but it contains some of the dumbest lyrics ever penned by Amy Ray and considering the likes of ""Chickenman,"" ""Scooterboys"" and ""Lazyboy"" (the last one's on her solo CD) that's saying a lot. I gave Ray major points for fitting baroque in a song on the previous release, but ""I heard you were dunk and mean at the Dairy Queen,"" is just painful to the ears.Get the edition with the bonus DVD if you can find it."
3,"Indigo Girls-lite, but...","...I was thinking how none of the songs really caught my attention- Tether made me listen up- but then Cordova came on and I almost had to pull over- it's absolutely gorgeous! Amy, what a gem this song is! Rise Up is a great way to end the album. Emily seems inspired, but there's just no song that jumps up and grabs me. Some songs are like ear-candy that goes in one ear and out the other. Is Cordova alone worth the price of the entire CD? I'll say......yes."
3,Not their best effort,Love the Indigo Girls have all their albums and seen them in concert several times. While I certainly like this CD I don't beleive it's one of their best efforts. I think this is probably my least favorite. Earlier albums are much better efforts.
4,Best album in a while,This is one of my all time favorite Indigo Girls albums. Usually I just burn a few songs from each cd but this is one I actually wanted to buy because all the songs are good.
3,"Not bad, but...","In the early 80's the Indigo Girls used to play at The Dugout, a tiny burrito joint (boy, I still remember my first chimichanga!) hidden in the back of a drugstore across the street from Emory University in Atlanta. Anybody who had ears knew they were bound for stardom. There wasn't anything else like them back then. Now that they have spawned hundreds of imitators, I've wondered why I haven't liked their recent work as much. Is it because it's just so familiar to us, or is the quality really off? Well, go back and listened to the first 4 albums and you'll see that their earlier talent has faded - not gone, but certainly not as strong as it used to be. There's nothing here with the passion of ""Blood and Fire"" or the humor of ""Galileo."" I've listened to this CD several times now and nothing in it sticks in my memory. I know, you shouldn't compare an artist's current work to their former glory. It's not fair. But with all that I've been through with the Indigo Girls, how can I help it?"
2,10 out of 12 people agreed...,"Our Mystery Club reviewed THE DUTCH this month(September). 10 out of the 12 of us agreed that we don't care for the most recent Jacovich novels. We enjoyed the earlier ones better, when Milan was just a private investigator and stayed away from the pulpit. We always enjoyed the escape into the novels even though we aren't from Cleveland. The basics are still there, but Roberts is getting farther and farther away from the real Milan--in THE DUTCH, he's almost a secondary character. We all had to buy the book to read and discuss it, but most of us agreed it was not money well spent."
5,Private Investigator Hired To Delve Into The Circumstances Of An Apparent Suicide,"A young female internet executive seems to have committed suicide by jumping off a bridge at 4:00am. Her father hires private eye Milan Jacovich to clarify what really happened. The police have already classified the case as a suicide. Jacovich interviews her friends and work associates. Something doesn't ring true to him about the case. As he delves deeper he discovers an important clue. He feels in his gut that this was no suicide. He uncovers an internet snuff site that showed porno and finished with the actual murder of the prostitute actress. This was a quick moving page turner. I must say that my first thought before reading the book was who cares about a drama in Cleveland. Well, I was wrong. I thought it was a great read and look forward to reading more of the author."
5,Fabulous!!,"I highly recommend this HS-3. I am using it to combine 3 TV antennas. This unit increased signal strength 5-15% on all channels, as opposed to the standard -3.5, -7.0, -7.0 db 3 way splitter I was using before the HS-3 arrived. I will have to see how it stands up to the harsh Northeast weather, but after inspection, it would seem to do fine in my environment. I would expect the HS-2 would have the same quality if that would be your need."
1,Horrible,"I can't believe how bad this is and people actually like this. Some of the Phish songs are ok but the Who covers are really, really bad. It may be a grand joke and all in good fun but musically it's horrible in almost every way. I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this. If you want something far better try the recent and fantastic 10/31/2010."
2,Returns & Exchanges Not Easy,I ordered this panel for my front door. I haven't been able to find one locally so I took a chance of ordering online. When the panel arrived it wasn't long enough and it was way more transparent than it appeared in the picture. I contacted them about returning it. They do NOT return the shipping cost and you have to pay to have it shipped back to them which ends up costing way more than the product itself. So now I am stuck with a panel that does not work and was going to cost me more to return it than it did to buy it. I will not be buying anything from this seller again.
5,A blast and a half!,"Very well done pop-up book with a great wind-up rocket that travels through ""space"" on ""track"" pages. Great packaging, great art work, all around nicely done. As my wind-up collector husband says - ""excellent""! And the kids loved it the one time he let them play with it as well!"
3,The rising of McClurkin...,"Coming off the success of 'Speak to my Heart' is 'Thank you Jesus'. Fave tunes are the title cut, What a Love, How Long, and No Problem too Big. The audio quality is not the best, and the musicianship could have been much better. But I blame this primarily on the folks at Savoy records. They have a well-documented history of marketing low-budget, poorly recorded albums of their artists extending all the way back to those early James Cleveland records. But buy this for the outstanding singing of the choir, which was, in its day, very underrated. This was probably due to fact that it was overshadowed by the prodigious talents of their leader, Donnie McClurkin."
2,Needs more depth...,"If you look at the PHA in Philadelphia, you will find that most who receive welfare in various forms, ie. subsidized housing are working under the table."
3,"OK, but disappointed","Bought this because I wanted a fold up handle for packing. The light weight and folding handle packed into the camp kitchen very well. The folding handle is sturdy and the the small opposing handle is nice. But I could not rate this higher because the non-stick material is delicate and not very non-stick. After one weekend camping trip, there were scratches thru the non-stick coating. I will use it until the non-stick surface deteriorates, but it will be replaced by frying pan with a regular surface."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my annual camping trip and was very excited when I received it. It was nice and large, and the folding handle was a cool feature...made for easy packing. But my excitement wore off the very first time I used it. I lit up the camping stove and started cooking some scrambled eggs. It seemed fine at first, but as it heated up the middle became extremely hot and there didn't seem to be good heat distribution. I stirred the eggs using a soft silicon spatula (no metal at all), but the non-stick surface in the middle still started chipping off. So after just one quick use, the inside of the pan was already missing some coating and the bottom was also heavily scratched from sitting on the stove. I'm be throwing this pan away and looking for something else for next year's trip."
2,Not the quality I was expecting.,"Great concept; I love the folding handle.BUT, the non-stick coating bubbled and peeled after just 3 uses. I had to throw this pan away after some of the non-stick coating was ""missing"" after I cooked eggs in it. Guess we ate the missing coating?!? Hope it is not toxic."
2,its ruined already,"I used it, about 10 times, just to fry eggs or sautee vegetables. But, I tried to fry pork chops in this, and the heat and the oil and the porkchop was too much for this cheap pan. The non-stick coating melted off onto the food, and so now there are areas on the pan that have chunks of coating missing.I threw it away."
2,too thin - warps and sticks,while thin is lightweight - its too thin to cook w/ -- it warps (i have a round bottom pan now... )... and the non-stick doesn't last -- its impossible to cook anything now in this pan - even with copious amounts of butter etc everything sticks.... i have had mine for a few year - but it was toast after the 2nd use. not worth your money... especially if you cook over a flame or fire.
5,GRANDMA,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR OUR GRAND DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND (THE COOK) THEY WERE VERY PLEASE. IT WAS JUST WHAT THE WANTED
4,Can't wait to go camping...,The frypan seems truly sturdy and the fold away handle is a must. It's quite large too. I can't wait for the New England camping season -- I can smell the pancakes and bacon already!
4,Great Sleeper Disc,"When I first heard this CD, I had Holcombe's voice placed somewhere between (brace yourself) Jeff Buckley, George Michael, Michael Jackson, and Jude. That's just trying to describe his vocal style. His music is excellent although I found the production to be almost too slick to accompany his voice. Either way, if you can appreciate any of the aforementioned singers you HAVE to hear this disc. My favorite track is ""Fireflies""."
5,Wow.,I caught Holcombe at the Great American Music Hall last week...and was absolutely blown away. My CD player is happily set on REPEAT...Extravagant Gesture is just that.
5,BRILLIANT!,"He's got about four full octaves and he uses ALL of them to great advantage. His voice shimmers and flows and splashes like water. An amazing performer, he can duplicate all the vocal gymnastics live and beautifully."
2,poor manufacturing,"These brushes can be used for rough spot painting, flux applying, wood glue, even tight spot dust brush. The hairs do not pull off with gentle tug and they are cheap, as compared to Home depot.edited 9/26: Sorry about the above review. I used it for first time today. I used it as srub brush, cleaning the car. No heavy scrubbing, just pushing the soap around. The whole bristle head pushed into the metal tube, effectively making the brush into a metal straw. Gentle fluxing may work, not heavy wood gluing. The return window is also closed so this was $10 thrown in the trash can.edit Dec. 2012: I squeezed the metal jacket with dull nail puller and now they are useable. If these brushes can be found cheaper, I would be extra happy."
2,Disappointingly Coarse,"The bristles are a pretty large gauge plastic filament. There's not as good as most other glue brushes I've used, which have more of a real paint-brush-like bristle."
1,not suitable for children,"These have extremely sharp edges and come apart very easily, brushes fall out. I do not recommend them for children or adults."
4,Good but not what I expected,"I have not yet read the entire book but have enjoyed it so far. It is a nice read for meditation - short chapters that give you some solid ideas and suggestions you can spend some time with. My only disappointment was that, from the description, I thought that it would include significant exerpts from the writings of the saints. There are stories about the saints but little of their own words. That said, I would still recommend this book."
5,Great,"Saintly Solutions gives the average person a new look at becoming a saint, it's tangible. Saints are you and Iand not someone who did not experience one's every day mundane life and challenges. And the tips the bookgives on helping you understand you weaknesses and how to deal with it are worth reading, I loved it.Thank you Fr. Esper..."
1,Disappointing,"I was looking for a book about how the saints handled life's common problems, as promised by the title of the book. What I found were basically lists of saints, most of them unfamiliar to me even as a Catholic of pre-Vatican vintage. There is no information as to how the saints dealt with their issues and temptations, only information that they battled these problems. I regret spending the money for the book. Don't waste yours."
5,Fantastic! Extremely Helpful!,"This is a fantastic book! Whatever problem you are struggling with, you will find an answer and help here. And if you just enjoy reading about the Saints, you will find this book excellent for that as well.Fr. Esper takes many different common problems and then shares which Saints also struggled with these problems or sins. He shares how they overcame the problem, and what other Saints also may have had to say. He shares relevant scripture and quotes from the Saints. He then provides an extremely helpful section called ""What you might try"" that offers concrete suggestions for conquoring sin and dealing with problems in a holy manner.This is a very complete and inspiring volume. I can't recommend it highly enough - it is wonderful!"
5,Wesla's blue moon kicks butt!!!,"Yeah to everyon who's discovered thsi awesome version of Blue Moon, Wesla Whitfields a genious!!! The whole cd is great, but look out when blue moon comes on, your gonna be blown away baby..."
1,"Well folks, this cd doesn't hold the keys to my heart","I was hopeful that this cd would win my heart, but it didn't do that. I have to admit it tried very hard to win me, but I couldn't be persuaded to become a fan based on these performances. It came up a little short of what I expected.I think Weslia has a good voice, but lacks some of the intangibles that success requires. It's hard to pin point what's lacking with this cd.I wish Welia the best and hope that she will keep trying, someone is listening."
5,To me music is the only game in town...,"And this cd is the only game for me... I love this cd of beautiful romantic ballads as sung by the lovely and charming Wesla Whitfiled(the greatest singer on earth). She is backed so elegantly by pianist Mike Grinsell and his jazz combo. Wesla strays from the melodies every now and than like a true jazz singer, she is adventurous yet respectful of these tunes. Wesla is one of the great singer sof our time, and if you love jazz and romantic songs you will love this.As other reviewers point out this has the best jazz vocal ever of Blue Moon, a great cd.Can I recomend this:I sure can, please buy one today, I gaurentee you will love it."
5,Great book and a fun read,This is a fancinating book. Each year in the last 1000 years is presented in color layout that looks like the headlines of a newpaper. It is a wonderful way to enjoy history! I purchased this book for my Dad for Christmas and my husband loved it so much that now I am buying one for him
2,"Interesting, light reading","In short-history written in a creative style, but not for serious students of history (i.e. Columbus din't 'prove' the world was round, everyone already knew that)"
3,A little condescending...,"Lots of useful information, but the author is a little too experienced in marathons and distance-running to be giving advice to beginners. For example, he uses phrases like ""only one mile"" to talk about runners who, in his words, don't put much effort into their runs. Meanwhile, for me, one mile would be a huge accomplishment, as it would be for anyone who's never ran before (which is who the book purports to be for). It seemed like the author finds runs of less than 30 minutes to be pointless or easy, which of course it is for him, but for novices there should be more encouragement to run any distance that they can."
5,Nice,"Really easy to install, came really quick, will buy more soon. Truck looks impressive!! I put them on a Ford F350"
5,An impressive collection of poetry drawn from the collective works of Marilyn Chandler McEntyre,"The Light At The Edge is an impressive collection of poetry drawn from the collective works of Marilyn Chandler McEntyre. Creatively analyzing, comforting, and questioning the actualities of life, McEntyre's original and articulate poetry deftly, seemingly effortlessly, maneuvers within the intricacies of the English language to expertly craft images that linger in the reader's mind and imagination. David's Portion: Elbows planted, he lifts one/sneakered foot, then the other,/while eyes and tongue find their way/over the ancient sounds.//His not-yet-man's voice rises,/falls light, and lifts again. It softens/the guttural edges of words/ragged with centuries of sorrow.//Only a few lines a day./Only enough to drop a blessing/on these autumn afternoons.//Obedient, impatient, foot tapping/him toward the last lines,/syllable by hard-won syllable/he grows into his song."
5,Air Lift bag,"The air lift arrived on time and we had it installed and working perfectly in no time, TA-DA! I had a very satisfying experience."
2,Kodapare,"It look good on the webside, but when i got it was not what it look like.The price was good so i will take as it is."
5,Dreaming - Andre Rieu,"I have never disliked anything Andre recorded. His presentations are always fresh and unique. This dvd called Dreaming is great because he talks and explains his feelings on making music and some of the backgrounds of he and his orchestra. It makes you feel somehow like you have become a friend and he wants you to know what he thinks of the music and the people surrounding him. I have most of his dvds and although some of the musical selections are the same beloved favorites, they are always presented in a down to earth people pleasing way that delights both young and old listeners."
1,Not happy with 'Dreaming',"For anyone who is planning to purchase this Dreaming DVD, please be aware that the titles of songs listed on this website do not actually match the titles that are on the DVD. This purchase was a big disappointment!"
2,hmm.,"this cd isn't so bad for the price, but i personally only liked a few of the songs. if anything, it helped the bodies get a new fan. track 3, the bodies 'pack your bags' is an awesome song. the bodies, oi oi oi."
1,to small,"I am used that all the toddler clothing usually is smaller tan the size tells. But this one is more than a little bit to small.I bought this costume last year for my son, who was not yet 2. I bought for him size 3 to 4 years, thought it may be just a little to big. Big mistake, it happened to be really to small. According to his pediatrician my son's weight and height are very average. So, I don't really know for whom this costume is made. tea cup 4 year old?"
4,Interesting Music,I really enjoy listening to this. It is very different. Kevin has a very young sounding voice. Very pleasant. Songs are light and fun. Extremely interesting to anyone who is a Costner fan to expierence this side of him. He has said he loves music and loves to sing and this shows through in this music.
3,KEVIN COSTER (YES>>>THAT's KEVIN COSTER) SINGS!,"This is the CD of Kevin Costner's little known band. Kevin sings all of the songs and helped write some too. It's fun to listen to, although some of the songs have no point. But ""American Pie"" has no point either and IT is fun! This is just a neat CD to hear with some good, mello music. Not a classic, but definalty a conversation piece!"
2,Another star tests his musical talent,"Roving Boy's sound is a mix of light pop, country, folk and rock n' roll. Unfortunately, this is more of a curiosity piece. The songs are so mellow that they come out bland. Kevin Costner does stay on key, but his vocals aren't spectacular. Strictly for his fans."
5,Great Christmas Album,The Ventures are always fun to listen to. They have done a good job on this Christmas album.
5,Pictures Are Worth More Than Words,"If you are in any way the least interested in Zane Grey, or even if you know nothing about him except he wrote ""westerns"" then this is the book for you. In this mostly photographic biography of his father, Loren Grey has given us an almost priceless look at the life of his father. It's all there--from trips out west to the sailing of the seas in search of record breaking sharks. It's a wonderful travelog which will take you back in time to the era of the 1920's and 30's and relate to you what drove Zane Grey to be the author he was. I highly recommend this book."
5,One of the Best I've heard in a Long Time,"This is a very tight and talented group of sensitive musicians playing off of each other in the best of ways. I found it as I've been a fan of David Newman since his many great recordings of the 70s. This recording is also strikingly well done in terms of its audio fidelity. The gorgeous tonal richness of each of the instruments is captured and balanced beautifully with the others. In particular, the interplay and the timbre of the bass with the drums makes the pieces jump. It's been a long time since I've heard music this good. It's so good that it is making me notice and feel bad about the deficiencies of my various playback systems and speakers. It takes me back to the days when an investment in audiophile-quality equipment was justified. If you still have a good quality amplifier and speakers with excellent mid-range response, this record will take you back to the days when musicians could really play and no computers were involved."
1,Extremely basic. Best for young kids.,"I was looking for a reference book with names, makers, pictures, etc. This book is very basic and appears to be aimed toward a young reader."
3,good historical research to help counter Hollywood,"A small, well-written book that is an easy read giving basic but not always well-known facts of the early ""cowboy era"". A good addition to a library on early American history."
3,"Not outstanding, but you have no choice","I bought this book for looking for more information of Tornado ADV, especially in picture and drawing. But this is its short. Few picture, only 4 pages color pictures, the rest are BW pictures, and no drawing. But character is plenty. It introduces all Tornado variation, for example, IDS, ADV, ECR and some upgrade project, and attach a production list of Tornado. You can find serial number, own nation, deliver date, own squadron, and so on information of per Tornado. Although it is not an outstanding book, but there is not a complete book of Tornado in market. So if you like Tornado, and want to get information about her, you have no choice."
2,Speed bag replacement bladder,"The bladder was mailed and I received it very fast. The price was right but, the bag does not hold air long. It has a very slow leak and I need to add air every two days. When I pulled the bladder out of the envelope I noticed that where it was folded the coating was peeling off. If it did not leak air I could have rated it higher. If it's possible to get an exchange it would be appreciated."
3,Not What I Ordered and Payed For!!!,The picture does not match the product. The one I got was not the same color or size and it looked like it was used not new not happy with this!!!!
1,Option: Repair rather than replace,"My Everlast 4210 speed bag wouldn't hold air, and I found this bladder while looking for a replacement. Then, it occurred to me, a bladder is just like an inner tube! So I removed the old one, found the leak by holding the old bladder under water, and looking for bubbles. It was a very small hole. I used a small piece of black electrician's tape and E-6000 glue, let it dry over night, and Voila! I have a good bladder and a good speedbag again. Give it a try. Good luck!"
3,Not bad not great,The costume was for my 10 year old daughter. It comes as a one piece jumpsuit on the bottom with boots attached. My daughter cried because it was so tight and creeped up. very uncomfortable. The other pieces were pretty neat and you have to buy your own sword. You are better off wearing black leggins and then the rest of it overtop. Or I suggest getting a bigger size.
4,Good Book,"I think at times, this book tends to over-state things and sometimes the means are unclear. In the 4th Edition, there are examples to illustrate means, which helps with understandings.If you've read any of Julia T. Wood's other communication books, one thing that always sticks out on your head is how she talks about Robbie. She doesn't just say her husband. (This led to a long talk in my interpersonal communication class.)I think, and by no fault of Wood's, that universities focus on her books, and the students don't get a broader view of communication."
5,billy grahm music homecoming vol.2,just as described.if you are a gaither fan you must have this video for your collection. i was very blessed by this.
4,A Great 19th Century Travelogue,"Written by the wife of English naturalist Henry Forbes, this book is a highly enjoyable account of a woman's travels to Indonesia where she joins her husband to travel via Ambon, Banda and other remote islands of the southern Moluccas to the Tanimbar Islands, whose people were still hunting heads at the time. It must be among the earliest descriptions of the latter, and contains a wealth of information.After Maluku the couple travel on to Portuguese (now East) Timor."
5,Surprised by the taste.,"I'm not a big fan of flatbread but I have been on a diet and decided to give this a try. I have to say, wow. I've been topping them and using it as a snack in place of lunch. The other guy that works in my office, who isn't dieting, tried them and was impressed by the taste but I finally had to tell him to back off. He started ripping through them so I think that pretty much explains how well the product tastes. The flavor can support itself as a standalone snack but again, I top them and just love it."
2,need right discs,"You guys sent me the cd case but when I opened the cd, it had the Las Vegas show. I ordered another one and it happened again if you could send me the Omni show I will be happy to rate it. I am not very happy with the problem I have had trying to get the right cd, or the one that I ordered. Could you please send me the right Discs I already have the cover. If you look at my records you will see I have ordered two Atlanta Phish shows and both of them have been the right case but when I opened the cd case it was the Las Vegas show. Please Please help me out with this problem, I really want the Omni show so please send it."
2,No bulk order freight,"This vendor did not provide accumilation of orders, therefore I paid 10 times the freight for a very light weight item."
1,Disappointed,"I heard such good things about this book and was very eager to read it. However, my excitement evaporated with every turn of the page. While the author seems to have a thorough knowledge of the lore involved, and an above-average grasp of the academic perspective, it did little to outweigh the ongoing conjecture. The book is rather one-sided in presentation of the mysterious topic of seid and much of it is just opinion without any real supporting basis.I can appreciate the author's attempt to illuminate, but for individuals who are looking to immerse themselves in seid as it is shown in the sagas and Edda, this book misses the mark. The author would be better to omit the `seid' from the title and text and simply present it as a treatise on her own speculative soothsaying practices based loosely on the Völuspá."
1,Not worth the effort,"I found the book definitely not scholarly, the grammar was horrible and totally drowned any sense of direction of the work. The tangents taken completely destroyed the thought they started from. There was use of terms totally unfamiliar with no explanation of where they came from, plus a few she admitted making up to fit her understanding of something. I give her kudos for attempting this work. However, alot of what she ""interprets"" as the meaning of the Voluspa is Theosophic/Neo-Pagan in origin. To truly understand the meaning of such old works as Voluspa one would have to live in the time it was conceived and have that world-view and the life experience of those people. Would I recommend this book to anyone interested in Norse lore or practices? Absolutely not."
2,"I wouldn't call it ""scholarly""","I was disappointed by this book. I wish Yngona had just stuck to translating the Voluspa rather than injecting her bizarre interpretations into it. Although the translation seems nicely poetic, the original norse is not included and cannot be checked for accuracy. Apparently, she spends more time ""actively monitoring ley lines"", ""assisting local Guardians with energy clean-up"" and ""reconnecting in a non-invasive manner with primal and ancestral energies"" while communing with her ""folk-soul"" than she does performing scholarly research. This is definitely not a scholarly work as the first reviewer states, but is a new-agey, somewhat racist, poorly referenced work that left me wondering how anyone could possibly have mistaken this as a work of significant scholarship."
2,More Isn't Necessarily Better,"I've enjoyed the Windham Hill Celtic Christmas recordings for years, so I had high hopes for this one from Narada, particularly since Altan and Boys of the Lough are featured on it. The first thing I noticed is that the quality of the sound on this recording is just awful on just about every track. I have no idea whether I received a defective copy or if the overall production values on the CD are inferior, but the sound quality is unsatisfactory by any standard. Secondly, the songs themselves are just not up to the quality of others of this genre----rather a B list of Celtic holiday recordings. If you're buying your first Celtic holiday CD, start with the Windham Hill recordings, or the Chieftains' The Bells of Dublin."
5,Truly Celtic Christmas,"If you want to listen to Christmas Celtic style, this is it. We have purchased a couple of other ""celtic"" Christmas albums in the past, but all they consisted of was traditional Christmas tunes played on the bagpipes. This album has a great mix of music with some traditional Christmas songs as well as some orignals by the various artists. The music styles range all over the celtic genre from Altan to Kathy Mattea."
1,title is misleading,"The title of this book is misleading.When you read title...Visualizing Boccaccio.. you expect some pictures and are very disappointed when you see couple black and white illustrations and paid 70 $.I returned book to seller ""Hudson book store"" and never got refund."
5,5* Movie With An Ethical Message on HMO's.,"Excellent Film! Told the sad truth about corporate greed, exploitation of US Managed Care, HMO system for corporate profit. Unethical deneial of critical medical services to patients. Highly recommend this film. Laura Dern deserves ***** for this movie. Showtime and Pamouunt Network Television deserve ***** for making this film."
1,Till death do us Part,"No Stars//////Bad airing out of the family issues and problems.The book was suppose to be targeted towards the MLM crowd, as a motivational tool,(WRONG). Book becomes more depressing than motivational the longer you read it. The author seems to want to air out personal vendettas against her former husband. Bad way to make a living off of your personal failures in a book.Just because author had multipal failed marriages is no reason to want to crusade to take the TILL DEATH DO US PART out of the marriage vows!"
3,Decent,"Overall not bad, just not quite what I expected. I was hoping to see a younger, naughtier Veronika. This DVD is on the 'mild' side, and I know that she is capable of much more than that."
5,hardcore at its best,"The Randumbs are a throw back tho the fast paced in your face bands of old punk rock. The ten new tracks on this cd are great songs that should keep the punks living it up in the pit. so if your a fan of punk you have to buy this cd, because they are one of the best bands out right now."
5,RANDUMBS ROCK!,"A mix of oldschool and street punk the Randumbs are drunk alcohol loving partyboys. Their lyrics are demented and lowbrow , the guitars shred , the drums pound , and the vocal's make your own throat sore. Best tracks ""I Hate You"" and ""I Need A Beer"""
2,Acu-rite not really accurate,"This model appears to be the closest to the one I have, which also includes indoor/outdoor humidity readings.The thermometer, both indoor and outdoor, consistently reads at least one degree higher than my three other thermostats, which all agree with each other. Sometimes the Acu-rite is higher by three degrees. Customer service says it meets the ""industrial standard"" of plus/minus two degrees, and can not be calibrated.The humidity reading is about 30 percent off from local TV and weatherstation readings.On the plus side, it does have a longer distance range than the other wireless thermometer I have."
4,Another stellar effort from Dolly Varden!,"Steve Dawson and friends never fail to entertain you, and this is one of their best yet!Get it!D"
4,Solid independent documentary style comedy,"With the digital revolution today, any idiot with a desktop computer and a camcorder can make a movie. This is what Ravi Godse, the character, writer, and director of the independent comedy movie DVD Dr. Ravi & Mr. Hyde is told early on in the movie by one of his friends. The friend is right; Ravi is an idiot -his wife will vouch for it-- but he is not just any idiot, he is a very special, determined idiot. Dr. Ravi And Mr. Hyde may not have the production values and acting skills of a Hollywood blockbuster comedy nor the smaller budget and lesser acting skills of most independent movies but it is better than many, many other independent films I have seen.Dr. Ravi Godse has a midlife crisis and decides to make a movie. It is what Godse does with the premise, himself as a character, and the real life characters around him that make this independent comedy work."
4,Dr. Ravi demontrates you can have a mid-life crisis while pursuing your dream,"I liked Dr. Ravi & Mr. Hyde and recommend it highly. It is a good-natured comedy filled with medical, situational and pop culture humor in which Godse plays himself as a witty physician who pursues a single-minded dream of making ""a timeless, classic"" movie.On a personal note, I believe the mark of a good movie, regardless whether it is a Hollywood blockbuster or an Independent film, is whether you wind up thinking about it afterward. For days I thought about some of the scenes and funny lines contained in Ravi. What impressed me is how filmmaker Dr. Ravi Godse, who loves word plays, delivered jokes to make deeper points that reveal insights into a physician's psyche. After all, doctors are people, too! But the thing I most will take away what filmmaker Dr. Ravi Godse created is how honest the movie came across.Well done!"
1,Independent At Its Worse,"Even with being independent, this film was still just a display of bad acting and no plot within site. I highly recommend to stay away from this film."
3,A Childish Romp,"I found this novel to be a little disappointing. Annette's childish scheming to cure the afflictions of handsome and powerful Josh Lord seemed almost too good to be true. Why such an eligible man would tolerate the machinations of such a girl is a little difficult to discern. I've read other works by the author, but this one was clearly not her best."
5,great product,Love the way it takes the frizz from my hair without weighing it down. A little bit goes a long way!
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed. The title says ""Tales From the Cubs Dugout"" and yet its obvious that the author didn't bother talking with any of the players. Where were the accounts in Ernie Banks' own words? Or Billy Williams? Or Ron Santo's? Or Andy Pafko's? Or Mark Grace? These players are all very accessible and are more than willing to talk about their days in a Cubs uniform.Instead, the author has chosen to re-tell stories that have been told over and over again. And even that's being generous as most of the tales aren't even tales - but rather more like summaries from old Cubs media guides.If this book had a different title - such as ""Cubs Facts"" or ""The Players"", etc., I would not have been as disappointed - that's why I give it two stars and not one. But when I see ""Tales"" in the title, I expect to read at least some narrative from the players themselves."
5,NICE AND EASY,"THIS IS A BUNCH OF SHORT FACTS AND STORIES PUT TOGETHER ABOUT MANY FORMER CUB PLAYERS. SOME ARE RHINO, BANKS, GRACE AND SOSA. EACH PLAYER HAS 2-5 PAGES DEDICATED TO THEM ALONG WITH A SKETCH OF THEM. THIS IS EASY AND BREEZY READING AND VERY ENJOYABLE. I RECOMMEND IT FOR A RAINY AFTERNOON OR COLD WINTER DAY TO MAKE THE DAY ENJOYABLE. THIS IS A VERY ENTERTAINING BOOK. FOR ALL CUB FANS."
5,Great product!,"DeLonghi Stiromeglio Compact PRO 300 Ironing System with Pressurized Boiler is a wonderful product! You can put the water in the boiler and go on ironing for hours without having to think about refilling. The powerful pressure system allows you to have perfectly ironed items with very little effort! I am very satisfied with the purchase.Also, the item was delivered very quickly and the package showed no damage.I definitely recommend this product and this seller!"
4,Great Iron,Great iron. Just needs to read the instruction and use it properly. It is a quick way to professional iron and saves money by not using cleaners (too many chemicals). It can be ackward on large items but for clothes is easy.
1,Dangerous Iron,"DO NOT purchase this iron, spend the extra money and purchase the Reliable Ironmaven. This is a poor product. I have owned this iron for a year and it will always spit when left to sit for more then 5 minutes when using the steam button, you must press the steam button over towel before you use it or else you will get a puddle. It is a very heavy iron and it will slip off the stand, mine has slipped then melted the front steam button. The lip that holds the stand is not high enough to hold the iron and is built on an angle, poor engineering. This is where the danger slips in, if not place perfectly on the stand it will slip off as mine has several times. The warranty will not cover any replacement for the buttons. The steaming is not very robust, I test drove a Iron Maven yesterday and shot steam about 8ft the Delonghi will do about 2ft, if you are lucky."
3,Try Again,We read the reviews of the DeLonghi Stiromeglio Compact PRO 300 Ironing System with Pressurized Boiler - and noted that they were mainly positive- after many years of buying and being frustrated with Rowenta irons- we decided to upgrade to the DeLonghi. The iron and steam system work extremely well and deliver on high quality ironing. But we are returning it because in under one month the steam button/switch that activates the steaming is broken! We're trying again with a replacement and hope that the button/switch failure was a fluke- but to have such a good system with such a cheap button/switch is not just a design problem but business philosophy one as well- saving a couple of cents on a fundamental operating part invites problems.
3,A little disappointed,"After having it a few weeks, I am not as impressed as I hoped to be. I have already ordered another iron. It leaves all of my clothes feeling really damp so you can't iron anything and jump right into it to wear. I am a seamtress and the dampness makes it impossible to use this iron when I am sewing. I ordered this model to replace my old Europro model which I really miss, and I don't think I am ever going to find another iron like that model. Now, maybe between the two irons I will come close to what I was use to. I will keep this one, but if I could have used it before actually purchasing--I would not have purchased it."
3,if it keeps working it is great to use...mine didn't,"Had my Stiromeglio for about 5 months and steam started escaping around the iron base. Burns me now when I try to use it.Not very well made obviously, and when I received it I was a bit concerned because the exterior is all molded plastic.I really enjoyed it for five months....now not so much"
5,DeLonghi Stiromeglio Compact PRO 300 Ironing System with Pressurized Boiler,"Best iron I've ever used. Same results as professional laundry. We send most clothes out, but have to iron some. Super fast - Almost makes ironing a pleasure. Much better than Rowenta. Read all of the reviews before I purchased. Unfortunately, quit working after two years. Was replaced under the 3-year warranty without charge. Would recommend to anyone."
3,Doesn't beat the Rowenta,"The DeLonghi Steromeglio is a replacement for a Rowenta steam generating iron that lasted three years and two weeks. The DeLonghi takes much longer to create steam at heat up time and for some reason that I can't identify, doesn't seem to iron quite as quickly or smoothly. It certainly gets hot enough. Both are great for wet table linens, which I iron the old fashioned way.Ruth"
3,A spitter,"Our first boiler type steam iron (EuroPro) finally stopped after 14 years of use. I bought this one as a reasonably priced replacement. I use reverse osmosis water in it even though they say you can use tap water. After the first 2 months of use is has begun to spit water pretty much all the time. I called the authorized Delonghi service shop here and as he put it ""Delonghi is overpriced crap"". I am not sure that I agree as it does a great job other than the spitting and the inconvenience of not knowing it is full until it overflows. Our other iron had a clear plastic tube with a marking on it so you could check the level.I have a Reliable ironing table with the heated table and blower. I am very impressed with the quality. I am thinking I will return the iron to Sears as it is still within the 90 day return window and pay for an upgrade to the Reliable."
5,Love it!,"DeLonghi Stiromeglio Compact PRO 300 Ironing System with Pressurized BoilerJust got my iron and it is marvelous! It's true, you really can iron faster because the steam passes through to the other side. Did a pillow case in 30 seconds. What's the record? With a little practice. Get the Rowenta ironing board to go with itRowenta IB-6200 Professional Ironing Board. It has the right support for the iron boiler and it's nice and wide. You won't be sorry. My wife even likes the system.Henpecked"
4,Problem with water release,"I'm a home sewer so require a reliable, safe iron. This one filled the bill until recently. All of a sudden, it drips (a lot) water onto my material or ironing board cover. I have tried releasing steam at the outset as advised, but to no avail. I'm not sure how to handle this problem. Otherwise, the iron is fantastic. I haven't had it all that long, so don't want to have to replace it. If anyone knows of a solution, I sure would appreciate it. I purchased it from Amazon, and for more than it currently sells for, but that was okay with me as long as it works good. I prefer this iron to others I have purchased."
1,IRON SUCKS,"I had mine under a year...didn't get anything back from them in over 2 months...NEVER BUY FROM THEM THEY ARE CROOKED, THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.I give them a 0 but they don't have one."
2,Needs improvement,"In buying this, it was my intention to upgrade from the Rowenta. Although its build quality is better than the Rowenta I still prefer the Rowenta. I returned it for a refund. The water tank is too small and the iron surface could use more holes for steam output. Because the iron surface on the Rowenta has more holes for steam I can iron much faster"
2,Difficult to fit onto ironing board,"The reviews for this iron are all great, however none of them mention the fact that this iron is difficult to fit onto the ironing board because the boiler base is so big and clunky. I'm sure it does all the things that the other reviewers said it does, but when you want to ""iron and go"" in the morning this iron is not the one for you. I am returning this iron because it is impractical for modern day use. In order to allow the iron to cool down you have to unplug the power cable and leave it where it is because the base is so heavy and the iron plate is hot; therefore you cannot put it away until you return home from work. This is not a working woman's iron."
4,Love ti!,"I use this iron every day, for many hours. I make custom draperies in my home studio.I bought this iron to replace a Reliable that had died after only one year (of course just past it's warranty!)The steaming is consistent. No spitting of water.The hand unit is heavy enough to press the fabric, but not so heavy to cause hand fatigue. I like that I can use either hand, fingers underneath the handle, or my thumb above the handle. And lock the steam button for continuous use.The only complaint I have is that the steam hose is not very long, about four and a half feet. Not quite long enough to reach all the way across my five foot wide table.Other than that, I love this new iron!"
2,Poor Life Span,"Two major problems:The rubber seal that comes with system split the fourth time I used it. I took the seal to the local hardware store and bought three replacements for $1.00 and almost a year later, the first onestill feels like new.The rubber tube inside the iron that connects from the hose to the iron steam tank died after 18 months and I replaced it with an automotive high temp silicone tube. That died after six months - am now on my third tube. Replacing these tubes is a real PITA, not recommended for anyone short of a 9 on a 10 scale ability to repair electrical appliances. I have all of the tools and it still is difficult.DeLonghi/Fox International does not carry parts for this iron, so you are stuck.One functional design I don't like is the inability to see how full the tank is. You have to be careful filling with the funnel, slowing down the flow until you can see the water. Otherwise, over the top it comes!"
5,Great!,"I have been buying regular steam irons for years, trying to find the right one. Buying too many irons. None of them ever worked well. The last iron I bought was a mini travel steam iron to get inbetween small areas. So I would iron with my regular iron and then take out the mini iron. I liked the mini iron alot but it couldn't cover the whole area of clothes quickly enough.I just spent an hour ironing with this new DeLonghi steam iron and loving every minute of it. I kept looking for clothes to iron. I didn't want to stop! It takes only one pass to iron heavy cotton broadcloth shirts! Wrinkled clothes stand no chance of staying wrinkled. Everything looks like I used starch on them. This is fun!"
5,DeLonghi Stiromeglio Compact Pro 300 Ironing System with Pressurized Boiler,"I have a friend who has a DeLonghi steam iron, and I too wanted one. I could not purchase one in Australia with the cork handle, which was made in Italy. Australia only sold those that are made in China, they don't make them with cork handle. I was excited when I saw you had this particular iron, only too be disappointed when I discovered the voltage was not compatible. I was unaware of this, I suggest you should advise customer's of the irons voltage and where this voltage is compatible. However, Amazon came good with the return of the product and shipping costs. You are awesome Amazon."
2,Not on par with Rowenta,I bought this iron a year ago when the price was higher.I thought the design would be better that the newer Rowenta since neither had a remove-able tank. This one just stopped working after just under on year.We had a rowenta for 6 years without a days trouble - only replaced it because the the steam hose was fraying.disappointing
3,"Good, but maybe overkill","This ironing system is good, but I rarely need this much steam. Often, will use our regular old handheld unit to do a single item rather than wait for this bad boy to heat up.Pros:-LOTS of very hot steam-Pretty fast steam ironingCons:-Takes FOREVER to warm up the boiler - like 15-20 minutes at least-Insides get oxidized after about 1 year, very hard to clean (vinegar doesn't do the trick)If you need to iron very large items that require more steam than a regular iron can make (curtains, king size sheet sets), this is for you. But if you're just ironing shirts, pants, and dresses, save some time and money with a $20 iron that heats up in 1 minute."
3,Spitting!,"I've had this iron for about two months, and have used it regularly, but not daily, for ironing shirts and a few sewing projects. Up until now, it has been great, producing lots of steam.However, just in the last week, it has begun spitting water droplets and making much less steam! I've only ever put distilled water in it. The spitting is making it difficult to use.Does anyone have any ideas what the problem could be or how to fix it?"
5,Love this iron!,"I'm a quilter and have always had problems with Rowenta, Shark, etc. spitting after a short while. Read all the reviews here on the DeLonghi and decided to try it. Why not? It comes with a 3 year warranty!I just got this steam iron. So far I'm loving it!The only complaint I would have is that the steam cord could be a bit longer."
5,good iron,"purchased this iron to replace a Reliable with a cracked pressure tank. The Reliable cost about three times as much and this iron is its equal, if not its superior. I sew a lot and need the pressure steam. The only problem I had was the instructions did not say how much water to fill. I e-mailed the company and they responded right away. It takes slightly less than one liter. So far I have been extremely happy with the iron. It takes a few minutes to get up to steam, but have had no problems with spitting or dribbling. All in all I would purchase another one without hesitation."
3,Design flaws,"I like this iron, but beware:1) I scorched the dining room table, even though I put the iron base unit on a thick towel.2) I thought I had turned it off, since I pressed both on/off buttons for steam and heat and they never lit up, but it was on and stayed on for several hours until I smelled the hot iron and unplugged it.3) There is no water level indicator. So you have to pour the water in until it overflows. And you don't know when you're going to run out, which is inconvenient, since you have to wait until the iron cools down before adding more water."
1,I call it De-Shorty,"The product should be called ""De-Shorty"" instead of Delonghi since none of their products seem to last more than a few months or at best a year. The Iron has so many design flaws that it is not worth the $172.00 it cost. It has no water level, the hose is too short and spits hot water, there is no way of knowing if it is on or off, and it doesn't last very long. The Delonghi electric cheese grater lasted only one month and the coffee maker less than 6 weeks. I will never buy another Delonghi."
1,Worked great for about 5 months. Now it just spirts out water and does not heat up.,It has a really weak cord that the electricity and steam flow through. It is not connected well and eventually fell apart. It did work great for about 5 months. Time to figure out how I can get this fixed. Hopefully it will not have to become landfill.
5,Massage Gel,"I'm a massage therapy student so I've been doing a lot of experimenting with different gels, lotions, and oils over the past year. This has been one of my favorite to use. It doesn't dry out too quickly and it doesn't feel like it over-lubricates. Good stuff."
2,Absorbs too fast and have to use too much,I was amazed at how quickly I went through the 8oz bottle. I had to use so much of this lotion on each client because it absorbs so quickly. I will never buy this again.
5,"Very Versitile, This Is My Favorite Massage Lotion.","This is my favorite massage lotion. The scent is very faint; I don't care for perfumed lotion. I have had many people with various skin allergies and none have any problems with this product (myself included). My favorite thing about this, as compared to other massage lotions, is that it is perfectly between being too slick and too dry. It is great for deep tissue massage, without slipping greasily over the muscle or having irritating friction on the skin. And by varying the amount applied you can get quite a range of friction or lack there of; perfect for any massage technique I've ever known. I use other massage lotions as well, but only when I have to. This is my go-to, and has been for years now."
1,Don't bother:,"It seems to my that the author either never went to Tibet. If he did he never bothered to learn the language and the translations he got were so misinterpreted that he wrote fantasy instead of fact. I believe that Mr. Waddell wrote the book from his armchair and used fantasy and other books. The original was written @ 1900, so the books that he had to rely on were sparse and were not very insightful into the real Tibet of the time, or were plain fantasy. It is amazing that he wrote such a long book (I guess that he had nothing else to do for a while.) Though there are a very few facts about Tibet in the author's book, most of it is wrong and very misleading. I suggest that you pass this one up or read it as you would a fairy story."
2,NOT A WINNER,"It looks like I must be in the minority in my opinion, but I found this book totally unsatisfying. I didn't care for the heroine, could not connect with the hero, the story line was not at all interesting and the writing was almost juvenile. Was this DD's first novel? Do yourself a favor and skip this one and go directly to DD's ""DARK OF THE NIGHT"". Now that is a good book and a keeper!"
2,A disappointment.,"I have to say that I was disappointed by this book. The characters seemed very 2 dimensional. Both the main characters had a past but they were able to get past them a little too quickly for my liking. The female was weak and looking for a man to save the day, which is just what the man wanted to do. It was too sickly sweet for my taste. There were a few twists and turns and I liked the Irish setting, but for the most part I ended up skimming."
4,A Fast Read,"This is my 1st Dee Davis book and I found it enjoyable. The characters were likable and the story good but predictible. All in all, it was good and I would recommend it."
1,Totally disappointed!,"When I read Davis' first book, EVERYTHING IN ITS TIME, I loved it. It had everything I enjoyed reading in a romance...time travel or other wise. When I saw that she had written a romantic suspense I snatched it right up. I am the type of reader who read all genre of books and am always happy when my authors delve from one genre to an other. Keeps me on my toes. However, this book was terrible. It bored me right from the beginning. The romance was laughable. In a word...corny. The mystery was okay, but not very well set up. I almost put this book down a few times but forced myself to finish it in the hopes that I will be pleastantly surprised with the ending. No true. It ended exactly as I expected. Save your money...get this from a used bookstore if you feel you HAVE to read it. Even its already low price is still too much."
4,Excellent content!,Excellent content but the photos are not the best. Most photos are in black and white. The information though is top notch. Would recommend this book highly for all!!!!!
3,"Very dry and in depth, but informative.","This would be a great reference if you were to have to do a report on the breed. It is very in depth and informative. It was a little too dry for just casual reading. All and all, a great book."
2,"Mostly useless information, unless you want a dry history lesson","If you want a book that is biased and prefers American Dobermans over European, then this book may be for you. Almost all of the detailed information in this book is about breeding, showing, and most definately the history of the breed. When it comes to the important details of raising a doberman and caring for it, the specifics are not there, it is very vague and opinionated on that subject. The book is extremely dry and a boring read. The first half of the book is like reading the beginning of the Bible, this dog begat that dog and this dog begat that dog and we think this is how it was and we think this was what happened...blah blah blah. I have found 100 times more useful information on the breed by just going to this doberman website [...]Don't waste your money, unless you are interested in a dry history lesson. I am not hating, I am just being honest. You deserve to know."
2,The Doberman Pinscher,Nicely presented. I didn't appreciate the European/German dogs being slated so openly. This is a German dog after all. Even the fact that the Americans can't give the breed the correct spelling 'Dobermann' just shows how arrogant they are. The fact that the Americans have watered down the temperament is so sad. I have a bitch of Italian/Yugoslavian bloodlines and I personally don't know how you could want to possible tone her down. So... I would rather not have bought it. Soured the whole thing for me.
5,"A MUST own Doberman book, whether you already own one or not","This book went beyond my expectations as far as complete information on Doberman Pinschers. Whether you are looking into the breed for the first time and maybe just want a campanion, or you have a desire to breed, or even show, this book written wonderfuly by the two authors, covers all one book can. This book covers topics on Dobermans in a way that I felt I had really learned something."
5,Get this one!,"Breeder recommened this to me and must concede that it is one of the most comprehensive works on the breed. Good history, fine points on character, working abilities, breeding, illness & disease, all the way to show information. Great pictures throughout. If it is Doberman Pinscher information you seek, look here."
1,Good Only For A Year,The dartboard lasted about over a year. Then the heckler speaker gave out and its sound is barely audible now. Without the sound it's no longer fun so we are thinking about replacing it with another brand. How can a dartboard with a Arachnid brand name last only this short? We contacted customer service and was told we need to ship it for repairs which cost almost the same as buying a new unit. Doesn't make any sense.
1,Good while it lasted .,I bought this item for Xmas . Worked really well while it lasted . Problem is it only lasted for 3 dart sessions . The screws that hold the front of the board to the back all came loose. All the pressure plates that detect dart location fell out and the item became junk. Guess I better find a spot for a real steal tip board . Don't by this piece of !@#$ !
2,"Fun product, lousy customer service.","We received this dartboard as a gift. It is great when it works. After about six games it started shutting off at random times. Sometimes it is just the backlight for the numbers, other times the whole board shuts off. I have tried to contact the manufacturer several times via phone and their web page over the past two weeks. They have not returned my calls or messages."
4,"If you like the powerpop (i.e. Beatlesque songs w/rockin' guitars), buy it","Great album...not as good as ""Teenage Symphonies to God"" but few records are...if you're a Matthew Sweet fan, def. check out VC"
4,"5 stars for the show, -1 for the DVD","I absolutely love The Shield. It's one of the few programs that frames gender, class and race in a way that doesn't come across as preachy while still keeping in tone with an incredibly realistic ""cop drama"" feel.My issues are with the lack of a ""play all"" feature. (Personally, this drives me absolutely batty.) The majority of TV on DVD sets I own are priced lower than The Shield and all of them include a ""play all"" feature. Otherwise, I don't have any issues with the DVDs themselves. The extras are cool, especially the commentary given before each deleted scene, so I guess that's the tradeoff? Hmph."
4,AMAZING,This is the best show on TV. Watching both 1st and 2nd season straight through (or at least in a shorter time period) adds so much more. Makes the stories and the plot that much deeper.Great purchase
5,The Shield,"I noticed this series when it suprisingly won an Emmy for Michael Chiklis for best Actor, TV Drama. Then it won a Golden this year for best TV series, Drama. I finally bought the DVD and have been glued to my TV since. This is the best series on TV, period. It has taken police drama to another level never, ever seen before. Every episode grips you and never lets you go. Michael Chiklis and company are superb in their roles. I have been watching it on FX ever since and just can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD."
3,totally dramatized and twisted cliches,"small timer-like drama, annoying hip-hop music. unconvincing baldy guy playing tough, totally absurd strike team leader could kick police captian's behind all the time and anytime he wants. 100% copycatting 'ny blue'(even the setting of the police station looks alike)+'law&order;'+'soprono', but twisted and ridiculed the ethics of policing and organization chart to the extreme. making the city of los angeles uglier than ever, angelinos more pathetic than ever.if you could accept bad guy is also a good father, a good collegue, a sometimes good, sometimes evil and that's human, and that's normal, what else's new? what else could be impossible? anything goes, man, if you could really accept it, enjoy the ride."
2,You've already seen it,"Low budget oater that has a weary familiarity. Various conspiracies and plot twists seem contrived for the purposes of making a punchy and fast moving show rather than one that is entirely credible. Would mackey really have got away with beating that pervert over the head with a telephone directory? America is the home of the lawsuit. Chiklis is no Dennis Franz either. He can't carry the show. The boss can't cut it either. The black detective gives the best performance. Couldn't help but smile, though, at that bit when the crook Mackey is chasing jumps over wooden door in an alley and Mackey crashes straight through it like a bull and collars him."
1,great show!! Not so great DVD's....,"so this is by far my favorite television series to date and I highly recomend it to anyone. With that being said I was very excited after ordering the first six seasons while deployed to come home and enjoy the show with m wife. unfortunately for us disc three of season one simply didnt work, Maybe I got the one bad apple in the bunch who knows, but maybe you should also consider looking around a bit before settling on this particular purchase."
5,One of the best TV series I've ever seen.,"This show is much better then I expected it to be. After watching Pilot episode I could not stop watching and I finished the whole season in a couple of days. Those who like ""Training Day"" and ""The Sopranos"" should watch this show. My friends also love it. Unfortunately, they don't show it on TV or cable here in Australia. I am definately going to buy the second season when it comes out. This show kept me on the edge of my seat."
4,Excellent show,I don't even like cop shows but this show is in a league of its own. Don't let it turn you off just cause it's about cops. It's the second best t.v. series I've ever seen. Only beat out by 24 and that's saying a whole lot. You have to see it.
5,Great season,I am so happy I got the 1st season. It's great. Can't wait to get all the seasons. Better than I expected. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
5,One of the greatest TV dramas ever made!,"The Shield is without a doubt one of the best TV drama shows ever made. The ensemble cast is extraordinary. In addition, several superstars, such as Glenn Close and Forest Whittaker, were on for an entire season. The writing is excellent, with many plot twists and turns that makes for an engrossing storyline. The character development gives each member of the cast a very complex persona. There are very few television shows I am addicted to and The Shield is one of them."
5,THE BEST!!!,"I am policemen in Latin America since 16 years ago and I never heard and watched any police drama like that!! The situations, the talks, the manners everything take your attention to the screen.If you didn't watch yet don't waist time and run you won't repent.Guys never stop make this series."
4,Getting away from Tuscan groupy mush,"Having a love for Tuscany and Umbria but not the income to live there, my partner and I read with some initial pleasure two books by people who renovated villas at vast cost and labour to the local tradesmen and wrote down lots of recipes - 'hell I'm such a cute and cultured Californian poetess patronising the locals once a year'.Then a friend lent us the Newby version. Forget the rest. Get the best. He and Wanda work hard. They know and respect their neighbours. Crisp words give life to vine-growing, mountains, meals and breakneck roads.This is the one: all else are imitations."
2,a simple personal development book,"If you are looking for a nice and simple personal development book this is it. You can read it in one afternoon and start coaching. I know that David has never had any formal education or coach training before inventing Life Coaching, and now I can understand why.David Rock is a real master at taking the simple and making it simple. I use the results coaching system to help myself and others deal with major health problems. David is a true guru. Just being around him is healing, but using his coaching methods in conjunction with astrological science is really powerful. His approach fits so well with astrology. Try it."
1,Don't waste your money.,This pan is a fine example of JUNK.I tried to cook an egg on the one we had. That was the end of the pan. Even with a bit of oil the egg never came off the pan.A big disappointment coming from Coleman.
1,Pretty Much Disposable,Used this pan on 2 or 3 camping trips and it's completely worthless after just a half-dozen meals. I know it's cheap but it should last longer than it did. Everything sticks to it and the resultant residue is practically impossible to remove.
2,Didn't last,I had high hopes for this little pan but maybe price should have been the clue. Light weight and easy to pack. The attached folding handle worked well and was sturdy enough. To protect the surface I packed mine with an MSR pack Towel.Out of the gate the pan worked well and was non-stick. But after a very short period began to loose it's non stick properties. I was very careful about not over heating it and cleaning it properly but after one season this pan was done.
1,Worthless,"This pan wasn't ""non-stick"". The food (sausage) stuck to it at medium heat and left a burnt black residue that wouldn't come off. The residue caused the food to taste terrible. This pan is now being stored in a landfill. Don't waste your money!!!"
4,Fretless AZM - Sunday Afternoon Barbeque Music,"The prolific Max Brennan appears once again as Fretless AZM, this time with the album Sunday Afternoon Barbeque Music (otherwise titled Ultimate Maxploitation). And, again, his free-wheeling electronic jazz is sure to please. ""Neurologikian"" is a deep hit from the funk pipe, while ""Finger"" shows the possible of combining jam-band jazz with electronics. ""From Horus Hawk to Uri Geller"" grounds everything with a solid house beat and some catchy synth lines; ""Breeze,"" on the other hand, goes a more mellow route; ""Dreamland"" starts off hypnotic, then throws in a gentle synth line. ""Bumbuphone"" has a crazy horn pipe in about two minutes from the end. Though in places this album can be rough, the better tracks more than make up for it."
4,Great price but nothing to write home about,"These earrings are very nice for the price. I'm not crazy over them, but they do sit well and show nicely below the ear. They will make very nice lightweight summer earrings, which is basically what I was looking for when ordering them. The curve in the wire setting allows the stones to face out & forward much more than some lever-back earrings where the stone tends to aim down at the shoulders. The lever-backs are a bit flimsy to what I'm used to wearing even on less expensive fashion jewelry. I also wish the stones' color was as intense as the picture depicts them. They do give off a glint of shimmer, but they are actually a very light yellow, rather than the deep gold that is pictured."
2,Vague and inconclusive,"While there is an immensely broad array of career counseling topics covered in this book, it is extremely poorly written and is of little use. The author fails to define the key terms, and only vaguely discusses the key concepts. For example, Zunker fails to effectively explain Donald Super's career maturity factors e.g., Zunker full definition of Super's crystallization of traits is, ""individual progress toward forming a self concept."" In addition, Zunker writes in an extremely passive, wordy, vague style more tailored to impress academics than to be relevant for students."
4,A full exposure of the topic - from History to Application,"I read all the other reviews, I get a feeling they are all from students. As a practicing professional in this field for the past 20 years, I can say that as Boles'""What Color is your Parachute"" is the bible for Job Seekers, Zunker's ""Career Counseling: Applied concepts of Life Planning"" is the bible for the Career Counselor. I find Zunker's information well exposed for easy comprehension. His writing style is simple and straight-forward. I believe the book is well structured for its purpose and didn't get a 5 star rating because It should be more economical in pricing."
2,not recommended covers too much for one book,"I used this book for a graduate career counseling course. It didn't set career development in an economic history which would explain why theory developed the way it did. Additionally, the book doesn't explain many of the theories so the student can dilineate the differences between them. the author states that career counseling will soon integrate with other forms of counseling and yet, he doesn't point out obvious relationships between career theory and other psychological and developmental theories. There is a lot of guidence on counseling which covers both general and career skills. I would have liked the assessment section to be much bigger and more practical and the school assessment section to be much smaller. Zunker has an assessment book and should probably take his huge section on school counseling and make a book from that. All together the book was very dry and boring."
1,Can I get my money back?,Like the other review this is a book I used for a graduate class in ed counseling. I needed safety pins to keep my eyes open. This book is too broad and covers too much. If I ever wanted to go into career counseling I wont now cause its toooooooo boring after this book.
5,colemas round fireplace with wheels and cover,This product was exactly what I ordered. It arrived very promptly. I am very pleased with my order and would buy again. Thank you!
5,This is a fantastic book!,"If you're someone who's interested in changing the planet and help shaping the future of culture this book is not to be missed. Joanna Macy lays things out in a such a provocative, yet non-academic way. it's an easy read in that it's written chock full of information, yet from the heart. enjoy!"
3,Could have been a contender,"Fabulous musicianship, flawless execution, decent charts, great production (given the likely limited budget), but missing the mark/spark. Perfect for The Weather Channel, sadly.I was particularly disappointed with the drum machine tracks. Some of them sounded like they dragged the 808 out of the closet and in a half-hour's time poked in a loop and some robot fills. This sort of music demands a human, in my opinion.A little of John Guerin, or Steve Gadd, or Andy Newmark, or a lot more Ricky Lawson, etc., etc., and it could have been great."
1,a poorly written rough draft of a book,"This is an awful book from start to finish. It contains little historiography and is poorly written. Bentley spends a lot of space on the universities attended by historians and other useless details and not enough space explaining their ideas.Bentely uses foreign phrases and block quotes on EVERY single page. At times he combines both beasts by having block quotes in a foreign language WITHOUT giving a translation.But the last item may be preferable since Bentley is at his worst in his own language. The students in my class are always complaining about the writing. The professor is constantly apologizing for it. Maybe Bentley will do the same someday by revising this book. While this book is not a first draft, it is not a final one either. Good bye and good luck - or as Bentley would say, au revior and in bocca al lupo"
1,Dissapointing.,"Had all the makings of a great book, but the analysis is shallow and very unbalanced. Unfortunately, like some of the activist movements it discusses, the book makes a passionate presentation of serious problems that should be addressed, but fails to propose viable and practicable solutions to these issues."
5,great foo fighters biography,"For any true fan or anyone interested in how and where the Foo Fighters came from, this cd does a great job. It goes into great detail on Dave Grohl's musical upbringing from his first band up to joining Nirvana. A lot of info is brought into play on why Dave Grohl made the infamous Pocketwatch Demo some time after the demise of Nirvana to the now familiar change in the Foo Fighters' lineup. There's a wealth of background info for any fan of the Foo Fighters. Yet ironically enough the only music that is on the cd is purely background music that is not Foo Fighters. All in all it is a cd well worth having for any Foo Fighters fan library."
1,Cheap Looking,"The face on the watch is like a gold mirror, contrary to what the picture looks like. The part of the band you can see in the picture is turned permanently in a curved position so the watch will not lay flat on a table when you take it off. The band feels like cheap plastic. I was very disappointed with it. Don't waste your money."
4,A SURPRISING RELEASE,"I recently saw this film in Los Angeles at a screening there when I was visiting a friend and was surprised that I had not heard more about it. Good film. Well Made and full of hotties. Natalie Kelly is smoking in this. She oozes Sex when she is on screen. Jesse Metcalf gives a great performance along side Johnny Messner (WHO IS CRAZY IN THIS), Corrupt, Chase Crawford, Vinnie Jones, Lochlyn Munro, and Corey Large. The cast is great, the acting is good, and the film is interesting in its style, plot and execution. Again the girls were hot!!!I dug the score and source music in the film. It overall has a very fresh and young vibe to it. Would recommend it to those looking for something to caters to that Fast and Furious crowd. Good flick."
1,"An after school special, but worse...","Wow. This movie is horrible. Guy goes to strip club meets stripper, smokes pot, and a week later he is addicted to coke, has pretty much dropped out of law school, is cheating on his girl and is pulling guns on people. Yeah. Ok. He does coke 3 times yet he goes through withdrawals in jail. Really?The chicks are ok, but not enough to save the rest of the movie. If you want to see a guy in a bowling shirt acting like a wanna be gangster then this is your movie. This would fit better as a Lifetime network movie of the week... I bet my Mom would love this movie."
2,aggressively mediocre,"This movie wasn't even bad enough to be interesting. Tristan used to be a party boy till his girlfriend OD'd at a party, and now he's just turned 25 and getting ready for lawschool. A crazy birthday night leads him to his old drug dealer, Sebastian. He gets back into the party lifestyle because of a hot stripper. No other reason. Forget that he has a fiancee that he supposedly loves. Tristan is apparently the kind of guy who just does whatever a stronger person tells him, whether that's his dad or his dealer. Why should we have any sympathy for someone like that? The movie flips around from Crank-ripoff to morality play to mystery-thriller with no sense of direction whatsoever. There's really only a grand total of 15 minutes of action, and most of those take place in the last 10 minutes of the movie. If you have to watch this movie, just watch the first 15 and last 15 minutes."
4,"Expensive Tap, but was needed for the job","Spend nearly $40 on shipping for this special tap (thought it was expensive, I know I needed THIS special size but man $40 sounded high). There was a stripped screw hole on my timing chain cover for my 1998 Saturn SC2 DOHC, the tap worked. Notice this DOES NOT COME WITH A DRILLBIT! ONLY the tap and T-handle, and a tool to insert the helicoil inserts. The inserts were a bit ""cheap"" and not big enough for my job, so I purchased some McMasterCarr inserts which were better quality. Overall, the TAP was good, the helicoil special tool to insert the helicoil inserts. The helicoil inserts it came with were cheap, so plan on buying some from McMaster Carr. If I may suggest next time I'm thinking of inserting a better quality insert not a helicoil. But overall my motor mount is connected to my timing chain cover and this did do the job. 4 out of 5."
2,Disappointed with the tap,"This 'kit' was 60$ at the local hardware store, decided to order from here. Used it on some mild steel as directed i drilled out the hole and used the tap to make new threads. While backing out the edges of the tap decided to split off of the tap. The coil barely went in but i used loctite on it and broke the pin off and it works but i cant use the other 9(of 10) coils because the special tap is broken."
4,Grail of tap and die,If you are at a last resort this is the way to go. Used this to repair stripped out forward controls on a Honda Shadow frame.
5,Best Buffy Season EVER,"This has to be easily the best Buffy season ever. Well ok, maybe this and season 2. The heartbreak during this season is gut wrenching, and the stories are incredible. Buffy finally is forced to grow up for the first time. And Joss really comes into his own. This show for the first few seasons was the BEST writing on television. If you only get one DVD set, get this one."
5,best...,buffys best faith is sobad the last episode when buffy and her fight was the greatest i alwys cheer for buffy but faiths so delicious i cheered for her she beat buffy upbad theres not one bad episode in season 1 and 2 there was in episode that wasnt thjat good
4,New Shows,"Quite a few new shows have come out recently that try to capitalize off of the success of the first WB hit show, Buffy. Buffy basically launched WB TV but it is outdated now and there is a younger generation of viewers that would like to see what happened after the Buffy thing was over. The real reason people like vampires is because of the fear of HIV and other same sex type of relationships. Then there is a mtv generation that changed the way women are seen as popular heroes and capable of fighting for themselves."
1,Juvenile,"I find no quality in this program. The writing, acting and directing will never live up to that of a true show."
5,the season that started my addiction,my roommate...oh so many years ago...first got me hooked to the rediculous 'buffy the vampire slayer'.... are you kidding? people actually watch that show who are over the age of 12? Yes. And I am one of them. the convert.
5,One of the best seasons,besides buffy faith is my favorite character thats why i give this 5 stars. too bad faith becomes pyscho. but still a great show
4,Alyson Hannigan steals the show,"Once again Alyson hannigan shows in this season she is a great actress. She plays Willow the shy computer nerd and an evil Vampire, proving she can play any part. Why she didn't get her own spin-off like Angel, i'll never understand. I guess the ""Buffy"" series needs her to stay interesting. Sarah always looks like she phones her part in. The others look like there reading telaprompters. Except for Eliza Dushku she does a great job acting also. She brought a little more support for Hannigan. So Hannigan fans and Dushku fans will really enjoy this seoson of Buffy."
5,Buffy Season Three! Three times as good!,"If you thought Buffy season 2 was intense and excellent, Season 3really ups the ante, and Joss introduces some great new characters:Faith, The Mayor, Trick, Wesley, Gwendolyn Post etc. Eliza Dushkuis sexy and slinky as the rogue slayer Faith and the viewer feels asthough Joss Whedon is really doing a great job in expanding the Buffyuniverse. I loved all Buffy's seasons, but Season 3 is one of the best!"
5,"If you only buy one season of Buffy, get Season 3!","I'm a big fan of the show overall, but this season is my favorite. The show isn't shot in widescreen yet, but they upgraded the film for season 3 and you can really tell. Awesome quality on an awesome set! Worth it just for The Wish and Dopplegangland, but the rest is great too!"
5,Gotta have it,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is surprising one of the best shows I've watched in recent years. With a rich cast of characters that bring emotional depth to a fantastic story, any of the seasons are worth owning.I was also impressed with how quickly it shipped. Thanks!"
5,Addicting!!,"Season 3 of 'Buffy' continues with the dark tone of the 2nd year, while finishing some storylines that went unresolved, and setting up some new ones. It is by far the most addicting year of the series, playing like a soap opera that doesn't want to let go. I stopped watching the series after the first episode of this season, so thank goodness for the DVD sets. Once I popped this baby in, I COULD NOT stop watching. While it does start off a bit weak, this amazing series grows and ends strong in every possible way.Anya and Faith; two of my favorite 'Buffy' characters; are introduced here, and this season brilliantly foreshadows what will come later in the show. I am continually amazed with the show's exceptional writing and brillint acting, as well as the well-developed characters and complicated storylines. By the time you finish these episodes, the series will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake. Recommended!!"
5,THE THRID SEASON KICKS BUTT!,"Season three is by far the best season ever! Slayer against slayer is pure genious! I love it and this is when things start to go bonkers for the gang and they start to come to a close and grow into adulst and leave behind the child in them, they grow as a whole but yet grow apart as they start lives as individuals."
4,Buffy the Vampire 3rd Season,Thank you for the CD's. My teenage daughter loves it. She has all of the other seasons CD's and was worried she would never find the 3rd season.Thank you.
3,"correct title, but...","Was sent the correct title, and it came pretty fast, however I searched for the ""Slim Set"", and clicked on this one since it states it is the ""slim set"". However, what I received in the mail was not, it was the old thick case, which is not what I wanted/ordered and does not match the rest of my set."
5,Must have for any Buffy Fan!,If you love Buffy The Vampire Slayer then this is a sure buy! I Dvd's are great quality and full of special features.
5,"The Best Season, Even Slimmer!","These ""Slim Sets"" are getting even slimmer, now six discs just maybe a couple millimeters wider than a regular DVD...which RULES.Also, what more could be said about Buffy? It rules, but this season features:1. The best Big Bad ever, the Mayor!2. uhh, FAITH!3. Oz being awesome.4. Two words: Band Candy."
3,weak,"I have to admit, alot of this season's episode was really boring and fraustrating. I mean, it's already bad enough that Buffy's mom and Principal Snyder being getting in the way by activating their "" adult authority"", but the evil mayor just have to step it. The most disappointing was the part where Angel came back from Hell, if the big ideal is that Angel/Buffy relationship couldn't last because of his vampiric condition. why did he make up with Buffy again and then at the end of the season suddenly realized that he should break up with Buffy. It's even weaker when it's the evil mayor who made Angel realized this. The whole Prom episode is just a really big waste of time because you could really watch it and say: "" BIG DUH"" throughout the whole season I expected B/A relationship would take a different turn rather than the same old season two and suddenly Angel and his big Duh step up and breaks up with Buffy. overall, this season is a big disappointment"
3,product review,product appears in great shape till episodes 5-8 on disc four are missing. placed complaint with buyer with no response shortly after delivery.
5,I Have to Agree With Everyone,"Season three is by far the best Season for Buffy. So many exciting things happened that you could swear it was at least two seasons rolled into one. I LOVE Faith...she brought plenty of action on to the screne with her. I wish she didn't go all evil and all. I've heard she'll be back this season, I hope so. I can't wait for season 4 either...that was another good season but it didn't have as much action as season 3."
4,Very strong,"A very strong season. One of the main reasons is the character of Faith who is troubled but compelling. The Mayor is one of the series' greatest villains. The major weakness is Buffy/Angel's typical teenage romance. It's quite soapy, melodramatic and repetitive.Overall, I recommend this season. It's not perfect but the plot is strong and the characterizations are consistent."
5,even better with Faith,"I'm already a Buffy fan. I love the infusion of new slayers, especially Faith, who seems to be the antithesis of Buffy's persona."
3,"great show, ok dvd set","this is one of my favorite shows, it,s one of the few shows that got better with each season, but the dvd set was not as good as the sets for seasons 1 and 2, it seems the season 3 set did,t have as many extras as the other box sets, i hope the season 4 box set will have more and better extras. I like to see outtakes from the shows, interviews with each cast member, better behind the scenes stuff."
4,"Solid heft, looks great, writes well","I bought this for myself and I'm enjoying it. It is a bit heavier than some pens and a bit larger in diameter, which I like. I've had several people make positive comments, because it does look more expensive than it is. It would make an excellent gift for someone who still uses a pen often, and I intend to keep that in mind myself for future reference. The only drawback is that is that at a length of 4.75 inches, it's a little shorter than I'd prefer, which is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. The same pen is also available in some other colors."
1,Rough grip and really bad smell.,"At first I was excited to have this for my steering wheel. The top/bottom parts are really smooth but the middle parts are rough. So when you go to turn, it rubs against your hands. It also has a really bad odor that fills up the whole car and my hands. I took the cover off and wiped down my steering wheel, but there is still an odor that gets on my hands. I am returning this item and I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great Quality and Convenience,The reviews I read were very helpful in fiding the stand I wanted. This stand is super cheap and just outstanding. It even feels solid and well built. I really was suprised what I got for my money and am extreamly satisfied.
5,My favorite guitar stand,"Nicely made ... Looks and feels like a quality product ... Works well, too .."
1,Deserves a ZERO,"I sought out this stand in an effort to avoid the vinyl-based padding used on cheaper stands--vinyl reacts with the nitrocellulose lacquer used on Gibson (and other traditionally finished guitars). Unfortunately, this stand was only good for about 18 months of very light use around my home. Eventually, the lock that holds the legs in place when they're deployed failed. I sent it to Ultimate Support, who determined that I qualified to give them $19 for a refurbished stand to ""replace"" the defective unit. No thanks.So, my search continues for a better-quality stand than this one. At least I can say that I've narrowed my search down... I won't need to look at anything that Ultimate Support sells. Thanks for that, at least."
1,this stand sucks,"this product is not worthy. The platic and carbon parts are easiliy crack. Even though ultimate support said that it was lifetime warranty, it doesn;t provide the replacement or fixed. Do not buy this item. This is just a piece of junk."
2,A Fair Movie,"I saw this one in the theater way back when. It's got a good cast (of British actors) but otherwise it's not so great. AIP released it in the U.S. but the print here says....""Columbia Pictures Presents..."" Go figure!"
5,"Anne Murray, ""Country Croonin""","Anne Murray at her very best....Surely, she can't get better than this.Every track a gem...sung as only Anne Murray can. Instrumental backing is superb. I have most of hers(and mine) favourite melodys on various forms of media, but not all contained on one disc like this one....brilliant."
5,safe and what you would expect from battery powered tea lights,I got these to put into freestanding lace votives and lace carousel ornaments for a tree. Perfect for this. Pretty too but haven't seen them at night yet. Battery life I don't know because these are gifts.
5,Perfectly cute,"I bought these to use for my dsughter's birthday Tea Party as part of the center piece. They all worked well and the girls thought they were a wonderful touch. No flame, beautiful lights and colors. Very bright."
1,not enough light,"they are okay for dim lighting, but not powerful, maybe good for the window during halloween, not thrilled with product quality"
3,christmas music,"this was a very nice cd for quiet listening, but it did not inspire any emotional feelings."
3,Mixed reviews,I have been working with relaxation tapes and CDs since the early 1980s. This particular alblum is good in some places and sucks in others.
5,So relaxing!,Great background music! I played it all season long! Now I need a CD like this for the rest of the winter season that isn't Christmas music! :-)
2,Didn't do a thing for me.,"I was disappointed in this CD. I think I was looking for relaxing, instrumental versions of Christmas music. This one just didn't do a thing for me. After one listen, I gave it away."
5,Simply beautiful!,"Awesome moody sounds, great performance by Mantovani and his orchestra! Highly recommended! I love this collection, especially ""Adeste Fideles"" (O come, all ye faithful). Wonderful!"
3,"SOME INSTRUMENTAL, SOME SINGING","After listening to this CD, I can't say it's anything different from the hundreds of other Christmas CDs. I had hoped for all instrumental but several songs are sung by a choir. A nice mix, if that's what you want, but most of the music I've heard many times before. I think the title could have left off the Relaxation part of the title."
3,Below Expectations,I just expected better quality. More strings would have been better. Two much brass. Too much brass doesn't equal relaxation.
4,"The Present Is OK.....NOW, anyway...","Kelley Stoltz has given you the BEST--bar none--homemade record EVER. True, you'd never mistake this for a big-budget production, and that's what pushes it over the top.The main attraction--the songs themselves. These tunes would be wonderful regardless of the treatment they received. Do you miss the days when every song on an album sounded DIFFERENT? Then this is the next CD you need to buy, Bucky.I'll confess I don't really hear the Beefheart everyone else is talking about....that component is a little bit closer to the Three Johns jamming with the Crusaders......(shudder!) But there are healthy dollops of everything from Nick Drake to Bauhaus.....and an absolutely chilling Syd Barrett-inspired song, ""Vapor Trail,"" which makes Robyn Hitchcock sound like Andy Kim.You NEED this album."
2,leave it in the past and move into the glow,"I'm glad I heard Antique Glow before I heard the Past was Faster. If it had been the other way around, I might have not have even cared to go check out Antique Glow.This cd has a handful of gracious moments. The rest I would describe as Kelley sponging his influences and lacking the refinement/talent to wring out his own style. If you'd like to hear him in the beginning stages of discovering his own voice and laying down tracks that sound more like incomplete compositions, you may want to pick this up.I'd suggest Antique Glow instead of this album. On that album your palette won't be overwhelmed with the aromas of Robyn Hitchcock, Nick Drake, Syd Barrett, Beatles, Captain Beefheart, etc. like it will be here."
5,Personaly...,"I know Kelly personaly, and he probably forgot me though.I bought the CD, and lent it to my half little bro, who now has it stored away some were, so i need a new one! And I can't see how any one would want to sell it if they bought it. I loved it, expecialy the ""secret"" track at the very end. X-Ray eyes stays in my mind even though I havn't heard it for 2 years!The Past Was Faster is an insperational album to all young musicians, and I think if Kelly deserves a round of aplause for his effort, acomplishment, and the fact that he is a very cool guy!"
2,Meh,"I have seen this movie before, maybe it was on broadcast TV. Now I've seen it on blu-ray. The movie is mostly depressing. It takes place in a small southern town. The people who live in this town are either bored or depressed. About the only happy person in this picture is the town hooker. It seems everyone has her telephone number, she makes house calls! Also great at polite small talk. Halle Berrys and Billy Bob Thorton's charactures seems to have more than their fair share of problems. It's also so quiet I had to rewind and turn up the volume to hear some of the dialogue.There are a few scenes you might find disturbing.However the ending was happy. That always works for me"
2,Monsters Ball Blu-Ray,"The video (Blu-Ray) part, of the DVD was fine, but the audio of the DVD did not match the Blu-Ray player... Audio was slightly off."
3,Monster's Ball - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Lionsgate / Region A, B, CAspect ratio: 2.35:1MPEG-4 AVC BD-25 / AACS / High Profile 4.1Running time: 1:52:42Movie size: 21,87 GBDisc size: 24,99 GBTotal bit rate: 25.88 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 20.29 MbpsDTS-HD Master Audio English 3912 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3912 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby SurroundSubtitles: English SDH / SpanishNumber of chapters: 16# Audio Commentary with Director and Writers# 4 Deleted scenes (SD - 4 minutes)#Featurettes--On the set (SD - 4 minutes)--Behind the scenes with Producer (SD - 18 minutes)--The cast and crew interviews - (SD - 19 minutes)#Music for the film (SD - 8 minutes)#Theatrical trailer"
3,Not a mesmerizing film,"Did Halle Berry deserve an Academy Award for her performance? Perhaps. She had a wide range of emotions to scale and did it effectively, not to mention engaging in a soft core porn scene. I found Billy Bob Thornton's performance effective as well, but he was stuck with a character who is confusing and inexplicable. He goes from raving racist who scares off two black kids with a gun to Berry's sensitive lover. He's downright obsessive about his trips to the restaurant for ice cream, but we never learn why. The latter half of the movie largely drags along toward an ineffective ending that simply fades into a starry sky with nothing finalized.While there are good things to say about Monster's Ball, there are much better ways pass an evening than watching this film."
4,even w/o 2pac outlawz still shine!,"This is a great album. You can catch the outlawz on 2pacs greatest songs such as hit em up bombs 1st and hail mary, hot beats and great vocals. A must have for 2pac fans"
5,I love this book,"This book really stands out, it's not like any other book Ive seen for kids thats for sure. I bought it for a gift for my little brother but then I had to order one for myself. The pictures of horris are really great, they really stand out."
1,MY SON (8) HATED THIS BOOK!,"My son,(8), who is a fan of scary stories (Goosebumps, etc.), thought this book was just terrible. He thinks it's mostly for adults."
4,"In Space, No One Can Hear You Fart","I really enjoyed this stupid movie.If you thought Armageddon was lame, and AIRPLANE! was great, then you'll definitely get a kick out of DISASTER! It's got a bunch of great characters, with a parody story, and lots and lots of cool animation throughout. I recommend watching this with a good crew over a couple cases of beer or whatever makes you giggle and be obnoxious.p.s. I don't know what Motley Crue had to do with this... they are grossly miscredited as being Stars of this movie."
3,HUH? You made this movie Why?,"This movie is a cross between a low-budget Robot chicken and Team America so if you appreciate dolls humping then buy this film as it has it in droves. This movie was not terrible, but not on par with robot chicken as it was not very funny despite it's trying very hard to be."
1,Not worth $10,"I purchased Disaster! The Movie thinking it was done by the same people that make Robot Chicken, seeing as how Amazon suggested it when I was purchasing Seasons 1 - 3. It is not. I watched it and it had some laughs but was truly not worth the money I spent. My suggestion is rent it somewhere then make your own decision whether you want to purchase it or not. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,dimensions?,What the heck are the dimensions? Can't find them anywhere. Difficult to buy the product if I don't know the size!
1,Are you serious?,This game is for people to play if they're drunk or mindless...or in some cases both....it's completely pointless and uninteresting...if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid...sorry but i mean think about it?...why PAY MONEY for this when i can JUST USE DICE from OTHER MORE INTERESTING board games I already own? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!~*Even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little...you still shouldn't buy it...b/c like i said before JUST USE DICE FROM OTHER BOARD GAMES YOU ALREADY OWN!
2,Wrong Color,I ordered this particular bunco set because the company's description said it was PINK! I received a very ugly cream and red set.
3,Easy game and lots of fun,"Bunco is an easy to learn dice game and lots of fun. We played our first game in our neighborhood recently and everyone enjoyed it. It's a great way to keep in touch with friends and neighbors. This game has everything you need to play and get started. I don't care for the score pads that are included, so I found some free ones on the internet bunco site."
4,Bunco is Bunco,The set is great and the rule book refreshed my memory. The Item did not come in the color shown. I wanted a pink one and I got a red and taupe set. Kind of disappointing.
2,Boring...,"I played this game a bunch of times today. The game was pointless, slow, and boring. The only thing I liked was ringing the bell. The point of the game is to roll 21 ones, then twos, then threes, etc. How lame is that.I recommend you try Yatzee instead."
5,Thrill of It All,"Thrill of It All being a 4 cd multi-box set released 1995 is a real dandy of a release and was received well by the critics. Allmusic gave it 4.5 stars and I give it 5 stars. Here we get all the Roxy Music hits from ""Do the strand"" to ""Avalon"" and many more. In fact we also get some tracks not released on CD prior to this release. The booklet is massive and contains 68 pages. We get liner notes written for many of the tracks and many great photographs from the time when the albums were recorded. 5/5."
1,DVD mastered incorrectly?,"I loved the ""movie"" Splatter. Cheesy 80s crap, but that's why I bought it. Unfortunately, it won't work in any of my DVD players. I suspect a faulty mastering of the DVD. There were no scratches or obvious physical defects. I was able to rip it to the hard drive and watch it (could probably burn it to a DVD-R, too), so I didn't bother with a return. The DVD is worth far less than my time."
5,Kenmore Elite Micro/Convection Oven,"I have the bigger Kenmore Elite 1.5 cf. I really like the sensor cooking, and all that you can do with it. Bakes, Roast, Microwave,defrost,convection, and convection/microwave cooking. Hope this helps you to decide."
4,FAST,"Shipping with this seller was FAST. the product came in two days, MUCH earlier than the expected 5-10 business days :)Regarding product, it was neatly packaged with bubble wrap around it, neat little display box that i folded up. It made me feel like i was in the store while i opened all 24 packs with my cousins :P Got some decent draws, not what i was hoping for but what can i say? these older packs don't come with a rare + extra ultrarare and whatnot, so the ultrarares just replace the regular rare :("
4,OKAY,THIS IS AN OKAY CD I THINK THE CD TO THE FIRST MOVIE IS MUCH BETTER. BUT THEN AGAIN THE FIRSTMOVIE IS BETTER TOO.
5,I absolutely love this cd...,"This cd is well written and composed, so make sure you buy it today! The Amy Winehouse verison of Will You Still Love me Tomorrow"", is so beautifully done!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD specifically for the Amy Winehouse version of ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and it was a faulty recording that skips and is virtually unlistenable. That said, the rest of the CD has some nice cuts on it. The only one that was problematic was the Winehouse song."
4,Nice Album,"Many think this is The Exies first ever cd. And from that I can say your wrong. ""Inertia"" is Exies 2nd album, which sets a nice tone for all of rock n roll. Kicking off with ""My Goddess"", and ending with ""Genius,"" this album fills the space with some really great tracks. Though your taste for Rock n Roll may vary, The Exies unleash a wide varity of tracks from Mellow mood to Hardkore. In my personal opinion, it takes a nice relaxing break sitting down listening to this cd, to really enjoy it. After you find the lyrics to be addicting, this cd with be and overall good cd. So, make sure to take the time and listening to all the songs, to enjoy the cd. For this, I give ""Inertia"" a 4 out of 5 stars."
5,Great rock CD!!,"I bought this album cuz it was supercheap and was pleasantly surprised. The polished sound of the Exies was shocking for a band making their major label debut. There isn't a track I don't like on this album. ""My Goddess"", ""Kicker, ""Can't Relate"", and ""Creeper Kamikaze"" are my favorites. The only beef I have with this disc is the length. It comes in under 40 minutes for 11 tracks, but at least they included the video for ""My Goddess""."
4,Well Worth the Price,"I saw these guys open up for Ra a while back, not knowing much about them. I was quite impressed with there performance so I picked up their cd.... It was well worth the money. It is nothing new or groundbreaking, it's just good modern rock. There are some dark grungy tunes, some ballads, and some pop radio hits. I'm not dissapointed with any songs on the whole album, it is good from start to finish. They remind me a lot like Stone Temple Pilots or some other early nintys band with a modern sound to them. For anyone who likes any sort of rock music they should pick this one up.... You won't be dissapointed."
3,Reminds Me Of...,"I recently heard ""My Goddess"" for the first time, and loved it. I agree that the rest of the songs on the album are a little slower than expected just by listening to ""My Goddess."" People listening to this band most likely already know who Pitchshifter is, but for those of you who don't. Check them out. Just about every pitchshifter song has the energy of ""My Goddess."" If you like that song, you'll love Pitchshifter!!!!!"
3,"decent, but i expected it to be better","This Cd's better than okay but not that good, It's a Cd you would take out once in a great while because your sick of everything else. I thought ""My Goddess"" was a great song when it first came out, it's the greatest song on the album, and I expected more rock from Inertia after listening to ""My Goddess"" but about half the songs are more soft than the average rock song. Here's what I gave each song out of 1 to 10, 1 being totally sucks, 5 being okay, and 10 being one of the greatest songs ever. 1. My Goddess-9/10, 2. Without-8/10, 3. Can't Relate-7.5/10, 4. Kickout-5/10, 5. No Secrets-6/10, 6. Inertia-4/10, 7. Creeper Kamikaze-3/10, 8. Calm & Collapsed-7/10, 9. Lo-Fi-7/10, 10. Irreversible-3/10, 11. Genius-3/10. This album's decent but I think about 85% of my rock albums are better."
2,Too soft,"My goddess is the only song worth listening to on the entire album, the rest sounds like soft, slow garbage from SR-71's File 13. Get their new one instead, which is heavier and pure rock. Half of these songs border on pop-punk, and punk SUCKS!!!"
3,nah....,"Although, I must say.. i like these guys, they are not all the cd description from www.amazon.com makes them out to be... actually, when listening to this cd i was amazed at the often use of voice enhancement (voice box/effects) it kinda saddens me, things like that shouldn't be a huge part of your music unless you wish to become another pop-rock band (read sellouts) like Linkin Park... I feel that the lead singer has an exceptional voice and shouldn't hinder himself with vocal effects, as for the lady writing the review go listen to some hardcore or black metal if you think these guys are ""dark rock"".... even someone like Cold (13 ways to bleed and selftitled, not year of the spider is much heavier in ideals and thought than these guys..."
3,And Average CD,Find a way to listen to some of the tracks other than Goddess before you buy this CD. Goddess has a very different sound than the rest of the CD so make sure you know what your buying.
2,Ummm...Different,"I also picked up thier c.d. when i heard ""My Goddess"" and thought that it was going to have the same tune and rythim kind of thing, but its like 80's soft rock, i mean i regreted that i bought this, what a waste!"
1,Didnt work for me,"I don't know if its just my hair, but this product didn't work as well as I had hoped. It made my hair kind of knotty and not soft at all :("
3,It's ok,"I've had this heater for slightly over a year now (got it in Sep 2010). It worked really well in the beginning for the first winter. Heated up quick, oscillating feature is neat, etc. Cons are that the themostat is really inaccurate and once it reaches my set temp, it seems to stop and doesn't start up again even if the temp goes below my set temperature. Now I'm using it again and find that it doesn't work so well anymore. If I unplug and move it, sometimes it doesn't turn back on for 30min. Same thing happens if the auto turn off is triggered. Seems like something in the circuitry is broken now. I'll be buying a new heater but a different brand."
4,Very pleased,"I purchased two of these, after reading reviews from other customers. I live in a small cabin and otherwise use wood to heat my home. I am very pleased with my purchase. The heater is lightweight, yet puts out a large amount of heat. The safety features are especially welcome; if the heater is moved or just jostled, it immediately turns itself off; and there are no open heat sources to burn little fingers. The built-in thermometer and timer are great features.I didn't give this a 5 star review mainly because I haven't received my electricity bill yet, so I cannot comment on the power usage. But on the other hand, this sure is easier than chopping wood!"
4,honeywell tower heater,"This product pretty much works as described,but it would be nice to be able to direct the flow of warm air downward as the fan tends to direct it upward with no other option."
1,Also feel cheated,"You should definitely alert people to the fact this does not have Paul Newman singing ""Plastic Jesus""---I agree that that would be the only reason to buy the music for ""Cool Hand Luke"".(I wish there was some way to obtain that!)"
3,Cool Hand Luke,"Even though This CD was a very good soundtrack It was not what I was looking for. My husband and I loved the Vocals of the movie, But the Cd was strickly instrumental no singing. He wanted the Song PLASTIC JESUS with the words sung by Paul Newman. Can't seem to find it anywhere Or anyplace> Found Plastic Jesus sung by Billy Idol but did not sound like the song in the movie."
4,Confused,"Several of the reviews claim that this is not the original soundtrack. And yet, Lalo Schifrin, in his notes, suggests otherwise. He credits the original session players, several of whom have passed, and, even more revealing, the album indicates that these tracks are all licensed by MCA records, of which DOT, the original soundtrack l.p. label, was a subsidiary. Additionally, the album, though well-mastered, is clearly a product of pre-Dolby analog recording, replete with audible oxide hiss. I have the DVD of the film, and this certainly sounds like the original soundtrack to me, one of Schifrin's very best film works, and worthy of a place on your soundtrack shelf."
1,Save Your Money,This is not the soundtrack. Don't expect to hear much of anything that resembles the movie.
5,very nice,"I don't really see why people have a problem with this show. I think it's great. The setlist is pretty flawless, and the velvet underground album is a great addition to the ""musical costumes"" phish have ""worn"" over the years. The filler from from the night before makes this a must-own."
4,When Nurses Battled Gangsters,"This is something of an antique, but yet another vintage Pre-Coder. Barbara Stanwyck and her nursing school friend Joan Blondell seem to be forever removing their clothes down to their skivvies while learning about babies and surgery before earning their pins and taking up private duty work. That leads them to a shameful place where a rich lady is doped up by her scheming evil chauffeur Nick, played darkly by young unmoustached Clark Gable. The object of the scheme is to kill off the sick little children of the hophead and I guess marry her to gain control of her considerable fortune. But Nick hasn't bargained on a tough streetsmart nurse like Barbara to save the day, along with her bootlegger beau. Quite a bouncy little ride, you'll see!"
3,Very watchable pre-code melodrama,"Night Nurse has most of the elements that so distingush the pre-code melodrama. Lurid topics such as child abuse, drunkedness, pre-marital sex, greed and dishonesty can all be found here. I found this film very entertaining and very watchable. The plot moves quickly so the film is never boring. Miss Stanwyck and Miss Blondell find several reasons to disrobe during the film making this a delight for the eyes. Clark Gable, in an early supporting role, adds real menace to the part of villian. I think that pre-code film fans will be impressed and will enjoy this movie."
2,I really can't tell if it does what it says.,Because it upset my stomach..I have kindof a touchy stomach and I just can't take these..Too bad I ordered so many !
1,NOT AS PICTURED OR DISCRIBED,"This is not a revolution, does not have the Hydro-hook and is not even close to almost new."
5,You'll be able to catch your son reading under the covers...,"...because he will be laughing so hard he will give himself away. My 7-year-old's passion for reading has been largely fueled by the Time Warp trio. If you are looking for something with boy heros that is engaging and VERY funny (from you kid's perspective), this is for you.Girls too, especially those who appreciate a good booger joke now and then.Makes those Magic Tree House kids look like the Brady bunch."
4,Summer Reading Is Killing Me,"I thought ""summer Reading Is Killing Me"" was okay because it was kind of hard to understand and they had some language problems to. I liked it too because I liked how it used the characters from all the books. They used the characters from ""The 3 Little Pigs."" They had good guys and bad guys. They gad a cage with the good guys in it. They had some bad pictures also. A bad picture was like they had the devil nude. Other than the bad stuff I thought it was awesome!"
2,Fun but flimsy,"My dog immediately loved this toy, but he managed to chew it in half in under five minutes. He's a five-moth-old lab and not a heavy duty chewer. I wish they made one out of tougher rubber!"
1,My dog hates this toy,Got this to replace the tennis ball my dog normally swims after and my dog hates this toy! Won't put it in her mouth in the house and not at all interested in swimming after it even though she loves the water. I don't know if the material tastes weird in her mouth? Total waste of money. Also - this Seller needs to improve their product detail page to give the buyer the option of selecting whatever color they want. Not all of these show up well in the water.
2,Too Small,My Lab did like it but the thing is too small for a Lab. He went to town and took out chunks. Would be perfect if it were thicker and longer. Was disappointed to see this small thing in the mail!
2,There are not Iced Earth songs !!!!,"I bought this BD because i am a big fan of iced earth, and 'voila !' there are not iced earth songs !!!!. Big Mistake !!!."
2,no Iced Earth on this set,I enjoy all the Wacken that I have but being A big Iced Earth fan found this very dissapointing although much better than last years
5,Video games + Beer = Awesome,"I enjoyed this video cause of the nostalgia of seeing the old games being reviewed by people that share the same enthusiasm and joy for video games as myself.I also like the humour and the creative thinking behind all of the reviews, even though it was a low budget show they really made the most of it.Luckily the game room still lives on through youtube.All hail Lord Karnage!"
5,The best video game review show of it's time,"""This has got to be for me the greatest video game review show that I have seen for it's time. It was funny and great but sadly I was not there when it first premiered back then in 1999-2000 because I was only about 6-7 years old back then and my computer back then had Windows 95 and was really slow. I recommend this for people who like video games in their entertainment and I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes old classic video games and comedy."" Except the only problem I have with this is that amazon.com is charging you $[...] for this. Go to [...] and get it $[...] cheaper."
5,Awesome!,"I'm not kidding when I say I think all 14 tracks on the album are superb, and I can't stop listening to it. He is so creative with his melodies, so intricate and so not afraid to explore - unlike 99 percent of today's market-driven, poll-tested corporate [bull] passing as music today.If this album doesn't win a Grammy of some kind, there is no justice."
4,excellent,a great followup to hour of B. I like the new direction but for diehards of the first album you might want to check out Ordinary Time by Bill Ricchini which is amazing.
2,After THOBB - disappointing,"The Hour of Bewilderbeast was awesome. Simply awesome. Unfortunately, this follow-up is very disappointing. It's boppy and poppy but has none of the catchiness or 'feel' of his earlier stuff. Make sure you listen to the tracks before you spend your money. :("
2,Borderline boring,"2 1/2Much weaker then his first release, HYFTF suffers from typical arrangement bloat (assimilated more smoothly with his superior soundtrack release of About a Boy that same year) and some embarrassing artistic derivations which keep the album at the bay of boredom."
2,This is genius?,"I gave this a listen based on the other reviews here, many ascribing varying degrees of genuis to it. Maybe it's incredible for the indie category but then many progressive rock bands took music way above this level and that was back in the 70s. I'm getting a bit weary of people placing new, so called special groups, alongside the Beatles like the editor here did, but then he placed Oasis up there as well. There's the occasionally interesting bits here but I wouldn't want to hear this again."
5,Well Fed Fish,"After the blazing start Badly Drawn Boy made with the debut The Hour of Bewilderbeast album, I reckoned he would be hard pushed to top it. Discounting the ABout a Boy soundtrack (although it is, in my view, an excellent album in its own right, there is no doubt that it is lead to a significant extent by the storyline of the book and film), I have to say that I think the direction taken by the second real album is an absolute triumph. There isn't a duffer among them and the perceptive lyrics accompanied by and melodies, yes, you heard it MELODIES, put it in my top 10 albums of the last year or so."
2,Too much noise,"I bought this cd because I believed it would be a fine follow-up to Hour of the Bewilderbeast which is one of my top 10 cds ever in a Beatles White sort of way. What a disappointment. Try as I may, despite repeated playings, I remain bewildered and disappointed.There is no cohesion or direction...just a cacophony of quirky tunes with strings assorted horns and piano that never really settles down. A jumble of too much going on. Strange that in the last couple of weeks Iv'e been listening to Todd Rudgren's Wizard a True Star which I find oddly similar in composition and style, but which I never seem to tire of. Ah well...the lesson learned is listen before you buy."
3,sadly mistaken,"I'm very disappointed in this album. ""About a Boy"" was a small step down from ""...Bewilderbeast"" but this is at least a few big steps down in quality. I miss his lost love, lost summer lyrics and compelling, complicated acoustic melodies.All that beauty has been replaced by huge horn sections, choirs, and distracting arrangements layered over mediocre lyrics. It's simply overproduced. There's way too much going on here. Still, BDB is one of the best singer-songwriters out there and I respect his talent a great deal. I just hope he doesn't contine down the path he's started with this album."
3,This Is A Good Tape But Now That The Complete First Season Is Out I Think That Is Better!,"Nancy Drew was one of my favorite TV shows when I was a young girl in the 70's. Based on the mystery books for young readers by Carolyn Keene it is about a teenager named Nancy Drew who has a knack for solving mysteries and crimes and stars Pamela Sue Martin (Dynasty) as Nancy. The Secret of the Whispering Walls is my favorite episode and is about Nancy's two elderly aunts who live in an old mansion where some strange events are happening and Nancy with the help of her friends, a boy named Ned and a girl named George investigates. Nancy Drew is now finally available on DVD along with the Hardy Boys in the complete first season of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries and as good as this tape is I think it is better to get that complete first season DVD instead. They actually combinded episodes of The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew and alternared each week but unfortunately they later dropped the Nancy Drew epsiodes."
4,She's got everything she needs...,"Rosemary Feit Covey mixes her decadent sensibility and technical proficiency into wood engravings that are wonderful to see. Imagine the latest work covered in the book: a girl in socks buries her doll tenderly; her sister is nearby in the foreground, tied with enormous ropes to the tree. Two fairies run off through the forest towards the marshland as the full moon rises and the birds take flight. The book suffers from a slightly washed out look, but is otherwise competently done."
5,Let's talk about Political Porn,"i saw this film in Greece, and i'm sure that the American version is probably a little softer than the Europeon (original cut). But i'm not too sure. This film is fantastic! i cant stress that enough. the cinematagraphy... and just the overall satirical and witty premise of the film is worth watching. I think im going to make a t-shirt that says: ""Masturbation is Counter-Revolutionary!"" This movie is so smart..."
1,really really bad,"Has to be among the worst movies I've ever watched. Perhaps I just didn't get it. Sophmoric would be several steps up. Terrible acting, ridiculous premise and overall bad filmmaking don't help."
3,Waste of my time and money,"The artwork is good for making paperdolls, perhaps. The coverage of helmets is one example of the limited use for this book. It mentions only 3 types of helmets, (even though there are many more dated to this period), and only shows decent photos of one type, (see the cover). The continual repetition of how lorica hamata was useless against most period weapons goes in the face of the fact that it was sought after by the soldiers and worn in battle. Maybe the modern ""butted chain"" is useless against stabbing and arrows, but riveted and punched chain is not, (modern anachronism like this abound in this book). Save your money and get the Osprey books. I was very disappointed by this one. If you want a better investment, try Southern and Dixon's book ""The Late Roman Army"" here at Amazon. (ISBN: 0300068433)"
3,"Roman Infantry Equipment ""the Later Empire"" not worth the $","The research is very focused and misses many items in the same plane of study. The focus on only three types of Infantry helmets, the idea that hamata was easily penetrated by arrows, and other limiting concepts are weaknesses in the work, as are the various color drawings of period soldiers. Many anachronistic quotes and examples also keep this from being a work worth spending a great deal of money on, unless you wish to have a complete library of the genre. This is about ISBN 0-7524-1908-0 which may not be the same one listed by Amazon at this time. It was published in 1999 and 2001.There aren't many better works available, but an Osprey book will be almost as good, with a lot less fluff and expense."
1,Oh well....,"I purchased the TuneJuice with the hope that it would give my fifth generation iPod a few extra hours for me to watch video. Suffice to say, it doesn't work. The TuneJuice gave me fifteen minutes or so of extra battery time. I should've known it was too cheap to be any good. My advice: get one of the more expensive battery packs--they probably work better."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"It will work for a few minutes on my iPod 40GB, then everything freezes until I disconnect it. I've tried 5 of these on 2 different iPods, and the results are the same every time. Don't waist your money, as I did. If I could rate this product lower than 1, I would."
1,didn't work,"The TuneJuice looks very nice, but it worked for around ten minutes before completely failing. I'll now try to go buy the more expensive models, sigh..."
1,Griffin Tech iPod battery back-up,"This is a terrible product. The first back-up I purchased had to be returned because of really crummy workmanship. Now, the second replacement backup has also broken and I need to send it back to Amazon. I would not recommend this battery backup to anyone and think Amazon should stop selling them to unsuspecting people."
3,Poor quality,"i bought this product to use on a trip so i can listen to my ipod because i don't have a portable laptop or any other sort of charger for itit worked great for about two weekshow it works is that when u put in a fresh battery, it will automatically use it, and the batter meter will look as if it is fullbut once the battery runs out, the battery meter returns to it's normal stateso for example, the battery meter is at half, you plug it in, and then it appears to be full, but once the battery in the tunejuice dies, the battery meter returns to half againafter the two weeks, the thing started to fall apart.one of the wires which connect the battery to the case, broke offand the shell for the plug which connected the ipod to the case, also fell offthe shell clicked back on, but the wire, is still broken"
4,Humor is worth a lot,"So, I can't say that this is the best language learning program that I've ever used....but it's got to be the most creative. Very good for some laughs. I'll probably remember a lot of it just because it's VERY different. As one who has had the use of 2 other Italian programs plus 2 semesters of Italian in the classroom - I can't say that this is a very thorough method, nor is the pronunciation very easy to understand on some of the presenters. Having said that though, this is the cd program that I will have my husband listen to. He will likely remember a few words here and there because of the approach and he has no desire to have an in-depth understanding."
1,Very light reading about two powerful men.,"I had hoped this would be an in-depth exploration ofthe inner workings and motivations of Presidents Trumanand ""Ike"" -what I discovered was a poorly researched, boringbook. It's almost as if Mr. Neal assumed putting bothnames on the book's cover would make it a seller. Buyerbeware. You can find more in-depth material on thesemen and their times right here on the internet. Also,it turns out, Mr. Neal received monies from a TrumanFoundation, which is a poor ethical choice on his part, inpresenting a history that the reader assumes is unbiased.If you like to see pictures of ""Harry & Ike"" -many whichhave been printed elsewhere, you may enjoy ""Harry & Ike""the book. Quite a letdown as to what I expected."
5,Easy Clean-up,"I love these cutting sheets. Not only are they sanitary, I just toss them out after use. So Easy, So Clean! My local stores stopped carrying them...I panicked, so glad I found them here on Amazon."
2,"""POLITICAL"" HORROR MOVIE?","GOOD ACTING. GOOD HORROR SCENES. BAD SCRIPT. I UNDERSTAND THE STEREOTYPICAL PREMISE OF ""STUPID SELFISH TEENS THAT DESERVE TO DIE"" AND ""GREEDY SELFISH ADULTS THAT DESERVE TO DIE"" AS JSTIFICATION FOR THE VIEWER ENJOYING THE MAYHEM. HOWEVER, THIS MOVIE ATTEMPTS TO ADD THE THEMES ""PRESIDRNT BUSH-LOVING TEENS"" DESERVE TO DIE AND FORMER DOPE-HEAD FUN-LIVING TEENS WHO ""SOLD OUT"", AS LEIGHTON MEESTER'S CHARACTER PUTS IT, TO BECOME UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS ADULTS DESERVE TO DIE. THERE IS EVEN THE IMPLICATION THAT SINCE THE MOVIE IS SET IN MOSTLEY REPUBLICAN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE DESERVES TO DIE.I GUESS THEY WANTED TO MAKE A ""SERIOUS"" SLASHER MOVIE.GIVE ME MORE ACTION AND SUSPENSE AND LESS POLITICAL PONTIFICATION."
3,NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET MEETS KILLER KLOWNS,"The teens at an Orange Co. HS are being murdered one by one by a killer clown named ""Horny"" and not because they are having sex. Mackenzie gets cryptic messages as to the next victim, on her Ouija board, 8 ball, Etch-a-Sketch etc.It seems all the parents of the teens who are killed know each other and share a secret. Shades of Elm Street! This is a slasher movie, and we know in the first scene, the clown did it. If you love killer clown movies (and who doesn't) you might add this to your viewing list.F-bomb, sex?, no nudity"
1,Hungry for a bad movie?,"The only A+ in this film is the blood & gore but it fails to help the film in the long run. The Evil Clown's puns & jokes are almost as bad as Mr.Freeze's ice puns from Batman & Robin. Almost! Infact the clown looks like a rejected member of the Killer Clowns from Outer Space or a cheap verison of the clown from IT. The film is mostly boring with little to no jump scares. The cast is forgettable,bland and simi-likeable. The plot rips off mostly from Nightmare on Elm Street but makes less sense here. It fails to be funny,scary and even serious. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Seriously? No Joke,"Wow, just wow. Low budget and seriously bad acting. Even the kills are lame. I cannot see recommending this to anyone. Just an obnoxious film. Look, I get the puns and spoof angle, but it's still a complete waste of time."
1,Stay Away - unless you think wearing pants around your knees is fashionable,"Stupid. This is quasi comedic horror for the demographic that is responsible for turning prison lifestyles into common fashion, despite its unavoidable inefficiency - and how funny is it to watch these guys constantly having to pull up their pants?"
4,Watch it for Leighton..,"Leighton Meester is really the only reason to see this movie. Can she get any hotter? The plot is cheesy but if you like B horror flicks you'll probably like this. But seriously.. if you're a fan of Leighton (Savannah from 'Surface'), you owe it to yourself to see this."
3,"Much potential, little deliverance","The synopsis was pretty good and I'm a fan of slasher movies, so this seemed like something I'd like. Eh....it was oooooook. It could have been a lot better though. I'd say, if you're looking to pick this one up it's iffy so don't pay more than like 5.00 for it, that way you don't feel like you've lost out too much if you end up hating it."
4,Debt Dilemma Eye Opener,"If you are ready to really look at your finances and be challenged to change, then this book is for you. Dr. Taffy addresses real issues, in a real way, that makes you really think about your financial situation. I highly recommend this book to those who are dating or considering dating or engaged because you should always have an open line of communication about finances. It will help you discuss your finances as a couple. Thanks Dr. Taffy for sharing from your life, your love, and your financial story through conquering debt."
5,Acoustic Hedging,"Anybody who misses Michael Hedges, should keep their ear turned to this fellow. Only Peter Mayer's music (especially his live performances) has made me think of Hedges in this way. But Kotaro Oshio's music is even more like Hedges--though less mature than Mayer's at this point. Oshio's passion is abundant in driven acoustic pieces like ""Hard Rain."" The harmonic percussion style of acoustic guitar remains alive in Kotaro Oshio."
5,"Acoustic guitar lovers, buckle your seat belts!","Oshio is my current favorite solo acoustic guitar player. He has the rare combination of dazzlingly fast, crisp technique and deep sense of poetic melody and phrasing. What I mean is, though he can play the pants off any tune, the technique is always in service of the music.His music is very listenable and the range of original and cover tunes he chooses is as fresh as his ear for a beautifully turned phrase."
4,SNAPPY PRE-CODE COMEDY.,"A cinema usher turns to crime, flees to Hollywood and becomes a movie player: a hectic slam-bang action comedy with melodratic moments. Great fun. Cagney play Dan Quigley, a man who finds he's been the victim of a confidence set-up. Dan threatens the gang with exposure unless they cut him in on the profits. Quigley works the racket so well, they are able to open a swank gambling club which is patronised by wealthy customers. Eventually the cops suspect illicit dealings and the gang leave town en route to Los Angeles, where Dan gets arrested. Because there isn't enough evidence in order to hold him, the police release Quigley. Looking like a hobo, he's hired for work as a movie extra...A thoroughly enjoyable thirties spoof of gangsters and Hollywood, in this one poor Mae Clarke is pulled by Jimmy - by him grabbing her hair! The original working title for the film was THE FINGER MAN..."
3,Classic Cagney romp.,"The young con gets conned. And that's how it starts in a crooked card game with femme fatale Mae Clarke setting the bait. You'll remember Mae, she's the same actress who took the grapefruit in the face in 'Public Enemy'.James Cagney is perfect as the street wise punk who joins a gang after they fleece him. The action (and the plot) move along fast enough to keep any viewer interested. True to it's 'pre-code' status, the subject material is adult. There are few innocent people here. Cagney stays with the gang pulling several 'jobs' until a bystander is killed.In Hollywood, the gang betrays him again and leaves for Mexico with Jimmy's money. Gagney joins a motion picture studio working as an extra. He soon rises to stardom with Margaret Lindsey as his new flame. The gang returns to blackmail him but Jimmy gets them in the end. Plenty of pre-code fun. Jimmy and Mae mix it up again with Jimmy doing the rough stuff. I would recommend this film to Jimmy Cagney fans and pre-code fans."
3,Pre-Code Cagney,"An episodic comedy-drama, ""Lady Killer"" (1933) gives James Cagney plenty of room to strut his stuff. Despite the obvious plot contrivances, Cagney makes this slick pre-Code romp worth watching. Reliable support from Mae Clarke, Margaret Lindsay and Douglass Dumbrille. Though lacking the stature of Cagney's finest vehicles, the movie succeeds as a fast-paced Warner Bros. programmer."
5,An all-time favorite classic,"Charlie Brown holiday classics are some of my favorite shows. I always enjoy them whenever I can view them, either online or on the slowly going old tv."
5,Fast shipping,"Well packaged, love this movie and always miss it on TV during Halloween so finally bought my own copy. Works great, packaged well, cheap, and has a few other cartoon shorts included."
3,No different from the SD version,"I really like watching this with my three year old son. He gets the same enjoyment out of it as I did as a kid. This is a classic for sure. But, I see very little difference in this Blu ray from the Standard version. I was expecting better clarity from this new Blu ray version and it's just not there. Seems like another way to make someone else rich."
4,what a pumpkin,They just don't make them like this anymore. There is a reason this is a classic. Do yourself and your kids a favor and watch these together. That would certainly be quality time.
5,"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown",We have enjoyed this very much! Our 4 year old grandson has watched it nearly every day since it arrived!! It's the perfect length for a child--he doesn't get antsy before it is over.
5,It's not halloween without the Great Pumpkin,"This movie has and always will be in my mind the best family halloween movie! I remember when I was very little everytime we went pumpkin picking asking my mother if the pumpkin patch was sincere (giggle). Now I watch this with my kids. their little now, but i hope they cherish this throughout there lives as much as I have!"
3,What's up with the AD's on DVDs?,"I hate DVDs that have ads on the fron that you can skip. This one has a scary scene from the Wizard of Oz that frieghtens my 3 year old when you put it on. I mean, who is the genius that thought ""Hey Let's put a scary scene on this disc as soon as you put it in, and lets MAKE people watch it"". WTF???1 star for the DVD.10 stars for the film!"
5,Classic!,"Classic Charlie Brown what else can you say. Also included more than just the ""It's the Great Pumplkin Charlie Brown"" movie."
5,It's almost like I am a kid again,"Very few things bring out the kid in me and this is one of them. I grew up waiting for CBS to broadcast this every year and always checked the schedule at least a week in advance. Now, my children love the movie and think I am strange for also loving the movie. It is sweet and kind, compared to today's cartoons which are frequently coarse.I have many of the Charlie Brown movies and am amazed at their popularity with kids today. This movie is one of Schultz's best."
5,"It's the Great Pumkin, Charlie Brown [VHS]","Great tape, came quickly works great. This was a Christmas present for my little sister in 2009 and she loves it, it works great then and now. She still watches it. The vcr stopped working, but the tape still plays great in the new vcr. I also ordered several other Charlie Brown tapes and they are all great. I recommend this seller and would buy from again."
2,times have changed,"I just bought this for my 4-year old, based on the warm, fuzzy memories I have of it from when I was a child. What I found: Linus and Charlie Brown are regularly mocked, belittled, and called stupid; and Snoopy pretends he's a WWII ace complete with incoming machine gun fire and (if I'm not mistaken) the sound of bombs in the distance. Not recommended for children unacquainted with the cruelty of aerial combat and relentless teasing."
3,It's ok..,"I expected this to be a bit more sturdy and feel that over time, it will stretch and pulll off the wheel. Expected better for the price."
2,Poor quality,"Good looking , easy to use , fair price....poor quality , failed after 3 month , it costs me to much to send it back - so it is in the junk"
1,"Ready, Set, Going Back!","This book was such a disappointment that I returned it. The idea of book and wind up toy is wonderful, and I purchased it thinking that it would be cute like the Motor Book version of ""The Little Blue Engine that Could"" but ""Ready, Set, Go"" has NO story, and the illustrations are not good enough to compensate. Spend your money on toys and books and not on this gimicky in-between."
3,"Summarizes FDA rules, but does not discuss them","I bought the book based on only one review, but was a bit disappointed. It did indeed list all relevant code, and referenced it for further study, but the codes themselves are hardly self-explanatory. Except for some introductory comments, there was very little in the way of further explanation on the topics in this book.I was looking for some interpretation, examples, what is typically done in the real world to meet requirements, etc.It's a good reference book, but just a starting point in understanding what is necessary to satisfy the FDA in medical device manufacturing. Buy it used if possible, you won't be using it much except for reference."
4,the FDA BOOK,"come on time, work well so far, very happy, happy happy happy happyhappy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy.Thanks"
2,Review,"This book contains the germ of a good idea - to follow the adventures of four medical students during their gross anatomy class. The medical information contained in the book is most interesting.However, the clunky, pedantic style of the writing together with the many unexplained technical terms used (sometimes erroneously), make reading this book a tiring experience. The author clearly needs more editorial assistance and creative writing experience in order to lighten the tone of the book and to make it less boring. Right now it is about as exciting to read as a trust deed for an irregularly shaped piece of farmland."
4,Progressive trends,"Jordan is a small Middle Eastern country buffetted by events outside its control. The formation of Israel in 1948 and the migration of many Palestinians to Jordan at the start of this time period was perhaps the most significant of all the demographic events.Winckler studies this and other trends, drawing upon official government data and other research.The book also describes how the rise of the Arab oil states siphoned off many Jordanians. The industrialisation of Jordan and the increasing level of universal education are also studied. The reader will find many tables of statistics, that buttress the author's findings. One key feature was the attention and resources paid to educating women, and the ready availability of contraceptives. A tribute to the progressive nature of the government, which, while not democratic, lacked the bloodthirsty nature of its Syrian and Iraqi neighours, or the repressive theocracy of the Saudis."
2,Looks like whiteout,"I actually purchased this item at the BMW dealership for only $25, and to be honest it's not that great. It looks like I just tried to cover the scratches with whiteout. It looks terrible and worse than before. I thought that the colors would actually somehow blend together because it was the actual BMW paint, but I was wrong..."
3,Other paintings are better,"This coaster comes in 2 paintings, this is one and the other one I dont remember the name of. Anyways they are only 2 editions so you cant go wrong. The other edition printing and quality is outstanding, i'd give it a 5/5. This one, the printing is poor, it makes you feel the painting not clear. I never serve it to guests, I use the other one.PS thomas Kinkade is my favourite artist so it takes a lot of courage of me to say that!"
3,Item was broken,Two of them were broken when arrived so I had to send them back for a refund. The picture was nice but did not get to keep them.
3,Problem with the parallel port #1,"When I use port # 1 and # 2 simultaneously printer server freezes, I had to use printers connected on port # 2 and # 3."
2,At first taste is good...,I was looking for a beef jerky with 0 sugars and organic I found both in this product and good taste but after you eat it there is a not so pleaent after effect of like a film in your mouth and I did not know this when I ordered but it's not as lean as I need it to be I needed a beef jerky that is atleast 97% lean.... I will keep looking but want order so much at one time again...
4,Great snack!,"This is a great snack for kids! My son has multiple dietary restrictions and can not have many of the ingredients in more ""main stream"" beef jerky. This is a great natural product. It has a nice flavor and is not spicy."
3,Trial,"I'm curious about the claim that coconut use fights candida, when other diets that decrease the carbs are suppose to also help in aiding fighting off candida since it feeds off of carbs? Is it the coconut or the decrease in carbs? A simple decrease in carbs is also a fat fighter so I'm a little confused as to which one is the primary one at work here. We have purchased coconut oil in the past, but not used it for this reason. I would like to try the ""The Coconut Diet"" book but am a little curious about these ingredients and what the order is as to what is actually fighting fat and candida first, coconut or low carb? Any answers?"
3,love the coconut,I look forward to trying some of the recipes. The couple that I did try did not give me the best results but I'm still going to try them.
2,first buy on amazon.com coconut diet book,"coconut diet book was okay it didn't give me exactly what i was looking for about the coconut diet my friend had told me about...it has good information in it as to eating habits, the health tidbits about coconut oil, i ordered all the coconut oil..coconut manna...dry flaked unsweeten coconut, palm sugar...etc because of the infor in the book..coconut water always is so refreshing after i finish at the gym and on hot days"
1,road to high cholesterol,"My wife tried adding coconut oil to her diet, and in 2 months her cholesterol was up over 40 points from a good 157 to 200, weight stayed the same. Use at your own risk. A good thing she did her cardio at the same time, or it might have been higher !"
3,the recipes in ebook form can't be read,I bought this book for my kindle and the recipes can't be read because the fractions of 1\2 tsp etc. are H tsp or G tsp or G cups. I bought another eBook from eBook library and it came down the same way.the contents do not list any recipes and they are hard to find in eBook format. I love the information in this book and would love to make the recipes they sound good. if anyone else has solved this problem let me know please.I googled the ASCII conversion table but it didn't help.I also tried to contact the book publisher and the author but was unable to. I am left with trying to decipher the code myself.The Coconut Diet: The Secret Ingredient That Helps You Lose Weight While You Eat Your Favorite Foods
3,Good Book,"This book is good, but I wish the author had limited the recipes and created shopping lists for each week--I bought way too much produce and seemed to spend too much time in the kitchen. I'm unemployed so I have the time, but if I was working 40 hours per week, I couldn't do this diet. I went off the diet after 7 days, because I was getting a headache from not eating any carbs."
2,The Coconut Diet,The Coconut Diet:i didnt find this book to offer any new information it just repeats well known nutritional fact
5,Book of Prayers,I have been a practicing hypnotherapist for 15 years.I find this book to be a glorious prayerful addition to my use of language during sessions. I will often tear out a page and take it with me somewhere- and then utilize a phrase or a concept.The integrating nature of the wrap up of a session is lovely. I recommend the in person course as well!
2,Not my cup of tea,"I was hoping and excited to have a book that relates to my philosophy in life and use it in therapy as well. Unfortunately due to the choppy style of writing, I could not get immersed into this book. If you are looking for a hypnosis manual, I would recommend Professional Hypnotism Manual by John Kappas or Monsters and Magical Sticks: THere is No Such Thing As Hypnosis by Steven Heller."
2,Almost unreadable,"This was very badly written and incoherent. Bit of a dogs breakfast really. Maybe tried to include too much. I struggled with it and I am a practitioner.So many abstractions - maybe the point was to read it in trance haha. In which case it fulfils its purpose. But if you want to make any of it conscious, good luck.Couple of good basic relaxation scripts, but overall a disappointment."
4,A must for Metallica fans -- Everyone else shouldn't bother,"This Metallica DVD chronicles the making of the Black Album through exclusive interviews, archive footage and performances with the band members and producer Bob Rock. Most of the archive footage is [taken] from the other videos tapes, but there are some new items in there with the band almost 10 years after the fact.If you are a Metallica fan, you'll want to own this DVD. If you are not, don't waste your money."
2,Its a repeat,"This dvd is just another excuse to make money. It has all of the same footage that was on a year and a half of metallica and the stuff i've seen on VH1. My reccomendation is to buy a year and a half of metallica. It has all the footage from this dvd, plus what they did on the road after the album was released. AND IT HAS MUSIC VIDEOS all of the one from the black album plus live stuff. this one was just a reason to disappoint fans who alread bought a year and a half."
3,"a good one, but it could've been a lot better","first of all i wanna say that i think it would be really better if metallica had produced this dvd. but they didn't, so lets start.they could've added the videos. i mean all the videos, the divide the dvd in 7 chapters: enter sandman, sad but true, holier than thou, the unforgiven, wherever i may roam, nothing else matters, and the end credits. and they should have added the video of each song.well actually that's it. the another things of the dvd are great. the band around the console, the demos, the stories, all that stuff is great. and its also great when they play again enter sandman, like recording again, but you hear the different style and the different voices, and that's really great"
3,"Good, but a bit dull","I bought this video expecting it to have the videos to all the Black Album singles, but nope, just a documentary on the album. It's still a good video however, some good coverage on all the songs, and plenty of footage of them in the studios. But like I said, it's just, kinda dull. It could've been a little more interesting, and I wish it could've included the videos to all the songs on there. So in the end, if you're a HUGE Metallica fan looking for a GOOD video, eh, you might not wanna try this."
2,Replay factor zero,For metallica fans it may be a source of a whole lot of new information but in the end when you have seen it once maybe twice there is nothing to go back to it for. Its basically a set of interviews with short clips of the five singles in the background.
2,An interveiw only,"This is strictly an interview with metalica,It is not a music video so dont be fooled by the cover.I bought it and got screwed."
1,THIS AIN'T WORTH THE $$$$$,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE GOOD.BOY, WAS I WRONG I AM A DIE HARD METALLICA FAN.THEY DON'T NEED TO REPEAT THE SAME VIDEOS OF INTERVIEWS.I WILL KEEP IT SINCE I HAVE IT. I COULD DO BETTER WITHTHE VIDEOS I HAVE.I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE MAKING OF THE ALBUM AND THEN THE VIDEOS. A YEAR AND HALF WAS MUCH BETTER.IF YOU CAN DON'T BUY THIS. IT [stinks]"
3,Missing glossary and exercises,"I bought this book for the Brooklyn College online technical writing program, as a required text.Just beware that this is the ""basic"" version. Not only is it missing the exercises, which are provided as part of the online course, but it is also missing the glossary, which is where the reading assignments are. Ask the instructor to send you the link to the online glossary."
4,Style,It was in good shape with no bent edges or ripped pages. There was also no writing and overall I was pleased with the quality and how quickly it was shipped.
4,Style,"Condition of the book is amazing! Only negative is that the word ""USED"" appears too many times on the cover of the book! I think that even just ONE ""used"" on the cover that I would understand that the book was used."
4,Laurel Burch cat plate,The plate that I ordered was a replacement. I had the same plate before but I knocked it off the wall and broke it. It's part of a set of 4.
5,Realize the Beauty,"""I tell you now that there are moments in this life when a truth comes that the heart has known all along. At these moments there is a deep silence, a sound at the center of the world like a drumming. I knew what he said was true. The Voice had spoken it to me, but I had shut the camber of my heart. I was speechless before the old man."" (P 58-59)A beautiful tale. Such a tale as bends the heart to realize the beauty. Legend and historical fact is wedded in such a luminous, unforgettable way, playing upon the urges, struggles and desires of the common man who longs to lead a strong, noble, godly and joyous life. Juilene paints men as they are but also as they *could be*. This is storytelling at its finest. An adult read of great quality and inspiration. O, to tell the stories of God, as Osian told his tales!"
5,Padraig of Eire,"Not having read the jacket, and not already knowing any of the legend surrounding St. Patrick, I didn't even realize it was about him until I read the notes at the end. That made it extra-interesting, but the story stood powerfully on its own.I wasn't upset by anything except the part with Crom Cruach; that jolted me out of suspension of disbelief long enough to wonder whether (... had better not include spoilers). In general, the things I could have been offended by seemed reasonable and well-crafted. An agnostic (full disclosure), I liked how the theology was inclusive of Christianity and druids and sidhe. I'm particularly satisfied with the richness of the main characters (though the supporting cast are rather 2-dimensional), considering how little the author had from which to extrapolate their personalities.I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in Irish history, culture, and mythology; it educates a little while entertaining a lot."
4,Bridging two worlds...,"At sixteen Patrick is kidnapped by Irishmen from his home in post-Roman Britain and sold into slavery, where he is treated cruelly and nearly broken in spirit by his owner. Yet he manages to escape back to his homeland.The novel opens with a mature, forty year-old Patrick sent back to Ireland, the country of his enslavement, with the mission to convert the people of Eire to Christianity. But Patrick is not at peace with himself. He is driven by bitterness, anger, and insecurity. It is only through his growing friendship with the Irish bard, Osian, who has come from the Otherworld to help Patrick, and through his tales of his legendary Fenian father, Finn Mac Cool, that Patrick might be able to make peace with his past. This is also a novel about Ireland's Druidic past: their sage beliefs and customs, and their bonds with earth and spirit. It is where past and present blend and begin to become one in this mystical and romantic historical fantasy of ancient Ireland."
4,Magical.,"This is a novel of Ireland and two of its greatest legends. Patrick, the man who became a Saint, and Osian, poet and warrior.. Osian is called from the past by magic by the former slave turned Monk who brings Christianity to Ireland. Osian, who hates is fellowman now is to fulfill his destiny. But before he can do that, he must learn confront his own demons and open his heart. An historical combined with a bit of fantasy to form the stuff of legends. Well researched and well written, I Am of Irelaunde offers insights into the men who, because of their very existence, laid the foundations of Ireland what it is today. Congratulations, Juliene Osborne-McKnight for an insightful read."
1,Does not fit,"The charger did not fit into my 2003 Volvo. However, it did fit into my friend's 2005 Volvo."
1,"Missing ""History""","Purchasers should be warned that ""A History of Britain III""is less than promised. This two-tape collection is missingone of its parts. While tape one (Volume VII) is complete,with ""Forces of Nature"" and ""Victoria and Her Sisters,""tape two (Volume VIII) only contains ""The Two Winstons,""without the section titles ""Empire of Good Intentions.""Do not purchase this set until The History Channel cancorrect this serious error."
1,a very big disappointment,"I bought the first two volumes and then happened to see the third in the library, so I checked it out. What a disappointment!! Not only was ""Empire of Good Intentions"" missing, as others have noted, but in this third volume Mr. Schama has gone off on a tangent and apparently forgotten this is supposed to be a history of Britain, NOT a sociological review of all that was bad in the last two centuries of Britain's history. I enjoyed learning the history of Britain in the first two, but somehow, what was actually happening in Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries was subservient to Mr. Schama's liberal take on everything. I am certainly glad I did not buy volume three. It pales in comparison to the first two."
1,Incomplete set,"I am seconding the comments by Joseph Miller (no relation). Some time ago, I telephoned Britannia and told the operator that I had received 2 volumes, not 3, and the segment on the disintegration of the Empire was missing. (This was shown in its complete format on a TV program on the History Channel, so I know whereof I speak.)"
2,Anyone have a resolution?,I'm in the same boat as other reviewers - would have rated the third part of the series much higher - but one segment was missing. Has anyone received any sort of resolution from the History Channel?
2,cleans well but still to harsh,"They used to have an old formula I believe it did not have any drying acylic acid (wrong spelling) or whatever it is that they put in there, then they changed it... well this stuff sucks if you have sensitive skin, it will just make you get more oily & make your face red. I don't understand how or why you would change something that works, I only gave it two stars because it cleans well... to bad it strips the crap out of your skin!!"
1,mistake,"This editorial review for the band House of Shakira does not match the customer review, for the Columbian singer Shakira. This could be confusing to customers."
5,Great for Homeopaths,I had a previous copy of this little dictionary which finally fell apart on me and I use it all the time. Since it is a very old version it has most of the words used in the Materia Medicas and Repertories that one might want to look up. Much better than having to search on the internet or trying to look up in Medical Dictionaries. Highly recommended.
4,Lamisil May Work Better For You,"A semi-athletic friend of mine who frequents the ""Y"" tells me that Lamisil works better than this medication. While Lamisil costs a bit more, it worked better on the most stubborn areas, such as the bottom of his foot. Lotrimin seems to take longer as well. Usually, we talk about more interesting things, but he wanted to get the word out.Ingredient Comparison.Lotrimin: Clotrimazole (1%) (Antifungal). Inactive Ingredients: Benzyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Esters Wax, Octyldodecanol, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Monostearate, Water.Lamisil: Terbinafine Hydrochloride Cream 1%, Benzyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetyl Palmitate, Isopropyl Myristate, Polysorbate 60, Purified Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitan Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol."
4,Coleman insulated sport bottle,"good item, keeps liquid cold, adjustable strap. I added a pad from a back pack to make it more comfortable on my shoulder. Only drawback is the 64oz capacity makes it heavy on long hikes, like carrying a 2 liter bottle around. I recommend filling it 1/2 to 3/4's full only."
4,its allright,I couldnt get the tommie Roe 12 in a Row dis I wanted- which has all the songs I wanted on it- but this is allright- He does a pretty good job on crimson and clover and Sugar sugar is allright but it doesnt have the bright bouncyness of the archies
4,Kids In The Hall LIVE ON STAGE!,"Everyone who saw the Kids In The Hall on their 2002 ""Tour Of Duty"" had to be hoping that a home video version of the show would come out - and now here it is! While I can't remember every single sketch the Kids did - in my case, at the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse - rest assured - a lot of classuc characters like Simon Milligan and the Head-Crushing Guy make appearances, as well as a few new sketches written post - 9/11.The cast really responded to the energy of a live show, though on the night I saw them, Kevin McDonald was pretty much voted Kid In The Hall Most Liable To Break Up During A Sketch.This was a very skillfully performed sketch show with terrific, functional screen backdrops and excellent sound. If you loved the KITH live, you'll want to own the DVD or video."
5,An excellent read for anyone with a brain.,"This book is always on loan, my wife & I love it and so does everyone who reads it. The bad guys are really bad and the good guys are really good. This book makes you laugh, cry and THINK.We recommend it!"
4,Funki Porcini can't go wrong,"Funki Porcini has put out some of the most unique sounds with this CD. Taking the listener out of the normal realm of music. This isn't music you just listen to, it invades your senses. This is music you feel. Start to finish."
1,"I almost never give anything 1 star, but...","...this one earned it. If you're looking for some hip, avant-agrde trip-out music 90s style, this STILL isn't what you're looking for.It's a mish-mash of not-strong beats, wack musings on interesting instrumentations, and just plain old bad songwriting. Ambience for ambience's sake isn't refreshing; it no more pushes the envelope of a tired music scene than does record reviews. But this CD is just a little too left-field for any causal listening, and I don't shouldn't have to put my brain too heavy on a CD with so many wack tracks.Nice idea, nice try at being different, but different has never equaled good."
4,A Must Have....,"This might not be Mr. Gillespie at his best, but it is Dizzy, and it is jazz. (And) Dizzy playing jazz (even if it is not one of his better performances) is better than most at their absolute best. Touring is takes a lot out of musicians. Even when you are not performing you still don't get any rest. You have signings and rehearsals you have to attend. At any rate this DVD is great to have because there are some great solos by the other artist performing. Although I feel as if some of them were under used. You will not be disappointed with any aspect of the performances on this DVD."
4,Where do you get your editors for the editorial reviews?,Flora Purim an Afro-Cuban queen? Really? Seems like someone at Amazon editorial is either not really into the music or simply not good at fact-checking. Flora was born in Rio de Janeiro and is best known for Brazilian tinged fusion work.
1,Why doesen't Amazon make a zero star rating? Horrible movie with terrible acting.,"The titles says it all. This movie is one of the worst that I have ever seen. I am 11 years old and don't get scared of Goosebumps but not ready for horror movies and I love scary things so we bought this. Not scary at all! Amazon really needs a zero star rating. I've heard other customers say that too, so Amazon, please make one!"
1,"Okay, you're crazy.","Geez. This reads like another badly written abused gal celebrity whine. Not to dismiss the horror of abuse, but have you noticed the disproportionate number of celebrities with bad daddies and loveless homes who love to talk about it? In print? For money? For publicity? I swear there is a template floating around for these bios. YAWN."
1,This girl is REALLY NUTTS....,"She believes shes going to be the mother of the secondcoming of christ. This book must be a joke, it had me laughing. She sounds like shes joined a cult and she really believes shes a household name . If this book is true she has more issues that we previously thought. Somebody help her..."
1,Call me sceptic,"After watching the Barbara Walters interview I was intigued to find out more about Anne's story. Unfortunately, the book is poorly written and a disappointment. In print, the story seems even more ridiculous. I have to wonder, if she could imagine spaceships while on ectasy, could she have imagined the sexual abuse as well? I am sceptical about her whole story. Her insanity defense seems to wrap up everything quite nicely. Yes I believe she is a good actress but her real talent lies in curing herself of 30 years of mental illness in just one day. The entire book should have been devoted to that feat alone!"
4,an intriguing memoir,"Anne Heche writes an intimate, sad, story of a girl who went through hell. I found it to be poignant, surprising, and sweet. There are a couple of graphic descriptions of events in her life that most people would find a little disturbing.it takes guts to pour out that much of yourself, candidly and honestly, and I reccommend this book just simply to hear about the world someone else has had to endure."
5,Life narrative,"I once had a professor in college who spoke to my class about the importance of knowing your own life narrative. I grow scared of this notion because there are parts of my life I have difficult integrating into my narrative, especially early childhood events related to sexual abuse. What Anne Heche has done here is increadibly brave. She has presented her whole life narrative. Whether it is intended for a large readership I don't care. There are some out there who will find strength in her courage. She is to be commended."
2,Was a little hard to follow her writing at times.,"I like her as an actress better then a writer. She was to all over the place, hard to follow her story."
5,Buy this Book NOW!,"If you're looking for well formed writing, no this book is not for you. If you're looking for Anne Heche to present herself as some amazing woman without problems, then stay away BUT if you want a very entertaining read about one of Hollywood's least celebrated, interesting people then BUY it!I absolutely adore this book. Some say it is far fetched and couldn't be true but I love that Anne Heche really opened herself up to this project of writing a memoir. There is nothing worse than reading a ""guarded"" autobiography and this is as far from that as you can get.From incest, to LSD therapy to being one of the first openly gay ladies of Hollywood...and then changing her mind this book never has a dull moment."
1,"Flighty, wispy, and insignificant","Having just finished reading this book, I was terribly disappointed. I saw her interview with Barbara Walters which I found intriguing and interesting; at least interesting enough to pick up her book and read it through. However, as I kept turning the pages waiting for something concrete, revealing (as this IS a memoir), or at least as charismatic as the writer is in person, I reached the last page realizing I had read in vain. This book is self-indulgent. It is written as if the writer's mind was a cockroach haphazardly typing on a keyboard, and most wretched of all, not in the least bit engaging as its author is in real life."
1,Call me Crazy,I feel this was the worst written book I have ever read. It jumped around. It was not clear of what the author was intended for her audience to see. My suggestion is to borrow it from a friend or from the libray-save your money!!!!
3,Intense book!,"This memoir was intense, it's hard to beleived that a person can go threw this and survive, Anne is a sensitive, beautiful and talented actresse, it take lots of courage to write that type of book and I think people who said she just want publicity they the one who are truely crazy, come on will someone write these type of things for publicity, I beleive they are narrow, cruel and selfish people who said that. It was a good book but something was missing, the writing maybe is not that good, we tent to want to give up reading but if you are a fan of Anne Heche or just want to know about this wonderful person and how she survive threw her abuse has a child read it."
2,"Yes, I would call her crazy","The best thing about this book is that Anne speaks so highly of her relationship with Ellen. As for the rest of it, she clearly has some very interesting beliefs (especially, the one where she becomes God for a while), and even though she was never 'officially' diagnosed, I would call her crazy. If the facts of her childhood are correct, she did experience some horrific behavior by both her parents, and I do applaud the fact that she has become an accomplished actress. But, she is a mess, and to read her story is to get the inside view of a very disturbed mind. I ended up feeling sorry for her, and hoping that she (somehow) gets her life together. If you like Hollywood gossip and sordid details of sexual abuse and mental disorders, then this book is for you."
1,WHY BUY THE BOOK?,"Anne the nutball spilled her guts on 20/20, what more is there to say? I have never seen a more ridiculous woman in my life. Think Sally Field's ""You really like me!"" speech stretched out for 40 minutes. This woman is so hungry for publicity (has she been in ANYTHING since the breakup?) she spilled her guts Sally Jesse Raphael-style on TV, complete with eyelash batting, hair flipping and tearing up. Please Anne. Go away now."
1,"""Anne...ya want some cheese with that whine?""","By now we should all be sick and tired of actress/model/pop types who try to identify themselves as victims in one form or another. LIFE IS TOUGH, DEAL WITH IT. Actually this is an OK read if you are really into Anne Heche but I fail to generate any sympathy myself. It would be more interesting as a BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL presentation."
3,Crazy like a fox,"I saw the Barbara Walters interview and now I've read the book and am not sure what to make of either experience. Is Heche truly a victim of abuse, multiple personalities, heartbreak and more or is she a shrewd manipulator able to market herself to a willing public at a time when her career and life are in flux? I'm sure there are those who'll read her book and be inspired by her tale of pain, redemption, hurt and resilience but I have to say I came away with a more skeptical view. I'm sure this book will win her at least 15 minutes of fame and, with luck, even a bit more - a movie deal, appearances on talk shows, etc."
2,Sad Story Badly Told,"This book and an earlier work by Susan(Heche) Bergman are poorly researched and badly written. I viewed them as a complete waste of time. Annes early years were pretty tough and I admire her recovery. However, she comes off as a dull light weight throughout. I do admire her acting particularly in Wag the Dog which was even more convincing in view of her fondesss for Bill Clinton. I am surprised the two never got together. Oh well maybe they did and we can read about it in ''Call Me Crazy II"" Let's hope not."
2,Took Guts to Write this Odd Memoir,"Strangely unsatisfying tell-all. I distinctly felt that the book was more the writer's attempt to heal than a piece of literary work.Heche shares much of her oddball therapy work, self-spun theories of her case, and dredged-up memories of abuse in her utterly messed-up childhood, but strangely enough reveals little of her SELF. I felt I was pushed into the psychiatrist's own chair, not allowed to be merely a reader or (in the best case of autobiography) a kind of temporary confidante and friend.I gotta hand it to her, it took some guts to own up to some of this (psychotic episode under influence of Ecstasy, for one), and I am sorry for her suffering as a child. But perhaps SHE should have paid ME to read her unsavory chunk of insanity."
1,Sad!,"This is a self-serving whine about tragedies that beset one family and offers no sympathy for parents, siblings, or the circumstances which brought them to despair. Unlike her older sister's book (""Anonymity"" by Susan Heche Berman), a painful, poetic, and empathetic re-examination of life lived and distorted by the phenomena of masked homesexuality, untimely death, and the struggle of survivors to overcome, Heche's diabribe brims with venom. It's vile language and unsubstantiated accusations reveal a fatally flawed human being who has achieved fame and fortune, but not inner peace. This is not a book for teens who idolize Hollywood stars; marked by vulgarity and disrepect for the dead and living, it is a sad commentary on Miss Heche and the world she inhabits."
2,Ok quality,For the money you can get a better square from Empire. I might have gotten a bad apple but it wasn't even square and the blade was warped. I would even be tempted to spend the money and get a starret. It's always better to buy good tools first then have to redo a job and waste material.
4,Alphabet Aerobics,"The first 6 tracks are pretty fair, but ""Alphabet Aerobics"" is worth the seven bucks alone. Good stuff."
4,Don't Sleep On This EP...,"Earlier this week Blackalicious dropped ""The Craft"" and I was quick to put in my order for it. However, I just couldn't wait for it to arrive, so I had to pull out some old Blackalicious to hold me over. ""Blazing Arrow"" perhaps? ""Nia""? Nah, I went with ""A2G"" for some reason and I'm glad I did. I'd forgotten how unbelieveably dope this short effort is.Just 7 tracks long, Blackalicious come correct with Chief Xcel producing all but one song. ""A2G"" has got a really soulful vibe backed with slick rhyming and interesting song concepts, especially the EPs last song, ""Alphabet Aerobics"", a song which is worth the price of admission alone. Granted if you haven't copped this album your at least 6 years late, but it's worth it for all Blackalicious fans. If you've to check anything from them, this 1999 release wouldn't be a bad place to start, considering it short enough for you not waste much time over but just long enough to leave you fiending for more."
2,"Basic, or even simplistic.","This book covers a small scope of using worms in row cropping systems. My question was, when buying this book, what to feed the soil to feed the worms, and how to manage my worm population on my market farm. Most of the book was making an effort to convince me that worms are good, and the remainder drew on studies of how not to kill worms in your field."
4,Einar from Sugarcubes plus the Daisy Chainsaw/Queen Adreena gal,"Yes, that's right, 2 of indie rock's most warped voices, together on this outing, only one time ever. Miss it and... well, prolly nothing much."
2,Not impressed!,"While there are several things I liked, the color, the width, the thickness, and the easy to use air nozzles, I was very disappointed in the dual-function capability of this lounge. When lying flat the arms of the lounge get in the way but even that I could work around. However, that is the only way this lounge worked for me. When trying to use as a chaise the connectors constantly came apart, not just for me but for everyone that tried it. There was no choice but to lay flat on it. I'm still looking for that perfect, inexpensive dual-function lounge. This is not it!!!"
3,Good movie.,"This is not considered one of Bud Spencer's best comedies. (Otherwise there'd surely be more editions and releases of it.) I still reckon it is good though, being a fan of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill comedies, including the music. It is also a good example of how American soldiers can misbehave in a foreign country, and thus be disliked.This movie is basically the same story as 'Bomber', a later Bud Spencer comedy. A lot of Hollywood (& Hollywood type) movies have similar stories. I'd say that if getting this movie, also get 'Bomber', for the complete story. One also mustn't confuse this movie with the later Bud Spencer one 'They Call Him Bulldozer', which came out after Bud Spencer stopped acting in comedies."
4,Slow start but worth the effort,"This novel gets off to a slow start. I think the prologue kept me reading. Initially, the author's characterization of Mary Bullitt is unconvincing. Happily, as the character ages, so does the writer's depth in portraying her. Stay with the novel through the first bit, and you'll enjoy the journey. Lots of action and opportunities for speculation about the General's romantic interests."
5,An Awesome Read,"I was hooked from page one. Half way through the book I slowed down, wanting to savor every word. It was unbelievably good. I have just read the final page, and as I closed the book I was in tears. This story moves you. It is an awesome read, one I will be recommending to all my friends."
5,The Good Journey,This was by far the best book I've read in a long time! I absolutely savored this book. Didn't want it to end. My librarian recommended this book to me and I was lukewarm about even starting it. I was so moved by the ending that I cried....and believe me that doesn't happen often.
4,Husker CD Holder,"The elastic straps are tight on my visor, but I drive a FJ Cruiser, so the visors are large. Otherwise, it holds the CDs perfectly and is quite convenient."
5,Very nice,This is an very nice shower curtain. I've been looking for a denim shower curtain and could not find one; I was happy to stumble across this one and ordered it right away. I ordered on 1 Nov and received it on 5 Nov (estimated delivery was 20 Nov). Very nice quality. I like that it is a little longer than a standard shower curtain. Now to find accessories!
2,"A Little Laughter, but Poor Writing Style","Life al Dente has a few amusing moments with heartfelt memories by the author. The predominantly Southern Italian family memories are described directly and crassly, devoid of any flair, descriptive language, or writing style. Foul language accents this poorly written novel. The cover illustration and title are its only redeeming features."
3,Just ok,The vibrations are controlled from the wheel at the bottom. The vibrator is relatively thick and due to the soft material alot of the vibration gets lost between the motor and you. If you are someone that doesn't like intense vibration than this will probably be fine. Otherwise you may want to try something else.
3,not that good,It doesn't deliver the expected level of statisfaction. Now as powerful as it should be for the design and use.
2,Not very powerful,I was imagining that this would be a lot more powerful than it was; also the vibrations are not where they're needed.
3,Doc Johnson Lucid Dream,"this product definately hit the Gspot destination, but the build of the product ended up uncomfortable. i know it needs to be as firm as it is to accure desired pleasure, but i think the middle needs to be not so firm and a little more gerth."
1,Weak product,I was so excited when I found this so cheap on here... the product did arrive earlier than expected but the product itself is sub par. I'm not sure if it's the material it is made from or if it was defective but it had a horrible smell when I removed it from its package. I used toy cleaner and even tried soap but the smell stayed. I decided to see how it worked anyway and put two new batteries in. The vibration was so weak even on the highest speed. I was so sad and disappointed... I wish I could return it but once it's opened that's not possible.
2,Dissatisfied,"I bought this product because of the reviews but I find myself really not satisfied with it. It's thin body doesn't really do anything for me and it actually is kind of uncomfortable because of it's big head. It smells strongly of plastic, which is highly unappealing, and it doesn't have a good feel to it... so like I said, uncomfortable!I will say that it does have a powerful motor on it but really that's all it has going for it. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Huge!!,"I would have really like to have tried out this product, but the thing is HUGE! I must have overestimated the size of my vag when I bought this because there is no way it h*ll it was getting in. Had to just throw it away :("
2,Broken End!,"This was a really fun product at first. However, after only having it for a few months the entire twist bottom broke off! Now it is useless as a vibrator. Fun while it lasted, but it definitely did not last long enough. Not worth the money just to end up with a lump of plastic."
1,DOA,"I am sure this is frabjous and more....but it arrived DOA, so I'll never know. Sad. And no returns or exchanges. More sad."
3,Good Enuf for the Price,"weeelllll...this was a great price, and it is quiet but I did not quite get the g-spot thing but a bit of vibration on the c-spot is not so bad and it works well enough with enough time and energy -)...i think next time around i will invest a bit more money for something with a bit more power/vibration and that should make the difference but again you get what you pay for and the price was right for the quality received."
4,How it's done,"This product, in conjunction with the Berman Center Athena waterproof mini massager and exotic butterfly kiss is great for whatever your sexual level may be. I have found full sexual arousal and satisfaction with these products and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to take care of business.I recommend buying all three products so you can achieve full sexual arousal and enjoy multiple sensations. Just think of it as your little ""tune-up"" kit;)"
4,"Still like my old one, but this one is rocks too","like i said, i still like my old one. it was a cheap vibrator but it did what it was supposed to. i dont like the fact that this one is bendable. or too flexible. i could have returned the item but i guess it does the job and i am fairly satisfied. i like that its waterproof though."
2,Strong Chemical Smell!,"I would have loved this product, but I had to throw it away due to the overpowering chemical smell. It can't be PVC free."
2,G-Spot?,If this vibrator knows where my G-Spot is....I wish it would show me. Also could be a little bit sronger. It is beautiful. I'll give it that.Not convinced newer is better.lnmkelso
2,Chemical Factory,"I received my ""Lucid Dream"" today in the mail. The vibrator itself was bigger than I expected, but not so big that I wasn't willing to give it a try. So, I opened it. As I did so, I was hit by a wave of chemical stench so strong that it gave me a headache almost instantly. I immediately put it back in its box and started to read. The toy is made with PVC - a fact that would have stopped me from buying it in the first place had I known. Sex toys made with PVC can contain harmful additives. Obviously I have no way of knowing if this particular piece does, but why risk it? Besides, the smell is so off-putting that I can't imagine having it anywhere near me, much less using it for it's intended purpose. If anyone does purchase this, I recommend using a condom with it."
1,Poor Quality,This worked once. No instructions on which way to place batteries. Had to variate till it came on. Ate the batteries fairly quickly then would not turn on again. Choosing a different brand from now on.
1,Awkward and smelly,"I bought this because of the ""great reviews"", and was really disappointed. The toxic smell still hasn't gone away after multiple washes/uses. Besides that, the shape is rather awkward. It's very large at the top and skinny in the body. When I use it, I have to hold it very still, or else it rotates and makes the tip point sideways or down -- which is very uncomfortable, and misses the ""G-Spot"" altogether. Even when I manage to climax, it's rather dull, and doesn't compare to other simpler vibe designs I've used in the past. To me, this product was all hype, and no hoorah."
1,"Great shape, horrible smell","Pros: Great shape for G-spot play, waterproof, decent power on the motorCons: Repulsive disgusting hydrocarbon smell. Not phalate free. Tacky PVC exterior versus hard plastic.I had thought this toy has a hard plastic exterior but I was wrong as Doc Johnson's website states that the toy is constructed from non-toxic ABS plastic and PVC vinyl. The vinyl exterior is a tad bit tacky and smells horrible. Unfortunately, the vinyl in cheaply made sex toys has been documented to contain a wide range of potentially harmful chemicals and sticking this toy into one of the most sensitive and blood rich areas of my body is not what I had in mind - won't be using this one :("
1,Broke immediately!,"I loaded the batteries, and turned the base to start it. The base came off in my hand, and gave me an electrical shock. It was after the 10 days Amazon gives you to return things, so I threw it away. Total waste of money!"
1,Smell is repulsive!,"Despite many washings and cleanings,without using it, the smell of this is so disgusting I would never want to use it!! And despite the fact that it has only been taken out of the package and washed like crazy and never ever used, I can't return it. This one is headed right for the trash and the search for something better and less stinky begins."
1,Scared of chemicals in this thing,It stinks so bad I threw it away. No way am I putting whatever chemicals are attached to this thing inside my body. The smell doesn't go away either.
2,Don't waste your moeny.,Product did not come with lubricant and batteries as advertised when I purchased it. The power is week and therefore don't waste your money on this product.
1,Not So Good,I would not buy this product again.It is very hard to use. The on-off switch is worthlessand it provides very little relief from my aches and pains.
4,"Slight plastic smell, but works great!","Aside from having a slight plastic smell, this works amazingly well! I absolutely love it (and the fact that it's my favorite color doesn't hurt either). Very affordable price for the quality."
2,Eehhhhh,"I mean it's not bad. It was amazing at first but after a while it seems the motor begins to die, and no it isn't the batteries, its the motor."
4,coming to a conclusion of not coming?,Well I love the smell and it feels great I just have not mastered an orgasm without having some type of pleasure on my clitoris. So do I need to get a manual too?
4,Great value,This is a basic tool for the bedroom no frills or ridges to massage but great size and shape. good buy not the go to tool but used on occasion.
3,No quiet,For me i liked it but i didn't LOVE it. It got me to the edge but rarely gets me to the big O i need a little more for that
2,Life span too short,"I loved this product at first, but after the first time I replaced the batteries, the motor burned out. I will purchase a different brand next time."
5,Fantastic Value for Money,"My GF absolutely loves this toy. She found it best used as a clitoral stimulator, but once warmed up she like it for internal use also. Can't beat it for the price. Plastic smell dissipates after a good washing and a couple of days."
2,Disappointing!,"If you're looking for a little sizzle, keep looking. This vibrator is quiet, but weak. I don't know how Doc Johnson counted 14 speeds, but mine was more like three: 1) Is is working? 2) I felt a twinge of something. 3) I think that's a vibration. It also just feels like hard plastic. If you purchased it and are disappointed, trying combining it with a clit flicker so you're not totally disappointed."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"This item refused to turn on. I even tried the tricks listed in some of the other reviews and nothing helped! So, really disappointed. I was looking forward to it. No doubt I won't get a refund so forget it.DO NOT BUY."
5,A Very Happy Wife!,My husband travels a few times a month.. This little Purple Bitch is a great replacement! I am a very Happy Wife!
2,Battery loose connection,"I cant tell you how many times I have been 'right there' and the thing shuts off. The batteries go in through the bottom, and you twist the bottom back on to close it. But when doing so you have to turn it just the right way-if its too tight it wont work and if its too loose it wont work. As you can imagine with the vibrating it kind of begins to untwist on its own. Takes the fun out of it, and I still have yet to find my G spot."
3,It was OK,"Ok, so I decided to go ahead and get this product because the reviews weren't all bad. But honestly it was just ok. It was pretty easy to start up, I'm not sure why so many people had an issue starting it, but for me everything was fine. I'm just going to give two words of advice:1. Be extremely aroused when you use this product. It's quite a fit, and if you're not very wet it can be painful.2. If this is your first time using a G-spot stimulator, go with a smaller, less powerful one. I've never used one before, so this was quite a stretch (I've never climaxed from g-spot stimulation).I'm a rookie, so this is the best review I can give. It doesn't smell, it's easy to use, but it's a whole lot of toy. It works awesome as a massager though."
4,Odd smell but fun to use,"My wife and I have used this on several occasions now and I will say it has a very odd, strong rubbery/plastic smell to it new that does not seem to go away even from washing with soap and water but the vibrate function is great and has added a lot of fun to our relationship."
3,initially one star now a three...,"At first it did NOT work at all. I thought the motor is broken and useless... as a vibrator that is. I tried several batteries and combinations of -+, ++ or +- and was quite annoyed that it did not work and was unreturnable, a waste of ten bucks.After reading several other comments I messed around with how tight I screwed the cap back on and now it works.Not really that strong of a vibe but not bad I suppose. Now to try it on the wifie and see what it does for her G-spot... :-)UPDATE: the vibe still works but wifey prefers it without and loves me using it as a plain dildo... great G-spot stimulation, no special moves, just gentlt thrusting and she goes crazy! when I slowly pop it in and out... her first multiple orgasms. Last time she called it the ""4th of July"" orgasm!"
4,beware of the great purple monster!,"This guy is great. All kinds of vibe going on and very rigid. Don't be fooled by the picture though, this purple beaut is quite large. If you've got a little bitty beaver you might want to try something different for g-spot stimulation. He still works great for external stimulation though!"
4,"Yes, no, maybe","I received the Doc Johnson Lucid Dream 14 and right out of the package it would not work. I tried several sets of batteries with no success. Ripped off again ! With no hope for even a reply I contacted the company just to complain. SURPRISE, SURPRISE! The same day I received a reply that they regreted my experience and a replacement was already shipped and the faulty item need not be returned! Give them 4 stars for quality control and 5+ for customer service. Integrity or what? Great company to deal with."
4,Pretty Darned Good,"I'll agree with what some others have said, it really does smell like plastic when you take it out, but after a use or two it's all broken in and doesn't smell like that any more. It worked like a charm. I had never had a toy like that before and it was a little odd trying it out. Taking it back out is a bit annoying, but all in all a very good product. It is SUPER quiet, and that was absolutely wonderful. I would recomend this if you're looking into it and can work through the initial fresh from the package smell."
4,almost perfect,"This toy could be perfect if the screw top design was better. It's very easy to turn this off by accident b/c the screw top connects directly to the battery and let's be honest there's a lot of moving around and the top can be turned accidentally. So there is a design flaw with that. Otherwise the design is perfect. Used alone or with the Don Juan Pleasure Wand (our favorite) this is a lot of fun. The large head covers a lot of ground, and the design allows for the ""front"" or ""back"" of the head to be effective stimulators. At some point I'll try and get the screw top figured out b/c it shouldn't disconnect from the battery so easily."
5,Very Quiet,"This item is realy nice if you have kids in the room next to you, due to how quiet it is. Very strong vibrations and extreamly smooth surface make it very hard to keep her quiet. From what I'm told it hits all the right spots. And from what I've seen, well I might as well just watch the late show and wait till she shuts it off. When ever that will be. Sleepless in MN."
1,let down,I was disapointed in this product. It did not last one use. It died in the middle of a great sessonand my partner was dissatisfied.
1,zzzz,This toy was fun at first.. but it got boring fast not a big fan of it. Not sure why you all claim this toy is powerful.
2,NOT pleased,I bought this and the same week I got it the wire shorted! I hardly even used it! It's pretty much useless now. NOT impressed at all!
2,Ouch! Thick smelly purple demon machine!,"I'm a 5'5 average lady, I haven't had any kids yet so maybe it's just me but the thick head on this thing is pretty painful. I'm sure eventually I would get used to it but then again why would anyone want to put an enormously thick vibrator up their hoo hoo all the time and risk stretching everything out even more. Just something to keep in mind as you get older... sort of like making the decision to start wearing lots of sunscreen or wear more supportive bras. Gotta keep my junk in good shape!"
1,Verrrrry disapointed!,"We tried to install the batteries in this (There is no indication for which way the batteries go), and after trying several different battery configurations, we got it to turn on, but only without it being very tight. The adjustment knob came loose immediately as well. This thing is a piece of crap!"
5,O-o-o-o-o-o-o ...,What can I say? She loved it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. That was the first night.
2,Not that exciting,"I bought this toy because it had pretty good reviews and was a good price. I would not recommend this at all. It really does nothing for me, so that is why."
4,fun bday gift!,"bought one for my friend's bday. everyone had a good laugh at this creative gift( i told her i got her a ""hair curller""). nicely packaged and well handled."
5,great!,Didn't have any problems with product. Worked on first try and it works GREAT! Would reccomend to any of my friends.
2,not what i expected!,"This product was not what I was expecting at all!! The size of it was nice but that is about all. You can barley tell when its vibrating, I thought it was the batteries so I changed them twice but still ended up with the same results. I would not suggest purchasing this product unless you don't care about the non-vibrating part."
4,I like the diffrent speeds,"The Plastic smell is strong yuckk. but hey atleast you know it is new! This is my first Vibrator i like it , its quite and the different speeds are the best. cant wait to use it with my partner! I only gave it a 4 because of the strong plastic smell cant have my vagina smelling like that! haha"
1,Never worked,"First you have to try every combination to figure out how the batteries are supposed to be installed. After going through every combination three times, I still could not get the thing to turn on. I read the other 1 star reviews and didn't think it would happen to me, but it did. Why this product is not returnable and other similar products are is a mystery. Waiting to see if Amazon will replace it like they did for other customers."
4,Great Value,"Given the price I really wasn't expecting much. However, this seems very well made and though the vibration could be a bit stronger, it works great. Wife is pretty picky and she got attached to this one right away. Will probably be ordering another to have a back up."
4,"Great toy, even better price!","This toy is really quite powerful in term of vibrations, albeit a little bit more buzzy than thrummy than I usually prefer. It's also just as great for clit play as g-spot wit it;s nicely curved tip. Pretty packaging, nice color, very satisfied with it. I took off one star for the strong plasticky smell though I have had it for a week or so and it still smells like plastic and chemicals, albeit a great deal less so since I have washed and used it more than once. I expect it will be gone completely before long, and the performance of the toy far outweighs the temporary smell.Overall, a great toy and even better at this price! (I think I paid about $14 for it)."
1,I cant believe this!! DOES NOT WORK,"I was thinking about buying this toy for a long time to try it out, I was so excited when it came thru...But I tried so many different batteries on it, it just wont work, IT wont vibrate...Im so disappointed in Amazon because this was send by amazon not any other seller..and I thought Amazon would stand up for its name...hmmm makes me wonderBut guess what else is so dandy?I cant even return this thing...so I can not use it because it doesn't work and I can not return it. what Do I just throw away like 15 bucks..yep thanks AmazonI wont be buying from Amazon again..right when i was becoming a huge fan of amazon, well...hello ebay!"
5,awesome,this was a gift and man does it work sure is fun and make it squirt almost everytime loves it
1,Didn't work,"Tried every battery combination possible and could never get it to work, can't return it, too much hassle to order a replacement"
4,Wonderful,"The widest part of the head is a bit big for me, but other than that this is a great product. Waterproof, multiple speeds, etc are appreciated. I really like that it's very bendy so I can insert the tip into my v and have vibrations all the way up to my clit. I just had 4 orgasms in one session! Great for the price; I hope it lasts."
1,horrible chemical smell,Don't buy this product. It has a horrible chemical smell (similar to spray paint). I'm worried it would give me a strange rash if actually used. It is gross and other brand vibes do not have any odor. It is also can not be returned so it is a waste of money.
1,Doesn't work & yet can't be returned - BEWARE!!,"This item doesn't work and yet is not eligible for return. I wasted money on it, is what Amazon is telling me. I find this to be pretty irritating. Don't go for this, people!!!!!!!"
2,not vibrating when i used it,"i know i can't return this product, though i like the appearance of this product,but it was not vibrating when i was using it ,i install the batery correctly n that worked when i twisted the bottom, but when i used it at night ,it sometimes worked, but most of the time could not vibrate ,i had a bad feeling when i sued it,that was the first sex toy i bought."
1,Gross,I bought this even though many said it had a bad odor. I had no idea how bad it would be. I have to store it in a ziplock bag or it makes the whole closet stink! It is not powerful at all and was a waste of money. I recommend either the Pocket Rocket or the Butterfly kiss. They have much more power and no smell!
1,Defective,"Got this product and it was defective wont even turn on and I can't return it. I tried every possible comination the batteries can go, wont even turn on or buzz or anything. Thanks again amazon for screwing me over not letting me return a defective item."
4,Great price,"Discrete shipping, good price, very powerful. I like this a lot but It's really weird-shaped so I don't ""insert"" it. It's just so weird-shaped. But it works for sure LOL! good settings for different levels of vibration.The material is really good because it isn't really rubbery so it's hard to clean, but not such hard plastic that you could feel the seams."
4,Yes!,Absolutely love! I have bought this product many many times. Love how it shapes to the body and I recharge the batteries. Only thing negative is that is breaks easily. The vibrator control at the end of the vibrator does break and usually only one speed. Great for the price!!
2,"It's alright, but it stopped working.",The GF didnt really like the feeling of it and the shape. the multi-speed portion wasn't noticeable. They don't have the battery terminals marked for the orientation of the batteries to go in. We used it 6-7 times and now it doesn't vibrate. It also looks alot smaller in the picture than it really is. Luckily it wasn't all that expensive. If you think you'd like the shape and a light vibration speed this might be for you.
1,Pathetic and it stinks,"Pro: Looks pretty, InexpensiveCons: It stinks (even after weeks and several soakings in soap and water), vibrations are a jokeWould not recommend"
1,Piece of Junk,"Was very excited about getting this toy and having some fun. Got the package, got it opened got hit with the horrible plastic smell. I was expecting the smell because of the other reviews, but WOW it was strong. I figured, what the heck let me see what this thing will do. Put the batteries in and NOTHING!! I turned the batteries around, tried new ones, etc.. still NOTHING! Very disappointed, if I could return it I would. I wouldn't recommend buying this at all, try a different brand."
1,deader than dead,"I had this two weeks and it died. (it got used about five times and died)Besides that, I've had cheaper ones and they were more powerful than this. It wasn't all that 'stimulating'. LOL!I wouldn't buy this one again, I have a california exotics that's still going strong a year later."
3,Looks better than it performs,"From what I understand, even though this looks like it would be a wonderful toy; it falls FAR from meeting expectations. Nice design AND price but, with little vibration."
3,Doesn't do much for the G spot,Bought this for my wife as a first toy. I thought it might be fun to use in the shower since it is waterproof. The product looks and performs as advertised but the internal stimulation just didn't happen as we'd hoped. It does however do well with external clitoral stimulation. The unit is fairly solid and quiet as advertised. It does get quite slippery once its lubed up and can be a bit hard to grip. Overall it's a good value.
3,It's Ok,This seems to be an OK vibrator. My wife likes it but it doesn't have that extreme good feeling that other reviewers experienced. No complaints about the item though. It works great.
3,Strong but....,"This is a strong enough vibrator, but it stinks! If u can deal with the smell try it but other than that, let this one pass. I've owned many different vibes but wanted a G spot vibe and decided to try this. I think I'm just gonna buy an attachment for my magic wand and hope for the best. The smell just strikes me as unsafe."
2,Unfortunately the horrible plastic smell doesn't go away with time.,"I bought one in 2009. Hated the horrible plastic smell. Now in 2011, that horrible plastic smell STILL has not gone away. Would not buy again and it's put me off any kind of plastic product of this type. WHAT were they thinking? Yick."
1,The product won't stay on.,Not happy with this product. It doesn't even work if you screw on the end all the way. You have to loosen up the to get it to work then it goes off and on if you don't handle it right. I'm not very happy with this product.
5,awesome lil toy,"this toy rocks!! my only issue with it is that bc its pretty bendy in the shaft, which is great for vaginal and clitoral...for actual vaginal g-spot stimulation, it isnt firm enough for me.. but it gets me off every other way so no complaints! ;)its pretty quiet too, though after 4-5 months of use, it gets a lil noiser hehe"
1,DO NOT BUY,"For the love of god and all that is holy, do not buy this. I have never before seen or even heard of a vibrator that, when turned on, would actually CATCH FIRE. I am not making that up. It literally caught on fire on the first attempt to use it."
1,Never worked,I was very disappointed. This item never worked. I tried a number of of times but void never get to work.
5,WOW,"I love this product!Super-easy to clean and store. The length was perfect, and the curved and rounded top was perfect for hitting the g-spot! The vibration was really quiet and discreet. And it's great for other areas too..."
1,TOO LITTLE VIBRATIONS,"Firstly, IT BROKE on the second time I used it.Secondly, it has a nice shape and reaches all the right spots. The material is smooth and offers the perfect resistance to maneuver it. It's easy to clean.The vibration isn't great. There are better ones out there.If the vibrations were better and if it hadn't broken, it would have been one of my favorites."
3,effective,The product is as described and functions effectively. I did not detect any unpleasent oder as others have. The battery compartment lid is a little unsure and I had to snug it down a couple of times to get it to work other wise I am quite satisfied.
4,It works,"I purchased this because my hubby dearest wanted to find that ""special spot""... well with this it was easily located. It was a little uncomfortable at first but once you figure out just how much you can handle inserted, it was a gem! The only thing I didn' t like about it was the way it smelled when it was shipped. It smelled like burning rubber (funny, I know) but after several scrubbings with warm soapy water, it was a whole lot better! Ladies, if you want to discover that ""special spot"" give this one a try"
5,Wife likes it!,"My wife likes this vib quite a bit. Not sure why specifically, but it has a fairly large head and shaft compared to others and it has an angle that puts the stimulation directly on her G spot. Regardless, after the first use and a nice orgasm, she said ""Well, I guess it works!"" It continues to be one of her favorites."
3,Big and loud,"Uncomfortably big, and drains batteries really fast. However, with fresh batteries it is quite powerful. Not bad for the price."
2,Not great but worked.,"The vibration was not very powerful and the cap for the batteries did not line up properly so if we had wanted to use it in water we would not have been able to. She came and was happy but I would not recommend this to anyone, it got here fast and served it's purpose."
4,Not bad,"This is a good vibrator. It was a little larger at the tip then I originally thought it would be, but it wasn't that bad."
2,Good while it lasted,"Very annoyed. Honestly, I expected something better. While it worked it was great! Very nice very effective. However, it broke about 2 weeks into ownership. Tried new batteries and everything. It was very done. So whatever."
2,Didn't get the wife going,"Was hoping for a little more of an impact when my wife first used this. She said it was so-so, but not all that amazing. Wishes it was a little stronger of a vibration. It stinks like plastic/chemicals too. Hoping that may go away, but other reviews indicate it may not."
2,broken,"I really enjoyed this product, but the control broke off after just a couple of uses. I would not recommend It to anyone else who is interested in purchasing."
4,Works well with strong vibration,"This vibrator has been a friend of mine for about a year now. It's easy to clean, waterproof, and gets the job done. I didn't give it five stars because it can be loud when on full blast. Overall though, I would recommended it to others."
3,It works,"When taken out of package it had a peculiar smell. It was also bigger than I expected! I tried it out and it brought me to satisfaction rather quickly. It looked big but it fit very well. The main problem was when you screwed the battery cap on it missed the contacts for the batteries and wouldn't work unless you left it loose. This wasn't good because the control is a dial on the end of the battery cap! I had a thin gasket that I placed at the bottom of the threads, and it allowed the cap to be screwed on tightly so the speed could be easily adjusted.For the misaligned cap and smell I only gave it three stars."
4,VERY QUITE IF NEEDED,"GREAT VIBRATOR, HAVENT HAD A CHANCE TO TRY BUT ONCE BUT IT GOT THE JOB DONE. THE VIB WAS BIGGER THAT I THOUGHT BUT I WAS STILL ABLE TO HANDLE IT. GREAT PRODUCT"
4,Worth every penny!,"This vibrator is great! Although, it is slightly larger than I anticipated, which makes insertion a bit uncomfortable. I strictly use this for clitoral stimulation and I love it! The material it is made of does smell awful, but I don't mind because it gets the job done :)"
2,Worth $12... Nothing more!,"So it does have a weird smell when you get it home but the thing I don't like is that it was too hard and not ""human enough""...I would prefer if it was either a vibrator or a dild0.. not this thing that does both while trying to stimulate your g-spot! Not a huge fan!"
2,Short life!,it worked good...when it worked. It died within a couple weeks after I got it and its not the batteries!
2,also not impressed,"I was replacing a different type of vibrator, thought this one and its sleek design would be just what the Dr. ordered but it is lack luster and the vibration at the highest speed is medium at best. Who knew finding the ""right"" one would be so challenging? I have to keep looking, maybe mail order is not the best way to seek Mr. right..."
3,Good - but bad smell!,"If it wasnt for the smell, id rate this product as great! Tried perfume and flavoured condoms, but the smell still did not go away."
1,broken,"Looks nice and arrived in original packaging... But doesn't work! Brand new batteries, put in correctly and absolutely nothing happens. Highly disappointed."
1,no good!,"this thing depressed me, i dont know how these other women got off, because it was like nothing for me and really upset me a vibrator should be a sure thing, its not soft or very flexible its pretty hard--and not in the good way, it is pretty silent and it is waterproof and the plastic smell does exsist but washes right away, but it is not strong, get a trinity rabbit its so worth it."
1,Worthless when broken,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream 14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator... it arrived broken and its not returnable. More wasted money on crap"
2,Wife not really happy,Bought for my wife ! She said not anought power and not the best feel. for the money she was not happy
4,"Good product, good price","This is a great first toy for any girl or guy. The contours make it very comfortable, and the vibration is strong enough as well. The plastic smell does linger, but you will only smell it if you have the toy near your face. Otherwise this product is perfect. Cleaning is easy also. A wonderful buy!"
4,Eh...,"I like the style, shape and look, however, it isn't very strong. I guess you have to compromise when you choose something 'quiet', which this is, but I expected more especially since it takes two AAs. I don't think I would suggest this to someone other than maybe the shape."
2,horrid smell,"i rated this two stars because of the smell! it is very strong and after some research, i discovered that it is not only very common but also permanent. apparently it is the material that it is made of that smells so strongly. i find it hard to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. disappointed."
2,Skip it,"If your looking to spend some quality time with yourself....there are better options out there. While the vibration is nothingto sneeze at, its not comfertable to use and the worst part is the SMELL! Yikes. Its is very strange and quite strong plastic smellthat is quite sickning. i thought if i washed it, the smell would fade,but i was soo wrong. It's hard to feel the sexy when that pundgent plastic smell is killing whatever i was in the mood for. Pretty package, empty shell."
2,big,the head of this is too big for it to be a g spot vibe it hurts however if your loose or have kids might be a good fit for you
1,Nasty plastic-finger nail polish remover smell,This item smells like finger nail polish remover. I couldn't imagine putting it even close to my body. I tried soaking it in soap solution but still smells horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Awful,I can't describe how dangerous this was for me. After using it I made sure the knob was turned all the way off and I unscrewed it a little so it wouldn't fire off accidentally. I came back 20 minutes later and smelled something burning. the bottom plastic had COMPLETELY melted onto the wood bottom of my drawer. I couldn't touch it for 20 minutes because it was so hot. I'm surprised it didn't burn a hole in my drawer. Fire hazard product and even before it melting was very touchy and would only work if I screwed it on just enough. DO NOT GET THIS!
1,128 People CAN be wrong! Don't waste your money on this.,"Clearly 128 people CAN be wrong. I made the mistake of trusting the positive reviews over the negative reviews. The smell is pretty strong and doesn't seem to improve after washing it with strongly scented soap but I can live with the smell, what makes this product absolutely useless to me is that the motor is VERY WEAK even on the highest setting using really good rechargeable batteries. The person who said it's about as weak as the vibration from a cell phone wasn't too far off. The only positive thing that I can say about this item is that it is so quiet that a fan could cover up the noise. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, spend a little more for something better than this. My quest for a STRONG yet relatively QUIET vibe continues."
2,Not To Her Liking,I bought this to play with with the wife - she didn't like it. We've had a number of vibrators but this one doesn't have the power that she needs - she said it feels like it might have the power but the jelly-substance makes it not be powerful enough. We're definitely not going to be using this vibrator unless there are no other options.
1,Not Quite Up To Par,"I was excited to recieve this item, only to be dissapointed after the first use. The viberator lacks much intensity, which does not assist in stimulation. The toy itself is very hard. I would comparte it to being glass, without the cold factor. Lastly, i thought the shape would help in getting me to the place i need, concidering it is a gspot vibe, but it was lacking in that area as well. Overall i would not purchase this viberator."
3,"Good for the price, until it stops working",This was a nice vibrator until I tried to use it in the bath. Now it's just a plastic stick.
3,Eh-It's Ok,I bought this to spice up my love life with my husband. I also bought it because he was going to be gone all the time so I thought it might come in handy. Its not bad but it doesn't get any job done as far as I'm concerned.
2,Disappointed,I love the way it feels inside..but it never worked properly. The vibrator never quite vibrated. I still use it on occasion to fill me up w/a stimulator on the clitoris. If this worked properly I would probably pass out.
3,Lucid dream vibrator,"The advertising is better than the product. It has a distinct odor to it that took weeks to fade away, but never did go away completely. The vibrator is not very powerful, although the design is such that it hits the spot that doesn't take a whole lot of vibration. We will keep it in the drawer to use on occasion, but it will not be the subject of a lot of planning and anticipation."
2,Broken,"It was nice (not great) the first couple times I used it... but the third time it just broke. The first two times I couldn't get anywhere with this alone.Even though it no longer works I still use it for the ""full"" feeling with another vibrator. It is quite a bit bigger than the pic indicates, but its manageable."
2,Don't Waste your Money,"This item arrive in good condition, but the smell keeps us from trying it. Strong odor of material it is made of. Other products we have received went away after a short time and washing."
1,Fun only lasted 15 minutes..,"My boyfriend and I ordered this toy from the hustler hollywood website, ours shorted out after 15 minutes... The 15 minutes were great, but highly dissappointed.I've had other ""Doc JohnsonL products last for years. :("
3,Not very powerful/feels strange/torn top,"Pros:I like the color.The shape is alright.It seems like it would be good for someone who doesn't use vibrators a lot.Cons:Very weak vibration.I can feel the tip well but the tapered shape makes it feel strange.The tip of the toy has a weird tear in it.Over all, I don't think I would have bought this if I could have seen it first.. whoops."
1,Waste of money,This was a waste of money it doesn't work. I'm glad that I didn't spend a lot of money for it..I would not recommend it to anyone
1,Waste of money!!!!,"This is a waste of money! I got this because of the great reviews. I thought it would be more powerful with the egg in the tip, for clitoral and G spot stimulation....No such luck. Yes it is very quiet,(because it hardly vibrates.) I am a very sensitive in my personal area, so it doesn't take a lot to get me off, but this was just awful. I recommend that you do not buy this product."
4,works well,shipped quickly and was represented correctly. Would recomend company and product to anyone. Lots of fun trying to find the G-spot. LOL
5,Heaven,"Water proof. Batteries last a long time. OOOOOOOOhh yes. Not bad. Quieter than other brands, but still makes noise. Just turn on TV or radio louder and you're good to go."
1,Horrible chemical smell,I couldn't get past the strong chemical odor of this product. It made me want to gag. I haven't used it because of that. I will not use it either.
3,easy to use,easy to use. good vaule for the money. nice that is was waterproof. i would recommend for this product for the price
3,"Not bad, but not amazing.","It has some great power to it and it's great bang for your buck, but not one of my favorites."
3,Way bigger than it appears,"Well it vibrates like crazy and that's good, but as a G-Spot stimulator I don't think so. The thing is so darn big and rigid it is painful to insert, so the only G-Spot it stimulated for me was ""gee get that thing outta me""."
2,Great once working... while it lasted,"It was a bit tricky getting it to work initially and yes, it does have a smell, but no need to use it near your nose. I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much, but while not flexible, the size was good and length great; the adjustable dial gave you the exact speed you want. After 3 months it was drying on the counter after being washed (not submerged) it turned on, I assumed I had accidentally turned it on, however I had to remove the cap to get it to turn off. When I went to use it again it wouldn't work even with new batteries. I am disappointed!"
1,disapointed,"I was not very pleased this item at all, It didn't do what it said it would,the product said that it was a g-spot stimulation,I found it heavy and hard,all it did was make me spot tender."
2,Vibrations not strong enough,"I purchased this product because the rabbits I owned didn't provide strong enough g spot stimulation. However, this item doesn't provide enough stimulation. The highest setting is extremely mild, about as strong as a video game controller vibration. After I applied lubricant and inserted it, I had to adjust it several times to feel anything. Additionally, the hard material makes insertion uncomfortable if you are dry.If you are looking for a budget sized g spot stimulator, I recommend theTrinity Vibes Pink Waterproof Rabbit Vibrator. While I have to use a bullet externally to get the vibration I'm looking for, the g spot vibration from that product is very satisfying."
3,Bigger than it looks.,"First of all, this thing is much bigger than it looks. It's almost 6"" long. It doesn't smell as other said. but the vibration isn't that strong."
1,Doc Johnson Lucid Dream,"At first, I was in love with this vibrator. I received it on 8-14-12 (4 days late - which was no big deal for me) but now I'm pretty pissed. 10 days after getting the product and using it occasionally, it just....died. I was in the middle of using it this morning and it just stopped working. I thought ""this is weird"" because I'd just put new batteries in, but I got up, changed them, and still nothing. I put in 3 sets of new batteries without any difference. I need a refund or an exchange, this is completely unacceptable."
1,seriously do not buy!,this product wasn't strong enough to get my juices flowing. no big O for me with this one. save yourself the frustration and do not buy. it's a good thing I have a back up rabbit.
1,I wish returns could be made,This smells so toxic! I took it out the box and tossed it in the garbage. Smells like it would be very bad for your insides.
1,Big Mistake,"I've owned one other Doc Johnson toy, and I threw it out the day I got it. I should have known better this time.It stinks. Literally. I washed it with antibacterial toy cleaner, covered it with 2 condoms, and the stench was still nauseating. How can one possibly feel sexy with that odor?There are so many options out there. AVOID this one. If you need to stay inexpensive, try the Clit Hummer. It's not soft, but it has no odor and it's pretty damn powerful."
1,No Pleasure Here!,"I agree with some of the other reviews. It has an aweful smell. It was also too big for me. It felt very uncomfortable. I tried using it several times with adequate lubrication thinking maybe if I got use to it, it would bring me some pleasure. Well, no pleasure here! After setting it aside for sometime, it still has an aweful smell and now it has a sticky feel to it that won't go away. I'm not sure if it's because the toy has been sitting unused for a while. Whatever the reason for the sticky residue, it's just one more reason for not liking this toy. I want to throw it out but worry about polluting the environment. Does anyone know of a way to safely discard unwanted sex toys? Oh well, for now it sits in my lockable Vibe chest, unused and will remain UNUSED! My suggestion, by-pass this toy. There are other toys available that are way better then this one."
2,Use a condom,This thing smells terrible & is very irritating to sensitive vaginal tissue. Didn't really get much from it. Wouldn't buy again.
3,Easily Broken,This line is a fun line. However the product itself is poorly made. I am on my third one. I was not going to rebuy it but DH thinks it was worth one more chance. The first one got so hot the controls melted. This was after 2 months. The second one had a motor burn out after three months. I also owned three more units from the Lucid Dream line and all 3 malfunctioned after 2-4 months.
5,extremely satisfied ;),"This is a great vibrator, especially for the price. It has very powerful (but adjustable) vibrations. The vibrator itself is located at the top instead of the bottom so you really feel it. It does have that plastic-like smell but it isn't bothersome to me. It also has great battery life. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,!!!!!,"I love this thing!!! I've had mine for about 3 months and I use it all the time! It really hits the spot. I wouldn't mind the vibrations being stronger, but this is my first toy and I have to say it is pretty awesome!!!"
4,Good thing,"This thing is good. It's kind of loud, but not super loud relative to the awesome power forces inside of it. Plus it cleans easily and it doesn't even suck up batteries like my old vibe.One complaint: I've had it a year now, washed it many times, and it still reeks of plastic. What gives?"
1,plastic is too hard,Wife almost hit me over the head when I tried this toy for foreplay. It's plastic is too hard for enjoyment!
1,Horrible,"I thought this was going to be good, and it was my first vibrator, I think I chose the wrong one. It didn't work, and it was painful to even try. I tried to use it as a regular vibrator, but it doesn't even really help either. It's just not worth it."
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased this item, put batteries in it and nothing!! No movement at all. Tried another set of batteries and still nothing!!!"
3,instead of a bunny,"I got this in combo with the Wild G and butterfly kiss by California Exotics. I like the twist control of this over the push button of the butterfly. I use this more as an external clitoral stimulator than a g-spot stimulator. I used to have a bunny but like this better as the vibrating part is at the very tip. This is made of a harder material than the other 2. Nothing wrong with this but it was less rubbery or flexible than I thought it would be. If you are creative you can use this during sex, not so for the other 2 but for alone time this one is #3 of the 3 I puchased at once. The Wild G is effective as both G spot and clitoral stimulator if you want both at the same time."
3,only ok,"I had high hopes for this but like others have said there is a strong, weird plastic smell that doesn't seem to go away and is a bit off putting. I found the power of the vibrations to be weak to middling and didn't find it to be very good as a g-spot vibrator but worked fairly well on the clitoris. I had no problem with the size of the egg on insertion and I'm no size queen. Overall it's ok, but there are a lot of better options out there."
4,"A solid vibrator, but not for beginners!","This is my first vibrator. I've never experienced an orgasm, so I thought a good way to try would be with a vibrator. However, the head of this one is way too thick for me. It's painful to insert and remove. So I think I'll use it for external experimentation for now one.For women more experienced with sex toys, I think this would be a great vibrator. It's easy to use and VERY quiet. I was actually surprised by this aspect. I wouldn't say that the vibrator has ""14"" speeds as advertised. But it does range from soft to powerful. So I was pleased by that, as well.Overall, it's a very good vibrator. The plastic smell isn't very strong and it works very reliably. But beware if you're not accustomed to internal sex toys. It may be too large for you like it is for me."
3,Love Doc Johnson and Sue Johanson products,"Esp the rabbit type products; Sue's Royal surfer was my fav till I tried a rabbit! This one - the lucid dream wasn't flexible enough for me, it was too large, and too firm, and yes, a rather off-putting smell.I tried it a couple of times, and then put it away. Unfortunately bought an extra as a gift - a first for someone, and then was too disappointed to give it to her. I'll take a rabbit everytime - they have 2 vibes in them - one higher and one lower - to catch two different areas of stimulation - which it does SO well!"
3,Acceptable,"I wasn't thrilled with this product. It has a strong plastic smell and is a little difficult to change the level of vibrations without slipping a little. However, it does get the job done and has a great range of different levels of vibrations (as opposed to ""high"" and ""low"") and is waterproof,which is a huge plus. I would recommend it for more advanced users."
1,Cheap product,"I bought this product based on the reviews and it broke the first time I used it. The screw on knob assembly came apart when I tried to unscrew it. Very cheaply made, it was just glued together."
3,needs more power,good size and shape but GF says its not powerful enough. its very nice and flexible but main thing is it doesn't have enough power. for those of you wondering how much power does it have? i would compare the high power setting to that of a cell phone vibrating or maybe an xbox controller vibrating. not very satisfying
4,hard as a rock and deep stimulation,"not my favorite toy but i'll say what i can. first it does come with a smell like all toys. the plastic is hard as a rock, not kidding. it doesnt bend at all but maybe thats your fancy. the vibration at the tip is good for deep stimulation but if you like to keep moving while you in the peak of passion dont get it because the muscles clamp on it and it kinda can get a bit stuck and hard to move. but if you want to keep it deep and not move than its good."
3,Prettty good,"Not as strong as I wanted but it works ok. It needs more power or zoom!? Mostly it was a let down, maybe it will be more fun when we use it together?"
3,"Attractive Design, Decent Power, Bad Odor",This G Spot Vibrator comes with an unwanted odor which smells like airplane glue and dissipated only partially when washed with soap and warm water. It is silent when in use but I thought the vibrations could have been a bit stronger considering the motor is located at the tip. Still for the money it is an attractive and smoothly functioning vibrator which should be what the doctor ordered.
3,Not particularly thrilling,"It certainly is pretty, I'll give it that. It's a bit large though for G-spot action, and at the same time doesn't seem to have the right shape to reach it. It's got some powerful settings, but doesn't do much for me without external help. I'll stick to my Lelo Mia and Don Wand thanks :)"
4,Great for the G spot,"This toy is awesome...worked great every time... Hard enough for the g spot orgasm...My last toy i broke within a week or two, this one has lasted a year with ruff play...totally worth every penny"
3,Powerful Vibrator,This has a very powerful bullet in it and if used right you'll know it. My only dislike is that the tip is big and not very flexable.
5,Wife loves it !!!,"Bought this for the wife a year ago now. At first she was a little concernwd about the shape & the diameter but after a little playing around we found that it goes in great. She says it works better on her clit than it does for thursting though because of the change in diameter from the shaft to the head. The curved head makes it very easy to keep it ""in the zone"". This toy has replaced all the other vibrators I've bought for us. Great product has held up to a years worht of playtime and is still going strong.Highly recommend this one."
5,:)),The first one I ordered was not working and Amazon replaced it with a new one free for me and i am so glad to use it. There are many different ways to use it. The different speeds do help and it is just totally amazing!
5,WOW,"While a little painful to start, once you get used to this it will give you the g orgasm of your life."
3,Sleek,Sleek design and comfortable. The multi-speed is a plus for this product and I do recommend this product. I personally like it.
2,hmmm,"Honestly?I did not become a fan. Too big to handle myself, hard to the touch. We did not become friends."
5,LUV IT...So Happy To Have It AGA,what can i say i really like this toy it my second time repurchasing it from amazon n I'm completely satisfied with the length n the size can be used as an anal toy too...and has AMAZING speeds...and they last my first one lasted about 5 years which is awesome...so i would definitely recommend you order it...
1,not worth it,"This was my first purchase of a vibrator and I waited patiently for this and was very disappointed when I used it. It is not worth the money spent,it advertises 14 setting, but it does not vibrate even at the highest setting, I am returning for a refund."
2,It smells!,I thought this would be an interesting vibrator so I bought it. The smell of the material is unappealing to me even after washing and air drying. I think it's PVC. I don't think I'll be using it though it seems to run just fine.
2,smudgy on reflective surfaces,"Excited to try these to make cleaning our stovetop easier, but all they did was leave a streaky linty mess that I had to use another towel to clean up after. Nothing convenient about that."
4,Easy Windex,"QUICK,EASY AND DISPOSABLE, LESS MESS. DOWN SIDE DRYS OUT FAST.....THEY SHOULD MAKE THE PACKAGE RESEALABLE..."
2,Far too much lint left behind.,"""Streak-free"" doesn't count for much when the surface is covered with lint after cleaning. This is unacceptable for a product specifically designed for glass. I've tried several packages (as well as the earlier wipes that came in a plastic tube/container) so I'm fairly sure this problem isn't anecdotal. While convenient, regular bottled Windex and paper towels will do a superior cleaning job for less money."
5,Great Western Story,"A rough and tumble gunfighting story, the version I have is part of a Ace double novel and only 109 pages written under the pseudonym of Barry Cord, the story of a Civil War veteran looking for revenge for the wrongful hanging of his partner and a ranch foreman rustling his own cattle, justice reigns and no love story, should have been longer:-)."
1,It came broken....,"This appears to be a decent product, but I really can't tell. Mine came with a timer that 1/2 the LCD didn't work, so you really couldn't configure it or even set the time. From a slip in the box which describes this fault, It sounds like this is a known manufacturing problem. The worst part is that AMAZON basically abandoned me. They shipped me a faulty product and then said ""call the manufacturer"". My suggestion, if you are going to buy one of these, buy it somewhere with a return policy, not through AMAZON."
3,Better than the others,"I tried one of the ""wheel"" design auto feeders before I bought this one, and this one is much, much better designed. It works well, and so far has not given me any problems. I had to use it several times to figure out how much food to dole out, but I think I have it figured out now. The timer was easy to program, although the directions included with the product were confusing and hard to figure out. If you can set a clock radio, you can program this thing to feed your cat/dog.The one drawback is that my cat figured out that he could stick his paw up in the hole where the food comes out and pull out a kibble of food at a time. When I use this thing he sits there and gorges all day making himself sick. Its better than not having any food though. My other cat hasn't figured this ""hack"" out yet, so you will just have problems if your cat is seriously desperate to eat all the time, and is extremely mischievous."
1,Ergosys Auto Pet Feeder Failure,"I put a Model 2000GS Ergosys Auto Pet Feeder into service on March 8, 2012, to feed my cat. While away in October (7 months of operation) the feeder stopped dispensing food. The motor seemed to operate, but no food dropped. The company said I needed a new base and to send $70 for shipping. Many companies which serve Alaska ship warranty items for free. Ergosys would have none of it. I do not want to ""throw good money after bad"" and decided to throw the feeder in the trash."
1,Great when it works,"The product does a great job, when and if it works. The motor is a cheap Chinese motor, which they do not offer as a replacement part. I have had two motors fail, after warranty of course. They do not repair--the best they can do is sell you a new base, with the $3.00 motor, for about $70.00. The timer is available, for less at hardware stores. Shipping is excessive--I ended up paying $26.00+ to ship a small plastic spout($15) for the feeder.It is a great idea, it is just too expensive for molded plastic and a cheap motor. They need to do more testing.If you have problems, they are very hard to deal with. Customer service is a big problem. It is all about making money."
5,Wonderful! Once the timing is set right,"I bought this for my diabetic cat, and after setting it up I found the product to be a wonderful help to her feedings. Only once did it feed too much, but I found that it was MY mistake in the settings, not the product. 20 seconds dispensed 1/8 cup of food (this depends on kernell size) and she had feedings set for every 4 hours round the clock. This helped to stabalize her blood sugar, knowing when and how much she ate. I highly recommend this product, but also recommend patience and double checking the settings prior to just leaving the animal unattended with the dish. I would buy one again, as it is well worth the money spent. Mine has worked great for over 2 years with little adjustments other than cleaning."
2,Full of errors and novice style of programming,Stay away unless you are desperate to lay hands on any data structures book. It has so many errors. Poor editing can confuse you. The code is written in often very beginner's style while no thought is given to Whys and Why Nots of an approach. Definitely not a good reference. Use and throw perhaps.The program outputs are needlessly printed without any sensible explaination for most of them.
1,"Bla, bla, bla",This book is great for people just looking for some impressiv Shakespeare phrases to spice up their speeches. The book is full of common sense and does not provide any in-depth analysis of the characters. Beside that the endless desriptions of how the authors succeed in their businesses (good for them!) is boring and do not provide concrete ideas or strategies.
4,Revelatory Remastering,"While it's true that there are some odd choices on this collection (the other reviews have said it: some of my favorite Thompson tunes aren't here), as someone who has nearly all the albums represented, let me say that the remastering is positively revelatory. Songs that were okay on the original CD come alive on this disk.I still say the definitive RT album is Watching the Dark. But for someone interested in one of the great out-of-mainstream songwriter/guitarist of the last 30 years, Action Packed makes an excellent introduction. The remastering makes it valuable to us long-time fans as well."
4,"A great recent ""Thompson"" collection.","I often wonder how this guy isn't twice as popular, then I decide I like being part of the secret. Thompson sets many a mood on here with his quick fingers. He can whip out the pop-rockers like ""Turning of the Tide"", ""Feel So Good"", and ""Razor Dance"", or he can slow the pace with songs like ""Waltzing's for Dreamers"", ""Keep Your Distance"", or the excellent ""Beeswing"". This also includes my favorite ""Bathsheba Smiles"", which is a great upbeat number, and the big fan favorite ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"", probably one of the best ""story"" songs ever. I've seen him a few times, and he always seems to play that one. The only things I miss on here are ""Read About Love"" and ""Crawl Back Under My Stone"", otherwise this is the best place to start if your looking for your first, or only ""Richard Thompson"" cd."
2,GOOD FOR A FAN,"I BOUGHT IT FOR ""PURSUASION"" THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS NOTHING LIKE THAT SONG. I IMAGINE A DIE HARD FAN WOULD LOVE IT. I DON'T"
2,not another Eric Clapton!,"I gave this 2 stars because my computer won't play samples and I purchased the CD only on reviews. If I had listened to the CD I would of moved on to real talent! First of all I've haven't experience any talent on the guitar! I would rate his chord playing talents in the likes of Bob Dylan or Willie Nelson (but not the song writing and singing talents!) I've personally heard better performers at the city park. This guy can't sing, definitly can't play a guitar, or arrange background music. If you Richard Thompson's fans want to hear a real guitar player, who can play, sing, and arrange great songs, listen toShawn Phillips!"
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...to suggest Eric Clapton is more famous because of marketing mean some reviewer has too much wax in his ears. Richard isn't even close to the same league. Even as a ""best of"" it barely rises to the 3 star level."
2,sorry,"i just don't like greatest hits much. i'm sure some of these songs are pretty good, but i'd have to say buy something like ""shoot out the lights"" instead."
3,Please don't pick this text!,"This book may be a helpful desk reference for a practitioner, but it is not a practical introduction to Securities Regulation for a student. Most people in the course (even gunner, Law Review types) have given up reading the text, as it is very, very dense and yet still manages not provide the necessary context for the subject matter. We dislike it and it doesn't appear that the professor likes it any better than we do. I will say that the text is well edited and formatted - which often is not the case with legal texts."
5,Radical architecture and aesthetics,"While the other reviewers have made valid arguments (vis a vis the infeasibility of Ms. Hadid's works and the lack of conventional diagrams), if one comes to this book from a context other than pragmatic architecture, then this book is a joy.For myself, I approached this book through an appreciation of Sadar Vuga, the Designer's Republic, and Mike Young (of designgraphik fame). From this context, 'Buildings and Projects' is a wonderful collection of works from a visionary and graphically talented designer-artist."
2,Exceptional!,"This is a fantastic compilation of Hadid's work. It's more comprehensive than the El Croquis, although there is no long interview. There is adequate text for each project, however.If you like her work, or are interested in contemporary architecture, I highly recommend it. It's fairly inexpensive and catalogues her exceptional work."
2,"Abstract book, difficult to keep looking through","I don't own this book. I actually flipped through it tonight at a bookstore. Hoping to see a good representation of Hadid's architecture, it was like looking at abstract paintings that supposedly were respresenting floor plans or something. If you're expecting a book that *clearly* depicts an architect's works, with photos, sketches, diagrams and floorplans, this book isn't quite the best book for that. It's got everything like a collage and I found myself eager to put it back on the shelf and spend more time looking for more clear and insightful books on architecture"
3,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,I really don't think Hillary got it right - The movie is all about Linda Carter and her chest - period!
3,Linda Carter = yummy,"Well, I pretty much got this for the nude scenes of a lovely and voluptuous early 1970s Linda Carter, and she certainly is a wonder of a woman! As to the rest of it, a pretty standard movie with little else of consequence going on."
3,Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw,I have always been a fan of Lynda Carter and had seen this movie back in the 70's so just thought I would buy it. It is definitely not a great movie but it is okay.
3,Tig Bitty's,"How come there are so many bad reviews for this movie, linda carter in her prime running around in skin tight outfits with no bra plus a few nude scenes with her tig bitty's is a very good reason to celebrate!"
1,WARNING,"This review is of the sellars (MEASORCALL) misleading information. The disc is a poor copy from apparently a VHS tape on a -R DVD. While it's a very difficult film to get, I suspect if you can get a VHS studio released tape, you are far, better off. Unfortunately the seller (MEASORCALL) says it's a 'Used like New' DVD. That's like saying the car is used with minor damage when describing a junk-yard 'CASH-FOR-CLUNKER' with a siezed engine. Buyer beware!"
2,Bad movie--good Lynda Carter,"Any fan of Lynda(Wonder Woman)Carter should see this movie. Little action, little plot, but a whole lot of exposure for Carter."
2,Two Big Assets,"Marjoe Gortner (preacher turned ""actor"") as wanna be Billy the Kid; Lynda Carter as a waitress who aspires to be a country singer. Greatness in the making? A CITZEN KANE for our times? No, but this stinker does have Lynda Carter's boobs on display."
1,PETTY BAD! ACTUALLY REAL BAD!!,Well what can I say? Lynda Carter was a fox for sure! Easy to look at but at that time in her career she couldn't act for beans! Digital transfer from tape is just fair...maybe it will become a cult classic some day!
2,"It's okay, But not great!","This replacement string is ok for light use, but it wears way to easily when used around driveways, walkways, and chainlink fence.I use it alot because of the cheap price."
2,A rehash of something outstanding,"Harry's second book falls prey to his own advice: the first one was so outstanding, that I expected something excellent and was disappointed with merely ""good"". Like many movie sequels, this book simply repeated themes that were great in the original, but have now grown stale. Of all authors, I was really disappointed in the blatant reuse of specific examples: the orangest orange example, the Peanuts back-of-the-shoes example. Others. I did read it cover-to-cover in one night. I did chuckle. I did enjoy the examples. But there was no blinding new insight.Having loved his original, I'm disappointed with the sequel. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was expecting it to be outstanding. This didn't have it. If you haven't read Selling the Invisible, buy that instead. If you have already read it, don't bother with Part II."
2,Broadly-stated rules,"This is a book of platitudes. Short essays lightly describe the author's observations, and end (in most cases) with a bumper-sticker-esque proverb. Sometimes these text-bites are a summary of the essay, sometimes they're a logical stretch (the first chapter, for example).There are a few insightful truths here, though. There's a good section on sacrifice in the Relationships section. Customers sacrifice a great deal to do business with you. So you're obligated to return the sacrifice even more.A good, though unstated, assumption here is that every business would do better to think of itself as a service.Ironically, one of the best sentences in the book (in the Branding section) is a reasonable critique of this book: ""...like most rules, the dying-brand rule is stated too broadly, and thus misleads us."""
4,No breakthorugh but a fun and practicl book for every marketer,"The invisible touch is not a ground breaking book that will give you new ways of tikning about the world, your job or your life. Still, it ia solid book with tons of practical real-world advise that every marketer (and business owner) can put into practice.Harry writes with many stories, making the book an easy and enjoyable read. I cannot tell you of many ""a-ha"" moments during the book, but after each reading session I had a couple things in my mind that I wanted to do differently in my job right away.The book does not make the top of my list but I still recommend it."
4,Exposes Assumptions,"He's off completely though when he gushes over his European hiking pal. What if this hiking pal was a Subway sandwich guy, instead of a 2nd year law student...? Placebo effect in full force again. It depends on ""who"" is saying your name. How many Moms wish they could change their names?What's the deal with the Carter-Reagan comparison? That wasn't even intelligent?!?!?!The greatest insight, I thought, was the discovery that people first make decisions and then seek to justify them. I can see how understanding that concept can be useful. Find out what they've decided first, and then support it or try to change it... Absolutely Brilliant!!!!! I'm soooo guilty of that one.Thanks Harry for another great treasure of insights. Didn't care for the repeat stuff from ""What Clients Love"", but you knocked a few out of the park. I'll pay to see that any time!"
3,Works OK,Worked pretty decent..Didn't keep all mosquitos away however..It's pretty expensive for the refills as well in my expreience/opinion. Not sure if I'd buy another refill at this point.
4,works ok,Seems to work ok. I need to keep these about 2 feet from my ankles or I get torn up. I think I just have sweet blood.
5,Excellent,"It really help with mosquitos and majes here on the outside near the beach, river and wetlands!!We couldn't find it anywhere here in Puerto Rico."
1,Do NOT order this item!!!!!,"The Lantern is a great item. This review is not for the item itself. It's for this Amazon listing. If you order this, you'll receive one 3 count refill, not 12 as is stated in this listing. For one, the price is average at best. I spent over $32(including shipping) for 3 boxes of 3 refills, not 36 boxes as this advertises. Don't do it! Amazon needs to correct this listing."
1,very misleading,"the product its self is great...however the ad is very misleading...it is not 83% off the price...they say 3 units which is only one box. one box sells for 6.99 regularly...which is not a discount especially not 83% off. these items will be returned and i really need them, but not for 11.10 per box!"
4,Works very well when there's no breeze.,"I have been using these lanterns for a summer now and I live in Florida, so the bugs are terrible. They generally do a good job when you use a couple of them to give you a mosquito free bubble, but if there is a breeze their effectiveness drops dramatically. For the price, they are pretty effective."
3,The best beginners book.,"If you are new at collecting, want to know if you want to collect, or just want to know about rugs, this is a good book. Takes you from the beginning and walks you through. Not a book a dealer would use, but one I would recommend for those curious. Beachum's review here on Amazon is a little too harsh in my opinion. While the price of rugs is too fluid and dependent on variables that cannot be captured in a book, there are some valuable points the pricing chapters make for the beginner. Not all rugs appreciate at the same rate. Condition and age are critical. Etc. I found the ""value factor multiplier"" interesting and roughly accurate - that is - a rank ordering of which type of rugs have appreciated faster over time than others. The focus on the economics of rug collecting was disturbing."
2,These are Short Edits of Message and Rapper's Delight,"This is the third album I've got now with a 3:xx minute version of Rapper's Delight, where I'm looking for the original 15:xx minute version. Same for The Message -- a shortened version, not the original. Booooo."
4,Wake Up,For those of you who bought this DVD to hear all the songs...wake up. The Classic Album series is about the MAKING of albums. Buy the CD of the album if you just want the music.
5,A treasure,"I've been an insane Elton John fan since I was 12. This documentary shows moments from an old ABC special that was broadcast around the late 70s. It shows my favorite scene where Elton is playing the song ""Harmony"" a pump organ outside while the band is sitting around a tree. That scene alone was worth the cost. The types of things Elton and Bernie discuss are the things I used to always want to know about. The ""process"" I guess of crafting a song. I learned a lot of things I never knew before. Goodbye Yellowbrick Road is arguably Elton's greatest album. I've always thought Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy rivaled it."
3,Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"I enjoyed this DVD but it seemed short in duration to me. I would have liked more vintage video, more interviews with Elton,etc."
1,Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.,"I had other expectations about this album ( Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road DVD), such as live music instead of interviews and cuts.I purshased ""one night only"" and I hope to be more lucky this time.Rgds.,"
1,Consumer Beware,"If you like Elton John's music, do NOT buy this dvd. Even though the title states Classic Albums, this is not a music disc, but a documentery about Elton John..."
1,public service announcement,Although I am a big fan of Barbara Michaels this was not her best book. It is one long psa for why people shouldn't do drugs. It was written in the '70's and it shows. This is the only book she has written where I skipped to the end. Characters are not well developed.
4,Four Hundred Rabbits,A bit slow at first but kept picking up speed and many interesting turns and hints that were all woven back into the story toward the ending.
3,murder I also write,Elizabeth Peters' skill as a writer is never in question but the subject was a bit out dated. I liked the protaganist and that kept me reading but I had a hard time relating to the other characters. I'll read anything by this author but this was not my favorite.
2,braothers karamazov,Music from the soundtrack of the movie was just as expected.Thank you for your prompt service.
2,"Cute costume, not great construction","This costume is really cute, especially on my 6 month-old. However, the seams weren't sewn well, and the fabric of the body suit ripped several times when the snaps were unsnapped. The two halves of the shell didn't line up either, which made for a rather interesting pattern. Overall, cute costume, but I don't think it was worth the price."
3,Cheap,We bought this for our son's first Halloween. It was adorable on him and he got lots of comments on how cute he was. It is made of cheap material (like most costumes are). It ripped in several places just from taking it on and off. But he still looked adorable so I guess that's what matters. A little pricey for such a cheap fabric.
3,"Great shipping, but poster got old","I had a gift certificate with not that much on it so I decided to buy this poster for my Dorm Room. I felt like it got stale after awhile. I have other posters, which are from movies but they dont seem to get old. Only get this if you know you will love looking at it everyday."
2,If you hate MS then this book is for you!,"I bought this book, expecting to get a serious description of Steve Ballmer, but it turns out this is just another book in the infamous serie ""We who hate/envy Microsoft!"". In this book all competitors, such as Sun, Netscape and IBM, is presented as a nice group of companies that all follow the rules, and never offend anyone. At the same time this book says muliple times that Bill G and Steve B run their business as Nazi leaders; the book does comparisons with the war criminal Slobodan Milosovic, and the author does a lot of irrelevant personal comments. This is not what I expect from a serious book - It could have been a very interesting book, if just the author was more neutral. There are a lot of other good books that explains MS and their business methods, if you are interested."
1,Where's the beef?,"I was expecting more insight. What I got was an endless series of content-free anecdotes, long descriptions of technology the author clearly doesn't understand, and a bunch of factual errors and misspellings. Don't bother."
4,A nice rehashing of the Microsoft story,"Microsoft's CEO Steven Ballmer is the subject of ""Bad Boy Ballmer"". It traces Ballmer and Gates friendship back to their days at Harvard University. It uses primarily secondary sources to give a nice rehashing of the Microsoft story. We learn of Ballmer's Jewish heritage, Detroit roots and even have a mention of Robin Williams. We learn of Ballmer's enthusiasm, tearing his vocal cords, ascension to the CEO position, and his arrogance. While technically a biography, it is more a history of Microsoft with Steve Ballmer as the focal point. Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."
4,A fun trip to Vegas,"A fun detective book, plenty of action including con games. Take a short trip to Las Vegas, the content of this book won't tax your brain too hard. The writing is very readable."
3,"A good, light read.","The period felt more like the 50's than present day, and the only really dimensional character was Tony. But this is a fun, quick, rather light read with a couple very good twists."
4,This excellent read will con you out of your evening!,"Tony Valentine has spent most of his life dealing with creeps, crumbs, crooks, con men, and other assorted low-lifes. First as a cop and now as a freelance investigator, he has used his skill at spotting scams to bust enough grifters to fill a $3.99 buffet. When casino pit bosses find the house getting taken to the cleaners by the best, they know Tony's the man to stop them.""Grift Sense"" is James Swain's first novel and it's a winner. The story is very interesting and unfolds at a well-measured, suspenseful pace. Like Elmore Leonard, Swain has the knack for creating the kind of thugs and larcenous malcontents whom you can't help but be like.This book is supposed to be the first in a series featuring Tony Valentine. I hope the author is already hard at work on the next volume because I'm looking forward to reading more."
4,Strong and confident,...describes the writing in this first of a series. Very well done with insider knowledge.
4,It's a good private detective book,"I enjoyed this novel, even though at it's heart it is just a fairly standard ex-cop detective novel. It's a nice angle to have an ex-cop who specialises in the gambling industry, particularly casino hustlers & swindlers.There are elements of humour although I would've like more. I would've also liked Swain to have written more about the casino games. There's the occasional predictable cringe worthy cliche (e.g. Valentine ripping up his boxing betting ticket) but overall it's pretty entertaining."
4,"Good Rollicking, Las Vegas Thriller","This is Swain's first Tony Valentine novel and it's a good one. The book centers around a massive scam aimed at a raggedy Las Vegas hotel casino and features characters that would do justice to Elmore Leonard or Damon Runyon. Protagonist Valentine, an aging retired Atlantic City cop and now casino consultant, is a worthy hero and provides the book's locomotion. Swain knows how to write a breezy book that keeps you rapt from page one. His knowledge of gambling and casino operations, combined with his writing ability and imagination, offers up a tale that is a delight to the reader."
4,"Good Humor, Nice Flow for first of series","I really enjoyed this book. I read 2-3 books a week. This one kept my attention. When I review a book I ask, Did it keep my interest? Does it have humor? Is it well written? Does the ending have resolve? I answered yes to all these questions after reading Grift Sense.This is the first of a series of 4. The author is also an expert on gambling. You could tell. The main character, Valentine, is likeable and funny. I can't wait to read the next one."
4,Great mix of Vegas and Mystery,I really enjoyed Swain's story of a retired cop who returns to Vegas to help capture a master con man. Swain's mix of Vegas and plot twists made it a very hard book to put down. I did not see the ending coming. Great job!
1,A Complete Waste Of Time,"Las Vegas gambling and the grifters that attempt to cheat the casinos. A book of repugnant characters doing ridiculous things. The plot is confused and uninteresting. If this is the best author Swain can do, he ought to find other employment (and so should the editor and publisher who put out this tripe)."
4,Pure Entertainment!!!,"I recently read the newest novel in the Tony Valentine series and liked it a lot. So much so that I bought all the prior ones and this book is the first in the series. You either like this type of book or you don't. Las Vegas characters, scheming, gambling and looking for the big score. Not through luck, but by design and the big score by scamming is what Tony Valentine is all about stopping. The set up to the attempt at the score is complicated and as it unfolds you're not sure that Tony's ""grift sense"" is working i.e., the ability to spot a scam. Getting to the payoff is almost as much fun as you can have with your clothes on in this wild, bawdy and very entertaining read. Mr.Swain has found his niche and those who chose to join him in the adventures of Tony Valentine will not be disappointed."
5,Loved it!,"""This is a very entertaining novel that had me guessing until the very last page. The depictions of Las Vegas are right on the money, and there were laughs on practically every page. I really enjoyed this."""
3,Urban rider reveiws the Beamer 5.,"This light takes two 'AA's so i can use rechargebles,not pricey watch batteries.The five LEDs have a good throw.When pointed a bit closer to the ground infront of the handle bars it gives off a star cluster rather than a single wash.This is a light not for seeing well but for being seen by others.The easy to install bracket does not seem to tighten enough.I wish designers would make strong metal(titanium?)brackets for lights for those of us who ride everyday,everywhere.Not the best,but better than most."
3,"..good, but some flaws","I agree about the lights not being very bright with rechargeable batteries, although I haven't tried alkalines. They are bright enough to be seen, and to ride in the city, but if one wanders away from city lights and there isn't any moonlight to be found, one must be very careful about not running off of a path or running over road debris.Also, another comment noted that the bracket not being tight enough - I have also found this an issue. When I go over big bumps, the light falls forward.Other Planet Bike stuff is excellent, but this leaves a bit to be desired.Edit: Tried new alkalines versus charged ni-mh batteries. The alkalines were substantially brighter. I guess the .3 volts per battery makes a (big)difference."
5,Excellent light for city riding,"This is a great light for city riding. It is bright and has a long battery life. The mount is secure and has a quick release so you can take the light with you. The body is waterproof and opens without tools, plus it is very compact. What more do you need?"
4,decent light...,The light is bright enough I suppose although my only gripe is that the bracket mount's clamp doesn't snap securely shut into place. It only closes but doesn't give me the assurance that it's snug.
3,"Good light, bad mount","The light part of this item is alright. It doesn't illuminate things 30 feet away, and honestly I find the advertisement picture pretty ridiculous, but it lets me ride my bike at night well enough. And for $24 I'm not going to complain.The real annoyance is that the mounting bracket's minimum diameter is larger than my BMX bike's horizontal handlebar. I've had to stick some filler rubber between the bar and the mount to get it to stay on.Besides these issues, though, the light is fairly solid and cheap. I really like the ability to pop the light on and off the bracket to use as a flashlight, or in case you don't want to take off the entire mount if you leave your bike outside."
4,Does the job!,"I'd recently bought a head light from Target and used it to commute to work,was almost hit by a car due to fog! This headlight cuts through fog and allows oncoming traffic to notice you. If you have poor vision and you need a headlight to see 20ft out, this is not the light for you. If you need a light to be seen, can't beat this unit! It only has two lighting options but for the price I'm not complaining. I feel you pay for what you get!"
2,"Good visibility, poor fastening device","This works very well in terms of providing light. It's bright and very visible. I feel safer riding with it.The big problem is that the piece which attaches it to the handlebars is difficult to adjust tightly if you have any bend in your bar. Mine perpetually slumps forward.The connection between the light and ring, however, is great. I'm confident the light will stay on, but it's easy to remove in a hurry."
5,Nice bright light!,"A nice bright light! Haven't used it yet, but will use it going through tunnels on our bikes. Mounts easily to handlebars."
3,Not as bright as I would have liked.,"The light gets the job done. I was riding in darkness, and it came in handy for me to see what I was riding on. I would have liked it to be a hair brighter though as the light didn't shoot very far on non reflecting surfaces. The cool thing though is when you have it flashing, you can see things flashing in the distances. Pretty helpful if you're coming up on stationary objects in the distances.However, if you plan to ride at night often in areas not well lit, I would go for the brighter option."
3,Good light ... Poor switch,This light worked fine for a while (in fact it still works).After a while the rubber covering the switch mechanism gave way perhaps due to exposure to the elements.I now have to fiddle in the hole to operate the light.Guess i'm done with PLANET!
2,Two Out of Three Have Failed,"We have bought three, and two have failed. They worked great until they died, but I won't be buying any more. The problem seems to be the switch."
3,Why is this light rated so highly?,"This light is okay, but not great. I was disappointed that it is not brighter. Also the ""quick cam"" mount is kind of silly. The light has a quick release for removing it from the mount. Why does the mount also need a quick release to remove it from the bike? Answer: it doesn't. And the quick cam lever is a bit fussy. I returned this light and bought a Bell Lumina Bike Light Set for about the same price at Waal Maart. The Bell is noticeably brighter, has a better mount, uses 3 AA batteries (instead of 2 in the Planet Bike) so run time will be longer, and comes with a nice taillight."
2,Not bright at all,"I've been using this light for about a year now and it is not worth the money I spent on it. It is a bike that will let cars see you, but that is pretty much it. I ride in a fairly dark area, and if I ride more than 4mph, I can't see a thing. The mount is also poorly designed and never seems tight.The only real benefits to this light are that it is cheap, and it uses AA batteries, which can be found pretty much anywhere, and the battery life is good.If you need a light that will actually help you see, look elsewhere."
4,Very visible,"I have had this light for about 2 months and use it about every day. It does a wonderful job of making you more visible to oncoming traffic, although its ability to illuminate the road ahead is limited. It doesn't seem to go through the batteries too quickly as it still looks as bright as the first time I used it. Installation was fairly simple. In conclusion, I would recommend this product as long as you realize that it is more about making you visible than it is about illuminating the road."
4,Shine a light,"Well, the light was a bit loose on the bar, but that is easily dealt with. I got about 11 hours out of the original battery on the shine function. You could probably get a lot more on the strobe option, but flashing lights can cause seizures for some people with certain medical conditions. But, I'm not your mother. Do whatever you want. I am a slow biker, at about 12 miles an hour, and the light lit my path at a sufficient distance and is easily visible to uncoming traffic, although I also recommend additional blinking red lights and reflectors for those dumb enough to be biking in the dark. An adequate and inexpensive safety device for my bike. The light removes easily for battery replacement. Recommended."
4,Like the light,"The 5 LED light has good illumination, and is terrific at getting the attention of motorists and pedestrians. However, it interferes with my wireless speedometer. When it is turned on to a steady state it locks it at zero. When it is set to flash it shows random numbers up to 43 mph. A great light all in all."
4,Nice and bright,"I really enjoy this light, but feel like I could use a second. I know a lot of people here in Portland who only use this as their front bike light and it works great: nice and bright. For the price, I really don't think that it can be beat.That said, however, it could use to have a bigger face to make the light spread a little larger and be cut farther open on the sides so cars approaching laterally can see the biker more easily.Still, it's a great light!"
1,Well ... i'm very disappointed!,"First of all sorry for my english. I have installed the CD immediately after have get it. And what ? a protection that work as a web server , encripted files etc. ok , i start the CD and i found that this server that they create on you computer is SLOW, DAMN SLOW , seems to be in internet when is lagged! Sometime the server don't work and don't find the page. At least , tutorials are really simple , too much simple. They don't cover some steps during the tutorials, and you look at the page and your 3dsmax wondering what to do. At least you have the demo scenes to look , you can Download them but ... but ... they aren't on the CD! the server ( i hate it ) say , ""temporaly removed"". Oh right, i have to wait the webmaster of this 'server' to update the links .... nahhh! i have throw my money out of the windows unfortunately."
1,Frustrated,"I am writing this after a full day of trading emails with support. I keep sending answers to the same questions every email. It makes me wonder if they are even reading them. I will give it one more try. If that doesn't work, it's getting shipped back. I can only hope the tutorials are more user friendly then the installation process."
3,jury still out,I put a K&N in my '90 Celica Turbo All-Trac years ago for it's performance gain but bought one for the Escape for a mileage boost. Have not run enough tanks of gas through it for meaningful assessment yet but remain hopeful.
3,"Meh, It's OK","It's small and thin, and didn't have the effect I was looking for. It would work on a smaller cake, but we had 4 square tiers. I ended up getting a different cake topper from a different website that we absolutely loved. Will try to return this item."
3,Should be in red,"We used it as the cake topper for our wedding cake because our families are not very traditional. But traditionally, the double happiness symbol is always in red. In fact, some elders may be offended because it is silver/a shade near white because that's not appropriate for weddings."
5,fantastic!,"I loved this book! I have Dee's other 2 books, but this is the one I have enjoyed the most (though I also liked the others). It is exciting, fast-paced with all kinds of plot twists that left me guessing until the end. I really enjoyed the setting of Vienna. It's such an unusal choice, but it doesn't overwhelm the story. The heroine, Chloe, is spunky and charming, with just enough faults to make her believable and real. Who wouldn't love a messy, accident-prone heroine who ends up in the lap of a dead man?!! The hero, Matthew, is wonderful as well. He is sensitive, but not wimpy. Strong, but not overbearing. Down to earth, but still glamorous (and very sexy). I reccomend this book to anyone who loves a romantic, suspensful, quirky romance novel. It is fresh and fun!"
5,FABULOUS!,"I loved this book. It's set in Vienna, Austria and has it all. Heart-rending romance, Belly-buster comedy, Spine-tingling suspense, all wrapped up in a beautiful setting that is far from the norm. Ms. Davis has done it again. I can't wait for her next book!"
2,"sorry, don't get the attraction","I bought this book after the glowing reviews here but have to say I'm seriously disappointed. I didn't feel like the characters jumped out of the pages, the heroine was irritating- the author was going for funny and quirky and it never really worked. And the romantic scenes were just plain boring with absolutely no heat. When an author needs to use lines like `riding the stars together' they should just stick to suspense. If you want a story with a good amount of humor, vivid characters and some passion read something by Susan Donovan or Charlaine Harris."
3,Boring...,"I've read Dancing In The Dark & After Twilight by Dee Davis & Just Breathe doesn't even come close to the other 2. I found the book to be pretty boring & I didn't totally follow the whole conspiracy thing. I got the main idea of the conspiracy but it was basically laid all out for you therefore there wasn't much of a mystery. I'm finding that Dee likes using the same expressions over in over, not just in 1 book but from book to book. Examples would be ""Let me love you"" & ""the smile didn't quite reach his eyes"". Also, I'm left still wondering about the cow story. Was it ever really explained? I love Dee Davis books but Just Breathe is one that I can't recommend."
3,Too many under-developed sub-themes,"This book had a good story line and was entertaining. However, the author had a tendency to place story threads in the book that were never integrated into the plot. She wrapped the book up too quickly to do justice to the threads. Cynically, I would guess she was trying to do some marketing for a multi-book series. Or, she needed a better editor.Bottom Line: A good read for those who don't get bothered by poor editing. But for those who also like well-crafted books, may want to pass on this one."
2,Missed,"I evidently missed out on something, because I could not get into this book. I tried - read half way thru and ended up just putting it in the bag for the book exchange. I wasn't even interested in finding out the ending. Sorry, but this is one I cannot recommend to read."
5,It Worked for Me!!,"I lost six pounds in eleven days. I started out taking one-half pill in the morning and one-half in the afternoon. I was wary of any reaction. I now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon. That's enough for me. I have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise. No side effects whatsoever. My problem was the munchies at night watching TV -- and that craving is gone. I highly recommend this product!It is now the end of October, and I have lost over 30 pounds! Of course, I have exercised and am eating the right foods. But I could not have done it without my morning pill of Trimspa. I highly recommend it!"
1,more like a 1.5... but not quite a 2,"it's more like a 1.5... not quite a 2..., July 4, 2006Reviewer: Castle Gate Studio - See all my reviewsTrimspa doesn't do much.... but it helps a little bit... I've used it in conjunction w/slimfast (because alone it really didn't do anything).... it helped me get from slimfast to slimfast feeling ""hungry"" instead of ""famished.""The good thing is you don't get sick or jittery at all. If you need a little help, this might be the trick. If you are looking for more than that, you can either clean out your diet to the max and kick up your work-outs, or find a more effective product (and post it here so we can all benefit)."
3,Trimspa X32 only so so...,"At first it really did prevent any hunger pangs, and I didn't feel full, but did not feel hungry. I was encouraged. But after a week or so, it did not appear to work as well. Some days it worked, and others seemed to have no effect at all. I did notice that my heart rate appeared to be slightly elevated, which might be due to the caffeine in the product."
3,Doesn't Work,"Doesn't contain my hunger, I workout so I get hungry so this doesn't even curb it or give me energy. Occasinally if I side track my mind it kicks in, but otherwise I am going back to Stacker for the energy."
1,Did less than nothing for me.,I took this on a low fat diet for one month at the maximum dosage and got nothing but sleepless nights for my trouble. I ended up having to shell out for 2 bottles to give this a decent try at the full dosage and even dropping down to the minumum dose didn't help with the sleeplessness. I wasn't snacking and was eating small portions on my strict diet and managed to GAIN weight. I think I can safely say that this product is absolute garbage.
2,expiration dates please,"I've used this product off and on for a few years, and find it useful in getting a jump start in trying to lose weight. I ordered three months worth of this stuff in december, only to find out that they all expired in february (less than 2 months away).The product is useful, but i certainly don't appreciate not being able to even finish the second bottle."
2,Placebo?,I seriously don't think these pills do anything. Maybe they're just a placebo experiment and the only effect they really have is making you THINK they are helping control cravings.
1,Wrong set,Sockets are great if you need a metric set.unfortunalty I needed a sae set and that was what I ordered. Oh well
4,Chritmas DVD-A,This DVD-A sounds good and it was a nice traditional collection. It was great to have playing around the tree.
1,Disappointing Wilson Product,"I bought this sports net less than 8 months ago and used it about once a week during baseball season. It never stayed outside in the elements and was always stowed away when it wasn't used. Around the first month or so, the fabric where the poles were inserted (from end to end) began tearing, at about the seventh month the fiberglass poles began splitting, and at around the eigth month the elastic cord attached to one of the pole ends snapped rendering the entire product unusable."
5,Easy to read and even entertaining!,"I bought this because it was a prescribed text for one of my university classes. I was suprised at how easy it is to read and stay interested in it; the author writes just as if he was standing there teaching you the programming language and he injects his own humour into it. The language itself if pretty easy, too. I wish my other textbooks were as pleasant to read as this one."
3,Not Viewable in the Kindle for Mac,Kindle version of this book is not viewable on the Kindle for Mac. This is kind of ordinary. I did not realize that some books would only be viewable on the kindle itself.Disappointing.
2,Disappointed,"Major knock on this book are the exercises. Some of the exercises were ridiculously hard, had to search on the internet to resolve some of them since the chapters themselves gave very basic information on how to solve some of those problems."
2,Not very good,"I think there were some errors in this book. I do know it was rather distressing in a way.The book is full of lessons, and I always wondered exactly where they were going with them.. what were they going to accomplish? Everything seems so unfinished in the book.I recall a lot of emphasis on games... I don't care about games.I have a Macintosh computer, and use Poser. I am distressed because some Poser-related utilities don't come in Macintosh versions. I thought I'd try to learn Python and write some of my own.I gave up after less than 100 pages. I think these people are so caught up in their own knowledge that they forget to see things through the eyes of rank beginners who are desperate to learn programming.This book joins a collection of other books that are truly disappointing."
4,great fro the beginner,"I actually started with the O'reilly books and they are great, but if your new to programming/scripting, this book is a better place to start. It will get you up and running with Python fast. yeah, its easy, but I think that's the point (hence the title ""Absolute Beginners""). The exercises are fun and get the concepts across very well. If you've mastered other languages, go with O'reilly. if you are new to coding start with this book."
4,Good Beginner's Book,"I'm new to programming, python is my first language to learn. This book does a good job on getting the beginner started in programming, however it does not go into to much detail and the book does jump around a lot. But as i said it is a good book for the absolute beginner, but if you want to go in to detail and understand things better i would recommend a different book."
3,the pendulum swings back,"As the pendulum of politics swings once again to the right, it reflects a glow from the halos of George W. and by political relation, Ronald Regan. I found this book to be interesting, yet only underscoring the simple-mindedness of a man who, while trying to construct great ideas for our country, only served the elite-class what they wanted and cast our country into un-paralleled debt and an even greater financial/social descrepancy between the haves and have-nots. Publishers eager for a buck will publish this sort of stuff while the right is on a media upswing."
3,Interesting Insights,"This collection, largely drawn from radio transcripts of Reagan's mid-1970s speeches, gives some interesting insights into Reagan which dispel both the assumptions of the right and the left. Liberals will be surprised to see that, before his presidency at least, Reagan had an active role in a wide range of policy formulations. Conservatives, however, will be humbled to see just how stubbornly wrong-headed Reagan was on a number of issues. Enough here to please (or displease) people of every political stripe."
2,Not Terribly Illuminating Material,"84% of the book is Reagan's handwritten drafts of his radio punditry from 1975 to 1979. Reagan liked to take a small selection of what for him amounted to fact and build a conservative argument around it. Sometimes it's convincing, sometimes it's less so, but nearly always it's pretty boring stuff. Reagan's genius was his simple vision of what America could be if it stopped apologizing for itself. The way he energized his staff to that end when he became President is the real story of his uniqueness (George Shultz' Foreword is perhaps more illuminating in this respect). The material in this book does little to advance our understanding of that uniqueness. And of course wading through the crossed-out prose and the bad spellings merely becomes tedious after awhile. It might be excellent for Reagan groupies or serious historians, but it is hardly great reading fare for the rest of us."
4,The importance of this book is that it exists,"The importance of this book is that it exists. Many to this day, still consider Reagan an amiable dunce, or an actor just reading what other more capable people wrote for him and doing what others told him.This book proves them wrong. It proves that before he was president, Reagan was writing and delivering speeches almost daily. Speeches that he wrote himself on a wide range of issues of the day. It shows that his Presidency reflected HIS positions, HIS beliefs.The collection of speeches are interesting. Reagan's style is interesting. I like seeing the original wording choices he wrote, and then his edits to the final speech. Always to convey an idea in a better way, not changing the idea.It's hard to float this amiable dunce idea when hundreds of pages of Reagan's handwritten speeches prove that wrong."
1,Does not cling!,"If you are looking for a good clingy plastic food wrap, steer away from this product. This wrap does not function contrary to what is advertised on the box. It does not stick to glass, nor does it stick to itself even if you pat it down.I highly recommend the following products instead. These brands' food wrap provide strong, instant cling for a tight seal:- Reynolds plastic wrap- Kirkland (Costco brand) plastic food wrap- First Street (Smart & Final brand) plastic food wrap"
1,Slide N Cut bar is awful,"Saran brand plastic wrap is normally pretty decent, but the slide n cut bar that they have on the latest packages is an atrocity probably illegal under the Geneva Convention. It is pretty much impossible to get the slide bar to cut any plastic wrap and utterly infuriating. The normal blade that's usually on these boxes is replaced with the bar, which makes cutting plastic wrap more difficult than giving a cat a bath. Avoid the slide n cut bar at all costs, I ended up using scissors."
5,The best I've tried,"I use plastic wrap every day, at least once. I've tried lots of different ones over the decades. I like all the characteristics of the classic (original) except that it tears way too easily; if it was strong and otherwise the same, it would be my favorite, but as it is, the Premium is the best I've found so far."
2,Yes & No,"We bought two units and a boombox. The first unit is still going strong after 1 1/2 years has been moved from vehicle to vehicle. The second unit was spotty from the start. It really had issues after was used in the boombox for only the second time. Now there is a short and it has not been right since. Buyer beware. SIDE NOTE we also have a Starmate and it is has been replaced TWICE in less than a year. The first time it just wouldn't get any reception and the second time the antenna broke off with minimal wear and tear. It was bought from Sirius and they have stood behind the product, but you pay for shipping and are without a radio."
4,Works for me!,I bought this unit from Amazon for $46 and I use it daily at work. I drive a garbage truck and the unit gets a good shaking from me picking up and emptying up to 1000 bins each day. The unit does run hot but it has worked faultlessly despite hitting the floor a couple of times
3,Recommended buy before you purchase your Bengal.,"The book is worth purchasing for the stunning photography itself. There are some tips and helpful information, but I've found more detailed information from breeders websites. Books on Bengals are not available as yet in Australia, so not sure how this compares to others, but I doubt breeders nor people wishing to show their cat would learn more than what they already know from this book. Recommended to the pet buyer who wants some basic info on habits, care, growth stages and beautiful photos of a range of Bengal coat patterns."
5,Great Book !!! Very Informative !!!,"After recently purchasing a Bengal kitten, I found this book to be well written and very informative. Interesting to read about the Bengal's history, breeding and character. Great color photos of the different types of Bengal cats !!!"
4,Great Present,My mothers favorite. Arrived ahead of time. No damage to box or bottle. EDP spray is a bit stronger then the TS.
2,club visuals Vol 2 review,"This is a great visuals dvd with some cool graphics, however i was not aware that there is a scene on there that depicts two girls kissing. its not a short scene either. Im not able to use this dvd for the event i bought it for because of that. There should be a list of contents, or ratings available so people can see what they are buying before they buy it. They should make a preview of this dvd, and make sure they put the girls kissing in that preview. for what it is overall, its expensive and is not worth the money."
3,Not the Poster I Remember,"This poster is really not representative of this outstanding film. FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of the most underrated film epics of all time. However, this poster does not capture any of the epic. It does capture images of the cast very similar to that used on the original soundtrack album."
5,Great lantern,"I have a smaller back packing lantern from Coleman, so I decided to by the larger one. I was not disappointed, since it is a dual fuel, I am not dependent upon buying only white gas for it. As usual, great service from Amazon."
5,Coleman Duel Fuel Lantern,"Coleman dual fuel LanternThis lantren meet all the requirements that I needed in a emergency light.It is brite in the dark of night, runs on more that one fuel.In a true emergency the Unleaded gas would be much easyier to obtain the the white gas that is used in most Colman lanterns at a price far below than white gas.I would suggest that everyone have one in their home, should it be needed when the lights go out."
1,Sorry Product,"My lantern worked twice, and hasn't since. Too much hassle returning and waiting, so I will limit my online shopping. Do not buy this item.Larry Sutton"
4,Decent look at the beginning of Priest's commercial period.,"This is an ok entry in the Classic Albums series. Not great, that accolade is reserved for Classic Albums - Machine Head and Number of the Beast. Those two are examples of how to do this thing right. The Judas Priest is enjoyable enough, but lacking in the extras that made the other two so remarkable."
4,Classic Albums Vids,"I am becoming a big fan of these Classic Album dvds. This one was a recent gift to brother and I have yet to get any feedback from him. I own the ones on Queen's ""A Night At The Opera"", Zappa's ""Apostrophe""&""Over-Night Sensation"" and Jimi's ""Electric Ladyland"". I love all three although the Hendrix dvd isn't quite as indepth as the other two."
1,NOT GOOD,After watching this once you never want to watch it again. The stories are interesting but there is too much interview and not enough music !!!
2,British Steel,OK if you are a die hard Priest fan. All the dialog is a bit boring. It moves a little too slow for me. The music was good though.
1,a MUST HAVE disk!,"If you haven't heard this one, you've been under a rock for the last 22 years... This disk floored me the first time I heard it waaay back in 1980, and it still kicks some major a--.... From the first snare drum smack from then new drummer Dave Holland to start 'Breaking The Law', all the way through to the power chords from Glenn and KK closing the disc at the end of 'Steeler', this is THE BEST metal disc out there!"
2,Superficial and disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book which I expected to add new insights into some different ways that women survived Auschwitz. From some of the excerpts I had read, I felt that this book might offer a deeper more emotional introspection of the women survivors that were interviewed. Unfortunately, this book was superficial, the personal stories were outlined with little detail, and included little emotional material. Coping methods of survivors were indicated, but it was difficult to understand how the author's conclusions were reached. Don't waste your money."
4,Will read again and again,"A wonderful book on a sad topic but will read again,these women were truly heroic"
2,Price is too hefty.,"I bought this many years ago for 10 dollars at a WalMart. The fact that someone thought it'd be wise to post this up for 1,000 is ridiculous.While the dvd is a great watch, the price is not nearly worth it. Even for a collector.Don't trust the price. Find something better priced."
2,Lackluster.,"There were a couple of nice tracks on this album. However, a couple of nice tracks does not make a good album. I used to listen to Groove Radio when it was on the air in LA. It always struck me at how odd it was that the station played some fairly inaccessible tracks. Sweedish Egil has once again shown his lust for obscurity and inaccessibility on this CD. Egil once again shows his inabillity to read his audience, or even find them."
5,I LOVE THIS THING!,"I love this product! I am a professional photographer and am short so I always have a problem with harsh shadows in all the wrong places when I shoot flash on camera. Not any more! I now consider this a ""must have"" gear and will not shoot an event without it."
2,Disappointed,The book was not as good as I thought it would be. It was written in poetry form which was fine. The main characters hardly interacted with each other. At the end of the book I was thinking...THAT'S IT?!?!
5,Amazing!,"When I read this book, I was immediately entranced. The topic of discussion in this book tugged at the very bottom of my heart. The girl is this book reminds me of well, me. Everything that happened to her happened to minus the prrgnancy. Awesome book. Definately recommend."
2,Cool alternative to dissection but...,My children both enjoyed putting this model together but once you do it kind of loses it's appeal. However it was a very educational experience and a great alternative to dissecting a real one!
3,fun...for about 10 minutes,"My children ages 12 and 8 received this last year for Christmas. They really enjoyed this for a short time. Once they had disected it several timas and had touched all the rubbery parts, they grew bored with it. Their friends would play with it enthusiastically when at our house, but again, only for a short while. I ended up donating the toy to the 4th grade teacher who was thrilled to have it in her classroom. The toy is well made, so it should stand up to classroom use."
1,Gift,This Item was purchased as a gift for my Daughter in Colorado. It turns out it was not what she really wanted. She contacted the company that the Item was purchased from and could not exchange it. They wanted a 30% fee for restocking. I purchased the item on Dec 4th to make sure I could get it to my Daughter for Christmas. With all of the snow it arrived late.The bottom line is that the company would not help her out so she is going to try to sell the item on EBAY.I cannot give this item a proper rate because the Item was not me but a gift for my Daughter. She could not use it nor could she return it for credit for something else.
2,Not really USB2.0,"Like the 512MB and 1GB players in this line, Centon bills this player as a ""Full Speed USB2.0"" device. A little research will show that ""Full Speed"" actually means the same speed as USB1.1 (12mbps) - what people usually think of as ""USB2"" is actually called ""Hi-Speed"" and is 480mbps, 40x faster.USB1.1 speeds are too slow for a unit with 2GB of storage - they're barely acceptable with a 512MB unit. (Imagine having a 2GB flash drive that could only read and write at USB1.1 speeds - that's basically the situation with this.)In this unit's defense, like the 512MB model, it's got more bells and whistles than a similar iPod shuffle - but the USB1.1 speeds are a real deal-breaker."
1,Terrible user interface--not worth it,"I got this because it was cute and inexpensive. However, I agree with all of those who criticize the user interface; it is so exceptionally bad that I never use it. For instance, right now, it is playing the first 5 seconds of every song and I can't figure out why. Yeah, sure, I could look it up, but you know what? I don't care enough. I have other things to do in my life than wrestle with this little object. I recommend the Creative Muvo over this, without qualification."
1,Will not last,"I bought this mixer about 1 years ago. It LOOKS reliable , heavy, with a lot of steel built into it. It is everything but reliable. Built to last till the end of the warranty period, not a day longer. All that steel is to make sure no-one will be able to take it apart to fix it, or to see that the internal power transmission parts are made from cheap plastic."
1,Broke on first mix,Received a model #2346 Heritage Mixmaster as a gift and tried it for the first time this morning to make dough. Looks like the gears inside stripped within the first minute. Mixer s/be okay if you need to beat eggs only............disappointing such poor quality
1,Sunbeam MixMaster 4.5 Qt. Stand Mixer,"Very poor performance, only slightly better than a hand mixer. After 5 minutes mixing cake icing, the body and beaters got so hot I was unable to touch them. The unit smelled like it was about to catch fire.If you need a heavy-duty mixer, go Kitchen Aid"
1,mixer,"I bought this mixer from sears 6 months ago, it is now junk. The motor runs but the beaters don't turn. I emailed Sunbeam and they have not bothered to email me back."
1,Disappointed. :(,"I received this mixer as a gift. (If I had a receipt, I'd be demanding a refund from someone!) The problem with mine is one of the beaters falls out during mixing. When it drops from the locked position, there's a god-awful clanking noise because it starts to collide with the other beater in an unintended way. I have to stop, push it back in, and start again. It would happen about every 60 seconds at first, then I tried replacing the beaters by ordering a new (overpriced) pair on the Sunbeam website, but it got worse. Now it happens so frequently, I can't use the mixer at all."
4,Sunbeam mixer,"Product was written as a new product with nothing wrong. Also that the box was opened but everything was there.The turn table was broken and the included cd was missing.I tried, on line, to replace the turn table but was unsuccessful. Finally someone was nice enough to tell me they don't make that particular part anymore. I came to the conclusion that they had many complaints. Needless to say I can't replace the turntable. It seems there is no compatible part.I did send an e-mail to where I got it from but have not heard from them as of yet.I certainly would hesitate to buy from them again."
5,I Absolutely Love Mine,"I was so totally surprised to see the reviews on this mixer. I have owned mine for 2 years and couldn't live without. I have made over 100 pumpkin rolls, and dozens of cakes without any issues. (It's what I do to stay home with my Kids)It hasn't let me down for 2 years and it's still going strong. I have an order for 10 pumpkin rolls for Thanksgiving and this mixer will be doing all the work not me. I Absoulutely Love Mine and Couldn't do without it."
3,Product need accessory,"Product initially performs as well as my old Sunbeam Mixer i have been using for 40 years, although my old mixer came with 2 bowls, large and small. The Heritage series comes with only one bowl (stainless). If you are a regular cake baker,you can see the disadvantage of a single bowl. The person who designed this was not thinking of the user. If you bake SPONGE CAKE and CHIFFON CAKE you definitely need a big and small bowl. Without the two bowls the abovementioned cakes will come out like cement;take it from a home economist with 50 years experience. Josie has been advert5ising your Mixmaster for the past 50 years. With your new model, she will stop advertising your product unless you make the necessary change."
5,Beale Street Blues at it's very best!,"We walked into a music store on Beale St. in Memphis and heard this album playing. When my little boy walked in, he saw this older man moving to the music and trying to get him to join him. My son looked at him like he was an alien, but when Clyde Hopkins started singing along to his own music, my son started singing too. We love every cut on this album and really enjoyed meeting Clyde Hopkins. He embodies the true blues. He doesn't overdo anything, just has the rhythm and natural feel for the music. He has it all and so does this album. I only wish we could get more of his music!"
4,Better than the Video,The director's cut on DVD is so much better than the video. This is the story of seven college friends who come together for the Bris of one couple's baby. Some of them haven't seen each other in fifteen years. They spend the weekend in the house where they spent their radical college years reminiscing about the past and dealing with old baggage. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Maria and Josie. It's an enjoyable Lesbian movie
5,Memories of a simpler time,"I recently received Mothers and Daughters at home as a gift. I've only begun to read the opening chapters and it has brought back so many wonderful momories of my grandmother. She was my ""craft"" mentor. Mothers and Daughters is more than just a 'How to' book, for me it is a book of memories of a simpler time. I look forward to beginning my first project with my grandaughter!"
5,Wonder Cleaner,"I have been using Clearasil Daily Face Wash for about 2 or 3 years and am wonderfully happy with the results! This cleaner washes away dirt, oil, and grime but does not leave my face dry or painful. I also noticed a marked reduction in blemishes - and they return if I stop using the product. The only problem I have is that I can only purchase this item on Amazon.com as it is not to be found in any local drugstore, grocery store, or retailer. I highly recommend this cleaner to those with sensitive skin."
1,lied about product,"This product is a bait and switch scam. They say there are 12 bottles and then they email you and say theres only one and they say, oops we wrote the wrong description. But they never fix it. Beware OF THIS SCAM"
1,"WRONG ITEM, WRONG DESCRIPTION, WRONG PRICE","THIS ITEM HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WRONG, IN PICTURE AND NAME IT SAYS ""OFF SKINTASTIC 12 BOTTLES OF 6OZ""ACTUALLY I RECEIVED "" OFF FAMILYCARE 1 BOTTLE OF 6OZ""THIS SHOULD BE DELETED ASAP"
4,Lisle 41500 Pickle Fork Kit,"I have owned this kit for 4+ years now, and the kit has proved to be a usefull tool. Recently I broke one of the forks and havent been able to find a replacement single fork. I see the kits all over the net but I cant seem to find replacement parts."
4,Rough and ready,"Not used in anger yet but seem okay, more of there if needed tool for me.Casting quality is not bad and much better than some I have seen.The conincal base on the shafts means that the forces is NOT transmitted via the thread which is good.The pnematic hammer shaft fits my generic hammer okay.As a side note there is a debate if pickle forks are good to use, generally they can damage the joint so best to replace.Use a bolt type UJ splitter if you have to re-use parts."
5,Nice kit,"Nice kit have yet to use it, I know it will work for what I need it to do when I need to use it."
5,WOW,wow this package arrived so quick i wasnt even expecting but i definetly recommend buying from this seller
5,Pre WWII style acoustic blues lives on,"Listen to Bad Juju. Strong, crisp, skilled fingerstyle guitar. If you are a fan of acoustic fingerstyle blues, you'll want to check this one out."
5,"great harmonies, great music!","fun, great music with great vocals. the voices blend impeccably!! try it, you'll love it! oh and yes, I'm biased - I'm one of the Boogie Woogie Babies, but really, you'll love it!"
5,reminds me of the fourseasons.,"cd was in good shape for used and i enjoyed most of the song selection also, most 'new ' cd's cost a bloody fortune but, this one was reasonable and i'm happy with it!"
4,Wonderful CD,This CD helps me to complete my library of great music of a wonderful era in American history. A must CD for a collector and a great group of musicians
2,Needs to be revised,"I wish I had looked at the pub date more carefully before ordering this book. FMFM hasn't been revised, so all of the forms are outdated and therefore, useless. Some of the info is helpful, but who needs information that 6 years old?"
4,good old time science fiction,"I like this old-time science fiction because it has a lot of science speculation - something that seems to be missing from some of the most recent examples of this genre. This is something of a thriller-suspense ""mystery"" novel. It is a fun as well as a fast read. It involves a mutant species which can ingest another species and mimic its DNA causing all kinds of havoc. A group of scientists and one young policemen solve the mystery - actually quite exciting in a quaint sort of way..."
4,Stylish biography,"Nick Tosches demythologizes Ali along with Liston in this eccentric yet readable biography. Mr. Tosches elucidates on Liston's beginnings, his major bouts and downfall. He also sheds verisimilitude on Ali's two fixed victories over Liston. This book is not for those who are looking for a straight, dull biography of Liston."
3,sonny and the mob,i didnt love this book but didnt hate it either. i wish the book would have dived into the intricacies of the fights much more.
3,Eddie Machen,Eddie Machen did not run from Sonny Liston as Mr. Tosches maintains. I saw the fight on televsion and what was clear that Machen by going side to side and backward was trying to get Liston to swing over and and wide of him so Machen could counter. I thought it worked but the judges didn't. But Machen didn't run. There's nothing in boxing which says you have to stand infront of your opponent.
3,"A fine mood piece, but lacking as hard biography","A study of the short, mysterious, brutal and strange life of Charles Sonny Liston. Tosches is an erudite writer; his vivid, poetic prose propels his narrative along, even when as a detective biographer he goes out on a limb. It's fact that Liston was in with the Mob, but that it's a given in this book that Liston's two fights to Ali were fixed is a little preseumptious - but only a little. Tosches has a wealth of interviews and solid evidence at his disposal; that and his moody, evocative prose keeps his story going. At times, the book meanders too much into mini-bios of Mob figures and peripheral boxing people, and skips too quickly over important events in Liston's life (his fights with Ali and the media hype preceding them, for example). On the whole, though, this is a finely-crefted and important look into, not so much Liston's shadowy life, but the shadowy world that he inhabited."
1,Oh...the drama!,"I struggled through this book, reading painful page after painful page. If it were not for my personal interest in Sonny Liston, I would not have made it through. And at the end of it all, I was left feeling cheated, uninformed, and ANGRY (I felt similarly after seeing ""Showgirls""). Now, in my mind, Nick Tosches owes me some time.Tosches tries too hard. Tosches mistakes melodrama for poeticism.I'll recap the meat of the text for you here and now:Sonny Liston grew up poor. Sonny Liston became a criminal. Sonny Liston learned to box. Sonny Liston was really feared. Sonny Liston was connected to the mob. Sonny Liston died of heart failure. The End.Avoid this one."
3,Oops,"It is obvious here that Nick Tosches got too hung up trying to write a tough guy biography in a fast paced beat. Unfortunalty, Nick runs out of steam before he bumps into Liston. With no footnotes and lots of quotes, the research teeters on the edge of unreliabilty. To me, Tosches attempts to emulate Rick Hornung's unique writing style, but forgets to put in the neccessary (yes tedious) effort of checking and crosschecking references. It's too bad. The Devil and Sonny Liston could have been a great book."
2,Where was the editor?,"This book contains some good information, but I had to struggle to extract it. It was not particularly well organized, and the illustrations and chartts frequently confused rather than clarified. With a good editor the book would have been 30% smaller and 100% easier to read."
5,"""Enchanting""!",I abosolutley enjoyed this book as much as I have enjoyed all Miss Read's books. There is a calming and peaceful effect this book has on readers. This book makes you feel good and wish you could live in Thrush Green forever!
3,Patrice O'Neal Review,O'Neal's has some funny material on insight into race relations and personal relationships. He also used the audience to spark some very funny and embarrassing moments. This show was about 70 minutes of raw comedy.
4,Stone Face,"the extras with ""StoneFace"" was brutal and funny. I enjoyed it all. If you like Patrice then I suggest you snag this."
1,Another comic using the lowest common denominator.,Another comic using the lowest common denominator. By the way I'm no saint. I just think the best comdey is about things I have not already thought about.
1,Could not get past the first 10mins,He goes on and on and on and on about this couple in the crowd saying the same thing over and over again. I had to turn it off because I was bored to tears within 10mins.
1,Find something else,"Racially obsessed rant for first 15 minutes. Maybe there was another topic eventually, but I turned it off. Other things can be funny."
5,Patrice was a funny man,We lost Patrice O'Neal way too early. He had an insight on people and life that was truly amazing. R.I.P. Patrice!!
5,RIP Patrice O'Neal,"This is one of the funniest comedians of this time. I hate he had to leave this earth so early. This DVD of Patrice O'Neal is the best stand-up I've seen in quite some time. I highly reccommend it for any comic enthusiest. Plus, proceeds go to his family."
5,Elephant in the Room,Patrice was the absolute best and this special does not disappoint! Funniest I've ever seen! Do yourself a favor and pick it up
5,Patrice will be truly missed.,"Hilarious, funny, witty and likeable comedian. I love his facial expressions, his timing and his delivery. Cracks me up every time. He will truly be missed."
5,I have never laughed harder in my entire life.,"Patrice O'Neal will probably forever be the funniest man I will ever have the pleasure of hearing. Quick witted, off the cuff, brutal, honest, insightful, silly, brilliant social comedy hitting on everything from race, to politics, to relationships, to white babies on keychains and everything else in between. You heard correctly.. white babies on keychains. :) Beyond outstanding. He will be mised sorely.. and this is him at his absolute best."
5,Never stopped laughin! it is a must for Patrice fans,"Elephant in the room is Patrice's best work, lets you know who he really was as a comedian. If you like Patrice - you should get this dvd."
4,This is one funny dude!,I have seen him live and on TV and he was truly an underated talent. He is funny while still giving you a point of view on common subjects and really making you wonder why you never saw it that way...FUNNY!!!
4,Thoroughly recommended,"I'm preparing a paper on Physicians in the Complaint process in Canada. The author has a lot of experience in the U.S. system , much of which is relevant to us,especially the advice to doctors about coping with this trauma. The authors other papers are helpful and I wanted this book for reference"
2,"Adverse Events, Stress. and Lit","Pedantic, unsupportive, casual about a serious and inflamed issue.What about recourse?"
5,"A Fun, Entertaining and Insightful Look At The Creation Of A Masterpiece","This book is a must read for any fan of Apocalypse Now. It goes into detail about the creation of the movie and offers interesting insights into the pre-production process, including excepts from transcripts of conversation between Coppola and Brando about the Kurtz character. The rest of the book is filled with a ton of information. There is a great section on the different cuts of the film, including a look at the 5 hour rough cut. This book makes a great companion when viewing Apocalypse Now Redux."
4,It Fills In A LOT Of Blanks,"I found this on a shopping trip years ago and had hoped to find additional copies for friends and buddies. This is a must-read, not only for fans of the movie, but for those curious about the era and of the process of filmmaking in those years."
2,Inappropriately named - -,"A person coming from a Christian point of view, and interested in study of the ""last days"" can be very fooled by this title.I was, and so was partially handicapped relative. Intended to return it, but misplaced address.May read as connections could be of interest."
5,A TOP CLASS METAL ALBUM,"Right mates...this is a piece of absolute great Heavy Metal!!!It have been listening Heavy Metal since 1987 but I've discovered Running Wild only in the fall 2005!!! In Italy we use to say ""Better later than never..."". I do love the band's discography...but this album, along with ""Death Or Glory"" and ""Blazon Stone"", is on top of my personal Running Wild list for sure! Rock'n'Rolf is not just one-man-band, I wish many more artist like him would have crushed into the Metal scene through the years...Black Hand Inn, Soulless, The Privateer, The Phantom Of The Black Hand Hill just to name the top tunes...but the average quality level is defenetely at its top during the whole album! DO NOT MISS THIS PIECE OF METAL!!!"
1,Sounds Aweful,Yes this is The Untamed Youth with Deke Dickerson. This recording sounds Aweful buy the $3 used copy if you must have it.
3,Not the greatest but not the worst.,"This eye kit had horrible instructions. It was just telling you to line the upper and lower lashline of your eyes and that's it. The brush is horrible and doesn't work. It creates a really thick line that smudges. The liner shadow is very dark which was expected and it goes on very thick. The liner shadow is very intense and is like wearing liquid liner. So overall the instructions sucked, the brush sucked, and the liner shadow was good, not great."
2,don't get the point of this kind of liner,"i usually wear liquid liner for the ""retro"" look, i bought this coz of all the great reviews -- but i don't understand the point! the line you get is fuzzy and i ended up with black powder falling under my eyes so it looked like i had dark circles! I've gone back to my Revlon Colorstay Liquid Liner, looks great, lasts, and doesn't smudge (very much) -- plus it's cheap!"
5,Great!,Thisw is one of my favorites. It is a very good quality vhs and has subtitles. If you want the original episodes uncut and in orginal format ths is it!
3,"..Although I love Hotaru, I hate the dub to death..","..I hate the dub, and I really don't recommend anything with the dub.. Go out and buy the subtitle.. Even if this is uncut, it doesn't mean that it's the same exact thing as the subtitles. So, if you wanna see the real Sailor Moon videos.. Buy the subtitles. Sure, some of the words are changed because of the translations/subtitles but it's all good. They got the name of it somewhat right. I don't feel like looking it up right now but I know it means ""Pretty Soldiers Sailor Moon,"" Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon is what I think it is, dont't remember. Hotaru kicks. I say this only as a loyal Sailor Moon watcher.. Buy this."
5,"Since this movie has four episodes, I couldn't resist !","What I mean by that is that this is the only one in the uncut version for this season that four episodes instead of three. I would ALWAYS put five stars if the movie's episodes are good. But this one has four episodes and[ even if the first episode is kind of boring] I'm gonna give it five stars anyways. What can I say? This movie has three good things about it[ besides the fact that this is the movie that eveeryone has been waiting for, the last movie and the four last episodes in this season]:1. You get an extra episode out of the deal.2. This movie is 95 minutes long.3. [ In my opinon]I think the box looks pretty coolBye- bye!"
4,Basic and sturdy.,"I bought this toolbox because I was tired of using a cardboard box to hold our mess of tools. It's a nice toolbox, very sturdy even in the handle. I recommend it for the basic tool-user."
3,came with a dent in it :(,"This tool box arrived in perfect packaging, but when I opened the box, the tool box has a big dent in the top of it. I ordered it as a gift, and it is not suitable to be used as such, so I will probably never get to find out how well, or not, it holds up, but judging by the fact it came damaged, I'm thinking it can't be all that sturdy. Oh well, it is working as an object that takes up space, and cost wasted money."
3,good SMALL toolbox,"Wow is this toolbox small. I would have liked one about double the size. I guess it is my fault for not measuring the size of toolbox I would need. This toolbox is strong and durable, but I can not fit much in it at all. It is almost like a tool box for a specialist who only need to carry a small amount of certain tools. I maxed this toolbox's space out after I put in my 2 hammers, some screw drivers, and a few other small items. I could not even fit my crowbar in the tool box. I now use it as a container on the shelf.I would recommend this toolbox to someone who needed to transport a small amount of items. It is a nice tool box and looks very good, but does not hold even close to enough items for myself to really do some work."
4,solid little box,"The box is good. Its solid, and a little on the small side, but a good box over all. I wish the top tray was made out of metal (its plastic) but other than that, it works for its intended purpose. I put a few tools I don't use that much in here, so it doesn't get much use, therefore I can't say anything about the latch mechanism, which seems to be the weak point in all tool boxes. It does appear sturdy to me though."
3,Flimsy and cheap yet functional,"For the price, I wasn't expecting too much, and though this tool box is functional and gets the job done, it is constructed cheaply so that it is a bit flimsy feeling. The metal sides and bottom seem very thin. The latch on mine is very loose, which doesn't make me feel very confident in carrying the tool box bc I'm afraid the latch will snag and open right up! The handle is all metal and solid feeling though. The interior top tray is all plastic and flimsy feeling. All in all a functional box that I would buy again... just keep your expectations low."
4,"Totally awesome book, fascinating!",This is a great book for anyone interested in off things. I pick it up occasionally and am always fascinated.
4,If For No Other Reason - Because They Are Still Great,"In fact, some of these songs have become jazz standards, such as After You've Gone and Hidustan. This is a great time capsule, people, and if you like American song, it needs to be opened. There's plenty of some of the best of Jolson, a few WWI memories, a taste of the stage (including the signature title piece), and plenty of comedy. There is also lots of contrast in style within, in spite of the limited period of time in which these pieces were published. A study of that facet alone is worth the time of any music student interested in popular song evolution. And you can always write me for further information on nearly any of the pieces. Quit reading - just do it!Note that some of these songs are on my site, and all the listings for all Dover ragtime books are there as well, with links back to this page."
2,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing.","The author's scholarliness and combatitiveness are impressive. His basis thesis is well articulated and defended. His candour when hypothesizing on uncharted ground is refreshing.However, his frequent logic chopping and reversion to academese in his many subsidiary arguments mar the credibility of much of the book's minor theses."
1,Hilarious - nonstop laughs!,"Silly, silly man. Unfortunately, the hobby of revising history, and attempting to disprove the historicity of the Bible is again a popular pastime. Akenson joins the bandwagon with an attempt at scholasticism that will have the religious angered and shouting, the liberals cheering and hooting, and the sane shaking their heads in dismay."
5,Informative & Enjoyable,"Donald Harman Akenson's Surpassing Wonder is an erudite and well documented history of the development of both the Christian Bible and the Jewish scriptures, including the Tanakh, Mishnah and Talmud. Akenson brings critical historical scholarship to a subject that is frequently seen only through the eyes of faith. His style is refreshing and easy to read and his respect for the scriptures he deals with is palpable."
2,Looks good but painful,"These were a good buy and look awsome. But cannot wear during a regular work shift. I had to take them off at my desk. Sexy looking but painful. As long as you do not have to wear them for very long, you'll be fine."
1,Horrible! Don't Buy.,"I bought 2 of these things and am sorry I did. Both of them are sticky and low quality- the turbo and slow also work sporadically if ever. Not to mention both of the controls are broken and the only directions you can move in are forward and slightly to the side.Buy a different brand, ALL of my experiences with Mad Catz have been low quality junk."
4,When We Gonna Get the ORIGINAL?????????????????,"Journey to the Light is all well and good, but WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET THE ORIGINAL ""STORMIN'""? IT's gotta be out there somewhere. It is the BEST' the one and only!"
4,Upbeat and Funky,"This album is a hidden funk gem. Track three ( every time I see you, I go wild) is a seven minute trip to groove paradise. The strings, horns, bass, and voices boom all over the 9 tracks. The only let down is that the disc only runs for 40 minutes. If you are looking for some great funk and soul music from a potentially unlikely source this is it. Pure Gold."
3,OK book,"Average photos of each species. I would have liked a key, but no such luck. Not really a handbook, but a collection of photos of Australian trees. It would be one of several books on this subject."
1,do not buy...,"...unless you don't like happy endings. if you're looking at this product then you know what i mean by happy ending. the video is hot, but honesty, its just not worth it."
2,Good...But,This is a good case except for the fact that when you want to charge it or put music on it you have to undo the metal thing and unsnap the case which is bad because with the other ones you can just plug the stuff in with no problem.Thats why I dont like this case
5,Invaluable,"Blakey's scarcest and in many respects most exciting group, the last to feature David Schnitter's tenor sax and Walter Davis Jr.'s incredible compositions. Look for both Parts I and II of this Dutch recording. Otherwise, if you can't find the single volume editions, this may have to do. At least it has the aria-like Davis tune, ""Jody."" Soon after this recording, the Marsalises held court in the Messengers groups, and the Blakey fire and magic was no longer there.A couple of other Blakey essentials--""Backgammon"" and ""Gipsy Folk Tales""--have yet to be reissued on CD. Both are well worth hunting down in their original LP format (don't hold your breath for a digital version of either--if Van Gelder didn't record the session, it probably won't appear. Hence, the overkill with the Morgan-Shorter-Fuller groups and shameful scarcity of later Blakey editions with musicians like Schnitter, Bill Hardman, Mickey Tucker, Vladimir Ponomarev)."
2,Half the book is ok -- just ok.,"The half of the book set during WW-II isn't bad. Nothing amazing, but not bad. However, the contemporary part of the book, i.e. the The Obit man himself and his story is completely extraneous to the main plot. Apart from shoehorning in a reporter (the author's ego) into the plot, and giving him a variety of women to bed, it does nothing else. A story solely about the WW-II character, Mr. Foix, would have been far more interesting. Lastly, there are far too many typos in the book for it to have been reviewed professionally. IMHO, if you want a good WW-II story, try MacLean or Ludlum."
5,Wow!,"I have read many ""how to books"" that are advertisments for theirproducts or books bragging about their wonderful artwork but this book tells all! It is very easy to understand and tellsexactly how to get the results wanted. What a refreshing change!"
3,"Transforming Fabric: Thirty Creative Ways to Paint, Dye and Pattern Cloth","A good book if you are looking for technical information concerning ways to colour cloth. However, the book does not contain much in the way of finished examples, an element which I always appreciate in a do-it-yourself craftbook."
5,CLEAR and PRECISE,I think it is the clarity and precision with which the author presents her ideas. Very good resource material for my daughter. She uses it!
4,Transforming Fabric Updated,"Ideas, techniques and designs are updated in this newer version of Transforming Fabric. The book inspires one to create one of a kind designs."
3,Great Book/ awful smell,"Transforming Fabric: Thirty Creative Ways to Paint, Dye and Pattern ClothThe book is very informative, but I have not been able to spend much time with it due to the smell. I do not know where it was stored, but it smells like it was in the garage with puppies or kittens.The ideas & methods in the book are clearly presented & I am hoping that the smell will disipate to the point where I can use the book to it's full advantage."
3,"The Quality of This DVD Leave Much Room To Be Desired,But",This live DVD is the only release of Spandau Ballet up to now.
5,Savage Innocents DVD,"Great movie from 1959, Anthony Quinn did not disappoint!Recently had a chance to watch it, I disagree with the other reviewer.No problems whatsoever viewing it. The other version mentionedis a PAL for European DVD players only and triple the price!This one played fine on my DVD Player here in the US.This was Peter O'Tooles debut performance, an interesting look back to history.Hard to find this dvd anywhere!"
1,"GREAT MOVIE, POOR QUALITY DVD!","The image on this page is for the superior quality Masters of Cinema edition. Be warned that what is actually being sold on this page is a DIFFERENT version, a poor quality South Korean import!"
5,Keeps my drink cold all afternoon.,"I really like the insulated tumbler,I go to exercise classes and it is perfect. It keeps my ice and water just great, and the dripless straw seal is great.You do not need any special straw for this tumbler. I take it everywhere with me. It also saves money on bottled water. I put ice and water from my fridge and away I go! Every one should have one. They come in some awesome colors, so check 'em out."
1,"Maryland's conservation laws, licenses, and enforcement officers",I received the wrong book. I have ordered this book 3 or 4 times and either have received the wrong book or have been told it is out of stock.
1,Painfully bad...,"I just recieved this product as a gift, and was delighted by the smell. Then I put some on. Seconds later I was considerably less delighted by the burning welts appearing on my pulse points. Just to clarify, I have no known skin allergies, my skin is not sensitive, and I have never reacted this badly to having some fairly harsh chemicals splashed on me. Avoid at all costs."
2,can't be perfect all the time,"this almost seemed like both cds were just phoned in comparison to all the other 5-6 bargrooves i have.. most of the songs sound the same without any memorable hooks.. it also sounds like it lacks studio musicians (keyboards and bass players) that seem so prevalent in the other releases.. this release sounds like it was all made on an electric machine with voice overs.. it's still ok, but bargrooves has set the standard so high, it's hard to believe they even cared that much about this release.."
3,French pick up lines,"I was looking for a quick French conversation learning CD set so I could learn some key phrases before my trip to France to visit a friend. I was pretty pleased with the first 3 chapters of this French Learning CD as it discussed greetings, general information about pronunciation, and how to ask for directions. However, by chapter 4 it was apparent this was made for an audience going to France to pick up on French women/men. I learned how to ask a person if they wanted to get a drink with me at my place/hotel or theirs, and how to ask when someone would like to go out. In one of the example conversation the American man asks a French woman where a street is and follows up with, ""How are you?"" and ""Would you like to get something to eat?"". In the example she (accurately) sounds very surprised at the change in conversation direction and kindly declines his offer. I can only imagine what I'm going to learn in the next four chapters. :("
2,"it looks black, but is brown!!!!","Is a really disappoint to me. I bought this watch and the reason that makes me to take this choise was the color!!! i thought that it was black, even it looks like a mate black, but really is not black, is brown!!! and in some parts you could see the stainless steel in its real color. I think that it is a cheat for the costumer. Please show the product like it really is!!!"
4,A Top Notch Live Hip-Hop Set,"Fabriclive has a lot of terrible albums in their ever-expanding series. It's a very nice treat when a great one like this comes along. A no non-sense live performance by The Herbaliser chalked full of tracks with tight lyrics and spun with an artistic flare from beginning to end.As a reference point to compare, I thought Fabriclive.19 by The Freestylers was absolutely horrible. The Herbaliser's Fabriclive album makes The Freestylers' set sound like something from a local ghetto ""talent"" show.This album ties Adam Freeland's Fabriclive.16 with 4/5 stars."
2,Kindagoodkindabad,"The last portion of this book which has interviews with raw foodists is fairly interesting and inspirational. The beginning section with the silly and never-ending ""fairy tale"" is a waste of good paper."
3,Review,Bought for Christmas present. Not sure how it is going to fit or hold up. Cant review more until then.
5,Pure Narada,"After losing custody of ""I Cry, I Smile,"" it dawned on me that I'd lost my anthem. I e-mailed Narada pleading for the source of another copy -- I even would have bought a turntable if it turned out to be an LP. Sweetheart that he is, he answered; but unfortunately, there were no copies available, and no plans to re-release it on CD. I couldn't be more thrilled that someone, somewhere, had a change of heart! Hearing this collection again was like hearing it for the first time. Narada gathered other wonderfully gifted artists (Hiram Bullock, Norma Jean Bell, Ray Gomez, Herb Alpert), and put his whole, pure Soul into every track. My heart took flight. The songs I missed most(the title track and ""So Long"") were there, of course, but I was touched to hear all the others again 'for the first time.' Narada, if you read this review, ""THANK YOU!!"" I have my anthem back."
3,Robots,Its a good book but one thing to remember is that it does not deal with Autonomus robots. It just deals with R/C robots. but it is very well put togather and easy to follow
2,disappointing,Not much great information and it is hard to follow and does not tell you how to build a bot and does not have clear instructions.
5,Best Cd I've heard in years!,"Heard him on the NPR show, and I was seduced by the sound of his music. Hadn't heard anything quite so interesting in 25 years. I don't go for much contemporary music. Been stuck in the jazz, folk, rock era of the 60's and 70's when I was a teenager and music was music. But this guy is impressive. Mesmerizing voice, intricate music composition and profound lyrics. Don't like the first track too much--he almost lost me-- but after that, the world changed and the ground opened up. Can't wait for the next one."
1,NOT FEELING THIS...,"I remember reading a magazine article on this man about five years ago.At the time(1997),poetry was becoming mainstream so you just know MTV and the mainstream music media had to have their fingers in it.And in that many poets/spoken word artists had gotten signed to major record contracts.Carl Hancock Rux is one of them...This quietly released debut isn't much to shout about though.I don't know but Rux's voice isn't that ""settling"" to hear.And his compostions sound rather corny.Most obviously with ""No Black Male's Show"".This is a CD that even a thick-skinned music fan like myself would quickly return.It's just bad.I really want to recommend Saul Williams' debut.That's a spoken word album worth listening to.And check out for the amazing Cody Chestnutt,album called ""The Headphone Masterpieces"" coming real soon."
3,Good but hard to understand,Music is good but most of the songs are not in English which makes it hard to get into if you don't understand what they are saying.
5,Excellent Translation and Valuable for Reference,"It is worth to seek this reasonably priced translation of eighteen of the Upanishads out. There are several reasons for this: The translation is excellent, each Section is also rendered in Sanskrit Transliteration, and the 145 page long introduction is most helpful as are the short Bibliography and Index. The main drawback is that the Sanskirt Devanagari text should have been included along with the transliterated text. This would have made this volume ideal. It was probably omited for reasons of length as this volume is already 951 pages long. --- A word of advice: Do not rely on any single translation. Instead use several side by side. I recommend R.E. Hume: ""The Thirteen Prinicipal Upanishads"", and if you read German, even better, Paul Deussen: ""Sechzig Upanishad's des Veda"", in my opinion still the best translation of all time."
5,Saddle Club Rocks!!!,I am a HUGE Saddle Club fan! This album rocks! The cast members are awsome singers. Im convincing everyone to buy this cd because it will be the best one that you've ever listened to. The Saddle Club Rules!!!
2,Reminds me of Remo Williams,"If you likedRemo Williams - The Adventure Begins(1985) you may like this movie which is along the same lines - i.e. Man from the west is trained by Kung Fu master to be a force for good. However, if I were to compare, I seem to recall liking Remo Williams a lot more for the humour. Joel Grey in that movie was hilarious as he played out all the oriental stereotypes while at the same time injecting a unique fastidiousness.This movie's link to the original Jekyll and Hyde story is nothing more than the names of the character played by Adam Baldwin. Like Remo, it was also intended to be a pilot for a TV series, but it wasn't very promising in the execution.The plot was rather loose and the vengeance motivation is a powerful drive that needs a powerful resolution which I do not get from this movie.The martial arts by today's standard is rather basic.I give it two stars cos knowing what I know now, I'd rather watch Remo Williams."
5,Works Wonders,"This medicated soap is great. Had used it for piercings, but it is also a great hand soap, as well as something to use on cuts and scrapes."
2,Weird,"It's as if the author was handed a list by the Augusta members of all the things they wanted clarified or addressed regarding Clifford Roberts, and the author was charged with clarifying the supposed misconceptions regarding this odd character. If you are looking for any sign that Bobby Jones was involved in the creation of the club and Masters, forget it. It's as if Jones was just lending his name to the place, like players do today as architects, and Roberts was everything about the club, in every way, shape or form. At least the pictures of the course are interesting and perhaps make it worthwhile to buy, but barely. The text is just a case laid out for making Cliff Roberts a saint. Who cares about that?"
5,don't let this cd pass you by!!!,This is the best album that I have yet to hear. Falling in love with Jesus with Jonathan Butler- This is a Love song that I can hear constanly. It immediately sends me into worship. Every song is perfect
1,The Gospel According to Jazz,"I actually ordered the Gospel According to Jazz, Part, but received Part 1. I already had Part 1, which is excellent!"
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,"I love this cd. I bought it 2 weeks ago and I listen to it everyday. There really isn't a song on the cd I do not like. However, if I had to pick I would say #s 1, 2, 10 & 11 are my favorite. I highly recommend this cd. I believe you will enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you and God Bless."
4,Very enjoyable,"I read the mixed reviews on this movie many times before actually ordering it as I was undecided since the reviews were all over the place. I decided. I ordered. I watched. The end result - it's a very, very good movie. I think what makes it work is the couples relationship. It's very real. It's very genuine. It is quite refreshing to actually see a movie where 2 woman are already involved, where they start out being gay... with no typical ""I'm going back to being hetero"" ending! The drama of the family situation is intense, but there is quite a bit of comic relief played by the friend Carmen. The love scenes are simple and tender. The plot is heavy. The acting is not overly executed but you find yourself being drawn to the women, their story and shared love. I'm happy I stumbled across it. If you are not a true movie critic or critic in general, you will find yourself enjoying this movie for many reasons, many times over."
3,"Gloomy, but deliciously so...","Anyone who says ""best ever"" hasn't seen many movies, but, it's a really refreshing move off the beaten track in terms of subject, but not very skillfully filmed. The cover art is deceiving: it looks like a warm summer romp in St. Tropez, but it takes place around Christmas on the east coast. The characters are interesting, and very real and believable; so is the family situation which is the focus of the movie and the issues between the main characters. The women have great chemistry between them - I was convinced that they have known each other and/or have been together for years. I liked their lifestyle, THANK GOD for something NOT stereotypical. This is a brooding movie set in New England, so don't expect anything cheery, but it works pretty well. I really did like the focus, but the dialogue was a bit shakey at times. The Mother is deliciously cold and stubborn, and the ""buddy"" who visits is the perfect counter to the gloomy mood. Worth a watch."
3,Treading... and treading... and,"The movie is okay, but not great. The couple is believable, but the problem family is overdone. Mom is just a little too much and the whole situation is a little unreal. The lead characters aren't quite up to being leads. Almost, but not quite. Overall, it was slow but a good try."
3,It's just a movie folks!,"If you want the world problems solved in 90 minutes then rent another movie. This is a independent movie-aka low budget, little time to shot the thing and new actors. So...as for an indy film it's not all that bad...there were several story lines going but you had to work at finding them.The part of the film that bugs the heck out of me was the sound quality or lack there of. At certain times, I flat out couldn't hear what was being spoken. Bottom line...it's a rental not a buyer. Rent two movies that night just to be safe."
1,Glad I rented it first,"I would have to go along with those who said they were glad they did not buy this. Not exactly horrible, but an hour and a half or so of my life I will not get back. Scenery was nice, but I could not hear half the dialog, and what I did hear was nothing to write home about. Do yourself a favor; save your money for something better."
2,Rent first!!,"The movie had a few good kissing/cuddling scenes and it showed [body parts] which gave it a plus, but overall, I'd say the bad outweight the good. It was really sad and it had a just plain awefull ending. Rent it before you buy it! Chances are, you won't want to be stuck with it in your...collection."
2,The pouting....,"The general tone of this movie is morose. There is zero believable chemistry between the Alex and Casey. The acting is generally hideous - count the pouts! The subplot regarding Casey's brother is annoying and largely unnecessary. A lot of potential, but this movie doesn't pull it off."
2,drown me now,this was a plot-less film with zero experienced film makers and actresses...no style...just drown this film rent if you have to see it...remember curiosity killed the cat
4,My 1st Lesbian Movie,"To add to the mixed reviews about this movie, I'm glad this was my first lesbian movie that I've seen because it portrayed a strong connection between the two characters Casey and Alex that speaks to my personal desire. I think their strong intimacy really stood out to me and was tastefully portrayed in the ""sex"" scene. Listening to the commentary (a feature on the DVD) during this scene helps the viewer understand that the producer's intention was not to show a graphic sex scene but a scene of lovemaking between a couple that has been together for a while and shows a strong emotional and physical bond. The scene is a prelude to what happens next which we can all imagine on our own (although I wouldn't have objected seeing some more of that scene!) Nina is great as well as the water scenes of Massachusetts!"
3,For the audio commentary,I strongly recommend you to listen to the audio commentary of the movie : the director and the two leading stars are funny especially Nina Landey who is smart and has a great sense of humor. I really had a good laugh.
1,Time ill spent....,"Ladies, are we so devoid of decent lesbian flicks that we will just devour anything they throw our way? The only bright spot in this horrible mess is Nina Landey. The editing is horrible, the acting is truely sub-par: although given what they had to work with....This movie represents 2 hours of my life that I will never get back...EVER!"
3,Close to real life,This movie has many things going on not just about two women who love one another. Any family can be dysfunctional no matter where or how they live. Emotional issues never discussed can cause problems within a family. Casey come from money but chooses to live without the family wealth and support to do what she loves and be with who she loves. Her two brothers have their own problems as well but want to stay in their mother's good graces. Combine the events of the past with the present and throw in the Christmas holidays and it can end in so many different ways. The ending may be anti-dramatic but I think it worked. (Sorry if vague don't want to give away too much)
2,It sinks,"What begins with the suggestion of better things to come, ends as slow drivel to nowhere. Some of the one-on-one dialog scenes are so poorly directed that they grind to a crawl (I was often saying ""Cut!"" in my mind when sitting through these moments). The settings and scenery provide some production value, but the sound quality is poor. The relatively mild sexual encounters might encourage some to hang in until the end for possible fireworks -- but what there is, is not enough to merit a recommendation."
3,Not bad - good for one hour,"This is a story about life and its challenges. Different is not always accepted in this world, even by the ones you love. The main charater comes from a well to do family, but all she is interested in, is living ""her"" life, her way, being happy and true therself. For an hour or so, you will travel down her journey, with her. Not a bad move, but I did find it a bit long winded at places"
2,SO BORING!!!,"This movie starts off really slow. I mean yeah... the brunette lesbian is hot, but she alone cannot save this movie.15 minutes in, I thought I still have to give this movie a shot.45 minutes in, lesbian kissing scene. I was happy for about 3 minutes then they cut off the near-sex scene.65 minutes in, I'm wishing I'm drinking too.There's nothing special about this movie. It's as boring as an autobiography, except what makes autobiographies interesting is knowing that it actually happened to someone so you're forced to relate.This, however, was a boring movie. Waste of my time."
3,if you've been through it you'll see it in the film,"If you see it in the film then you will understand the silence and the relationships, if you have not been through it may come across as dull and uninteresting. Whatever you take from the film you still have to see it as a personal reflection on the pain some people feel in coming out and having their partner accepted, I enjoyed it, but I like Indy films, I enjoyed it because it made my disfunc family look normal."
3,Worth seeing.,"This film didn't really live up to my expectations. It's low budget and that's obvious. The quality of acting isn't quite up to par, but the characters are genuine. As far as the plot, it's a little too anticlimactic. You keep waiting for something significant to happen, and nothing does. What is supposed to be a major event isn't.Despite all my criticism, it IS worth viewing, maybe not buying. You do empathise with the characters, and the journey to that anit-climax is an interesting one. The mother is someone every out gay person has dealt with at one time or another, and it's both comforting and painful to see her and her daughter interact."
3,Poor acting got in the way of a good story,"The story really wasn't bad. In many ways, it could be the story of my family. I could very much relate to the intolerant mother but a father who just wants his daughter to be happy. The characters were real people... sometimes likeable, often annoying. I must say, however, that the VERY poor acting often got in the way of my and my partner's ability to thoroughly enjoy the movie. And yes, the ending was a downer, but it was real."
1,no no,do not do business with this company. i feel that they are not a good merchant. i am very dissatified with them. they only care about sales and not about doing what is right.
4,"Nice, but more sheer than I wanted","My order came today. The panels are very nice, but also very sheer which results in less privacy than I want. Consequently, I am ordering more to add to each door panel. I think I will be happy with three of these per door panel."
5,True to life story!,You can never go wrong with Karen Kingsbury! An awesome story with an awesome message. Would recommend for any age!
5,Karen Kingsbury never lets me down....,"Karen Kingsbury is a well-known Christian fiction and children's book author. Her Baxter family series were incredibly popular and it seems these books in the Women of Faith series will be just as wonderful. A Time to Dance takes the reader on an emotional journey of a husband and wife who are trying to reclaim their once vibrant and certain love for eachother.Karen Kingsbury is my all-time favorite author. Her books, although fictional, give insight into troubles that many of us face during our lives and provide scriptural truths on how to deal with them. This book was definitely an emotional roller coaster the entire way through. I went from laughing to crying and ended with a certain peace in my heart that if you listen to Him, He will lead you down the right path. Don't read this book unless you are prepared to stay up all night because you can't put the book down. You'll also need some tissues!"
5,"Attractive, well-designed, compact, quality stand","I've got two of these and they're fantastic. I bought a new guitar recently and I was very worried when I noticed that the nitro-cellulose finish was very delicate and that it often reacted with materials found on guitar stands. After a lot of reading and research I settled on the Genesis stand because the manufacturer was explicit about the padding materials used.The stand folds up into a very small package and it's one-piece so there are no parts to lose if you travel with it. I've used them for guitars and basses of all sizes with only some minor problems (see below). The stand is tilted back and the legs spread wide and it feels very, stable.There's a little strap that you can use to secure the part that holds the neck and some notches to store pickups.The only problem I've encountered is that the spread of the bottom 'arms' makes it awkward to use for some guitars that don't have symmetrical bodies. For example.. some basses, etc."
3,"camera, mp3, tv5","this camera, mp3 and tv5 is razzle dazzle in the ads however the tv5 is very tricky to function and you must resize the video on your computer before you watch it. there's no flash on the camera and every time you stop the mp3 it flips you to the front of the list to page through very slowly and very painfully all over again. get a nokia express musicphone...it's all the way around better and cheaper."
1,Never should have made it to the printer,This is a waste of ink. The language and editing are attrocious -- and I mean attrocious! This is nothing more than a collection of screen prints which do nothing to illustrate concepts. There is nothing here to help either a novice or an experienced programmer. The amazing grammar will have you putting the book down before you get through a few pages. Close your eyes and pick any other Delphi book.
1,Disappointed with Translation and Content,"This book suffers from being poorly translationed and for lack of usable content. It was obviously not well edited--notice under Trademarks that the paragraph end with an incomplete sentence ""as affecting the validity of"" . More seriously, things soon get worse in content, for the first chapter covers installation which should be a no-brainer with the installation screens which it reproduces. Chapter two, covers the Delphi 5 environment, but is even less useful than Delphi's online help. Delphi provides a tutorial that better explains the development environment. Chapter 11, ""Working with Database"" is slightly more focused, but come on guys, who is this book going to help?"
1,Essential Skills With Delphi 5,"Don't waste your money on this book, there is no real content and look like it was written by a novice trying to pose as an expert. The book should be name `getting started' but that would be an insult to Borland's Getting started manual that ships with Delphi. The biggest use of this book is to help start a fire in my fireplace."
1,Are you kidding?,"Who signed this chick? I hear the song on the radio and CRINGE! For the song 'Angel', the lyrics, vocal stylings, and song itself are all so cliché and juvenile. The whole, ""Hi I'm a hard core female gangsta, but I cry because I want my man back"" ... is SO old. It's 2003, not 1990. Unless you're a 12 year old, heartbroken teenager, the song ...!"
4,I Miss You,This is the only book I have found that is written in a sensitive and developmentally appropriate manner that addresses the need of the young child.Jo Ann Namm
3,I Miss You: A First Look At Death,"This is a very good informative book; but I feel the language may be a little difficult for very young children. I think, as it is read to children, one would have to be careful to explain concepts in terms a very young child could better understand. Talk on their level. Overall. A good book."
4,Good book but not for 4 year olds,"I purchased this book for my 4 year old daughter following the death of my mother. My mother was an everyday part of our lives and when she passed away suddenly, my daughter was unstandably confused. My daughter is too old to forget and too young to understand what was happening. On the advice of our pediatrician, I purchased a couple of children's picture books from amazon to try and help my daughter understand. This book is excellent at describing what happens when someone dies. However, my 4 year old just couldnt comprehend what it was trying to tell her. The very frank terms seemed to confuse her even more. I have decided to wait a year and try with this book again.Hope this helps."
2,Ok I guess,I was not impressed. Could have been better. Very short not worth the money. Would not buy again or recommend.
3,I MISS YOU,"Again, good book, but not based on our faith and to me that is a requirement when trying to come to grips or explain loss. Both books danced around that too much!"
5,good for younger children,This is a lovely book that addresses the loss of a loved one in simple terms. It also explains that young people can die of tragic and sudden events and does not merely focus on grandparents (as many others do). I highly recommend this book.
4,A very good reassurance for small children,"Our 4-generation family recently had a loss, and my kindergarten-age granddaughter was distraught to realise that when she had said ""good night"", she didn't know it was the last time and she would never have a chance to say ""good-bye"". The book's premise is similar, and it's a very gentle book to deal with loss. It's fairly non-religious, deals with guilt by making clear that mean thoughts can't cause someone to die, and makes it clear to children that being sad and lonely are normal feelings. We cuddled together and read and cried, and I think it helped her over the hump of grief into healing. I highly recommend this for preschoolers and early grades."
1,not what I needed,I bought this following the death of my 2 year old daughter's grandmother in hopes of helpng her but I felt this book was too above her to be of help so I returned it.
2,"a good book, but too sad for my 4-year old",I bought this book for my 4 year old daughter when my dad (her grandpa) died. I thought it might help her understand what was going on. But I felt like it was too sad for a 4-year old. Maybe age 6 or older.
1,not a Christian view,"After the loss of my 7 year old son, I looked for something to help my 5 year old daughter. I found this book to be lacking when comparing the death of a loved one as a drop of water that falls into the ocean. This was not comforting. The hope of the Christian faith is in our loved one being in Heaven with Jesus our Savior. This book does not claim to be a Christian book and is not. My daughter hung on every word about Heaven in the book ""Someday Heaven"" by Larry Libby which I highly recommend for a child dealing with loss or Lisa Tawn Bergren's ""God Gave Us Heaven"" for an even younger child."
4,Essential camping accessory,"This is a great tool for the avid camper. My boyfriend and I have a habit of eating late and in the dark. This stove light was a must. The amount of light emitted from the lamp is not significant (thus the 4 out of 5 stars), but it provides just enough light needed to cook safely and effectively without sacrificing use of your table lantern. The magnet is strong and fits perfectly on the top of my coleman stove."
2,"Not bright enough, short between battery and lightbulb","This seems like a great idea, especially for cooking after dark at camp. Unfortunetly, the light isn't that bright for night time use out of doors, and everytime I wanted to use it, I needed to pop the batteries out and back in again.I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Poor Lite for Road Trip Grils,If you are planning on using this with a Road Trip Grill one word. DON'T! It will not work with the Road Trip grills so save your money and get something else.
2,A Dark Dissapointment,"I have been a loyal Lustabder fan for the past 5 years and have read 10 of his titles. I have loved reading his incredibly descriptive style as he paints a pictue of political intrigue, family and spiritual ties and intense eroticism. But this book was not nearly up to par with his past works. The entire plot was overly confusing and too full of coincidences. If the Bonita twins were so powerful, why do they even need Lew Croaker, detective extraordinaire, to do a hit job for them? Especially since they ended up carrying it out themselves after all? Lustabder always has multiple charcacters, but in this title, they were all a jumble. The twins in their little white death truck seemed silly, and the severed heads and incestual sado-masochism was at some points was a little sickening. I was anxiously awaiting for this novel after Lustbader's hiatus, but this was definitely not worth the wait."
3,Ninja it's Not,"If you loved Ninja then prepare to be disappointed. None of the fascinating detail that made Ninja such a page turner. Minor moments when describing the world of Heta I, a South American healing art that stores power in stones. Lew Croaker's biomechanical hand has more of a personality then Lew, and is much more fascinating.Twisted plot involving South American magic, South Florida sleaziness, black market human organs, and secret government agenices.Although I read this book to the end, I can't say I recommend it."
4,"Good action book with multiple, complex plots.",Well written and suspensefull. You never quite figure out the characters until the end.
5,"DARK HOMECOMING, TRULY SPELL BINDING","A brilliant read, as Lew Croaker sets out to deal with his own inner turmoil of a broken realationship with his Sister, and the idea of killing a man in cold blood, for a chance of life for his 15 year old Niece whom he has only just met! He has killed before but only in self defence, so can he overcome the churning of a Police officer's instincts. The books plot takes turns sharper than a Swiss piste. The Character of Lew is very well written, and has appeared previously in the Nicholas Linnear novels by Lustbader. This book gives us a more intimate view of his character. We are also shown a very vibrant and intense side of Miami that some of us may not know exists. There are several nail biting moments, where we don't know if the hero will strike clean ground. If you enjoyed the Linnear novels, and also enjoy a slight twist of Native magic thrown in then this is a good read."
3,Small Hearts- Pretty Weird,"I just saw this one today, and it involved the rapid downfall of all the remaining Witches 5. I won't tell you what happens exactly, but each is punished according to their person personal interests, as was the custom for past Witches. Eugeal was big into transporting her daimons in cars and her car was tampered with, whereas Mimete wanted to be on the big screen, and she got unplugged, etc. Meanwhile, Hotaru starts to overlap with her Mistress 9 identity; for example, while she is on the Sovereign's throne she mentions ""Rini"" before carrying on again about heart crystals. She even starts talking nonsense (aloud this time) while in Rini's company. I saw the Edited version, but I read an episode summary, and this apparently didn't leave much out."
5,Sign of contradiction,"Few topics raise such passionate emotions among Catholics as the supposed apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Medjugorje over the past 25 years. Finally, in this masterly book, Donal Foley has made an in-depth, calm and dispassionate examination of the facts. He declares that the only rational conclusion is that the Medjugorje phenomenon has turned out to be (at least) ""a vast, if capitvating, religious illusion"". He reaches this conclusion only after a tightly-argued probing of the whole environment in which Medjugorje managed to become a worldwide propaganda machine. After reading his book, any reasonable Christian and loyal Catholic would have to agree. Nevertheless, the book may well create a furore of contradiction. But it should be required reading for anyone who had heard anything about Medjugorje."
3,"Informative, but could be better","If you already purchased the 1st edition of ""Do it Yourself"" you will notice the high quality formating, alternate angles and how each lesson repeats so you can practice along with the DVD... Not here. Yes there is good information, but it could have been presented better. The menu has 2 simple options, but when you go through each short scratch example it automatically advances to the next. Personally I would prefer an option to repeat until I chose to advance (similar to the Do it yourself series) so I could practice each lesson along with the DVD. Once again, good information, nice examples - but a pain to practice with."
2,Pura decepción,"""Lee Matilde Asensi"", ese era el consejo. ""Se equipara a los mejores novelistas históricos anglosajones, y es española y escribe en español!"" Y allí fui yo y compré una de sus novelas más exitosas, ""El Último Catón"" y comencé a leer y sí, estaba muy bien y es española y escribe en español!. Pero no todo podía ser así de lineal y efectivo. La novela comienza bien, con una buena trama y unos personajes creíbles y muy interesantes. A medida que pasan los capítulos todo comienza a ser inverosímil y los personajes comienzan a desdibujarse y hacen metamórfosis. De ser una novela histórica interesante, se transforma en una novela par adolescentes, tipo Indiana Jones! Al final ya se hace insostenible y culmina la novela de forma pueril e increíble. Lo que empecé con grandes expectativas, culminé pidiendo que terminara. Pura decepción."
2,get what you pay for,The plastic and leather cover broke as I put the phone in it. The whole set looks extremely cheap.
5,Noticeable results!,"Bought this to replace stock air filter and so far so good! Worth the 30 bucks. The first day I dropped this thing in my car I felt a bit more power than before. I drive an '01 Kia Rio and I need all the power I can get! Highway driving has improved too, smooth and better throttle response. :) all in all, a great purchase; highly recommend."
4,Good Quality - Not exactly what expected,"this is a nice quality piece - however, you should beware that the bead colors are not exactly what is shown in the photo -- photo shows primary colors with reds and oranges - actual colors are more pastel with pinks, yellows and light blues and greens. Perhaps, it depends on what is in stock -- but I expect to get what I see in a photo when I order unless otherwise stated."
5,Delightfully Entertaining,A very well written and colorfully illustrated book for small children 2-5 years of age. Our grand kids love the book and want us to read it over and over again!
3,Hunchback of Notre Dame,I was a little disappointed on how the book looked. The outside cover was wrinkled. It didn't claim that in it's description.
1,Terrible service!,"Although it was necessary to select a star in the rating line to satisfy the website, it should also allow Negative star ratings. The order for the item was placed on 12/04/2008; today is 01/08/2009, and I still have not received the item!!!"
4,david beckham soccer,If u love soccer this is the game for u. unlike other soccer games [edited] that u wanna get better at free kick but can't because the game has no practice which he created himself and now u can save your replays to your xbox console{only} and u could learn better soccer skills while your playing
4,Nice mat,"I bought this for my husband's birthday last year, he loves the Cubs...so he loved the mat. I have no complaints about it other than the colors are starting to fade a bit. But I guess that is to be expected after a year of use and the fact that it gets blasted with the sun in the afternoon."
4,Have to be a fan,This movie was really well done. If you like violence this would be a good movie for you. It is an accurate portrayal of the Punisher and gives that feel while watching. Definitely not a kids movie...
3,Marvel Max,Fairly true to the Max version comic. Not for the faint of heart. Blood and guts. More true to form than previous Thomas Jane version.
3,Punisher Warzone,"The movie was pretty good,the effects were good. It's worth the $2.99. More like the comic than the first one."
5,It keeps up with Marvel.,"This is the Punisher that I knew from growing up reading Marvel comics! Ray Stevenson played a great Punisher. This movie was a lot better than the other 2 previous Punisher movies. The Punisher arch enemy, Jigsaw, was kind of cartoony and lame in this movie. What makes up in the movie is Punisher's battle with the mob and the street gangs. I gave it a 5 by comparing this movie from the other 2 movie flop. I also gave it a 5 because the Punisher character persona coincide with the storyline from Marvel comics. Its about time Hollywood got it right."
3,way to much drama,"After watching this one, it makes the other two punisher movies really great. Between the flash backs and bad writing of this movie, I wished I had saved my money."
1,Punisher,"Why is everyone so down on the Thomas Jane version? Is is because it has a coherent script and some very good acting? I have seen about 10 minutes of ""WAR ZONE"" and will probably watch the rest at some point, but so far it has failed to involve me emotionally. I know this is supposed to be a ""reboot"" and not a sequel, but it seems very lacking in something."
3,Action Gore Movie ........,"it is the first time i saw an action movie that contains so much gore scenes , when i bought this movie i thought it will be the same as the first sequal but it was not this punisher is not like the first punisher not at all , but to say the truth the movie is nice contains allote of cool scenes it have a traditional action story , the bad guys are so silly not as the first sequal "" John Travolta "" , the movie deppends on visual effects even the shots and blood which make some scenes silly.in the end the movie is cool and entertaning."
3,"Cheeze and cursing, but not so bad","This movie was not as bad as some reviews suggest... when compared to the comic. Oh there's cheeze, but that's whats in the comic. Unrealistic gunshots, tough guy one liners, it all fits together. With that in mind I have to wonder why the ""f"" bombs? It appears as though someone was trying to make this movie into something it's not, a realistic look at a vigilante. Drop the ""f"" word and you have a good adaptation of the comic. The look of the film was perfect for the material, sound not bad, casting could not be better for the role of Punisher. I hope the studio tries again and decides what audience the film is targeting."
2,great movie,"This movie was a little better than the first one, but it's still not that great. The Punisher movies need to be more like the Jason Statham movies, nothing but action and violence."
3,"I preferred the 04 version, but an alright movie.","This movie is a good action movie, and starts right out with a shoot-out, and has a lot more gore and grit than the 2004 version, but the characters just don't feel as developed. It is a hybrid version of the Dolph Lungrin version and the 2004 version. This has much more back to the comic book feeling with the style of the shots/angles of the shots, and the lessened dialogue. My major gripe is we have yet a third way that the punisher's family dies. Dolph Lungrin movie-car bomb, 2004 movie family banquet shootout, This movie-killing in the park. This movie feels a bit like Highlander 2, good movie on it's own, but not in the vein of the last one to make a consistent storyline. Worth a viewing for fans, but not my favorite."
3,Best Punisher movie yet,"After viewing Punisher: War Zone I was surprised by this movie. Ray Stevenson is the best punisher yet and hopefully if another movie is made he gets the role. People have to know ""The Punisher"" is no Spider-Man or Superman, he is a vigilante that will stop at nothing to kill all the scum off the streets.My only negative about this movie was how Jigsaw was played. I would have had him play it serious and not over the top. Like the previous Punisher movie with the villian played by John Travolta, I never believed he could do any damage to The Punisher. Same with Jigsaw here.I am hoping for another Punisher movie and I am hoping a little more dialoge. This movie was fine, but the story just needed a little more backbone to it.Great buy for fans of violent movies and good popcorn rental. Parents be aware of the graphic violence."
2,Wouldn't Recommend for Adults,"I guess I could've liked this movie when I was 14-16. Would've liked James wacky ways or the Jigsaw Puzzles cut up face. It would have been cool to say to my friends that I liked all the gory action that took place etc. But at 17 I doubt I could even pretend to like this movie. Acting was terrible but I doubt any actor could've done better with the script they were handed.People give out ""5"" star ratings for a freaking commercial around here.Rating: 2.3"
3,An improvement over the previous films,"This movie by far, is the best Punisher movie. This deserves a sequel. Ray Stevenson IS The Punisher! This is the way a Punisher movie should be like. 100% faithful to the source material."
4,Great adaptation of Castle,"The Punisher charcter has never been a very deep character, but he has always been one of my favorite marvel characters along side Blade. This movie was right on target,the Punisher was not a hero,he was a revenge driven vigilante who wanted to Punish evil,and he used excessive force to do so, and i think this move showed that. I thought it was action packed and gory like the Punisher should be, real Punisher fans will like this because its morel ike the comic books,people who dont like it are looking for a different type of movie and thats why they dont enjoy it."
1,PunisheD,"There are very few films that I can't make it thru from beginning to end, but this is one of them. Too bad, because the lead actor and the ambience are decent -- it's just everything else that is dreadful. You'd have more fun watching a friend play an FPS game on his pc than sitting thru this dreck. And that's all this film is -- people getting shot. Wow, how original. You can crucify me for not growing up on Punisher comics -- but I didn't read Watchmen either before seeing the film, and Watchmen blew me away (5 stars)."
2,waste of time,i had high hope when i bought this moive but it turned out to be a bust. lost of action and killing but no story line. they changed how his family was killed from the first one which was lame. i wish i would have had a review like this before i bought it.
1,Skip It,"Need proof that some of the reveiws here are made by people getting paid to do so? Some people actually gave this movie 5 stars!!! What a joke. This movie is almost if not worst than Catwoman (I'm not kidding). The acting is horrible. Don't they screen the movies before they release them in theaters? I agree that the previous Punisher movie wasn't as good either but It sure as hell A LOT better than this one. Hell, I'll even watch the Dolph Lundren version than this crap."
3,First one is better,The new guy is and idiot I don't know why they try and make movies when the don't have to original actor in them. Still an ok movie.
1,NOT the Definitive Punisher movie!,"This movie was completely lame. The acting was terrible and the plot was even worse. Yeah, it was violent, but you can go see violent movies without them being crappy. The only difference between this movie and Shoot 'Em Up is that this movie didn't seem like it was supposed to be a comedy. Since when was the punisher a gag comedy? This was like watching a violent three stooges. Anybody who liked this movie is completley freaking retarded. Oh really? You liked it? YOURE A MORON! This movie ruined the Punisher. The previous Punisher movie was awesome, and had great actors. I know a lot of whiny fanboy idiots complained that it wasn't gory enough for the Punsiher so Marvel apparently decided to make a retarded movie to appease all of it's drooling idiot fans. You're all morons. You all suck. Goodnight."
4,NOW THIS IS THE PUNISHER!,"After a couple of failed attempts at making a great Punisher film, Punisher War Zone gives us what fans were looking for. It's in your face and gritty and our ruthless hero takes no prisoners. The film has a sense of comic style with a fair amount of gore, but it keeps the core of the comic book character at heart. The film is fast paced and leaves little room for long explanation, but who cares? This guy is bad to the bone! Don't bother buying the two disc edition as the second disc is only a digital copy. This is a practice that has got to stop!"
4,the best punisher movie yet,"this is for me,hands down,the best Punisher movie hands down.i liked the story and there's plenty of action.also,there's no lame dialogue in this version.in fact the dialogue is kept to a minimum.but that works here.Ray Stevenson makes for A good Punisher.he seems very natural in the role. and delivers the lines he does have well.a word of warning though,this incarnation of the Punisher franchise is ultra violent and very graphic compared to the two previous Punisher movies.i was actually very surprised to find that this movie made almost no money at the box office.i guess maybe it was due to the fact that there weren't a gajillion explosions.anyway,for me Punisher:War Zone is a 4/5"
3,"Entertaining, but a Little Goofy- Thomas Jane is Still the Best","This is one of those movies where the setting and characters are American- and it's obvious that the cast is European and they are running around Montreal, Canada.Stock footage of New York City and phony street signs are occasionally thrown in as if to say ""Hey, we're just reminding you that this is SUPPOSED TO be New York.""Goofy.Having said that, the violence is more on par with the comic book than any of the previous films, and in many respects is also more true to the source material than the other films.I still prefer the Thomas Jane Punisher and its gritty realism.This version of Frank Castle fires thousands of rounds of ammo every time he pulls out his gun.The buildup of music, followed by the single crack of Thomas Jane's pistol firing one single round into John Travolta, and then silence was just gripping.Sometimes less is more."
2,Punisher: War Zone,"This movie is made for action lovers with weak minds. It is not even close to being as good as the first Punisher. The story line is weak, boring and then they throw in enough curse words to make a sailor blush. When will movie makers learn that ideas can be expressed in english without having to throw in cursing. I was very disappointed after seeing the first Punisher."
1,Worst film ever made in the last 30 years,"I'm a huge comic book enthusiast. I enjoy even the BAD comic book films, but this movie is one that even I couldn't enjoy. I began watching it with some friends, knowing it was going to be bad, and for the first 30 to 40 minutes, I laughed hysterically at it's poor quality and bad acting. But eventually I stopped laughing because even the poor writing and overuse of the multiple red and blue light filters the cameramen were using was no longer fun to make fun of anymore. Not only that, it was BORING! I was very embarrassed for the film makers because this just might be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I own all the comic book films based on DC and Marvel comics characters, even the really bad ones...I will refrain from purchasing this DVD."
5,Action with a story,I am not a Marvel Comics fan nor did I see the first two Punisher movies but I thought this movie really rocked with all of the dark action as well as letting one be aware of the back story for Frank Castle without bogging the action down. I thought Ray Stevenson struck the right balance between the seemingly cold and unyielding exterior the Punisher projects with the lonely man who still has a human heart and wishes his family were still alive. There are enough bad guys and side kicks to keep things interesting without needing a line up sheet to remember who's who. The behind the scenes extras lets the viewer know about all the hard work the actors and others put in to the movie to keep it true to the Max series of The Punisher graphic novels.
5,Great comic/action movie,"I loved this movie, great action and gun play. definitely A great comic movie, fans of the punisher or john woo like shoot outs will love this movie."
4,Awesome,This Punisher movie is by far the best incarnation of the comic book. This is the Frank Castle I remember from the comic books.
5,Action Packed movie!,I Saw this Movie in Theaters and I Pre-Ordered this on DVD because there's a lot of action in this movie and I can't wait for 12 Rounds to come out on DVD.
2,Grotesque Third Punisher Film Not For The Squeamish,"""Punisher: War Zone"" is the third attempt by Marvel to start a franchise based on the ultraviolent vigilante who wreaks havoc on the underworld after the death of wife and children. Ray Stephenson takes up the mantle from Dolph Lundgren and Thomas Jane. The first two were their own kind of misfire, but this film is the worst of the three. Grotesquely gory, this film goes way past point of cartoonish action and descends into scenes that some horror movies would shy away from - heads blown completely off, faces blown off, and mutilations and gorings aplenty.The cast and the general direction could have led this film into promising territory, but the desire to gross out the audiences overrode good taste and turned what would have been at worst a passably entertaining film into a sideshow remembered only for continuing Marvel's inability to start this franchise."
1,Punishing to watch.,The idiot before me should be punished for this review.This movie was a waste of Frank Castle and a script.Marvel will never get this movie right because they simply don't understand the character.
3,a little disappointed,"I am a big comic book fan and i love the punisher. This movie fell a little short to me in a couple areas. The main area was the special effects of the movie. The movie is very gory like the punisher would be in the comics, but the special effects looked similar to a 90's horror film. A lot of really fake looking blood and fake looking body parts getting blown off. In this day and age with technology the death scenes should have been much better and not so cheesy. The story was just ok to me. There wasn't anything in regards to the story that would make me want to watch this movie over and over again. This version of the punisher is slightly better than the last two versions, but that isn't saying much. The movie isn't a complete waste of time if you go into watching it knowing it isn't going to be a great movie."
5,Best game i ever played,"this game rocks!!! i had a garage sale and i had enough money to get this and it was worth it!this game not only has great graphics,and has a good storyline, but has disney characters AND final fantasy caracters!(also new caracters(sora,riku kairi)the music is also very good, it fits in with the place around you.the magics are VERY cool too.the keyblayeds that come from each world and from people,help ALOT with battleing heartless or bosses and are cool looking.this isnt a difficult game,but its not easy ethier.i recommend this not only to children,teens ,but to adults too(my friends dad plays it and i gave him my guide to borrow because im in the last world, but two months later i watied for him to give me the guide and my friend said to wait until he's done and then she will give me the guide and hes still in wonderland!).Overall ,this a very good game."
4,Awesome!,This game is totally great! It isn't lackluster like most of the other Disney games. The characters are beautifully rendered. The storyline is great. The bosses are challenging. I love seeing all of the Disney characters and all of the different worlds. This is a must for any Disney fan. Warning: this game is addictive!
1,I AM OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME WAS FUN AT FIRST, BUT NOW 2005 I CANNOT STAND IT NOW!!!!!! I RECCOMEND KINGDOM HEARTS: FINAL MIX BECAUSE ITS GOT A BRITNEY IDOL CHARACTER IN INNIT. THAT WOULD BE THE LOVELY NAINME SPEARS WHO MALES WILL GO CRAZY FOR, BUT THRE SAD THINGIS SHE IS TAKEN. THE ORIGINAL KINGDOM HEARTS FEELS EMPTY AND I AVA PLAYED IT SO MUCH AND NEVER COMPLETED IT. THIS IS COS I WANNA PLAY KINGDOM HEARTS 2 INNIT. BUT I WILL PROBOLY ONLY RECCOMENED THE KINGDOM HEARTS 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN COS IT'LL HAVE NAINME INNIT. THE CAMERA SUCKS THOUGH AND ITS SO 2002!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PLUS DO US A FAVOUR AND GET RID OF RIKU COS HE WANTS NAINME!!!"
1,The worst game in the world,"This game is so bad I would give it -100 stars if I could. I personally loath this game. The graphics are horrible, The story stinks, and I would not take this game if you paid me!"
1,an assualt on everything square has strived for,"when i first heard of this game i thought it was a joke.but square actully went through with it! this has got to be THE worst idea in the video game world.its hard to take a game seriously when goofy is in it. can you imagine, goofy fighting against cloud?! i cant beleave anyone would even consider this game! dont waste your money. if you want a good rpg go with squares other accomplishments and steer clear of disney. [Money] tword disneys next movie is what this is. if you have any sense at all you will pas this game up and not look back"

1,an assualt on everything square has strived for,"when i first heard of this game i thought it was a joke.but square actully went through with it! this has got to be THE worst idea in the video game world.its hard to take a game seriously when goofy is in it. can you imagine, goofy fighting against cloud?! i cant beleave anyone would even consider this game! dont waste your money. if you want a good rpg go with squares other accomplishments and steer clear of disney. $[money]tword disneys next movie is what this is. if you have any sense at all you will pas this game up and not look back"
5,good god this game is AWSOME,"kingdom hearts, the name alone will scream at you BUY ME IM GOOD...!!! but the name isnt the only good part, this game ROCKS! the graphics are awsome, the misic is pure disney, and the fighting is one of a kind(way better than the ffx turn based [stuff])..."
4,FUN BUT CAN BE CONFUSING,This is a good game I got it in November 2002 and I'm still playing it. I like the game but in some parts of the game I just didn't know what to do. So I recommend you get a guide for it. It tells how to beat bosses (except sometimes they're wrong). What I'm trying to say is get a guide and you'll think this game is a lot easier.
5,Amazing!,"I rented this just because there were no better games. I am so glad there weren't!!! This game is truly brilliant! It is a must have for fans of Disney or Final Fantasy! I loved the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas and was so happy to see characters from it. I would recommend this to anyone of any age. What diversifies this from other games is the weapon, also. The hero weilds a magic key hunted by a dark race. The best way to describe this game is a very dark Disney film"
3,Keeps going and going,"I rented this game..and it was ok..I expected more disney character interaction but you have other characters like from final fantasy which my older boys liked..you fight the same things basically over and over and win easily..you have to back track alot(which my 11 yr old found ""complicated"" and it is definatly not for young players. You have to use diffrent controlls like jump using O instead of X which is weird. but to transfer worlds has a neat concept and my kids found it entertaining..but its like any role play game you play it till your done which we almost did in 3 days and then you dont play it again."
3,LOADS of potential; but TAKE OUT THE DISNEY THEME!!,"Kingdom Hearts has a great deal of potential for being a fantastic, exciting game, but the whole THEME with all that Disney stuff totally ruins it. Like the main character is really really cool, but when you see him running aroung with Donald and Goofy it kind of takes away some of the mystery or coolness about him. I mean, really, If you took Sora and Kairi and Riku and all their fighting paraphernalia out of this cute little disney-universe (where you meet jiminy cricket, the cheshire cat, and the queen of hearts) and put them in something a bit more jak & daxter-ish/sci-fi-y, the game would be great. But then, of course, you would destroy the whole backround theme. But come ON! The blockbuster vid game case's summary of it begins:A RACE OF EVIL BEINGS KNOWN AS THE HEARTLESS HAVE ABDUCTED SORA'S BEST FRIENDS, RIKU AND KAIRI FROM THE DESTINY ISLANDS AND KING MICKEY FROM DISNEY CASTLE.That last part sounds like a kidnapping from Disneyland."
5,I LOVE THIS GAME,"with the combination of squaresoft and disney mixed together it makes the most addicting and most fun game ever. there is no flaw in this game that i can see and there is a well diversity of the characters in it. needless to say, i was addicted to this game from beginning to end. i would recommend this game to any player, any age."
4,The puzzles are too hard,"Kingdom Hearts is an OK game but the puzzles are a bit hard for me. And also, it is hard to get around everywhere. It took me a few days to even complete Wonderland...and I even had a guide book but it didn't help me get around. I am not saying it is a bad game, it is just that it is hard to get around and solve puzzles."
4,"Wonderful, but with a slight problem.","My daughter absolutely loves all the Kingdom hearts games; she pretty much loves anything Kingdom hearts! One thing she told me one day was that, the game was very hard even on the easiest level you can get on! She said sometimes she would spend an hour trying to fight something because even if she is a higher level than it was too hard for her. I must say out of all the great stories (and the million times she has showed me her strategy guide) It must be a great story with a great story line, but she told me that she is glad they made a number two easier because number one is to hard (even though she beat number two once and almost about to beat it a second time)"
1,It Is Horrible!!,I hate this game. I played it at my friends house. It was one piece of crap. It was realy cheasey. They changed Squall's name to Leon because of meeting the King Mickey. That is just plain old sad.-jonnittiPS-Sorry to put you guys down on square-evolution.
1,Too dark to see,"The game starts out great. Excellent graphics. Even has its funny moments. Then came the night of the storm, and suddenly you have to navigate through the entire island in almost complete darkness. I've never been able to get past this part because I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING other than a hint of bluish light and a gate in the distance which you aren't supposed to go to until you find Rikku. 90% of the time I find myself guessing where I'm going because I have absolutely no idea. A mini-map of some sort like they have in Final Fantasy games would've been nice. But no, the game designers decided that would've been too easy.I don't know what the game designers were thinking when they made this game, but forcing players to navigate in complete darkness isn't my idea of fun. I tried adjusting the brightness of my TV to maximum, even turned off all the lights in my room, but I still can't see a thing.If it weren't for the near-total darkness, I might've given this game higher rating."
5,Korihako,"Kingdom Hearts is the best game ever!I recommend it if you like fighting games.It has great graphics,voiceovers,characters,combats,and storyline.Anyways,the main character of this game isa 14 year old boy named Sora.The game starts in his dream and when Sora beat the shadow heartless you endup waking up in destiny's island.Sora,Kairi,and Riku decides to leave the island to see other worlds.Sora collects the items needed for the boat,and that night Sora obtains the keyblade to save Kairi and Riku.Sora endsup in Traverse Town and joins forces with Donald and Goofy to find their friends and open the door.This game is great and all but,I thought the disney characters made the gameretarded.My sister thought this game was stupid because she couldn't beat it,she thought it was hard but,I thought it was easy."
5,KH review,"This is the Ideal game of all ages. The characters will delight the younger genorations, while the gameplay is good for the teens of all ages. Overall, having beaton the game myself, I'd say its one of my faves."
2,"Not for ""Everyone""","Unusually violent for a ""E"" rated game (who comes up with these ratings???). The main character Sora frequently must repeatedly pummel the evil Heartless characters with a key or sheild to advance through various stages. He is joined later in the game, and much to my dismay, by popular Disney characters, like Goofy and Donald Duck, participating in the beatings. I never thought I'd live to see the day when Goofy would be trying to beat the poop out of something. The violence comes to a climax at one point where Sora commits ritualistic suicide by ramming a key into his heart to save his little girlfriend.I think the next time Disney partners with someone to make a video game, they should at least attempt to keep it on this side of carnage. A major disappointment!!!"
3,Visually stunning with poor gameplay.,"I love RPG's and I love Disney. What could be better. Well, i bought this when it 1st came out and played it for several days when I got to a point in the game where I was supposed to do ______ ?I have no idea and that's the problem. I had been to every available world back and forth and looked in every room, cave, nook whatever. I couldn't find anything else to do. so, i would quit and come back later with a fresh view. nothing. I couldn't find anything else to do and the story wouldn't progress. There was no help at all from the game and eventually i got bored with it and used the gameshark to pass it and move on. But, i had no interest in the game after that and never finished it. Shame."
3,Not an RPG,"I bought this game for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves RPGs like Dragon Warrior and FF10, so I thought he would like this game from the user reviews I read.But buyer beware! This game is not a traditional RPG. It's not turn-based, and that makes it more like Nintendo's Zelda games than a RPG.The graphics are nice, but the story is weak, and the game is really difficult.You'll find yourself doing the same things over and over and over again just because you fell from a high spot. Your also going to have to use a walkthrough to find what to do next.The worst thing about this game though is the camera angle problems. You'll find yourself constantly adjusting the camera so you can see yourself and see around you. It's really annoying.I would not recommend this game, even though it is a great price."
2,BAD GAME KIDS!,"This game is horrible, Sora is prehaps the cheekyest character in vidio game history, and Goofy and donald are very, very annoying. Also the cutscenes are way too long and are unskippable, and the story sounds like it was made up by a two year old. Now, to the game play; the ""heartless"" (the enemies in the game) are fun to fight in the begining of the game, but the battles get boring and repetative later on, and the later bosses may be too hard for your a younger gamer. goofy & donald's AI is incredibly stupid and are better used as sheilds rather than fighting partners. Also magic is too easily used up. Overall I only gave this game one star if it hadent been for the Final Fantasy cameos."
4,This is by far the best game u can buy for PS2!!!,"It takes a long time to beat this game' but it's worth it! The graphics are excilent, and so is the story. The whole game is alot like a long movie. Most people beleave it would be a dumb game because it has Disney characters in it but they actully make the game harder and funner! I recomend this game for people looking for a chalenge, or if your looking for something fun to do in your spare time. It's a really fun game I played it constently every day, and it still took me a year to beat it, but this game is my favorite anyway! It even has kind of a love thingy between 2 of the big characters (Sora and Kaire). Well I hope my review encourages you to buy this game' It's really great!!!"
4,Kingdom hearts rocks,Ok Kids. I got this game yesterday when it came out. And it freaking rocks. Ive never seen anything like this game. get it now.
5,Madddd goodddddd,I dont like a lot of playstation games bcuz ima girl butt this game is mad good lol. i love this game so much but once you get to higher levels it gets harder..
4,ITS AWSOME!,"The first time I played Kingdom Hearts, was wene I rented it. The begining can be like [garbage]. But wance you leave the island it gets more difficult. You basically have to find the key hole in every planet you go to. Im not sure how many plants there are, but there all fun. Like Altlantica, Alice in wonder land, halloween town, monstro, agrhaba, the deep jungle (tarzan level, but it disappoints), traverse town, Cloesium gates, and Hallow Bastion. One of my favoritist level is Hallow bastion, even though its the last level its cool. ALso wene you progress in the game you can get diffrent swords. I didnt find out you could get a diffrent sword till Atlanitca. I hope this review was of help to you all."
4,THe Best Game to hit the system since.............EVER!,This game is really amazing. It has a really deep story with some comedy too. i can never stop playin. The graphics are flat out amazing and the gameitself is amazing. At first it might seem really wierd but as you progress the game gets really exiting. This game is alot better then Final Fanasy because instead of having to have to pick your move and then watch the charecter do it you can do it yourself. this game is a must buy. If you go to electronics boutiqe u can trade in three games for a new one thats what i did and it was worth ever game. If u sont want to give in games its worth every penny. GO FOR IT!!!
5,The best game ever! NOT a single flaw,"This was a wondeful game, the graphics were awesome, the storyline was perfect; the end made me cry! I am really hoping for a second game, the end makes it seem that there will be another but I'm not sure. Its a challenging and addictive game, I strongly recommend it! You will not be wasting your money!"
5,There are gonna be a lot of sequels!!!!!!!!,It's me again I still wanna the secret ending. For any considerate out there. And I also would like to tell you that there are gonna be 8 more kingdom hearts games. Unluckily one fo them is a gameboy advance version kingdom hearts called Kinkgdom Hearts:Chain of Memories. Let's hope the other 7 are sequels to the awesome ps2 version not that they waste it on other crappy consoles. So let's hope they stick to the ps2 sequels. One of them is already being made besides chain of memories and it's a sequel to the ps2 version!!!!! I hope that because I was so considerate to give you all this sweet and crappy information you tell me what the special secret in exchange. PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS!!!!!!!
2,One of my favorite games,"This is, by far, one of my most favorite games! The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is unbelievable, the music is beautiful and the plot is totally original. This game is practically incomparable to any other game!!! If I could give this game ten stars, I'd give it twelve!!"
5,"Just a prediction... ""I see a winner""",Most memorable Disney characters on the planet... 1 starAdventuring in the A Nitemare Before Christmas world... 2 starsInteracting with long lost Final Fantasy heroes... 3 starsDesigned all on a blank canvas... PricelessFor all your Gaming needs look no further then SquaresoftProud sponsor of everything good in gaming
4,Disney rules,"at first i thought this game was going to be corny, but to me its the best game I have so far! It has no cussing and an awesome storyline. It's fairly easy to beat(I beat half of it in a week)but it'll keep you glued to the screen. Squalls new look is great, but the only thing that gives it a 4 is it's legnth cause the battle system rocks. This beats all but Final Fantsy 8 hands down."
4,This game is overated,"This is game is waaaayyyyy overated. I found myself having to push my way thorugh the game. only reason it got 3 and 4 stars were beaucse of the side-quests.Also the secret movie is a rip! i got all 99 dalmations, won the hade's cup, and sealed everyworld!.took sooo much time and it was rip."
4,This is the best game since Final Fantasy X!,"This game will make you laugh, cry, and really into the story. The graphics, the music and the voiceovers are great and couldn't have made it better. Of course there are some problems with the camera, but it won't hurt you that much. It's still good. There are some dark tones in the game that are different from Disney movies and related to Final Fantasy games, but this game has the best ending ever that will make you want to know more about the world of Kingdom Hearts. So what are you waiting for. Buy the game and play it for yourself. You think this is kid's stuff? Wait 'till you go though the game and to the ending. You'll be surprise. 'Cause one thing's for sure, RPGgames don't get better than this."
1,Not worth your time,"If you're by any means a seroius gamer, this is definitely a big waste of your time. I'm not quite sure whether it's rated ""M"" or ""T"", but it's a silly game, based on characters from other games and the whole thing doesn't make much sense."
1,Stressful times by a britney fanatic!,"No, I didn,t like any of the versions, I havn't played the fan or game boy advance version, YAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNN, I mean I am playing kingdom hearts right now, and its SSSSSSOOOOOO, BOOOOORING!!!!! I am on the beach on the game trying to find a coconut.............. Who knows a game with britney in, i wish she was in kingdom hearts but theresa rumours shes in a rare version what is it i want to know as i am so boooored right now!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"""THE KEYHOLE""???","WHAT DOES DISNEY HAVE TO DO WITH FINAL FANTASY? (...) FINAL FANTASY IS BIZZARE, STUIPED, AND DOSN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL. PUT THEM TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE TOTAL CONFUSION. THE STORY IS OK. BUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF GOOFY AND DONALD DUCK WITH A SWORD IS BEYOND STUIPED. I MEAN, COME ON! IT'S STUIPED THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT WITH KEY! THE GAME IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BE BEATEN. THE ""UNDER THE SEA"" WORLD IS VERY HARD. I HATE SWIMMING GAMES! THE SEA WITCH IS EVEN HARDER. THE ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND"" WORLD IS VERY STUIPED! AND AGAIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A KEYHOLE IS.FIRST OF ALL, DISNEY HAS THE STUIPEDEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME. IF YOU PUT MOVIES LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND OR PINOCHIO INTO A VIDEO GAME, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT SOMETHING TOTALLY STUIPED WILL HAPPEN. FINAL FANTASY IS A LITTLE BIT TOO CHALLENGING. ALSO, THEY COME UP WITH THE WORST NAMES I CAN THINK OF. IF THIS VIDEO GAME IS GONNA BE HARD, IT SHOULD AT LEAST BE RATED T.DO NOT GET THIS GAME. NO MATTER HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE!"
1,Squaresoft + Disney = S**T,"First of all u can not use a key as a weapon(even a HUGE key).The game makes every person from final fantasy 7,9, and 10 look like a little pu**y. Cloud can kick Sora's a** any day so can Squall and them other people. The bosses in this game make a puppy look scarey. The game makes Sephiroth (One of the coolest, strongest, evilest villian from fianl fantasy) look like a turtle on his back. The summons aren't powerful, bambi, simba, tinkerbell, and some other pu**ies are a bad excuse for summons any day. (Where did Bahumet and Eden go?) The story line looks like something that came out of the blender. Mickey can't control a universe and white people can't dance i want justice ! (lol)"
1,So Stupid!,"Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion."
1,Worst Game Ever,"Although together it was a good idea, Disney and Square make one of the worst combinations. With repeating gamplay the game gets boring real quick, not to mention the story plot was obviously designed for 8 year olds. If you like Disney games and boring gameplay this is the game for you, But if you like square and are looking for a good game stay away."
3,Here comes Jack!,"While I liked the idea of seeing all the different Disney characters I realized something while playing this game. I am not a huge Disney fan. I like Jack Skellington but he is really a Tim Burton character not Disney, they just hold the pink slip.The gameplay was smooth and the story was interesting but not interesting enough for me to pick up another game and start playing it. Sad to say KH went to the 'to be finished soon' game pile in my cabinet."
5,Awesome Game!,I love the Kingdom Hearts franchise and was excited that I was able to get this game brand new for such a good price since my first KH game was KH2.
4,The game is great except...,"there's a good number of jumping puzzles. And the camera angle can be annoying. But the story is awesome, and the graphics are top notch. With the quality of everything else this game has, it makes dealing with the two issues worth it.One other thing that I like, is the fact that this seems like old school Disney, no [bad] sequels trying to change the characters, just pure old school Disney, where the villans really were nasty, and the heros rocked. :)"
5,Kingdom Awesome!,I received the game quicker then expected which was excellent and the game played just like new. I was only disappointed that the game didn't come in its original case. Overall pleased.
5,Great.,This game is so awesome. It was great when i was tounger and even greater now. Blows most games away.
4,Good game,"I love this game. Actually my sister and I both love it. She's played it more than I, it's like I can't even get on my PlayStation, hehe. But, this game is great. The only thing I don't like is the camera angles, they're annoying. But you get used to it.I can't wait to play the second one!"
5,Awesome.,"When I first saw the television commercials for this game back in October 2002, I knew that one day I would buy KINGDOM HEARTS and play it (even though I didn't even own a PS 2 at the time). Fast forward six months and I finally have a PS 2 and have purchased KINGDOM HEARTS, played it, and beat it.All I can say is that I found the game amazing. The graphics are great, the soundtrack memorable, and the plot unforgettable. The plot of this game is what really sucked me in. I found myself playing and playing and playing until the story was complete.Except, the story didn't end. The game had no catharsis and instead ends with a blatant set up for a sequal. That isn't so bad, except that after playing the game and investing so much time, one expects there to be some sort of conclusion and there isn't. I felt a major let down when the game ended and whenever KINGDOM HEARTS 2 is released, I know I'll have to get that as well. Great gaming!"
4,chalenging,this game is good but VERY VERY chalenging. it's Hard fighting mostly... everything. But it does make me (and my mom)work harder. no one under 10 should play it because they'll play it once and get fed up(so parents if your kid is under 10 and they want to play the game badly try renting it first at your local video store) you have to spend alot of hours playing the game.
5,Don't call me that!!!,"Why did starfishie star call me DIABOTICAL? I don't know what it means, but was it hurtfull? I justv want to know why I was called that, by the way I have also reviewed: britney cds:baby one more timeoops i did it againoops i did it again/luckystronger uk and holland singledon't let me be the last to knowand little secrets!!!! I still love kingdom hearts and look out for my little sister namine on chain of memories review and in the game!!!!"
4,Oogachacka,"kingdom hearts is a game worth playing if only because you've always wanted to beat the linving snot out of that one disney villian (you know who). By now every one has said how stunning the graphics are and they're right but half the fun is running around with the lord of the jungle (tarzan), the dimond in the rough (Aladdin), the boy who wouldn't grow up (peter pan), or the king of halloween (Jack Skellington) just to name a few. Also summoning Simba, Geni, and Tinker Bell is always fun."
4,Visually exciting.,This game is visually exciting and challenging. Wish it were adaptable to a two-player game as well as single player.
4,HAHA to you!,"I just have one thing to say to all of you out there who are whining that Kingdom Hearts is the worst game ever. LOOK AT THE SALES! You are sadly in the majority. Sadly for you at least. Also, If you're going to write a review, at least spell correctly.If you enjoy games like Jak II better than KH (Kingdom Hearts), then go write a review for Jak II. KH is the best game PS2 has ever seen, although some people don't have the attention span for it. That's the only con. Or is that even a con? So in conclusion, if you bought it and you don't like it, return it or sell it and get on with your life."
5,I love Kingdom Hearts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the most cool game ever! I mean, a kid named Sora teams up with Donald Duck and Goofy, and all the Disney characters,like Jack Skellington and Tarzan and Alladin! All of you Kingdom Hearts fans should play this game!"
3,The toddler version.,"Kingdom Hearts is like Final Fantasy but with Disney characters. The story line is weird, I didnt get it, really. The music gets annoying when you're in an area for a long time. It seems to me that Disney used SquareSoft to make Kingdom Hearts a better game than it would've been. If you want to buy this game, please rent it first. I always rent games before I buy it. Trust me, if you don't like Disney characters, don't, I repeat, don't get this game."
3,Fun but not enough to spend [the price] on!,Ok first of all this is a good game even though you may think it isnt just because disney was part of it. The only reason i gave it a 3 was because it only took about 20 hours to beat and collect all the side quest junk... so my advice is just rent it and play it and rent it a second time if you really want to spend endless hours trying to juggle little ghost guys to get your ultimate weapon.......
4,Awesome,this game is a awesome game were any age can play it. the game is easy to use and understand.two thumbs up.
5,Score!,"Best game I ever played, No Doubt! You would think it would be corny with the Disney characters but Nooo way! It has a good story to it, not the most original but definitely makes it its own! I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 2 and Final Mix. Go out right now and buy this game you won't be sorry!P.S. For glimse of Kingdom Hearts 2 get all 99 Dalmations, beat the Hades Cup, lock every single world and get the 10 Ansem Reports!"
