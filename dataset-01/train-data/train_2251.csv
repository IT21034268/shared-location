2,Only needed 1 chapter,My husband only needed one chapter out of this book to finish off the New Frontier series of books. It wasn't particularly good either.
1,Just the publisher's way of getting more money,"When I first saw the gateway series, I was quite excited, imgaing that it will be a well written series that connect to each other and somehow link all the startrek universe together. But as it turns out, it is just my imagination after all. All the story was independent and the last book is no exception. It is basically just seven stories that has nothing to do with each other. The worse thing is that they shouldn't be even called stories by themselve, but missing ending of the six earlier books. Defintely not a book, and the whole series as well, worth keeping."
2,Never again,"It's as if six paperback books were written and had their final chapters withheld and put in a hardback. Actually, that's precisely what happened. ....Except for Picard's journey the previous stories are given the bum's rush as they are hurried to their respective conclusions. After reading Kirk's story I thought ""that's it?"". After a couple of months when the names of new characters from previous books were mentioned I couldn't remember who they were half the time. The writing is good and I would have no complaints if all six stories were published in their entirety with Picard's story last rather than first. ... I've been buying these books as they come out but I will never do so again. If I buy at all it will be when the stories are completely published."
2,A big disappointment.,"The whole idea behind the Gateways series was that at the end of each book the commander stepped through the Gateway. Each book was to be concluded and the entire series resolved in this the final title.Well each story was concluded. But those conclusions were for the most part extremely stupid and played no role in the overall resolution of the series. The final story in the book, the TNG offering does conclude and resolve the crisis presented to the galaxy by the activation of the Gateways. But by that point who cares.If you've been reading this series, just read the last story at the bookstore and save your money on this useless hardcover."
5,It has made all the difference!,"This flash is well worth the money. I take pictures for our school yearbook and we have many times had a hard time getting good pictures inside buildings even with the camera I have. I own the P850. We purchased this for our graduation ceremony this year and it took BEAUTIFUL pictures indoors. We are a small christian school and the graduation is held inside the church. There are many parts where there is little to no light and from a distance, I was able to get great shots!"
4,Nice Flash,"The flash works very well with the Kodak Z980 camera. It is easy to use, has a good range for its size and weight. I recommend this product."
3,Kodak P20 Zoom Flash,"The product is very good but the directions are very sparce. You would think a company like Kodak would provide extensive directions and tips, but that was not to be."
5,Love it!!!,I've used this flash with my P880. Most of the pictures are taken inside home of my daughter. I love bright pictures where the background is also lited. I turn the flash to bounce from the celling. I used rechargable 2500mAh batteries to take about 100 pictures for each charge. So I always carry some extra fully charged batteries too. Just be careful with the hatch door to the battery compactment. It's kinda flimsy. Beside is minor little shortcoming. I couldn't live with out it. Absolutely a 5 stars for what I need.
4,"Your need it for normal working, but it's not ideal","Guide number is correct, but... It's so small ;-("
4,Fun read,"Scarrow's books are great reads. They may not be great literature, but they are very entertaining. He does a fine job of bringing the reader into the action and into the relationship between the more experienced Macro and the bright Cato. I have read all his books so far and plan to continue - great entertainment."
5,Another great book in the series,This is another great book in the Roman army series by Simon Scarrow. Scarrow knows the life of the Roman soldiers and makes you feel like you are there. Well worth your money.
4,Great History of Romans in Britain,"Simon Scarrow has written a great novel based on history. At first, I was somewhat surprised with the rough language he used during conversations between Macro and Cato, both Centurions of the Second Legion of Vespasian. Mr. Scarrow's writing style is very similar to Bernard Cornwell's. The plot is quite straight forward. This novel is also very easy to read. I did not find heavy issues poured into either the plot or characters. If you are looking for a ""heavy"" historical reading, this is not the book.Other than the Roman cultures being exploited by the author, Britain's cultures were also described in (gory) details. The Romans in this novel was depicted to be a highly advanced civilization, compared to Britain. Thus, a reader can vividly imagine all the livelihood of people in his novel.A four-star read. Keep up the good work, Mr. Scarrow."
5,Once Again Cato and Macro Face Peril in Ancient Britain,"With the armies of Rome marching deeper and deeper into Britainnia to bring the Pax Romana to that island, Roman Centurions Macro and Cato must raise and train a force of friendly British warriors to protect the supply lines of the Roman legions. But who is really friendly and who is an enemy just biding his time to strike at the Roman invaders?An excellent read.(...)"
1,Military Romance,"The series from which this book comes is a military version of the kinds of romances purchased by the pound by women romance fans. The writing is pedestrian, and the kinds of military details and references to Roman history are cliched and repeated in each book of the series for the sake of new readers. The unimaginative use of an older centurion sponsor of a younger, ambitious sidekick can be found in any ""buddy"" novel or moview. Unless you're really hooked on this kind of men's romance novel, give it a miss."
5,Hot Space,"Oh yeah, this one has the good's. It's like what Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme) said about Queen's Hot Space album; they have the proper spacings of space between the pulse of the music. Scarrow's tale has the grist turning throughout counterbalanced by the ominous silence of future developments. Forgive another simile so soon but it's like the third album of a favorite band: the first album is heavy, the second album incorporates a horn section and 20 backing vocalists as the artists want to 'explore', and then the artist return to their straightforward format of undiluted music on their third attempt. Scarrow strips it down to guitar, bass, and drums here. They instruments know when to thunder and when to restrain. Read this book for sure."
4,Good classic R&B,I have always been a fan of Arthur Conley. Sweet Soul Music first brought him to my attention many years ago. This album is a good representation of his work. I would reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of R&B music. There are some real classics on this album.
1,sweet soul music,"I am very concerned that the track listing on your site does not match the track listing on the compact disc that i was sent. the track listing on your site clearly states that track #2 would be funky street, and that track # 3 would be shake rattle and roll. these were the two cuts i really wanted, and i am quite heated that neither of them are anywhere to be found on the cd i received. I am ordering another different arthur conley cd, in the hopes that the track listing on that cd will be what is listed on your site. at the very least, from an amazon.com perspective, someone should investigate the track listings on your page, and find out what is wrong, and correct it for future customers. [...]"
2,Not Much Learning Here!,"If you operate on the premise of good business savvy and you maintain a semblance of common sense, this book is a waste of money. It's too basic and there are no revelations."
3,Documents concerning the Irish Famine.,"The authors have compiled a representative sample of documents concerning the Irish Famine. Not only do you get actual reports of the disease and death that is taking effect, but you also get some British authorities discounting the nature and effects of the famine and some blaming the victims for the famine. This is amazing stuff, as you can see the 19th century mind at work saying the famine is a way to combine the small holdings of the poor farmers together. In the process, millions died and millions more emigrated to countries like Canada, the United States, and Australia.This is an OK read. The material is written in 19th century language and the reader needs to compensate for this. Otherwise, you can see the bureaucratic nature of the British Empire as it tries to figure out and fight the famine."
2,Document collection,"While the authors may be good historians and they might even be good authors, this volume doesn't seem to present any of their own work. I'm sure that their work was work, insofar as they took the time to find these documents. But it doesn't seem that there is any value added. Some of the documents, as individual documents, are interesting. But there is no flow, no structure, that adds to my understanding of the whole picture of the famine years. In sum, this book didn't give me much."
5,Great Santa book!,This is a very cute story about Santa trying to change for modern times until finally realizing that he was good just the way he was! Kids love seeing him transform!
5,The Smokies...,Wow what a great dvd of the Smokies in the autumn without the crowds. Makes a great souvenier of your vacation or it will make you want to visit the Smokies. Wonderful gift for anyone who likes the mountains in their fall colors.
1,Images spoiled,"This video is a waste of money. The whole thing is ruined by the manufacturer putting his lage initials on the bottom of all the videos images. I paid for Autumn scenery, not for someones initials, that are meaningless and spoils the entire reason to be looking at this. Its distracting, and cheap advertising at the buyers expense.Save your money and dont buy this dud."
1,GPS User Manual: Working with Garmin Receivers,By the title of this manual I assumed that the book would cover the Garmin GPSMap 60CS. It did not! Therefore the twenty five bucks that I spent was wasted and all I have now is another dust collector.
2,Handhelds ONLY,"A large waste of time for 26xx series and other plug in receivers, not badly written for the target audience, just NOT for plug in units at all. Too bad the title page was NOT better written."
3,Good for using a Garmin GPS but...,"I purchased the book after being asked to process GPS data from the Garmin devices at work. The book may be very useful in practical use of the GPS in the field as that was 99% of the content, but that wasn't my job. For processing data using the garmin program once you download the data, the book had a little over one page of advice. So if you need to use a Garmin GPS in the field, you may find this book invaluable. If you need to crunch the data once you get back to the lab, the book has no value."
4,"Good textbook, but...","...the summaries of chapters are not well-written and do not convey the most important points. Nonetheless, this textbook covers all the areas of neuroscience and the text itself is easy to read and to learn."
5,Great picture and audio,"If I had it to do over, I would - for sure.I thought default picture settings were about perfect to me.I did brighten it a bit to see more detail in shadows.Audio is better than adequate.Price is rightShipper was great and arrived earlier than estimated.(can't trust tracking location, mine said it was still in Ohio when shipper called said they were ready to deliver it)Ok, a complaint:The remote is too skinny and not balanced well - disappointing - but can live with it."
4,Top Segment LCD for Good Value,"Wow, am I glad we waited to buy ourselves a flatscreen TV.So many options yet so little real good advice out there. Ended up buying this Sony Screen (mainly because the DVD-R's also from Sony, as is the home cinema set).Five top reasons to go out and buy one yourself:1. Great colours and contrasts2. Sleek Classy Design3. Not too big, which fits a modest living room/master bedroom just fine4. Easy set up features5. If you hook it up with a HDMI cable (to your Home Cinema Set) you're really offOne minor flaw:1. Sound is limited (mediocre at best); but a medium to up market Home Cinema Set should have that covered.I recommend to anyone, who's still debating which type of LCD to buy, to opt for this beauty. You won't get much more value for money anywhere else....."
2,Great Picture Quality...when it works,"My wife and I got this TV for Christmas. The picture quality is awesome. We initially thought the built in tuner was great too. We could receive time warner high def channels with no problem. Now after 3 weeks, the tuner has died. At first, it was taking a couple minutes to warm up before displaying the picture. Now, it just displays static. Called Sony, and they say it needs a new tuner. Luckily, I bought it from Best Buy so I can just return it to the store."
3,Not up to expectations,"For the price paid, this work was OK, but have purchased more in depth and detailed works. Good first time material to get you started."
3,"A repackage of "" at His Best""","This cd great as it is, is a repackage of Lester Flatt "" at his best( less one Track-Daddy Sang Bass). ""Rollin' in my Sweet Baby's Arms"" and ""We'll Meet Again Sweetheart"" are in fact actually tracks from Flatt & Scruggs early Mercury sessions.Lester did actually do a solo version of both songs at the same session that produced the bulk of this album in 1969. Why they choose not to release those tracks are beyond me. The complete album can be found on the defunct Nugget records titled "" The One and Only Lester Flatt"". I was hoping that this was the reissue of that. It is,but only partially. This is still worth the price but I wish they had done it right."
5,Bush Book A Knock-Out,"Do you find yourself taking President Bush and his administration seriously? You never will again after reading this gem of satire. Informed by extensive research into the backgrounds of these Executive Mansion denizens, the writers of Whitehouse.org have created brilliant caricatures of them. They are careful where they draw the line of exaggeration on which humor depends. They go far enough to be hilarious without going so far as to be just plain silly. At the same time, I can't help but wonder whether the Bush folks really do have some of the opinions that are attributed to them. It's so hideously plausible."
2,Expected more...,I have been a follower of whitehouse.org for a while but I was very dissapointed with this book. It's an interesting idea but the jokes are not the innovative ones that I would expect. It had potential but fell short of it. The should stick to their website and hold off on the books for a while
2,Is whitehouse.org ready for a book?,"This was a less accomplished political satire than I'd hoped, and I'll admit my expectations were high based on the website. I thought the ""worker bee"" could have gone farther and been more entertaining and zanier.The content on the site is superior, and it's possible that the authors aren't ready yet for good content to translate to an entire book."
1,I didn't like it.,"This book was boring and inane. I expected more from the guy who brought us such a politically sarcastic site. I was hoping to laugh, but all I did was fall asleep. I feel that I wasted my money, but did get a chuckle over some of the graphics. This book falls flat. Sorry!Ken"
1,Nothing special,"I could not finish this book. It's mix of funny and boring but it makes you think - one year of Obama and popularity rating is going down sharply every day, more harm done to this country than two terms of Bush, everybody deadly scared asking what next... and loving it!!! ""Actually, we are going down, it's fantastic!!!""People, before 2012 you will be praying for Bush to come back."
5,In Hilarious Humor is revealed the Terrifying Truth:,"I see that the frightened Bush lap dogs have already come snarling. In contradistinction to them, I've actually read this fabulous book. It is - by far - the funniest book I've devoured in a long while. In ripping the coy illusions spun by Karl Rove (and dutifully parroted by our truth-adverse President) into colorful confetti and creating an outrageous, unvarnished version of the Bush White House, this book comes perilously close to revealing the nastiest and most deceitful administration in the history of our great country. While you with howl with laughter, your joy will be tempered by the realization that this book's less amusing, more conniving counterpart truly exists in Washington."
3,Could be summarized in two pages - instead drags for too long,"I read this book first in getAbstract. It appealed to me with its simplicity and sound advice. Plus I did need some tough loving. So I bought the book hoping that there'd be additional advice or some points would be explained in more details. However, the author's writing is just horrible - he has a point but can't deliver. He just goes on and on with unnecessary mumble. In summary, read an abstract and you'll learn more from it than from this book!"
2,same old,"Nothing new here except for the brash writing style and arrogance. Almost all of these types of books start with the idea of personal responsibility, as does this one."
4,great read,"I recommend this anyone wanting to improve their life and get ahead, these books are no nonsense type of stuff, all kids in high school should read these by this author"
5,You will love it or hate it!,"I bought one and marked it up... a lot.Then I bought two, one to put in the jhon and one to give away. Now I'm buying another three just to give away to people I care about.For me, it's a life changing book that de-bunks a lot of my favorite and cherished ideas about life that have not worked for me in the past no matter how hard I tried. So, now it's time to try some fresh ideas on how and why things things work the way they really do.If you are not sick and tired of being sick and tired then maybe this is not the book for you. But, if you are ready and willing to change, then do something good for yourself, buy the book and read it... even if you don't want to.I found this gem after reading ""It's called work for a reason"" which I just love to read over and over.Good luck."
2,Wide But Not Deep,"At times this book appears to be just one long rant. Larry address' many issues, but not fully.The influence of the thousand audio books he has listened to is apparent throughout. There is duplicate material found in later chapters of the book that his editor could have done a better job cleaning up.I disagree with some of his statements on religion, and accept them for what they are - his opinion.To drive home his perspective on life and how to deal with it, the audio version, may have benefited from having the author himself present its' contents instead of employing a hired hand.Overall his in your face style, is unique - but not originalRating: buy it used, borrow it from a friend, or check it out of the library"
5,Changed my life! It should be rated five hundred stars!,"I can honestly say this book changed my life. I lost 200 pounds, am writing my own book, improved my health and my relationships, changed to a happy career, and did it all. Larry is the best! This book makes you take responsibility for yourself and kicks your butt! I love Larry's no nonsense message and that he speaks the truth. I wish I could buy this book for everyone. My husband read it too and we are on our way from being broke to multimillionaires. Please buy it!!"
5,Kick in the butt!,I love this book! He has a very direct and no nonsense method for delivering the message about getting it done. You may wince while reading some sections of this book because of the truth of it.
1,Bad Advice,"I've read several of Winget's books but this one I am going to toss. He suggests if you're not happy in your marriage, just get a divorce and says it is ok for a man to marry a man, or a woman to marry a woman. Of course that is his opinion but this book was way out in left field."
1,Doesn't like other races of people,Has a statement in the book that says people of a different race other than whites are hard to love this book is trash.
1,"Yeah, sure.","I, for example, am an IT guy from Romania (not a bad one, I'd like to think. As you can see, i'm also quite fluent in English !) I attented courses and even gave lectures about modern management, of which a proactive attitude towards things is a cornerstone. I know the importance of one's attitude towards life, so I guess that me NOT becoming Bill Gates, or General Motors becoming bankrupt is all due to the fact they haven't read this book.This is also true for all countries with endemic poverty, corruption (like mine), lack of political stability etc. etc. They SHOULD take control over their own lives, ignorant b..rds.So, yeah, sure ! Buy this book and you'll life will dramatically improve. Larry's too: he will gain another 5 or so $ of your hard earned money.I am amazed every time yet another such book is published and there are enough customer to buy it. I remember there was a guy, I think Dale Carnegie was his name, who, in '32 or '33 (1933 not 2033, silly !)..."
5,My New Favorite Book,"This is my new favorite book. Larry tells it like it is and pulls no punches. It's about taking personal responsibility for you life. I purchased one for a friend's son who just graduated High School and one for my 40 year old daughter. I wish I had read it when I had graduated from High School. It would have saved me years of hard life lessons. After 65 years I have come to the same conclusions as Winget talks about in this book. Many young people today expect that they are going to be taken care of forever, either by parents or by the government. When they finally have to confront the hard facts of life they are in for a shock. Read about it in Shut Up and take control of your life and be prepared before the shock of reality kicks you in the butt. Highly recommended."
3,"Not what you would expect, but its a good read....","I found the book to be just ok, and the reason I give it 3 stars is because I was expecting more from him than the typical stuff I've read else where. He had a lot of common sense stuff (Common sense is an oxymoron nowadays) that he ranted about, but he also had some very focused stuff that I felt would be very beneficial to people. I guess what I'm trying to say is give the book a chance you may enjoy it, but don't expect him to give you earth shattering advice..."
2,comes off like an infomercial but...,"I can't see that this book would hurt anyone thus the 2 star review. People are a little oversensitive and I think that Winget proves that by irritating some of the reviewers here.1. What I was hoping for: A truly motivational book that gave me some ideas about putting an action plan into place to get more done - more work, more cleaning, more of my writing.2. What I got: Some reminders that there really are people in this world that don't know that we are infact responsible for our lives and actions.I do believe that this is really common sense stuff. I know I'm not stupid but I am lazy and still don't give a damn. It IS up to me to make changes. Most people who can rationalize know this already.If you don't know that you have to work harder to get more or do to get results, then you should DEFINITELY get this book. In fact, it's available at netlibrary in wma format if your local library participates. That's how I got it.Good luck."
2,Nothing much new here,"I thought that there might be something new with this approach, but really he has just taken the ""no excuses"" model and tagged it on to the underlying approach of every other self help book out there.I suspect he would be fun to see as a speaker since I'd bet he is outrageous in person. But don't waste time on the book.Just put a note on your computer : ""Don't whine. Don't complain. Suck it up and walk it off"". Good advice, but obvious."
1,"shut up, stop whining, and get a life","a friend bought the book and insisted it was brilliant. This guy is saying the same exact thing as all the other self-help books, but he just rearranged the words. And he is not funny. Save yourself some cash"
1,Blah blah blah oh and I'm so tough,"Larry Winget is known as The Pitbull of Personal Development and boy does he not let you forget it. He seems to spend more time talking about his confrontational style than he spends giving actual useful advice. Basically you get a couple paragraphs of advice you heard from every other self help nut, then a couple pages about how tough Larry Winget is.If the author was half as tough as he tells you he is he wouldn't have to spend two pages reminding us after every two paragraphs.Take out the author's tough guy shtick, which gets old after the first two pages, and you have yourself a regular old self help book with the same common sense advice.If you're overweight, stop eating so much and exercise.If you're in debt, stop spending so much and don't use any more credit.If your girlfriend dumped you, get over it."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"After hearing numerous people rave about Winget's speaking talents, I was anxious to see what all the excitement was about. All I can say is that the book doesn't live up to all the hype. Winget's ""I don't care what you think, I know better than you"" rant gets tiresome after about the tenth repetition. Interestingly, he admits that he has been a multiple failure in his professional life until becoming a motivational speaker; I can't help but notice how motivational speakers spend a lot of time telling us how to succeed without much evidence that they succeeded at anything but talking. Winget's New Age prattle tends to get in the way of much practical advice, and any advice that is proferred (quit watching television) is contradicted (he admits to spending his mornings watching TV). Take a pass on this one."
5,"Excellent, Wonderful, Just What I Needed","This book is really good. Straight to the point. No psychobabble. No touchy-feely woo-woo. Yes it stings to read it. But the no-holds barred approach is really unique to self-help books. The only other book I've read like it is Psychology of Call Reluctance by Dudley & Goodson. I guess it takes books like these to cut through the crap and get results. If you've grown tired of sleaze balls like Jeffry Gitomer and weary of braggards like Tom Hopkins, Larry Winget's kick ass book may be just what you need. A straight up shot of reality. Excellent book."
2,Expensive kindling for the fireplace,"Real disappointment here. If you're looking for any kind of consistent reasoning or argument, don't bother with this book. On his blog, Winget describes himself as a ""fiscal conservative"" who voted for Obama and is OK with paying more taxes. In this book, he goes from bashing most of the motivational speaker/self-help crowd (""motivational mumbo-jumbo"") to feeding the reader New Age claptrap (""God is the Presence of Good and the Action of Love""), while dumping on mainstream religion, in the space of about 30 pages. Add in a bunch of ""power of positive thinking"" rhetoric and some generic health and fitness advice and you have (according to the cover) a ""National Bestseller"". You've got to hand it to him when he says ""Some of the best-selling books today are total garbage"" (p.111). He's apparently talking about his own product. It's a $12 firestarter for my fireplace."
2,Moderately interesting,"The author provides warm, reflective, from-the-frontlines commentary on being an English professor at a small college who is also a Catholic, a father, a person with chronic health problems, and an unambitious researcher. If not many of those identifiers apply to you, don't bother with this book; it is written from a highly personalized perspective. For more widely applicable help, I recommend Robert Boice's Advice for New Faculty Members or Emily Toth's Ms. Mentor's Impeccable Advice for Women in Academia.instead."
1,Cheaply made cable - connections will break,"We have a HP Laserjet 5MP (that works superbly even after 8 years of steady use) that we had hooked to our Mac G5 with this cable. This cable does work fine IF you DO NOT unhook it from the printer EVER, EVER, EVER, not even one time. If you do (even if you are VERRRRY careful) the cheap connections inside the boxed part come un-soldered therefore reducing this cable to garbage. There is no fixing it. We have been through 3 of this brand of cables and are now moving on to another brand. Please be aware of this issue. On the positive, at least this cable (and ones like it) is a cheaper solution then buying a new printer.6ft USB Parallel Printer Adapter"
3,It might have been great...,"The good news: this is the ONLY cable I could find that would work with a Mac, almost all the others are PC only.The bad news: if you have an Epson 2200 you still can't use it, because the cable comes with a thick plastic casing around the Parallel plug so it wouldn't fit into the printer outlet until I cracked open the casing a bit and jammed it on. (Then I still got an error response, but that may be because my printer sometimes has issues, not necessarily the fault of the cord.)But 3 stars for making one of these that will work with Mac. Thanks."
3,Helpful resource,This was recommended by an an acquaintance and has some helpful therapy activities. Activity results are recommended by personal accounts.
1,I'm shocked and appalled...,"I'm slowly going deaf at 44, so I'm looking into many different medias for self teaching. I was excited about this dvd, but when I started it I was appalled that there were no captions. I don't know enough sign language nor can I hear well enough to get anything from this. So - if you can not hear, don't bother getting this dvd!"
4,Nice product,"Lots of vocab on this DVD, but not enough to really start putting sentences together. It's a great introduction to sign language. I recommend it."
1,Don't buy this.,Not a great way to start out learning sign language. Very confusing and the DVD doesn't make it possible to skip the extra long introductions. Returned this! No good.
3,Doesn't fit a 1997 Civic perfectly.,"In order to install you have to undo a couple bolts on the strut tower and replace them, and even then the whole thing is crooked and pulls on the rubber stopper causing it to crack."
1,USELESS BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT IS WRITTEN ON! NOTHING OLD SKOOL ABOUT IT. JUST ANOTHER WORTHLESS RAG TRYING TO SELL NEW PARTS. NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM WOLFGANG PUBLICATION. THEY ARE ALL JUNK. I WOULD GIVE YOU MY COPY FOR FREE, BUT I ALREADY USED TO LINE MY GARBAGE CAN. BUY CHOPPAHEAD DVD INSTEAD. THEY ARE REAL OLD SKOOL BOYS AND BOBBERS."
3,Meh,"I actually happen to like this. I thought, cheesiness aside, it was fairly well done. I actually think the Quartet's version of Kody stands on its own.However, what really peeved me was that the track listing was completely messed up. It didn't strike me as being a very respectful tribute if they couldn't manage to get that straigtened out.Overall, intriguing, but not wholly satisfying."
1,Not what I expected,"Being die-hard Matchbox 20 fans, we were pretty excited to hear this CD, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. I guess there is not much you can do with a quartet, I thought the arrangements sounded ""cheesy""--we laughed at how bad it was."
2,Disappointing,"Ok i am a die hard M20 fan. I went to there concerts, have all of there CD's, including the Original Tabotha's Secret released in 1993, and this cd just plain [,,,]. I might listen to it again sometime, but i really thought it was a waste of my money. Its such an empty sound, as it is not a full orchestra. Just four people, each playing a different intrument areon it. I was expecting more really, and a few songs really disgraced the originals. If you like Matchbox 20 don't buy it, but if you like the horible sounds of a string quartet, then you should get this one"
4,"Good product,","Look nice on my Honda Accord, very easy to install, ok quality, but it could be a little cheaper but it does the job well"
4,Great saw - lots of custom assembly required,"This is the second of these saw packages we purchased for our construction company. The tool is a real workhorse and a great value with all the things that come with it. But... it took one our guys a full day to put it together because the extension side table when screwed into the saw sat 3/4"" higher that the table saw top and the screw holes were such that if the bracket was screwed in it would not be parallel to the edge of the saw table. There were no directions for that part of the assembly so we sent our man to look at the other saw we have in service. We ended up drilling and tapping new holes for the brackets that support the press board table extension. Perhaps we missed something or got a wrong part but without instructions and a diagram there is no way to tell."
3,Black and White Pictures,This book has large black and white diagrams of various knotwork figures from the Book of Kells. They are clearly presented and useful for reproduction.
5,Yoga for Wimps,"This book is very good for those just ""thinking about trying"" yoga , on the fence and flirting with the idea. It's a great book as well for people that have a problem back . Great for anyone of any age as an introductory . It works for me !"
2,"Low on theory, low on production values","This book is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe. It has no ""theory"" at all, just an apparently random set of disconnected postures. The production is at the bottom end of commercial products. A number of private jokes among the participants, but not very much for a buyer."
3,Ma Belle Marguerite/Guetary,"Delightful, intimate, charming. Includes the actual dubbing tracks for his songs from ""An American In Paris,"" including the vocal from the outstanding Folies-style number, ""I'll Build A Stairway To Paradise."" Was there ever a more stylish song and dance man, than the Georges Guetary we see in that movie scene?Interestingly, in his duet with Gene Kelly, ""'S Wonderful,"" Mr. Kelly seems strangely threatened or desperately competitive with the ineffable Mr. Guetary. I was as shocked as Mr. Kelly to find someone more charming than he.Most of the songs are in French (I think it's French!) but this does not hamper my enjoyment of the disc."
4,A slight poem,"I've read this book a time or two and looked up words I thought I knew. They're sometimes long, sometimes arcane and even sometimes quite inane.Didactically its well diffused. It's only we it leaves confused. Just when you think you've got the plot, you find what's plot is really not.And here's a clue that's truly droll. Wallpaper seems to have a role. Perhaps it's meant to be the paste that makes diffusiveness a whole.Yet it's a Dickens of a story, and we know, of course, it's a-la-Gorey."
4,Newest Gorey book makes great xmas gift,"Though the storyline is somewhat re-hashed, Gorey's drawings are delighful. A must-have for any real collector."
3,Good interpretation with illustrations below par,"I LOVE Ed Gorey's work and have a growing collection. His attention to detail, symbolism, word usage and dark humor are all hallmarks.However, I was a little disappointed with the ""Haunted Tea Cozy,"" which I received as a gift. This is a clever, witty interpretation of ""A Christmas Carol"" and is vintage Gorey with regard to the text and choice of characters.However, the drawings were just not as sharply detailed as Gorey fans will be expecting. I don't want to place blame with Mr. Gorey (this work was first printed in magazine form a year before and maybe the loss of crispness, hatching etcetera was due to the printing).If you are an avid collector you will still want it and if you like the story or Mr. Gorey's writing it's worth the money. Nonetheless this is the first time I can say that I felt slightly cheated with a Gorey work."
2,not his best,"I really enjoy most of Gorey's works, usually because the pictures are wonderfully creepy. In this book, the images lack teh detail that you find in so many of Gorey's other works. The story, a strange ""Christmas Carol""-like thing, doesn't make the book worth getting, without better pictures to back it up."
4,How to dispose of 30 minutes of the 12 Days of Christmas,"Edmund Gravel traverses through this quick but enjoyable read by Edward Gorey, including his great illustrations. A bug-like creature leaps from Edmunds tea-cozy and takes him on a Dickens-like ""Christmas Carol""-like journey. The stories are sad, depressing, and amusing all in one. Great holiday entertainment, and a great gift for the scrooge who has everything but this book."
2,Disappointing,"The story was up to snuff but the art work was very flat. Not the Gorey-ish style that I like. Is the grammatical faux pax, ""her husband's were the brains"" a swipe at a low country accent or a computer spell check error?"
2,NYY towel,The quality of this towel is terrible! The towel is very thin and it faded in one wash! Not worth the price at all!
3,Thin,"Very thin towel, but it does the job. Does the job of showing my support for the New York Yankees."
3,Good Decoration,"This towel is only good for a college dorm room wall, or to separate your bottom from the sand. Otherwise as a bath towel it's pretty useless.The fiber side is way too rough and thin, and the image side is too soft.A good bath towel should have just the right combination of softness and thickness(fluffiness), which this does not.Plus the color is actually more navy blue than black."
4,A Filthy Commercial Success...,"You Chumps that complain about what is or isn't on a compilation are pathetic. If you really like the Stones then you already have everything good. If you rely on someone else to tell you what's worth having or important, then you're just a sucker that's ripe for the taking. Buy, borrow or steal the original whole albums(remastered) 'cause there's ALWAYS great stuff on 'em that doesn't make the ""greatest"" hits or box sets. I give this 4 stars for the songs but leave one off for thinking we fans even need this contrived concoction. Seriously, it's like talking to children..."
3,Lives Up To Its Title,"With the exception of ""Everything Is Turning To Gold,"" the B-side to the ever-forgettable ""Miss You,"" this is a total waste of money. I think you can even get ""Gold"" on that new ""rarities"" thing. Did someone from ABKCO sneak into whoever-was-distributing ""Rolling Stones Records"" and put this thing together? Oh yes, there's a live ""Whip,"" and just-when-you-had-forgotten-how-bad-#1 stunk, there's ""Dance Part 2."" Save your money, or better yet, buy ""Aftermath."""
4,For Completists Only,"Good album, noteworthy for a good live version of ""When the whip comes down"" and a cool B-side, ""Everything's turning to gold"". Also, the continuation of ""Dance Pt. 1"" as ""If I were a dancer"". This album is only essential if you must have everything by rock's bad boys."
5,The greatest of all midsummer adventures,"Now here's a book I really love. I loved it as a child, and at 20 I still find it unique and very fascinating. Jansson's Moomin books are all great, but this one is the most adventurous and imaginative. The dreamy, mysterious atmosphere is something you wouldn't ever expect to encounter in a children's book. A true masterpiece."
5,The best of its kind,"I heard Brettler speak last Sunday, and he was brilliant. I went out and bought his book, and it was brilliant also. I read a lot about the Bible, and this is one of the best books I have ever read."
2,"Denies the ""divine revelation"" view of the Tanakh","Marc Brettler's book is based in the theories of Post-Renaissance protestant skepticism. The proponents of these 18th and 19th century protestant theories considered themselves rationalists and set about to promote the view that the Tanakh was a compilation of strictly human writings and that Judaism's religious roots are strictly a product of ethnic heritage and not the result of divine intervention producing writings of a revelatory nature surpassing the knowledge and wisdom of humanity.Although there are many variant categorizations of the alleged sources by this school of thought, the popular acronym under which all the variants are classified is known as the J.E.D.P. theory."
5,A book for a real biochemistry.,This wonderful text is very well written and organized. It contains plenty of information that many other biochemistry texts do not touch on. Most of the people who have questions about biochemistry can find the answers as well as clear explanation in this text.
2,Not that effective,"It has five languages: good! It has NO dictionary and most of its phrases are worthless: yes! Not that great but the only book with multiple countries... it was pretty good for that, but I don't know if we actually found it. Okay walk around, seeing as everyone speaks English."
3,Great for Britain,"I found this book strong in many general areas, however, it was written for British lawns, with only a chapter at the end dedicated to American lawns. Of course, there's a lot of overlap between the lawns of the two countries, but many of the names of pests and weeds were not those familiar to us in America. Hence, I could identify the British name for a particular weed in my lawn, but not know what we call it in order to go to my local store and buy the proper herbicide."
2,Watch out for Linux support,"This product is advertised as working with Linux, and it generally does. The driver for it, though, requires a bit of closed-source firmware that is included in the kernel sources. Debian-based distributions remove this firmware from their kernels, so Keyspan devices do not work out of the box on these distributions."
1,Defective Junk -- Don't Buy It,"Handset won't hold a charge. Outgoing-message recording is quiet and distorted. Remote message pickup feature doesn't work -- often have to input my code three or four times to retrieve messages. Cheap plastic belt clip is now an optional accessory (which means you have to pay for something that most makers offer for free). And customer service doesn't respond. Panasonic has worked well for me in the past, but they've lost me forever with this electronic turkey. Avoid!"
5,Amazing Phone,"This phone is crystal clear, has cell phone like features and with the add camera it perfect."
5,The Phone I've Been Looking For!!!,"Received very quickly. After trying several places locally (buying several different types of phones), I finally found the phone that has the features I've looking for. Excellent phone."
4,Panasonic 5.8GHZ cordless Phone bundle,"Great phone it has a nice size phone book storage, can be used easily for an intercom if you purchase a set. It has a draw back that it's screen is always lighted, needs to be covered at night if in a bedroom if not works as a night light. It has a great answering machine and can be acessed from additional handsets. It has Skype phone avaliblity. I recomend it"
3,Not always loud,"Depending on the caller or receiver, the volume changes - not during the call, but some people will say they can't hear, some will say it's fine.I like the camera attachement for viewing the baby, wished it had night viewing mode."
4,Great Phone missing minor accessories,"I love this phone since the reception is outstanding. Battery life seems to be very good (we have never ran out of battery). Two annoying accessories are missing. A belt clip is very useful if you want to use a headset. I noticed that it wasn't included in the package but I figured I could always buy one later. I was wrong. Second it is also missing a wall mount. Because I wanted to used these two items and they are not available (I was OK with them not being included), I dropped my rating 1 star. If these two items are not important to you, this is a fantastic phone!"
2,Very Disappointed..,"I was under the impression with this phone I would be able to download the picture and certain music with whom ever called me. well little did I know this did not happen with the phone I purchased. I must have purchased a lemon, even when I called Panasonic, the people act like they did not know what they were doing, so other than that the phone works fine as long as they don't talk about all the other attractions, it did not work with me."
2,"Could be great, haven't been able to use it yet.....","Got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall, I need to purchase a $4.00 part and pay $5.00 shipping and taxes.Now all the specs say wall mountable, not wall mountable with an extra purchase!Ok, $8-10 isn't going to break me, but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall!So, since I can't mount it on the wall, I haven't used it yet!Have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in..."
4,Absolutely worth the money.,"I ordered 2 pairs from Amazon. One is black and another one is chili.The whole quality of the black shoes are very good as I expected. Stiching has no problem. Outsole is integrated. Interior shape looks very nice.While the chili pair has one with some wrinkles on one side, and looks that leather material is not good. But it is OK since it is not so easy to be spotted."
2,Fast delivery but qulity did not meet my expectatio.,The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received.They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects.I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them.
4,Useful book,Gave me a number of ideas I put in practice on my new C&C. Helped me do a better job organizing the crew for a successful year racing.
3,Handy packaging.,This is the type of ingredient I rarely use...and then only need a bit for some subtle flavor. This being packaged in the tube form is very handy for my purposes.
1,"Book is NOT ""illustrated"".","I highly anticipated the arrival of this book so I could learn more about our history and be able to SEE the ""illustrations"" described. Well, big fat disappointment when the book arrived. It is all text, some of which is missing letters/typos etc. There is a paragraph inside the front cover that states: ""How we made this book"" and proceeds to state that it is NOT illustrated for lengthy reasons they proceed to try to explain, and they also state that all booksellers state that on their websites that sell it. Well, I guess someone forgot to tell Amazon, so when you order this book expect to be disappointed as I was. The author claims the software they used could not distinguish between graphics and smudges, so they just skipped the ""illustrated"" part and produced a heavy tome of dry statistics from history, refer to pages with maps that don't show any maps and other numerous disappointments.I am sending my copy back to Amazon as it was not as advertised."
3,Good headphones but microphone is questionable,The sound quality from the headphones is good - better than the standard Apple headphones that come with the iPhone imho. But the first 2 phone calls I made the person I was calling said I sounded terrible. When I unplugged and used the iPhone mic the sound quality improved considerably according to the person I was calling (different person for each call). Like the other reviewers I feel that the ommission of the play/pause + answer/hang up button seems like a stupid oversight. In summary... V-Moda if you're listening... (1) improve the mic quality and (2) add the mic button. Then you've got a winner!
2,"Great sound, poor durability",Very satisfied with sound quality and comfort. Not satisfied with product durability. Right earphone and mic failed after 4 months of use. Waiting to see if V-Moda will honor the one year warranty.
2,"Not worth the money, not a well-developed product","You've heard the upsides. Here are the downsides:1)There is waaaayyyy too much bass. The sound is unbalanced. I've heard it referred to as a ""unique way of presenting the music"" but I think the music sounds plain wrong on these. It's a loss in fidelity, and it can be fatiguing2)The rubber earbud nozzles will easily fall off, so unless you take these things around in the nerdy carrying pouch, you'll lose them constantly.Pass on these!"
5,Excellent Earbuds,"These earbuds take music to a higher lever and the bass is not overwhelming like the boss earbuds and the three ear size inserts give a custom fit for a greater sound, highly recommended, in my book its a buy.Leo."
2,"Good headphones, but no call answer button","I bought these headphones and found that they had pretty good sound quality (although the bass was a little loud, as described in the CNET review), but returned them when I learned they did not have a call answer button like the headset that comes with the iPhone. I've seen some other iPhone compatible headsets coming out with that button on the microphone, so if you've come to appreciate it like me, you should look elsewhere."
2,Missing key feature,"Earbuds are comfortable and the sound is good - but not as good as the Shure earphones (I have both). Microphone sound is also good, but needs to be close to the mouth to avoid the ""talking in a well"" sound. There is no on/off button on the microphone, so you have to screw with the iPhone itself to accept/end phone calls. I would rate this set between 3 and 4 stars if they had that quick button, which I think is a key feature required in a phone/audio headset."
1,A Waste of Money!,"I wish we had more options of headphones for the iPhone!I don't mind the sound out of these little buds. I can even live with the fact there is no ""clicker"" button on it.But I can't stand taht I've now had 2 (TWO) sets of these that have both gone defunct in one ear. I dunno if it's from keeping my phone in my pocket. (although I've done that wih all iPods). The connection seems to have gotten loose close to the jack, results in a faulty listening expereince.I wouldn't recommend these to purchase...and I don't know what our alternatives are, with the exception of the big long adapter to connect other headsets..."
2,Disappointing unless you can sit perfectly still.,"I was excited to find a pair of earbuds that would work with both my iPhone and iPod. After a few uses, I am very disappointed with them.The Vibe Duo earbuds are very comfortable, have decent sound when you can hear it, and are nicely constructed.My sole irritation with the earbuds is that every movement is transferred through the cord--rendering them useless. Music at a comfortable volume is obscured by noise caused by the cord brushing against your clothes. It sounds like you have a canvas bag over your head."
2,"Audio quality good...but, they break very quickly. Stay away.","I sent three pair back over the last 11 months - they lasted between 3 weeks and 3 months. They suck. Stay away!As for the audio quality, great...when they worked.I only use these to walk to work 1 mile in each direction and they can't hold up. Absolutely ridiculous.At least they honor their 1-year warranty, however once that is over I will need to buy from a different company."
3,A so-so toy,"I expected more from this Playskool toy delivers, other phones are just as good for less money."
5,Wonderful show with great music and lyrics,My family loved this show. Our eight year old son kept singing the songs and humming the tunes. He even wanted to listen to it at bedtime. Very catchy lyrics with tunes that keep your feet tapping. The show is full of songs that continually creep into your mind during the day. I often found myself humming a tune or two over and over. Highly recommend.
3,Not the best of the series...,"In comparison with the other books in the Elemental Masters series, I found this one to be the most confusing. By the title, it is implied that the Wizard is the main character; when reading it, however, I got the impression that the two girls seem to be the main characters. I was not sure where Misty was going with this one. I felt that the plot was weak. And in the end I felt rather disappointed with the result."
2,Not so great...,"I enjoy the world of the Elemental Masters, but this book is the weakest of the series so far. The first part of the book is more like a series of short stories, where the first part of each chapter rehashes information you already have.Also, the students with animal companions overcoming the bad guy who is trying to live forever is a plot sequence that I'm getting a bit tired of in Lackey's work.The editing perhaps needs a little work as well -- there were several bits where character gender changed, and some of the grammar was bad (repeated words in the same sentence, etc). Those are minor points, of course."
3,Where's the rest of it?,"As a previous reviewer wrote, I quickly read through the book, hoping to get to some momentous ending. Instead, it just...ended.I love most of Lackey's work, but I think she tried to do too much with this one. Too many characters. Too many ideas. Not enough of what makes her such a good writer."
3,Good book but already know the story line,I found the book to be a very fast and easy read but I was a little disappointed to already have read most of the book. The main part of the book was already give to us by reading Greys Ghost and the other story about Gray.
3,"same ol,same old","This last book was boring because, it was the same as the others in this series, starts out ok, gets boring in the middle, the last couple of chapters some excitment, but not much, was glad when it was done."
4,Another good 'Elemental' read,I found it worth reading this tale - it was very moving and bittersweet in places.
3,Not her best,"I was disappointed in this book somewhat, being a huge fan of the author. I enjoyed the school scenes and the interplay between Sarah and Nan, but so much of this book felt tacked on. The antagonist was a grossly underdeveloped afterthought of a character and the climax of the book just...wasn't.Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining read, and anyone who enjoys the series and Lackey's style will probably enjoy it, but it simply wasn't up to par with some of the other books in the series."
3,Good start. Disappointing in the end,"I enjoyed the first part of the book, dealing with the experiences of Sarah and Nan as they came into their powers. The growing conflict was, in my opinion, well handled, with both the antagonist and the protagonists growing in power and experience, and coming to the point of confrontation. An epic battle is in the making with the fate of magic and creativity of London the balance. And... the book ends. Yes, there's a little more than that, but the end is far from satisfying. More or less, someone says, ""Be nice,"" the entralled personage says, ""Ok,"" the main villainess is instantly dispatched, and everyone lives happily ever after. One wonders if Mercedes Lackey had hit a deadline and figured no one would notice if she didn't end the story.Quite frankly, I'm disappointed, and very glad that I borrowed the book from the library and didn't spend cash on it."
2,Not what I am used to,"Most of the books that I read from Mrs. Lackey are excelent, and I like the elemental masters series, so I thought that this one would be in the same line, and what could be better than a book starring and African Grey parrot, a parrot that I myself own? Well, unfortunatly this book was a large disapointment, and it was entirely too childish for the elemental masters series. I am giving it to stars for the descriptions of the Grey as a ""grey fluffy pinecone"" which was quite charming as well as accurate! On the subject of birds, Mrs. Lackey continued her exceptional eloquence, and I will look forward to her other books, for where else can you find a fantasy author who knows so much about parrots and raptors, and has had first hand experience?"
4,Surprisingly good,I had enjoyed the previous three books and had really high hopes for this one. It almost met those expectations. I enjoyed learning about the inner man. I never suspected that he was so lonely from the other books. I was happy to meet Nan and Sarah. The writer creates such lyrical characters. Another great job.
4,A Good Read!,"This simple but effective book is written for a general audience with interest in managerial, supervisory and leadership concepts. The book is structured as a dictionary of terms relating to leadership. While some readers may like the A-B-C division of information, others may find the book somewhat disjointed, as the format forces you to skip around from idea to idea. But then, as author James O'Toole points out, readers are invited to seek the nuggets that appeal to them, letter by letter. The connective tissue that O'Toole lays between the entries is ambition, which he says is the single pre-requisite to leadership and the one common characteristic that all great leaders share. We [...] recommend this accessible summary of basic leadership principles, although hardcore readers of leadership literature might be better off elsewhere."
3,wierd,well i don't know i just didn't get it will look at it again and see if the next time is any better
3,Not high grade jewelry.. but,"This is not something to give your wife on your anniversary, but, I gave it to my niece for Christmas and she wears it all the time. It's a pretty little trinket that looks decent for everyday wear. You just wouldn't wear it to impress the Jones'."
5,lovely,"I gave the necklace and earings as a present and was pleased when I sawthem worn.I believe also,that they could both stand on their own and couldimpact and enhance any summery dress/outfit quite easily.It appeared to be of good quality,no regrets."
2,Not what was advertised,"The book it self is as fine as its content. Which is to say it is an accurate and in depth trip into the psyche of humanity. However it was advertised as ""may have some markings"". This book is at least Half full of highlighting if not more, plus notes.I am not impressed."
4,Read This Book Before You Need It,"This book has massive amounts of important information, though in places is a bit technical for the layperson. That being said, my only lament was that I hadn't read it prior to my diagnosis of breast cancer. Since one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, this is a book that all women should read; once there's a diagnosis of breast cancer, things go way too fast for thoughtfully reading such a vast resource. Though there are books that deal with the aftermath realities of day to day living and the necessities of things like lots of pillows, etc. I do wish this book had touched on some of the practical preparations that could be made prior to surgery. There's a lot to be said for this book, it contains a wealth of information; I just wish I'd read it a year ago."
3,Excellent book for survivors working for early detection!,"This oncology field is changing so rapidly and there are conflicting data coming out. Therefore, her book is out of date before it's published. However, Dr. Love or someone must dedicted themselves to mapping the anatomy of the ductal system of the breast! Her work is presented well, and it is a good resource of those helping new patients, but not necessarily for the newly diagnosed patient."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"This book is the breast bible. I got scared by it. Maybe it is just me. But I want to read something with more positive outlook and easier to grasp concepts. For example, Dr. John Link's book is much better than Dr. Love's.I know she is a pioneer and has done enormous things for breast cancer, but reading about how low my rate of ""survival"" was didn't help me when I was scared so much in the beginning."
2,Donna,"I have to say that I was looking for a book to give me more strength to get through the process, not a ""anatomy"" class as the other reviewers have called this book.That said, in my searches I believe I found what I was looking for in Goddesses Don't Buy Green Bananas. A beautiful book of black and white photography of SURVIVORS and their stories. I connected on some level with each and every one. There is a connection that people with cancer (or people with loved ones going through it) have. It is unmistakable. Gooddesses Don't Buy Green Bananas (come on-great title right??) seemed to capture some of my inner feelings and gave me the strength I was seeking. It makes you smile. [...]"
1,Waste of money other than to relieve stress,"The book is very informative but at time of need when diagnosed with breast cancer only serve to kill hope and positive thoughts when both are very much needed. It did serve well to reduce stress when one day I had a bad day and week by ripping it apart. In that instance, it was the best money I ever spent!"
4,Probably One of the Most Accessible Books,"My only disappointment with this book is that I think the 5th edition is coming out soon and I couldn't wait for it. There is a lot of easily understood information in this book and a lot of great philosophy underneath the content. As a nurse and a woman recently diagnosed with breast cancer, I have to say that there are many significant decisions that need to be made. Being a partner with your physicians in making these decisions is essential - and taking one decision at a time is critical to staying sane through the process. With links to her websites and other resources, this book is a great resource!"
5,Excellent source of information!!,"This book has been an excellent source of information!! I have learned about the type of breast cancer that I have and the options for treatment. Everything that the doctor told me had been explained in the book, so I felt very comfortable in making my choices for healing."
5,Answers to just about any BC question,This book covers most questions and concerns in detail. It is current and works for those who are concerned about breast health to women who are living with stage IV BC and everyone in-between. It is in easy to understand language.
5,Best Breast Cancer book,"I have had breast cancer twice, and this is the Bible on the topic. There is more information than most people will ever need, but nothing is left out. I have given this book to several friends who have breast cancer so that they are aware of what is happening, can ask appropriate questions of their medical personnel and make decisions based on facts. This is a great source for anyone who has breast cancer or who knows someone with breast cancer."
5,Dr susan Love's breast book,"I purchased this book to help my sister working as a part-time interpreter do a better job. I like it and my sister appreciated it, although she did not read it. She lives many thousand miles from me, so I explained the main points to her through the phone. I think every woman should and must read the book. The style is clear, but the book is rather too long for a common person. I wish every medical book had a simple and clear style like this one."
5,Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book:4th Edition 2005,"Excellent book, covering all aspects of breast cancer. Dr. Love is considered the top authority on breast cancer. Her style of writing is interesting as well as informative. It is as if she is talking personally to you."
5,If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer..,"...you need to have this book. It gives you information on everything from breast care all the way to treatment. It is extremely detailed. Once you get your pathology report, you can sit down with it and the breast care book and become informed."
5,Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book,"This book has been a lifesaver for me. I had breast cancer a year ago and if I had a question, I knew I could turn to the index and find the page that would have my answers. It put me at ease most of the time through a very scary experience. I have bought this book for a friend who just found out that she has breast cancer. She, too, have enjoyed the peace this book gives. It is very informative and interesting. I recommend this book to every lady who is told that she has, the scary words, ""breast cancer""."
4,It got better towards the end....,"At first, I found this book very difficult to get into. It wasn't until around page 100 that I got interested. I thought the author moved away from the subject too many times, ie, he talked about his job as a writer. Really, who cares? This book was supposed to be about his daughter.However, the book did get a lot more interesting. I find it appalling that Hillary had to wait 8 years for a kidney transplant, and if the reason was because she was ""handicapped"", then that is outrageous.If you can get past the first boring part, it is well worth a read."
2,Not as great as I had hoped,"Coming from a similar family situation, I was excited to read this book, however, it was not as amazing as the myriad reviews made it sound out to be. While the story is compelling, I sympathized greatly with Hillary's siblings and found Mr. Reston's occasional blase attitude surprising. It does make for intriguing reading, and I agreed with all of Mr. Reston's statements about teachers, and I would recommend this reading to many, just not others in situations similar to the Restons and my family. It hits too close to home."
5,Just like Moms....,"Can't beat this toy for the price. I keep it in the pantry with my broom so when Mommy gets out her broom, baby gets hers too. It looks life-like and not like a toy, so I think that is why she likes it so much. perfect height for my 14 month old (with room to grow)."
5,my grandchildren love their toy mop,I could not find a toy mop in any store and I found it here. It is exactly what I wanted and it came immediately. It is great and the boys love their mops.
4,my two year old loves it,"I really like this tiny mop. My son loves it as well. It is the perfect size for him, he will soon be two. It looks and feels just like a real mop too!!"
5,great,I bought this for my boys. Over a year later it is still going!!!! It's great. They love it. We use it all the time. Also great for washing walls.
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an absolutely great book for anyone interested in ""greening"" their home. Their recommendations are great for the enviornment, for your health, home and save you money!"
5,Better Basics for the Home,"Great reference. Every healty thinking homeowner should have one. I go to it often for everything from cleaning tips to skin care and how to solve the ant problem I had in my kitchen every spring. ""Organic Housekeeping"" by Ellen Sandbeck is also another wonderful book to have on hand."
5,Better Basics for the Home: Simple Solutions for Less Toxic Living,It is a wonderful book with everything I was looking for!
5,Great Resource,"I borrowed this book from the library, used a couple of the recipes and had a hard time returning it. I came here to buy a copy. I will be replacing my chemical products with recipes from this book as they run out. My home will be less toxic and I will spend less money."
4,Going green for everything in your home,"A book I found in the library and decided to purchase because I was interested in finding ""green"" recipes for my home. This book has recipes for just about anything you would want. Cleaning, personal care, pet care and more. It has so much information and so many different recipes, it can be a bit daunting. So, as you read through it, book mark the recipes you want to try first. I love that it has so many options so if you are not happy with one, there are many more to try. It also offers resources to buy products and when you consider that to make a good moisturizer costs pennies, next to the drug store alternative, you will save money as well."
5,Safer home-made cleaning recipes!,"I was looking for a book so I would be able to make cleaning recipes at home that would be easy and inexpensive to make. I wanted to make cleaning products that would leave myself and my home cleaner and safer. With a few simple ingredients, many you probably already have in your home, you can make great and simple cleaning products.This book enabled me to do that and so much more. There are recipes for-cleaning tile-deodorizing carpets-glass-pest control-indoor and outdoor plants-fleas on pets-beauty productsPlus much more. I will NEVER go back to buying store-bought mixed cleaning supplies again!"
5,Pure love,I love love love this book. It is tattered and stained because I use it so much. The work is a labor of love with wonderful recipes and is a MUST HAVE for those that want to reduce the chemicals in their lives as well as stay within budget.
5,A must have for every home,I have read this book several times and it is a must have for every home. Dont be left out in the dark when the time comes and you need this book. Order now!!!!!!
3,Hard to find items...,"I really enjoyed many of the household cleaning products in this book but when it came to purchasing the products needed for the skin care I found it really disappointing. The websites that are given to purchase products (soap bark, plumeria flower essence, powdered Vit A) cannot be purchased anywhere. There are no suggestions as to what alternatives can be used. I am really frustrated at having to spend hours and hours of research time trying to track down these items."
5,Recipes are no joke,"I got this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend because she is interested in non-toxic cleaners. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical that natural cleaners could do the really tough jobs, but one recipe and application later and the 40 year old rust stains in our bathtub are 95% gone. No store bought cleaner, no matter how noxious it was, would pull those stains off and we sure tried a bunch. I'm convinced and looking forward to the other recipes that come from this book.If you want a great resource for a less toxic home, here it is."
5,Better Basics is BEST!,"This is one of the most helpful books I have ever owned. I've bought several copiesand given them out as gifts. I use it more than other book I have. It has informationabout practically everything you can think of that you would need for your home,auto, office, garage, bike care, furniture, personal care products, and how to manufacture your own safe, non-toxic products."
4,If you like Sigrid Harald...,"From the back cover,Buried treasure, children's stories, and mystery figure into Lieutenant Harald and The Treasure Island Treasure, a traditional puzzler. When the caretaker of a large estate died, he left dozens of hand-made maps, one of which led to a treasure. Lieutenant Harald promised to help find the map as a favor to a friend, never dreaming that the treasure was real...My Mother, My Daughter, Me is a story of relationships and hidden pasts, of mothers, daughters, and men. Margaret Maron studies two generations of mothers and daughters, and the secrets that bind them."
4,Scary good,"Like other reviews state, this album does sound like an acid trip set to music. If you've ever done that type of thing before then you'll know what I'm writing about here.The ""feel good"" vibe of the first two tracks quickly gives way to the freak-out that is the remaining tracks. To me, it sounds just like an acid trip. The woman narrator is either on one herself, or an excellent actor. Throw in an engineer who was sensitive to the cause and you got yourself quite an album. You do have to hear it to believe it.I only give four stars, while loving it, it's not something I'll listen to on a regular basis."
1,Cheaply made - look for a better option,"The concept is simple enough and enticing particularly if you're planning to use in a mobile setting (as I was). But be advised, in order to allow the cable to be retractable, the cable is very high gauge/low size = poor quality cabling for audio. Secondly, within a month, the retractable mechanism broke and basically just made it an annoying cable b/c at that point it was full length but had a cumbersome plastic piece hanging on it all the time.I trashed it. Low quality and didn't meet my need at that point."
4,Definitely a must see!,Great Thriller! Full of suspense and a few surprises. Great cast too! I even fell in love with the supporting actors! An ideal movie to watch with your significant other. I saw it first on BET and enjoyed it thoroughly! This is definitely a must see.
2,Not Bad,"Mel Jackson really has a nack for playing guys that you love to hate!(smile) His performance is really the only reason to tune into this weak suspense thriller. Vanessa Williams who has really come a long way in her acting skills, gives a rather wooden perfomance this time out. Tangi Miller's performance seems abit more natural and she and Mel are 'hot' on screen together! Hopefully BET will utilize the talents of these two performers for future movie projects. This movie deals with stolen artifacts, betrayal and lots of cash. I would recommend seeing some of the other BET movies before this one, but this is a decent entry to the series. That is unless you are a Mel Jackson fan, then you might want to place this one higher up on your list."
1,Waste of time!,Just d*mn... I was so disappointed. It was obvious the actors weren't feeling the roles. It was so amateurish!
2,If he could just get over the self indulgence,"Paul Duncan has listened to the whole Nick Drake catalog, and studied Pink Floyd early albums very carefully. He's also gotten into Eno's ambience albums of the early to mid 70s. He's taken all of that and put elements of each into this record.He could make a really cool accessible album if he could just get past the self indulgence. There are only about 3 or 4 tracks on here that feel like they're finished. The rest, sadly, have an unfinished feel to them. If this had been released as an alternate CD to songs to a main CD, then it would be OK.Clearly, he's got talent, but maybe on the next effort, he'll get past the studio experimentation and make a fully developed album."
3,Baby gets the Zapper,"DeWan, Ted. (2002). Baby Gets the Zapper. New York: Doubleday Book for Young Readers. 32 pages. Fiction, Easy. Ages-3-5In Baby Gets the Zapper, magical fun appears all over the house. The baby zaps his toys into a musical party. Then zaps a toy airplane into one he can ride in with is bedtime buddy, bunny as his copilot. They take a ride to the moon, which is "" zapped"" into a cookie. Then baby and bunny take a tumble down in to the loving arms of mom who proceeds to zap the baby asleep. (Don't we wish?). The pictures consist of bright colors and simple shapes. The baby is wearing his pj's and has bright red hair, who could resist? The zapper a friendly fact that even winks at the end."
5,Great show,best show ever action and funny seeing naruto grow as a stronger ninja to save his friends and to become Hokage watching him achive his goals can't wait to see what happen next just wish the english version came out fast on DVD
2,Not worth your money... essentially 100% filler,"With Naruto box sets costing as much as they do for as few episodes as you get, forgo buying this filler arc. Rent it first or watch it online THEN make up your mind as to whether or not you want to buy it. In my opinion, this arc is not necessary and not as good as the main story line. Sure, it is hands down the best filler arc to date for the series (in my opinion) and they even throw in some funny stuff regarding Tobi and Deidara. Plus the arc does neatly tie in to the real story line. But ultimately, the main story stuff is very minimal and you will not miss anything by skipping this set. I will never own this set... but I am so buying the next one! Back to the main story line!!!"
2,Sand Causes Bulkiness,"The description doesnt mention it, but the weights are sand filled bags. When using all 5 of them at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable."
1,"Not 10-pound weights, 5-pound weights","Not Amazon's fault, but Everlast's. Even the box promises 2 10-pound weights, but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights. This is not a bargain, but fairly expensive. Quality is just ok. Not flimsy or dangerous, but not what I wanted, either."
3,weights not as advertised,"While the style and use of the weights were as described in the listing, the weights themselves were actually two five-pound weights rather than two 10-pound weights as advertisedx."
4,the review,"Al Capone was a real life mob boss from the 1920's and this is his storyfrom beginning to end. The author describes the man, Chicago, and organizedcrime in the 1920's perfectly. It's almost like your with Al Capone on his dailyrouts, on the streets and in jail. Money, booze, and women are what gangstersdesire and this is what the book is about.The book was very written, and is very easy to read. The book seams like itis at a sixth grade reading level with cartoons and hand written notes said to bewritten by Al himself. It was in perfect order so you the reader could understand where the story was heading.This book is a good read for anyone who likes old gangsters, prohibition, andOrganized crime. I liked this book because it wasn't strenuous to read and hadgreat info. about Al Capone and his gang. I give this book a four star rating.It's not a five star rating due to the lack of information on his wife and kid."
5,Finally! Finally! Woo-hoo! The best pop album - EVER!,I have been waiting for this cd since I put my turntable into storage sometime in the late '80s. This is one of the all time great albums; a must hear; a must see. Wow. How happy am I? Very. Thank you.
1,"Good design, poor materials","I had to return these because they bent a few times. My Everlast chin-up bar is excellent, but the push-up bars are junk. I am 6' and 190lbs. Stay fit my friends."
4,It just works,"I'm not one to spend much time at the gym, but I do have my vanity.I bought these mainly because my wrists were starting to hurt while doing push-ups. I did have the opportunity to use the rotating perfect push-up things and they work great but these work just as well for me and are cheaper. Also, these are the coolest looking push-up stands on Amazon.Anyway, they work great for the 3-4 times a week I use them."
1,Horrible,Bought these and on the first use one rolled and after a few push-ups. Tried again then one of the stands bent and compressed. Waste of money. I'm 205 lbs and they bent out of shape.
4,great book,"a really nice book with great big pictures of all types of gardens. Had some interesting information, few things to think about when figuring out how your garden will be layed. I was kindof disappointed though, it had listings of all the plants and flowers used in each photo but didnt tell you which one was which.. i dont always want to get online to look up something. all and all a good buy, could be inspirational"
4,Great For Beginners,I think this is a very good tape for anyone starting out withT'ai Chi . I would like her to do a little more with her back to us so we could understand which side she is on as we are learning.
2,Not Twain's best,"We just read this book in our Book Club. All agreed that while there were some entertaining moments, this autobiography did not capture his wit. It was a real ""yawner""."
4,captivating,"I picked up this book without expectations. I was immediately impressed with the prescotts writing style. I was instantly hooked and the pages flew by. Unlike other reviewers, I was not bothered by the author revealing the killer early. To me it made it more interesting (there ar plenty of ""who done its"" out there). I am not particularly interested in greek mythology... or should I say I wasnt until I read this book. I may just brush up on some of the mythological references, now. Thanks to Mr. Prescott for an interesting and entertaining read."
2,Kind of silly and mostly a waste,"After about the first 40 pages, I skim-read this one and read the end. It just doesn't work, and it is clear that it doesn't. Not really anyone in the story to pull for, either, in my opinion. With so many other options out there, not worth reading."
1,Horrible Book.......,"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are lifeless and the plot is unrealistic. Without giving away too much of the book, lets just say the author does not have a firm understanding of ballistics or basic law enforcement procedures."
2,Not His Best Work...,"I had to struggle to get through this one. The plot was terribly predictable and all the mythology references got tiring quickly. The plot seemed to be just one cliche after another...it didn't really offer anything unique. I guess I just expected more from Prescott after reading 'In Dark Places', where the last 200 pages of that book was some of the best reading I have ever done. The premise for 'Comes the Dark' was really good...I just don't feel he tried hard enough to give us a compelling storyline. I would recommend 'In Dark Places' over this one."
1,Slow and boring,"This book was so slow and boring that I stopped reading it after a few chapters. The characters were hollow, their actions inexplicable. In addition, the suspense was zero. I am appalled that so may readers give this book four or five stars!"
2,Boring!!!!,"Although this was not the worst book I've ever read, (the reason for 2 stars instead of 1), it was pretty bad. I didn't care for any of the characters in it. The mythology was boring. In fact, the whole plot was boring. Don't bother with this one!!"
1,You are Great,"We don't get much literature here in Northern Russia, but I couldn't put this book down. One star is good, no?"
5,Nice product,"Great! Easy to install and looks nice. I installed this on my 05 Mercury Mariner, took about 10 minutes. I really like the way it curves with the hood rather than sticking up. Feels very durable."
1,It's OK,Shoes are narrow in the front and the insole is thin but for the price that's what i got. I wear it hoping that will stretch to I can purchase something better.
5,"Concetta, you da flippest","Princess Supastawh is like the mob... or some similarly ""ill"" adjective. She's the post-modern answer to a lot of unasked questions... packing more Beck/Ween style irony than a dozen boys twice her age into raps so fast and dope that Kompetitors need tongue baths just to compete."
4,A good resource for do-it-yourselfers.,"This book is packed with practical information for homeowners who want to do their own work in adapting their existing homes for the comfort, convenience, and safety of those with various kinds and degrees of physical disability. The how-to instructions are clearly written and well illustrated. It's less useful, however, for those of us who are looking for design inspiration and turning the actual labor over to professionals. Still, at the ridiculously low prices at which this book can be obtained, it's a handy reference work for those who want an off-line source of -- for example -- where and how high (and how many) grab bars should be installed to provide an ADA-appropriate bath or shower. Architects and contractors will turn to other sources, but DIYers will find value here."
3,Accessibl Home,"This is a good book. I was primarily looking for a book on adjusting your home for aging and this book has a lot of pages on people with disabilities and just a few on aging. However, it is worth getting for a do it yourself type person. It has pages on the tools you will need, color photos how to make changes in both the home and outside garden and even a section on funding sources."
1,What Tito Puente was not,"I have a number of Tito Puente, Mongo Santa Maria, Machito, and other great Afro-Cuban musicians albums. I thought this complilation would add some titles I haven't been able to locate. What a disappointment. Ran Kan Kan, which I remember hearing as a child, is not the original recording. Instead a second-rate cut. This continues throughout the disc. The best part was the liner notes, which praised Tito's fantastic album, Tito in Purcussion, yet a cut was not included. Stay away from this one."
4,More Than Anything,"Kevin Kern's Best Of... is one of the most beautiful CDs I have in my collection. A wonderful 14-track compilation of some of the enchanting, soothing piano solos he has become famous for, this CD is soothing, melodious and enchanting, exactly what anyone needs after a hard day in school or at work.Kern's music does not deviate from his New Age roots - there is still the fair amount of humming and the genteel of the tunes are much different from what is on other piano CDs out there.It is wonderfully crafted, from a true master, and it brings a smile to anyone's face. This music is a reprieve from busy business worlds and brings to life a whole other world of magic and enchanting song."
3,more than words,The seller sent the cd when he said he would it was in very good condition . I would order from him again .I did not care for the c d as much as I do another one I have by same composer that is my personal taste .
3,Not the greatest compliation album,"but it does have my signature hit, ""Come On Eileen"". This is one of the few one hit wonders that I like on this album. There were a lot of other songs from the 80's that I would have picked over ""I ran"", ""Words"", ""Tuff enuff.."" Enough said, the first half of the album is very good, but then it just starts to lose steam. It's as if they were running out of ideas as to what to put on the album. I didn't like these songs back in the 80's so why should I like them now. I guess that is the price I pay to get the few songs I did want.I always loved the show, The big 80's on Vh1. And when this and the first c.d. came out, I bought them together. All in all, not such a terrible purchase. I like the first one much better, there are a better selection of songs."
5,Men of Steel is Fantastic,"This is a MUST have for any acoustic guitarist's collection. With Beppe Gambetta, Tony McManus, Dan Crary and Don Ross, there's something on this CD for everyone. I can't stop playing it! It's a live recording and you can really feel their energy. I highly recommend this one. Some good ol' flatpickin, some of Beppe's cool style, some DADGAD from Tony and fingerstyle blues from Don and that awesome giant Dan Crary's magic 12-string work are what you'll get with plenty of soulful playing. Gotta love it!!"
3,Keep up.,Thisis a greatband. So dont miss this just becuse they are more mainstream then punk.They still rock. and are worth the money.
1,Must do better than this,This book was suppose to be a hardback but it was a paperback and the pages started falling out when I first opened it. I am very upset as I love this book and was looking forward to getting one of my own to read at my leisure and not have to worry about getting it back to someone or a library. I hope they try harder in the future to get peoples orders right.
5,the best story i ever READ!,"It's adout a girlwho doesn't know if the best 3 days of her life were a dream or reality. Here is a quote from the book "" I could her my husband calling me from a distence. His cousin was on top of me saying Ha He'll be to late by the time he gets here i'll have been his wife's lover and murder"" this was the 4th victoria holt book i read."
2,what was she thinking?,"the idea was good, but executed extremely poorly. The main character had absolutely NO personality.in fact, i found it extremely degrading to women! the ditz spent her entire life looking for a man she only knew for barely a week! please! despite this, it was STILL pretty bad. the climax was anti-suspenseful, and the book was predictable as a whole. its one of those cheesy love novels were everything ends happily ever after. i notice that alot of her novels follow the same pattern- naive woman falls in love, marries, doesnt trust her husband, leaves him, has a baby, reunites, lives happily ever after. if your into cheesy youll like this, if youre not, dont bother..."
3,Stuck with me for decades,Read when I was young. It was romantic but some pagan ceremonies. I reread this. I wondered why it had stuck with me all these decades. I find it charming in a different sort of way. I'm not sure why. It does keep you on the edge until the end. Does explain some of the old customs and medieval beliefs from the Black Forest. It does have happy ending. I'm not sure if I'd rate it a 3 or a 4.
4,"A little predictable but,",On the Night of the Seventh Moon by Victoria Holt is a little predictable...but predictable works for me. I am a sucker for happily ever endings! What's wrong with that?
4,Simple book... can't wait to try!,"This is a simple little booklet that I bought because I needed just a few more dollars so I could get free Super-saver shipping! But, I really wanted to get a simple recipe for sourdough bread. (I also bought a book on making earth ovens, so I can't wait to build my oven and try this simple recipe!) If you're totally new to sourdough, this will be something to get you started. Don't expect anything spectacular... hey, what do you want for $3.00! It was worth the $3.00 to me, though."
1,Below Expectations,"Simple sourdough is simply an overstatement. One single recipe and the random musings of a bread maker barely filling the pages, unless you count enlarged, bold print. I was very disappointed in this book and give it the lowest recommendation. By the time you pay for shipping, you could have easily purchased a book on the subject, locally, giving you the same information, and more. You could also Google the topic and receive the same information for free."
1,sourdough?,"This bread is a long process but making the starter with flour and water actually works. I was excited about the simplicity of it all, even though it took a long time to make actual ""bread"".We love sourdough, real sourdough, ""Sanfrancisco style"" bread. This can hardly be called that. It was dense, hard and tasted like a dog biscuit. Yes, I have made dog biscuits too. Even my dog wouldn't eat it after sniffing it. My husband almost cut himself trying to cut into this dense loaf. Tasteless, unless you like eating plain wheat straw.As for the starter, it was amazing to watch this thing bubble up. Who knew? But I would recommend that you not smell it, unlike the author. It smells like baby vomit. It's not a good yeasty smell but an ugly sour smell.I have never given a bad review on Amazon, but this begged for it. The loaves are now on their way to the trash heap and hopefully the little critters will at least like it."
2,One recipe booklet,"This is a little tiny booklet with one recipe for sourdough. It is too basic for most and I doubt it will help you decide to try sourdough. ""Adventures in Sourdough"" by Wilford is a much superior and complete primer for making you fall in love with this natural baking."
4,Very interesting small book.,"I think this is a very interesting book, and the foreword answers why:""I first learned to love this bread while visiting the Community of the Ark, a utopian society founded in France by an italian disciple of Gandhi. On my return home, a friend tought me how to make the same bread - or pretty close. Some further experimenting ended up with the method in this booklet."""
1,What POW MIA Information?,"This book was VERY disappointing! Other than a very few isolated second hand stories of POW's 'somewhere over the next ridge line' there is virtually NO information on POW's. Lt Col Simons tells some very interesting war stories but that is about it.If you want to read about various women that the Lt. Col. has slept with over the years then this is the book for you. If on the other hand you want some information on the POW/MIA issue, you will have to search elsewhere."
2,"A summary for a book, not an actual biogaphy","This miniscule book reads more like a synopsis that the author would have submitted to a publisher as a book proposal, not an actual fleshed-out biography. There is a smattering of biographical information, a few patches of analysis, and not much more. For example, the last two years of Capp's life took two sentences: ""He was suffocating. Two years later he died."" Suffocating from what? Emphysema? Where and when did he die? What happened to his assets?The writing style is uneven, ranging from obtuse comma-heavy sentences filled with sub-sub-sub-clauses, to clear and passionate passages.Either there simply isn't enough source material to flesh out a biography of Al Capp, or this author gave up after finding a few sources.Either way, Al Capp deserves a much more thorough biography, which this author presumably could have written. I give this two stars just because it's the only thing available on the topic."
1,A hatchet job,"It appears the author was one of those liberals in the 1960's and 1970's that Al Capp attacked and is seeking revenge.One of the best insights into Al Capp was a book called A Hard Hat's bedtime story where Al Capp stated he did not switch political beliefs, but switched to the group he felt down trodden which was the working stiffs who supported the spoiled brat hippies and others blaming the older generationWhen Al Capp was a liberal up until the 1960's, the conservative element who he attacked chose to ignore him, but when he started attacking liberals, they chose to censor him, harass him and other dirty politics."
2,Not the real original,"Its nice to have the dvd, but the quality is not that great. besides that are the songs remixed. And the playlist isnt that filled with real hits. If you're looking for that, disappointment. If you want the rather unknown songs, than its a great buy"
1,Never judge a book (or DVD) by it's cover...,"This is truly AWFUL. Like most of Levine's output it is cheap and nasty. As you might have read earlier - a lot of the artists appearing here haven't been paid anything for their contribution/inclusion in this DVD. You might as well go to YouTube to watch this stuff - they're all there and many, many, more gems(?) from the Nightmare/Motorcity labels. Whilst I do applaud Ian for putting The Supremes back together when no-one else was interested, the video here of ""I Wanna Be Loved"" is of such bad quality that I wish it hadn't been included and the ladies themselves (Lynda & Scherrie) were not happy when they saw it. So in conclusion, save your money - watch it all free on your computer!"
5,Don't hate congratulate,"I would just like to start of by saying that ""Jam on it"" is one of my favorite dance songs. It has a good beat and the lyrics are slamming. I'm only 25, but I listen to old schools songs and old school groups and Newcleus is still up there in my book. Not only was ""Jam on it"" was a hit song, they also had songs that people slept over. Newcleus had good music and clean lyrics. Not only did they video play on video music box all the time but they also went on tour with ""Cameo and RunDMc"" Let's not forget some of the new talents that has sample some beats for them too. So yes, don't hate, congratulate"
4,Jam on it!,Jam on it and the Wikki Rap are 2 of the best electro-funk records ever made. And once you include Let's Jam and I Wanna be a B-boy well that's worth the cost of the album alone. Computer Age and Automan are worth listening to but they're not exceptional. The remaining cuts are just so-so but far from intolerable. The best 4 cuts are all worthy of 6 stars but there's enough other marginal material to bring down the overall rating. Nonetheless this is a MUST have disc.
4,Old School Techno Revisited,"At last! One of my favorite groups of the 1980s has returned, albeit a greatest hits album. Although a couple of tracks are different versions of the full length album versions, everything still sounds great! I just wish I knew how good these sounded back then! Like many people, I would much rather see a re-release of the full length album of ""Jam On Revenge"", but this will do.....for now. The staples of the classic album are here, including ""Computer Age (Push The Button)"", ""Jam On It"", and ""Automan"". If you like today's Electronica/Techno music, listen to this and know where some influence for today's artists came from. I should know, this was one of mine. Trust me, this one's a keeper! :)"
5,newcleus,"It was very difficult to find this old release. But now that I've found it, It's on and popping."
3,"Good, smart pop.","When I purchased this item I had never heard of the singer, the producer, or the record label. I heard some samples and decided to take a chance. I was glad I did. Tiffany Clarks' release was a very plesant surprise.Starting with the hi-nrg 'Better Off Alone', a song about waiting for the right guy. To 'Talking To Myself', a very ""smart"" song about those who ask for advice, but who never listen!. Other standouts are, 'Back in the Day', a song about moving on. And in my opinion the best track as far as storytelling in concerned, is 'She Missed Her Chance'. This song would be a hit by almost any mainstream country or pop singer, great song.A good surprise indeed. You can listen to samples at CDBaby. I think you will like it.Thats My-2-Cents. Enjoy the music."
5,Navajo & Hopi Weaving techniques book perfect.,"I bought this book because I wanted to know about Navajo weaving and if I wanted to take a long, expensive course learning how to do this particular weaving. This book not only explained everything in wonderful detail, it was lovingly historical as well. The teacher/author was extremely experienced and thoughtful and I learned everything I wanted to know regarding the beautiful art as a beginner. And I suspect an advanced weaver would like it just as much.It is detailed but not crazy making so I got everything I needed to make my decision and boy am I glad I got the book. I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about this cultural weaving technique and the history. It is the best FIRST book regarding this subject you should get."
1,You guys HAVE to be kidding me ..right??,"If Amazon had a 0 star rating or better yet a Negative rating I would have selected that. This is the biggest piece of junk I've ever heard. I watch the corny ""needy girl"" video just to laugh at how silly they are.If anyone here really found these folks any good or even had the audacity to see them live, you should be tortured by being tied upside down by your hands behind your back and let roaches crawl all over you.As far as a JOKE artist like ""Gunther"" and ""Zlad from Molvania"" I can see how it would be cool in a funny pathetic sort of way. If you truly enjoy this s* then you all deserve to go back to grammar school or Sunday school and let the priest play with your gen I tals again.:-)FLUSH! TEST!!!! MONKEY!! CHICKEN!! BABALU!!"
4,Impressed,"Signed by Vice Recordings, Pee Thug and Dave 1 created the dual group ""Chromeo"". I just discovered them a few days ago by getting a sampler CD from a website I signed up for. It included various bands I never knew made good music. So I pick up the record and this is something I'd recommend to ANYONE!!!! Out of the 12 track list the ones that are good are of course, ""Mercury Tears"", ""Needy Girl"", ""Overdrive"" and of course there are others that are worth the listen. There music is pure funk of diverse sounds and deserves to be heard from many."
3,One good song,"Everyone says this is an old school funk album. It's corny like a Cameo album. I bought it for the song Rage, and I truly thinks it sounds better on the Burger King comercial. Must have been a remix. I will say this, the robot- voice vocals are pretty cool, and some of the synth sounds remind me of some old school funk, but it lacks the grease of P-funk and rump shake of Zapp. I don't think this album will get you laid."
1,Sumrall's books are more revalent,"After having read both books, i have found that Lester Sumrall is the more informative on the subject. His book ""Demons, the answer book"" shows the believer how to take authority thru Christ.Whyte has a tendency to be a little ""off the mark"" in my opinion."
5,Truth that sets us free indeed,"Great book and a classic from a fine minister and preacher of The Word.Established in the timeless truth of Gods word and a great book to help us go back to the power of the finished work at the cross, great for study, encouragement and truth"
5,The single-most engrossing book I've read in years...,"When I picked up this book I thought ""Another werewolf book. Hope it isn't TOO bad""... Boy, was I selling this book short... This was without a doubt the BEST werewolf story I've ever read. It's like ""The Wolfman meets the X-Files""... Too good! Non-stop suspense/excitement! I highly reccomend this book for ANYONE who enjoys a good <great> horror/sci-fi story... NOT TO BE MISSED!"
2,Not the best but not the worst either.,"Having read a lot of werewolf books I don't know how people can call this one the best.McCammon's The Wolf's HourStrieber's The WildSomtow's Moon DanceCadnum's Saint Peter's WolfI am sure I am leaving a few off but those are real good werewolf books.This was just another typical decent guy turns into werewolf, has no control over his wolf form, and kills bunches of people book. If thats the style you like then this book probably isn't that bad. The only thing that really sticks out that bugged me was the cops just letting the reporters walk all over the crimes scenes. Even if the cops were done collecting evidence I just don't see them letting a bunch of people tramp all over the place when there is blood and body parts scattered everywhere.It was a alright way to [spend] time but in a couple weeks I doubt I will be able to remember much of it."
3,Good but not great,"I was impressed with the sound from these speakers (min. distortion at high volumes) but was sorely disappointed in it's anemic bass output. For basic applications, these speakers are pretty good, but if you listen to a lot of music or want the ""big boom"" explosions from your games, you're better off with a 3-piece system."
3,great sound but some feedback,These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up.
5,"An excellent, affordable pair of speakers.","I bought these with my new Dell PC about a year ago, and I have been very satisfied with them since. My music, my games, everything sounds great through them. They look stylish too!"
3,Not great,"I don't understand why these speakers are getting such high reviews from people. They're ok, but definitely not great. They get loud without distorting, there's a decent amount of bass for their price and they're cheap. But I think anyone would be much better off getting a slightly more expensive but better set of speakers."
4,Price and Sound,"For the price at this level, i find it sounds very good, well balanced..., unlike other tint sound, it has quite of a wider sound spectrum without spend 2x or moreComing from a high-end Home Audio, B&W; Speakers, i am quite happy with this unit"
3,susceptible to interference,"These speakers came with the Dell computer my company bought for my office. They're decent speakers, but have no shielding to speak of. I can't have my cell phone, even sitting idle, within ~4 feet of them, lest they spit static. I had a cheap mouse for a little while that had an unshielded wire, and these speakers spat static every time I moved the mouse unless I had the mouse cord far enough away from the speakers. The volume changes a lot for a small turn of the knob, which is a little annoying, but not critical. I've never really pushed the speakers to any loud volumes to check that end, though."
2,decent sound with some problems,"These speakers are okay as far as sound goes. However, one major flaw is the tendency for one of the speakers to go out. You can get it going again if you have a pair of headphones and you jiggle the plug around inside but it's very touchy. All and all it makes for a very annyoing listening experience."
5,This book is great!!!!!,Flowers in the Attic is the best book. It is horrifying and romantic. I read it 3 times I loved it so much. Definetley give this book a try!
5,The Market,The fine illustrations show marketplace details showing a lifestyle very different from ours. The story is entertaining to children because of the mischevious goat. I bought it for my grandchildren because I want them to understand that there are many styles of living.
1,Crap,"I just bought this record, because the guy at the music store told me too. I should go back and shoot him, this cd sucks."
1,Awful......,"East West's ""Hope In Anguish"" is one of the worst CD's I have heard. Period. I listen to just about everything, but when a band abuses horrible power chords, bad drumming, and the stereotypical 'metal' voice with a bunch of 'dark' cliches, it just makes for bad music. This album just doesn't cut it, and it's enough to make me steer clear of the rest of their stuff."
2,junk,"like others hav said, this cd doesnt hav christian lyrics and the music is simply pitiful and i dont like the singing (or yelling)"
1,Mixed Messages,"First I want to say that I really do like this cd. It's hard, all of the songs sound different, and well the vocals are amazing! If this was a cd on a secular label I'd have no problem, however they are on a christian label. Now none of this stuff might matter to you and if so cool--but I would have liked to know this before I bought the album. They should not be considered christian. None of their lyrics talk about God and one is very violent. The corus is ""Hunt them, hurt them, get away"", that's it, no follow up on comdeming these actions in the slightest. Pretty sad--if you want hardcore christian go buy a Zao cd, they don't send mixed messages."
4,The Best of the Velvet Series,"As a precurser, I don't read romance novels frequently, but my summer jobs practically dictates that I have an easy read to pick up when work slows. I have found that romance novels are often terrible, but I really enjoyed ""Highland Velvet"": It made work more bearable.I managed to finsh ""Velvet Promise;"" it was a decent read, nothing special. I read ""Highland Velvet"" out of curiosity, and I have to say I am VERY glad I did. The characters have chemistry, and the setting/historical background held my interest. Also, I think most heros in romance novels are quite silly, but I actually loved Stephen: Deveraux mananges to make him silly, sweet, cute, and sexy.I tried to read both ""Velvet Song"" and ""Velvet Angel,"" but they were huge disappointments compared to ""Highland Velvet"" and I couldn't finish them. I don't suggest that anyone else read them either, but I see they've gotten favorable reviews so feel free to ignore my opinion.Happy Reading!"
5,Beautifully written!,A beautiful and captivating love story that I could not put down. A real treat if you enjoy a good romance.
1,"not my kind of story, not my kind of hero & heroine","After reading the mixed reviews of this book here in Amazon, I decided to see for myself. I think this is a ""love it or hate it"" book and unfortunately, i hated it. The hero is too soft, heroine is too strong. Their relationship is based mostly on stephens lust and bronwyns pride. There is a lot of arguing, throwing insults and fighting physically, which I'll add is more of the heroines doing. Concessions/bargaining is mostly given by the hero. This goes on and on and on... and sounded old and irritating in the end. There's very little romance between them, let alone love. Makes one wonder how they came about that feeling in the end. I will read the rest of the velvet series but I am hoping that the plot and the characters are unlike this one."
1,5 stars for this book?,"WOW. I cannot believe it. People did actually like this book. I would have too if not for the irritating heroine. I cannot help but think she deserves the villain, chatworth, than the gentle Montgomery. Ouch! I really tried to finish this book but I just couldn't stomach it. The heroine is just too loud and distasteful for me. I agree with one reviewer from Moreno Valley, that Bronwyn have too much hate in her heart. That made her look ugly to me. Skip this one and move on to the next book of the series, story of Raine in Velvet Song. I can assure you, u won't miss a thing."
2,No Romance Here,"This is the story of the the Second Montgomery brother Steven and Jude brings the story of the family to life, with great secondary characters. But the Romance between Steven and Bronwyn was a disappiontment, in the end I felt Steven deserved better, and Bronwyn deserved the Chartworth Name (the Villian of the story) rather than the Montgomery Name. Steven was kind and giving, but Bronwyn was just plain selfish."
2,Amazed I got through it,"I gave this book 2 stars only because I was able to get through it, but just barely. The two lead characters don't seem to be in love, only lust, and they are both really annoying people. The other characters just pop in and then nothing really happens, and if it does, like a character's death-it happens and then barely mentioned again. Everyone else is a prop, it's all about the two miserable leads who are really uninteresting."
4,;0),Stephen and Bronwyn what a couple and Bronwyn what a spitfire she had fire in her belly. I Like the second story in the Montgomery saga. This book is an oldie but goodie for me I read it when I Was younger and reading it today I still liked it. This book was issue in 1982 and some books read today does not have the same effect on me. In all it was good action pack nice with some romance thrown in.
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","I enjoyed this book but not nearly as much as ""The Velvet Promise."" I know it's a romance novel, but it was hard for me to really believe that one of the Montgomery men could so quickly and completely change. I did enjoy it, though, and am eager to read about the next brother."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,Bronwyn is so annoying I wanted to scream! She doesn't seem strong to me - just whiney! and cold. Bronwyn just felt sorry for herself.Stephen should have hooked up with Morag. She had some warmth and spunk.Sorry to say I really didn't like this book...I am not even going to finish it.
1,highland vekvet,i never received this book in the mail and i do not remember who it was purchased from. if there is any way you can look into this for me.thank youmichele lutz
4,Strong female heroine.,"I'll be brief since there are some longer summaries below. I didn't discover Jude Deveraux until recently and I am still getting used to her writing style. The first 2/3 of this book is very good - 5 stars, but the last 1/3 gets bogged down with some superfluous characters and redundant storyline. I liked Bronwyn - very strong and passionate (and for once a tall, dark haired heroine!). There was good chemistry between Stephen and Bronwyn when they weren't fighting! This one was more satisfying to me than Velvet Promise, the 1st in the series."
4,An enjoyable read!,"I didn't realize that this book was part of a series until after I began reading it, but it had no effect on understanding the characters or plot. I really liked the heroine in this novel, even though she is definitely stubborn. Loved the hero too, as well as the supporting characters. A good love story."
4,I did like this book,I enjoyed this book and am on to the next one! I'm making it a goal to read all the Jude books.
4,LOVE!!!!,"So Far I have read 3 out of 4 of the series and am in love with them, and have NOT been dissapointed yet! I saved my favorite brother for last! Mrs. Deveraux does a fantastic job of weaving the stories together, you nver miss a beat. Each character is wonderfully discripted and I love that she makes them all flawed in there own ways, no one is too perfect! She has the abillity to capture you and take your mind and emotions on a ride through vivid discriptions that leave you completly satisfied, she doesn't drone on. Love, love, love, love, love these books!"
2,Snooze,"i've read all the other ""velvet"" series and really liked those, this one was so boring i had to skip to the end."
3,Velvet,For me it was a classic Deveraux book but the ending seemed to finish quickly at the end of the book and definitely left me with questions to think about.
4,Nice knife but...,"Nice knife, sturdy and sharp, it works great on soft cheeses as recommended but the Global cheese knife works much better for soft AND hard cheeses. The Wüsthof was difficult to use with a manchego because the blade is ""straight"", the Global is micro and macro serrated which allows to cut through the manchego like butter if you make the correct wrist twist. Even though, the Wüsthof has a confortable and cool design. Got this one as a gift for a german knives lover. For me... I still prefer the Global as a multitasker, which by the way works great also with tomatoes."
1,junk,The remote had dead batteries in it which cost me $15 to replace and the reciever was damaged and missing instructions...... Very poor product and was highly disappointed!!!!!!!!
2,Came damaged,Extremely dissapointed... product was badly packaged and arrived with some of the 'tin cans' on the back broken off.Otherwise delivery was in good time.
2,"I LOVE Mike Leigh, but...","BLEAK MOMENTS was rather disappointing. After hearing raves (from Ebert and others) for years about this early Leigh film, I finally rented the DVD and...to my utter surprise, I could NOT get through it - usually, I am hypnotized by Leigh's mastery of pace, tone, and character, but here, it's really tough going - a long, static, dull, uninvolving slog - all the ""quirky"" behavior just gets tiresome - one to possibly admire in theory/hindsight once you know Leigh's work, but as a film to stand on its own, you're much better of starting with SECRETS & LIES, ALL OR NOTHING, LIFE IS SWEET, VERA DRAKE, or even ABIGAIL'S PARTY...anything but BLEAK MOMENTS which is..er...um...rather bleak."
2,Not Easy Listening Collection,"This is disappointment to me, as hearing Maxwell's playing on Rubbra's Oboe Sonata and other numbers on that CD I sought out this artist's work, to find that she has done sizeable composition.Turns out that the composition is of the nature of aural production, and an entering into the magical world of sound. The composers and their works here for the most part sound very much the same throughout, much stress on severe register shift and dynamics.Two selections I enjoyed were Robert Saxton's ""from a distant shore"" and Maxwell's ""Songlines and Cadences.""This music certainly must be engaging for these composers and the performers who play such. It is not the music that I enjoy listening to, so this CD will collect dust I'm afraid. I'll likely pull it out ever so often, dust if off, and spin it again to see if my listening has changed.Proceed at your own risk."
4,Wires,"Like the product. Sound is good. I wanted a wall mounted stereo. Can you say wires? All kinds! Will have to cut some holes in the wall. When shown in ads, note no wires. When you buy and hook up, note many wires. Wife hates wires. But again, sound is good."
5,Great System!!!,"This executive system is the best on the market! Sleek lines, incredible sound, and funtionability make this an absolute bargain. The added subwoofer makes a world of difference. I have been a Pioneer fan for over 15 years and this is the reason why: incredible products. I set it to put me to sleep at night and to wake me in the morning... and it turns itself off right after I leave!! I was showing it off to a friend tonight and got my first noise complaint in three and a half years!! (I did have it turned up a little too loud) The friend that saw it will be ordering one in the next few days, enjoy, Toby...you'll love it!"
4,Overall a good system,It's a great micro size system for the price. The sound is sharp and clear. I didn't care for tapes so this system was perfect for me. Saved alot of space in my room. I had an older JVC shelf system that I bought 5 years ago (...) The NS-33 sounds better. Only problem I have now is one of the speaker is cutting in and out.
1,There are better things to buy,"(...) It does not match with other pioneer line of products. It's music quality, especially in the low frequency range (Drums, sexaphone etc) is very very bad. However, it could be used as a bed side system"
1,Newbury comics Business Practices are not comical or consecrated,"Last time I purchase anything from this vendor who charged me after taxes over double the price that the same item is now on sale for. When I attempted to reckon this through Amazon, I was given the run-around such that I had to take appropriate actions myself. I am a loyal customer of Amazon. And when treated this way I very much disappointed. This Vendor whose selling practices make me feel taken advantaged of and that will never happen again. Rating does not refer to the item but to the behavior of the Vendor."
5,I am jamming this box right now!,"I am jamming this box right now! Well, specifically, I am jamming ""I Do Love You"" by Jimmy Stewart. I have no idea who Jimmy Stewart is. Luckily, the box that I'm jamming has a book with information on all the artists. Plus there are colorful trading cards for all of 'em. You get nice details that tell you who Jimmy Stewart and the others are. And every song, from the obscure to the well-the-hell-known is good. Gee."
5,THIS IS ALL YOU NEED!,"I also have had this box set for over 2 years, and haven't bought a better investment since! I love the old R&B sound, but didn't know where to start, and this set is the ultimate source you need. The presentation is outstanding, and the music selection is even better. I usually pass on the ""Beg"" cd's (too slow) , and focus mainly on the ""scream"" and ""shout"" ones (dance party). You won't be disappointed... and everyone who hears it will want it, too!"
1,DONT BUY THESE,"This company is a RIP OFF. There are only a few little tiny tablets in this package. This company charged over 5.00 for shipping, when the item could have simply been placed in a first class envelope for .47 cents. It is only a tiny little envelope of tablets! When I wrote to the company to share my dissatisfaction, I never received a response. You can go to Walmart and purchase a whole container of these things for under 4.00. P.S.--you dont need to use 8-10 tablets as suggested (that would be about half of the container)! You only need two or three for color mixing."
4,great all around watch,"This watch is an excellent dress watch, yet not too dressy to go nicely with a pair of jeans.The clasp is easily opened with one hand, yet secure.I was concerned that the darkness of the face of the watch would make the dark gold hands of the watch hard to see, but I haven't had any trouble."
2,Big disappointment,"This book is NOT by Richard Scarry. Rather it is a work by others done in the ""style"" of Richard Scarry. Unfortunately, it falls far short in both words and pictures from the Richard Scarry that I'm familiar with."
5,Excellent -- runs 2 sizes Lrg at least.,"Very well made. Is a little wide for a slim person, but still ok. Got for my daughter who is 5'3"", weight 120 and 34"" chest, but xsm was still too big, so gave it to my son who is 5'9"" and same weight as my daughter ... so he's very slim. Sleeves and length fit him fine, but waste and chest it is large, but works. It was to nice of a winter cool coat for this price to send back. ... Wish they made it in girls sizes."
4,LOADS OF INFORMATION AND ADVICE,"Best Books for Children, 2nd Ed is a book to be valued. It's comprehensive and crossed-referenced. A 560-page reference guide featuring best books for children--fiction and nonfiction-though age eleven. Book information includes: title, author, illustrator, format, publisher, themes and sometimes comments from Valerie and Walter. The themes are single word descriptions. Parents will know exactly what is in the book. The book is divided into parts according to a book's listening or interest level. Also, instead of using reading ages, they use general ranges, such as ""all, baby, preschoolers, early elementary, middle elementary, and pre-adolescents.""The books listed range from the old familiars to the most recent, such as Harry Potter. This is a reference book written with parents and professionals in mind. Wouldn't it be nice to know that your local school or library used Valerie and Walter's Best Books for Children regularly? Why not recommend it?"
3,Other options for this are better,"Compared to other similar books, this book is difficult to navigate and difficult to use.I don't like the way books are sorted - by both a reading level and a listening/interest level simultaneously. So to find books for a 5th grader, I have to go through several different groupings, within which is fiction, science/fantasy, etc.. all intermingled. Very disjointed and unsatisfying.In addition, listings don't have basic information such as the year of publication, number of pages, awards received, etc..The comments themselves were of interest, but no more so than the other books' contents.Maybe it's improved since this edition - I hope so!"
5,A perfect antidote to overheated political rhetoric.,"Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson have given the church in America a wake up call with this book. They remind us that political victories are nothing if they keep people from knowing Jesus. Too often, religious political organizations have done just that. It is hoped that they will follow the brave lead of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Dobson and let the church be the church. I would recommend this book to anyone who has questions about the role of Christians in American politics."
4,Timeless Reminder,"Since politics is in our faces during any election year thanks to the media, this book is a timeless reminder to those who truly serve our God in Jesus. Instead of working to change political parties and value systems, this book is a call back to following in the steps of Jesus. The authors know what they're talking about since both were caught up in using organizational Christianity to win elections and influence congressional votes. A great read in balancing one's Christian walk with one's duty to citizenship."
3,Good insight,"Although I'm diametrically opposed to Dobson and Thomas on most counts, I think that their fundamental insight is right on: by associating themselves with a specific political party, conservative Christians have done their cause a major disservice. The Founding Fathers were perfectly explicit in opposing a state religion, but the Religious Right's political efforts have often appeared to work against this principle, and I think they've scared off a lot of people who might otherwise support at least some of their agenda (shades of the Taliban!). The authors contend that moral issues should be fought out in the arena of morality, not partisan politics, and I couldn't agree more, even though my definition of ""morality"" is decidedly not theirs."
1,SEDITION!,"Cal Thomas has become a modern Benedict Arnold.How can one go from being friends with James Dobson, Billy Graham and others; to this disgusting weasel that has nerve to discredit every christian in America ?Christians better wake up FAST! Cal Thomas IS NOT our friend, he DOES NOT speak for us!Christians more than ever are being pushed down, pushed aside and dimissed as irrelevant human beings. We need to speak up and speak out. As Martin Luther King said; ""Injustice Anywhere is a Threat to Justice Everywhere.""This book is an injustice to all law abiding, socially mindful christians in this country. This book is a kick in teeth to Pat Robertson, James Dobson, Gary Bauer and all christians in america. Cal Thomas has exposed himself as the wolf in sheeps clothing and coward."
5,"Good Book, 4 and a half really.","This book is really exciting to read. Marianne Curley has written books that make me feel like I'm watching a movie sometimes because of the excitement she brings to her books. She brings intensity, suspense, excitement, drama, and romance in her books. A good read and highly recommended.(ps: I gave it 4 and a half cause the book didn't grasp me at the beggining like most of her books do, but that glitch is replaced soon by the rest of the book being excilerating)"
4,I really liked it!!,"I went back and forth between being really annoyed at the characters and liking them a lot. The most annoying thing for me was Jarrod and how (sometimes)incredibly insensitive he is. But all and all it was a good book. It has everything that you look for in a book romance, chemistry and mystery. It's probably the best book about magic I've read(with the exception of Harry Potter of course.)."
4,my review for old magic,This book is great!! I loved it. For a first novel I think it is excellent. It takes place in Australia and then it goes to 13th century Britan. I think it gives us a break from our world and lets us travel to a world of possibilities.
4,It was Good...,"I won't lie I did enjoy this read but I didn't find a whole lot of difference between Jarrod and Kate's first person narratives. I wish they would've varied a little more but the story was rich in teen romance, angst and high school reactions. I thoroughly enjoyed the time travel part as well. Over all I'd say it was an enjoyable read but for some reason I was expecting a little more."
4,Old Magic by Marianne Curley,Nice story for young teens. In the same category as some of the other popular Young Adult books. The story is interesting and the writer keeps you engaged throughout. Magic is the key word. No objectionable sexual content. Good gift for a middle schooler that you want to encourage to read for fun.
4,Old Magic book review,i deffinitly really liked this book it was well written and articulated and easy to follow and i thouroghly enjoyed it and as the first book that i ever read on a tablet device i'm glad i did cause it was a definite good read.
4,Exciting and adventurous!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It had alot of adventure and of course, magic. I think the best part of this book is when they travel back in time. This part was more exciting than the beginning.In this book Kate is a witch. She lives a pretty ordinary life teenage life. Except that she is ""the one"" who is always picked on for her strange behavior. Jarrod is the new kid at school. That is how Kate and Jarrod meet. Both of them become friends, but find out that there is a curse on Jarrod's family. Kate's grandmother then helps them to go back in time.Like I said, this is an exciting book. You defenitely have to be into fantasy to enjoy it."
5,couldn't put it down!,"This book was incredibly well written, especially for a first novel. This rates right up there with Tamora Pierce. The romantic twist was great and I loved the bathtub scene. This book was funny and adventures, but I would not recommend this for kids 10 or under, it did have a few part that would be semi inappropriate."
1,Whiny and Boring,"This was marketed as a young adult novel, not a midgrade novel. On the other hand, it seemed like the author tried for young adult and just failed. The magic was cheesy and lame and the medieval world they traveled to was as fake as a made for TV movie. Jarrod, one of the main characters, was whiny, annoying and constantly questioned what was going on around him. Who gets transported to another world and continues to simper and complain and rail against it? It was frustrating to say the least. It was a struggled to get through this one, but once I start a book I don't stop. Once again, I judged a book by its cover and got schooled. If you're looking for something better try books by Melissa Marr, Carrie Jones, Holly Black, C.M. Stunich, or Kelley Armstrong."
5,The Best Book I have Ever Read,"This book is definetly the BEST book I have ever read. I Could NOT stop reading it. One thing that I like about it is it has different point of veiws, so you see the different feelings and happenings in the different characters.I LOVE this book. It is not just for grades 7-9 or whatever it says, it is for readers of all ages! I think anyone who reads it would like it.This book grabs your attention then just keeps getting better and better. I loved the book after just the first chapter and then my friend said: ""But you arent even to the good part yet"" I didnt believe her at first, I loved the book already, but she was right, It just gets better and better!!!I would say you should DEFINTELY read this book!"
4,Pretty Good,"I read this book at the suggestion of one of my students. It took me about two chapters to really get into it, but once I was there, I was hooked. It's an interesting premise for a novel. From what I've seen it appeals to adolescent girls and anything that gets kids to read is wonderful in my opinion. It also has an appeal for adult readers. So it would be the perfect book for an parent and child to read together and discuss."
2,Not that great,"I first heard about this book while I was on Amazon. I then bought it because of the great reviews I read about the story, so I had very high expectations for the book.The story was not outstanding or different from other books I have read. It is also very evident that this is the author's first book.I think the reason why I didn't like this book was because the plot was so simple and everything just happened to fit. For example, Jarrod just so happens to be the seventh or whatever numbered child just when Kate asked. Also, Jarrod's character irked me to no end. He is such a dependent and passive character until the very end when he finally shows some courage. There were some parts in the book where I just wished Kate would leave Jarrod so that he'll finally believe after he keeps blowing things up.This book was very boring and not worth a read unless you have nothing better to do."
3,It was just average for me,"This book was ok. I got it b/c of the reviews on Amazon, but it was just alright for me."
4,Present Day Teens Go Medieval Time Travelling,"Kate, a teenage girl with powers. Jarrod, a teenage boy with more powers. At first he doesn't know about them, then he won't accept them. The book alternates back-and-forth between Kate and Jarrod's points of view.A powerful curse has been put on Jarrod's family by one of his own ancestors hundreds of years in the past. Thus begins the time travel to try and undo the curse."
2,This is wrong!!,"I'm sorry but while this book is definitely not boring,I have to rate it lowly.Kate is a witch and even though she constantly tried to make us feel sorry for her because she was apparently a white witch and not a black one,this is a girl who performed rituals that involved the sacrifice of goats' blood.Oh,I'm sorry,she didn't actually KILL the goats did she?Not good enough.Such rituals are still tasteless and immoral."
5,Amazing book!!!,"I believe this book is amazing, if you want a good book to read, and fall in love with, than I recomend Old Magic. As you read this book you can quickly imagine in your head what is happening.As if you are watching a movie. The chemistry that the two charachters, Kate and Jarrod have you can totally feel. You can relate in a way as to what they feel about life, and about highschool. If you are really feeling down, or just feel like reading I so recomend this book, you will spend the whole day reading it non-stop untill you finish. So get this book!!!!"
2,Witchy,This book was alright. I didn't love it or hate it. Overall kinda dull...Kate was the least magical 'magic' person I've ever read about. And this take on time traveling wasn't very interesting or exciting. Eh.
3,"Good, but came broken...","I bought this makeup kit for horse shows so I don't have to swap around makeup back and forth. Coming with mascara, blush, powder, eyeliner, lipgloss, and eyeshadow, it fit my needs very well. The makeup is good quality, and the eyeshadows are good colors.But, when it arrived, the top cover of it was unattached, and I have to use tape to keep it in place.Overall, this is a very good product, and if your looking for an all-in-one travel makeup case, it should fit your needs perfectly."
5,Useful,"My grandson plays lacrosse, thus the reason I bought this for his dad who always had questions about the rules.My son seemed insulted that I gave it to him (I guess because of the title), but my grandson is always reading it."
4,Great Box Lacrosse book,"This book is a great overview of the sport of box lacrosse. It does mention differences between box and field lacrosse and briefly discusses women's lacrosse as well. It's discussion on the equipment, positions, skills, and tactics of box lacrosse is it's strong point though. The Dummies title is misleading as there is plenty of information contained inside. Overall if your interested in learning more about box lacrosse it'd be hard to go wrong with this book."
1,Misleading title,"The title is misleading. It is not about the game of lacrosse as we know it in the United States.I assumed that I could trust the ""Dummies"" books to be a good general resource. However, this is not published in the U.S.It is mostly about the game of ""box lacrosse"" played indoors in Canada. The section on coaching your players how to cross-check pretty much says it all about how useful it is to the U.S. youth coach or player!"
2,"Great, if you're Canadian","Jim Hinkson's books are generally good. However, they are for box lacrosse - the indoor version of the game. Box lacrosse is not that popular in the US where field lacrosse is the dominant form of the game. If you're looking for something on field lacrosse look at Lacrosse: Fundamentals for Winning (Sports Illustrated Winner's Circle Books) or Lacrosse Technique and Tradition."
3,Boys Only Need Apply,"If you're coaching boys lacrosse, this is the book for you. However, if you're interested in girls or women's lacrosse, don't waste your money here. There's only a few pages on girls rules and even those are skimpy and practically useless."
4,Helpful,"I'm a senior athlete who now plays baseball and once played football, soccer, and basketball, as well as some other occasional sports such as tennis and golf. This book was helpful to me when my daughter took up lacrosse in high school. I wanted to understand what was going on when she practiced and in games. It's still foreign, but I understand the basics of the game and the tactics now."
3,For indoor lacrosse only!,"This book is NOT for US field lacrosse, boys or girls. Indoor Canadian...i suspect it is great, but I have no clue."
5,Another strong woman...,"Kate Chopin was an incredible woman who wrote from her heart. Regardless of the pain that she dealt with through her life, she still managed to create beautiful novels. As a rebel of her time, Chopin wrote about issues that shouldn't have been brought to the table. In fact, her novel, The Awakening, was banned in schools in the U.S. for quite some time. I'm obviously already a fan of Chopin, so reading this book was incredibly interesting. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to read about someone who had passion for life and writing. I also recommend any of her books (a good starter would be The Awakening), I guarantee that you won't be disappointed! And if you are disappointed, then maybe you need to rethink what you are looking for..."
4,CAUTION/cuidado!,"This is a typically beautiful, well-written Eve Bunting offering. She is a wonderful writer who has left a immeasurable body of work for the edification of all readers. Unfortunately, this book reinforces several negative stereotypes surrounding recent immigrants. Please preread this book and be prepared to discuss how how common/uncommon the situations the characters confront and the decisions they make in the face of them are, and don't let young readers get the idea that this is a book about unthinking or criminal ""Mexicans."""
2,How about a postive view of Hispanic families? This isn't it.,This book focuses on how a Hispanic family need to work for a white man and that speaking Spainish is not really valuble. Please choose another book when looking for a multicultural book for your class or child.
3,One knife came with scratched handle surface.,"I had to replace a box because of one knife came with scratched handle surface. Don't use forks on very hot meal, wait few minutes even if you are starving. Ends of fork became black and I don't know if it is possible to clean."
2,peeling and turns colors,the silver coating started to peel off a couple of the spoons and the flatware turns a dark brown color when u use it on hot foods only had this set for a month sending it back and going to look for something better
3,tear jerker,I love this old movie and I am happy to see it on DVD. It will touch your heart and you may shed some tears.
5,all mine to give,"All Mine to GiveI first sought this movie when I was about 14 years old. Today I'm 55 and still have it in my head as the best movie ever. My older brother and I cried every time during the five times we sought this movie on TV back home in Brazil. I looked for it under it's name in portuguese "" em cada corao uma saudade^ which has nothing to do with the original title, but it gave me the name in english ( thanks to the internet ). I want to see it again, in english this time, to see how much I cry. I will get my 15 year old daughter and her friends to watch this with me to see their reaction compared to mine some forty years ago. I highly recommend this. If it stayed in my mind for forty years, it must be great."
5,Great old film.,I have loved this film ever since I saw it back in the 50's. I had to have it for my collection and am very happy with the quality and substance of this movie.
3,Mom's All time Favorite,"I alway's remember my mom talking about this movie, also known as ""The day they gave babie away"" She was the oldest of 6 and lost her dad at a young age and talked about watching this movie with her siblings and how much she loved it, among all the things I've gotten her for Christmas, I think this year this one gift will be one of the Best!TJM"
2,Depressing!,"Wonderous adventure???? Are you kidding!!!! This was the saddest, most depressing movie I have ever seen. My heart broke watching that little boy trudging up the hill alone after giving away his younger siblings. I didn't know how to rate it. It wasn't a bad movie, it was just very depressing."
2,A basket of briquettes?,"The pianist, Frederik Ullen, performs masterfully Ligeti's idiosyncratic freespirited experimental compositions. Some evoke mental impressions like ""raindrops on tin roofs,"" ""rats attack the xylophone,"" ""peas and pebbles in a pot"" and ""melancholia by the Danube."" These CDs are for devoted Ligeti aficionados. There are reasons why this piano music is very seldom heard by a paying audience."
3,KATELAND,"This movie is purely for entertainment, anything you might see, or hear, should not be taken too seriously. Prince Charles, knew both Diana, and Mrs Parker Bowles, for a very long time. But Mrs Parker Bowles got tired of waiting around for him, as nothing much seemed to be happening with her and charles. He was also in the navy, so was away alot. And she went off and married another man. And it was Diana who became his wife. This movie is all about Prince Charles and his mistress, Mrs Parker Bowls, and Diana and her lover, Captain James Hewitt. He was a very plain looking fellow, but for some reason they put in a good looking actor to play his part. There was too much kissing, and cuddleing between these four people in this movie. It became very tiresome after awhile. I kept waiting for the film to get a move on, and to see a good exciteing story come of it. But that didnt happen. There are much better movies about Charles and Diana out there. Than this version."
5,Methods for devil-foiling,"Girolamo Menghi was the most highly-acclaimed exorcist during the Italian Renaissance. Gaetano Paxia presents a detailed, acute, well-balanced introduction to demonology, as a preface to the full text of Menghi's 16th-century exorcisms, which were widely adopted by men of the Church both inside and outside Italy. This version is based on a volume published in 1576; Paxia and Janet Sethre have translated the Menghi texts into English. Anyone interested in the ""idea"" of the Devil, as it has varied among cultures and evolved down through the centuries, will find this book to be an indispensable milestone."
2,Good Looking Shoe w/o Durability,I love the appearance but the shoe is already tearing up in two places. One place on each shoe. I have had the shoe about six weeks. They were early Christmas present. I need to contact the seller about an exchange or something. But it did take me about four weeks to break them in so I guess i will take them to a shoe repair place and see what they say.Thank you
3,"Hawkwind - 'Anthology,1967-1982' (Essential)","Two CD's, a total of thirty-two tracks that have been lifted from various Hawkwind compilations, like 'Acid Daze,Volumes 2 and 3', 'Text Of Festival', 'Space Ritual 2' and the WAY-over reissued (again and again and AGAIN) 'Bring Me The Head Of Yuri Gagarin'(see my review of each of the titles). SURE,there are decent cuts here like ""Hash Cake '77"", the Watchfield Festival snippet of ""We Do It / Brainstorm"" and ""Urban Guerrilla"", but this budget-priced title is obviously aimed toward the completists."
2,Las Mexican Juanas,"Esta produccion es una copia de las Juanas una novela Colombiana de mucho exito. la Junas originales fue creada alla por 1997, desafortunadamente esta copia Mexicana creada en 2004, no esta a la altura de la novela original la cual era la que estaba buscando."
1,please be more specific,"If it wasnt for a comment I might have ordered this item,until I read that it was the Mexican version,not the original.There is no comparison btw Mexican and Colombian ""telenovelas"".I hate Mexican versions,they always mess them up,and to add salt to the injury I have to listen to their""Spanish"",which SUX."
3,Good lovable show but crappy DVD quality,"I love this show to bits, i never get tired of watching it over and over again. The story might not be as good as the original from colombia however it still brings a smile to my face.the downside however is not the telenovela itself but that the DVDs come damaged. I got two DVD3 in one of the sets together with damaged DVD 5. Amazon was helpful and got a replacement however after watching them on my DVD player, it started to stop working. Something with a kind of gunk stuck to the laser... coming from the DVDs apparently dunno. It is sad that such a good show is recorded in such low quality DVD as well as a badly designed case that causes the dvds to scratch each other. Not amazon's fault though, but Laguna film'sIf you want to get the show it is totally fine since it keeps u entertained just keep in mind your DVD player life is gonna go down."
2,Damaged,The DVD where all scracht and with some stuff on it it was a mess really.I asked for a replacement and it was the same. I asked for my refund.
2,WHAT A JOKE,"My 5 yo wanted Barbie & the Magic of Pegasus sooooo bad! She got it, so her Aunt & Uncle purchased this to go with it. Perhaps she is just too young, but in 4 months the only thing it's been good for is collecting dog hair.NOT WORTH THE [...]"
2,Falls apart!,"In concept, this is a great toy. In design, however, it has many flaws. The backdrop piece just does not stay attached! (I actually fun-tacked it to the wall behind where Cloud Kingdom sits in my daughter's playroom.) The Clouds pieces, while very pretty, are just not solid enough to hold up. And be sure to make plenty of space for this toy because it takes up 3 feet of room and does not fold away for storage. My 4-year-old does not seem to mind any of this, though. It really does inspire her imaginative play as she flies her pegasi through the sky!"
2,Cute but pitiful design.,"Assembled, this toy is very pretty. Especially when all of the dolls (sold separately) are posed on it. It's VERY cute! However,the design/quality is very poor. Mattel needs to keep in mind that parents sometimes need to relocate or store a toy, and this playset cannot be moved without falling completely apart. It falls apart when it's played with too. Also, the backdrop is made out of cardboard. CARDBOARD! It doesn't attach firmly and keeps falling off. I don't think Mattel bothers to test market their toys with actual children anymore. If they did, they would know this needed more work before release. I guess it's cheaper to rush a toy to market before Christmas than to perfect and produce a quality product. If I had been able to examine one of these playsets before purchasing, I wouldn't have purchased it."
1,cheaply made,"this toy came with cracked plastic pieces, the ""cardboard"" backround doesn't stay on. the attachments for that also broke before my daughter even got to see it for christmas morning.overall i think its very cheaply made, but the accesories and dolls are fine."
2,Don't waste your money,"My daughter really wanted the Cloud Kingdom for Christmas. As soon as I saw the quality of it, I should have returned it but I knew it would break her heart. It takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most Barbie houses. My daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together, so she hardly plays with it. This toy is definately not worth the money. I wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy."
1,Very disappointed,My 5 year old daughter loves Barbie and all the Pegasus toys but Could Kingdom provides no stimulation for her and she is disappointed and bored with it. It hasnt captured her attention for more than 5 minutes and she loves to use her imagination. It takes so long to put it together and is not durable. It is expensive for what is provided and there should be more magical lights and buttons to press to make it interesting but its basic a bunch of plastic clouds that take up a lot of space.
3,Getting better again,"Scarrows story about our two centurions is getting better again. The language in this book is a great deal better than in the previous books. Maybe a bit more literature this time? This story is a little bit thin when it comes to the escape scene, and is a bit predictable in the whole. That's why I won't give it more than 3 stars, but I will continue to read more about Cato and Macro."
4,Talk about the Tension!,"Another good adventure from Simon. Our two friends, Cato and Macro are both centurions under the command of a bad piece of work, Maximus who botches up an important piece of work which manages to lead to the selection, by lots, of those troops to be decimated. Poor Cato is one of the ones chosen... Ooo-er! But have no fear! All will be well because we know there are more books in the series. The build-up of tension is very good and the knife-edge battles are bloody. Good stuff!"
2,A let down,This book appears to be about a modern army set in classic Roman times. The characters did not appear to be real. I could not recommend this book to anyone who has read any Roman history or fiction of the times.Rocky
5,The Eagle's Prey,"I have enjoyed all of the ""Eagles"" novels that I have read so far. Simon Scarrow has the ability to bring to life the characters in his books. He makes history come to life and one feels as though one is in the midst of what is going on with the Roman legions. I hope that he continues to write books concerning this time period because he makes it so exciting and interesting."
2,"Fair, yet censored","My wife and I have been Holocaust readers for several years now, and have many documentaries within our library.This is a good documentary about the holocaust and the escape from Auschwitz, but the europe DVD copy is more thorough in its descriptionof the camp itself.This American copy is CENSORED for the ""safety of our children"" and ourpolitically sensitive viewers.FYI Only.Respectfully, John EUpstate NY."
3,information on a severe tragedy,"This documentary was about 2 men who escaped from Auschwitz and lived to inform others about the genocide going on there. The reenactment scenes are filmed in black-and-white and I wonder if that were meant to copy ""Schindler's List.""I thought this might be like the film ""Escape from Alcatraz"" where the focus is on the escape. However, the escape is covered for 5 minutes or less. This concerns the conditions in the camp and the aftermath of the escape more than the aforementioned items.It is ver difficult for me to watch anything having to do with Nazis or concentration camps. I can deal with Titanic, but relatively modern tragedies are more difficult for me to handle. So if you are squeamish about WWII and wish it never happened at all, you may be wary of seeing this. If you are like me and have trouble processing things that are incredibly painful, you may not want to see this work."
3,A let down,"With all due respect to the great atistry of Celia Cruz. This is just a poor recording. Poorly arranged and mastered. Terrible, noisy, tinny sound. Just an old compilation of old recordings that doesn't do justice to Celia's more recent work after she was ""discovered"" in the U.S."
4,good information beyond the ordinary,"this goes beyond the very one sided information the others have been cashing in on. actually talks about the dangers of synthetics including parabens and arms you with information without promoting one form of skin care over another.objective.beware those ""informing"" when they have an agenda such as their own line of product to sell.these folks do not."
2,"Then again, maybe not...","I thought I would like this book, as I am very interested in the topic. But it was not practically useful at all. The information was overwhelming. I am not going to write down 55 different ingredients, each one 32 letters and numbers long, on a list to take every time I go shopping. You're better off just trying to buy natural products in general, than to try to get anything useful out of this book."
1,Didn't get the right product,"I ordered this bike light, and received a helmet light instead. Stupid me, I didn't open the package until right before Christmas so I could gift-wrap it. I gave the helmet-lamp to my son anyway, who never uses it. I should have checked the package earlier, and sent it back-postage due- to get the right gift."
1,Depressing Sounding Christmas Carols,"While the performers have nice voices, the music is far from merry sounding, nor is it soothing. It's down right depressing."
3,Not a CD player,"I purchased the DVC603 for two reasons, to be used as a DVD player and to replace/consolidate my Sony five disc CD player. After using it now for five months I'm now not so happy with my decision. Although it does a great job playing DVD's (as almost all DVD players now do) it does a poor job functioning as a CD player. If a CD has the slightest scratch it will skip and about 30% of the time when I put a CD into the player it has trouble reading it and opens back up again, very annoying. Finally, if your like me and you like to load five CD's, hit randon and let it go beware, it takes a long time to shuffle between CD's. Unfortunatley I had to go back into the garage, unbox the old CD player and bring it back into the house. Now I'm stuck with a five disk DVD player."
5,A great unit for the price,"I bought one of these about 2 months ago. So far it works perfect. It will play anything, SVCD,VCD,DVD,CDR,CDRW, with no problems. It is quiet. The remote is a tad small and hard to read in the dark. Picture and sound quality is excellent."
4,"Funny, yet teaches ""fair play"".","Sabrina The Teenage Witch has a famous cat named Salem. Salem now has his own series of books! This is the first!Tobias is the cat who stars in the Pretty Kitty Cat Food commercials. Salem believes HE could do a better acting job, for a high paycheck. So he and Sabrina are off to the studio.The money may be good, but the New and Improved cat food Salem must advertise is not.***Salem is funny. Sabrina keeps Salem honest, but his is still one greedy cat. He can be generous too! He promised half his pay to the animal shelter. This one will entertain kids, as well as, teach them the meaning of ""fair play"". I hightly recommend this one!***"
3,Salem,"Okay to start with Salem the cat gets a chance of a life time to act in a commercial, He really wants to win because he wants to ride in the Limio. Big but he has to compete with another cat easy think again the cat food tastes awful but the oponent cat does not like the food either so he eats a differnt food in the new cat bag what does Salem do now!"
2,Low Quality Audio,"I purchased this t.v. for the kids room. I didn't want to pay a lot of money, but wanted a good, basic set. The picture quality is fine, but the sound is far from crisp. It's like listening to the audio played into a soup can, real muffled/scratchy sounding. I tried adjusting the audio levels (treble, bass, and such) and the annoying soup can factor is still there. I'll be taking this t.v. back to the store."
1,DOA,"That's for dead on arrival, boys and girls. Here's the drill:1. Unpack2. Plug in3. NOTHING HAPPENS4. Pack5. ReturnGood luck!P.S. Other than the fact that it didn't work, it was a pretty good deal ;)"
4,Momo doesn't like kissing!!,"Momo is a cute little monkey who lives in a Babar-like jungle created by Emma Chichester Clark, the author/illustrator of the Blue Kangaroo books. In general he is a very happy little monkey ,,,, until the kissing starts! Kissing everywhere, all the time, for this and that, hello and goodbye, morning and night. Momo tells everyone he knows, ""No more kissing!"" But it doesn't do any good. He cannot understand why everybody likes it so much .... until his little brother smiles at him.This is a sweet book for little ones who don't like kissing, or new big brothers and sisters, or even babysitters."
5,No sophomore slump,"Downhere's second CD fixes all of the problems with their first release. While Downhere's debut was flat and repetitive, So Much For Substitutes comes alive. The songs are catchy and rockin' and the tracks offer a nice variety as you flow through the collection. They've become more musically adventurous and aggressive. Overall production is better too, bringing a more contemporary sound (at times it suggests almost a more commercial version of Kevin Max.)An absolute must for any CCM fan who wants genuine, non-cookie-cutter rock that not only makes you think, it makes you hum."
5,Great Work,"This is an awesome sophomore cd by Downhere. It shows true skill and the lyrics are very down to earth and relate to me and other believers so well. A favorite of mine is ""Comatose"". Good song with thought provoking lyrics like ""Are you comfortable being so comfortable?"". This cd is more of a rock n roll cd compared to their awesome cd ""Downhere"". This one adds more guitar to the music and is truly awesome. The music is just basically telling the church to reach outside of their ""walls"" and reach others with God's love. It's a call to all. Great music and very addicting! After listening to the first view seconds of the first song on the cd ""What It's Like"" you will be hooked on it. Great workmanship! And who doesn't like four God fearing Canadians?!? Oh, Canada..."
3,A little disapointed,"I loved Downhere's frist CD, so I purchased this one. I was slightly disapointed. The songs are much more repetative and quite a bit rockier. I liked the old stuff better. However, the quality is still good and I haven't decided not to listen to it yet, so It's not that bad."
4,Its About Numbers ...,"The numbers and lot of them. BA is the king of minor league baseball and is this is a collection of all the minor league stats. No special things, just a collection of numbers."
3,"Works, but not great.","All 4 channels work good, and it was easy to add an additional drive. The problem that I have been having is that the time freezes and the only way to unfreeze it is to do a hard reset of the system. After the reset, all of the programing is erased and needs to be reentered. It does this once about every 2 months."
1,Lorex Service veryyyyyyyyyyy bad,"Do not buy the Lorex product cause their service is very very bad. I order the item on Saturday, they ship my item after 7 days. When the product is defective, I call them to ask a question, they do not care about my concern, they transfer me around, I sit on the phone around 45 minutes for not thing and very upset. You can read more review about Lorex service on Costco website and Google website to get an idea. Thank you for read my review, I am really disappoint about their service."
1,Tech support sucks,"You need to ask one question to yourself b4 buying any security system. What if i have problems when connecting online with my system after 12months & 1 day because believe me it will happen.Lorex will rape you for phone support.Solution 1) run from Lorex no matter how much the savings 2) buy a system that has lifetime support (samsung) & no i don;t work for them just an idiot who bought a Lorex system.I'm a do it yourselfer but viewing you camera shots when overseas or away from home is technical, they know it & they charge you for it.Don;t buy lorex is my conclusion in this review."
3,USB audio is the devil.,"After a couple of years of wonderful sound under OS 9, I upgraded my Mac to OS X (10.3.2). The ""crash-proof"" operating system was not USB Audio-proof: when my SoundSticks are connected and playing, my computer would more or less randomly but frequently render my USB mouse and keyboard useless, essentially freezing the computer. USB audio simply introduces another level of things to possibly go wrong. The sound is great, though, so if you're considering these get the newer SoundSticks II instead: they use the 3.5 mm audio out jack and are otherwise the same."
1,Compatibility Problems,Did you upgrade your Mac with a PCI-USB card? You did? Then forget Soundsticks. They won't work. The Apple System Profiler recognizes them but the Sound Control Panel doesn't.Sure wish Soundstick's technical data mentioned this.Harman/Kardon's Tech support was no help at all.Pity... and they look so cool.
5,THEY HAVE OTHER USES,"Forget the computer, I plug my Ipod Nano into these and they work fantastic.My best Christmas present by far."
5,as clear as a bell,"The sound out of these speakers is as clear as their appearance, especially at high volume. I would love to be able to get a set for my home theater. They are also a great conversation piece! There is no analog connection, USB only."
5,Best looking speakers also provide excellent sound.,"I have had these speakers for 4 years and there have been no regrets. Great sound, even better looks - you will want to keep the subwoofer on the desk."
1,Sub Woofer Problems,"After only a couple of months of light use, the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working. As soon as power is connected to the sub woofer, the loud thumping starts. I exchanged the system and the second set had the same problem after 6 weeks!! A total piece of junk."
2,"Great form, poor function","Poor midrange, poor lows and hard to reach volume control for the sub. At this price point there are far better choices. Klipsch Promedia 2.1, Logitech Z560, Monsoon MM-1000, Altec Lansing 641's to name a few. If you're shopping speakers, do yourself a favor and listen to brands I list above first. The soundsticks are ridiculously outclassed at this price point and catagory. The only thing that they have going for them is looks. Definitely not recommended."
3,aint the best,KLIPSCH RULEZ!!their 2.1 system is far superior to any other 2.1 speaker system on the planet for under $X! much more powerful & the clearest there is!
1,Look much better than they sound...,"Found these to be very disappointing and ended up returning them. Not only is the sound poor, but I found that when using them with a new LCD iMac running OS X, you can't control the volume from the keyboard volume controls, or from the menu bar - the volume can only be controlled from the sound preference panel. Bought a set of Monsoon 702's instead which sound much better and cost way less."
2,Nothing to see here.,The take along sea cars feature a lobster and an octopus poorly executed in clear plastic boxes. Certainly far from the best examples of the take along Thomas series.
5,Honda CBR Rectifier,"GREAT DEAL!I shopped around for this part for days. From the parts house to all kinds of dealers only to find it was the same part for the Honda CBR models with extreme fluctuation in prices. Needless to say this was frustrating! Fount this one for my 900RR and was not only was I happy with it's speedy delivery, well protected packaging, but the part was OEM and fired my bike right up. After testing to make sure the new rectifier was giving me the proper voltage...It was time to ride! Great price, great product, efficient shipping and handling. Two thumbs up! Thanks for saving the day guys ;)"
4,A modern 'Thousand and One Nights' tale,"The pasha of Beyazit, Mahmut Khan, puts a member of a mountain tribe, Ahmet, in prison because of a conflict about a horse.One af the daughters of the pasha, Gülbahar, falls in love with Ahmet.When the pasha annouces the beheading of Ahmet, all the tribes under his control rise in revolt. They feel that they are invincible and can bring the tyrant down if they stay united (love each other).But is love (symbolized by the steamy affair between Ahmet and Gülbahar) stronger than dissent?You can find the answer to this question in this oriental, but modern, symbolic legend with an infidel blacksmith, a white bird flying in the evening, a roaring mountain ...Although the actions and emotions are sometimes a little bit overcharged (with ah's and oh's), this colourful and twisted parable should highly appeal to all adult readers.Not to be missed."
3,A mostly-enjoyable read but problematic,"Okay, first let's get the same complaint you've already read several times before out of the way: Heavy metal music does not begin and end with Metallica, yet this book sure makes it look like it does. Now for the other big complaint I have: It completely dismisses entire genres of metal. European power metal is mentioned in a grand total of one sentence, and that sentence basically snidely says ""it's confined to Europe."" Progressive metal gets a single mention, and that's no more than an off-the-cuff reference to Dream Theater. There are others, of course, but those are the first two that jump to mind as glaring omissions. Also, heavily inaccurate generalizations pop up now and again...my personal favorite WTF moment was when Christe lumped Fates Warning into the same category as Manowar. But all that aside, it's a fun, mostly well-written read with plenty of nice little anecdotes from the general history of heavy metal."
5,Metal Memories Like Thunderclaps,"There is not a bad thing I can say about this book. I found it insightful and most historic. It took me back to many of the bands that I grew up listening to and renewed my appreciation of heavy music as I watched it form.Being in my mid thirites I grew along with this stuff and also played a lot of it in my band. So it was interesting reliving some of the legendry and also some of the fictions we always heard. It is broken up over the years and focuses on the music of that time and how it all broke off from metal in one way or another. The part that was most alarming was the section of Scandinavian Death Metal. Whoa was that harsh stuff.I recommend this book to fans of the genre in particular, and pretty much fans of rock music, since so many of the acts listed arrived at their stylings based on the classics of the 60's and 70's. A great read straight through from page one to page 400."
5,The Ultimate Guide to Downloading Metal,"All I knew about heavy metal beforehand was that I wanted to know more. Sound of the Beast filled in the blanks, and surprised me a lot. It's a little overwhelming, but what did I expect? Overall, I was left feeling a lot more respect for metal -- this is really the book that metalheads deserve. They were the rejected, and they built their own universe. Powerful stuff, and plenty funny and scary at times. It's an instant classic, and the lists are very useful, too."
3,Questionable but still a good read,"I really enjoyed reading this book, but it had some big flaws: a lot of the facts are questionable and even more are the quotes that the author uses. I find it very odd that she can dig though thousands of magazines over a span of 20 years, and find a quote from a specific person, dealing with a irrelivant and specific topic. the author does focus a lot of more US acts than is fair, givin the fact that a lot, if not most of the metal genre breakthroughs came from europe. its still a good read though and it never gets dull or drags on. Ignore the ""must have lists"" too..."
4,Great book,"Finally I had a brand new book. I was delighted ripping the plastic off from it. It is a great work, with good reviews and supported facts of the history of metal. The pictures in it are surprising, the kind you never knew that existed. The only thing I wonder is why the quality of the paper is that poor because when consider the kind of matter the book is about they should have made it out of better quality paper. Apart from it the book is worthy buying and reading. Real metal lovers will not regret of having it. Two thumbs up. Cheers."
4,Great History of Metal,"I really enjoyed this book. Christie provides a very concise and comprehensive overview of heavy metal, covering all time periods and sub-genre's of HM music."
1,"Borrow it, don't buy it","Other reviewers have listed the flaws (basically an Ode to Metallica, ignores important bands, dismisses punk entirely, etc) but I also have a juvenile negative reaction to anyone listing ""living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn"" in their bio. That one sentence speaks volumes about what is inside. No judgement, I live in Williamsburg, too, but...The book is interesting, but not worth the cover price."
5,THE BEST!,"MY GOOOOD this is by far the best Heavy Metal history book ever, it's been written with such passion for the music that makes you want to buy every album by bands you've haven't heard yet. The explanation of why neither Zeppelin or Deep Purple are the fathers of heave metal it's great, and gives Black Sabbath full credit for creating this amazing type of music. Any metal fan should read this book."
3,Metal History Lesson,"It was ok. If you are looking for a book about hair metal it is only a small part of this book. It gets into harder stuff like death metal, speed metal, etc. It reads like a history book and does not really contain stories, but more facts. It is very thorough though and if you are looking for a perspective on all types of metal, you can't go wrong."
3,Metal!!!!!!!,"I love heavy metal. It's agressive and artisitic, angry and beautiful. I was attracted to this book by the cover, which resembles several of the best metal albums of the 80's and 90's. This book takes a look at the birth of heavy metal - from Zeplin and Sabbath, to the death metal bands that pushed the genre to the extreme. It tries to stay in a chronological order, but it does get a little off at times. And, there is a little too much on Metallica. I did learn some interesting facts and even discovered some new bands along the way. So three devil horns up. Okay, that was corny...Help me find a good book! - michaelslibrary.blogspot - dotcom!"
2,Dishonest book- DO NOT BUY IT.,"What would you think of a rock ""scholar"" who says that Queensryche's Operation:mindcrime is a science-fiction opera? This person is way too lost and greatly uninformed. Cut to the chase. More than a history of heavy metal, what this dishonest book really offers is an open love declaration for Metallica. Each and every idea or happening in the book has to be related to that band. Remove all the Metallica related information and you will get maybe 3 pages about other bands. The book is light and shallow because the information is nothing but common knowledge for any metal fan. Summarizing: this a Metallica worship biography publication disguised as ""the history of heavy metal."""
3,Interesting bit of Irish theatre history,"The Irish Dramatic Texts are scrupulously researched editions of important plays in the Irish dramatic repertoire. They've already given us a good scholarly edition of Brendan Behan's An Giall, the original Irish-language version of The Hostage; now they've brought out Denis Johnston's first play, a wild, weird and witty Expressionist ramble through thirties Dublin. It's his most experimental work, and perhaps his most successful, although it's too mired in local and contemporary allusions to be very performable today. Still, students of the man's work will find this a useful resource."
2,Started out well...,"I purchased this microsytem in April, and within months my stereo was malfunctioning. The radio and cassette deck work fine, it is the CD player which is giving me problems. On nearly every CD I play, halfway through the disc a scratching sound is heard. Despite having tried every possible cleaning method, it still does not work properly. I was very disappointed with this, as i love the style and the sound is great aside from that. I would suggest taking an extended warranty."
3,fondue pot,"I've only used this product once and it did not keep the melted chocolatewarm, the chocolate started to clump."
5,3-D elephant mold is GREAT!,"This elephant mold can be used to make a standing 3-D elephant or 2 1/2 elephants to be used facing each other on top of a cake. They were a big hit with my friends. Many people thought they were so perfect that they were wooden sculptures, not candy!"
3,Nice product until it has a problem,"I have this system it is only a Yr and a half old about a week after the warrenty went up it went up.It started to spit cd's out not play dvd's and sometimes not give us back the disk that we put in.Pioneer was nice enough to extend the warrenty.Well 4 months after having it fixed it started doing the same thing again,I called pioneer 2 times and each time they refused to do anything,Finally after speaking with a super visor and exlaning that for a product that is not even 2 yrs old and having to be fixed 2 times in 4 months this is not a good thing.She agreed with me and since the product is doing the same thing again they are fixing it again at their cost.I wanted to post this review so that you can make the right choice on your electronic purchase this was quite expensive when i bought it and feel that it should not need to be repaired 2 times in 4 months,so be careful."
3,Good product with problems,I bought this product 2 1/2 yrs back. From last 3 months it has started to spitt out CD's and DVD.
1,Yawn,"Arch Gold -- is that supposed to be like Golden Arches, as in a famous franchise, because someone obviously wants this to become a franchise, I look at all the five stars begging for a series, one review's written by someone with the same last name as the author, and I think --to become a franchise, you can't have a hero with the personality of a piece of iceberg lettuce, you can't have a book that never finds its own voice, that never provides you a laugh or a tear or gives you goosebumps (if I want to learn about the legal system I'd rather read a textbook, probably have as much suspense) --but to be a fiction franchise, you've got to meet the Gold Standard, like Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe, you've got to have a main character readers really care about and identify with, which I'm sorry to say I didn't, and as for all these ""twists and turns and surprises"", I say, get over yourself."
1,burden it ain't,"hold it -- did they expect us to think this was scott turow's ""burden of proof""?! no way is it half as good!!!!first chapters not bad, but then it's soooo by the numbers. male characters are better than the women at least, who are totally 1-dimensional, a mistress, a stripper, talk about cliches. character development way too weak, arch hasn't grown enough in interesting ways for me by the end ot the book, and i can't find a theme anywhere. all the dialogque sounds like i've heard it somewhere before.final verdict -- ""offer of proof"" is a turow wannabe that lacks imagination emotion & suspense."
5,this guy has written a superior crime novel,"Well, all I can say is three cheers for Mr. Heilbrun for writing a superior crime novel. Why superior? Because the guy obviously knows what he's writing about and knows how to describe it so that it is simultaneously entertaining, deeply informative, and with a real credo behind it. Heilbrun has a great ear. Each character has his/her own distinct and unique voice, many of them quirky and funny, others even quite moving. And the ending will surprise you! Here's hoping Heilbrun's next book with Arch Gold is on its way soon. This has to be a series. Readers will demand it."
4,Offer Of Proof -- A Lead-off Home Run,"New author Heilbrun touches all the bases with his first offering. Riveting portrayal of New York's criminal justice system with enough plot twists to keep you guessing until the very end. Can't wait to follow the courtroom adventures of Arch Gold in the sequel. If Heilbrun can mentate filmically, Offer of Proof will be an exciting movie soon."
2,I really wanted to like it,"I picked up this book at the bookstore while still in hardcover and after reading the description thought it sounded good. So, I waited for the softcover. Good thing I did.Although I like the basic premise of the Public Defender trying to figure out a murder in which he is suppose to be representing the killer, I just could not get into it.I think the problem with this one is the writing style. Although the author writes in non-legalese, there is so much said for nothing. It feels as though the author just keeps writing and writing and never actually gets anywhere with his theme.The action is fair, but I was so bored by the time it appeared that I just could not get into it.I really, really wanted to like this book, but it just did not happen."
5,Great Value!,"This is a very resonably priced, functional, carry-on bag. It rolls well and the cosmetic bag keeps things organized and easily removes to hang up anywhere once you get to your hotel. The shoulder strap is useful to hang the bag over your large, checked bag's handle until you turn it over to the airline. It is easy to stow in the overhead or under the seat."
3,Solar Light Set,"These lights are good looking and provide excellent light. However, three of the lights are defective. Customer service was good about replacing the defective lights."
1,They hardly ever work,"I'm shocked that this item got such good reviews. The lights are very attractive. The problem is, they rarely work. The first night they all looked great. I've had them for about 2 weeks now and it's been straight downhill since that first night. It's potluck . . . sometimes one or two will light, sometimes NONE will light. On rare occasions 3 or 4 will light. I don't recommend these. It's not worth the shipping fees to send them back so I'm just stuck with a bunch of lemons."
2,Half the lights do not work!,"I am still struggling with this product to get about half the 15 lights to work! Sometimes they come on at the end of the day, and sometimes not. But I have never had more than 7 work at the same time. After carefully following the simple instructions, I am certain it is an item defect. This product is definitely going back!"
3,Westinghouse 15-PC Cobalt Solar Light Set - Stainless Steel,"Good quality and great price, but they don't really work if the sun doesn't come to your house."
4,Excellent decorative lighting at low cost,These lights are well worth the price for as many lights as you get. Really looks good in the front of my house with my new landscaping.
5,"Great Product, nice solar lights for the value.",Great looking set of lights for the value. You can buy four from other vendors for a hunderd dollars. Best Value for the price.
1,Not a good buy if you want light,"I have purchased three sets of these lights. Many never worked, even with new ni-cad batteries which I purchased at additional cost. After six months only about 6 of the 36 still worked, feebly at best. Not a good buy."
1,"These lights don't work, relacing the batteries is not the issue!","We bought these lights in late 2008, since then we've replaced the batteries twice and more than half of them still don't work! Being that they are supposed to be solar powered, I don't think the batteries should need to be replaced more than 1x/5 yrs, I've seen other solar powered lights last MUCH longer than that. VERY disappointed in these lights, when you spend extra money, you expect extra quality- these lights did NOT deliver that."
2,Need only 12?,"2 of them did not work from the get go, then in less than a year the other one died by themselves...They look good but one would expect a little more lifetime time."
4,Path Lights,"Current rating(***--)I purchased these lights for my driveway and front door path.They worked great for about 2 months, now they are lightly lit for about 2 hours, well at least the ones that have enough power to turn on.They were easy to install in soft ground, took about 3 minutes per light. Stakes are not of great material, be gentle with them.I just purchased new rechargable batteris*SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesI will update if they work and for how long."
2,solar powered outdoor lights stainless westinghouse,I purchased two 15 light sets a few months ago and at first they all seemed to charge up and light up but now half of the lights light up. I've removed the batteries and cleaned the contacts and when I put the last battery back in some lights would light but very dim. The next evening; however the same troubled lights would not light. Can someone tell me why I spent so much money to put the nice looking but not reliable lights in place of my very expensive but reliable electrical lighting which I yanked out after installing these pitafull lights.
5,Conway Twitty 20 All Time Greatest Hits,This is one of the best cd's I have and even though it was on back order it still arrived before Christmas. Thanks
4,Interesting Video,Bought as a gift for my Texans to watch in the summer when it is too darn hot in encouragement to come visit the most beautiful place in the northeast. Great history too.
4,Adirondacks DVD,Received DVD in a timely manner. Documentary was both interesting and well done. Wanted DVD for research purposes and it fit the bill. It provided a nice overview of the area.
5,Muhammad Ali: The Greatest Collection DVD,"This is a must have for boxing fans, really.All three fights are supurb quality even for there shown dates, and unlike the Ali fight videos you normally buy, which might show you a recording of the fight as it was on TV. It shows almost every single bit of camera that was filmed at the time, joined together in order.It even showed the complete Ali-Liston fight which I already have a video off, and it has MUCH more footage.The extra DVD is also great taking you step by step through almost every single of Ali's professional fights.The commontry and sound in general is also awsome!Supurb-If you love Boxing like me you are a real fool not to buy this, really."
5,Ali - The Ultimate Boxer & Showman,"After watching this DVD I was reminded just how fantastic Ali really was. To see his pranks & showboating inside & outside the ring was amazing, especially when you consider what was at stake every time he stepped in the ring. His personality and currage is an inspiration to us all. The footage of the fights is very in depth, with all the build up and after fight interviews etc. Also the Documentery is well put together, a great tribute. If you have only the slightest interest in boxing this is still a must buy, and for the fans it's a gem. Boxing in a different class!"
2,The 3 Ali-Frazier fights.,"I'm very disappointed that after all these years, there is not a DVD put out w/ just the 3, Ali/Frazier fights. I'm sure that it would be a big seller for some DVD company. If anyone knows of such a release, please respond.Thank you,RSF..."
5,"Great content, but problems with DVD playing properly","This is a great DVD for any Ali fan. Rather than just seeing highlights, it is fun to see these fights in their entirety, and there is plenty of supplementary material. One problem though: this DVD does not play properly in my player (a Panasonic 110). Many of the chapters will not play at all. Does anyone know if or how I can get a copy that works correctly?"
4,rock and rap confidential tell us,"Pete Rock's dad was a DJ and his record collection provided the raw material for his son the sampler. The anthemic ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"" begins with a Tom Scott horn line mixed into the Association's ""Cherish,"" all over a drum loop nicked from James Brown. Rock sets the table for C.L. Smooth, whose voice allows him to deliver penetrating takes on love, race, and religion."
4,PASC12 good monitor for the $$$,"The Pyle Pro stage monitor PASC12 is a good piece of equipment forthe money. I found it a little weak on bass, but the all-importantvocal reproductions come thru well and this is what a monitor isall about. I like the fact that there is no carpet covering to pickup trash from the stage floor and the lack of carpet covering doesn'tseem to hurt the acoustics."
1,Cheap - Several Problems,"I bought two of these recently and figured that for such a low price as long as sound came out of them, they would be worth it. Regretfully, out of the box, one of them did not make any sound and had to be returned.The other remaining unit has some serious, basic issues. The 1/4"" jacks are wired so badly one jack was completely useless (because internally a wire crossed over in such a way to short anything plugged into it). The other 1/4"" jack was intermittent, mostly due to its inability to lock a cable into place inside it (because of cheap and flimsy connector parts).Lastly - the cheap material used to cover these speakers is damaged very easily, and after only a few shows has large scratches, holes and tears revealing the wood underneath. They spared no cost-cutting trick to manufacture these marvels of the low-fi industry.I do not recommend these speakers - you would be better off taping your dollars together into a megaphone shape and shouting through them."
1,Cheap,"Guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for. I didn't expect these speakers to be great but I did expect them to function. Wrong. Don't waste your money. Power handling claims are a flat out lie."
3,BASIC EQUIPMENT...,"It is recommended for those who wants to buy maybe their first pair of monitors...The bad:a) The side holders are made of plastic and they are very weak,b) The sound is muddy... it is weak on highs,c) The corners' protector are made of plastic so probably they won't be hard enough...The good:a) C'mon! These speakers are pretty cheap,b) They SEEM to be like a ""PRO Monitor"",c) I plugged into a 1200 watts amp. and they worked mmm let's say good on stage... (that's their mission isn't it?)I'll check the behavior of these stuffs while they work and I'll try to extend my review in few months..."
2,"its so,so!!! but dont buy!!!!!! bad building!!!!!","Ok truth is i bought 2 of these, the first 1 i got was packaged very well and when i went to plug up sounded even better, which is a great thing. Now my second one i recieved came to me broken and i sent back right away!!!! Good thing is that if u take good care of this monitor it will do good for u!!! Bad thing is that it was built very cheap which explains the price!!! The wood is very cheap wood and the plastic on the monitor is not very durable thats y i say u have to take real good care of it!!! Now if u bought this to be traveling with, then thats not a good idea but if u bought this for like a home studio or something where its not moving alot/at all, then u might be ok but i would not recommend this item!!!!"
4,Hulkkonen defines the Finnish House-Sound,"With Selkäsaari Tracks (1st Finnish house album on a major European label) Hulkkonen delivered what his earlier tunes had promised. A true icon in the clubland, he proceeded to establish his supremacy with the 1998 follow-up ""The Spirits Inside Me"". Selkäsaari Tracks features the hypnotic ""3rd Line"", known in Finland for the vocal sample originally sung by Fredi, a folk artist. Throughout the album Hulkkonen displays his seminal, French-influenced style, finally reaching the climax in ""Heights"", a true masterpiece of a build-it-up tech-house. Ideal for every serious house-fan, this should keep the party going until the early morning."
2,"Good qualit, but did not work for me.","The seller was quick on delivery. However, the product was not compatible with my Video Camera. They quickly gave me a refund. I would buy from them again, making sure they have what I need.I was very satisfied with the service and professionalism they provided me.Thank you"
4,No need for track skipping....,"Hey guys and gals! This cd is sooooo refreshing after having spent over $100 on Christian cds that could only produce 1-3 good songs. I was very disappointed. Especially the groups that have one hit single and the rest of the album is hardcore rock. Of course you can probably tell that I'm all about pop ... but I'm also about good vocals...and an album that shows that the vocalist's heart was put into the lyrics. The lyrics are very meaningful, the tunes are upbeat and fun... and Nate even talks about his town in one of the songs. This was like WOW to me... cos few artists tell you who they ARE in their albums... but since Nate wrote most or all of the songs... he really gives a good impression. I liked the cd from the moment I put it into my boombox. I don't have to skip any tracks and I recommended Nate to my best friend right away!"
1,Reviews out of date & detail lacking,Many restuarant reviews are way out of date. e.g. lists a restuarant in the Galleria that closed 5 years ago (still listed in 1999 edition).Map is far too small to be of use.Have shown it to some Houston residents and they agree the reviews are not accurate.One bookshop said that they would give a refund because restuarant guide is so poor (wish I'd kept the receipt).
2,no picnic,"You will have to select which input in the menu, so if you were to plug in an S-video signal, it won't just automatically recognize it which is pretty lame when you want to switch between TV and other signals. Quality of picture recording is okay, but I've seen better elsewhere, especially in Sony's. All in all, I really don't like it. There are numerous little quirky things that just irritate me."
2,Horrible compatability.,"It looks nice. JVC is the inventor of S-VHS, but this machine was so frustrating, I took it back within 48 hours. Programming was difficult to trudge through. The remote is one of the worst I have seen (extremely poor ergonomics). A very unfriendly machine to use.If you really want S-VHS try one from Sony or a high brand like Denon or Mitsubishi."
5,Perfect!,"Absolutely love it! It's great for anyone who wants to do sit-ups but who doesn't have a partner to hold their feet. Easy to assemble and very simple to install, it is a snap to get it working and when not in use, it folds against the door or can easily be removed."
3,Reasonable hardware,Attaches to the door easily enough but the hardware construction doesn't feel 100% solid. Also there is a bit of travel on the arm that doesn't inspire confidence that this thing will last for a long time.
1,Does not work - will not hold feet in place,"On the surface this appears to be a great way to hold your feet in place when doing sit-ups and then it can flip out of the way for storage. Unfortunately, it does not have any way to lock in place for sit-ups and therefore does not hold your feet in place. Would NOT recommend."
2,Gravity works,"The fold-up feature of this bar looks nice on paper, but doesn't work. When it's folded up it is top-heavy and ends up falling onto the floor, making it difficult to open and close the door."
3,does the job but not as advertised,"I bought this so I could work on my sit-ups without wedging my feet under the sofa. It's easy to assemble (no instructions but you really don't need them unless you can't figure out how to bolt the foam foot bar to the unit's arm). It attaches to the door very easily. My only gripe is that the arm does not stay folded up against the door when not in use. I was expecting some kind of spring or lock that would keep the arm up against the door. Sadly the arm keeps falling down to the floor. Fortunately it doesn't stick out too far, but if you're not careful you can step on or trip over it."
2,does not give support,"I wanted some thing I could put my feet under to hold them down when i did sit-ups, but the flat bar that is attached to the heng is too long. If there was no heng and the bar was shorter this might be better. I do not recommend this product."
5,great exerciser,fit on the bottom of door and will not scrape wooden door. very durable to do situp with. i am 65years old can do them very well with it
3,You need a thick/sturdy door,This was an ok product. You need a thick door so it won't puncture through and it stays in place.
2,Not for those with small feet,"My wife bought this and when it arrived she discovered that someone with ""small"" (women's size 9) feet simply can't get the required leverage for the bar to be effective. The bar is too far away from the door and her feet just float around. It didn't come with any assembly instructions but since there are only two pieces I'm pretty sure we put it together correctly. Nice concept but we'll be returning it."
4,A Wrench Works,"This product works just fine. For those complaining that it doesn't remain in the upright position, note that there is a nut and bolt that can be very easily adjusted with a wrench to tighten the torsion on the device."
3,Everlast Sit Up Bar,"The product is ok, but the bar does not stay in place very well to hold the feet down."
4,Works Great!,"Great product for the price. It works just as advertised and has given me much agony (is that a good thing?). The only thing I would change is the three inches of adjustment screw that protrude from the back of the door. Unless this was designed to be used on a ricepaper door, the adjustment rod is simply too long. However, this is certainly not a significant issue. Great product!"
2,They could make it better,"I had to modify mine to hook/hold my foot better. I'm 5'8"" maybe for those taller people it's not a problem."
3,A mixed bag,"it's more of a compliation than a album....the beats are high quality for most the album, although the emcees aren't consistantley good...LMNO from the crew Visionaires does catch wreck...the song Fourth Quarter has a fresh hypnotic beat....still, some of the album tends to get boring, due to a few not-so-tight emcees...check out other Project Blowed material for better results."
4,new and different,unlike the other review i am just amazed at the music and the somw of the emcees lmno is good but shaydie and otherwoze are better.wiz and mone catch some wreck prduction and song wise!waiting for a new forest album!
4,Head Candy: an antidepressant,"Improves my mood and slows my breathing (no kidding!) Also calms my road rage.It may not be pleasing for someone whose looking for traditional classical, but give it a try playing at a low volume in the background."
2,The best but not the very best,"Rhino tried to do their job here to make a selection from the best kwown albums out of Todd's entire carriere span.The overall result is a litle bit sloppy.It makes the listener think that most of Todd Rundgen's songs give the imression that's all about wining.Not enough rock'n'roll here,too many ""love songs"".If you want the very best of Todd Rundgen,you better try ""Initiation"".That was his ""vey best period"".Sadly,only one song is featured on this selection,adaptly named ""Real man"".Indeed."
2,Not impressed,"I used to be into Todd Rundgren back in the early '70's. But when he started doing Utopia, I quit listening. I haven't heard him since the mid-70's. So I decided to get this CD to hear some old stuff and newer stuff that I missed.I can't believe I liked him at all. When listening with headphones on, the production is horrible. Sure, some songs have good melodies, but the production is so bad (irritating, in fact), it makes it difficult to listen to."
4,"Good Starter, could have used a couple more tracks","This is a good starter CD for anyone who is learning about Todd's music, but it barely scratches the surface about who Todd is (and thats hard to explain because he kept trying to re-invent himself on every LP during his prime in the 1970's)Rhino has a few other 1-CD budget comps of Todd's stuff but they are very cheap and skimpy - get this one instead to see if you like him or not. (I think you will!) My only gripe is the liner notes which someone should have re-edited. Todd is very critical and sometimes very negative about his early music (which I adored).All his well known ""hits"" are here, but I would have loved to also have had ""Sometimes I Dont Know What To Feel"", ""Time Heals"" and the underrated ""Parallel Lines"" from his last great CD, ""Nearly Human""."
4,Good introduction to a 'true star',"Pop-oriented as this collection is, it still indicates the wide range of Todd Rundgren's interests...from flat-out rockers ('Very Last Time') to ballads ('Love is the Answer) to soul ('Want of a Nail,' which has some occasional vocals from Bobby Womack.It also shows off Rundgren's best instrument: His mind, which allows each of these songs to contain passion, sensitivity and intelligence. Listeners who understand that will enjoy this collection, and be tempted to seek out Rundgren's more adventurous experimental work."
4,Good sampler,"I've been a fan of Todd's since I first heard NAZZ as a teenager but I can certainly understand why many people don't get him or don't care one way or another. He's eclectic, for sure. But there's no one like him. He's pop, rock, fusion and fun. Not every song on here is a gem and some leave me scratching my head as to why it is considered one of his ""best"" but by the time I get to the song about playing his drum all is forgiven. What he hasn't lost is what I like most about him. His sense of humor and his ability to not take himself or his music too seriously. As greatest hit packages go this one is as good as you can expect for someone as unique as Mr. Rundgren."
4,A trip into time,"I remember hearing alot of these songs on the radio while growing up, but never could remember any names that belonged to it. Then recently I heard my favorite song on a classic rock station. Once the DJ announced it as ""Bang The Drum All Day"", I was all over it. I picked up this CD and haven't put it down ever since. I recommend the working man buy this CD and play it as soon as he breaks out of work on every Friday. It's worth it."
3,It makes a difference,"Ok set of Todd's solo and group work, but I would argue the exclusion of ""It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference"". Beautiful ballad, and one of his nicer melodies.With most CDs able to hold over 70 minutes of music, wouldn't it be great if for just one time, all the cuts you really wanted WERE on a Best of / Greatest Hits package?!"
3,I would think you know all of the songs on this recording.,Todd Rundgreen can be a great song writer when he wants to be. Some great moments on this CD accompanied by some commercial campiness!!
5,This is a Blast!,"This is Todd Rundgren at his comic best; I can't listen to ""Bang The Drum"" without smiling and laughing each time. As usual, the price was better than I can get it for locally, even including shipping. Fast service, and well packaged; THANKS!"
4,"Excellent Picture, Provided You Use S-VHS Tapes","Just got one for Christmas. I like it. Picture quality in EP mode, using S-VHS tape, is better than SP mode in regular VHS machines using regular tape. That means you can get 6 hours of very good resolution on a single tape, making it very good for timer recordings. S-VHS in SP mode is near DVD quality, if source is, for example, a DVD. But you only get two hours in SP mode.My only gripe is that the much touted S-VHS-ET is a joke. With regular tape, I get better quality using the regular VHS setting . In fact, the picture is quite good in regular VHS mode, though nowhere near S-VHS quality. So just plan on investing in S-VHS tape (about $5, nowadays) if you want to get a genuine improvement over regular VHS. And it really is an improvement."
4,Well worth the (dollar amount),"I've had excellent results from the s3900 over the year or so I've had it. I bought the unit to dub what I'd shot using my Panasonic PV-DV900 MiniDV and have found it to deliver consistently good results at a price in line with non-SVHS units.Make no mistake, this is no professional deck, however. The s3900 is lighter than most I've used (perhaps due to a lack of internal shielding) and the jog/shuttle control is frustrating in it's ""springiness"" ... I've had it slip in my fingers at particularly inopportune moments.On the plus side, the pause control is lightning-quick (the editing method most home movie editors will employ), the sound quality very good, unit seems durable, good tuner, etc...When compared to Panasonic's PV-S9670 at (dollar amount), you can buy two S3900's and dub between them, or keep an extra around as a spare."
4,Great insights,"What happened to the hippies? This book is a profile of (and by) one of the most colorful people from Woodstock: Wavy Gravy, aka Hugh Romney.Funny, sad and insightful, this book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand what the hippie movement -- and its aftermath -- looked like from the inside."
5,Something Good for Earth People....,"Wavy Gravy and the Hog Farm collected money in barrels at the Woodstock Festival in 1969 to be used for Earth People's Park, a multi-acre live-in community farm in Vermont, USA.Feds came in with planted guns, kilos of marijuana, and search and arrest warrants, all based on public fear of the unknown and rumours about the reputations of people who augment their state of consciousness.Earth People's Park wound up becoming the ""property"" of the ""State"" via plea bargainingand forfeiture, teaching everyone to put Paradise above 'getting high' in importance.Read about that and many other great, interesting and funny stories in this classic book."
5,Very Well Done,"I'm not a professional ""reviewer"" by any means, but I just had to post a review here 'cause I can't believe no one else has. This disc just plain out-and-out rocks. Killer riffs, great vocals - very soulful and well composed. Give it a try. One of the hardest workin' bands in the biz.By the way, I also really dig High on Fire. If you like that, you'll most likely be pleased with this as well."
4,A book that I can't forget,Some books like some movies stay with you. I learned so much about what happened in Scotland from Hunter's very interesting accounts. This book has made the kind of impression that compells me to reread it and loan it to others. It's a keeper in my bookcase now for reference. Now I am in the process of visiting those places both in Scotland and in America where these displaced peoples were sent.
1,Not worth the money,"I give the film a ""D"" for development. There is no real reason for this film to exist other than the few moments of humility you'll see. Don't spend the money on it - rent it or netflix it."
2,Jeep Straps,"These straps are WAY too long. The original ones on the jeep were about an inch shorter which kept the door from flying open and tapping against the front of the jeep. When I ordered the strap I had to be very specific about which jeep I owned, so I expected the same size strap. NOPE."
3,Possible End of World Scenarios Reviewed,"I'm a devoted disaster movie buff and will watch most anything devoted to world-wide destruction. While most of the movies in that genre are rather poor there are sometimes those that manage to work in a reasonable human interest story to supplement the destruction; this is not one of those, it is a sort of documentary of rather well known ""end of the world as we know it"" theories.I did find it interesting enough to watch it all the way through but will probably not watch it again. There were really no new thoughts presented which made it much more of a review than a revelation. I suggest this one be viewed on streaming video before buying; perhaps you will enjoy it enough to buy the DVD."
2,END OF TIME,The documentary was very turgidly portrayed. Could have been completely told in about 30 minutes. The black hole segment sounded a bit farfetched.
2,Real Title: Thinking of Ways to Destroy the Earth When You are Bored At Work,"This really did not need to be much longer than 45 min. The CERN segment has now been proven ""wrong"" as the Haydron collider has been running and we are still here, at least I think. The climate science is also out of date. Wish they would have talked more about the climate change due to the change in the Earth's orbit.But still, this gives you ammunition for when you are bored out of your mind during meetings at work. The alien and robot attacks need some equally out-of-this-world solutions. Let your mind run wild and the meeting will be over before you know it."
3,2nd Compilation STILL Incomplete!!!,"This is the 2nd Naughty By Nature compilation (following Tommy Boy's 'Nature's Finest' from 1999), and this release from Rhino isn't a complete collection of Naughty's hits. Like the earlier CD, this collection is missing 2 big hits, namely 'Jamboree' (featuring Zhane), and Naughty's major hit from 2002, 'Feels Good' (featuring 3LW). If Rhino & Tommy Boy can't release a definitive compilation for Naughty By Nature, I urge fans to take matters into their own hands. In short, MAKE YOUR OWN CDs, and ignore these half-baked collections from the record companies!"
2,a disappointment,"This book is in need of some editing help (the term ""weigh station"" is way off and I was looking for a diet or a trucker story, and that's just the beginning), and ""Butt Hutt"" may be one of the dumbest & most offensive erotica stories I've ever read. A couple of great stories from big writers (Queen, Indigo, Christian) does not make up for the rest of this dreck. It's a close runner-up to ""Aqua Erotica"" for the worst erotica anthology around, but at least you can read the print!"
3,"Lots of stories, with a few good ones","I can't complain about the price for what you get with this book - there are a ton of stories. Lots I couldn't read though, and some that weren't sexy at all. I love Isabelle Caruther's story, and Susanna Indigo's too, but I always like womens' stories the best. The overall quality isn't as high as Susie Bright's or Marcy Sheiner's books, but what's good in it is really good!"
5,"Despite cuts, BEST LUCIA EVER!!!","I'm sure this will infuriate the Italian opera oriented readers I seem to infuriate with the most bargain attempts are any kind of objective criticism, but the qualities that raise this recording above all others are:1. Excellent singers that work as a unified group not just individual stars. (The performance of the famous sextet is a revelation.)2. Singers free of the whooping and scooping, huffing and puffing common to most Italian oriented singers. They actually follow dynamic markings, phrase indications, and though in German, project the meaning of the words. This is probably due to them spending the greater part of their respective careers with music of greater quality and overall substance.3. A first class conductor who, for once, approaches the work with a high degree of musical respect."
4,O.K. but could be better for the money¡,"This CD is nicely arrainged ,but for the price it could be better. Marc Nelson is no Carl Thomas or Donell Jones for that matter. The best song on this CD is ""15 minutes"" and all talks about is ""getting up in it""."
2,Not what I expected....,"Being a fan of Marc's former group Az Yet and his debut single ""15 minutes"" I went out and purchased this album. This is definitely not what I expected for Marc Nelson's debut based on his previous work with Az Yet and the reviews this album recieved from critics. 15 Minutes is by far the best track on this whole cd. Most of the other tracks aren't worth listening to twice because the beats and lyrics are weak. Maybe next time Marc."
5,Tasty Pop Rock,"Well thought out, catchy pop rock! Eloquent songwriting, impeccable musicianship, this CD is chock full of really great songs. Check it out."
5,Superb!!,"This is a superb video tribute to the beautiful,reknowned actress Eva Gabor.It's highly reccommended!!"
5,Perfect introductory manual,"This is a great book. I read this book for my methods and theories class and it was very complete and easy to understand. Especially helpful are the explicit ""real life"" examples of the text comcepts. I would recommend this book to trained archaeologists, 'armchair' archaeologists and students."
5,This is a wonderful textbook.,"It is well written, and lavishly illustrated. It is the kind of book that makes you want to get up and start an excavation. If you are interested in the past, and how to figure out the mysteries of the past, then this book is a gold mine. I loved the way that it took complex subjects and made them so easy to understand. Why it was enjoyable. What a wonderful and special book. I really recommend this book."
3,good book,"hepled with research and thesis, was good guide for methods and implemnentationthe other topics were also interesting but thats for another time as I further my studies"
3,Mother-in-law goes back to school,my 87 year old M-i-L is at SFSU this semester. Taking an Archaeology Methods course. The only thing I know about the book is it's damned expensive. Glad I could get it used from Amazon
5,Great recourse! Highly Recommend!!!,"I got this after failing my first calculus test, and I have to tell you, he results are amazing! Mr. Ryan really explains things in a down-to-earth, non-technical way, and it's a breath of fresh air to read. I just wish I had started reading this at the beginning of the semester, now I have too much to catch up on! Also, make sure you know your algebra. Most of the problem isn't the calculus, it's the algebra you have to do afterward."
2,One major Flaw with this book,"This book has a major flaw in it--no examples! After reading a chapter, you have no idea if you've truly grasped the concept because there are no--none--exercises or sample problems. I am certain it is a ploy to get you to buy the Calculus for Dummies workbook. This is a frustrating book because of this."
5,My Calculus Bible,"I could always DO calculus, but I never really 'understood' it. The explanations in this book worked, where the many textbooks I have used failed. Hats off to the author for a most excellent approach to simplifying the 'whats and whys' of a challenging and confusing subject."
4,Good reference for Calc course work,You need both this andCalculus II For Dummiesto complete Calc course for reference and self-study guide. It provide great examples and techniques to solve problems and a great help !! I think they did a great job of making life easier for a calc stuff for either reference or class use.
4,Calculus for Dummies,"A good effort at presenting a difficult subject, but in the end, even though this book helps in understanding the principals involved, the subject matter is still extremely complex and even though I was able to follow all the worked examples, I still find it is difficult to stay on track when working alone."
4,calc for dummies,it helped me alot to understand what is going on or why im doing something for calc. when you understand you can you dont get as confused so you can learn more efficiently.
1,Too Simple,"This book spends the first 8 chapters reviewing basic algebra and geometry. Then it starts with limits, which is a good chapter. After that, the book is out of control. The derivative part makes it more confusing than a textbook and it has minimal examples. It also did not cover many important calculus concepts. Dont buy the Calculus Workbook because those problems are too easy. The only helpful thing was the yellow review card in the front. I would absolutly not recommend this for a college student. It only helps you through 2/3 of the first semester. Just stick with your ol'textbook."
3,appalling lack of examples,"I think Mark does a good job explaining differentiation in the first part of the book. He is entertaining! He lost me in the second section on Integration. He explains the concept, glosses over one example and then he's on to the next concept. I became frustrated on two concepts because I could not follow his examples. Why not have some practice problems, with answers in the back?"
5,Calculus for Dummies - Simpliest Calculus Book Out There,"This is the most simpliest book on the most difficult math I've seen yet. This is great! I love it. It explains it in words that I can understand. Most of the books I have seen don't even come close. If you want to learn calculus, get this book! I recommend it. Highly!For the longest time, when I read other books, I had a hard time understanding what y=3x+5 means (for example). This books explains that down to the detail where other books don't. And I am slow at learning math so this tells me from the starting point - which is exactly what I need. Otherwise, what's the point?Great book!"
2,it doesn't work,"for me there has to be a ""calculus for pre-dummies"", because ""calculus for dummies"" is not adequate. i had all the basic math courses in high school and college but could not grasp the concepts as presented in these books. for one thing, symbols are not adequately explicated, and if you don't understand symbols in the various types of math, you are hopelessly lost - or at least i am. the one redeeming feature is the humor injected into the explanations."
4,great!,"I'm about half way through this book so far and it's really helped me out. I haven't taken a math class in in 2 1/2 years and now I'm using this book as a refresher before I jump into claculus 2. It's super easy to understand and has a laid back tone to it which I enjoy. The only thing I wish it had was a list of problems I could attempt at the end of each chapter or something so it'd stick better, although I guess theat's what the calculus for dummies workbook is for."
5,Drop every other calculus book and get this one.,"The Author, Mark Ryan, bush wacks all the clutter away. This is by far the best Calculus book I've owned and I own a few. He gets right into the concepts in a easy to understand way and breaks all the ideas down into ways you can relate to (no calculus pun intended). There are no long draw out cryptic proofs filled with a gazillion veriables and symbols and hard to understand einsteinian math-lingo. There is just an easy to understand method of learning calculus. If you are learning limits, differentiation, integrals, series or summation for the first time get this book as your primary source of understanding the mumbo jumbo your teacher will be rambling on about in your class. If you want a refesher book this is excellent as well."
4,B+ Supplement Book!,I find the book helpful but not quite enough to cover all incuding preparation for calculus. It serves as a good textbook supplement.
2,not realy helpful,"It is okay, if your teacher is terrible this will help A LITTLE. Honestly, this book tries so hard to make calculus interesting that it ends up making it worse. The examples are useless. The explanation of limits is so confusion. It barely spent 2 pages on continuity. I don't recommend it, its not ""user friendly"". I am going to buy another book because this one failed to meet my satisfaction.I am an AP Calculus student"
4,"Great Book, from Author of ""Calculus In Focus""","Calculus for Dummies is a masterfully written exposition that excels in clarity. If you have been out of school for a long time but are looking for a clearly written, quick review, I highly recommend it. I also believe that this book is a must as a companion to the main text for calculus students having a tough time. It does not have many solved examples, but clarifies the concepts in a remarkable way. Covers the standard topics in a first semester course such as limits, derivatives, max-min problems, and integration. I believe they have published a workbook which would be essential to really grasping the subject since this one doesn't have solved problems in abundance."
4,calculus for dummies,Order arrived quickly. Hopefully some helpful info but tutoring is the best for my son in the situation given. It makes a good reference.
5,This book will change your life!!!11!!!1!!shift!1!!1,"If your professor has a tendency to over complicate the complicate by speaking in riddles and giving questions which can only be answered by more questions, then look no further. For less than 5 cups of coffee, you can build a figurative bridge (the book) that can help you get from point A (ignorance) to point B (calculus glory) with relative ease. This magical book speaks sense in a world that makes no sense. It makes the invisible visible. It makes the unthinkable thinkable. It makes the undo-able seem doable.If you haven't done much math to begin with, the first few chapters breaks down all the basic stuff you need to know. Also, the front cover comes with formulas and expressions that you will likely use over and over again.Buy this book, read it and keep it for later."
5,Great book! Helped me a lot!,"I bought this book before starting Calculus 1. It has helped me so much!Our school uses James Stewart's Early Transcendentals which I cannot freaking stand, for both lack of clarity and mind-numbing approach.The author of this book, Mr. Ryan, uses clear, reality based explanations that really made the difference for me. He also puts in a lot of unmnemonic devices that help those who aren't so good at memorizing things (like me), that were 10x better than my instructor's. He also points out which techniques are the most challenging, so you know what to get extra practice on.Great, great book! I really struggle with math concepts and this book definitely helped me out, and was a great companion to the classes.My only complaint would be that the last few sections the author skimmed through rather quickly (series convergence tests, etc).This book helped me out through Calc 1, Calc 2 and about halfway through Calc 3. Highly recommend!"
2,Weak Calculus Guide fo $19.99,"If you're simply looking for a manual to brush up on some points in introductory calculus or you're taking a calculus course that does not emphasize real-world applications of Calculus-based mathematics, then this book might be useful. Otherwise, it simply does not go into the breadth and depth necessary for a serious Calculus student, especially when physics problems are introduced into the curriculum. If you've purchased Dummies guides in the past, you're probably already familiar with the middle American English prose found throughout the pages of this text, while some may find this moderately off-putting. There are more serious guides available, such asSchaum's Outline of Calculus, 5ed: Schaum's Outline of Calc, 5ed (Schaum's Outline Series)"
5,Calculus for Dummies - Ryan,Very understandable! Arrived on time and in perfect condition.Am using this book as a refresher in order to read about catastrophe theory.Thanks indeed.
4,Good!,I need help with calculus so bad and when I purchase this book it was my buddy. It has alot of examples that you can look at and you would understand the concept much better. I found this book very helpful especially if you have a professor who does not teach well.
2,Not for AP Calc Students,The AP class covers the material in this book in the first month or so of school. This book is for people who may need a few calc concepts but not for AP students.
5,David Allan Coe CD,"Bought this for my 29 yr old son, he listens to it all the time. It's great, Glad I bought cd for him."
3,TAN TAO LIANG IS GREAT.....,"Maybe not the best movie on the world, but it buy it to see taekwondo's master tan tao liang kicking style. Lot's of kicking on this one, is too sad that the rest of the cast don't be as you good as tan is, maybe that's the bad thing of this movie, the final fight was a bit disapointing. But there's not too many tan movies on the market right now so if you're a Tan Tao Liang fan, you better buy it before desapered..the other movie, Snake Killer one, is very bad."
5,Delux carmel candy,"This is a wonderful carmel candy. I now know why it was the best selling carmel candy from Amazon customers. Melts in your mouth and has a great after taste. It is very soft and not the usual gummy variety of carmel, which I like as well."
1,I have to disagree with the Rebecca Review,"I received a few of these in a sample pack sent to me by Amazon Grocery. All I can say is Bleeeecchh!Personally, I found the taste to horrible. The texture reminded me of lighter, crumblier mellow mint(which I like). Mellow Mint might be the wrong name. I do not see them to often. They are wrapped in a green and silver wrapper if that sounds familiar."
5,Great DVD Player at a Super Price,"I bought this DVD player mainly to play SVCDs that I burn on my computer. I had an Apex 600A, but I had all sorts of trouble with it recognizing SVCDs (Sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't). The Pioneer unit recognizes them consistantly and plays them with better quality. It also plays DVDs great. This is a really great player for the price. The only negative I can find (and it is minor) is the size of the buttons on the remote. The buttons are very small and it is easy to hit more than one at a time. But the quality of the rest of the unit clearly out-weighs this small problem."
1,OK.....for first few months,I have the same problem as Gary up there. It worked fine for about 3 or 4 months and now it gets stuck and I have to press fast forward to get it going again. Sometimes it gets stuck in the Menu mode and I have to stop it all together. I've cleaned it and it still messes up. Unfortunately Im stationed overseas and don't even have a Pioneer Repair shop to take it too. I would defintely pass on this DVD player.
1,2 lemons in a row,"Back around Christmas of 2001 we found this unit for sale on base (Military) ... so we bought 2 of them for the house. The first one started having all kinds of track search problems on the DVD side of things and is waiting for me to drive it to the nearest Pioneer service center. Now I just got back from a vacation and powered up the 2nd unit to watch some DVDs I bought ... NO DICE. It won't play anything. It recognizes DVDs as what they are, but fails on finding the menu. It sees VideoCDs as regular CDs, but won't play them. It sees music CDs for what they are, but won't play them either. 2 in a row. Needless to say, my family will not be buying anymore Pioneer home equipment. Must be under a different quality control division than their car stereo equipment I guess."
2,it was broken when it got here,"When my player arrived we hooked it up and put a dvd in.Only it wouldn't take the dvd. A spring was sticking out in the way. So we took it apart and couldn't figure out where the spring went. The dvd will go in now, but will start shaking and it is spit right back out. The player won't work and I'm very angry right now!!!"
2,Unhappy!!!!,This player is picky about certain dvd's sometimes i can't bring up the main menu. sometimes the player will begin a dvd in the middle of a movie. why? It was fine for 2 1/2 months then boom it wouldn't play my dvd's. iam mad. i haven't sent it out for repair yet. but until i do it only get's 2 stars. My vcr was cheaper and i bet it will last longer........Pioneer better work it out or they will loose a lot of business.......
1,Disappointed Pioneer Fan,"My advice is not to waste time and money investing in one of these DVD players. If you buy three of these DVD players, perhaps two will work for you. I bought one as a 2001 Christmas present for my son to go with his Pioneer A/V receiver. It play fine for two months and stopped working in March 2002. We tried all of the trouble shooting fixes, used a DVD disc cleaner and installed new A/V cables. The pioneer representative said that it was a laser pick up problem. Nothing (DVD, CD, etc.) will play on it. So off to the repair shop it goes. Hardly, what you would expect from a quality Pioneer product. It is fortunate that there is a one year warranty on parts and labor, otherwise it would be a large paper weight."
2,"Skips easily, doesn't play DVD-R","I bought the dvd player two years ago, and it is already skipping with lightly scratched DVDs. Also, the machine does not play DVD-R (home-burned DVDs) well at all, so I suggest you buy an upgrade machine. Even if you do not burn your own DVDs, you may receive some from friends."
1,Its not worth buying,"I bought this dvd player, to play the 50 dvds we already have and we tryed 40 in this machine and only 2 would play.It was a real disapiontment."
4,Great first DVD player,"I bought one of these for my Dad as his first DVD player, and he loves it. It was easy to set up and has great image quality on his relatively new 32"" Sony TV.I've had great luck with Pioneer equipment and so felt it was a better choice than the equivalent Panasonic or Toshiba players, and wasn't disappointed by my choice..."
5,great dvd player,this dvd player has played every type of media i threw at it. all of my vcd/xvcds have played on it. i would reccomend it for everyone. at this price i would take it over any cheapo brand
1,Ugh.,This was an out-of-the-box-right-back-into-the-box purchase. The motor is ridiculously loud. Don't waste your time.
4,This is not for PAL DVD's,"It is OK. I like it. In Amazon.com technical preview was noted that this model could run both NTSC and PAL DVD's, that why I bought it. But when I put my Multizone PAL based DVD, which I previously watch in color using my PHILIPS computer DVD drive, was screened just in black and white. I was very disappointed because of that. Unfortunately this model is working just in NTSC system. Anything else is OK."
2,Disappointment in a small package,"Do not be fooled the the description on the CD sleeve. This doesn't have wailing pipes or zinging guitars. This is a CD I use when I cannot sleep, that is how mellow it is. 'Keltik Electrik' is anything but......I was pulled in by the description and wasted my money, do not do the same. Unless you WANT to buy some sleep music, but then I'd suggest the Nature Set."
4,orginal fun,"by orginal artists, this is an upbeat cd that includes hard to find singles which are arranged nicely to keep the flow."
4,nice collection of Gershwin,"I got this CD primarily for the piano solo version of Rhapsody in Blue. Most solo performances of this work sound very thin without the lush 200 piece orchestra to support the piano. I am pleased to say Ms. Buechner has a big rich sound and nice interpretation.However, the listing of the pieces on the back cover and liner notes mismatched the tracks. They're correctly listed on Amazon's product overview page and showed up correctly when I ripped the CD onto my MP3 player, but the errors on the printed material are annoying."
3,Solo piano recordings of Gershwin are few,"Solo piano recordings of Gershwin are few, and I am in search of one that will transport me back to my childhood, when my grandmother played Rhapsody In Blue for the family. The recording quality is excellent. Sara Davis Buechner is amazing. Her fingers fly flawlessly over the keys. My criticism is that the music often sounds rushed. Overall, this is an enjoyable CD if you love Gerswhin, but I prefer Alicia Zizzo's interpretation and playing of Rhapsody In Blue."
1,so dispointed!,Not worth the price I used them once for an hour and my feet never hurt so bad thank god i had my ugg boots with me! I wish i would of walk around the house with them first so i could of return them.
3,JVC HR-FS1U VHS Player,"Product could not be sent to APO/FPO address for some unknown reason, that in itself was disappointing. Had to have sent to family member first, then sent to my APO address.Product shipped without remote, should not be a problem as there are many universal remotes on the market. However, no remote reflects poorly on the seller which is the only reason I gave a 3 star rating.Other than the above, the VHS player functions as advertised."
3,20th century was forgotten by the author,"""Money & Power"" is an interesting book about the men that made significant contributions to the history of business since St. Godric. However, the 20th century is not accurately represented in the book. Basically, ""Money & Power"" forgot the contribution that japanese entrepreneurs like Eiji Toyoda (and his famous Toyota Production System) made to the industrial manufacturing. The book also superficially reviewed the computer technology/telecommunication revolution that has been modyfing the business world since the 70's (although there is a chapter dedicated to Bill Gates). eCommerce is not even mentioned in the book."
5,Bravo to Money & Power,This is a great read and an exciting tale of how money moguls of yesteryear created dynasties and how moguls of today are taking the it a step further.h. patterson
5,FASCINATING AND MIND-GRABBING!,"The book presents an inside view of the history of business and its development over the years. From the 12th century monk, St. Godric to Bill Gates and Microsoft, this well-researched book outlines the history of industry, commerce and power. As a counsellor and teacher of business management, I will highly recommend this literary masterpiece to my students. Before we can advance in industry and commerce, it is equally important to understand the roots...where and how it all began. Who wouldn't be captivated by the Rothschilds or Robert Woodruff and Coca-Cola? My only regret is that the book ended all too soon. There are other mega empires that are not mentioned here - maybe there will be a sequel to this book in the future."
2,Little there,Where's the beef?I am seriously disappointed with the level of detail provided in this book. There are too few subjects represented and the few selected - far too little said. If you're looking for insights... keep looking. If you're looking to find out what made these people tick... search on. If you're looking for a significant list of WHO'S WHO in the history of business... this isn't even a good index. I rarely comment on the books I purchase through Amazon but this one was disappointing enough that I'm just shooting a warning flare for anyone who takes their time seriously. If you want a light read - I'll give it a green light for that.
3,"Ehhhh, i'm not very satisfied",The system didn't have the sound quality i was looking for. I have bought this exact product in a store and the price is just not worth it. The package is small and so is the sound. My advice is to keep looking.
4,Easy Classroom Cooking,"This book has easy and fun to make recipes for the classroom with no cooking required. I like the step-by-step directions with visual illustrations. It also includes literature connections, poems, songs, and theme related extension activities. Each child assembles their own portion so there is no sharing of germs. No heat source is required. I've tried several recipes with my special education class (k-2) and my students have enjoyed them, and they have been easy for my students to prepare and clean up. Some recipes are fairly nutritious, but others contain ingredients that are sugary or have artificial flavors and color."
4,Great,I am an occupational therapist in a school system. I love that this books goes in order of the alphabet.
1,Discontinued,"According to the Kohler Website, this valve has been discontinued. The Kohler K-2975-KS valve appears to be a suitable substitute."
1,How disappointing,"Would you like to know what makes a good product? Actually including all the pieces. You know what else does? When you drill holes so it's easier to get the screws in, line them up properly.Two words: Never again."
2,Disappointed SOME MORE,"The price is great but the quality is not. I bought two of these. I assembled one and someone else assembled the other. They look practically identical, with the drawer slanted in the same direction. AND, I bought the matching dresser, and the drawers slant in the same direction."
2,Poor Quality,"Disappointed with the quality. Does not feel like a solid piece at all, annoying to assemble, and the drawer does not sit inside without being slightly crooked. Good price, but I'd spring a bit more and buy something that is more usable."
1,"Fragile, Bubles up, changes shades","Never will I ever turn to South Shore furniture again. The assembale is confuseing and all the pieces were not inclued. The prodect just sucks. It is fragile the top changes shades in sunlight and it bubles up if anything is left on it, like a cup from the moisture it gives off. It is just a horrible buy the only good thing is it comes wih a five year warrenty for parts. Yahhh I bought a whole bedroom set that is cra.p for my daughter."
4,Perfect! Took a while but it was worth it!,"We purchased this item because we already had the twin of it. It took a loooong while for it to ship, I was getting a little annoyed but once it arrived and my boyfriend put it together it was all worth the wait!"
4,Nice Nightstand for the money,"Just got done putting this nightstand togetgher and I must stay I am impressed for the money. The unit comes well packaged. The parts are well labeled and hardware packaged quite well. The unit is pretty easy to put together using the instructions and with my wife it took us just about 1 hour moving at a slow pace and stopping to watch tv for a few minutes from opening the package, taking out all the parts, gathering the necessary tools, and putting it all together. For us this nightstand looks to be a great value.The only thing I will say is I would like to see a few more words with the instructions.. there are good pictures and some words but a few more detailed words would go very far.Over all I'd buy it again."
4,Great Value for the Money,"I like this product, I also bought the 6 drawers dresser.Easy to mount, sturdy and nice looking!"
5,Night table,The product is excellent and we love it is great combination withthe bed and the rest of the furniture thanks.
4,Love This Set,"This takes probably half an hour to put together with 1 person. I purchased the whole bedroom set (bed, headboard, wardrobe, dressers, mirrors, night stands) I love that they all go together. Seems like a pretty solid set. I mean you're getting what you pay for this is ready to assemble furniture so you aren't getting solid wood fancy stuff, but for the price I love it and have gotten several compliments from friends. Also be sure to have screwdrivers, hammers, etc ready when you put this together. The drawer seemed to be the hardest part getting the screws in for all the pieces, but looks nice when it's finally all together."
1,do not buy,"I used this product once and it worked. Ever since, it has not worked.The battery does not make a connection and will never charge."
5,Funny and Makes you feel good,This is one of the best DVDs I own. Chonda is very funny. I loved every minute of it.
1,Buyer Beware - this item is NOT Erace 205,"This is not Max Factor Erace 205 Medium butis actually #03 Medium which is a quite different shade (distinctly orange) compared to the real #205.The site shows a picture of Max Factor Erace #205 in a sealed blister pack, but what isshipped are individual items that are neither packaged or sealed"
4,Meandering black humor,"My only semi-negative comment about this book is that if you're a person who expects/requires an essay writer to start with a thesis, prove it through argument and then return to it (i.e. have a point) you may find this book somewhat frustrating. I however am not one of those people and found Dekkers' morbid ramblings quite entertaining. (Especially when he goes on about rotten foods being delicacies and how his grandmother was an expert carrion-eater.) Recommended for goths. ;)"
2,Energizer 2025BP-2 lithium button cell battery ( 2 Count),"I received a item that was completely different from the one advertised and shown in the picture. What i got was a small package reading ""Energizer"" and it looked like a fake thing. The power of the battery is very low for it could not provide lights in my alarm clock like the one i had before. Please stay away from this item."
2,batteries are near expiration,"The batteries I received had a 2006 year on package. I looked up on the website that the battery life is 8 years. Even though they are not expired I would not consider them as ""fresh batteries"" The product did not come as appeared in picture, but cutoff a bigger sheet of some sort of value package. I would consider the price paid very low compared to the price I paid in the store but I rather have ""fresh batteries"" for my heart rate monitor. The product also took a long time to receive, two plus weeks."
5,Reliable battery,I bought these for being able to change my own watch batteries. They seem to last quite a while and are consistently reliable and a great value.
2,Quit dissapointed,"It looks new and is an Enegizer battery, although the packaging is not as shown, and looks old.I would not recommend it unless you don't actually have time or you are lazy to go to the shop."
2,Won't last long,"I used them for a electric weight scale; however, the size did not really match and the batteries only last about 2 weeks."
1,Worked about 1 month,I also got these in non retail packaging. I replaced the batteries in two remotes about a month ago and the batteries have died in both. I'm assuming I received dead batteries I do not recommend these batteries from this seller.
5,batteries are new,"new batteries, sealed package, work great. not much more i can say about these, i would recommend them to anyone!"
4,Debut of a popular Brazilian diva,"Nana Caymmi, daughter of songwriter Dorival Caymmi, is one of Brazil's most famous ballad singers. This is her debut album, from 1967. It's a little rough around the edges, but certainly worth checkking out."
5,I LOVE LUCY..............................,this is #9 and i have all dolls in this collection so far and thay just keep getting better and better i cant wait to see the next one LOVE these dollsMiss Bianca
3,Zany Lucy,This is yet another great LUCY doll. She is every bit the zany redhead as on the T.V.show. This couldn't be made any more perfect. It's like looking at the women herself. A real collectors item as with the rest of the series of dolls. I am just missing one of the dolls and I wouldn't sell my collection for anything. They made one Lucille Ball person and these dolls are just one of a kind like the lady herself. Good work Matel!
1,Collectible Barbie Doll,"Item exactly what I ordered except for the damaged box due tomediocre packing before shipped. Collectible item's condition must be ""new in box"". This item is now worth nothing to a realcollector. This is the eighth one in this series and the last oneI purchase from Amazon."
5,Kuch Kuch Hota Hai Fan,"I brought the movie over the summer and I had to purchase the CD even though I'm not from India.I'am Puerto Rican/Colombian. I love the movie so much that I learned to sing the songs from it. I think my kids are tired hearing me singing the whole soundtrack but I catch them humming to it too, LOL."
5,"Amazing... and true, too","I've always greatly enjoyed books by Ann Rinaldi, and ""Mine Eyes Have Seen"" is great. It tells about John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia from his 15 year-old daughter's point of view. John Brown was an abolitionist who was greatly against slavery, and the raid at Harper's Ferry, the main point of the book, was one of his many attempts to crush slavery. This book is also sad, but it is definitely worth reading. I also learned so much about the real event, like all of her other books too. In History class, we were learning about John Brown's raid, and I felt like I knew so much about it because of this book. Even my teacher said that I knew so much about it, and I recommended the book to her, and she is going to read it, just like you should, too!"
5,A Can't Put Down Read!,This is one of the best historical fictions I have read. The reader really gets invoved with Annies hardships and it was a great way for me to learn about the raid on Harpers Ferry! A must read!
2,Same old Thing: I do not recommend this Rinaldi Book,"Changed the character, changed the scene, changed the time period, and abracadabra! Another Rinadi historical fiction. This is a very tedious and winding novel that just shows that Rinaldi is running out of time periods out of history. I thoroughly enjoyed her WOLF BY THE EARS, and COLONIAL AMERICA stories, but this book was just to rediculous. Maybe Ann Rinaldi should consider trying to act out the lives of people in Europe (Elizabeth I, Lady Jane Grey, Ann Boleyn) and drop the whole American theme.I'd give this book 1 star because of it's weak content and obvious historical remarks, but threw in an extra star because Ann Rinaldi is one of the best historical writers I have ever come across. If you're a new Rinaldi reader, try her other more great works, but if you have read all her other novels, just might as well read this one."
4,More Fact and Drama than Fiction and Romance,"Rinaldi does a good job portraying Annie Brown, daughter of the famed John Brown- the man who tried to uproot the American government. Though most of Rinaldi's books are fact, this one has less romance and more drama- which is appropriate for the setting. Annie and another woman are living in a house with her father and a LOT of men(John's supporters) before their actual attack on Harper's Ferry. This book really gives you an insight to what it was probably like before the attack. If you want drama, this book is definitely for you! Typical Rinaldi characters- not so typical plots and settings."
4,stuhrling uptown ozzie,I really love this watch - i have a couple of stuhrlings - including this model with colored numbers on a white face and the model with the blue face. It is pretty large for a woman but i like large watches. if you aren't sure about the size it is better to measure it on your wrist before ordering - the dimensions are listed.
2,Disappointing,"I was interested in a fun, larger watch. This is huge, thick, and gaudy--which is kind of weird because the colored numbers on the face aren't nearly as bright as in the photo. It's really huge, like wearing a transistor radio on my wrist. Disappointed and will be returning this watch."
5,Awesome crockpot cook book,"We're a busy couple w/long daily commutes to work. With the recipes in this book and a crockpot all you have to do is buy the ingredients, put them in before going to work and dinner's served when you get home after a long day at the office."
4,"Even someone who ""can't boil water"" can make these recipes!","These recipes are super easy to follow and use healthy, low-fat, easy to find ingredients. I prefer this cookbook to the other ones for slow-cookers that use a lot of canned soup with hydrogenated oils. I also love that the author provides a shopping list. It really is a ""no-brain-er"" cookbook! She also has substitution tips that you can do to make the recipe even lower in fat and calories. She includes the nutritional information and portions for those following diet plans. Overall, this is an excellent slow-cooker cookbook with one caveat. I would not recommend putting cooked pasta in a slow cooker as it turns into one giant, mushy blob as I discovered making the goulash recipe. Cooked, brown rice holds up better in the slow-cooker."
3,Good recipes,This book had a lot of recipes. I'm really picky so didn't find a lot to try but the average person would probably really enjoy this cookbook.
2,disappointing,"Based on the reviews and author's slogan - ""America's Healthiest Mom"" - I was expecting something different, and far better, than run of the mill crock pot recipes. Sadly, this book is not it. The recipes are healthier only because they call for low-fat canned soup and low-fat bottled salad dressing. Many of the recipes are very similar, too similar to be included in the same cookbook. ""Fix It and Forget It"" has more variety, and if you use low-fat prepared ingredients, the same health quotient...""How To Make Love and Dinner"" gives more interesting and varied recipes. Bummer."
3,Quick and packaged,It seems like most of the recipes contain a can of cream of mushroom soup or something like that; frozen vegetables including onions. I wanted quick but also real food. I was disapointed but will try a few of the recipes.
5,Love this cookbook!,"I saw this cookbook recently while out and about and decided to order w/Amazon and give it a whirl. I like the fact that most of these recipes are easy and quick to throw together and let's the slow cooker do the rest! I've tried several recipes already (beef barley soup, pasta sauce and pork chops w/stuffing) and loved them all - the family, too! The ""shopping"" list on each page is also helpful to allow me to quickly look and see what I need for each recipe. They are indeed low fat, healthy and tasty and I will continue to use this book and recommend to friends and family."
3,Directions not abundantly clear,"Not much choice with this; you either need this rearm kit or you don't. For my first time replacement, I could have used better instructions. I wound up busting the bobbin on the first try. Luckily, I'd ordered two. Could not find this locally. Was easy enough to match the model number on the flotation device with the inventory at Amazon."
4,"Great themes, above average film score","Due to the source material, yes, the sound quality is comparatively poor, but it's still quite enjoyable.As a soundtrack, I'll admit that Tara's theme (and a couple others) are amazingly unforgettable, but I'm not sure the entire soundtrack works as cohesively as I would have liked. Nevertheless, the album is a solid purchase if you want to hear all the main cues from the film."
4,It stopped in the middle!!!!!!!!!!,"My only reason for giving this book 4 stars is that I am positive there MUST be a sequel coming and I personally felt that there could've been a better closing, rather than the cliff hanger we got. I personally liked figuring out the ""names"" and felt the characters were well developed and believable. I can't wait until the sequel!"
4,"Not what I expected, very enjoyable","Judging from the title I don't know what I expected this book to be about, but it was nothing like I expected. This book was very good, but knowing the ending I do have a couple of comments. Why the creator of the book when he first saw Maggie chose to make the ""Shadow Woman"" in the game a slave was not to my liking. It kind of had a demeaning quality to it. The second comment I have is that this book had no real ending. You turn the page expecting to hear what happended when they tried to return from this ""Virtual World"" and then nothing.....I was very disappointed in that. Now those things being said, this book was also a very good book. The characters kept my attention mostly because Maggie would not submit and act like a slave and the antics she got into where very funny. This book was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it to people."
2,Will fill a rainy day.,"Characters are well fleshed out. Story line is interesting. I was enjoying the book until I got looking at the names and other ""foreign"" words. Reverse them. Too cute and unoriginal, but still better than television."
2,Did not float my boat,"The plot sounded interesting-girl sent into virtual reality game and meets the perfect guy. The book soon became to boring for me though and I started skimming about half way through the book. When the author wrote something about the hero getting , um, lusty about another woman in some spa or such that's when I realized this book was not for me. The perfect hero may get lusty about another woman but I do not care to read about it and this hero was to boring and arrogant to be my perfect hero.For the personification of the perfect hero, in my opionion, Karen Marie Moning could not make them better."
3,interesting plot,"Well at first i wasn't sure I would like this book. I sounded a bit weird. The hero is a character in a virtual reality game that the heroine plays. Something goes wrong and she is suddenly in the game. Maggie, the heroine, is confused, and scared. She wants to go home and the hero Kered has a quest he must complete first before he can help her. They meet up with a friend of Kered's named Vad who has his own story in a later book. I liked this book but it took me a few days to read."
5,TOLEMAC BETTER THAN CAMELOT!,"If you like a brave, strong, gutsy heroine and a hero you can't get enough of, then Virtual Heaven is what you need. The premise is fun and exciting, the land itself breathtakingly beautiful but harsh in its own way. The story is well-written and keeps you turning those pages. A good, solid read and one I highly recommend. Ann Lawrence, let's see a sequel..."
3,Fun But Not What I Expected,"""Where Is The Chesterfield King"" is a fun watch but disappointing at the same time. Very enjoyable musically and takes you back to the mid 60's garage band sound. It was kind of a low budget poor version of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and not anywhere on par with ""Help"" or ""Head"". It does appear to be a hodge podge of all these type movies. Three stars say ""It's OK"" and two stars say ""I didn't like it"". I'd really rate it somewhere in between."
4,One of our kids' favorites!,"As you can hear from the samples, this CD is perfect for 2 to 4 year olds. There are some surprisingly snappy tunes on this CD. A great bargain!"
3,What a waste...,A movie within a movie. The characters go on to frame each other when a starlet gets murdered. I bought this movie thinking that I would see a lot of its star India Allen. She goes on naked briefly and gets layed only once.
1,Defective ballast,I bought 2 of these at Home Depot. The ballast on one went bad very quickly. I can't find a replacement.
1,Don't waste your money,Says it has a pull chain/rope....it does not. I returned it the same day I received it and went to Lowes and bought the one I really wanted for less money.
3,Slight mistake,"The light may be fine. I will never know. I assumed from the picture that it was a flush mount. I was wrong. On arrival, I note that the package says ""do not flush mount"", No hassle refund from the company."
3,A CHINESE MASTERPIECE,"This book is a tragic story of a neglected daughter of asia who has suffered the pain of so many other unwanted children.The difference between her and other neglected children,is she has the quality to write about her unfortunate upbringing. This book is a wonderful follow-up to Falling Leaves which was her first book. This book is more intended for children and uses simple language.It tells a story of a tragic childhood which nearly wasted a wonderful gifted child. Luckily Adeline had the strength and courage to stand up and deliver two wonderful CHINESE MASTERPIECES. SHe gave hope to all those other neglected children out there."
5,A great book!,"These book is one of my favorite books. It's not some fake cinderalla story, it's real. The book is inspireing to listen to your heart and but always be afraid of what the results are gonna be. It might be good or bad but usually good."
5,"Heartwrenching, enspiring tale of a young girl who was neglected.","I couldn't put this book down, being 1/2 chinese myself I loved the historical comments found in this book and could relate to some of the coldness shown to her by her family. Favortism runs deep in this book as it does in alot of chinese families as well as american families. I felt sad while reading this book yet her strength and determination was inspiring and so powerful throughout this whole story. A great story for all to read."
5,Review for Chinese Cinderella...,"I think this book is a touching autobiography about Adeline Yen Mah's life. Though sad it holds a lot of hope. To me it seems as if you are standing right next to Adeline, a spectator of her rather unhappy story, who can feel all that is happening. If,like me,you are half/fully chinese or an orphan then maybe you can relate to this wonderful book. I fully reccomend it..."
5,perfect timing,bought this book for my daughter for summer reading assignment. the retail chain near me said it would take a few weeks but i bought the book for a great price and received it within a few days with no hitches thanks amazon!
4,Chinese Cinderella- One reader's review,I enjoyed this book from the point of view that the author was incredibly brave to be able to write such obviously painful and poignant memories of her childhood. It also provided an interesting insight into life for children in China.Chinese Cinderella would perhaps best be described as in it's title as the story of an unwanted daughter- although it is also a story of how a strong woman fought everything that tried to hurt her and ruin her life. Definitely inspirational for anyone in similar circumstances.I would recommend this review to anyone interested in reading a straight from the heart piece of literature.
5,Oh...my...GOSH!!,"As I read this book, one song kept on running through my head: Because of You by Kelly Clarkson. The true story of a young girl's thriving through years of neglect, abuse, and suffering made me cry. The way it's written just pulls you in from the start. Instantly mde my top 5."
3,"now, I know how lucky I am","Tremendous effort for the author who had just penned her first book. I just couldn't help feeling for her for the hardship that she had gone through. Just hope that after finished with her work, she finally laid her past to rest & found the inner peace that she's looking for. Having said that, I still couldn't comprehend her action of writing her second novel, Chinese Cinderella which dwelled on the same thing. The author shouldn't waste the talent that's within her & she should carry on writing other interesting stories that we readers are looking forward to oblige her by buying & reading the books."
3,chinese perspective.,"This book was well written. but not so as many people would say. To understand my meaning you need to look at this in a chinese perspective. In china at the time girls were of no use to a family. girls would be married and take their husbands name. this was true especially is your birth had killed your mother. The step mother Niang, had every right in chinese perspective to do every single thing that she did. the same goes to her father. The children of Niang would of course have a better life. this is just chinese tradition. the author of this book should not have critizied the stepmother and father as she did. Also, boarding schools were only for the rich and were very expensive. for her father to have sent her to one is actually a sort of honor. I did feel alot of pity for her when i first read this book then thought about it and realized the above. over all though it is well written and very touching for such a small little girl to have lived through her life like she did."
3,predictable and whiny,"Familiar story of Chinese hating their own family members. I have read several of these kind of books, and this is the most boring one."
2,Not thrilled,Interesting read but written on a 7th grade level. Sad story. Child abuse is everywhere. Book club read so I didn't have a choice. Probably wouldn't not have read the book otherwise. Possibly a good read for teenagers!!!
1,None,As I read tis book with my english group in year 8 I felt as if just hears that someone died. This opened my eyes and let me see how the world is. I loved this book and at the same time I felt so sad and frustrated that I felt sick and cried. As a 13 year old recomend that you read it and write a review about how you felt...Regards Melita...
1,Chinese Cinderella,"""My face was probably smeared with a mixture of blood, mucus and tears. I stood in front of my classmates. I felt naked and ghastly. I had been so careful to pretend that I came from a loving family.""Chinese Cinderella is an extremely sad story written by Adeline Yen Mah. This book tells the story of Adeline, a young girl with talent who is hated by her family. It takes place in China during the 1940s when the communist are starting to take over. Adeline only has a few friends because of the hatred that is going on between her and many of her family members. Her best friend is her own aunt Baba. If you enjoy extremely depressing books then this book is for you, otherwise do not even pick up this book!!!!Warning!This book increases depression by 20% while reading!"
5,Highly recommended autobiography,"Chinese Cinderella is a heart-wrenching and sorrowful tale of a young girl growing up in a classic Cinderella setting. Treated harshly by her step-mother and ignored by her father, Adeline's life seems doomed to perpetual sadness. Every time something arrives to lighten up her life, it is taken away from her. She has to deal with loneliness and despair, but throughout the story she never gives up hope, that someday, somehow, things will get better."
4,Chinese Cinderella,"This is a great book. It took me awhile to read because there was so much description, I could picture everything. I recommend this book to 10-and higher. Some parts are very touching, and some parts are mordifying. Overall it was a great book. I recommend thsi book to many!God Bless"
4,Touching Story About A Young Girl,"This is passionate book about a young girl who struggles through childhood. Adeline Yen Mah's childhood is far beyond happy. Two weeks after her mother gives birth to her, she dies. Family members blame her as her mother's murderer. Her siblings, father, and step mother mistreats her. Her siblings play cruel pranks her, her father forgets her exits at time goes by, her step mother treats her cruelly. She strives for attention, but her family refuses to give her what she wants. She studies hard in an attempt to grab her father's attention. When she does, her step mother and siblings destroys her happiness by calling her a show off."
5,Really like this.......,"Really like this.......OXO Good Grips Nylon Flexible Turner, Tomato...they work great and also come in black perfect for eggs does not scratch and reasonably price....I would buy again!~"
2,Ugh...Hmmm...,"Well, I had high hopes for this one but my dreams don't seem to be coming true. First use and this one warped and the edges became rough. I had bought this one for flipping eggs and it seems it can't even handle medium heat on a stainless steel pan. It does look nice though, so if you're a form over function type of person this might be a best buy for you."
4,Love Mine,"I love mine. Although flexible, they are super sturdy. They work great with pancakes, eggs, etc and wash wonderfully! I am very pleased with this turner!"
4,Add flair to your kitchen,"This product replaced my favorite $.99 spatula (it had a little bbq accident). I generally feel that all spatulas are basically created equal when it comes to expensive vs. cheap. This one was $4.99 and has performed much better than manyh of the more expensive ones that I have owned. The spatuala is very sturdy and lifts eggs nicely without worrying about your good pans. Its good to remember that your turners are only as good as the pans you are cooking in. I'd give this a 5, but I was hoping for a bit more bend in the turner. I would purchase this one again."
3,NYLON FLEXILBE TURNER,THIS ITEM DIDN'T WASH WELL IN THE DISHWAHSER. THE NYLON PART WARPED FROM THE WASH CYCLE.
4,Has worked very well for me...,"I realize some other reviewers have had problems, but I haven't. This is my go-to turner, and it has held up very well. Strong enough for weighty items, but thin enough to easily slip under pretty much anything. The nylon has served me well with my non-stick pans."
3,Works,This is just another spatula - there is nothing to say about it to make it special. I like the green color but it's also odd.
4,Good Flipper!,This is nice and soft so it won't scratch your pans but the tip is a little floppy. But still I am happy I bought it.
5,surprisingly flexible,"I was a little put off at first by how flexible this turner is, but discovered that I can use it at different angles when I need to move something heftier."
3,hard to clean,"I wasn't happy with this, mostly because it is hard to clean. Cooking eggs you have to clean it right away or it will get really adhered to the nylon and difficult to get off.It's also very hard, I didn't find it flexible enough.I got the silicon variety, almost the same thing but a different material and love that one."
4,awsome.....,I love this...will probubly order another. I recomend this turner!I will get one for my mom too...it is a must have.
5,Just the Right Size,This is a great little spatula to use with the little skillet. I love it. It travels easily too if you are taking your little skillet with you.
4,Great if You are Cooking Lighter Things,"As some people have stated, this is a somewhat flimsy spatula. Not cheap or bad quality, just thinner material. It is great when I use it with something like eggs, but when cooking heavier things, it bends quite easily and is not as effective.I was hoping, as several people have said, that it would harden after use and washing, but mine has not done so yet.Overall, it's a quality product and the size and thinness are nice, as it gets under food easily and doesn't melt or burn. Cleanup is a breeze as well. Even stickier foods just wash right off."
5,Like the this turner,I really like the thiness of the turner. Just don't leave it sitting in the hot skillet as I did I left ....luckily I turned around just in time to stop it from completely melting. I was able to mold it back in to shape.
1,Disappointed...really disappointed.,"I am really disappointed by this Oxo turner. I used it for the first time to make pancakes on a non-stick skillet. Upon first contact with the pan, the edge blistered and frayed. I doubt the pan was anywhere near the max 400 degrees.Since I can't return it, I will use it for omelettes (cooked at a lower temperature than pancakes) and for transferring baking goods from baking sheets to cooling rack.I would not have spent the $7 for a single-use turner. This turner is good if you don't use it for high heat cooking."
3,the search goes on,"i was so excited but ended up being disappointed. after only a couple weeks of use, the spatula curls up. i know none of the plastic is melting into my food, but it's irritating to have it curl when it should be straight. It also would be nice if the spatula was just slightly thicker."
1,Meltdown!,"I bought this after buying an Oxo Square Turner that melted on its first use. The Square Turner was rated to 250 degrees and this to 400 degrees, so I figured I was fine. Wrong. On the second use, flipping a fried egg in a non-stick All-Clad pan, the edge melted to the pan and the eggs, created a mass of congealed plastic, egg and cheese in my (very expensive and very good) pan. And setting off a plume of caustic black smoke thick enough to trigger my smoke detector. Even if I wanted to trim the frayed plastic, the spatula was curved at such an arc as to be no longer useful. Not a useful product."
3,oxo turner,"Shipping was fast and correct but turner could be longer and not so flexibleit says dishwasher safe but came out bent it is not stiff enough to flip pancakes I think they need to redesign this. They seem to be on the right track but needs some workOXO Good Grips Nylon Flexible Turner, Black"
2,Not Up To OXO Standards,"I like the short length of this spatula. But the plastic used is too soft and flimsy, making it impossible to chop up ground beef as you're cooking it. But the fatal flaw with the plastic is that food (especially eggs) sticks to it over time, and it's impossible to get it clean. Even with a scrubby sponge, food cannot be removed. I ended up throwing mine out after 6 months. OXO - you're better than that! I love your other products - please redesign this one!"
1,Not OXO's best product,I have used OXO products for over 11 years and this is the first one I have not been happy with. Everything sticks to it and it is too flexible. I threw it away.
2,disappointed,"I love OXO utensils, and have been very happy with other silicone utensils they've made, but this one was disappointing. It's very flimsy, you couldn't begin to lift anything of any weight. Also, it stained after using it just a couple of times. Not pretty!"
1,Ineffective OXO Nylon Turner,"I recently purchased a non-stick griddle and needed to buy utensils for it. Since I have been satisfied with Oxo products in the past and needed a small turner, this one seemed a good choice. After one use, the turner lost firmness, and was no longer effective."
3,Not meant for serious use,The turner burnt the first time I used it. Could not withstand the heat of a nonstick pan. Based on other reviews I thought it would be better than other brands I bought at stores in the past. Its lightweight and cannot used to flip a large omelette/pancake.
2,Started flaking plastic bits,"I really liked this turner. It was easy to use, comfortable and initially worked well. Within a few uses, however, the plastic/nylon started flaking off the end. I bought this turner last September and by April (so about 8 months), it was flaking and I don't even cook that much. I probably used it less than 20 times before it started flaking plastic bits. And since I don't really like to eat plastic, I had to trash it. I've never had a turner go bad so fast. Sad since it's otherwise a really good product (although a bit expensive)."
2,Wishing it was more flexible...,"I was looking for a thin, flexible turner to use for delicate foods like fish. This isn't it. If you have a coated spatula for non-stick cookware, this does the same work... it is only the slightest bit flexible & no thinner. Also, the leading edge blackened after the first use. I guess my pan exceeded 400 degrees."
2,spatula,"I thought this would be a good high quality non stick thing to use while making omelettes, the eggs really stick to it, and it wasn't a breeze to clean either."
3,Turner,Just another nylon food flipper. I have many other types and they all do the same thing (turn food). Just OK
1,Cheap item,Item melted when flipping eggs. Edges got worn and very difficult to clean. Does not work like non-stick cookware that's available.
2,wilts in the heat,"LIke other OXO products, this one appears to be well-made and durable, but the technical aspects for its intended purpose are inadequate.I haven't had the disintegration, melting, and flaking problems described by others in their reviews, but the thin nylon blade wilts in contact with a hot pan and it never fully recovers. I've ended up with a turner blade that is permanently curved downward like a wilted leaf. It gets too soft when hot to be an effective turner, even for sauteed mushrooms. Cookies would probably slip off the end while being transferred to a rack. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,too flexible,"not as good as a blue we have, too flexible. our blue one is stiffer and flips better. so sorry"
4,OXO Spatula,"I generally LOVE anything OXO, but am slightly disappointed in this one. I do like it, but am not in love with it. It bowed slightly after going through the dishwasher the first time."
2,Can't recommend this one,"I have a couple other Oxo Good Grips items that I love and I needed a new spatula, so I picked up one of these at a local grocery store. I like the design, and it's nice and thin and easy to get under food, or at least it was the first couple times I used it. That being said, it's probably okay for moving cookies off a baking sheet, but it is definitely not designed for the heat of a frying pan. I used it for flipping eggs and pancakes and the edge started to melt. I had to use a sharp knife to scrape of the rough pieces. I'll have to try the silicone version, which has a higher heat tolerance."
2,Not a good replacement for the previous OXO,"I purchased this OXO spatula to replace my previous OXO that had the solid metal blade (now sold again here on Amazon; 1071536) as the tip had started to come open after several years of hard use, thinking, that based on my experience with OXO products, if it is made by OXO, it must be well made. From the get go I was unhappy. Specifically, the plastic part of the spatula required hard scrubbing to clean it, and I found it to be hyperflexible to the point of picking up things and then dumping them, like burgers. I finally threw it out after finding, for the umpteenth time,that it still contained food material after washing it. With my old OXO, a simple rinse with a sponge with soap under hot water cleaned it thoroughly. I am happy that Amazon now has my previous style in stock again, and I will order it forthwith!"
5,Lovely!,"Great little spatula, easy to use and it's a great size for flipping large pancakes and omelets! So much more functional than normal spatulas. My boyfriend has one too and we use ours all the time!"
1,Sticky spatula,"It's great that this material won't scratch your upscale, non-stick pans, however many different types of food like to stick to this spatula! That didn't immediately strike me as a problem, but I've found that the dishwasher can't dislodge the food, either... so I end up washing it by hand. In retrospect I wish I would have bought something else."
1,COLOR CATASTROPHY,"I purchased this because the yellow to lime green color variant shown in the picture fits perfectly with my mother's kitchen. When i got it, it turned out to be a dull unicolor sage. Had i known that the picture was so inaccurate I would have chosen another color."
4,Great little spatula!,"I typically prefer hard, non-flexible spatulas (turners,) but this is a great little spatula with just enough give. It's not going to flip your heavier items due to the flexibility, but for small items (pancakes, etc.) it's great. The grip is solid and it cleans up easily. A nice little kitchen essential."
4,"Standard flipper, very thin edge, NOT bright green","Works great on eggs, edge is very thin, no signs of melting at all as of yet (I bought two and have had them for a month). I must tell you that my only reason for purchasing this particular spatula/flipper is because the picture shows it as a bright, lime/chartreuse green, which would match my kitchen. THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS AVOCADO GREEN. Very blah, dull, sickly green. Flipper works great - gross color though."
3,"OXO Good grips nylon flexible turner, Pesto",I love the color and it cleans easy without food sticking. It could be a little sturdier when turning over food.
2,Disappointed,Disappointed. Gets very flimsy when it gets hot. It was actually having a hard time flipping scrambled eggs. Threw it away.
1,Spatula Blisters With Use,"OXO has always been one of our favorite kitchen implement manufactures because of their high quality--NOT THIS PRODUCT. Incredibly, the first time this was used to make pancakes the edge of the spatula blistered and melted. We tried it on hash brown potatoes with the same result. A call to OXO customer service elicited their willingness to refund the purchase price only if we returned it--which simply isn't worth the time and trouble. Maybe it's only the blue ones this happens to? We're rethinking our opinion of OXO."
2,Not What You Would Expect,"Everything this thing touches sticks to it like glue; and it has an incurable backward bend to it that makes it difficult to maneuver in any pan you try to use it in. It's impossible to clean, too. Save your money!"
3,So-So,"The turner is just a little to flexible. Doesn't work well to break up meats for even cooking, like ground beef for sauces."
2,Flimsy,"Very flimsy, will not hold an egg without bending double, egg slides right off. The handle and metal prongs are very sturdy,but doesn't help for flipping or turning. BE CAREFUL YOU DO NOT GET BURNED.Iris"
1,Useless,"I was so excited when I received this turner in the mail. I have bought so many crap turners in the past and I was hoping this one was going to be a change of pace for me. Others have had flimsy handles that couldn't bare the weight of an omelette, some couldn't stand the heat, others scratched my cookware. This one couldn't get under a soft cookie on the pan because the edges of the turner are too soft. This one couldn't flip a 2 egg cheese omelette because the turner is too flimsy. This one couldn't flip a sunny side up egg because it warped in the hot pan oil. I can't find a use for this turner. It's garbage. I'm disappointed."
3,food sticks and hard to wash,"I recently bought this to update my selection of older black plastic spatulas or turners, as they call them here.This one had the food stick to it and required quite vigorous cleaning. The next time I used it, I had the same result. I should have purchased a silicone turner because this thing is just irritating."
3,"Handy and great for many cooking tasks, but . . .",". . . it failed the ultimate test--turning over an egg for an ""easy over"" presentation. In fact, I haven't messed up a fried egg so badly since I was a young bride--and that's a long time ago! It did well with other tasks such as pancakes, burgers, fish, etc. However, the turner kept sticking when I tried to get it under the egg, which was cooked in an analon saute pan with a little oil. Ergo, a decidely not pretty egg to see on your plate. I find that the thinnest and smoothest turners work the best with delicate eggs. I won't be using this turner to lift cookies off the cookie sheet either!"
3,Mixed feelings,"I have very mixed feelings about this purchase. I love the actual turner; it's lightweight and works very well. However, I'm finding that only after a handful of uses, it's starting to get a bit mottled on the end. I've seen this happen with cheap, throw-away turners, but was surprised by this one. It's still being used, but I'm wondering how long it will last."
3,Not heat resistant,"Sadly, when I tried to flip my omlettes and other food items, the front of the ""turner"" became very flexible/flimsy and didn't allow me to pick up the omlette. It needs to be more sturdy/thicker/stronger in the front where the turner is the thinnest. Other then that, the design is fine but can't withstand the heat."
3,Good for low temp cooking,"This flexible turner is nice but don't use it for high temp cooking. I was making something (I forgot what) in a saute pan and used this turner to move the ingredients around so they wouldn't stick or burn. When I took the turner out, I noticed the bottom edge was starting to melt. I used another OXO turner (not flexible, more heavy duty) to complete the job. I can't use the turner to make pancakes now, since it cuts up the pancake when I try to slide it under. Still works well for eggs though."
3,Flexible?,I bought this for eggs as I tend to break yolks. I thought it was soft and kind of floppy. Just stiff enough to hold the egg and flip it. It's not. It's just as stiff as a regular spatula just really thin. It works well for other stuff and seems to be good quality but flexible it isn't.
3,blade bent with first use,The first time I used this turner was for cooking hash browns in my new electric skillet. The temp was set on 350. The blade on the turner permanently bent downwards after just one use. Maybe this is normal. This is a very nice turner but I wonder how it will hold up over time.
5,Great spatula,"I bought this for my husband to use and he loves it. It's very thin and flexible and easy to use in all my pans, even when food is at the very edge of the pan."
3,An average turner,I liked everything about this turner except the handle melts easily if it touches a hot pan rim.
2,Bends too easily and doesn't tolerate heat well.,"I am not a big fan of this turner. It bends very easily, especially when it's a little heated. So forget about using it to turn something heavier than a silver dollar pancake. I can't even fold omelet with it. The edge also melts, not from being left in a pan but from being used to flip crepes, etc.. I regret this purchase. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it has a relatively thin edge which makes it easy to slide this thing under a pancake."
3,Remember these tunes?,"Worth having in your collection for The Humpty Dance and Doowutchyalike alone, which never fail to please audiences from 4 to 64 when played in the car or at parties. Not all the songs are up to that level, though. Sex Packets is probably the one to get; the short version of Doowutchyalike here really bugs me."
4,A must for fans!,"This CD is a compilation of the best that is DU. It takes you back to the time and place where you first listened this this funky, fun music."
2,harman kardon,"These speakers look great but they have very weak lows and no mids. However, the highs are very clear."
1,THEY MAY BE CUTE- - - BUT,"THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM MAY BE CUTE AND CARRY A TOP END PRICE BUT I FOUND THEM TO BE TRULEY LACKING IN PERFORMANCE.THE SUB ADDS VERY LITTLE BASS THAT YOU WOULD NOTICE AND THE VOICE TRACKS ON ALL THE CDS I TRIED WERE SO FAR IN THE REAR THEY WERE BARELY AUDIBLE.IF YOU WANT CUTE,BUY THESE.IF YOU WANT PERFORMANCE KEEP LOOKING."
1,Please don't buy these,"I ordered these as optional speakers with my new Dell computer. They worked fine for 1 yr and almost 5 months. Then for some reason I have yet to determine, they started blowing the fuse. The sound quality I thought (for music) was average at best. I just think that with a name like HK on them they should have lasted a lifetime and not barely past the warranty period. Don't buy them!"
2,Please take my advice on this.,"I have done tonnes of research on picking out the best deals and best quality products for years now. I can tell you for a fact that these speakers are not worth 100 bux. It's sad to see that these are being sold at such a high price, and people still buy them.I have had these speakers for more than a year now. They came with my DELL system. Now I am not saying these are bad speakers, but I wouldn't value them at anything higher than $50, on the high high end.The thing people don't understand well, is that speakers are speakers. These one's look ok, but they fall over sometimes, and the volume control and placement of the two satellites can be annoying. (I am being particular for a reason, not trying to dissapoint those who already have them). I enjoy the pair that I have, they do the job, they make some noise. They are a good pair of speakers if you ask me. But for $100, do yourself a favor and get the ""Logitech Z-2300 2.1 THX-Certified 200-Watt Speaker System""."
2,"Overpriced, Underperforming",I bought the Champagne speakers and found that the sound is not as good as my $50 Yamaha speakers. This sound is not especially sharp or clear and there is a faint muffled noise in the background.
2,BAD,"Just to start off, it is impossible to even get any good sound out of these speakers. I got these with the dell, and they have nice sound, but the volume is really bad. The volume control is in a bad spot (ON TOP OF THE RIGHT SATTELITE) really annoying. Also, you can get much better sound out of the JBL creature speakers, JBL invaders, and the JBL soundsticks. All of the JBLs sound better and look much better with an apple. These speakers are made to look good with PCs which they do, but NOT AN iBook!!!!! They sound okay, don't look great, for speakers they are just mediocre."
1,Double Check the DVD format!!!,"When I bought this I saw ""Region Free"" so I got it. Now that its here, it won't play because its ""Region Free"" in PAL format. So I was a little decieved by the product description. So If anyone in Europe wants to buy this, I have a copy.The only thing that plays is, Disc 2 on a computer, because it is the ""DVD ROM""I mean really, why are CDs able to be played no matter where they were made, but DVDs have to have the Regions.Now I have to order another one. Now I see why the first was cheaper..."
5,No Remorse for this Buyer,"This was a great purchase. If you've ever been to a live Motorhead performance, you know that the sound mix can be a wall of mud. Not so here in this DVD live performance. Lemmy and Co. clearly spent a lot of loot on getting the sound spot on, and the camera work and lighting are great. The lighting is special-occasion caliber, not their standard-issue stuff, and really adds to the show's excitement, since this trio is a stand-there-and-play sort. On the Special Content disc, the best part as mentioned by other reviewers is the interview with Richie, the Cook. No danger whatsoever of this band becoming a gray corporation! I sit and play my guitar along with the DVD, and it's a real kick."
3,editing crime....,great music and performance. this dvd is ruined and rendering virtually useless (except for the music itself) by the horrible editing. everything is way too fast. i don't know what they could have been thinking. motorhead was done a serious diservice by the dvd's producers.
3,horrible camera work,Motorhead sounds great on this DVD but the camera just doesn't stop to let you breathe. On almost every song the camera literally moves every second to the point I started trying to count the seconds when the camera stood still and didn't cut from the drummer/to the crowd/to Lemmy/back to the crowd/back to the drummer---and I never got to two seconds. The music is fast and crazy enough that the camera pace was just too much--and I love Motorhead. 5 stars for the sound and 1 star for the camera work. Can't believe one reviewer actually said the exact opposite.
1,"Stage Fright HD DVD, Motorhead","This is not a review of the product but a complaint about the company that I bought it from by the name of rannie rocks. I did not notice that they had a HD in the list of the DVD's. I was buying it for my son for a birhday present and was not familiar with the fact that HD's could not be played on most players and that they had gone out of use for the most part.I sent it back with a nice letter to see if I could work something out with a regular DVD, but my package which was addressed to the address on their shipment was returned by the post office with the message that no such company was at that address.William H. McRae"
5,motorhead mayhem .....,"This is the one.No gimmicks,no smoke and mirrors just a wall of unremitting sound and lemmys rasping vocals no doubt well lubricated by a generous measure of jack daniels.The set includes most of the classic tracks and a couple of songs from the 2004 album ""inferno"".The number ""all in the name of tragedy"" is as good as anything they have produced.In celebration of their thirtieth year, this band no what it takes to move a crowd.Played in Dusseldorf, lemmy wearing his iron cross obviously feels at home and the germans certainly appreciate the finer points of decibal devastation.If you are aware of motorheads prowess then this dvd is a must buy.Good time guaranteed. ps. Wear the headphones or wait until the neighbours are out."
5,After this #1 Motorhead fan..,"Trully HD, sound and songs blasting, first time I buy anything from Motorhead and now I have become a loyal fan. Haven't seen the extras buy who cares, I just got metallized with the concert and great production that was developed for this product."
1,Very disappointed,"We just attended a live concert of Mannheim Steamroller performing ""Celebration"". It was wonderful, and we hoped to relive the memory through a DVD. This should be listed as a CD, because it is not a video of their concert. Very misleading!"
5,WOW! What extremely sad reviews :(,"I do not own this product yet but I will soon. While it is true that about 98% of DVDs are used for movies there is the DVD audio standard. The main reason for this review is to define DVD. So DVD stands for (D)igital (V)ersitile (D)isc, not Digital Video Disc. I shall update this reivew when I purchase this DVD a little later :)"
2,Greatest Hits CD,"I love Mannheim Steamroller. I like their Christmas Music. However, I should have read the playlist before buying because this is a Greatest Hits album even though they don't say so. Which means most of the pieces are taken from other albums which I already own. I didn't care for the one or two remixes myself, so as far as I was concerned I wasted my money. A greatest hits album is however a great way to get aquainted with an artist.Me, I bought it as a CD, don't know about it being mistakenly marketed as a DVD."
1,"Music only DVD, no video","When I think of a DVD, I think of video. The writeup on this item does not specify that it is a music DVD. I was looking for a video of Mannheim Steamroller Christmas music for the wife after going to see them last week in Orlando. We already have the CD so this is a waste, will be returning it. Wish I could give it 0 stars due to the misleading/incomplete listing."
1,DISAPPOINTING!,"This DVD was the biggest disappointment. When I think of a DVD I think of videos! But all you see is a picture of the cover and the name of the song down in the corner. Hardly my idea of a video. Mannheim Steamroller makes such wonderful Christmas music, I love them. I got so excited when I saw this DVD, I thought of their first VHS video ""A Fresh Aire Christmas"" that was Great just to short! If you have the CD don't bother buying it like I did, what a waste of money!"
1,Manufacturers Defect,I will never buy a JVC product again! My VCR quit working one day while not even turned on and JVC service wanted to charge me a $40 diagnostic fee plus another $135 to fix the problem. The units are defective due to excessive integrated circuit heat which causes stress failure in the control module. It has nothing to do with power surge failure as is evidenced by the internal fuse which stays intact. JVC engineering has done a great job creating defective products which they will not back. My advice: no matter how cheap they get - spend your money on another brand!
3,citizen watch,Came in a mannerly time... Still haven't worn it yet because it's too big and didn't want to take a chance ruining it.
4,International Education and Cross Cultural exchange,This book will be of interest to former Fulbright exchange scholars in particular and to those interested in international education and cross cultural exchange more generally.
4,"A Complex, Dark, Disturbing Masterpiece!","This book is disturbing yes, but brilliant and captivating at the same time. I am a fan of Welsh's writing and am accustomed to the darkness present in his novels. This book, however, was the darkest of them all. The main character is deeply troubled and prefers the nightmares of his own imagination than the nightmares of the reality he has lived through. As he is on the verge of awaking from his comatose state he fights to go deeper into his coma to avoid facing real life. I confess to being disturbed and a bit depressed by this book but the concept was so brilliant and geniusly executed as only Irvine Welsh can. I recommend this book to anyone who can think beyond two dimentions. It is a complex, dark, disturbing masterpiece!"
5,Strang(e),"Some people write, other people try to write, Mr. Welsh creates a fantastic world. You never know what to expect next. Between learning a new language, and getting a new glimpse of life, Chasing the stork, or learing about Roys past. You never know what lurks around that next corner. Welsh gives something to the 20 somethingers of English the language that should never leave their sides, it should travel with them everywhere. Read it once, read it twice, read it until it falls apart and then by another one, Simply amazing"
5,"different, but better than Trainspotting","When I put this book down, I knew that I had just read something special. While it is different than Trainspotting, the humor is funnier and the drama is much more disturbing. For any fan of Welsh, to say that this book is a must read puts it lightly."
5,Classics!<~~~by Ambitranceboy@Yahoo!chats,"Well, the book is a classical example of eternal question ""Who am I?"" written in a new rave style, nice technique, cheesy images, great style! Reminds me ""Master of flies"", ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", also transcedentalism and non-conforming phylosophies. But make sure your conclusion is right!!! There is never an ascuse for a wrong one!!! Read more!"
4,A great read,"Sad sad Roy Strang. Messed up family,messed up life, messed up ....dog? The format in which Welsh wrote in was abit difficult to follow for a couple of pages, but I realized at the end that he pulled it off really well. Not a fantasy story...more along the lines of ""this is my bloody life, the Marabou stork nightmares"". Cheers"
2,"Unfortunately, expecations not met","The Sandelli - 14k Gold Onyx with tigers-Eye Drop earrings were too loose for my ear and I lost one of the earrings. As a jewelry maker I know when I'm making a set of earrings, the fish hook have the tendency to slip out of the ear. And should have included the little rubber stoppers with their product. It's a smaill thing to build customer relations and loyalty. I even called and spoke to someone in the store asking to buy one earring if they had such a thing. I was reassured they did have extras earrings and would send me out one. Well I'm still waiting and it's been 3 years. Buyer Beware!!!"
4,This book shows us just how important economics is to us all,"Whether a student, fan, or stranger to Dr. Friedman, we are all left to give him praise for his enlightening work. After completion of this book, the reader understands just how strongly our daily lives are governed by economics. Whether it be buying a used car, getting married, or voting, this book teaches us that we can not make a single decision in life without resorting to economic thought. As a student of Dr. Friedman, Hidden Order served to me as a great tool for understanding his way of thought and opened my mind to the practical applications of economics. Just as well, to a stranger of Dr. Friedman, this book will serve a full plate of refreshing thoughts. I would recommend this book to fellow economists as well as to anyone who has never even taken an economics class."
3,Okay book,"This is a decent book but it's problem is that it is not intended towards a particular audience. Readers familiar with economics will find the theoretical parts of the book to be obvious. I suspect readers not familiar with economics will become bored by the graphs and theory. This book has some fascinating moments for sure, but I wish he focused more on the applications of his logic than the logic itself.I'd highly recommend one of Friedman's other books, The Machinery of Freedom, along with his blog, however."
1,Boring,I loved Freakonomics and expected it to be the same. I liked it much less and found it extremely difficult to get through.
1,Terrible Book,"Sorry for being so negative about it, found it clumsily written with childish logic... waste of time"
4,A good reference book,"This would be a good book for someone looking for basic information. Its not a book on techniques or special mediums, but instead a book that answers alot of technical questions. A step up from Mayer's book. The Oil painting section is very brief in the area of painting techniques, but has several charts for reference on binders, pigments and drying times."
4,"Didn't hurt, but didn't help","I had hoped this would save a problem with horizontal black-line video noise in high-contrast areas. Unfortunately, it did not."
3,Not bad,"The sound and image quality is good, despite it was a refurbished item.I had a two little dissapointing surprises: at first glance, I noticed in the front of the tv a large scratch that is annoying; later, I found that new sets like this one where being sold at Sears for the same price .."
2,a Big Let Down!!!,"If your a ""EWF"", Tori fan or not this is a let down. Here in my head I just cant beleive that I paid money for this. Im a true Tori fan and have been working on a full collection for years, us uk and imports so i felt the need to add it to the collection. Dont make the same mistake it is not one of her best remixes and am sure that all it will do is sit on my bookstand. Save your money and buy some other Tori. Youll be much happier"
3,Nice Study Guide,"This looks like a great study guide, but you need to video series to go along with it. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought it separately."
5,Cave Poetry And Cave Art For Your Favorite Troglotyke,"I love Diane Siebert's poetic picture books. Her poetry is always fun to read, her content is always accurate, and she always has the best illustrators working with her. Cave may be her best book yet. Any child hearing or reading this extended poem will learn about limestone caves from the formation of the original layer of limestone to the actions of humans on the caves [both beautiful (neolithic cave paintings) and destructive (the destruction and removal of cave formations)]. The book contains the fun kinds of multisyllabic words that kids like to learn and say - words like stalactite, stalagmite, and troglophiles - and includes a pronunciation guide at the end of the book. The book includes an author's note at the end that provides a little more background for the adult reader. I highly recommend that you get a copy of this wonderful picture book for your favorite young reader."
5,At last the other side of Cuban music,"La música cubana, a pesar de ser una de las más prolíficas y variadas del mundo, suele encasillarse siempre: o bien música para bailar, o bien música para la nostalgia de los que no concen profundamente Cuba. Este disco es un buen ejemplo de lo compleja y sofisticada que puede ser la música cubana, y de una de sus principales virtudes, la apropiación inteligente de todas las demás músicas. Yusa es una gran artista, una virtuosa y sus canciones son de una elegancia increíble, sin dejar de sonar cubana."
1,Horrible !,"Not sure what the other reviewers are refering to...maybe they heard a different album than i did. Yusa may have great lyrics, but her voice and the music don't match. The best way to describe this album = like having Rush Limbaugh in one radio, while another is playing Mambo !...This was a HORRIBLE acquisition to my CD collection. I recommend that those interested listen to the clips and decide whether this is the sort of music they enjoy; if that's the case...more power to them...I, instead, elected to use the CD as a drink coaster."
3,"Good, but irritating","While I enjoy and have used much of the information in this book, my big gripe is that the index is done terribly. It seems like they just copied the indexes from the three books instead of re-doing them, so nothing is listed under the proper page number. It makes trying to find anything a nightmare."
4,developing a mindset,"Amy Dacyczyn's TIGHTWAD GAZETTE series list 100's of ways to save money on meals and on the cost of living in general. Some of her ideas--canning or making homemade yogurt, for example--may not appeal to everyone, but the value of Dacyczyn's books is that they can help one to develop a frugal mindset, one where you are on the lookout for less expensive alternatives to your usual way of doing things.To her critics, Amy writes that it is incorrect to assume that all people should be frugal in the same way, and she says that there are many legit ways to be frugal. The key is why? What is your goal? The answer will determine how you adapt the principles described in the books to your own situation."
5,Ms. Dacyczyn is a Modern Day Prophet!,"The ONLY negative thing I can say about this tremendously enlightening book is that it was harder to find as a result of the author's ultra-complicated last name! Aside from that, it is fascinating in both economic AND lifestyle terms, as it truly IS an alternative lifestyle, as Amy Herself puts it on the book's cover. A whole new world opened up for me- a world of options and choices I never dreamed I had available to me! Amy Dacyczyn is one of the smartest, shrewdist, and most rational people on the planet. I just love her!"
4,Great ideas/Index needs work,"This is the gold standard for any and all books/compendiums/guides on how to live well on less money with more fun. It just doesn't get any better than this. My only hesitation (hence the four stars instead of five) is that the index needs further work as it is no where near comprehensive enough to use this book as it should be used: which is as a reference tool that one goes back to time and time again to find the information at the time one wishes to apply it. While the index presently is adequate, barely, it just isn't up to what should be here. Still well, well worth the money and the reading."
3,Magnifisoso,"Magnifisoso is a word our daughter made up when she was 10. It means that something is mediocre. This book is magnifisoso.The book does have some interesting and valid ways to stretch a dollar, but it also has crafts and such that are pretty uninspiring as well."
3,How much are you willing to sacrifice ??,"This book has a lot of good and practical ideas on how to save money, reuse things, get things for free. It all comes down to how much someone is willing to sacrifice in order to save a few dollars. I couldn't believe it when I read that Amy Dacyczyn doesn't bathe her children daily but ""as needed"" and minimun ONCE A WEEK!! Is compromising hygene standards a good way to save money or time?"
1,Some ideas were just too far-fetched,"I had no problem with the term Tightwad, and there were some good ideas, but some bordered on ridiculous. Dumpster Diving, IMHO, is NOT the way I want to get canned veggies or pet food. I am also not planning to remodel my house with items scrounged from the local dump area. And I could imagine the reaction I'd get if I asked my neighbors to all send in our gas bills in the same envelope so we could save .34 postage. If you have a hard time putting food on your table (then how could you afford to browse Amazon, online, looking to buy a book?) this would be your book. But if you are looking for ways to save money and cut wasteful spending, I'd suggest Miserly Moms before this."
2,Too extreme and too narrow,"Some of the suggestions in this book are good. Indeed it's funny how much of it my wife and I already implement. However, the scrimping is overdone. For example, my wife and I catered our own wedding and saved a bundle. However, we would never have dreamed of having a pot luck wedding!I prefer Andrew Tobias' approach, which is more balanced. He both scrimps and invests. With six kids you could argue that Amy is not doing the Earth any favors. No doubt it's hard to have six kids and any money left to save no matter how frugal you are.A healthy balance is sadly lacking here."
2,TIGHTWAD ABSURDITY,"You can save money, but most of these suggestions are worthless...like something you dream up to fill up a book. I wonder if the next one is save dental floss, you can reuse it 800 times. I doubt if normal sane people will go for the absurd suggestions here in this book. This is taking cheapness to a ridiculous level that is not normal."
1,"Outdated, irrelevant, and time consuming","Living frugally while raising a family and sending my husband to college full time while living on one income in Los Angeles is no easy task. This book was a waste of my time. It includes ways to make your typewriter tape last longer and how to save on encyclopedia sets. If saving time is as important to you as saving money, then this book is not for you. If you are searching for the book used here on Amazon.com, then you are already ahead of the game."
3,Somewhat over the top...,"I am a credit counselor/budget counselor and wanted to get some ideas on how to cut back and save money for myself and give some ideas to my clients. After getting the book there are a FEW great ideas but mostly its just over the top. If you have A LOT of time on your hands with no kids then go for it. Honestly I think it is cheaper to buy things that are ""more expensive"" than to do all the work to save money...time is money!!!!"
2,Attitude spoils the content,"I am a schoolteacher -- and most of us are not known to be millionaires. I found a lot of good ideas in the TIGHTWAD GAZETTE, but I don't like guilt trips (shame, shame shame if you use disposable diapers) (shame shame shame if you want two incomes in the family). There are other books on the market that promote thrift and frugal living and they are a joy to read and make the reader feel good as opposed to foolish."
5,GREAT,"GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER, FORGET WHAT SOCIETY SAYS-BE YOUR OWN PERSON/FAMILY, AND CONSERVE MONEY AND RESOURCES!"
5,10 frugal thumbs up!!!,"This is one of my favorite books and something that will be read over and over again. The Complete Tightwad Gazette is an incredible resource for the frugal minded and those who are not so frugal minded as well! She suggests amazing ideas to cut back on costs, while still living a full life. What this book does is not just tighten the shoestrings, but it allow your shoes to take you more places without having to spend more!! It widens the possibilities and opportunities a person/family can have without breaking the bank."
5,The Complete Tighwad Gazette,"I highly recommend this book. It has many wonderful ideas for saving money, and it's fun to read. Shipping service was great. Thank you."
5,One of Five books that changed my life,"So, you ask... how do I spend less money so I can create wealth? This book is the bible on crazy and not so crazy ways people spend less cash. A collection of newsletters and correspondence, ""The Tightwad Gazette"" is a wealth of ideas on how you can make small and large changes to you lifestyle to not only save your hard earned bucks but to live lighter on the earth. Buy in bulk when on sale, go to garage sales, use cloth napkins, calculate and compare the per unit cost, and tons... and I mean TONS of ideas on living frugal. This book made me realize that if I am ever in a tight spot, I can cut all kinds of expenses. Seeing what these people are willing to do... wow... I have no excuse for not saving money every day. By the way, I make my own laundry detergent now (cost about 3cents a load compared to Tide at 25cents). Feel free to hit me up for the recipe."
5,The Complete Tightwad Gazette,This large collection is uniquely presented and is entertaining while offering loads and loads of helpful tips. There is something for everyone within the covers.
5,pays for itself,"This is a compilation of 3 books & additional $ saving tips, helps you change the way you use every cent you think you have to spend.She finds money where you have none,could not live without this.Best book out there on thrift.Indexed by topic,easy to implement small or big changes.I am renovating a house based on the money she finds in the little things."
1,Not for me,"As much as I'd like to not have to work, I'd rather work then spend my day cooking from scratch (I hate cooking!), rewashing baggies or shopping at thrift stores for deals. I only got a quarter way through this book, but I didn't find it helpful to me. The only thing I agreed about was the price diary, which I knew about before. I also didn't like that she seemed to put down people who wouldn't do these things, like we're a bunch of fools for buying new baggies or pre-packaged convience food.I'm sure her ideas work if you're willing to put in the time and effort, but they just aren't for me."
3,"Enjoyable to read, but that's all.","I think the book was quite goodand put together well, however any mother tight on finances would most likely know many of the tips and hints automatically, like cloth diapers and rubber pants. Buying rubber pants at thrift stores is nothing new for my daughters did that with their own children."
1,She's got a farmhouse with abarn you know.,"I really did not like this book.I got sick of reading about the farmhouse and barn (you only have to mention it once).I don't know why she had six children if she can't feed them,maybe she had them to fill up her barn.I agree with another reviewer who said she is giving her kids the idea that they are not worth it.It's ok for kids to have second hand clothes and toys but it's also nice for them to have new stuff to (she could buy things in the sales).She has no balance.There are better books out there to save money I say buy one of them instead."
3,Good for families needing to make drastic changes,"I heard such fantastic things about the Tightwad Gazette that I couldn't wait for my copy to come in the mail. I was a bit disappointed. If I had a family and needed to drastically reduce my spending it would be very useful. But, as a single woman I felt that the book had less to offer me. Also, I wasn't looking to drastically change my lifestyle. Amy's suggestions include using an old tuna can and shaping it into a cookie cutter (This would be useful for families with small children, but I don't really make a lot of cookies).Also, the book does not seem to have a contents or an index. This made it even more difficult for me to find information that was appropriate for my lifestyle.I would highly recommend this book to families with children who need to save a lot of money. If you are just looking for a way to cut a few corners this book is probably not for you."
5,Loved this book,"I live in England and it was through American frugal websites I came across the name of this astonishing lady. I could barely contain myself when my book finally arrived and what a book!Stacks and stacks of information (a lot of it not relevant in the UK but fascinating nonetheless).I really am not sure if it is possible to live on one average wage these days with the price of property and wages so low now, however this book has masses to keep you entertained and you will certainly look at stuff with a different eye before you go buy something new. Brilliant."
2,Terrible organization,"I had a very hard time with the way this book is organized. It's NOT! It's organized by season??!! On one page there is what to do with your juice lids, the next page is budget weddings? Huh?! Would have made more sense if it was organized by actual categories-kitchen, toys, clothes, utility bills, car repairs. I thought it was more of a reference book but unless you know exactly what your're looking for and can look it up in the index it's useless. I wish I hadn't wasted the money. It's all over the place. No rhyme or reason to it at all."
1,Never received the product,I really wanted to help this student ... I assumed it was a student from the website listed. I did not receive the correct book and has to tear the book to open the package. I would LOVE to see this complete addition but the receipt and packing slip got thrown away by mistake.
3,Save yourself even more money by borrowing it from a library,"Frankly, I found Jonni McCoy's ""Miserly Moms"" and Mary Hunt's Cheapskate Monthly more useful than this. I ended up returning my copy of the Tightwad Gazette and will check it out from my local library if I want to look for cost savings in specific areas...I guess what it comes down to is you need to determine what is important to you and adjusting your finances accordingly...What people should do is determine their budget/spending habits, then go to a good financial advisor to determine how best to invest their money.Save yourself the money and check this book out at your local library!"
2,...or just go live under the bridge....,"I mean COME ON folks, nothing against saving money, but I guess going as far as eliminating tooth paste from the household is a kind of an extreme measure. Of course, some pieces of advice are helpful, but most are absolutely useless, if not plain stupid. The lady preaches washing dishes with an old athletic sock... Do I need to say more?..."
3,Frugal Mommie Dearest,"I'm sure I'll gain enough tips from this book to make it worth the purchase price, like the article on yogurt making. However, I found a disturbing discrepancy between the quality she was willing to accept for herself and what she'd accept for her kids. She forces her children to wear only thrift store clothes but found ways to justify new furniture for herself for aesthetic reasons. She'll buy used toys for her kiddies at Xmas, but she wouldn't buy used dining room chairs because she didn't find any that she ""liked"". Granted, the $55 she paid for each woven-seat chair was a good deal; but she was willing to pay an extra $20 per chair over the basic model and still expects the kiddies to eat bread crumb cookies. Kinda makes me wonder why she bothered having six kids - maybe just to fill up the picture-perfect 100-year-old New England farmhouse?"
2,Not worth it.,"Unless you are young and just starting out in the 'world of frugality', the book just is not worth it. Long written, short ideas."
4,interesting,"This book is certainly not for everyone and maybe a lot of people wouldn't want to do it for a long time, but I do think that the author has a point. If for a while you do live as frugally as you can, then you save your money and you will have quite a nice financial cushion.I really can't imagine dumpster diving, it sounds very disgusting. I won't go that far, and I really can't imagine being frugal forever. Some of the things the author does are a little too extreme. Life is too short and why shouldn't people buy nice things and enjoy their life? I do think that it is a good thing to be frugal especially when the expense of living is going up. It really depends on the person and how they want to be frugal, some of the advice here works for me and some of it doesn't. Overall it's a great book with great advice."
5,Penny-Pincher's Paradise,"If you truly want to save money, this book will tell you how to do it, right down to calculating the price of store-bought versus homemade."
5,The Complete Tightwad Gazette,"I have owned and used this book for a couple of years. I subscribed to the newsletter when that was being published. And with the help of all the tips, was able to pay off our debt and at the same time stay home while my husband supported the family. As for whether this is worthwhile for a family who can't put food on the table....the grocery shopping tips alone will save you enough money the first week to buy the book. And after that the money you save will go toward meeting your goals. Even if that goal is just to survive with less stress. The major thing that this book did for me was to give me real control over my situation. It gave me power and confidence. Even though I had the newsletters (I have passed those on to someone else), I bought the book so that I would have an index to all the ideas in one place. It is also easier to store than all those newsletters. I highly recommend this."
5,Save !!,"Other than the fact that Amy hates Tools.. and being a guy I love expensive computers, cameras and yes.. tools! This is a great book.Ever wonder how you can feed and cloth your pack of kids and get them all through college? Amy Dacyczyn beats the government estimates and gives you the tools to make the most out of less.This ""Complete"" Gazette is wonderfull. Amy even admits that she could continue to ""rewrite"" the same old stuff giving her a guarenteed income for life. Instead, this three volume book pretty much covers everything you need. Not only does it contain facts on saving.. she also gives you the ""Tightwad"" concepts that can be applied to running most any thrifty household.If you're struggling to make it on an income of over 50K a year you really need this book ;-)GENE"
4,Great book but needs to be updated - should expand their small online section,"This is a book full of wonderful ideas but falls short on how to save big bucks by using the Internet. Websites like Amazon and Tightwadsales offer fantastic savings on everyday items normal people purchase, especially electronics and books. Other than not having a section on saving on the Internet it's a great book."
4,Gets Your Creative Juices Flowing,"Born out of a need to generate an income while caring for her large family, Amy Dacyczyn produced newsletters full of her latest frugal adventures. This book is a compilation of those newsletters. Her illustrations are both artistic and entertaining. While you may not always agree with her conclusions (such as not selecting organic over standard produce), there's a LOT to be gained here. Amy walks you through cost analysis in a fun way to help you decide whether/how/if it is worth your while to make purchases. Her organization/storage methods are worth the cost of the book alone. Added to this are from-scratch recipes, time saving tips and ideas about how to meet needs by thinking outside the box. If there's a freebie to be had, Mrs. Dacyczyn has been there, done that and considered it's net value.You need a copy for your home and a couple of extras to give away or loan. DON'T LOAN OUT YOUR PERSONAL COPY -- you'll never see it again! :-)"
5,Full of practical advice for healthy living,"""Healthy"" meaning on all levels, not just medical.Although I no longer have to pinch pennies, I believe in using our planet's limited resources as wisely as possible and gave my brother a copy after his first child was born. He had never heard of it, and made a face and said, ""Reuse disposable diapers!"" I replied, ""It doesn't go THAT far!""He and his wife found some of the ideas a bit outrageous, as did I, but Ms. Dacyczyn herself says they are not feasible or practical for everybody. A few of the ideas are out of date nine years after its publication - like the advice on retirement plans and low-cost prescription drugs - but the concepts are still valid. It is the ONLY budget guide I've seen which can be used by people of all income levels."
3,The Tightwad Gazette,"I wish I could thank Amy in person. I was always thrifty but with her book I took it to a whole new level. She is so straightforward and sincerely trying to help others with the revelation she herself had. You have to respect her determination. I have advised no less that 25 people to read her book always joking every home should have a copy of this book in it. I have just purchased my first one as a wedding gift which I believe will become my standard. If I have helped to light a young couples path, that is a gift! If you are ready to receive the message it can change your financial future."
4,Good book,I like this book b/c it has alot of things that i can easily incorporate into my life and some that i have never thought of before. Just been jumping around in it and not really trying to read it front to back. Lots of inspiration also!
4,Many Beautiful Photographs,"This guide's best feature is the beautiful photographs. They make you want to get in your car and go! Besides pictures of landscapes, there are also pictures of wildlife, and people engaged in various activities (camping, hiking, skiing, etc.). The guide covers parks in California & the Pacific, The Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, and the Southwest. Unfortunately, the entrance costs for the parks are not given; but there are park phone numbers & addresses so you can call or write at your own convenience (or expense!) This book is written for the International traveler. It contains information about US time zones, currency, passports, etc. There are some maps included, but the traveler will probably need more detailed maps if he intends to visit these locations."
4,Locking Diary,"My 10-year-old granddaughter loved her locking diary. She loves horses, so the wild horse themed cover was perfect for her."
1,A piece of JUNK!,"My daughter (13 years old) and I were going through my closet and we ran across some of my old diaries. After that, she started expressing an interest in wanting to keep a journal/diary of her own. She loves horses so I thought this would have been perfect.When it arrived, I was not too impressed with how it looked. The picture is printed on there and looks really cheap. The colors are off and just has a really cheap look to it.The locking mechanisim is plastic so I dont see how it will hold up very long. They certainly dont make them like they used to.Also, when she opened it for the first time, the binding separated from the spine of the book. The pages held together and stayed stuck to the glue binding, thankfully, but I am worried they too will start to fall out.I am a little disappointed in how this is made. My daughter seems to like it but I have to say I was a little let down by it and am already looking for a replacement for her."
3,cute,"i read the dimensions online but in my hands, it seemed really small. but it was cute and the lock works."
4,Diary,"I purchased this item for my daughter who is now 11. She was nine when I bought this. She still writes in it sometimes, and loves the horse on the cover. We haven't had any problems with anyone getting into it, and she loves the lock and key aspect, as she's very private. Good purchase."
1,POOR QUALITY,I bought this item for my 7 year old for her birthday. Very disappointed when approximately 30 minutes after she opened her present the lock broke with no way to repair it. VERY POOR QUALITY!!
5,Sight Word Books: Reproducible Readers,"OUTSTANDING,A must have for every Kindergarten or First Grade Teacher. A practical easy to use book for student and teacher. Books that inspire children to successfully read and stimulate that love for reading."
4,Obscure funk to get you going,"Most of these tunes were funky party favorites on the east coast during the 70s, few of these made the national R&B charts during this era since Disco was ruling the roost. But even today on the East Coast, it's not unusual to hear tunes like ""Dance to the Drummer's Beat"" by Herman Kelly and Life and the one that started it all, ""King Tim III"" by the Fatback Band."
5,A Wakeup Call for Middle Managers !,"Cappelli provides an understanding of the changes in the social and psychological contracts between employees and their employers in todays world. I feel as if blinders have been removed from my eyes and that I now have the tools to understand the changing work environment and labor market of the new economy.A must read for those in large companies that have existed longer than 40 years (or are over 40 years old themselves).For for those who believe they have security and entitlement based upon their ""knowledge of the company""... Here's a News Flash "" Organizational man is dead ...""Thanks Professor for the heads up !"
2,The New Deal at Work,Not what want it. Lots of stuff is outdated and not concise either. Also the cover is too heavy and the letter are too small. all the layout are not readable.
5,True inspiration,"I truly enjoyed this inspirational CD. It has appeal for all ages and all different musical tastes. If you are looking for something to lift you up and jump start your day, this is the album for you."
3,Cd,"Wish I could have listened to this before buying. It was an ok cd, but not worth the full price. Would think twice about buying it again."
5,Ray at his best,"This CD is Brother Ray at his best. Listen to track 12 ""The Brightest Smile in Town"" and you'll be a believer too."
3,mellow,"this cd is different, easy to listen to. songs that my parent sung to me when i was growing up in a different version... 'old man river' and 'somewhere over the rainbow.' good to cook dinner to."
5,"A simple, solid controller","This is one of my favorite game console controller designs ever. The controller is simple, very lightweight, very cheaply priced, and still gets the job done. It's a solid piece of construction that fits comfortably in the hand. I actually prefer this controller over the analog controller."
1,Got a cheap knockoff!!,i ordered this controller thinking it was going to be a genuine PS One controller.i was stunned to see a cheap Naki controller. this is unacceptable! it was not stated anywhere on the item that it may be a cheap knockoff. i am very unsatisfied!
5,Complete Debussy,"These recordings are some of the highest quality Debussy you'll find. There is a freedom that comes across in Fergus-Thompson's playing that you won't find in other so-called great recordings. Instead of trying to sound ""Debussy-like"", the music is played naturally while maintaining accuracy and original intent of the composer. Recording quality is up to date. Box set is 4 discs, with the body nicely separated into larger works with dates included."
4,Enjoyable and Entertaining,"James Charles Roy describes himself as a freelance historian. Not much money to be made there, but after reading his entertaining account of leading a tour of American septugenarians into the wilds of ancient Ireland, I think the world needs more historians like him. Roy takes us into the byways and back roads of Ireland introducing us to a part of this beautiful island that most of us never see. His tales and experiences are told with a wry and self-deprecating humor which makes this a thoroughly enjoyable and quick read."
2,disappointing,"Mr. Roy's book was much anticipated, and it needn't have been. The author's self concerns are so vast there is very little room for Ireland, almost none. A few tidbits survived, that is actual tidbits about Ireland, but for the most part the book is not about Ireland, it is about Roy. I suppose he is an interesting fellow, but I did not buy a book about him, at least I had not thought so; but a book about the author's various tortured landscapes is what I got, and again, very little Ireland.Perhaps I am too harsh. But I was disappointed."
4,Good snack but...,"As another reviewer mentioned, I can't really taste the peach/mango flavor and mostly just taste the rice/corn. I expected a variety of bags in all the different fruit flavors. Instead my entire case was one flavor, Peach/Mango. Still, it is a good snack and I would try some of the other flavors if I could be sure of what flavor I was getting."
4,OK for kids,"Great for toddler food - good ingredients, good texture. Kind of tasteless otherwise. I like the veggie booty product better for flavor - too bad about the salmonella recall."
3,Edible but extremely bland,"Just received these today. Like others, I wish we could get a variety of flavors - one can only stand so much peach/mango. i was excited,though, to have my three boys try these as a new snack (ages 5,3 and 2) - not a single boy would eat more than one. These think they are awful and the baby (2yo) spit his out and wiped his tongue! I've tried them as well and am not impressed at all. But they are edible. That's all I can say for them."
3,Wrong ISBN,"The book is ok, but if you are buying it as a textbook for a college course, check the ISBN. There are two versions of the same edition of this book (the 3rd). One comes with and online web registration packet. If your prof asks that you have the packet and you get the wrong ISBN, it is $40, plus whatever you paid for the book in the first place. I was only told the title and edition to get, not the ISBN, so I was stuck paying $110 total for the book and then the packet. Sweet."
5,genius & soul,"excellent quality, sound and all items were present, including the book. to be a used item i would surley recommend this product and this seller in the futere, also the item was shipped to me the next day"
4,"Great loader but has a few ""issues""","Just used this for the first time yesterday and though it was a great loader it chewed through a set of 6 AA in about 4 hours. The LED light is hard to see through goggles in bright light. The last loader I used actually made a lot of noise when it's gears moved the balls around this let me know the loader was on and working properly. This loader is much more quiet which I found more difficult to discern whether the loader was functioning, turned on, malfunctioning etc. When my batteries died the loader pushed balls intermittently, would turn off and I couldn't see the red light in the sun so I thought I was out of air or was having a marker problem. When I left the field I went back to the car and noticed the red light and replaced the batteries. But 4 hours on a set of 6 AA's could get expensive to run this thing so I'll run it another day or two with fresh batts and see what happens."
3,Good and less good about this book,"The good thing about this book is, that it tries to describe the style of Ellington through musical analysis documented through transcriptions in notes, and it shows how Ellington was influenced by blues, ragtime and Tin Pan Alley. We are though not told everything about Ellington as composer, as one might gather from the title. It is strange that the author doesn't mention the tradition of categorization of the various styles of Ellington, nor do he explains, why he has ignored this tradition. The book must be understood as a contribution to the full investigation of Ellington as composer.Jrgen Mathiasen, Musicologist and jazzhistorian,"
5,Works well!,"The bar took about 20 mins to put together and I would recommend using two people to do it. Once together it fit well on the doorframe and handled my weight well without putting too much stress on the door. Once in place the bar doesnt move at all even when doing multiple pullups. The instructions say this can also be used as a sit up roller, though I did not try it for that."
2,Not long enough.,"Seems like good quality. However, it's only good for up to 32"" doors. In a lot of areas, code for new homes requires 36"" doors so that wheelchairs fit through them. This bar (and all of the others I've looked at) falls short."
3,pullup bar review,"Works as avertised, The foam rips at the point that touches trim and the trim is dented on either side of my door. Its a great multi-use tool at a cheap price. This bar is worth the money.thanks,kevin"
2,seems ok,"seems like it will work fine if it came with better fitting screws/nuts. but it doesn't, nor do they give you much help with that. can someone give me some info as to how to get it to fit right?"
5,Complete workout for the time constrained,"This is a great, quick, all in one contraption. It doesn't require any holes or extra modifications to the doorway. I do chinups, pushups, handstand pushups, and sit-ups with it, which covers most of the upper body. Just do some neck bridges and some bodyweight squats or hindu squats and you've got a complete whole body workout. It leaves a slight mark from the black foam cushions, but I'm sure they could be wiped off. Again, a good buy for somebody with limited time and money."
1,Terrible!,"I wanted to confirm that I had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers. The Everlast Bar comes with nuts that don't fit the screws. The nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through. I returned it for a new one, thinking that surely this was a mistake, but the replacement had the same pieces. Horrible!However, I was determined to make my purchase work, so I put it together with force. Once I had everything assembled, I found that the bar does not keep together by design; even with the screws pretty secured, the outer loops on the bar (they are supposed to serve as multi-purpose handles) can unhinge and detach from the bar, because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws. That's absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid-air.Thoroughly dissatisfied. I've used the Door Gym and it's much more secure than this."
1,Terrible product,"Poorly designed, badly executed. Want to get hurt badly, this is the product to do it."
1,are you kidding,"Sadly, I did not read the reviews before ordering...It's terrible... still in the box because the directions are terrible and the hardware does not seem to fit. One review says all you need is a socket wrench...well i have a socket wrench, what i dont have is the right hardware... let me spare you the aggravation...buy something else ...anything else"
5,I'd Give It Fifty-Stars!,"I would give this ingenious product fifty-stars. This chinning bar works exactly as advertised. I weigh almost 260-lbs. It holds my weight even in the flimsiest of door frames. And don't I know it. I travel often and my miserly employer tends to provide budget motel rooms. Never has my chinning bar slipped. Some tips. For wider doorways, just slip a steel pipe into the bar's end and slid the foam cushioning to the desired width. Also, replace the two inside bolts on the main bar with wing nuts. That will allow you to instantly break the unit in half and thus increase portability in quantum leaps. I also love doing Matt Fury Hindu pushups with this unit. I combine a bullworker isometric work-out with Matt Furey combat calithenics and chin-ups to give me a better steroid free physique at 50-years old than much younger Bowflex models. BTW, I can do 24-underhand chins with my 260-lbs body weight."
1,Crap,At least provide nuts and bolts that are the right size. Can't believe Everlast is willing to taint their brand name by keeping this product on the market.
1,Wreck,"The screws are too long for the bars and cannot be adjusted, causing the whole thing to be very unstable. The only screws that fit are for the plank of wood that hooks on to your doorway. I could not be more disappointed."
1,Screws don't fit,"The screws are self-locking so they don't tighten down and there's too much play to work well. You could probably fix this with a trip to the hardware store, but you shouldn't have to."
2,this works for some people,"Basically, the problem with this unit is that you need the right doorframe and you have to be the right height as a person... Although the width of my doorframe was fine, the width of my walls were actually thin... So, what happens is that all that's holding you up is a 1/8 of an inch of wood, and if you that slips, down you go... Also, it creates considerable stress on the wall, and the paint started to crack after 6 pullups.. For me, in many ways, this product is an accident waiting to happen...If your walls are 8 to 9 inches thick, your door frame very strong and you are average height (no taller than 5'10""), then this could possibly work for you... I'm 6'5"" and between all the other factors, this did not work for me at all, as a result, I returned it... It's an idea that's almost there, but not quite there yet..."
1,Stay Away From!!!!!,"I purchased this product today and I am very disappointed with it. Reviews from 2005 state that it comes with incorrect hardware. November 2007 they still sell this with the incorrect hardware. The bolts are way too big for this system. I had to use my own nuts to get it tight enough to use. Also it does not fit on my doorway correctly. It fits good on one side of my door frame but the other side is almost off the frame. It barely stays on and if you sway it at all when doing pullups, it comes crashing down!I would not recommend this product."
2,"good idea, but ...",This chinning bar dosen't fit around the molding of my door frames. It will only fit newer frames but those aren't really sturdy enough to hold and it also scratches the wall. I don't recommend it.
1,pull up chin bar,"save your money. won't fit but certain doorways. I am about 190 pounds and when I found the doorway that fit, it cracked the drywall first pull up if it slips, which it does, better have health insurance if you want to buy one anyway, send me an email we can make a deal on a very very slightly used one."
1,Waste of money and time,"Wrong hardware and will damage your wall! It is a complete waste of time, look for some other bar. I returned mine and ordered the Iron Gym Bar. Easier to put together and works perfect!"
1,You have got to be kidding me,"Got this thing out of the box, tried to put it together. I could not figure out why there seemed to be two inches of play in the four main screws that hold the handles / door support to the main bar. From reading on here, it looks like they are basically too long! THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CORRECT ASSEMBLY HARDWARE. China is a big place, you'd think Everlast could find a manufacturer that could figure those things out. Or maybe there was some kind of Spinal Tap thing going on with the screw lengths. Whatever, save your money, anything else on the market has got to be better than this."
2,Could Be Better...,"After opening the box and counting the bolts, I was missing a few. Not sure where they had gone. It seems the were loosely packed so perhaps they fell out of the flimsy box.Lucky I have some nuts/bolts/washers laying in my toolbox and they seem to fit.This bas is definitely NOT for small door frames! If your door is under 26"" in width, then this would not work. My door happen to be 24"" in width. I live in a studio apartment so the only door I have if the bathroom door. I would use the entrance but then people would be walking by and watching me work out.Also, the foam pads wore off on the 2nd set of chin-ups. I basically had metal chaffing onto my door frame.The bar creaks like it wasn't made to last. I weigh in at almost 200 lbs. and I'm afraid the bar might give at any moment.I'll give this bar another 6 months before it'll finally break on me..."
5,Great for the price,"I was riding my bike to work. It was pouring rain outside. I found this chinning bar lying in the street waiting to get run over. After work I took it home. I cleaned it off. And despite being a bit rusty and well used. It works great. Well worth the price of nothing! Who ever threw it out, I thank you."
2,OK,"Its ok. Barely stays in most doors. If you have the perfect door I'm sure it's great, but in my whole HOUSE It doesn't work on any door. You need a big specific sized (molding?) top ledgy thing. Get a bar that screws in!!!"
3,Decent but a littly messy,"Assembling this product requires tools. We couldn't use a regular wrench because the bolts are an awkward size and instead had to use an adjustable ratchet.The wooden piece that props up against the top of the door has an abrasive strip of sandpaper (??) on it. This gets worn very easily - I'm 220lb and only did 2 sets and there is already a place where it scratched a bit.The product works best on doors and door frames with moldings, because they don't leave much room for it to slip. The problem with this is that they will dent and scratch up your frames. So I'd recommend attaching your own bar in the basement or somewhere else in your house over using this product if you own your home."
3,Parts missing!,"Although the item arrived on time and in good condition, like other buyers, pertinent parts were missing (bolts, etc.). Rather than go through the hassle of sending back the product, I am hoping to find these parts at my local hardware store. A friend of mine has the same chinning bar (with all the parts, obviously) and so far, it is excellent, particularly for the P90X workouts."
3,Beware - usability depends on the depth of your doorframes!,"I had no problem assembling the chinning bar; the instructions are basic but anyone with a bit of common sense shouldn't have a problem.The only problem I DID have is that I live in an older house and my doorframes are quite 'deep' compared to those in newer houses. By deep, I mean the width between the two rooms, NOT the actual width of the door frame, which was fine. Anyway, because of the depth of my doorframes, the wooden support doesn't properly locate above the doorframe on the opposite side which makes the chinning bar useless to me in the house I live in. So be wary!!!Overall though, I can see that it would be a good product if my doorframes suited it so I'll tuck it away in the hope that I'll one day be living somewhere I can use it."
4,Handy,It proved out to be very portable and sturdy...fits almost 3/4 doors of my house. I would surely recommend this to my friends.
3,Not for every door,"The piece that should push into the area above the door has a sticker with grip on it. That might say enough. My sticker immediately started sliding when I did a pullup. I wiegh 210lbs. I believe the bar is rated for much more than that. The bar could be about 6"" longer and that would be better for my doorways. However it does work. I had to fasten a piece of trim above the door I use. It provides a lip for the stickered piece to sit on. With out a lip or ledge above the door it wouldn't work."
1,Terrible product...don't bother purchasing,"I purchased this ""multi functional"" product earlier today and upon sitting down to assemble it found that it was missing screws and what was actually there did not fit properly or in any way make the product secure. The nuts don't fit on the screws, nor do the plastic coverings fit over the nuts. Terribly difficult to even figure out how to put together as the directions are complicated and incomplete, not even telling you which screws (as there are different kinds) to place where. Handles were wobbly even after I had finished putting it all together, leaving me doubtful as to whether it could support me. As of now I have disassembled the product and am taking it back to Big 5 where I bought it...on clearance... for $30.00... Don't waste your time or money on this lousy product."
2,"Fine for the price, but not ideal","The bar was cheap and you definitely get what you pay for. It holds my weight (210lbs), but at times, I feel like it's bending. The grips aren't placed at an anatomically correct angle, so your wrists will get worked harder than they should. And the biggest problem I've found with it is that there's no wide grip! You can't even properly work your lats! I'll be looking for a new one."
1,Renters beware,"As mentioned in other reviews, the nuts were dificult to thread onto the bolts. I had to use two wrenches to assemble it. I tried it in four different doorframes. It didn't fit in three, and it damaged the paint on all of them. On the only door it fit, I was afraid it would tear off the trim."
5,Excellent Product,"This item arrived with very good instructions and the appropriate hardware. It was easy to assemble and works better than I expected. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. As a side note, the instruction sheet included warranty information and a phone number to contact customer service in case there were any missing parts. This product came in an Everlast box and was promptly shipped. I don't understand why people who buy products outside of Amazon can criticize those products here - this is to review not only the product, but the product supplied by Amazon - the Amazon ""experience."" Don't be misled, this is a good product that has all the necessary consumer support to ensure a positive experience."
3,Not as good as i hoped,the nuts and bolts are loose and dont do a good job of keeping it together. doesnt really fit in all door ways.
3,It's ok,Not bad for the low prive. The handles are comfortable and the design is very sturdy but I like the Creative Fitness Door Gym better.
3,"Versatile, but...","I was looking for a doorway chinning bar and bought this one because it was priced well, had free shipping, and could also be used for floor exercises. It does not attach in any way to the door, but relies on resistance pressure on one bar to offset your weight on the other bar. One doorframe is now loose and I had to move to another. I would prefer a screwed in fitting that holds securely and allows the bar to be removed. Also, I bump my head on the ceiling because you cannot adjust the height!"
3,"It works, but...","PROS: it works fine, and is sturdy. easily taken down for storage.CONS: it scratches the paint above the door.CONCLUSION: i used to have a bar that screwed into the door frame, I think this Everlast is better than that one. If you don't have room for a stand alone pull up bar and you don't mind a few scratches above your door, this is a good product (And mine came with the correct hardware)."
3,I got about what I paid for.,"Definitely not a precision product. Some of the screws didn't thread properly and it is a bit unstable on the door frame, However for the price, it meets the needs of my teenage son at boarding school, so I am not disappointed."
2,Jenky build.,"Extremely shoddy and cheap constuction. It fit my dorm's door frame well. However, curved bars keep falling out of the holes they fit into, as they're not held in place by anything. The bars on the product kept shifting and moving while doing pull-ups. Did not inspire confidence in the product's stability. I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Everlast Multi-function Chinning bar,"The instructions for assembly leave something to be desired. The pictures don't really show which screw is being used for which part so you have to guess based on number of screws/bolts/washers. Once you get it together, however,it works well. I admit that I may be spoiled by the fact that my previous chinning bar (a different brand) came pre-assembled."
2,Not multi-purpose,"This product is sturdy enough to do dips or pushups, but forget about chin ups or pull ups, which I mainly bought it for. It is portable enough that you can slide on and off the door frame, but the edge of the wooden plank that is supposed to sit on top of your door frame is only in contact with your door frame for 1-2 cm, much too short to be sturdy enough to do any proper pullups. I had great reservations trying to do a pull up because I had the sense that it would slip/slide off the frame once I reached the top of my pull up.For $30 that I bought it for, and the pain it took to assemble this, it is not a very good product"
1,Received wrong assembly item with product,"I didnt buy this product through amazon, I did through another retailer. I quickly went to put it together as it only had a few pieces. I found out that some of the screws are either too long or the bolts don't go all the way down to hold the parts together, making the entire equipment useless."
3,Great product. Great workout.,"Great exercise and a great product. Usually the cushion on those products wear out after a couple of uses which did not happen on this one, except for the piece that touches the wall but this was expected."
4,Good product. Takes a little faith to trust it.,"I've been using this for a couple of months now and works well. Putting it together was fairly simple. Feels a little flimsy at first but I was much more confidant once I understood the physics of this thing. And also what can you expect for something that slips around your door jam, that can be installed in 5 seconds flat. Now if they could only make the pull-ups easier then I'd give it 5 stars. Peace."
3,didn't come with the write nuts for the screws,The gym would be fine but it didn't come with the proper nuts to fit the screws so we still haven't used it. Eventually will get around to calling the toll free number to request proper nuts.
2,Awful product,"Took way too long to assemble, screws aren't the right size.Once I finally got it together, it didn't work on my door frame.Apparently made for door that are very deep, the top part couldn't actually grip onto anything and I fell on my butt.Really, really substandard product."
2,"Missing parts, looked used","Just received my order after paying next day shipping and it was missing the wooden strip required for assembly. Not only that, it looked like it had been used. There was rust on the ends of the metal bar and part of the rubber handles had already been torn. Amazon said they're sending me another one today and I should have it tomorrow. We'll see what that one comes with. I don't expect it to be anything spectacular, but I would expect it to at least be new and come with all the parts! At least they're sending me a return shipping label for free."
2,dissatisfied log 10,"Yes, like all of the numerous dissatisfied customers who had problems with this product, the screws and nuts are not compatible. I had to force fit the screws. Once assembled, the apparatus is unstable to do chin-ups. WARNING: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
4,Great product for the price,"This bar gets the job done with its versatile design and multiple exercises, plus you can't beat the price. Of course, you get what you pay for as it was missing a couple of the PVC caps, and caused some minor damage to my wall. I corrected that problem by adding some felt pads to the wooden part and have not had any additional damage since. Other than those two issues, I highly recommend this product."
3,mine came with the wrong screws!!!,"my set didn't come with the proper screws so i used plastic finger screws..not the greatest idea..the bar fell at least 5 times in the last two months! i twisted my ankle, landed on my back, and nearly cried!!! unfortunately for me, i twisted my ankle in the middle of the swimming season and i couldn't swim properly all the way until finals; not good because i was one of the only varsity boys on my high school swim team!!! But,don't get my wrong this bar is good. my brother has this bar at his house and that one is perfectly. the only reason im giving this bar a two stars is because mine was defective and i got hurt during an important season! if i hadn't gotten a defective bar i definitely would've gave it at least a 4!!! this bar is pretty good for push ups too!"
5,Excellent gadget,"Assembled in 5 minutes out of the box and works perfect, i don't know what the other people bought but my equipment works great and would recommend it to anyone, great for travelers!"
2,Everlast? Probably won't be ever lasting.,"CONS:1. Incorrect hardware: Like other reviewers, the nuts and bolts do not seem to be the best.2. Harms surface. One side that holds on to other side of the wall has a very abrasive surface which will mar any paint/finish. This material was probably chosen to prevent slippage, however rubber might've worked as well.PROS:1. Cheaper than others.CONCLUSION:For the price it's okay, but I don't think it's going to last 2+ years of daily use. Very annoying was the hardware provided which doesn't seem to match the description in the user manual."
1,Are you kidding me?,"The item came with the wrong screws and nuts. I had to wait for the correct ones but they never did send me the right ones. Right now I had to find the right screws because if you follow the instructions, the screws and nuts that connect the bars are oddly loose. What a piece of crap."
1,HORRIBLE,IT FELL OFF THE DOOR AND HIT ME IN THE NOSE CAUSING ME TO GET 4 stitches!I will be returning it!
2,"Unfortunately, this isn't ready out of the box: it's missing parts!","When you open up the box, you'll find the parts and quantities do not match the quantities indicated on the instruction sheet. The item came with the wrong screws and nuts. In fact, the ""instructions"" come with a few lines after ""step 3"" which instruct you to call the customer service department (number provided) and parts will be sent. When I called, the person said that this is common and that they will send a ""pre-packaged set of parts"" so I can only hope they send the proper screws and nuts.UPDATED - they do send the proper screws in a week or two."
1,Piece of crap,"Wow! What a piece of garbage--nuts and screws that come with it are barely compatible making assembly very frustrating for one person--comes with no tools to aid with assembly--after finally getting it together and mounting it, didn't have the confidence in its stability to actually try a pull up on it--felt as if it wouldn't hold well and that I would wind up on an episode of America's Funniest Home Videos--do not recommend at all!"
1,Terrible,This Cheap knock off slid down from the door frame and almost broke my nose. There was blood involved. I only weigh 160lbs. It doesn't do what its supposed to do and that's sad since its such a simple concept. When I showed it to a friend who has something similar she was shocked by the terrible materials used for this thing. It feels cheap and flimsy when you take it out and i should have known then not to put all my weight into it. If you don't want a nose job then please try and find something like this but not this.
2,Unfortunate,"The earrings are nice indeed. Unfortunately, not safe at all for small girls, since they easily get lost. The safety pin, or however it is called, gets off too easily. And I am not talking about her touching the earring, but simply doing a normal girls life. I had to intensely look for one earring at least twice, as it got lost, until I finally lost it for good! and I am talking about not having used the earrings more than two weeks. Too expensive to loose them and to have lost them so easily!!! I could not even get to prove whether they were actually hypo-allergenic or not since my girls would usually get allergic of gold earrings after weeks or months!"
4,Alexis Rocks,Love the cd mostly because of Alexis. That girl rocks. I saw her in branson last year and have been waiting for anything to be realeased by her. For all you music fans look out for alexis. I think she is with Warner Brothers and we need to be asking for her. (...) If any one has info on her pass it on. Save the music kris
3,Only about 6 good songs..........,"This CD was not as good as I expected because most of the songs weren't very good. But the six songs that were fun to listen to (That Girl, Ready, What Are You Waiting For?, Lindsay Lohan Melody, 1-2-3, and A Day In the Life) were very uplifting and lightening. If you like pop and rock, this CD would be great for you."
1,teeny boppers are terrible,terrrrrrrrrrrible cd. i hate it. there is no substance to the lyrics. it's too teeny bopper. this is not what real music is supposed to be. (...)
4,A CD that is worth a listen,"This is a soundtrack that is definitely worth a listen. Lindsay Lohan does a great job with all the singing in the movie. In the beginning, even I had my doubts about her voice and thought that she was a Hilary Duff wannabe, but she definitely proved herself in this movie. Freaky Friday showed some of what she can do, but this soundtrack shows it off. Lindsay's song are sang very well. I can see her with a very popular record in the near future. If you think that she is crap, just give her a listen...you never know until you hear it."
4,Upbeat and fun!,This cd is very upbeat and fun and full of rockin' chicks (with a little Simple Plan thrown in there)! Lindsey Lohan has a great voice. The entire cd is refreshing and bound to make you want to sing along!
4,"Very Good, But Not the Best","Songs in this album:1. Drama Queen 3/5- Very annoying after listening to it for a while.2. Ready 5/5- One of my top songs in this album3. Ladies Night 4/5- It is not the best, but ok to listen to4. Perfect 2/5- Once I started to listen to it, I just couldn't like it.5. Tomorrow 3/5- It's ok6. What Are You Waiting For 3/5- Not her best work7. Na Na 5/5- Great Song! One of the reasons I got this album.8. 1,2,3 5/5- Another favorite song, it is has a great tune!9. Don't Move on Medley 2/5- I didn't like it.10. Boom 2/5- I only liked listening to it ocasionally. It's not the best song...11. A Day in the Life 4/5- A pretty good song. (But, it gets stuck in your head sometimes)12. The Real Me 3/5- Good Voice, but i couldn't get into it.13. Un-sweet Sixteen 4/5- I liked it, although it was a bit annoying.14. Only in the Movies 2/5- Never really liked this song.Overall, not a bad album at all. I would suggest people buy this CD."
2,good,"Lindsay does well with the pop voals ....but my favorite song of hers is the clip that's featured on tis album called ""Don't Move On'. I think Lindsay's voice sounds a lot btter with ballads.Nice that Lillix's remixed version of Tomorrow is on this cd.I'm just not into the pop-punk boybands on this album."
3,Not my fave album,"I was pretty excited to buy the soundtrack, but I was kind of like the movie; disapointing. It does have some awesome songs on it, but others really started to bug me."
1,Losing video on 1 year old tapes!,"For the holidays, I just pulled out some old tapes to show the family. I don't understand why, but the video on the old (recorded ~ 1.5 years ago) TDK tapes is fading and disappearing altogether! This happened on all 4 TDK's! I have a few Sony and Fujifilm tapes that are the same age, if not older, that don't have any problems at all.I'm glad I found the problem when I did, before I lost everything on these tapes! I will be transferring these videos to Fuji tapes this weekend and throwing away the TDK's.I recommend you look elsewhere for your video tape needs."
5,"Erotica, Therapy, Sociology--The Most Amazing Book About Sex","I first found this book in my Dad's bedroom when I was 15-years old. I am now 21 and I still think it's incredible. The only thing that has changed is my appreciation for it. I now know how rare it is to find such fearless and honest erotica that really turns me on. Some of the fantasies, notwithstanding, aren't for me.This book is also therapeutic: A friend of mine was recently thinking of seeing a sex therapist. She did, but I also helped by giving her my copy. She hasn't given it back, so this will be my third, counting my Dad's which I read until I moved out.""Women on Top"" is a great reminder or proclaimer of the fact that sex is a natural part of our existence and our everyday lives, and should not be taken for granted.I think everyone over age 15 (depending on individual maturation) should own this book and be given a sexual education that includes teaching the biology, anatomy, intellect and emotions of sex."
3,So-so,"I bought this book looking for some shamless erotic reading, and I must say, this is deffinently not what I was looking for. There are a good number of erotic-themed stories, but there is even more background info about the writers of each story, and then analysis by the author as to what each fantasy ""means"". The book does make for interesting reading, but is not great for erotic purposes. I am very glad I am liberated as a woman, but I don't need politics in my sheets."
5,WOW!!,This book has stayed by my bedside since it came out in hardcover. Most of the stories left me breathless and eager to read more. I strongly recommed this book to singles who need alittle 'fantasy' to help them through a lonely night or for couples to snuggle up and read together. Very educational for men who would like a deeper understanding of how women work.
3,Women on Top: How Real Life Has Changed Sexual Fantasies,"I just started reading the book... The author was recommended to read by a friend. It seems to be an okay book so far, but I just haven't been able to really get into reading it. It doesn't grab you from the start; it's somewhat a slow read at first, but I'm expecting it to pick-up after the first chapter."
2,Quit with the psychobable,"If I wanted to read a book about the psychological reasons for fantasy and an anaylsis of how women are changing through time, I would have read one by a psychologist. Reading a small sample of fantasies mailed to you does not make you an expert. Stop analysing and just report like you did with the first two books!"
5,Love this! Finally a more up to date.,"As a reader of ""My Secret Garden"" and ""Forbidden Flowers"", I was looking forward to having a more recent book. Here it is! Things have changed since her first books, but the best thing is that I think women are open about sex and fantasies"
4,Good but could be better,"I am not an expert in all aspect of security, thus I find the book very informative. Security is a chain of process covering all inter-connected equipment and applications. The book not just descibed (briefly) network security, but also includes systems and applications. The title of the book could be misleading as it reads 'Network Security', it could have just been 'IT Security'. There are some misleading information in certain vendor specific systems, which I am familiar, causing me to doubt the accuracy of the other vendor specific information, which I am not familiar. The author could have kept all information as neutral and avoid treading on thin ice. I do not think a second edition will be published unless the book is re-written."
5,Knife review,"The Wustof Grand prix II 4.5"" knife is a good product - we got the knife on time just as advertised"
2,Only one,"Yes a definite Legend!! There a singer in the U.K. named Elkie Brooks, I always felt a duet between Ray Charles and Elkie Brooks, would have been something else. Alas! not possible."
5,Lift Every Voice and Sing !,"This CD is well worth the price for the classic Ray Charles singing America The Beautiful. His soulful versions of Randy Newman's Sail Away, John Denver's Take Me Home, Country Roads, John Lennon's Imagine (featuring the Harlem Gospel Singers), are added bonuses. He makes every one of these songs his own.I decided to purchase this CD when I heard Ray's rockin' rendition of Lift Every Voice and Sing. Even the syrup-y strings and too-perfect background singers on Somewhere Over the Rainbow can't squelch the gritty soul when Brother Ray sings that old chestnut."
4,"A great help, complete and concise","I found this to be a good aid in learning calculus; it is short but contains enough examples to be useful. Its brevity aids in finding what you are looking for, a drawback many larger and longer calculus-help books have."
4,Great soup - costly to ship,"The person I bought this for lives in South Carolina. Apparently you can't get Andersen's Split Pea Soup in South Carolina. She loves it, so for that I would give five stars. However, shipping costs are determined by weight and soup, though inexpensive to purchase, costs a fortune to ship. So I can only give it four stars.If you are willing to bite the bullet on the shipping costs, buy the soup, it is very good split pea soup."
5,Heart of the Highlands CD,I absolutely love this CD!!! Visited Scotland/Ireland in 2006 and 2010 and purchased the CD at Culloden in 2010. Purchased the duplicate through Amazon to have as backup. Love Amazon!
1,One Teacher's Review,"This textbook is one of the most boring texts I have ever read. While the information is timely, the presentation of it is difficult to read and the purpose of the language used appears to be more to impress the reader than to impart knowledge."
3,Review for Education Book,"The book came exactly as described, the payment was taken care of with no problems, and the book arrived within the timeframe given. Overall good seller and good experience."
1,Try Walmart,I almost bought this item to reach free $25 shipping. Stopped at Walmart and bought the exact same thing for $3.99.
4,ok i guess,"bought these to replace my dead batteries in my glucose meter. As reported by others, there is no expiration date in the packaging of these batteries. So far, they are working ok."
3,Good so far,"I ordered these to change batteries in the car remote, tho I didn't get the product first time around an email to the seller resulted in a quick reply and a package that I actually received. That apart, the batteries themselves are good and have been working well so far (a few months old now). Will need to see as the ones I had almost lasted a few years, never changed since I bought the car."
2,Test shows less than 20% ??,I ran these batteries on my fancy new battery tester and the tester flashed red and said that they were almost flat so perhaps they are old stock as a lot of folks have said here. Will use them for a couple of weeks and if they are indeed duds will be reporting this outfit to the FTC.
3,As described... kinda...,"The picture on Amazon shows the 'retail' card, however, you actually get two snipped from the ""5-pack"" strip. The batteries themselves seem to work okay, except they're a bit old. Considering the price for two, shipped free, was cheaper than what I would pay at a retail store."
1,Not as Advertised...not 2 per card as shown in photo,"If you are looking for 2 batteries per card as depicted in the photo (and as you would find in a retail outlet), do not order this product. The product is delivered as a strip of five batteries in individual blister packs. No date code on package."
4,Did You Fly?? UPDATE Nov 2012,"This is a great deal folks, if you happen to be in a store and see these at a lower price that's great, BUT if you drove ANYWHERE to get them you just lost money. These are delivered to your door and if you have Amazon Prime (as I do for years) 2 day shipping is free. You need to think the whole thing through before you give a deal like this 1 star. I love having to go no farther than my front door to get them. Just for the record, nobody is questioning the quality of the product which is 4/5 stars easy. IMPORTANT NOTE: It seems that from time to time Amazon changes the seller for these and not all are on Amazon Prime so look closely if that is important to you. One week it is and the next week it is not. Still a great product.UPDATE: Well the last batch I got was 2 from a commercial box, no date, not as pictured and came in a think letter size envelop that almost got thrown away in the trash as junk mail. They do work but I have no idea how old they are."
3,Very low upon arrival!,"As soon as I placed the batteries in my remote, the remote immediately indicated the batteries were dead. I do not know if the batteries just sat on the shelf too long or what, but I will not be buying batteries from this company anymore.. You get what you pay for!"
2,Half a decade old packaging,"The title says it all. The batteries I got were from the seller National Deals and were half a decade old (from 2006). No matter what the brand, there is bound to be some leakage. The reason I give it 2 stars and not 1 is because at least right now the one battery out of the pack that I am using seems to be working fine."
5,They keep going and going and going,Put these in my alarm key fob remote and they have lasted many many months. Energizer always makes a good battery. Thanks Amazon and Amazon Prime!
5,Very Pleased,My item came with 48 hours of ordering it and was as described on Amazon. I am very pleased. Thank you.
5,Bought for Car Remotes,Bought these battries for two of my car remotes. Cheaper than stores and Fast shipping through amazon.Have to wait to see how long it lasts. Will keep posted..
5,"Prompt Delivery, Great Seller!",These batteries are just what I needed to replace dead ones in my flameless LED candles. I am very pleased with this item and my ordering experience was quick and easy thanks to Amazon. ~ Great replacement batteries!
4,Good,good one since the price is low. Also fits into weighing machine of mine. I am happy.Dont know the battery life yet.
2,Unsure,"Have not yet received this item. I have been in touch wiht the sender, who resent a couple weeks ago. Have not yet received either item."
1,Wrong Packaging,I Bought this product thinking it was going to look like the picture. I own a buisness and was planning on putting these batteries on the shelf to sell. The battere=ies that i got look like they have been cut off a big packaging with a pair of scissors and im left with an item that can not hang on a peg like displayed in the picture when i was buying. I am sure the batteries will work fine but the packaging is not appealing at all when im trying to sell it.
1,Don't buy DEAD Batteries,I ordering these thinking great it beats Radio Shack. I needed for my toll pass for Florida Turnpike.First time out nothing...Did not work I have not checked the second one as I gave that away but will get it backI will be fined by the State of Florida for this
2,whatever,"I mean they're batteries, what do you expect. I'm not THRILLED WITH THEM. but i'm not disappointed with them either."
4,"Good batteries, slow shipping","The batteries themselves work fine. However, the item photo does not have the same packaging as the item that was actually shipped, though the item I received was in fact Energizer brand watch batteries in a sealed Energizer package.But for such a low price with free shipping, who can refuse? Just be aware when purchasing, the batteries took 7 days from clicking ""Buy"" to their arriving at my house, and they arrived in a normal mailing envelope.When it's all said and done, I'll probably purchase this item again the next time I'm in need of this battery type."
3,uhmm....,"So I saw these and thought, wow that's a decent price, especially since it says no shipping and handling.I can just get them right in my mail and wont have to go anywhere.... No shipping and handling, maybe when you order, but when the mailman arrives with them you have to pay up. I ordered these for price as well as convenience, so me having to drive to the post office to retrieve them and pay postage kind of defeated the purpose.... if you have to PAY shipping they should not say free shipping, kind of ticked me off a little. The Batteries work fine so far, but I am also only on day two.add: almost 2 weeks, now, since I have put these batteries in my reading light ( which I use every night) and they still work great"
3,Doesn't come like pictured,"These came in a silver package, & not in Energizer's package. I don't have anything to put em in to see if they worked because I had thought my scale needed new batteries but it turned out my scale was just broken."
1,Wrong batteries,"The page where one might buy an Army pocket watch shows these batteries as an accessory for the watch. It is not, but about 5 the times the physical size. The actual battery is a SR626W. I ordered these from Amazon and not another seller. Buyer beware!"
4,Great bargain,"The batteries are made in Indonesia, not pictured as in Japan. I don't know if the quality is the same. So far it's still working. Great price though."
2,Old Stock,"Much like many of the other reviews, I received old stock batteries. I used them anyway as I needed to for a car remote and they seem to be working fine. Buyer beware!"
3,Not Exactly what the picture shows,"Product Description3VCardboard card for peg hookYa...well that is not what I received. I recieved two punch pack that looked like it was tore off of a bigger pack. There is no expiration date, but on the back of the pack it shows copyright 2011. So they are not exactly BRAND new. I like the price, can't beat that any where...we will see how long they last!"
5,Amazon shipped worked like a charm,I heeded the do not buy from reviews above and did my best to click on a provider to ship these Prime. Batteries arrived in two days by UPS. I popped them into my bathroom scale and they work perfectly. The expiration date is 2032 so these were fresh batteries.Usually they last one year. The last batteries I bought at the local store lasted about 6 months which was very odd. They had a long expiration date too.
5,good value given you don't have to drive to get them,"The title of my review pretty much says it all. Sure, you can get these cheaper at some retailers, but if you make a special trip (not all stores carry these), you just spent more money than if you bought them on Amazon."
5,Great and affordable!!,"Target wanted 7.99 for two of these suckers and I got them off Amazon for only a couple bucks, shipped to my house for freeeee!!! The packaging is different than what is shown but the item is as described. Will purchase again when I need more! Thanks!"
3,"Well, they are energizer 2032 batteries",The picture shows the cardboard packaging like you would find at Wal-Mart. The ones I received were in a bulk style packaging. Took a long time to ship as well. Only ordered them because all the local places I checked were sold out for some reason.
2,I did not get what I expected,I expected double pack of energizer batteries DATED just as shown in the photo what I got was a strip of batteries. they do say energizer and made in japan but are NOT DATED so I have no idea if they are fresh. I purposely purchased this one instead of some others on this site so that I could guarantee fresh batteries.
2,OUT DATED BATTERIES NOT GOOD,BATTERIES WERE EXPIRED WITH 2011 DATE AND NOT PACKAGED AS SHOWN. NOT AS EXPECTED THAT IS FOR SURE. NOT GOOD.1-2-2013
1,Lasted 30 days topps,"I ordered this for my garage door opener, it lasted maybe thirty days and then it quit actually left me stranded outside my own house, even though it says energizer it cant be because they have way better quality than this product"
5,The price is right,"I remember seeing in the past that these were awfully expensive, and thinking ""what is amazon thinking"", then recently I looked back, and they are much cheaper.Actually cheaper than buying in your typical store.Great batteries at a low price, hurrah!"
5,Know your model number!,"- Good battery from energizer- Know your model number when ordering, electronics/watches usually have specific model numbers- I used this battery for a wireless car key, big improvement over the worn down factory batteries.- Pleased with the delivery from the third party seller, quick and accurate!"
5,Great Product!,"Ordered these from SwatchBattery. They were made in 2011, so they're relatively new. I used these to replace the batteries in my Speed Stacks timers. I've only had them for a few days but they have been working great so far. Excellent replacement batteries."
1,Rip off,"I bought these batteries and figured I might be in trouble when the packaging didn't match the picture. Sure enough, the batteries were all dead when I tried them. It's a small purchase amount but I hate getting ripped off--and the fact that Amazon doesn't seem to care who they do business with."
1,"Energizer Watch/Electronic Batteries, 3 Volts, 2032, 2 batteries (Lithium Button Cell)","They were not in the package as shown and there was no expiration date on the batteries, I emailed them about that and they didn't get back with me."
1,Old Product,"Should have read the reviews before ordering from this seller (Best Deal Supply) . Batteries were old but worked so I didn't think much of it. One month later, my key fob is dead again. Who knew to read reviews for batteries?"
5,"Good Price, Good Service","The seller offered to replace one of the batteries that ended up bad when the package got mangled in shipping.The batteries are Energizer brand. This price is less than I could find locally.There is no expiration date on the individual packs because they are from master Tear Strips. But, the seller is happy to let you know what the date is from the master strip. These are brand new.Some people complained about tear pack batteries. I don't mind, as long as I know the date. Besides, there's less package to end up in the landfill (or hopefully- recycled).The seller includes a printed receipt. That's a nice touch, since this is a business purchase.Would I buy from them again? Yes!"
3,Time Will Tell,"I purchased this item to have some back ups on-hand. As others have noted, they arrived in different packaging than shown, but they did arrive promply in great condition. Since I do not need them immediately, time will tell how they actually perform when pressed into service. I will update this posting once I start using them.The price was great as my local hardware store wanted over $16 for a twin pack!"
3,Not too sure about these,Batteries arrived USPS in a reasonable amount of time. Was not very happy to find they were not packaged as pictured. One of the battery packages was already opened and the other was questionable. Tested both batteries and they were in the green but only about 25% in the green. They both work okay but not sure just how long they will last. Time will tell. At $1.00 each I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Batteries made in 2011 but they work,"Even though they were made in 2011 lithium batteries have a 10 year shelf life, they work great in my car alarm FOB. The price is great(much cheaper than a retail store) and the distributor shipped the same day."
4,Good batteries but old stock.,"I just received these batteries, they work good, and the shipping was fast, but they are old stock. The date on the back of the package says 2006 so they are 4 year old batteries and the white paper was yellowing so these are not very fresh batteries but so far they are working."
1,Do not by from MYBATTERYSUPPLIER,MYBATTERYSUPPLIER it store front has new pkg when you order and this old man sends you some 2006 old batteries. I got them on the 15th now its the 19th and they stopped wrking
1,Unreliable & deceptive,I received the batteries in a different package than what is shown on the Amazon site.I checked the battery charge before first use and found it was already almost dead.Don't buy from this seller!
1,Received defective counterfeit batteries when ordered directly from Amazon,I ordered directly from Amazon and not a third party because I didn't want to risk receiving a counterfeit battery.I ended up receiving a counterfeit battery that provides zero power. My uploaded customer image shows how I could tell it was counterfeit.I'm buying my batteries directly from brick and mortar stores from now on.
1,The batteries have a short life,"i bought these batteries and used it only a month(total about 5 hours),then my dictionary(with two batteries) no power to appear the letter. Power is off!"
1,The Batteries were DOA.,"I'm in too good of spirits to rant. But the gist is this company sells old dead batteries, so you probably want to look elsewhere. Both of the batteries were dead.My managers buy batteries online also, they have the same problem. Lots of companies apparently have a ton of dead batteries they are just pawning off instead of recycling.Hope this helps, don't get scammed :)."
5,Good Deal,I am using one of the batteries now and may buy more later.I will give these a try.I liked the price of these
1,Used for bike light - died in 2 weeks,"I do not recommend these batteries. They are cheap, but they died within 2 weeks of being used for a front LED bike light. I used those lights for about 15 minutes a day."
5,"button batteries are the best, but don't eat them or let your children eat them","they worked just like batteries!!!!!!! But the price was fantastic about 1/12 of the wal-mart price. I thought walmart was supposed to be the cheapest for everything, duh"
2,quiet dissapointed,"It looks new and is an Enegizer battery, although the packaging is not as shown, and looks old.I would not recommend it unless you don't actually have time or you are lazy to go to the shop."
2,2032 Batteries,"Even though these were brand new batteries, they had lost most of their power before I even opened the package. As soon as I placed them in my device, the red indicator light came on, telling me that I needed to change the batteries."
5,Buyer,The batteries were exactly as advertised and they arrived without delay.In addition the price was lower than I'd seen at anywhere else.
4,Great Price and it works,Got it within 1 week and use it for my garage door opener. The price is much cheaper than local store (about 1.50 each). So it is worth the wait.
3,It is good I think,It is good I think because they send me the same batteries but does not look like the image. It is in a smaller paper cover. It come in from the mail but I almost throw it away because it feel smaller. I was going to sell it to my friends but now the cover is just white paper so my friends say no. I might as well keep it then.
2,Dead batteries,"These batteries were dead upon arrival. I'm not satisfied with the product, and will not be ordering these batteries online again. Going to buy them in store from now on."
5,Great for Apple Remotes,I purchased these batteries to replace the batteries in my Apple Remote for my computer. They worked great and haven't had a problem with them since purchasing them. It's been over 3 months and still running strong.
5,Watch battery replacement,Bought this to replace a battery for my timex ironman watch. I looked at the battery from my watch and it said 2032. I matched it with this product on amazon and I purchased. Watch now works and I'm happy. Prime makes store buying seem out-of-date.Go prime.
3,Not as pictured,"The picture isn't what I received. I received two separate batteries that looked like they were cut from a retail package. There's no expiration date on the package, so there's no way to tell how old they are."
1,There's A Reason These Are So Inexpensive,"Such a great price, and by using the top-of-the-line Energizer packaging on the offering, we think its such a great deal. What arrives is a brittle silver package with 2 batteries that appear to be Energizers, or could be aftermarkets. It don't matter, the fact is that it feels cheap, it feels like a ripoff, and the seller leaves that bad taste in your mouth, and that feeling isn't worth the promised savings."
1,These people are horrible!,"I received the wrong item, sent it back for return and was told I'd be sent the correct item....they just resent the wrong item. Really frustrating and annoying!"
5,Pretty soap,I must have needed a really fragrant soap I was after the vinegar soaps but require scented. This is the kind I tried once in Orlando and if you are checking out reviews and you want a scent that is strong that is why I am directing to this. Irish spring and Dove are alright but I really wanted my scent to be strong and real clean. Most of the reviews are positive and I am not lying when I tell that this is very high quality. I am so pleased. There is high quality product... when my Zest runs out now I will have this to use and any of my other roommates or relatives may try it. I am happy I could find this here. This is a thrillingly good soap I have fallen in love with the fragrance. I love to get a really good clean shower and feel like I am so clean and have a nice glow on my skin. Perfect really. My kid from my egg donation may try this. I am satisfied and will recommend it.Andrea Somers
5,Hard to find this great soap!,"I am thrilled that Amazon carries Bee and Flower Sandalwood Soaps! I used to be able to find it locally, but it seems to have disappeared from the stores here. My husband and I have used this soap for years and enjoy the lasting scent and the gentleness to our skin. I have very dry skin and this Bee and Flower Soap is better for my skin than any other bar I have found. I just ordered 4 of the large bars and a case of the small. Can't wait till it arrives! Thank You Amazon for supplying more than just the ""ordinary"" brands."
1,Nothing like the bee and flower soap I know,"I have purchased Bee and Flower sandalwood soap from numerous stores in the past and have always really liked the sandalwood smell. When I ordered this from Amazon/PierMall, the soap looks the same but smells just horrible and chemical. It's like a really intense version of unscented soap -- imagine Ivory soap smell magnified times 10. I'm not a picky person in general, but this is unusable. Maybe this is counterfeit soap? What a strange idea."
1,Not Sandalwood,"I love the scent of sandalwood. This soap isn't it. There are some very good sandalwood soaps available on Amazon, just keep looking. This soap has a strong petroleum aroma, mixed with the scent of metallic crayons. It smells of chemicals, made in China. I threw my order out. You do not want to rub this on your face or body."
4,Like It,Good soap for the price. No complaints about this soap yet anyway. I like this soap but I only used it once.
5,It's the only soap I'll use now,I have really sensitive skin and can't use most soaps sold in retail stores. I found this soap at a natural foods market a few years back and all my skin problems went away. You can't find a better smelling soap that won't cause skin irritation for the price.
5,My China Doll loves it...,"I live in Montana, far from Chinatown. My wife a beautiful Chinese lady has always gotten her soap via her sister in San Francisco. Finding it on Amazon was great and at a lower cost than paying shipping from SF. Bought the 12 bar pack and my wife hides it everywhere. Even my shorts smell like sandalwood now."
4,Nice soap - but NOT cruelty-free.,"The description says ""no animal products"" -- then lists tallow as an ingredient. Tallow IS an animal product! This is a big deal if you're a vegan. Otherwise, enjoy this delicious sandalwood-scented soap!"
4,Smells wonderful!,"Some reviewers felt that the fragrance is not 100% consistent. At first, one of my bars smelled a little different, but it started smelling like sandalwood as I used it more. I absolutely love the fragrance! The soap is slightly drying to my skin. You can use an unscented or sandalwood lotion. Fabulous price! I keep the extras next to my bed, so I can smell them when I'm relaxing."
5,Bee & Flower Sandalwood Soap,"I have purchased 3 cases of this soap over the past few years. It smells heavenly, lathers well, and is an excellent value."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this for myself, because I love Sandalwood, but it was more floral smelling than I like. I gave it to a friend and she loves it."
3,Not sandalwood scent at all,"My soaps came quickly and well packaged but the product itself is awful, a total waste of money. The only scent is a weird, unpleasant, chemical aroma. The soap doesn't even lather. Years ago this was a great smelling soap. Whatever they've done to it has ruined it and I will never buy it again. My guess is someone didn't even bother to put the essential oils in this batch of soap when it was being made. No way I'll bathe in this soap either. Into the trash it will go. Nasty stuff.****I'm changing my rating from one star to 3 because my brother ended up taking these soaps and he likes them fairly well. Apparently some where better smelling than others. I only know it wasn't what I remembered it being. He had never used it before."
1,Rip off!,"I ordered this thinking it was for 4x, meaning a set of 4 bars. Other places sell this soap that way. This was actually for one bar from this seller. You can buy this soap for around 1.49 at the grocery store. I just don't live close to a store that sells it. Be advised that this is marked up much more than a store sells it and you can buy this sandalwood soap at it's regular price in a brick and mortar store."
2,Not the right size.,Just got these in and I am disappointed. There are 1 1/2 inch size. Either they are mislabeled here on Amazon or someone packed the wrong ones at the warehouse. Too much of a pain to send back. Really not worth it. I'll try to make do with the larger size. Just a bummer cause my project really called for 1 3/8. Now Im sure I'll tear it appart and rework it.Other than that they look fine. I think the only thing worse would have been if they came broken. And fortunately they are intact.
4,eclectic but enchanting,"a collection of African pop (?) that have the portuguese language as the common trait. pop is probably not a very good description in view of the variety of styles, from the salsa to cape verdien morna. Some of the songs are very forgettable, but some very haunting. I bought it for the first song in the CD by Bonga, which by itself is well worth the price. overall, it gives you a nice sampling of the great musical diversity of that part of Africa."
4,A Tempting Stranger - Lori Copeland,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER""You have the disposition of a witch, the tongue of a shrew--and the body of an angel;"" he whispered seductively in her ear....Just the kind of thing a man like Garrett Morganson would say. What had Chandra Loring let herself in for?Engaged, her own wedding only weeks away, shed agreed to pose as a stranger's wife. But she'd picked the wrong stranger and played her part too well. And now Garrett Morganson, the new vice-president of Rhodes Aircraft wouldn't let her go. Handsome, arrogant, he was Mr. Wrong from the word go-yet why did his arms around her, his lips on hers, feel so right? What was the matter with her? She knew what she wanted. Why couldn't she leave? Why couldn't she say no?"
3,The Title is Misleading,"While I found the book interesting, well written, and informative, I felt it missed the point of the title i.e. Slavery & Profits...the ""Dark Bargin"". I expected a more detailed analysis of the extent of slavery's impact on the economic interests represented at the convention. Instead I got a unrelated albeit interesting perspective on the individual participants with a much too subtle reference to the slavery issue.I got the feeling an editor, or someone representing the publisher, embellished the material to give it a more marketable title. I felt the same way about H.W. Brands book about FDR: ""Traitor to His Class..."" An interesting read but far from a disertation on FDR's betrayal of the moneyed interests of the wealthy."
5,Enlightening!,"I had no idea how much slavery impacted the creation of the Constitution and what the founding fathers battled through to produce the document that became the foundation for America. I also confess I never knew that rice, not tobacco, was the primary product produced in South Carolina at the time and why slaves were so necessary. Goldstone gets an A+ and a gold star for both having thoroughly done his homework and for explaining things as they happened while keeping opinion out of it. He allowed me to draw my own conclusions. What made this book exceptional is the background information he provided on each of the founding fathers he zeroed in on. Should you be looking for an unbiased, non-revisionist explanation of the challenges and difficulties these men faced in creating the Constitution, this is an excellent read. And if you are anything like me, I suggest you keep a paper and pencil handy, because you will find yourself taking a lot of notes and looking things up for yourself."
3,Has Its Uses,"Out of print.Decent, simple side and top pictures of airliners and provides basic info about 80 built between 1946 and the mid 1960s.Price was right and found info I wanted."
2,Disappointing basic patterns and expensive to make,"This book contains patterns for tops, vests, cardigans, etc, made with rayon ribbon. Most of the items are very basic and not interesting or innovative, except for the crocheted purses which are attractive. The recommended rayon ribbon is the author's own brand which, as it turns out, is rather expensive to purchase. Although she cites several companies who are also producing rayon ribbon, the author does not offer equivalencies that would make it easy to find and use the right ribbon. All in all, a disappointing book."
3,No sweaters for crochet,"I received this book as a gift from someone who knew I could crochet, but wasn't sure I could knit (I can't). Despite the fact it says there are knit and crochet patterns, there is only one wearable item for crochet in the whole book, and I'll bet those of you who've gotten burned on this kind of book before can guess what it is too: a granny square vest. That's all crochet is good for, you know...There are some purses in crochet too, but they were very common patterns of types I have already."
5,Dave at Night RECOMMENDED,The book I read was Dave at Night by Gail Carson Levine. My favorite character is Sully. He is a nice Gonif who helps Dave. I thought this book was awesome. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action. It is basiclly about a boy that has everything go wrong. He has to try everything to stop the things that happen at the HHB (Hebrew Home for Boys). That is what I thought about Dave at Night by Gail Carson Levine.
5,An original & riveting novel for young readers ages 8 to 12,"When his father dies, Dave finds himself placed in an orphanage (the cold and strict Hebrew Home for Boys in Harlem) far from the life he knew on the lower East Side of New York City. Outside the gates of the orphanage, Harlem is a world of jazz musicians and swindlers, exclusive parties and mystifying strangers. Inside the orphanage, Dave finds rare friendships and bitter enemies. Somewhere Dave must find a place that he can call home. Gail Levine is a talented author and Dave At Night is an original and riveting novel for young readers ages 8 to 12 and a highly recommended addition to school and community libraries."
5,A book guaranteed for young readers,"This book Dave at Night is a great book if you like action, adventure, and excitment. It is a great book for all ages with interesting characters, plot, and how the whole book is planned out. I think the author of this book should be very pleased."
5,Very Great,This was one of the best books I've ever read!Gail Carson Levine probably put a lot of effort into this book.I felt really bad for Dave in this book.He was in a very sad situation.I like how Gail used very descriptive language.I thought the nicest person in this book was Arma Lee because she liked Dave weather he was rich or not.
4,What a life,This is a book about a kid that lost his father because he fell off the roof. Dave has to go to the orfanige where he meets other buddies. Dave hates the HHB. (Hebrew Home for Boys) One night he sneeks out to go to a party. He falls desporatly in love with a girl from the party. Does he want the girl or his buddys from the HHB.
2,"a book review "" Dave at Night""","WOW, This was a book that I had to put down.It wasn't the worst but I've read better.I am really suprised I finished this. But don't listen to me see what you think.This story takes place in Harlem, New York. This story is about a boy named Dave. Dave is very young and his mother died when he was little, and his father just passed away.Dave is stuck in an orphanage till one of his family members can take him. His sister Ida is too young and doesn't have enough money.The rest of his family is too poor, have too many kids or are to old. Dave meets lots of new friends and learns new things. This was an okay book I guess. I didn't really like this book because it took too long to get to the action."
3,A comment...,"According to factual reports from orphans of the period, most of the Jewish orphanages were warm, compassionate places, and the orphans - now elderly - have memories of joyful years spent there."
2,disappointed,I bought this brake pad for my car and start squeaking noise immediately after installed. Amazon offered me a replacement.
5,Best Shoes,"Best shoes and a perfect prize, if I can buy this shoe for the same prize I will order 5 paars"
3,Simple Simon,The story moved along quite nicely until about 40% into it and until about 60% it dragged in my opinion. After that the story held together quite well and was enjoyable. For a Spy drama it is ok but not outstanding.
4,very intriguing,I would recommend to any mystery fan. Very compelling. Kept my interest all the way through. Nicely written and recorded.
4,Good Read,"A little wandering at times, but very interesting. Worth reading for any mystery fans. My first Art Jefferson read, but will read more"
3,"Good thriller, but has gratuitous graphic violence","The inside cover blurb describes it as ""Rain Man"" meets ""Wargames"". Having recently seen Altman's ""The Player"", I thought this was a joke pitch. I was wrong, it was serious. Clearly written with a screenplay in mind. The graphic violence was unnecessary to make the point about the ""bad guy"" and will never make it to the screen. Unbelievable conversion of another ""bad guy"" from one who works through influence to cold-blooded murder. The ""good guy"" was too saintly. Interesting twist: a shadowy, secret goverment organization engaged in good works"
2,"Fast Pace, Weak Writing","This book had a great deal of potential. It seems to have been either over-edited or the author had not researched his subject matter very well.It is very fast paced, extremely so, with shallow character development and only cursory details about where the action takes place. There is a subplot about a sadistic assasin that one wonders why is in the book. The premise tends to insult the reader's intelligence. It is also sexist and marginally racist.It is also evident the author was not trying to authentically depict the intelligence establishment or the use of cryptography. There seems to be a 1970's sense of mistrust of the government written into the novel as well as a sense of governmental incompetence.The characters are cliche but friendly and this book will keep you reading it, however, it will not take very long, the pace is maddening and the details few.For a brief, if not unsatisfying, distraction, Simply Simon, fills the bill."
3,A Promising Suspense Thriller,"I started reading this story which went in many directions without any links. I stayed with it and the links finally connected into a believable suspense involving secret encrypted messages to keep the government secrets and communications out of the wrong hands. Obviously there are those who work for the government, but at the same time work on their own to make their riches by selling secrets. The story line is good, but the characters are too many and they are not that well defined to keep the characters straight in one's mind. Also, the writer's style tends to be a little too wordy and tends to burden the reader. Such style distracts from the excitement of the story. I wish I had passed on this book."
3,Definitely A Thriller,"I hadn't realized that this was the fourh book in the Art Jefferson series. In fact I didn't even realize that something appeared to be missing.Anyways, I do not typically read thrillers but I was really hooked on this one and I read maybe fifty or so pages in one sitting.The violence and gore really set me off but I liked the plot and how the different stories intertwine. Although at the beginning it was somewhat confusing with all of the head hopping, it made it easoer to read so you wouldn't bore with one story.If you like excruciatingly detailed violence, chatacters ou can love and hate, a little something to keep you up at night, and a puzzle within a puzzle this book is for you."
4,"Different from the movie, but just as good!","The movieMercury Rising [Blu-ray] staring Bruce Willis was based on this book. There were some differences between the book and the movie, but the overall plot was the same. I liked them both. If you enjoyed the movie at all, then I would suggest you try the book. This is my 2nd Art Jefferson thriller I have read on my Kinde (Cloudburst (An Art Jefferson Thriller)was the first) and I have enjoyed reading both. Ryne ranks up there with David Morrell as far as I am concerned (The Naked Edge,Creepers, and of coure his most famous:First Blood) and I have been reading David's books for years. I have two other Art Jefferon thrillers on my Kindle and I am looking forward to checking them out."
4,A fun read,This was a good read for a vacation trip. The depiction of Simon may be off but that doesn't hurt the suspense.
3,Simple Simon,A good story that could have been better. Character development could have been stronger. I never got a good feel for Simon's capabilities and whether or not he could communicate in a near normal fashion. He was more a charicature than a character.
4,Riveting!,Always enjoy a book that ties everything together - eventually. Enjoyed the way everything tied together and made the reading worthwhile.
4,Simple Simon,"Very good book; a real look into autism. I want to see the movie (Mercury Rising) based on the book. I know I saw it several years ago, but now I can compare it to the book."
4,Exciting Thriller,This fast moving story of an autistic 16-year-old who solves one puzzle too many and his FBI protector is well-written and suspenseful. I found it hard to put down and read it in one sitting. Recommended thriller.
3,Ok,Hard to follow at times. Too many character named and then not involved for some time. I doubt I will buy any others.
4,Keeps your attention,"Yes, I would recommend this book. Keeps you guessing until the end. Love that!! Looking forward in reading another one of his books."
3,S s. Thriller,"Book carried a good amount of suspense , but could have had more descriptive areas. On the whole, a good book.."
4,Willa :An American Snow White,"There are no friendly little men in this dark adaptation of the well know children's fairy tale. As a whole, I found it to be exremely dark and the music was strange and eerie. Some of the scenes involving Regina were disturbing, to say the least. (ie she burns alive) Not for children."
4,A scary soundtrack,"This is a compilation of what we can call ""normal sounds"" but they can scare the hell out of you if you are alone, the place is dark or it's late in the evening. I found that there are some sounds that can be considered out of place here. Phone sounds or machine guns are not ""typical"" of Halloween. But we have also the classic ones: gongs, chains, creaking doors, laughters, wolves, screams... The footsteps are very realistic. You can hear it almost from beginning to end without noticing. There are no pauses between tracks, and it's good also if you are planning on make your own compilation. Highly recommended!"
4,Film soundtrack waiting to happen,"It's so unfortunate: there are some cool sounds featured here. How great would it be to see a film, a visual compendium to match? Unfortunately, that film hasn't been made. Horror film needs to embrace minimalism, atmosphere, and mood. All we've had for years is sledgehammer to the face, over the top, metal soundtracked, FX OD fests. Close your eyes, walk through darkness, and try to evoke something resembling a chill or two with this."
2,**,"I bought this after a rave in FORBES, but it's kind of a hybrid memoir/business advice book that doesn't really work. And when he mentions his 24/7 work habits resulted in a divorce, that for me canceled out every bit of ""advice"" in this book. I know too many comparably successful men who spend a lot of time with their families. If you can't manage that balance, then you shouldn't be writing advice books."
2,Shoulda Been a Pamphlet,Mr. Harman espouses hard work and integrity. There - I just saved you hours of time and the cost of this book.
2,What is important in life?,"Dr. Harman had four children, worked 24/7, and divorced his first wife after 25 years. Ten years before the divorce he took up golf and played weekends, leaving his children, entering their teenage years, for his wife to raise. At age 60 he married a woman 25 years his junior and according to the book had two more children with her. They are still married, after some 25 years.This book contains anecdotal information regarding the environment in which a large company operates, and some things to consider while doing so. That info is useful. The author also deals extensively with business ethics. This is less useful. His ethical model was apparently different at home than in the office."
3,Did not fit BT marker,"I have a BT-4 Combat marker so I figured since it is a BT product it will fit... WRONG! This only fits rails similar to the Tippmann 98, as it states in the description. So here's a helpful guide for anyone looking for accessories for their BT-4: Rails=Tippmann A5, barrels=Tippmann A5, stocks=Tippmann 98. Other than that, its a sturdy piece, would have looked great if it fit. That is the only reason this is a 3-star and not a 5."
4,"An excellent, concise guide to guns and shooting","Malloy's book is the best single source of information for those who are beginners or intermediate-level shooters and for those who seek a broad, yet knowledgeable treatment of shooting and guns. The book covers, rifles, handguns, shotguns, blackpowder guns, airguns, reloading, buying guns and care & cleaning of guns. In each section, the author writes about different mechanisms (actions), cartridge types, shooting techniques and types of shooting (competitions, plinking and etc.). While I am not a beginner, I am not an expert with years of experience with guns. I definitely learned a lot from this book. Malloy's writing style is casual, easy and concise. I strongly recommend this book as a general reference book for every shooter and gun enthusiast. I also recommend it highly for those who recently took up shooting or for those who are thinking about getting into another type of firearm (from shotgunning to handgunning, for example)."
3,Write book if you are the write reader...,This is a very informative book for the novice to intermediate... It brings old information of a historic nature together with shooting information we can all learn something from... If you are looking for more critical shooting science this may not be your cup of tea.... But for the right reader it is a great addition to the gun library... Over all we enjoyed it...
1,boring boring boring,"Extremely boring. I bought this after having purchased my first rifle hoping to understand many of the complexities of firearms, instead this book is an encyclopedia of minutia filled with useles historical data on out of date guns and ammo. Perhaps this is useful for the collectors out there but if you want current info try something else."
4,A Classic Personal Narrative,"The author went on to have a long and noted career as an academic and government official. He was chief of the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) and the Assistant Secretary of State during the Johnson administration.Roger Hilsman graduated from The US Military Academy in 1944 and was assigned to the OSS, Sent to Burma, the author commanded a guerrilla battalion, ambushing Japanese patrols, blowing up bridges, spying on the enemy, and slipping back into the teeming jungle. later he went to the prison camp in Manchuria where the Japanese had held his father and helped liberate him.This is an articulate and informative memoir. In the course of his career the author has written many political and policy books. This gives a sense of the man behind the job."
5,Outstanding collection,"Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 3, ""Polish,"" is my clear favorite among his first three symphonies. I also like Glinka's seldom-heard Symphony on Two Russian Themes and Stravinsky's delightful Symphony No 1, ""Classical Symphony."" To have these three outstanding works coupled together on one CD is a rare treat. As usual, Svetlanov excels in conducting Russian music. Lovers of Russian music should grab this outstanding collection while it is still available."
5,Fascinating reconceptualization of global/local in Istanbul,"This book is a must for anyone seriously interested in Istanbul. Not a travel guide, this book is a collection of essays by Turkish scholars addressing the cultural and material significance of both the ""global-city project"" in Istanbul and the influx of migrants from rural Turkey. Keyder's brilliant analyses (he contributes three essays to the collection) are matched by the other contributions, all of which are historically and theoretically grounded. Anyone interested in urban studies, world-cities, the global/local dialectic or Turkey today will benefit from reading this book."
2,Most of the recipes aren't items that are primarily gluten-y items.,"Most of the recipes are for stews, main dishes, appetizers, etc. that aren't based on wheat to begin with. It doesn't take a genius to substitute corn starch or rice flour for a roux to start a soup/stew. Many dishes are protein based, and don't have much to do with glutenous ingredients. What's the point of including them? Waste of paper. I like the 'Everything' series- but this was a waste of money."
4,Great Music,"Since Teddy passed away, I wanted to get some of his music as a momento. The CD is great, I may order more. The only complaint is the case was cracked but for the great price I got it's not a big deal."
2,Not enough depth!,If you are looking for indepth explanation of how to exploit different features of Sharepoint then this book is not for you. This book is good if you want and can survive with a high level overview of sharepoint.If you want to know of things like:-Branding-Details of ONet.XML-How to use FrontPage to edit website.-Best practices for developing Sharepoint based solutions.you want a different book.However this book does have its merits if you are starting with sharepoint and want to get up and running soon. It does have a lot of pointers as to where you can get more detailed information.I would disagree with most reviews posted on this website which claim that this is a must have book for sharepoint. Use of your discretion is highly recommended.
3,A Real Improvement from Earlier Models,Purchased an earlier version of his (circa 2005) and threw it out after two months of use. The case itself was solid but the hard velcro closure on the side became exposed if the case was slightly overpacked. Result: completely ruined the pants on two expensive suits from the closure rubbing while I walked. Incredibly poor design. Received this model as a gift (would have never bought another one myself). The problem seems to have been solved with the new closure system. It's a bag. It holds my computer. It is black. Not much more to say.
5,Dream of mine,"I don't know if it's the soccer player in me, or the fact that I'm half-Portuguese and it's in my blood, but I took to this album instantly and I never have tired of listening to it, in 6 years. Great rhythms and enchanting voices, this is just one entertaining disc to have, and a great primer for anybody interested in Brazilian music. It also offers a lot of insight into the sociopolitical climates of the times from when these songs were released, and the translations and history included in the CD jacket are much appreciated, and enhance the listening experience all that much more. A truly great collection of music that I have every confidence in recommending to you if you want something different that has a great dance beat and I dare you to sit still in your chair while you listen. Enjoy!"
4,A Solid Follow Up,"While not as resonant as GAME OF PATIENCE, TREASURY OF REGRETS is a very entertaining one-day read. More of an old-fashioned Agatha Christie style plot (someone's poisoned the Master and which of his nutty relations put the Arsenic in the old miser's porridge?), the novel provides strong characters, compelling historical details and enough surprises to keep the pages turning. Recommended for fans of the earlier book."
4,An Engaging Introduction,"Great philosophy here: an excellent guide to gender motivation and energy polarities. David Deida is brilliant, with a visual style of interpreting the realms of transpersonal psychology.I've given this book 4 stars only due to poor editing - it becomes redundant after the first few chapters.Saturate your mind with Deida's work at his `Blue Truth' site, or visit `Integral Naked', where you can watch some of his workshop videos and interviews for free!"
4,"Understanding the sensual aspects of ""relationship.""","I liked this book because as a sometimes ""clueless"" male, I appreciate all the insight and help I can receive about the female energy and the intricacies of male/female relationships. David Deida walks you through everything he has learnedh in his life and career about the subleties , looking from both sides. This book helped me understand more about myself, how typically ""male"" I am, and how to be more sensitive to the needs of a woman. Thank you, David !!"
4,Great Concepts,"Glad I bought this book. The concepts are very useful, although the text gets a bit out there and perhaps expounds too much on the basics."
5,Solid as a rock!,"I bought mine used through Amazon marketplace and I love it! In a world of disposal products, this thing feels like it was engineered to last a lifetime.I use it to hold four 19"" Acer monitors and assembling it is easier than an Ikea coffee table."
5,Guys Review,Hands down one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. My wife and I laughed all the way through it. I laughed because I thought it was funny. She laughed because it's true.
1,STOLEN MERCHANDISE,This vendor is selling our product without our authorization and stealing our money. The product being sold by this and other vendors is not authorized for their sale.
4,"wow..... can't beat the price, and sound",really good subs for the price..... I installed into a customers car with a 850 watt amp and these things knock!.... so worth the money!
3,Not our favorite,"I bought this tape for my daughter, who is 23 months old. I purchased Toddler Favorites and one of the Disney classics at the same time. She prefers the Toddler Favorites to all the others. This tape (Children's Favorites) has an odd musical selection. Some of the songs are unfamiliar and rather outdated. I think we were looking for something a bit more cutesy and upbeat. Still, we do listen to it and a couple of the songs are cute."
5,Gung Ho!,This book reports the Pacific campaigns of the United States Marine Corps during World War II. The narrative kept my attention throughout and I found it hard to put this book down. It is one of the best accounts I have read about the USMC in WWII. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an overview which portrays the Marines' sacrifices during their brutal island hopping strategy which was instrumental in America's ultimate victory over Japan ending WWII.
2,"Item arrived used, not new","This item does help with keeping small and large paperback books open and stable, and it is particularly useful for paperback cookbooks. Because the product does what it says, I gave it two stars. I ordered this product 'new'. Unfortunately, when the item arrived to my house, the packaging had already been opened, and the clip was clearly used multiple times. The protective coating was absent from the two bottom prongs as well as from the top arch which touches the edges of the pages. The entire reason I went with this more expensive clip was because reviews suggest that the protective coating is necessary to prevent page tearing. I recommend the product, but not buying it from this particular seller."
1,Junk,"As others have said, this thing is pure junk. The rubbery coating is sticky and smells horrible, typical cheap Chinese coating.The wire is too stiff to be used without ripping pages and the rubber rubs off.Save your money for something useful!"
1,Toy is overpriced,This toy was disappointing on every front. It lacked detail and you virtually needed a microscope to see it.The value simply is not there
3,Contract/Garmin,Haven't had the chance to use this contract. Only hope that is was worth what it costs.
3,"haven't used it yet, but at least I received it","Hey, I just wanted to share some less dark comments about this. I purchased this coverage despite all the bad comments -because I thought bad coverage is better than no coverage. I haven't had to use it yet (knock on wood), but at least I received the coverage contract within a week. Nothing to complain about so far."
1,Avoid at all costs....,"Take it from one who had a close friend and fellow attorney who used to work as in-house counsel/advisor to these thieves....you will want to avoid them at every possible turn. Unless, of course, you enjoy shelling out your $$ for an essentially worthless ""warranty"" and/or ""service plan"" that will require you to do nothing other than jump through hoop, after hoop, after hoop. Stall, delay, deny...these are their operative words, written in their corporate policy and procedure manual. Sound like something you'd want to get in bed with?"
1,Rip off,This is a complete rip off. The protection they provide is worthless since they do everything they can to frustrate your attempt to make a claim and to find any excuse for not fulfilling their commitment. Save your money.
2,Two Year Service Contract for Asus MyPal A626,"How can you rate a service contract that you just purchased for an Asus MyPal A626 Handheld PC/PDA? I got the Service Contract in case something happened to the Asus I ordered from Amazon on April 10, 2009, and still DO NOT have!!!!!!!!"
2,Service Plan,"I was unable to utilize this plan due to a dicrepancy at Tiger Direct. Tiger Direct as unable to fill my order. Therefore, I had to cancel my plan. I was told that it would take 6 to 8 weeks to receive my refund. I feel that that is an excessive amount of time to wait."
5,Garmin,"The product purchased works very well. It is valuable and useful for anyone traveling, and the 2-year Service Plan will cover any problems the product may incur."
1,CR doesn't recommend,"Consumer reports doesn't recommend extended warrenties. If you still want one some credit cards will double the manufacturer's warrenty. Also usually going to the manufacturer and buying one is a better solution. Sony's for example is much better and cheaper. I had a bad experience with them...they use the HMO approach and in some cases you have to prove you didn't break it. For example, my HDMI connection stopped working with my Samsung and the repairman said this doesn't happen unless you broke it (very rude). I had to fight it and finally got it fixed but it wasn't worth the hassle. Stay away from NEW. One last option is to go to B&H Camera which sells warenties at reasonable prices and they are reputable."
1,service????,"after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement. of course you want a hard copy, that is why you bought it. just do it."
1,Doesn't cover most things that happen,"Don't believe the ""if it breaks"" part.Breakage- like physical damage- is NOT COVERED. So if you drop it, something (or somebody)heavy lands on it, or it gets wet, FORGET IT."
1,Have not seen,I have never seen a copy of this service plan. Is it available on line or should I have received a paper copy?
1,Extended,No review or terrible review - because I am not sure how this sysytem of extended service plan works with this seller.Was this supposed to be an email document or something more solid that I am supposed to get in the mail? I am unsure because I have not received anything in the mail so please clarify asap.
2,Lacking information!,"BEWARE: this coverage starts immediately, NOT after the mfg'rs warranty runs out which on the iPod is one year. So by purchasing this product I LOST a year of coverage. I reccommend checking elsewhere for a plan that starts AFTER the mfg'rs warranty expires."
4,Good Solid Debut,"Yes Donny&Stevie's Vibe are all over the place here.but Frank Mccomb still has his Voice that puts everything into Perspective.alot of folks are sleeping on a Good Talent that will only get better with time.Hearing this Disc&You hear other Artists today doing bits&Parts of Donny&Stevie but here you get the Whole plus an Artist with a Bright Future.I Believe with a Few More Records under his Belt he will really Shine but this Cat Should Not Be Overlooked.The Production,Musicianship here are really good.Check this Out real Mellow&On Point."
3,FRANK MCCOMB (LOVE STORIES),IT'S A GOOD C.D. THIS BROTHER SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE DONNY HATHAWAY IT'S UNREAL I WOULD GRADE THIS C.D. A (B) WORTH BUYING
3,Kind of Disappointing,"PEACE:Yes, I know that I am not a professional music critic, but when I got this CD, I was expecting to hear a CD full of beautiful heart-moving songs like the ones he sings on the ""Buckshot LaFonque"" CD (or at least half of them). Those songs are simply breath-taking. I fell in love with his voice.So when I listened to this CD and did not hear the same quality songs, I have to admit that I was kind of disappointed.Frank McComb's voice is like magic. The Brother really has a gift. I wish him much success in the future.LM"
3,McComb REALLY has a beautiful voice BUT.......,"I agree that he needs to refine his songwriting a great deal. Each song sounds the same, actually sounds like old Stevie Wonder songs that he never recorded (because they weren't up to his standards back then). I await his next release and hopefully he utilizes an outside producer/ songwriter (Babyface? D'Angelo even?)....."
5,This is real R&B.,"I first heard Mr. Frank McComb's voice on the radio on ""Gotta Find a Way"", and I was blown away! I had to find out who this person was! I went out and purchased the CD after reading reviews on Amazon. This man not only has an awesome voice, with perfect pitch and tone, but he also has unique lyrics, which never fail to relax and soothe me. I would, and have, recommended this CD to everyone!"
4,As powerful as Anita Baker's very first album.,"I first encountered Frank during an album by Buckshot LeFonque -- he did three songs on that album, the most popular in terms of radio airplay being the mid-tempo ""Another Day."" Then there was the overwhelmingly romatic ""Better Than I Am,"" followed by ""Phoenix."" This man's voice is, as others have stated, just like Donnie Hathaway -- no getting around it. But it's better than that -- he is the Donnie Hathaway of today's generation -- and we should treasure this work.It is definitely NOT one to sleep on -- the entire album is true to it's title, ""Love Stories."" Each piece works love magic -- but my favorite (other than the ""Wedding Song"") is #10 -- with a chorus this powerful ""someone who'll take time from their day and spend it with you -- one who will go to the extreme to give you love.""Please buy this and lift the talents of this magnificent artist."
4,Just saw 'em live,"I didn't get a chance to buy this album when I saw them but, let me tell you, live they put on a great show. They kind of remind a person of the Stray Cats (swing rock) along with some straight up blues (depends on the song, some swing, some are blues).If I was you, I'd take the chance that they are just as good in the studio and buy the album."
5,Detroit bluesman,Deming is just terrific. Fantastic guitarist/singer. Plays great swing blues. This fine player should be more widely known. Seems very underrated in the blues world. A friend from Detroit says he is held in high regard in the Motor City. This disc is recommended.
1,harley Wallet Excellent glad i purchased it.,"I purchased this excellent Harley wallet for an excellent price. No Harley shop in Hawaii could match this price...plus this is an excellent wallet with excellent craftsmanship, sturdy, flexible and lots of room inside for my money and cards, keys and change."
4,Professional cassette tape,"I have always preferred TDK to any tape on the market, largelybecause of it's smooth transport mechanism. Although many userslike Maxell, I think the TDK Pro SM60 is my overall choice sinceMA60 has become unavailable. I use two decks, a Teac W-860R anda Pioneer CT-W 606DR, in a home studio for practice sessions witha Southern Gospel trio."
2,A true dissapointment from an almost legendary band,"I bought this cd after being a fan of the band since their debut, but with every release since Animals With Human Intelligence, they've been slowly getting worse and worse and worse, and finally, this album, aside from a very few high points, is practically unlistenable. I don't know what happened to the band's edge. The seem to have traded their hard rock style for sappy, soulless alternative pop. I gave it two stars-One for their awesome past, the other is for a better future."
4,Brings you back to a time where you want to go back,"This CD is a classic on my records. Everytime I listen to this CD I think back when it had just came out, EVERYONE wanted to know the words, they would play it over, and over again. A real ""time warp""!"
5,fun video,"the 6-8 year old crowd loves this. i think older kids would like it, too, but I can only speak to this age group."
4,Good Exegetical Resource,"This book has been occasionally helpful to me in doing my exegetical work, done mostly for preaching. It's not a book that I use every single week, but when I want to find out how often and where a phrase occurs in the Bible, this is the place to do it, and the book is usually more thorough and faster than the Internet. The limitation is that it's written using the English language, and I have found that phrases that are categorized as the same in this book are more often than not the same in the original language. You may have to look each phrase up in the original, but in that case this book gives you a good starting point."
4,Good foreign action flick,Good story and lots of action. Had to use sub titles to as in Eastern European language. Long movie but enjoyed.
1,missing subtitles.,"Ipurchased this dvd for a friend for Xmas, thinking that my friend would enjoy it as it did have on the front cover."" English Subtitles"" but my friend has recently informed me that there are NO subtitles of any sort and the whole thing is in Polish. Seeing as how my friend does not speak Polish this was a wasted gift that has caused me much concern. First for my friend, who lost a gift, and for myself who has lost money from this dvd that is useless to both of us. It seems a pity that this has happened, because I'm sure that it is a good series."
5,Battery and Charger are great,"I received this product as we were heading out to go camping. We had a 3 hour drive ahead of us and by the time we got to our camp site, the battery was fully charged. I really like the convience of having a battery charger that works both at home and in the car.I am also very pleased with the price. I would tell others to buy this product."
4,fun in the sun,"I liked the concept of this moon board. It seems very tricky to get the hang of. My husband was more successful than my sons. You definetly need sneakers to manage even staying on the board as it is slippery! Maybe when their more adventerous friends are over, and the grass is cushy outside - then we will start hopping around!"
2,Big Time Toys Moon Board,"Great idea, but cheaply made. This broke about 3 weeks into using it, and there isn't a way to fix it. Another $20 down the drain and into our nation's landfill."
1,Waste of money!,My kids never play with this. They asked for it last year at Christmas and I donated it this year to goodwill in perfect (unused) condition. Don't waste your money on this one.
5,Discs that do their job,I have a Sony CD recorder I use to record live performances. These discs work fine on it and I have had no issues with them. These discs are specific music discs which are required to be used on this kind of recorder.
