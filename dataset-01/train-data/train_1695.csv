4,How We Live,"Over a decade ago, Dr. Nuland wrote a brilliant ""How We Die"" in his attempt to demystify death. Now he is attempting the same goal with aging in his current book. There is the same clinical descriptions of the body along with brief biographies of those aging well. The author could have used a more forceful editor as the writing is occasionally over the top but never dull. Overall, an excellent thought-provoking read."
1,don't waste your money.,"This book offers no new insights biologically or philosophically for living through the final years of life. It reads like something from Parade magazine. It's not even a 1-star rating, but a zero star is not available. The material presented is trite, banal, hackneyed(I know these terms are essentially synonymous, but I employ them for emphasis.) Look elsewhere for received wisdom regarding living through old age. I am 58 years old and am entering my later years. From all the glowing cover blurbs I anticipated there might be some food for thought within. Just junk food."
5,Great gift !,"This book hit so many of my current topics - aging self, aging parents - all articulated and explored by the author but leaving room for personal rumination. I bought another half dozen copies and have begun sharing them with family and close friends."
3,Useful,"As academic material, several chapters in this well written book are extremely useful as well as illuminating. However it is irregular in its interest and questionable in its physician to patient involvement.The author's reputation preceeds this work."
1,"Disappointing after his great ""How we Die"" book","I looked forward to reading this book after reading his excellent ""How We Die"" book. The writing seems unedited and there were too many run-on sentences. It was just too hard to find the nuggets of wisdom that I'm sure are buried somewhere in this book."
5,Insightful and encouraging,"I first encountered this book as an audio book through my local library. I was so intrigued with parts of it after listening that I purchased a used copy through Amazon. Perhaps it is a little wordy at times, as other reviewers have noted, but you get the sense of man with a great vocabulary, a brilliant mind, and a certain style of writing that shines with a genuine caring for people.In my opinion, chapter six alone is worth the price of the book. Through a series of letters written to an older widow, the author addresses the topic of depression and aging in a way that is tender, thoughtful and incredibly respectful of this woman's point of view. If you are a person facing the changes associated with aging yourself, or know of a friend or family member who may be having difficulty with some of the issues we will all face sooner or later, I highly recommend this book as a guide in shaping a realistic, yet positive outlook on the aging process."
3,"Worked as advertised, then it broke...",Bought one with the watch and GPS receiver from ebay. Came here looking for a new one because the plastic started cracking and tearing around the pads that read the heart rate and the watch stopped picking up a signal from it within a year of owning it. Tried to get a hold of Timex because it was still under warranty but I got NO RESPONSE from them. Will try again...but you can bet I will go Polar when I buy a new setup.
2,mixed feelings,"I was amused when I read on the instructions that ""battery life should average two years"". I can't get one year out of these straps before they quit working. They seem to use up three or four batteries, then quit transmitting, so my choice is buying the whole package and accumulate watches and non-working straps or to continue to add to my collection of worthless straps. I would welcome input from anyone as to how these can be made to last longer. Are we supposed to remove the battery when not in use? Washing out the units and allowing to dry completely does not bring back the dead units to life. My frustration with Timex is great here, but am not sure of workable solutions."
2,Check your watch model,Be very careful to check your watch model. I didn't pay attention and now I have an expensive decoration! Other than that... I'm sure it would work fine if I had a compatible watch.
3,Not compatible with all the heart monitors,"Not compatible with all the heart monitors, this device does not work with my watch, watch instructional support are very clear in the product box and not in the description on the web page.Now I have this accessory does not work"
4,Good Product,I see others have problems but it works fine to me. I mean it is tight around my chest but it is suppose to be. It does not slip down when I am running so I am happy. I use mine with a timex 686 watch.
3,Does not work with Timex Global Trainer,It was not obvious to me after reading the reviews that this heart rate monitor is not compatible with the Timex Global Trainer watch. I am giving it 3 stars because I have no idea if it works.
2,A disappointment,"I bought this to replace a Belkin product that was terrible. This one, unfortunately, isn't much better. The signal it broadcasts must be really weak because it's impossible to get a clean signal unless you're in the middle of nowhere. If you live in the city, forget it. You might as well listen to what you're trying to listen to through a can and string. The scan feature - which I was most hopeful about - is terrible. It rarely finds a good station to tune to and always seems to pick the same couple of stations.I don't know whether these FM tuners are so weak because of regulation or they're just bad products, but regardless, they don't seem to work well at all."
4,Harmonium,"i recieved this item a few days before the exact date, so that was good. when i played it, i liked the sound, but when i played it with someone on acoustic guitar, it sounded even better, it's really easy to make songs up on and sounds great when played with other acoustic instruments."
1,Ms. FS,I wanted to get a basic and simple Harmonium and so I purchased this one. I was really disappointed when it arrived. It was a cheap wooden box. It sounded like a trumpet and nothing likea harmonium. So I returned to the seller.
5,A GREAT ADDITION TO MY TSUBO SHOES...,...even tho my past friend Marcy Marie would say Tsubo was uncomfy it is not so...they are not made for BIG women for the most part yet FIT men and women...hehehe...she is a HATER...but for the most part the TSUBO APOGEE is awesome for FIT folks...seriously a FIVE!! A great ADDition to my awesome collection with great compliments!!!!
4,old time radio cd's,"Got this for my dad for Christmas,when I asked him what he thought of it he enjoyed listing to the cd's,brought back memories from when he was young."
2,plastic emits odor,"This ipad case is colorful and functional, but unfortunately as one of the other reviewers described plastic emits a nauseous odor. It also got on my fingers and made them stink as well. Had to put it in the garage to let it ""air"" out for a few days. i will update my post if the odor goes away."
1,Awful smell,"Purchased for my wife, she loved until the smell reached her nose. Tried putting it out side for two days, it didn't help"
1,"MOST AWFUL CASE, EVER","This case is a piece of GARBAGE. Within ONE day all the little gems on the corners had already starting to fall out. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE. Even if you were to paint over the corners with clear nail polish, (which is something I usually do with gems and rhinestones) this cheap, crappy case would still fall apart."
2,"pretty to look at, but that is all","i love the sparkly cover. unfortunatelly it smells so bad of petroleum, that it is making me sick. i had to take it off."
1,Ugly,Nothing lie the picture it's ugly in person I returned it and bought something way cuter and this looks like its hard its not
2,Simple glitter sleeve,"This case is very simple. It doesn't protect any aspect of the phone but the back surface. So, don't buy it to help protect the screen from scratching or any part of it during a drop. Otherwise, it's a basic glitter case. It's so impractical, I haven't used it yet."
1,Save money,Well the price and shipping was great. It was fast and package great. I order the pink one and the color was just what I thought. But I did not expect for the case to feel ruff and for the color to fall off. Everything I touch the case a piece would fall off and feel more rough. Save your money. Perfect color but not worth the outcome
1,Poorly Made,This iphone case looked poorly made and didn't offer much protection for my phone. Didn't end up using it because of that. The glitter on it looked cheap as well. Would not buy again.
5,Fun Glitz,I bought this to get away from the boring I-Phone covers. I've received lots of compliments and people asking me where I bought it. It also is easy to find in my purse!
3,"Love this case, but.....",I really love this case and have gotten a ton of complainants on it. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the ends began to fray within weeks of having it on. A couple months after having it on it is fray beyond just the ends. Needles st say I love it now have to buy a new case.
3,Ehhh its okay,doesnt quite fit the ipad mini the way its suppose to. it is however a beautiful glittery piece. comes just as shown in the picture however it doest really fit the corner of the ipad mini
3,"Color is great, texture is not.","Just got my cover today. The color was perfect, just like the picture. I don't like that it is rough feeling. Also it doesn't cover the ends of the phone. Not sure if I will keep it."
3,"Cute, but will not last long","I like the look of this case, but it hasn't even been a month and it is already peeling. There is a mesh lining that holds down the glitter pieces and it is peeling off the back. Already looking at making a new case purchase..."
1,Former Dittohead Still a Megalomaniac,"Condescending is too weak a word for this blog-become-book.Boasting about no longer being a mindless idiot after 13 years is difficult. Crowing and patting yourself on the back at the same time is a real trick.What the author is really revealing about himself is naked opportunism. There's no new insight or information here, just a desire to be applauded by his new political compatriots. It will not surprise if he suddenly, in another 13 years, discovers he's been duped again, and writes: ""Confessions of a Former Kossack"".Read a couple of his bloviated blog entries to get your fill and save yourself 11 bucks. Or wait a couple of months and pick it up in the remainders bin."
5,AWESOME collection of trailers. A must buy for 3-D fans,"This is a great DVD, I can't recommend it highly enough. Containing original theatrical trailers for almost all the 3-D movies from the 1950's, along with some rare footage from 3-D movies going back to the 1930's, it is a must for fans of the stereoscopic cinema. A couple of the trailers are 3-D versions specially converted to the anaglyphic 3-D format, and the 30s footage is also in this format, the enclosed glasses are all you need to watch that portion of the DVD."
3,Interesting Look Back at 3D,"DVD contained trailers of many old 3D films, which I enjoyed a great deal, although they would have been more interesting if the trailers had been shown in 3D complete with glasses. This made viewing somewhat disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the other books in the series and really like the central character, but hated this particular novel. Worth persisting with the series as the next two books are much better."
3,"The Long, Long return","Unlike most of his novels, Nesser plays tag around and around he action in this STORY until one grows tired of trying to anticipate his next step.."
3,I never saw the ending coming and it is vital if you want to understand the character in further books.,"A body is found in the woods missing its head, hands, and feet. Can thy ever learn its identity and ill the police even care when they do. Recovering from surgery to remove cancerous intestines, Chief Inspector Van Veerteren is back on the case and he isn't going to let it go.The book by itself was okay, but I never saw the ending coming and it is vital if you want to understand the character in further books. So only read this if you plan on reading the others, because you will get something in Van Veerteren that you will find no other fictional policeman."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Fairly lame, more steamy romance novel than vampire book.In retrospect at the time that should have been more obvious, but somewhat disguised by the generic black 80s horror cover."
1,BIG WASTE OF MONEY,"Before I bought this item I saw the reviews on amazon.com. But now I see that it was probably the own editor of this book who wrote them. This book doesn't show you anything, but its parts and how to hold the guitar. It only compares a few different styles of music (rock, pop, blues, jazz). I know about the different music styles, if you guys want to learn how to play the guitar buy another book. This one is worthless. And on top of that, the DVD does not even work. It must be another region or something, but I tried playing in on three different DVD players and it wouldn't work. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM, YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED!"
5,iPlayMusic Level 1,I have tried so many methods and have been unsuccessful until now. iPlayMusic Book and DVD are clearly explained and had me playing in no time. I highly recommend this item. A+++
3,"OK rice, bad Basmati","I bought this because it was the only basmati rice the supermarket had. I've only made one cup so far but the results were disappointing. Usually when making basmati rice my whole apartment smells amazing but this wasn't very aromatic. The end product was mushy, the grains were broken and not very flavorful. It didn't taste bad and I will use the rest of the package, but I won't be buying Texmati's American basmati again."
4,"Nice tasting rice, just a little $$","American rice... very nice taste and cooks well in a rice cooker. Supports the American economy and the price reflects it... but I try to buy American when I can. Lots of plastic, for not so much rice, but you can reuse/recycle the containers."
5,Nice Rice,"Wonderful sticky rice. Being buying this brand for about 5 years.Try it, you will like it! If not send to me!"
1,DOESN'T WORK ON V551,"Cable was advertised to work with the Motorola V551 phone....which it doesn't! Since I purchased the cable, the ad has been revised and the V551 is no longer listed as working with this cable. Cable is of no use to me whatsoever because of the misleading ad!"
4,just get one.,"this is an old product for an old phone, but if you have one of the compatible model phones just get this. it works like a champ, sees thecomputer instantly and does what it's supposed to do. i left off the last star because i had to ge to the 'net and get the software myself. this shoild not be a problem for anyone who's ever used, say, a printer. it's the same deal. then download P2K and have at customizing the pants off your phone."
4,Well made product,Another well made product from Droll Yankee. The hangar clip locks on to the feeder to prevent mishaps due to squirrels and wind. The product is made of heavy duty powder coated steel which will last for years. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the double arm mount has some play in it when attached to the pole. Not really an issue but not perfect.
2,Not much to expect,"Draws the attention of every person that comes to my house...But it's a ''turn page book'' with nothing much to give. I had expected much more art filled passionate photographs, but didn't like it. Looked at it only maybe twice. Well it's a matter of taste I guess."
3,It's a do it yourself key chain,This is an acrylic add your own photo keychain. Seller has simply placed a Mraz photo. Nothing special.Will probably remove and replace with my own photo
1,Inaccurate and thus useless,"I purchased this at a big box store, about 45 miles away from my home. I noticed it measured different than my stanley tape on a project, so I checked the accuracy. The measuring scale is off at least 3/32 or 7/64, a critical error in measuring for furniture making or trim carpentry. Checked the scale with a stanley tape, lufkin tape, and the standard, a starrett combination square ruler blade. The tapes were within 1/64 of the starrett, which is acceptable for a tape, but the Johnson was much more inaccurate. Johnson needs better quality control, and a concern for accuracy. Now I have to wait when I go back to this town to return it to this big box company."
5,Become the ultimate baseball fan.,"Ready to go to the next level of baseball fandom? This book fills in the gaps of what you already know (or what you THINK you already know) and what you really want to know about the game. A great comprehensive guide including essential strategy and terminology. Clearly stated with nice graphics and an index, as well as relevant anecdotes and photos to illustrate points."
2,Too simplistic even for a novice fan,This book is not for anyone with a basic knowledge of baseball.
3,"When they say Inland Northwest, they ain't kidding","I anticipated the book being about hikes in the Eastern Washington area. The book however covers not only Eastern Washington but also delves into Montana, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia. That isn't an inherantly bad thing, but if you're looking specifically for Eastern Washington hikes this might not be the tome to purchase."
2,"Once a good source of information, now out of date","This book is a once noble effort that is now in dire need of an update. The Mountaineers '100 Hikes' series is usually a good bet for information in the NW USA, but in this case you'll have to do your own sniffing around to get up to date information. The book is useful, if only to give you some good ideas of the options available in this area."
3,decent ...,"Details use of geotextiles, geogrids and geomembranes using typical design applications for each ... Useful for those who would like to obtain a general understanding of geosythetic design and construction... Each chapter covers a different application: from design methods, material selection to specifications, costs considerations , inspection and construction procedures. Each chapter makes use of a design example to illustrate the chapter. I haven't come across too many texts which cover a broad range of geosynthetic applications and do it well. Some chapters seem a bit weak ... Koerner's Designing with geosynthetics is similar in that regards, although i liked this text's more detailed design examples than Koerner's...."
2,Where has all the evil gone?,"Even though the box says this doll is modeled after the evil Krusty in ""Treehouse of Horror"" I was disappointed to find just the typically amoral Krusty, more like the normal everyday Krusty doll Bart plays with.No good, no evil. None of the rage, enmity, vulgarity or diabolical death threats from ""Clown Without Pity"" which I expected.This is the doll that chased Homer with a butcher knife? Not even close. Krusty has sold out yet again.B.T.W. You'll need a butcher knife to get this sucker out of the box. If you want to save the box in good condition, leave the toy inside. You can pull the talk string from the top of the box and hear all the good/evil comments because the switch is set to ""demo"", or random, mode. Good luck trying to tell which comments are good and which are evil."
5,About (...) time!!!,"Now tell me this was not the toy you have been waiting for since the announcement of the release of the Simpsons Universe!!! How can anyone not like Krusty the drunk, gambling, porn viewing, Bozo spoof, clown? Probably one of the coolest toys ever created since....Well in some great time. Coming from one of the funniest episodes of the Simpsons, you'll be able to recreate scenes with your Evil/Good Krusty doll!Free frozen yogurt and topping not included. Only curse to come with this toy, is being cursed to have fun if you buy it!"
5,Beginner,"I am just starting to learn how to quilt. I have wanted to ""just do it"" for a while. I stumbled upon this book looking for a couple of others I had checked out of the Library. Until I got the book I didnt realize how much math is involved in making a quilt, I am glad I bought it, because it explains how many different measured blocks you would need to make specific size quilts. I have found it very informative."
5,Must Have for Quilters,All the measurements you need in one place and can find quickly. There are many reference books on the market but this is one every quilter should have in their library.
5,Quilter's Reference,"Easy step by step guidlines, easy to use, great tool. Very easy to read and get around in. Would recomend to all."
3,Fast service,Fast Service. This item was received on date stated. Will definitely be helpful in the future. Very interesting information found inside. Recommended
5,Shoulda bought it sooner,"This was actually purchased as a gift for my mother who is a beginner quilter. I should have purchased it for her sooner. She has struggeled through two quilts and could have used this invaluable resource sooner. Well, better late than never. It has everything she needs to decipher sometimes cryptic directions for a newbie. Will be purchasing another one for myself to help me in my venture into quilting."
5,Quilter's Reference,I choose this book after seeing another quilter using it. So far I have not used it very much but I'm sure I will.
4,Great Reference,"New to quilting, this reference guide is ideal! I showed it to a friend of mine who is an advanced seamtress and she is going to order today!"
5,This was used for a Native American theme at our preschool,"Needed some simple songs for the preschoolers to learn and make up a dance for. We made vests, leg bells and boys wore a feather and girls carried a feather."
1,Not even worth ONE star,"This is the most difficult product I've ever tried to deal with. And I'm technical minded. After over an hour of going through the same steps over and over, it would not configure. So at this point, I decide to give tech. support a call. On hold forever. And ever. Then, the rudest person came on the phone and told me to unplug this thing, wait five min, and try again. What the crap is that? If that is the only cracker jack advice you can give, GO OUT OF BUSINESS. When I said ""I think I'll return the product"" she said, ""ok"" and hung up on me. Simple as this: they didn't want to talk, so they give you crappy advice for a crappy product. PERIOD. If you buy this, you're a FOOL."
1,Garbage,"I wish there was a ZERO STAR selection. I am on my second unit, and both do the same thing: reboot whenever they feel like it.When I was on the phone with tech support getting an RMA for the first unit, it rebooted over two dozen times in 20 minutes. I just got the replacement unit installed today, and 30 minutes later it was rebooting.I have removed it and reinstalled my older DI-614+I have seen many posts on various sites across the Internet from people who have the same problem. Avoid the DI-624!!!"
3,Good idea badly written,"The book has a lot of promise but was poorly written. The explanation of how to actually implement the program was fairly short, took up a very small section of the book, and was incomplete"
2,not what i expected,"i did this program in highschool. its a great program. i think the book is trying to sell the program, than give the program."
3,"good quality, but......","Quality is great, but it is too bulky for such a small blade in my opinion. In fact, it sits in a drawer forgotten most of the time."
1,Avoid like the plague...,"I give this one star only because I cannot give it zero stars. I had the exact same experience with this product as another reviewer, in that when I filled it up it immediately starting leaking out of the bottom. As the other reviewer said, ""The bottom section was just two pieces pressed together and did not have a tight seal."" Amazon refunded my money, so all is good. But, I would highly recommend that you avoid this hummingbird feeder like the plague. I later bought a pretty glass one at Lowe's which I am very happy with; it looks classy and does not leak...not even a little."
2,Mediocre,"I received the feeder in the mail, filled it up and it immediately starting leaking out of the bottom. The bottom section was just two pieces pressed together and did not have a tight seal. I was able to slightly melt the two halves back together but others might not appreciate having to modify the feeder just to make it leak proof."
3,Attractive,"It's an attractive humming bird feeder. I immediately loved it after hanging in our patio. However, I sometimes notice that the nectar leaks from the base. I tried tightening the base but it did not fix it.Other than the leaking problem I am happy with it."
4,Hummingbird feeder,"Product as advertised, and delivered promptly. You can't find them cheaper than right here.Hummingbird Feeder - 0.5"" X 0.5"" X 1"" - Red"
1,i hate this bottle,"I hate this bottle, i just use it three times, but this bottle make me in the trouble, the cover is break. and it doesn't like thermos product.I hate this bottle."
2,Doesn't keep liquids hot,"Before work I fill this with coffee that, at the time that I cap it, is too hot to drink. I also do the ""pre-warm"" thing while the coffee brews, i.e., letting hot water sit in the container to warm the metal or whatever, as recommended. When I get to work 60-90 minutes later, my coffee is lukewarm. Drinkable, but barely. Kind of gross."
1,be careful of the model#,this is the second thermocafe i purchased. The first one was GREAT. it keeps coffee or tea hot for 12 hours it was a DF2150TR16. This one the DF2150 doesn't even keep my coffee/tea hot until lunchtime.. and yes I pre heat the thermos before filling. My work hours are 930 to 530 so I fill this at about 830 and by 1230 the contents aren't even lukewarm. Either this one is a knockoff or those last letters in the model # make a difference. I am purchasing another let's hope the next one is like the first one. They are a little tough to keep the inside clean after many months of coffee use.
1,Terrible product,This item was described as a Thermos brand item and instead i was shipped a knock off. It could not keep coffee hot at all. Coffee was cold within a 1/2 hour.
1,NOT a Thermos Brand Product,"the 17 oz Thermos DF2150 thermos for sale by ""Just Deals Online"" is advertised as a Thermos brand product but i got sent a thermos made by a DIFFERENT manufacturer. this was confirmed by the real Thermos Co. when i sent mine back for a replacement (because the one i got was also defective). i spoke to Amazon.com about it, they did give me a refund but this product is still for sale, still being advertised as a Thermos brand, and it is not. that's called bait & switch, and it's ILLEGAL (Amazon, why haven't you done anything to change the ad?)i tried contacting ""Just Deals"" today to see about getting what i originally ordered (since i still don't have a thermos, & i'm really not happy about all the trouble and aggravation i've had to go thru), but there is no contact info available for this company."
1,Terrible bottle - not a Thermos!,"I too made the mistake of ordering this without reading reviews. As mentioned by others, this is not a Thermos brand bottle! But it looked like what I wanted, so I gave it a try. It only holds about 10oz (not 17), and after having coffee in it for 45 minutes, the bottle was rusting on inside and on the outside where moisture got into the cap. Do not buy this!!"
1,Not working!,"The thermal bottle is not working! Boiled water gets cold within a couple of hours! It's leaking too, though only a few drops of water coming out of the bottle when I inversed it! Not recommend for anyone!"
1,Wouldn't buy it again...,"Disappointing quality from Thermos... I had purchased this as a replacement to my leaking Copco briefcase thermos/bottle, but now I have to make the choice between leaks and cold coffee. My Copco, which was purchased at Walmart, had a push-button style lid that inevitably resulted in leaks, but at least it kept my coffee hot for 4-6 hours (even after I discovered the leak). I like the twist style lid/cap on this thermos, but it doesn't even seem to keep liquids hot for more than 20-30 minutes before the temperature begins to drop. My travel mug works better than this. I use this everyday, and nothing has helped maintain temperature. I'll be looking for a better quality product.Publix also sells this thermos for almost the same price (locally). If I purchased this locally, I would have promptly returned it."
5,from one to another,"I have battled with my own depression and along the way I found this book, and I found it very helpful. If you know someone who is fighting their own battle, this book can help them too. It's not an answer or any kind of a cure, it is just a statement of love, hope and understanding from one soul to another. It's hard to say how much just knowing someone else understands, that someone else has been there and survived, can help."
2,"Decent film, poor reproduction","I purchased this to replace a VHS version thinking the DVD would look better on my larger screen. This ""remastered edition"" makes me wonder, remastered from what? Other than being able to skip around the film, this DVD is no better visually than my old VHS tape. The story is good and the performances aren't too bad but I wish there were a better version of Horror Express out there. For a plot synopsis please go elsewhere."
1,A VERY BAD PURCHASE,"I CAN NOT GIVE THIS PURCHASE A REVIEW BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WORTH WHAT I PAID FORIT . IT HAS BEEN RETURNED AND I HOPE TO GET A FULL REFUND THIS SELLER SHOULD BELOOKED INTO , IF TURNS OUT TO BE A BAD DEAL IT WILL BE MY LAST TIME SHOPPINGWITH YOU , SORRY BUT THATS THE WAY I FEEL."
4,A reference,"Plastic covers are quite stiff and make initial use of pages near them difficult.Blue headwords are a nice touch.It is a handy reference for its size. The choice of what words NOT to include is puzzling at times, as a review of countries will show.All in all a good value for the money and size."
1,New Standard Dictionary Turkish-Langenscheidt,"I was trying to translate small text from a Turk--found it impossible with this dictionary, the phrases and words were not in this dictionary."
1,Inaccurate,First they say Jews have been around 4000 years. Then they say 3000 years. Try 5771 years and counting folks. There are so many mistakes that I'm shocked this is not made to blur the lines of truth in order to fill people's heads with lies to further make Jews into something they are not. Lie after lie. So many inaccuracies I cannot stand it! NO this is not a good film to educate people about the Jews.
5,BEST movie of 2006,"Don't let the awful coverjacket fool you, this is the best movie of 2006. All eyes were on Brokeback Mountain, another great film, but this is the Heath Ledger movie to watch -- and see what a great actor he is creating a totally different performance in the same year.Any comparisons to shakespeare in love is ludicrous, this movie is so much better. A great romantic comedy, a great comedy and a great movie period.This movie is fun, heartwarming and hilarious. I was completely surprised at how good this movie is and you will be too. I've seen over a 100 movies last year and this tops my list."
3,I had more fun than I expected,"Casanova is a light-hearted farce and meant to be satirical. The plot doesn't make much logical sense, but that doesn't prevent the movie from giving you a fun romp through 18th century Venice. This is definitely a girlie flick or date movie. Don't expect to gain too much insight into Casanova's character. If you suspend all belief in the plot, expect a few easy laughs and a feel-good feeling when you leave the theater. There are some awkward and flat moments, and, like Chinese food, you'll soon feel hungry for meatier fare, but I felt I got my $8 worth. Jeremy Irons' and Oliver Platt's performances were worth every single penny."
4,Heath's Heights,"Casanova is an enjoyable film. Alot of fun and very entertaining. Everyone involved are terrific. I love Heath Ledger as Casanova. I think its so great that he has two very different movies out on dvd ( Brokeback Mountain & Casanova ) that showcase his talents and versatility. I enjoy him in light farce just as much as in drama. Casanova is a delight to add to Mr.Ledger's filmography and definitely to all Heath Ledger admirers, such as myself. :)"
4,Light Farce!,"There have been many film versions of the legend and myth of Casanova. Supposedly the world greatest seducer of women.Most of them being done in a comedic vein. I can't rememberif a truly serious movie about his life was ever made.This new version seems to fall into the same catagory.Light farce, similar to such movies as Tom Jones and Fanny Hill.Overall the movie is quite amusing, Especially Oliver Platt.His performance is worth the price of admission!Heath Ledger's performance was good. But comedic acting is somewhat harder to perform than straight drama. Pehaps with a few more such roles, he will be able to blend into comedy as deftly and smoothly as Cary Grant was able to do.In all Casanova is a pleasent movie. Visualy elegant and muchmuch better to watch than some tired and overdone version of Jane Austen's Foolish Pride and Utter Stupitidy!"
4,cute,"Heath Ledger is an AWESOME actor. Jeremy Irons did a mediocre job. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and funny. The ending is somewhat disappointing... (script & plot could definitely have been more polished )"
1,Awful,I couldn't finish this movie. It was awful. I usually love any romance movie especially if Heath Ledger is in it. Not this time!!!
4,Ok,So I'm sure this movie is great but one minute and 10 seconds into it the picture got all jumbled and all I could do is hear the audio. Disappointing because I paid to watch this and really want to see it. :(
2,Movie Okay/Manufacturing Shoddy,"I don't know from whence Amazon gets it ""duped one too many times"" copies of movies (this one said ""Hecho en México""), but this one freezes up every 5 minutes or so. With a little fanagling, you can get it moving again... and you only miss a little of the scene it froze on... I think..."
1,Auurg.,"The only problem with this item is that it hasn't arrived yet. Online tracking says it was delivered two days ago, but for some reason I still don't have it. I have seen the movie before, however, and it is a good one :)"
4,"Good movie, ugly poster.","In general, this is a good movie,good actors,but the cover or poster is ugly.I hadn't watched the movie,because the cover didn't invite me to watch it..I don't know if in that time they had sunglasses,maybe or maybe not. Good movie, have to watch."
3,a fictional Casanova,"At the dawn of an enlightened age the legend of Casanovais somewhat twisted by this happy ending romantic comedy.The period costumes are very good and the acting is well done,but like all such romantic rewrites much of the plot seemspretty hard to believe? For example, Casanova is rescued from the churchwho is about to hang him by his mother the actress and herfriend the actor. The leading lady is a fem-lib writerwell before such texts saw the light of day, becausethe church backed the family as headed by menand women had nearly zero rights in an court.The antics of Casanova with his womanizing madee him somewhat of a hero in histime to many of male population.I think that rewriting history for a romantic happy endingis probably good for Hollywood and bad for history?"
3,Funny and witty,"There are some funny and witty parts to the movie. The beginning and ending are interesting and a bit unexpected, I feel."
2,"Oh, Heath, why do you do such trash?","Casanova is a beautiful film that happens to be a waste of a bright young talent. Take Heath Ledger in any of his other decent films--Monster's Ball,10 Things I Hate About You, orA Knight's Tale (Special Edition)--and forget that he did the rest of this garbage. It's hard to review a Heath Ledger film since his death without going into sentimental emotionalism, but Casanova is not a film worthy of him.Here are the highlights of Casanova:Heath Ledger, Venice, the photography, and some humor.Here are the problems with Casanova: the silly plot about the church and its moralism and the gross historical inaccuracies.If you can overlook those problems and just want to watch a beautiful film that makes you want to go to Venice, than watch Casanova. But if you want a good movie, you will have to look elsewhere."
2,Where is Johnny Depp when you need him?,"The star of the film is Venice, dialog and role portrayal predictable. Costumes were great but it takes more then clothing to make a believable leading man, oh and the heroine was plain old vanilla, so if you have a choice see something else"
2,"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly","The Good: Sienna Miller and Lena Olin as Francesca Bruni and her Mother Andrea Bruni. Charming!The Bad: Jeremy Irons as Pucci, the Grand Inquisitor. He is totally miscast in this role.The Ugly: Oliver Platt (Paprizzio) with his shirt off and Heath Ledger dressed as a Venetian fop in a powdered white wig, lace and ruffles. It just doesn't work.'Casanova' is OK (maybe) for one viewing and that's primarily because of the many lovely ladies cavorting about in amorous pursuit of the legendary lover."
1,A very slight entertainment,"I had read reviews that stated this movie to be not half-bad. Well, take the half off, because this ""Casanova"" is simply stupid. Heath Ledger doesn't know what to do with this watered-down part and the leading lady whose name I do not want to remember gives a stilted and lackluster performance, if you can even call it that.One reviewer said that the script had some help from Tom Stoppard, but I don't believe it for one minute. And the cinematography is so bad that it makes the real Venice look like a cardboard set.$29.00! This DVD isn't worth 29 cents!Try and find a copy of Felini's Casanova. It's long overdue to be on DVD."
2,Boredom,"Generally a waste of time and money, though Lasse Hallstrom's (""Chocolat"") ""Casanova"" has two things going for it: Heath Ledger's free-wheeling performance as the big C and the undeniably gorgeous vistas of Venice. Other than that, the premise is vapid, the film lacks a soul and despite Ledger's performance and a so-so one by Sienna Miller (the sexy blond from ""Layer Cake,"" who has to endure being a brunette here) a royal bore."
5,Basic Love,This is the most basic and necessary example that our Lord taught by His life and teaching on this earth and it seems to be the last thing most Christians learn before they die.
5,The Most Powerful Prayer On Earth by Peter Horrobin,I recommend this book to everyone. You will learn a lot.Your way of living should be better after reading it.It should make you a better person. It really helped me. I loved the book.
4,Better than average for this Genre,"I have several movies like this one, about the murders of women in Mexico along the Bordertown of Juarez. The theme is unsettling, and many movies like this one are poor ripoffs of the Genre, or the situation. This is better done, and the acting is better."
5,Well-crafted film portrays the rampant femicide in Ciudad Juarez.,"I was quite unprepared for this powerful, graphic and extremely disturbing film about life (and death!) in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a town right across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas. It is a very well-produced and directed film, hitting all the right notes with a fine cast, screenplay, cinematography, and score. It depicts and seeks to explain the true and tragic story of an epidemic in Ciudad Juarez of ""femicide"" - the using and disposing of women as if they were objects of consumption. It made a lasting impact upon me as I'm sure it will upon every viewer, reminding us that crimes against women are not limited to just one Mexican border town..."
4,Good ideas,"My father talked about this book, and I was interested enough to buy it. It has as much life advice and optimism, as it does farming know how. Living in Florida, the farming discussion should be taken with a grain of salt, as the author writes about experience in England."
3,farming for self sufficieincy,"The book was used, but so used that every page i turned fell out. I did not get to read very much of it because the pages just kept coming out."
2,Not for me.,"I found that I am not a fan of flavored green teas. Give me the straight stuff. The green tea with jasmine is my favorite flavor in this assortment. I bought this because I tasted LF&H; Chamomile tea with honey and loved it but could not find it on the internet. I thought I might like some of their green teas. It didn't work out. I got so depressed I climbed out on the window ledge and jumped. Since I'm on the ground floor, it wasn't enough and all I got was grass stains on my good pants.Hopeless in Houston,Mike"
5,Great Flavor,"Each of the London Fruit & Herb (flower, actually) tea bags provides a luscious flavor and wonderful aroma. Great for the chilly fall and winter days. The four flavors are Peach, Orange, Raspberry and Jasmine."
2,Morgan 100 NOT OUT,"Had the potential to be a great vid, but poorly edited with wrong images matched to dialogue and over use of the same images.Great interview with Mathew Parkin who told us more in a more concise way than the vague v/o. Presenter good, but direction lazy and vid too long for the amount of quality footage shot.A pity it was not given a good sub-editing and mistakes corrected."
2,Frustrating,"At first glance, this is a 5-star book. A wonderful map and full-color photos make it visually appealing.The book is organized by geology: How are standing rocks formed? Where can you find gemstones? What geological conditions produce canyons? Are there any volcanic formations nearby? Where have they found fossils? If I were doing a report on a type of geological formation, this would be a great book to have. But I'm not -- I'm using the book to look at the natural wonders of the southwest and trying to decide where to take my family on the next four-day weekend.This book, being chopped up by types of rocks (to put it simply) is annoying because you can not use it to quickly find amazing photos of Zion National Park, for example. Information you want is scattered among several chapters.It's beautiful, but not useful."
2,Good Player with NO Battery Life,"This is a great MP3/CD Player, don't get me wrong. It has excellent sound, easy navigation, and even an AM/FM radio. But the battery life is HORRIBLE. My batteries barely lasted 1 day (one hour to work, one hour home). I cannot replace batteries every day, or even every other day. I will be returning this model for something else."
4,review on shoes,"I love the look and feel of the shoe... however, the leather is incrediably hard and stiff... allowing the shoe to rub on the ankle. I have several shoes, very similar,.. this is the only one that is so stiff and uncomfortable to walk in after several hours... but I'll keep trying to break them in."
2,Rough harmony and timing,"I love Sacred Harp music and own five CDs of it. I listen to this music frequently. It's appeal to me is its beautiful harmonies and strong feeling.The singing on this CD has real feeling but often the harmonies and timing are very rough and not pleasing to my ear. I will listen to it very little, if at all, in the next year. I regret not buying a different Sacred Harp CD instead."
1,Fake Sacred Harp Music,I do not understand why the title suggests the music is Sacred Harp when the style is something entirely different and not traditional. A couple of people wrote all the songs and the singing wasn't at all interesting. Save your $$ for true Sacred Harp Music from the Sacred Harp official book. I'm getting rid of my copy.
4,A textbook of challenging 'new age'information,"Content is 5 stars.Slow reading due to presentation.I would have preferred to have terms defined, better and material presented in more simple terms. Words she is VERY fond of,like 'positionality',and holigram, left me wondering how she definded them.There is dictionary of terms in the back, but it was of only limited use.She makes you work for the information, on this book, but it's worth the effort."
5,Ecstacy is a New Frequency: Teachings of the Light Institute,"I got this book because I want to learn about living a life of joy and ecstacy. This book is teaching me just what I hoped. I'm able to dial into the feelings (vibrations) of ecstasy, bliss, joy...and live them more and more consistently. I'm glad I have this book."
4,Hermetic Symbolism,"This book is totally not what I was expecting. Saint-Germain uses very deep and real symbols and correspondences to communicate that which can only be communicated through this means, and only with great care and understanding. To those who overlook this, as a previous reviewer who seemed to think that ""spiritual works"" should be more simplistic and literal, the only possibility is that they must be missing out on a lot. Even though this book is very short, it must be very carefully analyzed. A good working knowledge of Astrology, Alchemy, Kabbalah, Neoplatonism and Hermetica is recommended. Manly P. Hall's introductory writings are also really a fascinating read, and while I am open to even the most extreme possibilities, from experience I tend to take some of his information with a grain of salt and would like to see some evidence to back them up. I think this text may also shed some light on the development of the various rites of Egyptian Freemasonry."
2,Paranoia or a Medieval Men's Club,"This treatise is so full of allegorical allusions that I doubt anyone's expertise to fully interpret it and I found the reading for the most part to be disappointing. I think the Godfrey Ray King books are much more interesting and insightful. In some ways it reminded me of an Alice in Wonderland journey. In my opinion, if you are looking for insight, this book will not be that need fulfilling-the Masters of the Far East series might be a better read. The most informative section is Hall's analysis.In short it was not a good read for me."
2,Paranoia or A Medieval Men's Club,"This treatise is too well disguised to trust anyone's interpretation. It reminds me of someone interpreting Alice in Wonderland. I think there many better spiritual resources. For this reader, the book proved to be a disappointment."
2,his and hers,"I was dissapointed when I received the blankets. They were not as big as I thought, nor as thick. It is a cute idea but I wish I would have held off for a better blanket."
4,For the Harley Fans...,"Arrived after Christmas...my fault...but took longer for the shipping than I anticipated. Packaged nicely, was a big hit with the his and hers throws for a pair of Harley rider friends of mine. If you are looking for a fairly inexpensive Harley gift and love the soft feel of these throws...this is a decent gift."
3,not so hot,"I bought this for the HDTV QAM tuner (the one that enables you to pull hi def signals off the cable). Unfortuntaly that part of the set does not work (YET). Samsung promised a fix, but it did not ship so I elected to return it (from the ""Samsung' repair shop where I toook it straight from Circuit city after I bought it). THe repair shop / SAMSUNG said 7 days, then gave no ETD for the part and then made me pay a fee of $25.00 (for nothing except lying about it) so i could return it to Circuit city within one day of the 30 days) when I returned to Circuit city they would not refund the 32 dollars ""Discount"" I got but rather gave me gift card credit. Nice touch. Non working TV - wait one month- out $57.00! Boo. worked OK on analog did a lousy job stretching. Bought a sanyo instead. no hassles! works nice as it should."
2,"Good picture, good price, died after 26 months",I liked everything about this set until it stopped working - completely- 2 months after the warrantee ran out
2,"Amazing picture, great price, dead in less than 2 years","I woke up New Year's morning and turned on the TV: it clicked and turned high intensity green, rendering the TV useless. I brought it to a Samsung recommended service center, and the quote for repair is $483. I was extremely satisfied with the TV while it worked, however I'm going to save the repair money and buy from a more reliable manufacturer."
2,"""Eagle USA"" shipping disappoints","The first of these sets that shipped via ""Eagle USA"" had been damaged inside the carton (the carton looked O.K. from the outside, so I signed for it.) - But the set had obviously been dropped, resulting in a cracked circuit board and a blown picture tube.To be fair, Amazon is cross-shipping a replacement set, but the shipper, again ""Eagle USA"", has listed a tracking number for this replacement that shows some prior shipment delivered (somewhere) last July (it is now November). So I don't even know how to track the replacement set.These guys are not in the same league as FedEx, UPS or DHL. If you can avoid using ""Eagle USA"" for shipping this set, I'd recommend that you do so."
2,The Three Stooges Collection,"Where's Curly? If your looking for the Stooges you know and love this isn't it. There's a reason Ted Healy was cut from the Stooges. In this video there is a lot of singing and dancing,but not alot of the three stooges."
3,It's ok...,I thought that it had pretty simple information which is nice but it wasn't any additional information that I hadn't picked up from classes/other mothers and other books. I felt like it was just a collection of other books. I didn't really get much from it.
5,Best photos of good latch,"I have used this book for years in my OB/GYN practice to show pregnant mom's what breastfeeding is supposed to look like. The photos have really helped the mother whose previous experience was painful to see what a good latch is and, just as importantly, is NOT. This book doesn't replace learning from real breastfeeding mothers, like at La Leche League meetings, but the photos and information are superior to other books for showing you how to breastfeed."
5,My favorite breastfeeding book! (and I have lots),"Breastfeeding is a learned skill. I think reading this book while still pregnant is one of the best things a mom can do to have a good breastfeeding experience. It doesn't always come naturally, and it's not always easy right away, and this book is the best source of problem-solving information and advice that I have seen. It is very practical, and does the best job of showing how Not to do it to help us figure out how To do it. I think that's the key- helping moms get through any problems that come up, because it's so worth it! I'm so glad I had this book (along with great family support), and I'm so glad I nursed my daughter!"
1,Pumps Not Discussed,"You would think a book of this length, entirely on breastfeeding, would discuss the use of pumps. However, the author wrote they do not discuss pumps because there are other books that do. Apparently they want you to go buy another book specifically on pumping. Hand expression is discussed because ""it doesn't cost anything"". I found the book to be very informative on how to breastfeed and the illustrations are very helpful, but that doesn't help me when I return to work!"
3,Unknown,I gave this on a 3 cause I received a book that answered all my questions. I only skimmed through this book and it looks to have a lot of the same information in it as most of the other books.
2,"EH, it was ok.","I decided I wanted to breastfeed my child when she was born, so I thought I would get a bit of information. My mother gave me some advice, my mother-in-law gave me some advice and a few friends gave me their insight. I found this book to be redundant and not any more informative than my mother's advice. Given, she is a maternal and child health care worker, but still, I expected more from this book. I only picked it up once or twice. I suffered from mastitis, and my daughter developed some late 'nipple confusion', and the book didn't give me any new help, that my mom couldn't give me. I would honestly choose Kathleen Huggins' book next time."
5,I researched them all - this one's THE BEST,"I felt so overwhelmed when my son was born, that I checked out all the recommended books on breastfeeding provided by the hospital (15 of them). This one was the best: it was clear, it was helpful, and it provided truly useful advice. The pictures & photos with the right & wrong way to do things are awesome. Helped me have confidence!"
2,"Hamelin, Hough, Hayroudinov...How about it?","Not meaning to plagiarize Mark Twain, but... This music is better than it sounds. These are hopelessly pedestrian readings of a rather pedestrian composer who nonetheless knew his craft and is worth investigating, especially if you're interested in the nineteenth-century Germanic phase of the development of classical music in America. Needed is a pianist of imagination and the technique to back it up; one of the above gentlemen, or any of a large number of others, would do nicely. This recording is going cheap enough, as it ought to, so by all means satisfy your curiosity, then hope for something better."
5,Flyleaf flies high.,"Flyleaf shows why they have consistency on the Billboard Album chart. Every song shows a passion that Lacey and the others have for the music. My favorites are ""All Around Me"" and ""Cassie"". I really love the acoustic version of ""Cassie"". Flyleaf displays their musical prowess by supplying acoustic versions of ""Fully Alive"", ""Red Sam"", ""Cassie"", ""I'm so sick"", and ""All around me"". If you haven't picked up this CD, pick it up. It is worth the money."
4,Pretty good...could be better,"I was completely mesmerized by the lead singer's ethereal voice, and after I saw the videos (especially for ""All around me"") I had to buy this album. It is overall pretty good (certainly the hits are great) but it does have its weak spots. However its persistence on the charts shows that even those lows are higher than many other band's highs. I would recommend it highly. A good group of fellow Texans who did well."
5,Flyleaf Rocks!!!,"I purchased this cd/dvd Flyleaf album as a gift to my girlfriend, and she was very happy, this group is good.i give 5 stars."
4,Grown up Paramore,"Distinctive, powerful and melodious. I heard some of their tracks on WJRR whilst on holiday in Florida and was deermined to buy the album when I returned home. The combination of Lacey Moseley's of heart rending vocal tones and Sameer Bhattarcharaya's and Jared Hartmann's dufferentiated but complimentary guitar work lift the album out of the ordinary."
5,fantastic,"i dont usually like bands as much with female lead singers, but this one is GREAT. she does a great job and the whole cd rocks from start to finish. the cd isnt over produced like alot of music these days so if you saw them in concert they would live up to your expectations and more."
5,Just Awesome,"I listen to this CD all the time,and I came across them by accident. I think I found them online, and downloaded a song, but I was hooked!The whole CD is awesome, and I love female rock singers. This one is upbeat, and is surely not going to disappoint those who want a feel for new rock."
3,"Great Vocals, Band lackluster","I use Tool as the measure of these new bands. Tool is the master of this genre so it seems unfair to put them against a juggarnaut.This singer surely sounds like Anvil Lavigue when see stretches her vocals. I want hold that against her though.I've seen on some of her message boards she is a born-again Christian. This doesn't really add up since she is on a massive amount of drugs. Furthermore, she has a couple of God songs, which seems to make this claim true.Christian music in a hardcore alternative genre will not produce a lot of supporters. This truism definitely makes me rate this band lower.The band is over laden with problems such as:1. Bass is almost non-existent2. Good rifts are there, yet at a minute scale3. Drums are ok, but have not much impactWith these shortcomings of the band, Lacey trumps this with her voice and what she has been through. I feel this is an OK album, but I don't see much of a future on their upcoming albums."
1,DO NOT WANT,"I'm willing to admit ""Cassie"" is a decent song. However, the album as a whole I hope I never hear again. I had a friend who would play this cd while I was in the car so thankfully I never wasted money on it. Lacey's voice is powerful which is great but would sound a whole lot better if she didn't use it.A lot of reviews seem to praise the song ""I'm So Sick"". It uses a very simple, repetitive melody which some bands can pull off but it doesn't work here. The same four notes stick in my head for hours along with Lacey's whiny voice miraculously getting more and more annoying each time. It sickens me that so many other listeners think this is good music."
2,"two words ""bad chemistry""","i listend to the bands single ""i am so sick"" and i noticed a great scream, then a lovely sound by the vocalist Lacey Mosley who by the way has a really nice voice... but thats it !drummings are really weak and so does the bass, the guitars are not too good but fair.the music is weak, for instance every song probably last less than 3 minutes, what kind of band is this ??every song sounds the same. lacey has a great talent which is yet not to its fullest and she's wasting it on a weak written music. her voice are lyrics are natural.i do not recommend you to buy it, yet i do recommend to download it and hear lacey in the song ""i am sorry"" which i think she did the best in. thats all"
1,I slept half way through...,"I hope and pray the next Evanescence CD flops, so that we can stop seeing bands as obnoxiously bad as this surfacing. Nothing original, nothing intelligent, quite simply nothing great about this album. Personally I would rather have freshly sharpened pencils jabbed into my ears than to ever have to listen to this girls voice ever again.Save yourself $12, don't but this."
4,good debut,This is a good debut album. Most of the songs are catchy and have good music. The price of the cd is good too. Despite what some people (incubus1) may say lacey's voice is similar to Avril Lavigne's. I wouldn't compare this album to Evanescence (who by the way do not get boring). The music isn't really similar nor are the vocals.
5,Worth it for the videos alone.,"My friend Melissa got me into Flyleaf just recently. Man have i been missing out!i absolutly love All Around Me and Sorrow, but the rest of the CD is worth a listen too. I also like There for you and Fully Alive. very powerful songs, with lyrics that arent just any old lyrics, you actually feel the emotions in these songs. Plus there are acoustic versions, a definete must.The dvd includes footage of the performances as well as the videos for I'M So Sick,Fully Alive and All Around Me. the videos are awesome. You like Flyleaf, get this!"
5,A Music Masterpiece,Flyleaf's music is just amazing. I can listen to any of their songs and just feel great. This re-release of their debut album includes great acoustic versions of some of their music. You also get a dvd with some live performances and a free cell ringtone. A great package for those who already bought and those who haven't bought the original release.
5,flyleaf,"after stubbling upon this band on youtube, I look to amazon to aquire the music. I find this metal band refreshing. If you like flyleaf, then I would suggest lacuna coil, within temptations and fireflight as a look see."
4,Rockin out,"Flyleaf knows how to rock out on this disc. They also know how to tone it down. I like the extra acoustic versions; it shows their skills and focuses on the message of the song. The videos on the DVD let you see who the band is. Overall, a great band with a great message in their songs."
4,Cool CD,"This is a pretty cool cd! It's all rock and a little bit of screaming, plus theres some cool acoustic songs at the end of the cd! The riffs are catchy as well as the lyrics! You will definetly get into it and be movin to the beat! I would say they will play this CD on the classic stations 20-30 years from now! haha! Get this cd!"
4,Good CD,"I got the Flyleaf EP and after hearing that I wanted to get the CD. The songs are changed a lot from EP, but still good. At first they sounded worse since they had lot of added effects or such to the song. After getting use to them I ended up preferring the versions on this cd, but still would recommend for people who liked this cd (I would recommend even more if you sorta liked band) to get EP since it has different sound. The lyrics change a lot between some EP and normal versions off the songs, mainly I'm So Sick. The acoustics also change lyrics a bit, mainly Cassie. it's a good CD with lot of nice sounds, but many have a religious reference (some very directly)."
3,A Strong Debut,"You've got to love Lacey Mosley's voice. As the diminutive frontwoman of Flyleaf, Mosley's vocal range is anything but. She can wail with the best rock frontmen, blasting out lyrics of anger and confusion, and then quickly turn the tables and deliver something swooning and seductive. She can hold your heart in her hand tenderly. Or crush it with a single squeeze. Listen to ""All Around You"" and ""I'm So Sick"" back to back and you'll catch my drift. This eponymous debut, though plagued with many typically debut album problems, works more often than it doesn't, and showcases the group's potential."
3,Flyleaf: Don't judge a group by its video,"The video for ""I'm so sick"" grabs you, shakes you, and reminds you that the truly great rock bands are the SCARY ones.Trouble is, elsewhere on the album Flyleaf suggests that the band they'd really like to be is Evanescence."
4,Great even for mainstream,I am not typically into Christian Rock as I'm not a very spiritual person. However I still found that this album spoke to me with her powerful lyrics and voice. They definitely have some potential for both the Christian Rock scene and the mainstream scene. Hope to hear some more powerful and personal lyrics in a year or so. :)
1,I'm so sick of Lacuna Coil rip-offs!,"MeTalHeaD4Ever ""DEath"" pretty much hit the nail on the head. This sounds like Avril Lavigne and Evanescence mixed together, which isn't a good thing! The grating vocals have already been described. The lyrics are generic, nu-metal tripe. Cristina Scabbia could kill this new girl in singing and songwriting. The guitar consists of power chords and no soloing. Why have 2 guitarists if they do the same thing?! The bassist might as well just quit, since you can't hear him. The drums aren't special either.All Tracks: 0/10Avoid this garbage, and get Lacuna Coil's new CD instead."
5,Great New Band - A Sure Winner,"I was on my way to work at about 4:45 in the morning and my local rock station happened to play the first song from this album ""I'm So Sick"". I couldn't get the song out of my head the rest of the day and was haunted by the vocals just as long.A great debut CD. I have to admit the EP was a lot better as far as a raw underproduced work can be. But the CD is no waste of music, especially at the price (I got it for $7.99 new).The vocals are a wonderful mix of, dare i say it?, Rush, Incubus, Alanis Morisette, etc..The guitar could use a harder chunkier edge, the bass work is lacking, the drums are great. I think the best thing about this album is the refreshing vocals. I havent heard much lately with such an original sound as far as vocals go.Stay away from There For You- Dave Navarro is a tool."
4,"Fun vocals, heavy riffs, and lots of energy.","Flyleaf has found quite a bit of success touring with bands like Deftones. Their lead singer is female, and she is tiny at that. But don't let that turn you off. This isn't another average girl fronted metal band, like Kittie. She is able to convey so much emotion into every song it is unbelievable. It is a very solid cd. No filler. I'm excited for their next one too, because I think they have tons more potential. I mean, they've already sold over 500,000 copies of this one, which is pretty darn good. I don't think that everyone will like them, though. But if you're looking for something different as far as vocals go, try them."
2,Alright,Some of songs skip. Received NO ring. Took a bit to get here. (Flyleaf) packaging was good. Does play nice besides the few skips. I may consider ordering from there again.
3,"Good, But not Stellar","Flyleaf first caught my attention with the track, ""All Around Me"". It is my favorite track on the CD. It is good but nothing especially innovative. It is cool to see a girl at the front of a good rock band, but Evanescence already had introduced the sound. Don't get me wrong, these guys (and girl) do stand apart from Evanescence and don't sound like just another clone band. ""All Around Me"", ""Red Sam"", and ""Fully Alive"" are the stand-out tracks of the CD so if you decide you don't want the CD, but want some Flyleaf in your library, pick up those tracks. I think this band could have a bright future. I would like to see them push some boundaries and with Lacey Mosley's voice, I think they can pull of a stellar album."
5,Rock and Roll,"Simply put, Flyleaf rocks!!!!And they are Christian to boot.Fantastic music, Have not taken it out of my cd player since I received it. No foul language or profanity. Good clean rock with a message in every tune. Praise God!!!!Worth every penny!"
4,If you want a fresh new sound get this alblum,"This alblum is amazing. It sucks you in with the first song and keeps the riffs going. This is the only other band besides Evanesance that can pull off a heavy metal female lead. If you like Hawthorne Heights, Senses Fail, Evanesance or Incubus this is the alblum for you. I cannot wait to got see them live."
3,Crime antedotes in a minute,"This book is not bad. It contains some funny accounts of robberies and whatnot, but there isn't much in the way of detail. The stories just give the bare bones of what happened. Most are just one to two pages long. If you're not much of a reader, this would be a good book for you."
3,Great DVD small print,"I bought the dvd. I think that the quality of the DVD is Excellent, but the book that comes with the dvd is printed in very small, very hard to read print. the book is a small insert that comes inside the dvd. I found it nearly impossible to read the micro tabs and play the banjo. I still think Tony is the man and have just ordered his full size book."
4,Satisfied with purchase,"I ordered this item to decorate a wall in a newly remodeled office, and it catches the eye of everybody that comes into the office. The finish is more black than gold, which will not help much in a dark colored wall, but besides that I am very happy with this purchase.Product arrived well packed and without damage. Requires two persons to hang it, but it won't take long if you measure carefully and follow the directions."
5,"Homework, Baseball, and the Coleman Stove","We use the Coleman Grill Stove at my son's baseball games. During week nights with homework and all the schedule works well for families on the team to share dinner after the game. We cook hotdogs and burgers on the grill for about 30 to 40 people. The kids love it and my wife has been voted team MOM the last couple of seasons. I love the fact that cool spring evenings or cooler fall evenings we can have hot water for tea, cider, or coffee. With the burner we can not only grill but provide chili for the dogs or what have you. We use a larger white style propane tank (I think 2 gallon) and it works and takes us through a season."
5,Not my father's Coleman stove,"Sets up very easily, lights in an instant. We had bacon and eggs cooked and eaten before our motorhome friends were even out of bed. Lightweight and very convenient to use, clean and store. We also purchased the griddle and the carry/storage bag thinking the stove would be too greasy to transport after use, but this thing cleans up so nicely, you could do without its own bag. Worked great in windy situations - flame was steady & never blew out, and food stayed warm (both days of use were 10-15 mph winds) the side flaps easily accommodate a large saucepan to heat for cleaning water and arrived at usable temp in very little time. Two breakfasts on the griddle, burgers on the grill and cleaning water heated each use, barely dented a bottle of gas. Much more ease of use over the fuel-type stoves. Would purchase again - but it's a Coleman - they last for a really long time."
2,Dissatisfied customer,"Although I purchased this Coleman Grill in June 2006, today (Aug. 31, 2006), was the first time I used it. It was purchased for the sole purpose of using it during hurricane season. Ernesto was building up to be a hurricane, so I tried out my Coleman grill.I am dissatisfied as the neither one of the ignitors work, so, it has to be lit with a match. The main reason I bought this model was for the instant ignitors. Also, both burners heat at an exceptionally high flame and it is very difficult to get the flame at a low heat without it going out. And the grill is supposed to be non-stick, but the chicken really stuck to it.I didnt realize upon purchasing this through Amazon that it was NOT returnable, not even for an exchange.I am going to contact Coleman to see if they live up to their good reputation and will replace the ignitors. Otherwise, this will be the last Coleman item I buy."
2,Very poor service - not recommended,"I ordered this item and received a 4 oz. flask, rather than the 8 oz. flask that I ordered. Not only was the order filled incorrectly, it took 3 1/2 weeks to get it. I would never order from this company again."
1,HAte it the Crage Digital MP3 DONT BUY IT!!!!!,i would like a return in the MP3 player and i am mad i hate it it really bites Guys dont buy it. The audio in mine dosnt even work i only opened it put batteries checked the volume and put music in it nothing came out.so dont buy it its not fun when you dont know what your listening to. Why do you think so many pepole brought the thing back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! iam mad so dont buy it and iam 12 i understand when you get cheated ok !!!!!!
3,Get what you pay for.,I can't complain being this was a gift. It is very easy to use as an audio player or jump drive. If I were to buy myself a player I would get one with FM player\recorder & Line-In Encoding. The only problem I have found is that at low to moderate volume and in-between songs there is annoying electronics chatter. I don't know if this is normal for Craig Audio but I would prefer no background noise.
1,CMP-1003 MP3 player,give 2 for xmas gifts and now have to wait 2weeks for replacment due to both say bye bye and shuts offf the are worth less than than the 20 special pricing i paid ... TWO very un happy kids
1,This mp3 player bites,Nothing works you cant play any music i took it home and bought a few songs for it and nothing worked it cost me 60 bucks and now i think they have recalled it DONT BUY IT
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!,This thing did not work from the moment we took it out of the box. It was incredibly frustrating. I was able to take it back and get a different model and that one seems to be working just fine. My daughter was upset because she thought the pink one was so pretty. But atleast she has one that works!!
3,Just Ok,"I would recommend this unit if you're not going to do much moving of it. If you plan to buy it to use when you're exercising, I would recommend you look at other available models if you're going to use the CD player because this unit will scratch your CD or skip easily. If you're going to use the radio part, though, it will be fine."
2,re: everything but,"it does not play compressed mp3, which is what i bought it for. it plays regular cd's just fine, but so what. so does my computer."
2,Just OK....,"Weddings from the Heart was just OK...I'm planning a wedding and looking for different ideas for vows and readings - and this book just wasnt' for me. I earmarked a few pages - but not many. One book that was INCREDIBLE was ""the knot guide to weddings vows and traditions""! Great book with TONS of ideas - i earmarked a TON of pages here. I was reluctant to get it at first just b/c it was ""the knot"" - even though they are the so called ""wedding guru's""...you know....I just thought others might have other insightful advice....well, not so...trust me - save your money and just go buy the knot's guide - it was the best! (at least for me!)"
4,very helpful,This book was extremely helpful when I was planning my wedding. It has several passages for cermonies that are lovely.
3,May I Recommend an Alternative?,"As much as I typically love Daphne Rose Kingma's books, we actually foundSacred Ceremony: Create and Officiate Personalized Wedding Ceremoniesmore helpful. Both books begin by breaking down and explaining the various components of a marriage ceremony. Whereas ""Sacred Ceremony: Create and Officiate Personalized Wedding Ceremonies"" by Dayna Reid provides a whole ""mix and match"" buffet of components, though, ""Weddings from the Heart"" provides only a handfull of complete ceremonies. If you happen to be one of the four or five types of couples that Daphne Rose Kingma is targeting, you may find that one of her ceremonies speaks to you or can at least be used as a foundation for your own. None of them spoke to us."
3,"Okay, depending on what you want","Most of this book was irrelevant for what I wanted. I was looking for a source for religiously-oriented vows, prayers, and blessings which I could use to create an ecumenical wedding service. This book DOES have a section of such things --and I did find it useful for comparison purposes-- but the main emphasis is on contemporary vows, addresses, etc., most of which seemed just too fluffy for me. If you do want very emotionally-laden, ""unique to you"" and non-traditional wedding, go for this. If you seriously want to compare weddings from different Judeo-Christian traditions, I highly recommend _Weddings: A Complete Guide to All Religious and Interfaith Marriage Services_ instead."
4,A great tool for getting ideas for your ceremony,"My partner and I combed through this book learning the history and meaning of different kinds of ceremonies which really helped us as we wrote our own. I am not a specifically religious person so it was helpful learning the background behind the different parts of traditional ceremonies (invocation, vows, etc) as well as seeing how different folks (pagan, recovery) have created their own ceremonies. I actually found these sections a bit cheesy, but it was still a useful book in all."
3,Good to Mediocre Book,"Harry R. Ballinger's craft is painless to employ, once you see how its done. This is basically again a black and white book with about 6 colored plates. His approach of waves in motion gives us a better insight into the physics of waves, and how they should appear. I do like this book, but there are better publications to be had."
1,looks are deceiving,this book has a great cover but everything inside is in black and white and they're aren't many pictures but full pages of ???////!!!!it wasn't helpful
2,Ballinger,Black & white bnooks on painting do not give the true impression of what the colours are like. The few coloured pages are not really like the ocean that I have experienced.
5,Nicer than I thought it would be,"When I ordered this item, as usual, the discription left a lot to be desired. But it's really nice, well made,and very colorful. The height could be a little more, but I would recommend this to anyone."
4,great tweeter,"Really a great tweeter, I added a couple to my vintage Maggie's and they really helped with the high end, good tweeter!"
3,interesting idea but poorly written,"As one who used to work in the polling industry and is continuously frustrated by the poor methodology used in most widely-reported polls, I was intrigued by this book at the outset. Indeed, the premise is interesting, and there are many valid points to be made in its pages. However, the book is muddled in its presentation and drags on for far too many pages. Each chapter, and often each page, reads just like the previous one. The author gets an A+ for drawing attention to a serious problem in the media that hinders political debate, but he gets a D for presentation and style."
1,Compositionally disappointing,"Language on the back cover of this CD states ""Esther contains dramatically stirring music and features some of Handel's most exquisite solo writing and thrilling choruses."" It does not. It's hack work by Handel. The performers are good, but when I see names of this calibre I expect them to be associated with a more worthy project."
4,Fantastic Movie.,"An amusing crime-based comedy that runs the gauntlet of robbery, murder, blackmail, and a surprisingly amusing phonesex moment. The acting is wonderfully done, one the best roles I believe Abe Vigoda has been offered.Gérard Depardieu, Harvey Keitel, and Renaud pull off their characters flawlessly, which is saying something because they're dark characters that are injecting some serious comedy.In the end, everyone involved with this movie should definately be proud of their effort, because it's definately worth seeing."
1,This is a Great movie. Funny from begging to end!,"I love this movie and it is truly one of the funny crime capers with excellent stars. I would actually add it to my favorites list and if you have not seen it please watch it. If you're not laughing in the first two minutes something is wrong.My reason for a bad rating has nothing to do with the movie but Midwest Pawn who sold it to me as ""Like New"" and it was and old Hollywood Movie rental with several bad scratches. When I told them about it they said I was wrong. This DVD could not be watched do to the damage and a less than reputable seller. Buy this movie from someone you can trust live Movie Mars or so many others. I've been buying for years is this was my only bad experience out of hundreds of transactions!"
2,Mediocre,"I honestly don't know what people who gave this a good review are talking about. I found it unimaginative, derivative, and totally unfunny. A waste of time and money! No wonder I've never heard of it."
1,Criminally Bad - WITH FAKE 5-STAR REVIEWS,"First, be forwarned this film has lots of fake 5-star reviews posted by the filmmakers. These jokers did the same thing on netflix. There's a good reason why you can buy it for less than $1 - because it's really BAD.How to describe this film? Put the word ""bad"" in front of any component of a film, and you've got it. Bad Tarantino/Lock Stock/Get Shorty knock-off. Bad writing. Bad directing. Bad acting. Bad cinematography. Bad continuity. Bad decision for Keitel and Depardieu. Bad rental choice. I made it through about 20 minutes before I reached for the Pepto Bismol and anti-depressants. If you want a really great obscure crime comedy, try ""Big Deal on Madonna Street."""
4,"Good For Those Who ""Get It""","This movie was delivered as promised and I commend the seller. As for the movie, you have to be able to appreciate the humor as many people really do not understand it. You have to have some knowledge about the Italian Mafia."
5,One of the best,"This is one great television. It has firewire, DVI and a built in tuner. Because of the built in firwire port and tuner you will be able to record HDTV programs off of the air if you have a compatible DVHS VCR. The black marble case is beautiful. I did a lot of research on different televisions and this seemed like the most future-compatible HDTV in it's price range. Highly Recommended!"
1,waste of money,"This was a total waste of money! We bought one for our son and he wanted to give this as a birthday gift to a friend . Thank goodness we tested it before we gave the gift! It doesnt work at all. We couldn't get it to blow a single bubble, it just made a huge soapy mess and blew a lot of smoke. How dissapointing for a 7 year old to see an advertisement on tv showing what he thought would be an awesome, fun toy: only to be totally dissapointed!!!Needless to say, we returned both and opted for something else."
1,Complete waste of money,Horrible! Lots of yucky smelling smoke but will not blow more than one puny bubble at a time.
1,Horrible Disappointment!,"My mother bought this ""bubble blower"" for my daughter after she saw it on tv blowing tons of bubbles. Well, it blow lots of smoke which really smells bad, but has yet to blow ONE bubble! Save your money and invest in something that actually works to avoid the disappointed look on your child's face."
1,Read before you buy!,"Interesting idea, but must not have been tested by an average or above average child. None of our family has been able to work the toy. Tried different type of bubble soap, but still did not work. I was worried about being able to find replacement smoke, but now, just need a replacement birthday gift."
1,Must agree w/other reviewers - Piece of Garbage,"Never did work. No worthwhile bubbles. 6 batteries (AA), for what? The ""smoke"" was caustic. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. Don't let you kid get excited about it - guaranteed to disappoint!"
3,Cool.. but not really worth it,"When you can get the bubbles working it's fascinating. It's not battery powered so you have to push the trigger several times to get the ""motor"" going. Then you have to quickly dunk it in the bubbles and push the trigger more. Generally I don't have a problem getting multiple bubbles at once, but your finger gets tired from the trigger! The bubbles are easier to see when they're filled with the vapor.. you can watch them float easier, and when they pop the vapor drifts upwards. They do fall quickly though, so I stood on my deck and sent the bubbles down to my daughter. The vapor liquid goes quick... I came on here hoping to find refills, but I may end up getting another blower instead. This is a really cool idea.... they just have to work on the design.. so I'd say try another brand."
2,disappointed,very disappointed in the high magnification pictures taken with this unit.it is a hit and miss on the focus... mostly out of focus.... rarely get agood in focus pic with high mag'tion. i always us a solid tripod when taking high mag pictures........ on the other side of the coin it takesgood in focus pictures on the low magnification lens........but of course i purchased the celestron for the high magnification lens.....i would not recommend this unit to anyone.......
4,Good shoe,This is a great shoe that doesn't rub on the back of the heels. The shoe size was a 1/2 size bigger than her foot measurement.
1,"Really cute, but horribly stiff and uncomfortable","These shoes are so pretty but I didn't have them on more than 1 second and before I even took one step in them, they HURT! The leather is soooo stiff if feels like knives cutting into the feet. I took them off so fast it could have made your head spin! What a shame, I just loved the style and the color is a beautiful, true dark chocolate brown. Darn it!"
5,Very Good,"After Reading this book, I felt I understand what programming is and especially the Graphics User Interface is most vividly described. Maybe because I have no programming experience and is eager to know what Java is about that I find this book useful in trying to understand what Java is all about. I sincerely recommed this book to beginners."
1,WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!,"WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!This woman is a moron. She has no business writing any type of instructional textbook. After attempting to learn Java with this book, I have a newfound definition for the word ""frustration"". Do yourself a favor and do not buy anything written or co-authored by this woman. I own the book but will not sell it because I don't want others to become as frustrated as I was while trying to learn Java. If there was a lower rating than 1 star, she would have gotten it here.WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!"
4,"Great Book, but No Answers","This is a great book to help you learn Java Programming. Unfortunately, it is part of a course system, so you cannot get the answers to the questions and exercises unless you are part of that course. This dramatically decreases the usefulness of this book. I wish I knew a way around this limitation."
2,Buy another Author!,"First, let me say this was my first introduction to Java, and I was very disappointed. I have read Joyce Farrell's books before with like disappointment. Many typographical errors, and a teaching method beneficial to none, especially beginners. I'll try java again, with a different author."
1,Degrading Titles,"I have been wanting to try one of Robin Schone's novels for awhile. I finally found ""The Lady's Tutor"" at my local bookstore. This book will be returned tomorrow. I must admit I did not read the story, or I should say ""CANNOT"" read the story. How a main character can be called ""the Bastard Sheik"" instead of his name throughout the book is appalling. Why not call the heroine ""the English whore."" That one term was such a turn off that I could not read this book. Very disappointing."
1,world of hate,"The author writes of: Homicidal maniac male homosexuals and the mother/wife willing to kill all spawns who cross their path, Spanish Fly as a weapon that must be worked off, super charged sex hero Arab/Brit that turns heroine to tough steel able to overcome all in her path after working through arab sex text together."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I thought this book was excellent. It was one of the most engaging erotic romance novels I've read in a long time. Most are sex with a story to string the sex scenes together. Not this one. The characters had a depth that you don't often see in erotic romances and the plot/sub-plot had me on the edge of my seat. It was one of those books that you think about when you're doing other things because you can't wait to pick it up and see what happens next!The reason I didn't give it 5 stars....I had a hard time getting past the references to ""that special place"" a woman has that enables her to take a ""meritorious"" man. It felt too much like a pelvic exam to me when he was showing her ""that special place"". Don't get me wrong, I love to read about sex that is adventurous and is considered a little off the norm but this was a bit much for me.Anyhow, this is an excellent book if you're looking for an erotic romance that is set in 1800's England."
5,Wow,"Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. This is the way to write a spicy romance! Everything about these two, was perfect. I might just read this book again next month :)I am on the hunt now--I have to read ""Awaken, My Love"". If this book is any indication of her talent, Awaken will be just as good."
5,AMAZING STORY! QUEEN OF ROMANTIC EROTICA!,"I can't get over how terrific this story was. Ms. Schone is the Queen of Romantic Erotica. Her stories have characters with substance. Her characters bond emotionally as well as sexually. I have tried to read other so called Romantic Erotica author's such as Virginia Henley, Thea Divine, Susan Johnson and Bertrice Small but their style of writing leave me cold. They write in such a crass manner about such unlikable characters. Thank goodness we now have Robin Schone to read high quality romantic erotica. I highly recommend this book and anything else Ms. Schone puts out! Keep up the great work"
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!,"This is my first Robin Schone book and I must admit I wasen't impressed. I thought the story was very shallow and boring. The passionate love scenes were WOW!! but that is all that was good about this book. I will give Robin Schone a second chance and read ""The Lover"", I am hoping this book will be much better. I highly recommend you skip this book, its not worth the time or effort it takes just to get through it!"
2,waste of time unless you enjoy explicit read,"At first, this book was an interesting read but later it became about explicit sex with graphic description and some pedophile activities. i like my romance novel(s) to have some intimacy but this book just crossed the line; nice story line though but after reading this book, i regretted buying it."
5,A Five Star Read!!!!!!!,"Once again Robin Schone has gone ""Where angels fear to tread"" with ""The Lady's Tutor"". Her incredible brand of erotic romance is a breath of fresh air to the genre. ""The Lady's Tutor"" is an exquisitely beautiful story of sexual awakening and the blending of two souls. This story will touch your soul too. The characters are extremely well developed - including the secondary characters (especially the Countess!) and there is mystery and intrigue. You will not only read this book, you will feel it as well. When I closed the book on the last page, I reopened to the first and began again. That's a first for me. If you haven't yet read her work, do yourself a favor, get to know Robin Schone!!!"
3,Good quick read,"I found this book entertaining but expected a bit more. The author can definitely create images for one'e mind, but outside of the three main characters, the secondary characters were lacking personality and depth. The plot was good and I did finish it within a day or two, but when I was done, I didn't not miss the characters. My personal rating and recommendation for a book always stems from what is left when I finish. This book did not give me pause to jump into something new. The romance aspect was good and steamy, well detailed without being crude which is a compliment to the author. Absolutely an adult read."
5,Awesome! Incredible! Sexy! Touching!,"This is my first experience with Robin Schone. Wow...I was blown away! I often find myself reading romance novels and wishing the romance was a little...hotter. Well, this book did not disappoint!But I would not classify this as erotica. I would classify it as a sexy, passionate romance novel. There was an intriguing plot, but it was not so complex that it took away from the romance. I find too many romance authors try to make their books into romance/mystery novels. I don't read romance novels for the mystery, ok?! I want romance, love, passion, sex, etc. And Ms. Schone delivered.I look forward to reading more of her books."
4,The Lady's Tutor,"I just loved this book. Robin Schone is a great writer. I especially loved how the heroine realized the hero was for her and she forsake all she had to be with him. She gave up everything to be with him, even though he wasn't what her mother wanted for her. It was a very well written book."
3,Promising first part but a bit disappointing taken as a whole.,"This is my first Schone's book and I`ll rate it with 3 stars because even though l enjoyed very much the first part of the book and The sexual tension between the main characters was great all through the lessons, in some way the rest of the book, let me down. The sex scenes got me bored, they were way too long, and repetitive....so l finished the book out of curiosity.Sometimes , l found the female character really annoying, and hypocrite. And l agree the repetition of the bastard issue throughout the book was a little tiring and degrading.Apart from this, l must admit R. Schone is a tallented writer."
4,Read this Book sitting in Front of a Fan!,"This is the first book that I've read from Robin Schone, and I can hardly wait to get my hands on more of her books. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this book. The story of a woman who needed love and affection and sought out what she felt she deserved. Ramiel, was fabulous, who wouldn't want someone like him to protect and love you. It had all the things that I enjoy about a book, love, sex, and an intriging story that is going on around them. A must read for historical romance buffs."
2,The Lady's Tutor,Not as good as i thought it would be... just too draw out.I did like the end. i will try more of her books.
5,"A definite keeper, this one ranks with the best of the best!","I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. The story, the characters, I could not put it down. My prediction is The Lady's Tutor will rank up there with the best of best!"
2,HOMOSEXUALITY and PHEDOPHILIA in romance novel?,"I know a lot of people loved this book. After all, erotic love scenes are the latest hype in romance novels. The hotter, the better, right? In The Lady's Tutor, there is only one erotic scene and that is towards the end of the book. It would have been a really great book if the author didn't include homosexuality and phedophilia in what is suppose to be a romance novel. In the Lady's Tutor, the hero was raped by another man. There is a scene portraying man on man sex. It was just too dark and perverted for me. Somehow, i get the feeling that the characters in this book are not meant to be happy forever. I also read captivated and in Schone's novella, The Lady's Pleasure(the hero is the tutor again!), homosexuality is mentioned again. I have nothing against homosexuality - I have a lot of gay friends, but i read romance novels as a means of escape. I think i best stick to my 3 favorite authors - Small, Johnson and Devine."
4,Great for people starting from scratch,"I have to disagree with the first reviewer, though I can see where they're coming from. This DVD is specifically designed to take you from scratch. This is for the person who's new to working out or has certain exercises they can't do like pullups. It also serves as an alternate workout plan for fitness trainers or people who want to try a total bodyweight workout. If you're at a intermediate or advanced level of fitness, this may not be for you. Then again, there are professional builders and muscleheads who can't do some of the moves in this or the advanced DVD!! I've seen YouTube clips of guys with 230 lbs. of solid muscle, but can only go halfway on their pullups. This video is about training your body to maneuver your own weight, and getting you ready for the advanced DVD. This video could stand alone, but I recommend getting both. That way once you've done the instructional routine, you can shoot for a bigger challenge."
3,Feel Fellini's sound,"""Fellini Rota"" is one of the few CDs available that really offers a fairly thorough listen to Rota's soundtrack work for the famed Italian director. This music is as legendary as the films, themselves: ""La Dolce Vita"", ""8 1/2"", ""La Strada"", to name a few. I thoroughly enjoy listening to Rota's scores and would offer this CD to anyone who loves Fellini's film scoring and/or kitchy retro lounge pieces mixed with emotional jazz...Italian style. However, I believe there is another Rota release available now-or, at least, soon to be. So, in this case, DO hesitate to purchase this, if the other sounds better. For the films that actually have a soundtrack available, I would try them out, too. There's really nothing better than hearing the music in the manner in which it was composed."
2,Ouch,"Not for long term use such as an entire shift. I tried and after a few days, abscesses formed in both ears and white heads in the ear canal. The increased sensitivity of my ears made the environment even more irritable than if I had not attempted to use these mild sound proof barriers.Short term work best."
2,Unexpected problem,"I bought this motion sensor to work with a LED Rope Light. They say not to use it with CFLs and I know other Heath sensors work with halogen, so I thought it should work okay.Well, my unit sensed and detected motion all right, and even turned a test lamp on and off as advertised. Turning the alarm all the way down gets rid of the sound so you don't have to hear the buzz if you don't want.But plugging in the LED Rope light into the two prong outlet, half the lights within the rope stay on all the time, creating a ""dimmed"" light. When motion is detected, all the LEDs turn on brightly for the indicated period and then return to the half-on dim mode. I can't imagine what kind of output circuit on the contol unit would allow that rope light to stay partially on all the time, but since the unit never completely shuts off power toward the light circuit, it creates a potential hazard in my book.That's the only chance this unit gets with me... back it goes."
1,Why Don't I Heed the Reviews?,We were happy with the first Heath Zenith SL-6019-WH-A Wireless Motion Sensor. But it had to work only to 10 Ft. We ordered a second set for a different project. It would work only to 20 Ft. I read this same complaint in some of the reviews before I purchased the first one. Should have heeded the warning.
2,Junk Quality that Only Works When They are Really Close,"The base only sets off the light if the motion sensor is within about 10 or 15 feet. Any further and it does not work. Also, even within a close range, it does not work if there are walls or other obstacles that do not provide a clear path of vision between the two units. I like the idea of this product, but the quality is just not there. Save your money and buy one of the more expensive units."
1,Don't waste your money,You'll be lucky if you get it to work even once. If outside you need a clear aim. I don't think chicken wire between your outlet and where the senor is would work. It's like buying garbage full of someone else's trash. Pointless and good for nothing...
1,Cheap Price Cheap Operation,Dont waste the $39 range is bad and keeps needing reset. I plugged it in and replaced batteries 4 times before I realized it was the unit and not the batteries that were faulty.
1,Consistently Inconsistent,Bought two of these units before reading any reviews. Took one back thinking it was defective and bought two more. Now I have four that do little more than waste hours of my time setting and resetting. I have switched frequencies and everything else conceivable with no results. Save your money and buy a real security device.
1,Totally unreliable,"I bought two of these sensors at Home Depot. They cannot be relied on to sound an alarm, and even when they do, it is barely audible.It is discouraging that a company that was a leader in its field can produce junk like this, and, apparently, be unresponsive to customer feedback. The user reviews for this product go back more than two years. If Heath Zenith is not listening, Amazon should at least take notice and pull this item out of its offerings.More and more, it is caveat emptor. Neither manufacturers nor distributors seem to have the customer's best interests in mind."
4,For my use this sensor works great.,I used this plug and sensor in my kitchen. I installed puck lighting under the cabinets and then use the plug and sensor. lights automatically come on as i enter the kitchen. I didn't give it a full 5 stars cause I technically didn't use the item as intended. I just turned down the volume on the alarm so it doesn't go off. So there are more uses for the product than just security. The sensor and the plug are only feet away from each other. Maybe this is the reason for it working so great for me. Im purchasing another for my garage.
1,alert volume,"Volume is not loud enough. It is only good for one small room with no noise. It was not what I had expected. I had the volume at maximum, but it was not loud enough to be heard in another room."
2,"Groan, groan, groan....","I'm mostly all for the cavity-causing sweet movies with those same plots (boy meets girl, boy and girl fave a problem, boy and girl get together). I've seen dozens of movies like this: She's All That, Loser, 10 Things I Hate About You... but somehow this ranks as a low. The whole movie I knew what the ending was going to be (not surprising) and prayed that it wouldn't be it. This movie wasn't even that cute. But there were good parts, like the foam party scene, and every scene with Jason Biggs (I'm sooooo not a fan, but even though I've seen a lot of his movies, this is his best). I'd recomend this movie if you REALLY love this type or you just want a movie and don't care which."
1,Love Stinks,"This movie was terrible. Basically Freddie Prince and Claire Forlani have a habit of running into each other before they eventually become friends and then, of coarse, more than friends. Nothing in this film was original. Prince and Forlani don't like each other at first, they have strange best friends, and a final sequence in the airport where one of them is leaving. The only redeaming parts of this film are Forlani's beauty and some decent comic relief provided by Jason Biggs, who plays Prince's roommate and only friend. In fact the funniest part of this movie happens during the final credit sequence in which Biggs has a dream with Victoria Secret models that want him to fart. Other than that this movie was just a waste."
3,Guys and Dolls,"This is not a bad flick if you are after something a little teeny, but not so shallow that it makes you hit your head on the bottom of the pool... getting on a bit of a tangent there.Well, the actors in the movie are all quite likeable, especially the main two players, as well as the ever-entertaining Jason Biggs, and a bit of a little appearance from Alyson Hannigan.The playful, honest friendship between Ryan and Jennifer is great to watch, and there are enough funny moments to provide adequate giggles. There is a strategically choreographed, yet totally unplanned (uh-huh) dance-sequence followed by a bit of bubble action, which adds to the fun.The ending takes it all down hill a little, but overall, it is an enjoyable film - great for people like myself, who enjoy the teenager films (although for the most part of the movie they're all in College - still teeny though of course!)"
1,Worst movie ever,"Even worse than Wing Commander, yet another craptastic movie starring Freddy Prince Junior. Why does it suck? Well first it stars FPJ, so you know it's gona suck already. Next it just sucks. That's it. The story is boring. Hell I don't even remember what it's about. I saw this movie years ago, and all I remember was that I hated it.You know a movie sucks when the only thing you remember about it was that you despised it. Avoid at all costs."
4,Pricey!,"You have got to be kidding on these prices, I could get a better price driving blindly to any store."
2,This movie was stinky!,Prinze and Forlani stunk! There was no plot to this stinky movie. Don't watch it if you like stinky movies. If your a teenager you'd probably like it.But if you don't like kissys don't watch it! I should have watched a rated G movie! Jason Biggs was funny! Ok thats all!
4,A must see!,I absolutely love this movie. Who out there hasnt fallen at least once for their friend of the opposite sex? The relationship between Freddie Prince Jr and Claire Forlani's character is something all of us can relate to. The dance scene with Claire and Freddie was actually really good. This movie reminds me of when it first came out and when i first watched it in middle school. I love it.
1,What have you done... Claire Forlani? And Freddie Prinze Jr?,"How can an admirable actress who did a GREAT job in ""Meet Joe Black"" fall down in this weak film?!! The film attracted Claire Forlani's fans... but as for me I got very disappointed!For all who loved Freddie Prinze Jr. in the successful ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", don't fall in this trap!This is a very common teenagers boring story with a predicatable ending..."
3,Full Of Laughs,"If you're looking for a good laugh and maybe a tear or two, you might want to watch ""Boys And Girls"". With a great script and strong cast (Jason Biggs, Claire Forlani and Freddie Prinze Jr.), this movie sheds new light on the so-called 'teen flicks'. It has a great plot and a story-line: Jennifer (Claire Forlani) and Ryan (Freddie Prinze Jr.), bump into eachother in a airplane flight and keep on bumping into eachother throughout high school and college. Through all this, they develop a strong bond of friendship between one another. Having Hunter (Jason Biggs), Ryan's room-mate adding to the number of laughs, this movie is definitely fit for any one out there. You'll just have to see for yourself to see if Jennifer and Ryan manage to become a little more than friends or not..."
3,dsome laughs,"i doesn;'t really like this movie that much but at least itz made me laugh. i liked some of the movie and thought it waz kinda cool. i liekd cklari forlani. she's pretty hott. the movies eems to go on a little bit to long since we all know whatz going to happen in the end. but, it's an ok film....peace!"
1,What a wonderfully terrible film,"This film, at a wopping hour and a half, give or take, seemed like it lasted forever. Gladiator, right around 3 hours, flew by. i guess when a film is painfully bad, it will show. This film has a brilliant director. Who else would think of putting together 2 of the worst actors of the last few years: Freddie Prinze Jr. and the wonderfully obnoxious Jason Biggs. Freddie goes off to college as a dork, the turns into a teen heart throb, ah, how film mirrors reality.... This film turns from bad to worse when they stop everything logical to have a big dance scene, just like what happened everyday in highschool. This film is for those people that think that they like movies, but are really unsure of what is good. A little help everyone, this is not good. it is the same moronic fluff that is in every teen movie. Skip this and watch a real ""teenager"" movie like Rushmore or Election."
2,For all you Alyson fans out there!!,I just wanted to let you know that Aly has a total of two minutes screen time in this movie... And this movie is totally not worth it!!
3,A great movie,"I like this movie, as I like every other teen movies! This is one movie out of thousond...maybe! But it's good. I like the caracters and the story is cute, funny and simple. A story there as well could be try. It's about normal teenagers going/ groying trough some difficult times. As every one else! I meen this movie i great and I would like to say to you: If you're some day are borred, then borrow this movie and see it with a good friend. I would!"
2,Yawn,"Yet another teen romantic-comedy which has everything going for it except some courage. This only cost $15m, so why not take some risks? I'm sure a teen audience could handle a decent remake of ""When Harry Met Sally"" pitched squarely at their demographic. But as much as it tries to be, this film isn't it. The acting's fine, the direction's passable, but the writing is fatally hesitant. It's neither funny enough nor romantic enough to really get your attention, and simply stalls in Act 1. Both Claire Forlani and Freddy Prinze Jr need to move into more adult roles: both are clearly capable of so much more than this."
1,thought it would be better.....,"...A LOT better. This is the worst F.P.J. movie I have seen so far. I thought this would be funny, but instead its just an annoying, boring, and easy to get sick of in the first 30 minutes of viewing. Its only around an hour & 1/2 long, but it seems like it never ends."
5,The sweetest romance that Freddie has done,"From the time this movie stated I knew that I would love it. It is very very funny, sweet, and I could really relate it to my own life. Plus the fact that I love Freddie. This was a wonderful movie."
3,Predictable,"Average and predictable movie... It seems like a lot of it was taken from ""When Harry Met Sally."""
1,Stay Away,"This movie is bad. It tries all too hard to reach the levels of films mentioned in the film (SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB) and the movie that it ripped off, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, that it hurts to watch. Hurts to watch because it's attempts are so painfully obvious and by-the-numbers, and its failure so bad. Sure, Claire Forlani and Freddie Prinze Jr. have charm to spare between the two of them. But without material to support them, the two lead actors simply do not have the stuff to make this turkey fly. Smartly, the producers tapped Jason Biggs to help out, and he (singlehandedly) almost pulls it off. But ultimately, is it worth your time/money? No."
2,Not a very good movie,"Robert Iscove's teenage-version of ""When Harry Met Sally"" really isn't very good. Actually, it's rather bad. There are, however, some laughs in this romantic comedy, but all in all, the movie's trying too hard to be funny and smart (it's neither smart nor funny). Another weakness are the actors...all of them have performed way better than in ""Boys and Girls"". Claire Forlani is too loud, Freddie Prinze Jr. is just boring and Jason Biggs is far away from being funny in that one.It's not disastrous, but not really worth watching unless you are into brainless teen-movies. Better watch ""When Harry Met Sally""!"
2,Not good...,"Well, I had no real expectations, but this movie just didn't do it for me. The first half blew (trying way too hard to be funny... I didn't smile once..).And the actors... Jason Biggs was being his usual self, Freddie Prinze Jr. was really boring (what else is new) and Claire Forlani's acting was dismal(even though I thought her performance in Meet Joe Black was quite good...)I have to say that the second half did have some redeeming qualities, the story did get a bit more interesting. That's why this movie got two stars instead of the one I was going to give it after the watching the first half.I read somewhere that this movie is supposed to be a ""teen"" ""When Harry met Sally""? Well, if this is the case, please stick with the original..."
4,Surprisingly Pretty Good,"I thought this was going to be another normal teen flick, and it mostly was, but it was surprisingly a little better than most. I mean its not deep, but it was interesting. The dancing scene was absolutely awesome!"
4,archives,"What can I say except that it was all about these entertainers that got together and they were all kind of a great cast of people they worked well together had fun together had a mini story to tell and it was done well. And I guess it helped that I kind of liked one the entertainers father when i got It but, now it should go DVD."
5,Great Condition!,"I got this book thinking it would have a little bit of wear and tear on it. Nope, looks like I just got it for new!! It also came in a timely fashion. Very satisfied."
2,"Decent amount of facts, but poorly written","Overall, this is a pretty poorly written book. Most of the important events are glossed over. The book is written in a list style, spending only one sentence on some important events and people, like the Glass-Steagal Act. World War I gets about 2 pages. Also, the organization leaves something to be desired. The author likes to skip around chronologically in favor of grouping by social, political, and economic topics. This works well in the case of the chapter on Progressivism, but fails elsewhere.Written by only one author - most history textbooks have multiple authors - this books has the feel of getting only one viewpoint. Foner isn't even an expert in this time period; he writes about the Civil War and Reconstruction. There are much, much better US history textbooks out there. I would recommend American Pageant for this level (advanced high school, college survey)."
3,Think critically while you read,"Eric Foner is one of the mot avidly Marxist historians writing today. His political beliefs defiantly show in his writing, so it important for readers to know and understand this so they may understand the bias present in his writings. That having been said, it is a well-organized and clearly written book with excellent pictures."

3,Great Lesson Plan,"These are extremely basic lessons. If you are not interested in owning the hard copy you can subscribe to the podcasts of each of the lessons from iPlayMusic from iTunes for free. As for the lessons themselves, these are really good for beginners!"
3,very beginner only,"This book is primarily for very beginners. If you know how to read tabs or have taken private lessons, this probably is not for you.DVD/videos are great you can put them on your ipod, and you can choose just the guitar audio, or a combo of vocals and percussion as well. they show great split screens of chord hand, strumming hand, and wide shot. The book does not tell you how to play all the chords, just essential beginner chords that allow you to play the 5-6 songs in the book.Average book, there are better out there, the DVD is main selling point. I believe beginner's should start out in the classical style and branch out to the different styles after a year. The classical style gives a strong base for correct posture and clean tone."
5,My nephew loves this.,"My nephew plays the cello. He is really good -- he's in the youth symphony. I thought a book about playing guitar, which he has recently taken up, had to have really good reviews in order to be worth his time since he already knows so much about music. This one had really good reviews, included the cd, and apparently has been just what he wanted -- he even wrote me a thank you note, which I have NEVER received from him before."
4,"cinema nirvana, buddhist movie pearls for all ages",you don t have to be a buddhist to appreciate this common sense approachto the movies we know and love...easy to understand but profound at thesame time......nancy
5,Captivating,Thoroughly enjoyable capture of the nuggets of dharma illustrated in film. This was a grand gift of a book.
1,Thin and Flimsy,"This is definitely not a ""Deluxe"" Shield, it is paper-thin and flexes easily. It can be rolled up into a tube shape, that is how thin it is. I am very dissappointed with my purchase and will be returning it promptly."
2,Easy Reader,"I picked this up from the new fiction books section in one of my University's libraries. I agree with the other reviewers that the book does have an interesting plot and the characters are somewhat realistic. The big however is that this book is written on what appears to be a junior high level. It reminds me of the easy reader book series that I had to read when I was quite small. I have by no means a strong vocabulary, but I struggled very hard to find a single word in the book I did not know. I understand that the author is a computer professional and not an english major, but this was a far cry from an adult level book. It would be better suited for a ""young adult"" section of a public library."
2,Nothing compared to...,"This is poor imitation of Neal Stephenson and Melissa Scott. I kept reading plot developments and characteristics straight out of Snow Crash and Trouble and Her Friends. That said, I did finish the book, so it did keep me interested that long. Basic plotting and shallow characters didn't make it that memorable, however. Read the real stuff instead."
4,Good Tech Novel...Keeps you interested,I'm a techie...this is an enjoyable novel for a techie...check it out...
2,copy,"This is the exact same dvd and songs as on the""cronica"" dvd, I just want others to know before they buy it."
1,contains lead!,My sister-in-law was in our local ToysRus checking out these MP3 players - there is a note on the packaging that the items contain lead and children should wash their hands after using them!
1,"This is a piece of crap, Do not buy!!","I had a hard time getting this set up with music, when I finally got 1 song on it, the battery dies, I have put in 6 batteries so far and EVERYTIME time it says BYE-BYE as soon as I turn it on, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!"
1,Horrible Problems,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. The buttons fell in. they sent a replacement and I had the same problem. Very cheaply made. When I purchased it at Christmas it was half the cost of what it is now.
1,very hard,it is very hard to put music on it and it is very hard to installation the software to put music and i sold it for 12dollers and got my son a ipodshuffle.
3,Read Description,"I got this book yesterday in the mail, and to my surprise, it was not a usable dictionary. Upon rereading the more in depth description, I realized that it was a photocopy (and a rather poor job of one) from a 1920s medical dictionary. Make sure to read beyond the 'comprehensive medical dictionary' and 'copyright 2010' labels."
5,Good Price-Great Author,"Title says it all. Jeni Tenison is an outstanding XSLT developer, her book are top notch. If you develop XSLT pages consider the book..."
2,Stick to your roots,"Mick Moloney told me a few years ago that if it were up to him, all the Johnstons recordings would be buried forever, like nuclear waste. I don't know if he was thinking of any in particular, and if he was including the traditional albums (likeThe Johnstons and The Barleycorn) then I totally disagree; but when it comes to the modern songs, I sympathise.It's not that the performances here are incompetent, but (with one exception) they just don't come off, as far as I'm concerned: they're not folk music, they're not folk-rock, the lyrics sound contrived, they just exist in some sort of limbo.The exception is Ian Campbell's ""The Old Man's Song"", which gets a driving interpretation punctuated by the slip jig ""The Kid on the Mountain"" in the middle. An extra star for that."
5,Colours of the Dawn CD at last!,"My LP from the narcotic sixties is now virtually unlistenable, so it is great to listen to click and scratch free songs that I've loved for many years. Apart from a few 'Greatest Hits' CD's, BS&T albums are unobtainable in South Africa. I paticularly love 'Old Man's Song' with its reference to the Anglo Boer War, 'Clours of the Dawn' and 'Hello Friend'."
5,Light-hearted collection of short pieces,"This is a delightful collection of short piano pieces ""Portraits"" and ""Parson Weems and the Cherry Tree."" The latter is a light-hearted, tuneful accompaniment to the Parson's fanciful tale. The Portraits are fun to listen to. Since there is little in the booklet about these acquaintances of Thomson, I like to imagine who they are and whether I would like to meet themfrom the ""Frenchman-?"" Pierre Mabille and Rodney Lister down to Marcel Roche who seems to have difficulty making a decision without walking around and around the room. Enjoy it!"
2,not impressed,"i was advised to get one of these because they are indestructable, but my dog destroyed it in less than an hour. Not worth the money."
4,Great history of cars,A good look at how the automobile industry grew from a few independent car makers to what it is today. It has many great pictures.
5,Loved it,"I love this book. The only thing I didn't like was the romance was too soon, other than that I loved it."
4,Good reference manual,"This is a good reference manual for all the basic functions of Flash 8. It demonstrates clearly what all the menu options, tools, etc., do; where they're located; and how to work them. As others have noted, it's aimed at beginners. The first couple chapters will be old news for experienced users, and it covers only the most basic concepts for Action Script. It's a good overall introduction, although the text suffers from poor editing and occasional typos. These generally don't affect the content, but they are distracting.If you're looking for a hands-on approach to learning Flash, this isn't it. You can download demonstration files at Perspection's web site, but they're always the finished product, so you don't get much chance to work out the process yourself. The book has a couple of projects in the back, but they're brief and more like extra features than tutorials. If you want something with a ""learn by doing"" focus, consider one of Philip Kerman's Flash books."
3,Just OK,"I skimmed the first 5 chapters and found nothing new there. I got to the sixth chapter only to find that the example files are just that, ""See what we did. Next..."" I do not find this a good method for learning. I need to do, not just see what someone else has done."

4,fits and looks good,"keeps my shoes from slipping into or out of the stirrup. also reduces scratches. I personally like the plain steel without the rubber on the sides. But it is better for me, my horse, my shoes, and my saddle. A littel to pricey for what you get."
3,binaural beware,"I too tried this recording on headphones. These were $29 Sonys, ""closed"" on ear type.The binaural effect simply did not work. I have made binaural recordings myselfusing two cheap omni dynamic mikes stuck on opposite sides of a large chunkof foam rubber and it worked perfectly, simply amazing.Thus, the effect may depend on the headphones or your ears. Or ... theMP3 may be improperly encoded.Doug McDonald"
3,If you like recititive...you'll love this,"Maybe it's just because I like a defined melody or a theme that can become stuck in your head, but the style of ""The Turn of the Screw"" wasn't one that fit me. I like a lot of opera, but had a tough time with this one. I was expecting more defined arias and an occasional group number with all six characters singing together, but I didn't get this. From beginning to end...it was mostly recititive. I like to hear this in Italian, but it loses its effect in English. It definately reflects the modern time in which it was composed. While the orchestra is still a normal orchestra, the music was not like Wagner, Mozart, or Verdi. Britten and Piper wrote appropriately for the fifties, but if you are a fan of hard core classical and romantic opera, ""The Turn of the Screw"" is not for you. The voices are beautiful and the music is great. It is too free flowing for me, but others may really enjoy it."
2,cardboard is heavier...,the lid is so lightweight it is of little use...i put a heavy bowl on top of it (upsidedown) to keep heat inside; it's just too lightweight!
5,Who cares about how it was written,"It amazes me that the people of Eatonton are concerned about how the book was written as far as correct literary style. Most of the people that live in Eatonton couldn't even begin to right a book much less be a critic. This book is fictional, as is stated. If the people of Eatonton try to see if they are mentioned in the book then here again there must be more under the so called ""covers"" than is being shown. Poor, poor Eatonton. Finally you have been exposed, ficticiously of course, keep up the good work David, you have them on the run. Also, the grammar wasn't so good in the tales of Brer Rabbit either, but look what happened to them."
4,THE TONGUE OF THE EATONTON PEOPLE,"DAVID ,CONGRATS TO YOU ON RELEASING THE TRUTH AS IT REALLY IS HERE IN EATONTON GEORGIA. YOUR WORDS MIGHT NOT BE CLASSIFIED AS APPROPRIATE ENGLISH, BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT IS SPOKEN HERE IN EATONTON IS DEFINITELY THE SAME AS YOU PORTRAYED IT IN YOUR BOOK. MIND YOU I AM NOT AT ALL PLEASED AT THE CONTINUED RACISM THAT EXIST HERE. NONE THE LESS IT IS ABOUT TIME IT ENDS. THANKS FOR HAVING ENOUGH COURAGE TO SAY THE TRUTH."
1,drivel,"Poorly written, poorly edited. The story might have been OK but the author's poor command of the English language does not allow the narrative to come through. Worse, his poor command of the ""facts"" make this a story not worth telling."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"As a native Georgian with ties to Eatonton, I was thrilled to learn there was another book written about Eatonton. That is, until I read this book. Unfortunately, it is badly written - misuse of words, gratuitous vulgar language, poor plot development, difficult to follow dialogue and characters who are simply not believable. I was surprised to learn this book is supposed to be based upon actual events, because, unlike the author, I am somewhat familar with the truth of these events and people. This is not a true or factually based story, but having said that, even if it were, given the way the story is written, it would not be worth your time."
1,NUWAUBIC NONSENSE,"As I read this book, I was impressed with how Nuwaubic the author's way of looking at things is. By that I mean that he (1) Apparently thinks he has all the answers; (2) Believes he is the only one who is sane; (3) Thinks everyone who disagrees with him is evil and is part of some giant conspiracy to get him. Now, the story he writes, ridiculous as it obviously is, might have been interesting reading had he only bothered to either learn how to write or have someone else write it for him."
1,EXCEPTIONALLY HORRIBLE,"Horrible attempt...at entertainment, at enlightenment, at literature. Exceptional effort...at defaming people, at embarassing himself, at blurring the line between good and evil, truth and lies. I want my money back!"
1,"Strange, seamy","First, very poorly written. No attention paid to what I'd call ""the rules of writing"" or to more commonly known elements such as style, spelling, grammar, proper plot development & dialogue. Second, if an author promotes his book as truth and it isn't truth, its a bad book. Period. Third, if a book is not based on truth but on the author's imagination, it should be much more interesting. Anyway you look at this book, it's pretty bad."
1,AMAZING,"I'm just amazed that this man would think that he could get away with telling and publishing the horrible lies he has written about so many people! I'm just amazed that this man would write such trash and call it a true story! I'm just amazed that ANYBODY who reads this book would call it a ""must read"" or a ""good book""! And finally, I'm just amazed that this man would publish his book [apparently] without editing or proof-reading it! I've taught seventh graders who could have done a better job in the areas of spelling, vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure. AMAZING-LY BAD BOOK!"
1,Poor Attempt,"I read this book with interest pursuant mainly to reviews I'd seen atthis site and others. ( ) While Moreland certainly exhibits tenacityin writing this book, apparently taking years to complete it, I don'tbelieve ""Kudos"" are in order and don't believe it exhibits a ""bold heart"". Just obsession. His is a mighty poor attempt at telling a cohesive & believable story. END"
1,Sad Commentary,"What a sad commentary. Poorly conceived, poorly written & poorly edited. And getting so much attention."
1,Starless,"If ""negative stars"" were available, I'd have chosen that alternative instead of the lowest rating available, which is one star. I have no idea how much if any of this man's book is fact and how much is fiction. Its the worst writing I've ever had the misfortune to read. This fits in the ""science fiction"" genre! But that would be an insult to other science fiction writers. This man is no writer!"
1,A Nasty Little Book,"Having read this nasty little book, I'm skeptical & suspicious about the comments from the reviewer who believes avid readers will love this book. For the avid readers out there: not only is this NOT a great book, the only way you could lose track of time while reading this book is if you drift off to sleep. And the only way the avid reader could possibly become ""totally absorbed and involved in the story"" would be while trying to figure out who was supposed to be doing what to whom when. Anyone who considers this book enthralling and a real high water mark in his/her reading simply must join the ""Cheesy Romance Novels"" Book of the Month Club. The author's ""unpolished writing style"" is not his only problem."
1,UGH!,"Poorly written and revealing only of the author's urge for revenge upon a whole lot of innocent, well-meaning, gullible and trusting people whose only mistake was allowing the author to stay as long as he did."
1,TERRIBLE TOME,"Unbelievably bad book. Not just due to the unforgiveably transparent motive for publication - revenge - but due also to the terrible lack of ability demonstrated by the author. Interesting that this purportedly true story is written using fictional names for the characters. Had I penned this terrible tome, I believe I would have used a pen name to protect my own identity! It is small wonder this book is self-published."
1,Over the Top,"Anybody can pour out a pile of junk and call it a book. But when someone does and puts it ""out there"" for us to read, he'd better be ready for honest critiques. I'm amazed at a recent review of this book which states that it doesn't matter how the book is written. He/she says the book is fiction so who cares about literary style! And finally, the Uncle Remus tales weren't too great on grammer, so what the heck? Is he/she kidding? The people of Eatonton are much more concerned about WHY the book was written than about how the book was written. This book is touted by the author as being a true story, so the author's motives are going to be suspect. But the style, language choices, and poor plot lines are what makes this particular pile stink."
1,Disappointing Disaster,"What a disaster! Bad from the standpoint of writing style & technique. Worse from the standpoint of plot, content. Worst from the standpoint of ... everything else."
1,FICTION AT ITS WORST,"This story obviously was ""hatched"" in a sick mind. The author, who claims this book is a true story, finds fault with everyone with whom he comes in contact but himself! Very poorly crafted, confusing, dual plot lines, unnecessarily vulgar and completely unbelievable. Truly fiction at its worst!"
1,The Ego That Ate Eatonton,"After the two readings it took for me to figure out the probable point of this book, I finally determined this is the author's attempt to finally get to be the ""big man in town"" he has never been in life. He portrays everyone else in Eatonton as either stupid, incompetent or completely morally bankrupt. The only person, other than himself, admired by ""Frank Moss"" apparently was his foul-talking preacher. Everyone desperately needed this hero to save them - from themselves, I guess. What I can't figure out is whether this author really thinks that much of himself or whether he is so ego-starved that he needs this fix. Sad."
1,EVIL?,"I have read this book twice and I still do not understand it. Its so totally bizarre. I noticed one of the other reviewers believes this is a true story and is glad all the ""evil"" in Eatonton is coming out. I guess the reviewer from Madison would know more about evil than I. But one has to wonder why on earth the writer of this book chose to write it. If really true, use real names. If not really true, write about a fictional place & people. Mixing the two is a bad idea. Finally, the book is written by someone who claims to be a story teller and may be good at that, but he is no writer."
2,Disappointing,"I am in my late 20s so I was watching sesame street in the late 70s and early 80s.I expected a nostalgia trip and was satisifed in many respects.You wonder about Borgenicht's audience for the books as the book seems to be directed at adults, yet they have a lot about Elmo, Zoe, and things that happened on the show during the 90s. Those things I have no interest in and I would have rather they spend the extra pages on a more detailed history of Cookie Monster, Count, Ernie, etc.Overall the book seemed to try to be all things to all people and satisifed none completely."
2,not as good as it should be,"i did like the book but it could of been better. for one they only mentioned why a couple of muppets were discontinued. but they didn't mention why herbert birdsfoot if that's how you pronounce his name or others were banished. and i also wondered how buffy st. marie was written into the series. in other words was she a friend of one of the cast, did she live on sesame st. i never really found out how she got on the show. i'd would of also liked to have seen certain dates on when a certain puppet or film segment was made, how certain films were made and maybe the people who made the film including those who stsrred in them could tell how they were done or they could share any special interesting information about the films. i'd would of also like to know what ever happened to northern calloway. maybe mr. borgenicht could write a follow to this book."
5,One book. Hahahahahahahahaha.,"A fantastic overview of the Sesame Street continuum, this heavily-illustrated tome has songs, behind-the-scenes information, a giant picture of Count Von Count laughing maniacally (worth the price of entry along), and lots of neat information with which to dazzle your friends (apparently Oscar the Grouch was originally brown).The only drawback is a confusion of purpose - it's not sure whether it's a guide for kids or grown-ups, and the information is therefore fairly light (there's no episode guide, for example, and Buffy Saint-Marie is never mentioned fully by name). Still, it's a great thing to have around, and you can dip into it every so often for a new fact.Best of all, it'll make you want to watch the show again, if you aren't already - it's one of the finest things on television anywhere, and anything that encourages people to watch it is a Good Thing in my opinion."
4,A Wonderful Book!,"This book is not meant to be a definitve history of Sesame Street, but rather a picture-rich fan appreciation of the series that entertained and educated children for over thirty years. Those of us who grew up on this show can revel in our memories of such characters as Sam the Robot, Mr. Hooper, and other's who are no longer with the show. The book includes many good quotes from the producers and actors involved, biographies of the principal actors, and little factoids throughout.If you are looking for a good, critical read about Sesame Street, this is not it. But the book is entertaining fluff, a good book to leave on the coffee table when your 25 - 35 year old friends come over. You can watch as they laugh and share what is in the book."
5,Can I Please Give 10 Stars?,"From the moment I opened this book my childhood instantly came flooding back at a great speed. This book is brilliant for the honest and true die hard fan of Henson's Sesame Street, especially for those who think Elmo is way over-rated. Captures classics sketchs such as 'Ernie with the Bananna' and also memorable songs such as 'The Alligator Song'. Buy this book now and treasure it always."
3,"It's ok, there's a better book","There doesn't seem to be much to this book, it's kind of like a scrapbook with basic information about characters. Also, it's outdated. Instead, I'd suggestSesame Street: A Celebration of 40 Years of Life on the Street. I bought both, and if you have the other book you can definitely skip this one."
5,Advance Praise For Sesame Street Unpaved:,"""This book not only good to read,it DELICOUS!"" - Cookie Monster""I can't wait to read ths to rubber duckie!""- Ernie""This book is better than anything! Except for pigeons and oatmeal.""- Bert""Elmo thinks that this book is a big must read!""- Elmo""I had to miss my dance class so I could read this, but boy was it worth it!""- Zoe""This book is now mine, and Radar's favorite!""- Big Bird""This book has so many pages, 196 to be exact! And I loved counting them as I read!""- The Count""This book is complete trash...I loved it!""- Oscar""This book is better than rollerskating with Bird!""- Snuffy""Us super heroes love this book, it's hard coer is great for a weapon!""- Super Grover""Yip yip yip yip yiiiiiip yipyipyip yip yiiiiip!""- The Martins""This book is bigger han us and took us a year to read, but we love it!""- The TwiddlebugsSesame Street Unpaved: Scripts, Stories, Secrets, and Songs"
5,TOTALLY HILARIOUS!,"What a flashback! I loved the fact that they showed the Banana in Ernie's ear sketch! And when the immortal Cookie Monster played Ernie's ukulele...THEN ATE IT! UMMNUMMNUMMNUMM! Cookie has always been my favorite character. I saw some sketches that I was too young to remember when I saw them! One complaint, however. Why is Fat Blue (the customer at Charlie's who always gets Grover as his waiter) in the ""Whatever Happened to"" section? HE'S STILL AROUND! It's just that he shops at other places...but still can't escape the services of Grover!"
3,A disappointing book for this Sesame Street fan,"I was dismayed to find several major errors in this book--incorrect photo captions, incorrect summary of an Ernie/Bert scene in the Introduction, lack of follow-through in the 'why they left' section, and inadequate discussion of the Anything People. Also, the tone of the author is insulting to the reader at the beginning and end of the book. Still, the photographs are excellent, and it did bring back some good memories. My recommendation is to check this book out of the library, as it is not worth buying, but it is worth reading."
5,COOKIE!!!!!!,"I'm 28 years old and imprinted at a tender and impressionable age on Sesame Street. Devouring this terrific book, I could recall word for word Kermit scenes that apparently lodged deep in my unconscious for the last two decades. Sesame Street may be even better now than it was when I was four! One of the best parts is the section on the puppeteers themselves. (I am now able to handle the revelation that there are people behind the Muppets--yes, it was a shock, but I'll be OK.) And the personality profiles of Kermit, the Count, Bert and Ernie, and of course Cookie Monster (my hero) were absolutely wonderful. Sigh. Now I want a cookie."
1,Less than helpful,"I'm terribly disappointed with Play Violin. The CD recordings are fine but the book itself is badly structured with insufficient explanations and the pieces of music seem to follow no logical scale. I go to lessons so don't rely on the book for instruction, but still it's less than helpful."
2,Presentation not Lesson,"If this book was a simple presentation on playing the violin to a class for example, I would give it 5 stars. However, the author pretends to teach beginners how to play the violin. There is no illustration or mention of the placement of fingers on the fingerboard. The book jumps from playing flat notes (G, D, A, E) to more complex notes (C, F#) without any linking illustration/explanation.The only reason I do not hate it: The CD. It contains music samples which can be useful if you have a musical ear or simply want to compare your playing against a more developed skill."
2,Great premise but disappointing,"THE BARGAIN starts out great, it's funny, sexy and has an intriguing premise. Because he has a serious scientific mind, the hero's services have been requested to find the culprits behind a very annoying ghost. Ariel is also determined to unmask the ghost because it has been rumored it may be her recently deceased Mom's spirit and she wants to find out the truth behind her Mom's death. It's not long before these two bump into each other, get locked in a cupboard together, experience all kinds of new tingly feelings and decide that two heads are better than one and join together to complete their investigation. Even though THE BARGAIN did have it's humorous moments, and the heroine was very likable, the plot moved too slow and it was not an emotional read for me."
2,Its fine,Well I Probably wont buy this product again. It could have been better.Some of the items were sort of cheap. If you are looking for a survival kit I recommend youbuy one from[...] There quality is better and the cost is cheaper.
2,Its a gimmick,"This would be good for your 10 year old on his first boyscout camping trip but thats about it. Its more of a gimmick than anything. Yes having this stuff is better than having nothing but your better off prepairing a little better before you need this tin. What do they say, an ounce of prevention is worth..... whatever, you get the idea."
2,"Nifty, but expensive","A neato novelty item. Bought two-one for my son to keep in his truck and one for my 4x4. If it does come in handy, I will eat my words."
4,CATCH A Fish WITHOUT A HOOK!!!,"Not a bad kit for the money. You can buy several and tuck them away in different places. These are compact and store easily. Fishing gear in an emergency kit always makes me laugh. Your first priority is protection from hypothermia/exposure either by clothing, shelter or fire. Second is rescue, being found, extraction, etc. I don't think you'll do much fishing while trying to keep warm at night, and while extracting yourself or being found the next day, as is what happens in most all emergency survival situations. Fishing gear belongs in an extended stay/extreme kit or on a planned fishing trip. I know we all think about crash landing in a remote part of the world near a great fishing lake and the fish are biting... not likely. I'll take a compass over a fish hook any day! Make a fish trap instead - fish swim in and they can't swim out. While the trap does its work you can prepare firewood or signal for help. Good luck!"
5,well recieved,small pack like the fishing line this needs to be in every 72 hour go pack or in your back pocket never know when your going to need it
3,worth purchasing but not a show stopper,"Interesting treatment of a less noted (at least to me) Spanish architect. Some rather unique designs and construction. I would likely be more impressed if I weren't so star struck by Gaudi's work (and there are similarities). Nonetheless, I appreciate Taschen's efforts to draw attention to a wider variety of architects that might otherwise go unnoticed."
5,Wonderful Book !!,"I loved ever page of this book right from the begining, hopefully the author will write more about Bernadette Saint Clare.Great story line."
2,How she made it thru Quantico...,"I'll never know. There are some aspects of this book I really like. And I hope that the author fleshes out her protagonists with the next in this series. I like Agent Bernadette and I really like most of the story behind her gift. But she doesn't seem to have a single, solitary investigative skill. She's an FBI Agent who doesn't seem to know or care about police procedure. Search warrant? We don't need no stinkin' search warrant! I found myself aggravated with her on more than one occasion. There's a glaring lack background and technical information and though the concept is fairly original, the subjects lack... ummph. I didn't feel them or feel for them. The only character I found truly interesting was Auggie, and I knew his angle before she did..."
2,Maybe getting there?,"The writing is very uneven. Vast stretches are just plain dumb, yet there are moments that are fresh and sometimes genuinely funny. Christian religion is central throughout the story, so you might skip this one if that's bothersome for you. On balance, I liked this one enough to be willing to look at more from this author."
2,Turn a blind eye to this book,"This extremely derivative book has only one new twist that I could see, and that isn't enough to justify the price of the book. The protagonist is neither emotionally nor physically attractive, and how the author expects us to believe that she is a trained FBI agent strains the imagination. There is one intriguing character - a ghost - and I'd prefer to read a book about him! Ostensibly a mystery, this novel has no secrets, and the reader knows a lot more than the psychic all through the story. However, I understand that this is the author's first book. I'd be willing to try her next - but only by borrowing it from a library."
2,Told To Get a New One!,"I've used the product about once or twice a week for about 2 years with no complaints. However, I turned it on today, and it will no longer weigh anything. It calibrates and shows the zeroes, but it stays at zero no matter what I put on it. I changed the battery with the same result. I called customer service (called 2 numbers and spoke to 3 different people to get there) and was told to get a new one. Like Paul V, end of story!"
2,Expensive Battery Use,"While the design of this scale is quite good and it is easy to use, you will need to replace the 9v battery every 2 months. We used our machine 1-2x each business day for 20 seconds each time and made certain to turn it off immediately after each use. Still used a 9v every 2 months. Even if your 9v is rechargeable you will wear it out very quickly as rechargeables are only good for a certain number of charges. In addition, battery installation is very tight and awkward. Don't waste your money on this machine. Instead get one with a plug; better yet one that does both (plug and/or battery)."
5,Perfect!,I have been using this item for a couple of weeks now and it works perfectly! Very easy to use and almost no setup required. Measures weight very accurately.
1,Full ingredients should be listed,"I was unable to use this product because it contains gelatin, so I certainly wish the complete ingredient list had been part of the description before I purchased."
5,Escalante: The Best Teacher in America,An excellent book about a very inspirational man. It shows what we can accomplish if we want to. Great reading for any math teacher.
2,The Last Commissar?,"Fisher was a star in Studs Turkel's ""documentary"" on the Lincoln Brigade.He finished out his professional career working for the Soviet Tass Agency.Those of us who experienced life on the dark side of the Iron Curtain know what really happens when the utopia of the Lincolns is put into operation. Perks for high party functionaries like Fisher and grinding, humiliating poverty for the rest.Fisher was not the last commissar. They continue to this day albeit with different job titles.And wherever they commit bloody aggression, whether it be in Spain, Cambodia, Ukraine, Angola, Jenin or Qana, they make it sound like it was done for the good of mankind rather than for its subjugation."
4,Awesome my kids love this!,I bought the kindle version of this book and have it on my Ipad. If I ever need a filler in the youth group I can pull this out and the kids really love it.
1,Poor quality instrument,"I usually use a RWC drum but I bought one of these directly from EMS for a change... and was very disappointed by the poor quality of the instrument ! The synthetic skins became damaged very quickly (after just one session), the leather used was not vegetable tanned and not a good quality neither, the laminate used for the drum was very fragile, I discovered later that the tension ropes (around the drum and sewed to the skins) were stopped with... Scotch tape ! EMS sent me calf skins to replace the synthetic ones I broke but I changed also the leather parts and replaced the scotch tape with a little bit of sewing. Overall the sound is now quite good but the drum remains fragile I think."
1,weather station,can't get it to work and told sender. all he does is email me to do this and that. it just doesn't work and i want to return it. please help3/8/07
3,"Not bad, but outdated","Having picked up the True20 corebook, and finding out that this book was its predecessor, I could not help but purchase it. Like the others said, it is a cleaned-up version of d20 meant more for telling stories than hack and slashing. However, unless you are strictly into fantasy RPGing, you will find this a one-trick-pony. If you already have True20, you don't really need to pick up this book, as it offers very little more.One note about this book; it is rather ""feminine"". I don't really mean that as an insult. It's just that the art has a feel to it that most men won't like. But if you are trying to convert a girlfriend or wife to fantasy roleplaying, then you should definitely use this book instead of d20 or True20."
5,great study tool,"I used this book during my surgery clerkship 3rd year, and to study for my shelf exam. I was very satisfied with the content, and with the questions after each case. I did well on the shelf, and this was my main study tool. I know a lot of my classmates thought that NMS surgery was superior, but I didn't have time to compare."
1,Riddled with errors!!,I have never read a book with so many blatant errors. I wonder if this text was ever edited. Disappointed!!!
2,Too many errors!,"The discussions in the answer sections are correct, but often the wrong letter is indicated as the correct answer! I'm only a third of the way through and this has happened probably 6 times already. Very confusing and a huge waste of time.I have not heard of these problems with friends who used the NMS casebook for surgery. This is the first time I've had this sort of problem with Case Files. Please do a better job editing in the future!"
5,Great mover of air,"I purchased this to move air from a room AC across a refinished attic. Within 15 minutes of turning it on medium, both rooms are cool in 90+ weather. Really moves the air with little noise. A great product."
5,Exceptionally lucid.,"This book is somewhat famous for its heuristic derivation of the full Maxwell's equations using Lorentz invariance, but every topic is covered in an exceptionally lucid manner, on a par with Feynman at his best. The book is also a neccessary antidote for the excessive detail and overgeneralization of Jackson."
4,Review of Principles of Electrodynamics,"Principles of Electrodynamics by Melvin Schwartz is a very well written, very didactic book. The principles of Electrodynamics are clearly shown and the author explanations and demonstrations are rigurous but easy to understand. The book is a very good reference for certain topics of Electrodynamics not so well covered in other text books."
4,It actually works.,"I would have given it a five star rating but for the poor instructions and the fact it took three sprayings before I noticed any change in growth. Despite that it is pretty obvious where I missed spraying because of the tall grass! If they wrote clearer instructions, particularly about dosages, I would give this a five star rating. If you buy this I suggest you consider doubling the mix (or call the company for advise) in order to get a more rapid response. It isn't really a great year to make an evaluation considering I live in a drought area and can't water much. Still, the difference is obvious where you have normal growth rates."
3,Postcolonial Plays,"This is a great book, but was not at all in the condition it was advertised in. There are obvious coffee and water stains on the pages and binding."
3,be careful witht the sizes,"The shoes are beautiful, but be careful, because they fit small. I am 7and a half, and when i received the shoes that size, they didnt fit me. they were too small. so be careful when you buy them."
5,Excellent,"The gnocchi is great. I use to buy it at walmart and they quit selling it. So, I opted for the internet. It arrived fast and is delicious."
4,Cute Books; Funky Fonts,"Geronimo Stilton books are cute. The stories are well written, although sometimes they seem to go off track. However, my son LOVES the series and anything to get him to read is good enough for me :-) The fonts are the only thing that drives me a little crazy but again, my 8 year old actually finds the fonts entertaining. Go figure!"
1,The resolution of this book on kindle is pretty bad.,"I don't like the resolution of this book on kindle. You cannot enlarge the letters because each page is an image of the book's page. So when you enlarge it, the resolution is terrible.My kid complains the letters are too small and because is an image, there is no way to enlarge the page without getting a crap resolution.I definetelly don't recommend to buy this book for kindle app."
4,L'Eclisse,"I barely remember this song 'cause I was so little,maybe 10-year-old, butthis song sounded beautiful and stil remind in my mind, can't forget."
5,Great overview of coaching,"Highly recommend this book. The author clearly explains coaching and how its correct use can impact both your organization and your success as a manager. He gives plenty of facts and outlines for use. A must buy!Also suggest a well-received book that espouses coaching and leadership skills and responsibility in a unique and easily read way. My company uses it for leader development/training. It's called """"The Leader's Guide: 15 Essential Skills."""""
4,Good all round resource,"I found this book very good as it gives a good general background to coaching as well as an introduction to coaching in the corporate environment. There were some parts that I did not agree with as I felt they contradicted the basic coaching principle of always working in clients agenda, but, that said, it is a good overall resource."
4,great original book on coaching - still work a read!,"This book was outstanding when it first came out - and it has truly stood the test of time. Sir John provides a welcome breath of reach air from the often all too frequent US-based and over-hyped coaching genre. Along with Thomas Lenard, Sir John Whitmore is one of the real pioneers of life coaching and workplace coaching. A great book."
2,Difficult leap from tennis to business,"I used this book for a class on coaching and developing employees. There were eleven people in the class that read the book and each was very disappointed. The overall conclusion was that the author should stick to sports, as the attempt to link the priciples to business was too far of a stretch. We will not be using this book again."
5,Fascinating old book!,People in the library world might enjoy reading this great old book on how to be an effective librarian.
5,Totally dig these,"These fit well and look great. They appear to be super durable, yet are not excessively heavy or bulky. They are cool looking enough so that I don't feel like some goober-soldier-wannabe, yet are the real deal when it comes to tactical purposes (in terms of CCW, extra magazine storage, and adaptability) and mil-spec indestructability."
5,Props for Propper,"I really liked the construction and design of these pants. The button fly was no problem, I've had them before. The instantly became my favorite pair of pants. I can't wait to try them in the woods or fishing."
4,Propper BDU Pants,"I bought these to go with the Propper shirt. The only reservation I have is that they try to cover a four inch waist variation in each size. If you are on the low end of the scale like me, you have a lot of excess waist. I made pleats in mine and now they fit fine."
2,"Good read, but very common sense.","This book was informative and full of fun anecdotes, but I didn't find it very useful. Most of the information contained was rather common-sense for a savvy traveler, or someone who spends a lot of time in cities.Think smart, protect your belongings, don't go out in dangerous areas at night, and always feel secure with your surroundings."
4,Great Product,"I bought one of these laterns for a 9 day camping trip. It is very easy to use and turns on with a flip of the switch. It is so much nicer than having to worry about finding matches in the dark. It is also great because it fits on the top of a proprone can and you don't have to bother with puting fuel in it. The ingition switch has an automatic flow so there is no need to pump air into it, and the mantles will last longer.The stand is very stable, we used it on a pontoon boat and it sat on the deck with out tiping over even while we were moving. The only down fall that I saw was the brightness of the latern, it was not very bright. About a 3-4 foot radius. A frind of mine had a North Star Latern which actually gives off more light. But over all it is worth the money. I am thinking about buying another one for my next camping trip."
5,Beautiful Anatomy,"This video prosection of the head and neck is a beautifully prepared, expertly produced aid to the study of anatomy. Having done a dissection course in anatomy, I could not and did not perform as expert a dissection as this video series does. You see cross sectional anatomy that is seldom presented in a formal anatomy lab. Your three dimensional understanding of anatomy will take shape as you watch! Bob Acland, in his soothing British accent, narrates the video and makes you feel as if you're sitting in your living room, in front of the fireplace, sipping a cup of Darjeeling tea! Dr. Acland made it a priority in his life to produce an educational tool for students of anatomy that was affordable on a student's budget. The entire series can be had for far less than most single textbooks!The series is a pleasure to watch, and there is plenty to refresh the memory of one who has used anatomy daily for over 30 years, as I have. Congratulations, Bob, on a job well done."
2,Not a good primary reference,"I was looking for a primary reference for the Excel object model. I have years of programming experience, some VB, and was looking for something to get me started programming Excel VBA. This book is not suitable as a primary reference. Much better are either Power Programming (Walkenbach) or Excel VBA (Bovey) which contain many useful tips and gotchas that helped me out of a few baffling situations. Roman's book seemed to focus on the few examples he developed, rather than be a resource for problems a beginning/intermediate Excel programmer was likely to encounter."
2,Not helpful for an intermediate programmer,"When purchasing this book, I already had in mind the macros that I wanted to program and the logic I was going to use in order to accomplish the task. All I was really looking for was a breakdown of the syntax in VBA (I'm new to the language), and a list of commands that were available. Trying to extract this information from the book was tedious at best. It would have also been useful if there was an example or two of how some of the basic syntax works. I can only really use it as a second reference from the help menus already provided in excell and the online microsoft tutorial... suggest checking out that link and thumbing through the book at a store before buying it."
2,The Title of the Book has Been Mistaken,"When I bought the book, I was impressed by its title and TOC since they give the promise of leading the reader into macro programming. However, it is rather a large-volume Excel/VBA reference, not a book on how to write macros.Unfortunately, there is no system of introducing the reader gradually into the language (as in all usual programming textbooks) by introducing concepts, giving examples and requesting particular exercises.On a positive note, the book contains (all) VBA concepts relevant to Excel macros and can very well serve as a future reference once the reader has bought another book to learn how to code within some range of macro programming."
2,Dull and of no practical help,"This book is the equivalent of the eastern-European piano teacher I used to have when I was a kid: proper learning involves strict discipline and sufferance. If you don't read this mind-numbing book from cover to cover, you won't get anything out of it.I usually love Oreilly books, but this one has simply been useless for me. Time and time again I open it up for help, and I never find any answer.Actually, last time I looked up a particular topic, it essentially said ""You can do it this way, but there are better ways of doing it"", and gave no further information. That's what I call useless information."
4,Not the best,"This book is kind of old and I believe there should be a lot better tutorials in this area. However, it is cheap and affordable. The paper quality and layout are poor and papers may get detach from the book cover easily."
1,Epistle of James,"Unfortunately, the item has not yet arrived.I have no concern that it will be satisfactory when it arrives.I hope it will nto be too long coming."
1,Passing off?,"This product, titled ""Rummy Game"", is advertised and sold on the same page as the ""RummyKub"" games sold by the Pressman company, and appears to be the same game. It is, and it is not: It has the same pieces,though of lower quality, with the blue color pieces and the black color pieces virtually undistinguishable in low light, BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE the popular and desired RummyKub rules, because those rules are copyrighted by the Pressman company. Instead the Rummy Game include a set of impractical if not unplayable rules. Don't buy it."
1,Junk,"The picture for this product is not what they ship to you at all! The racks are pressed particle board, not wooden (this picture depicts the beautiful wood grain). It is not leather, and it is not brown on brown, they sent black and red. This is NOT the Rummykub set you are looking for--turn back now! :) And further more, this is not a TOY, as it clearly states on the box. . ."
5,Very Nice!,My father and brother each have a set like this and we play frequently when we are together. The tiles are luxurious to the touch and the colors easy to discern. The tile holders are well designed and the case is very nice. The product is exactly what I had in mind when I made the purchase.
3,rummy cube,rummy cube - the wooden racks fall apart quickly - back stand come out - bottom strip separates - game is fun
4,Will There Be A Club Classics 2?,"I'm a mix CD junkie, and this CD was a good fix. I hope there will be another in the series mixed by the same DJ."
1,This stinks,"What is everyone raving about ? This cd is whack..Dj who ? Strobe light ? Old titles, the mixing is alright but nothin special. People writing phony reviews=I m selling mine on ebay after I burn it if any wants it/ tomallen@aol.com"
1,Nope.,"You have to be something I'm not to get this book. Light on useful data, heavy on personality. Overall not very useful or helpful (or entertaining, for that matter)."
2,Too dang wordy,"Rob Fisher (no relation) is right: this book is a disappointment. Wildi's pictures are beautiful, but a good editor would have trimmed the excess verbiage, most of which covers basic compositional guidelines. Much of the information in this book is covered more concisely in Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure"" and Jim Miotki's ""BetterPhoto Guide to Digital Photography."""
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"This is just Wildi's usual pointlessness with the word ""digital"" added to the title. Photo composition has not changed with the end of film, but Wildi's book was not about composition back then either. He simply repeats (over and over in fact) all the same tired advice you can find in any Kodak snapshot booklet.There is at least one good book on photo composition available today.""The Photographer's Eye: Composition and Design for Better Digital Photos by Michael Freeman."" a book that really is about composition and should be in the library of anyone serious about photography. Furthermore, The Freeeman book is no more expensive than this collection of cliches."
2,Could've been better,"the overall figure is pretty good in detailing, however i purchased it twice and in both cases sting lit up green not blue"
3,A bit of family history,"Having just been shown a copy owned by my aged (82) aunt, I am amazed at the price this book seems to be commanding - anywhere from $190 to $340 at various out-of-print booksellers. The book does show an interesting portrait of the wealthy, landed horsey set of the early 1900s. Ms. Combs seems rather self-absorbed, to be sure, and her condescension to those less fortunate is in itself rather fun.I also note that my now-deceased uncle, Horace Neal, was one of Ms. Combs' hired labourers, and is present in several vignettes. It is interesting that Ms. Combs protrays his grammer as representative of the worst of the American backwoods, while in fact Horace was quite well-spoken. Perhaps she could not imagine that one of limited education and lowly station would speak well. Such attitudes are no doubt as old as class distinction.I recommend the book, but also suggest that the reader borrow instead of purchasing one."
5,Amazing!,"This book teaches you how to resolve conflict, and explains why that is the key to making a relationship work. Most books tell you to resolve conflict, but don't tell you how. This one does. With these skills, in theory, you could have a successful relationship with almost anyone on the planet. Of course, there is that other thing that you actually have to like the person you are with! :-D It is one of the best books I have ever read."
4,What Drugs Can Do For You,"Susan Blakely and Powers Boothe both do a superb job of portraying a drug addict and an alcoholic. As both of their lives are hitting rock bottom, these two misfits meet and fall in love. When their addictions threaten to cost them their new found and much needed love, they are forced to take a hard look at themselves."
5,A Must for all Grieving Children,I have given this book to a number of grieving teenagers who have found this book very helpful. I have also had requests for this book from others who have seen it. I usually order it by the dozen.Children are often the forgotten grievers. This book gives them a place to express what they are feeling as well as it may answer some of their questions. It lets them progress through the grieving process without using a whole lot of words. Journaling is very helpful in grief work.
5,Sony BM-575 Microcassette Recorder,"Excellent product. Very durable with a metal case. We use it for extensive dictation in the field. It is very easy to use with its slide switch and holds up well to extended use.The only thing that I feel could be improved is the tape speed selector switch. It is easy to change tape speeds and you can sometimes do it without being aware. As a fix, we have placed a small piece of transparent tape over the switch to hold it in place."
1,Disappointing Product but Great Customer Service from Amazon,"The rewind button, which separates this dictation device different from the typical $50 tape recorder (those that do extensive dictating know what I mean) broke after about 1 hour of use. This is the only portable micro-cassette recorder on the market I could find with a one thumb control (record, rewind, play) that allows to go from rewind to play by just releasing the control via a spring action -- necessary for efficient dictation. I had used the earlier version (Sony bought out Lanier) for 10 years without a problem. I returned the product for a very efficient refund. I think this is the first defective item I have purchased on Amazon (no fault of Amazon or the Company that shipped the device), and I was pleased with how the refund process worked."
3,Foi um pedido,A pessoa que pediu ainda usa esse tipo de coisa e disse que essa é uma boa opcao para aqueles q resistem a era digital. :)
4,Christianity and Magick,"An excellent book upon the magick of alchemy and the interelations with Christianity. Great for Christian studies and the realtionships to magick and alchemy, especially when compared to the usual bull crap that seems to be written about these realations by many ""fundamentalist"" contemporary writers."
3,mase is better than usher,mase and usher were having competion with each other by brandy but mase never went out with brandy
1,FFFGHJ,usher is better then mase I hate mase and I wish Brandy would go to h#*l and she's a B#@ch I LOVE USHER THAT'S MY DOG..........................................
1,...,Theybare too small it says they are made in Taiwan but they shoulw be made for people with normal zise penises hhaha
4,Warriors of God,"Follow the spiritual lives of about twenty atheletes in this book. You'll read about Mark Brunell, Reggie White, Curtis Martin, Junior Seau, and many many more athletes in this book. To these guys, following Jesus is a big responibility in like and they will tell you how they came to find Him."
1,jasmine doesn't smell like that...,"I was really disappointed in the smell of these, I understand that they're cheap, so you get what you pay for, but these smelled NOTHING like jasmine. It's one of my favorite scents and to me these smelled like something you'd wipe an infant with. I had to immediately throw it out because it was such an unpleasant aroma."
5,"Great filter, great value!","I ordered this as a replacement for my above-ground hot tub. I needed a filter that was compatible with the Unicel C-4950 and the filter I received fit perfectly. The filter is working just fine, and I would definitely order the same replacement filter from this vendor again."
5,"Great filter, great price","Works perfectly for our Evolution Spas model CSXi80! Came presealed in plastic wrap, fits without issue and much cheaper than the local spa store!"
2,Warning: you may have already read this!,"I love Ms Krahn's books. I've been reading her work over a period of about seven years. That being said,I'm disappointed and, I feel, with just cause. This is the second time I have purchased what I thought was a Betina Krahn ""new"" book just to find that I have read it years ago under another title. I think this a deceptive practice. If an author is going to have a book reprinted there should be a disclaimer somewhere in the advertising stating a title change. So, buyer beware."
3,All right,The beginning started off so good and then it went down from there. Too much bickering for me and it picked up at the end. It was all right but I did a little skipping around.
3,Small but interesting,"Did Steve Martin's novella by the same name come first? I think so. Now, it's this movie which is a little rumination on the choices we make. I think it's Martin's own story. He seems a little lonely."
1,Cure for Insomnia,"If you liked 'Lost in Translation' or 'Return to Bountiful' you'll like 'Shop Girl'. Steve Martin AND Bill Murray should stick to their bread and butter, comedy, because they stink at anything else. I can't even begin to tell you how unimaginative and amateurish this movie is (especially his little narration). I don't have an axe to grind against Steve Martin, I just don't want you to waste an evening like me and my wife did watching it."
3,So-so,"With a pace and tone reminiscent of ""Lost in Translation,"" Steven Martin's quirky story of a lonely LA girl is surprisingly well done."
3,The flaw is Steve Martin,"A very enjoyable movie, hindered from excellence by the drab, unconvincing performance of Steve Martin. His character is supposed to be ""independently wealthy, intelligent and charming, and after asking her out on a date he sweeps her off her feet."" Instead, he finds conversation difficult, his facial expression rarely changes, he hardly moves physically, and he seems hesitant and uncertain about approaching her sexually. He portrays the exact opposite of someone intelligent and charming who sweeps girls off their feet and misleads them as to his actual intentions. Because his performance is so monotone and uninteresting and because he exudes no charm or sexuality whatever, one of the three balls (girl, boy, older man) is dropped and neither superb performance by the other two can make up for it. The movie lacks credibility, interest and heart all because of the guy who wrote the book! I was surprised."
3,If you read the book...,"I read the book about five or six months before I saw the movie and it tears me apart to say that I was extremely disappointed in it. Claire Danes is exactly what I expected Mirabelle to be. She played the character just as I had pictured it in the book. Jeremy was the character that, I thought, had most depth. Unlike in the book, the movie follows him around on his journey around the country and shows how he forces himself to change rather than miracuously becoming a new person like it seems in the novella. Steve Martin was absolutely terrible. Not only was he an awkward narrator, but a completely one-dimensional character. This is even more aggravating because he created the character of Ray Porter. If anyone should have known how to put emotion into it, it should have been him.Over all, if you are interested in seeing this movie, give it a try. It wasn't terrible, but it was by no means entertaining."
2,They said it was good like Lost in Translation,"I read a lot about this movie, and anticipated seeing it for quite a while.I must say I was quite underwhelmed.Every character made me want to punch something.I usually enjoy these kinds of love stories, but this one had no redeeming qualities. Even the soundtrack was annoying and simplistic."
1,Wish that she could have found one guy worth loving,"Sorely disappointed by the emphasis on physical sexuality that left little room for character development. I found it difficult to sympathize, or even identify, with any of the characters as they remained self-absorbed. The only part worth watching is the end, where Ray ends up where he began and where he should have stayed: ALONE. And Jeremy and Mirabelle finally mature as characters as something that resembles a relationship begins to develop."
3,Book is MUCH BETTER so i hear,"It has been a good while since we saw Clare Danes in film. I think the last might have been the very forgetable Brokedown Palace. I loved the charcter of Mirrabelle in this movie she gave her such depth through her emotional up and downs although there is no concentration on her ailment which is depression. What can i say about Steve Martin, he can do it all act, comedy, paint, and write, and has been on Saturday Live the most of any comedian. If you have a rainy weekend it is worth the time and money to rent this flick."
5,Different side of Steve Martin,"I have never thought of Steve Martin as anything other than annoying. It wasn't until I saw him in ""It's Complicated"" when I started to appreciate him. Shopgirl came out long ago but rapidly become one of my favorite movies. Jason Schwartzmans slow humour, Claire Daines charm, and Steve Martins smooth appeal makes for an interesting watch."
4,Bittersweet love story,"Mirabelle is a young woman from Vermont who has moved to Los Angeles so that ""her life can start"". She sells accessories at Saks and her life consists of going to work and then going home to her cat. Suddenly she has two men in her life--Jeremy who is a kooky starving artist, and Ray, a wealthy older man who sweeps Mirabelle off her feet. It looks as if this is going to be an easy choice for Mirabelle, but things happen which change the way she looks at each of these men. Steve Martin wrote the book and plays Ray and he truly shows his sentimental side in this charming movie."
2,What happened Steve Martin?,"I was a fan of Steve Martin films. They always had a good story (""The Jerk""), were quite funny (""Tres Amigos"") and wholesome (""The Man with Two Brains""). This film had potential because it had a good story but it is not funny nor wholesome. What's all the preoccupation with sex, Mr. Martin?"
3,Mediocre,"Given the premise of this film, I normally wouldn't have watched it. However, since it was recommended by a friend and since Steve Martin was involved, I figured I'd give it a shot. I found it to be pretty mediocre. Of the three main characters, only one of them, the Jeremy character, was very interesting to me and he had hardly any screen time. The story itself was kind of uninteresting and the storytelling was pretty lackluster. Martin's performance was mediocre at best and the relationship between him and Danes just didn't seem believable (much like Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment). None of the characters were developed all that well. So, it seemed like a conglomeration of semi-interesting ideas, none of which ever came to fruition."
3,Wrong-headed narration decision,"What were they smoking? To have Martin narrate the film and refer to the character he plays (Ray Porter) in the 3rd person is jarring and dumb. Everyone can hear that the narrator's voice and Ray's both belong to Steve Martin. Huh?Otherwise, this is a gentle flick that doesn't know what it wants to be. Danes is magnetic as the Vermont girl in the big city, but her visual mannishness sometimes is derailing. I guess Martin's narration is supposed to be the voice of God, with all the Clarence Oddbody stars in the sky and such. Ray Porter (a ""logician""?) is shown, ultimately, as an empty man nearing the end of an empty life. Why he uses the word ""love"" in his last encounter with Danes/Mirrabelle is either puzzling or sad. You decide.But after viewing the mental carnage of ""DaVinci Code"" and ""MI:3"" last weekend, I thank God (or Steve Martin) for the arrival of this quiet, intelligent film."
4,Moving and true to the book,"First of all, ignore the reviewer that gave Shopgirl 1 star. Based on his review I'm pretty sure he didn't see the movie and he has also given every other movie out there 1 star.Shopgirl was a very good film, moving in its simplicity and honesty. I am a fan of the book which I read some time ago, but I was just as touched by the story in filmed form. Steve Martin was especially good as Ray Porter, a man who is unwilling to commit to Claire Danes' character, Mirabelle, a lonely young woman who is brought out of her shell by Ray.I'm so happy to see Mr. Martin finally get to display his talent in a true adult story. His skills have been so underutilized in mass appeal films like Cheaper by the Dozen and Father of the Bride. Claire Danes was also very good, she really conveyed the loneliness and desire to be loved that was at the core of the choices she made."
2,The book HAS to be better...,"I love the pieces Steve Martin has written for the stage. Picasso at the Lapin Agile is simply excellent. Though I had not read the book, I had high hopes for the film version on Shopgirl. Love the cast. 30 minutes in and the mood is set: Garden State con Lost in Translation in L.A. 60 minutes later and you wonder why you wasted your time. So; Treat people you hope to love with honesty and compassion? Don't be cruel? Ya think?"
2,Boring Love Story,"Ultimately, who cares about any of these people? Not enough to know about them to do so. Waste of almost 2 hours!"
1,"Emotionless, bland & self indulgent","What a godawful piece of self indulgent, garbage. Clair Danes was ok. But her character has no self respect, personality or any significance to the story other than being the girl in a love triangle. An extremely long, boring movie about a love triangle with people who have no rapport whatsoever, and express no real attraction and have no reason to be together. It was like a modern day version of Jane Austen's Emma, but without that tedious interesting dialogue, and not a single redeemable character. There's occasional and jarringly pretentious narration by Martin himself. And a completely out of place, Three's Company plot twist with a co-worker trying to steal a rich boyfriend."
1,Horrible....Don't Shop!!!!!!,"I should have known better to rent this movie when the book seemed so dull. However, I thought with Steve Martin in it, maybe it would be ok. WRONG.This movie is AWFUL. It is boring, the characters are bland and weird, the story is so blah it is virtually nonexistent. Its just plain creepy that Steve Martin is having sex with this young woman ( and she is ok with it, ewwww). His character is just as noninteresting as everyone else's. Thank God we didn't see him naked.Don't waste you time on this one."
1,Title,"This movie sucked. It's boring and pointless. Some old dude(Steve Martin) starts going out a lonely young woman (Claire Danes) but he doesn't love her because he's a rich old fart who doesn't take relationships serious. I mean he's 60, single and happy with it. (What does that tell you?) Then she finally leaves him and goes with that retarted idiot who atleast always did like her. Then the old dude realizes what he lost. Yeah okay..."
4,W. Seal,"The reviewer W. Seal in the spotlight review soundw like he has a chip on his shoulder.It's totally possible for a 25-yr-old to be temporarily blinded by a suave older man. As becoming a damaged goods, who hasn't been damaged by life's bumps and grinds? To live triumphantly after failures and disappointments is the beauty of human spirit.It's wrong to render a jugdment on Mirabelle, being a ""damaged goods"", will ruin Jeremy's life in the future.The thing is, how life unfolds is not always black and white. Give the characters some sympathy and the benefit of doubt."
3,Shopgirl,Good movie!!! Not great. This is the second time I've watched it. First time awhile ago. The book was better.
3,"Definitely a ""couples"" film...","Since this film was ""linked"" to Steve Martin, I expected chronic ""quirkiness"". But, instead I found this movie to be warm, engaging, timeless, and, of course, thought-provoking. I now find myself anticipating the next Steve Martin-novella-turned-movie."
2,DANES IS DELIGHTFUL BUT...,"Claire Danes is the saving grace of this rather dull May/December romantic film. She owns the screen and even though her character isn't always admirable, Danes instills her with enough depth to make her sympathetic and believable. Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't match her performance. SHOPGIRL seems to be a real vanity project for its writer and actor Steve Martin. Based on his novella, the story is so sanitized and predictable, and never makes a commitment to being either a comedy or a dramedy. Martin is enjoyable when he's funny, but trying to play a straight role he seems mercilessly miscast. Add a whiny, often obnoxious Jason Schwartzman and you get the ingredients for this soupy tale. The whole thing between Jason and Sampras is wasted film as it does nothing to further or enhance the plot. Even if PINK PANTHER is a bomb, I'll probably enjoy it more because that's what Martin does best."
5,A Favorite,"This movie is one of my favorites. I don't remember it getting much advertisement or recognition during the time it was in theaters, but I really think that it should have. It IS a romantic comedy, which I usually don't care for. This one, however has a more realistic quality to it. The humor in it is subtle, but great and the ending is not your typical mushy cheesy ending that many other romantic comedies possess. It is well acted, has interesting characters, good music, and a good story. I can watch it again and again."
2,Pervy,"I love Steve Martin but this movie totally missed the mark. Two men are fighting for one woman. You have a rich, well established suitor who is old enough to be her father and a high school drop out who can't keep a job and looks like he is still in high school, going for the same woman. The story line could have been great but I struggled with how stupid she was!"
2,Emotionally Flat & One Dimensional,"Or should I say downright dull? The acting was superb on all counts, but that is all I can say positively about this movie. It is slow, horribly slow, and the characters have no depth to them. Plus the conversations between them are just as drab & the interactions between them all leave you wanting more of a performance from them.I kept watching this movie in hopes that it was somehow going to get better, but unfortunately it didn't. Don't waste your time or money watching this film."
1,Just Dreadful,"This was one of the most laborious films I've ever made myself sit through. Claire Danes is an excellent actress and does a fine job with her kind of pathetic, ""late bloomer"" type character. (Marabelle, if you're looking for companionship, get a dog and leave the old user guy alone!) Steve Martin is just himself - no special acting required. Jason Schwartzman turns out to be fairly loveable, but it takes the length of the entire movie for the viewer to realize it. C-Span is more exciting than this movie. Friends don't let friends watch Shopgirl."
3,"rich man, poor man","Rock music and computers as modern ways to make loads of money?She didn't ask the rich guy if he had a condom!In this movie a sleep around modern girl gets a lesion inbeing a mistress to a rich man.I thought Claire Danes was better than this,but she has a nude scene ( may be a body double?).The movie is stupid and slow moving.I didn't like it."
3,relationships in a snow globe,I found this movie very moving. At times I thought it was a little slow or underdeveloped. But as you got more into the characters emotional developement or lack thereof it was a common story thats never really been told on film. It also gave the male/female perspective of relationships very nicely. Something that is not so easily done. The cinematography was beautiful and reminded me at times of a Wong Kar Wai film. It is also interesting to note that the film was adapted from a book that Steve Martin wrote.
4,Antagonist as Narrator,"A strangely moving urban triangle tale, ""Shopgirl"" moves beyond the B level by using the unsual conceit of omniscient narration from the POV of the affluent antagonist, who loses the love of his life to a drifter capable of loving her enough to change. As a fable for our time, it's hit and miss because of the shallowness of the pivotal character. But her rescue at the end still has us applauding the movie for its heartfelt intentions which in the end slightly over-balance its pretensions."
2,I wasn't impressed,"With Steve Martin and Claire Danes, I definitely expected more out of this movie. I found myself bored throughout the movie, and if I wasn't doing laundry while I was watching, I don't think I would have watched the entire thing."
1,TERRIBLE,"I rented this from a local video store and found it to be the most boring, pointless ""romantic comedy"" I have ever seen. The box said it was ""disarmingly funny,"" but there's hardly a joke in it. Steve Martin is especially not funny, and I'm sorry Steve, but we're just not interested in seeing your rapidly-aging face unless you're hilarious. Summary of the movie: Claire Danes plays a young girl with a crappy job. She meets a loser, who goes on a road trip with a band, leaving her to meet Steve Martin's character at her crappy job, and they have a pointless quasi-romance. Then the loser guy returns, after becoming successful. And guess what, she chooses him. Oh, did I ruin the ending of the movie for you? Don't worry, because it's absolutely an abortion of a movie."
2,disappointed,"I fell asleep during this film. That's how unengaging the characters were. scarlit johanssen put in a nice performance so did her young co-lead but Steve Martin who I usually love was bland. And none of the characters were well developed. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry. The pseudo profound observations of narrator steve martin made me ill."
2,Pointless,"Ok steve Martin has completely lost it. This is a completely wortless pointless piece of selfindulgent exercise only of interest to people who have been movie stars to long. A waste of time for anybody else. Avoid at all costs. I used to like Steve Martin but he has clearly lost touch with reality. sad, very sad."
3,"Great acting, bizarre music","This is not a happy little love story. Clare Danes and Steve Martin are wonderful, and the script is flawless. But the music is like something out of a modernized Hitchcock movie. There were these montages with this weird music that made me feel like something creepy was about to happen. It ruined the story for me--which could have been quite beautiful had I not been expecting someone to get stabbed in the shower."
2,bondage a-poppin',"Not for me -- no one in this book could get excited without being tied down first. Bondage fans might like it more, though."
3,He has written better,"This book is nothing like his previous. With this book he tries the healthier side. The recipes are good, but like with anything healthy, he sacrificed some taste. It is written with his always step-by-step walk through of the recipe. How it should look, how it should taste, etc. at each step of cooking."
2,"Love Prudhomme, but hate this book","I own every cookbook from Prudhomme, and this is by far the worst. If you want a diet cookbook, look elsewhere. The fruit syrups and other substitutes he has you make will go bad in your refrigerator before you use them. The taste of the finished products? Yuck! If you want Cajun food, fit it into your calorie budget or exercise more."
5,Paul breaks new ground with spices.,"Paul has broken new ground in writing this book. He forced me to go out and purchase a whole cabinet of spices. I thought I knew spices and had a stash of them. I didn't realize how many spices I was missing out on and how to use them. The recipe for basic stock actually helps with the creation of basic items, such as boiled potatoes or vegetables. The discussion on the use of fruit juices for adding the missing `Fat' flavor in low fat foods is innovative.I suggest this to any aspiring cook that wants to spice up their kitchen. My favorite recipes include the Bronzed Veal Chop, the fried Tilapia and the Boiled Turkey dinner."
5,A Highly Professional Guide and an Excellent Buy,"Having had little to no experience in web site design and creation this book gives a thorough grounding in all aspects of commercial web site creation. It abounds with resources and ideas. A highly practical ""grammar"" to dealing with all stages of site creation, from initial concept through to creating a sophisticated web site mechanism which works!!.A straightforward nononsense approach is adopted throughout. An excellent buy and excellent value for money. Thank you very much to Kim Hampton-et-al and I am looking forward to purchasing the 2nd Edition."
5,A Paradise lost,"Hiram Goza's terrific new novel, Birds of Paradise, is a tour de force of haunted memory, disconnection, longing, and absurdist humor. The prose is crystalline; the plot more than the sum of its parts. Set in New Orleans and South Louisiana, the book follows four characters whose lives intersect in funny and desperate ways as they try to assemble themselves in the face of frustrated love and pasts that will neither leave them in peace nor reveal any usable meaning. Hiram Goza's the writer we've been waiting for and Birds of Paradise reinvents the novel from something as fragile as memory."
5,"Jerusalem, Center of the Word, and Walking the Bible - DVD","I purchased both dvds. The first one on Jerusalem is absolutely fantastic. A joy to watch especially after having just returned from Israel. A great collection of pictures to be watched more than once. The second DVD ""Walking the Bible"" unfortunately did not come close. Primarily because of the quality of the DVD. The journey is well done and the pictures would be fantastic - except - that my DVD was of poor quality. I got a lot of ""snow"" on the left side of the screen which made it difficult to look at. I had hoped that its quality would improve through the different sections, but unfortunately it did not happen. I purchased these DVDs together and had to wait a few weeks before being able to watch them. By the time I did, I felt perhaps it was too late to send the one back .. I believe it is a DVD of poor quality but the story remains wonderful and should also be kept in one's library."
4,Jerusalem 101,"This documentary is great as an introduction to the diverse history of Jerusalem. It is balanced almost to a fault, presenting the Jewish, Christian and Muslim histories in that order, as if they were separate episodes. If you already have a basic understanding of Jerusalem's history, there won't be much new for you here.Ray Suarez's enthusiastic and measured presentation prevents this from being completely didactic, which it tends to be.This documentary barely covers recent history but with its release date being 2009, that probably doesn't matter anyway; it would be dated in any case."
1,Did not fit the rifle,"The MTM bore guide for my 17 caliber rifle turned out to only slide down the chamber so far and then reached an obstruction and would go no further. The rifle is a Savage 17 HMR Model 93R17F. Before you purchase this bore guide look into the chamber with a flashlight and make sure there a no metal pieces protruding into the chamber. If not, it should work."
3,Looks good but quality suspect,The chairs take about 15 minutes each to put together. All 4 chairs I ordered had one leg slightly shorter an are rickety - i tested it in multiple areas sobits not the floor. One chair came chipped and I still haven't received something to mask this. Chairs are lightweight and easy to move and comfortably holds me at 190 lb
5,Great bar stools,"Excellent product - great value. The chairs came in a few days, all parts included, no damage and easy assembly.I would order more if I had need for them. Impressive!"
5,Coaster counter height stools,I love the 6 Coaster counter height stools that I ordered. I have only put together 2 of them because I am waiting until I can get the table to go with them before putting together the other 4 of them. I built a brand new home and wanted to have a few new furnishings to go in it and the table and stools were a part of some of the things I wanted. I will be ordering the table soon hopefully. I don't have enough credit available on my Amazon credit card right now...otherwise I would have ordered the table too. Keep up the good work Amazon...I love being an account holder with your company.
4,Great product,"The chairs were easy to assemble and very sturdy, I added a little wood glue to the leg supports during the assembly. Shipping cost was a bit high but the product itself is very good. I give the stools a high rating."
5,great buy,"fair price, good quality, easy to clean. Easy to put together. would reccomend, they also look good quality in my opinion and match some other dining chairs I have owned for years prior."
5,Very nice chairs!!,Purchased for my daughter and she really likes them. Sturdy than she thought for the price. Would recommend these stools.
5,Coaster counter height chairs,These chairs look very nice and are a great chair for the price. In fact I thought the price included only one chair instead of two and mistakenly ordered too many. My husband was able to put them together quickly without any problems. I am very happy with them.
4,Easy to Assemble,"The chairs are extremely easy to assemble, for anyone who has had experience with IKEA furniture. They also came with great instructions and the necessary tools. It also came very well packaged with the backs assembled already. The chairs are good looking and good value for money. I shopped around and similar chairs were easily around $90 each."
2,Nice looking but could be better made,"This chair, like all the other reviews have said, is very good looking. It was also a great price. The wood is sturdy and it was very easy to assemble. The one thing I didn't like, which for me is a deal-breaker, is that the seat cushion does not have any support under it. You basically hammer in the seat cushion to the chair with tiny nails and then that's it. There is no support underneath besides the frame of the chair. I am afraid that one of these days we are going to sink through! The bottom of the seat is very flimsy, too, so you can't really trust it; it's super light with what feels like cardboard with some padding on top of it. If I knew it was going to be like this, i would have returned it, but we already assembled it so it is too much of a pain to return, plus shipping and handling was like $23, so we would have spent $46 for nothing to send it back."
4,Nice Looking Stools,I purchased 2 sets of these counter height stools (4 stools in all). I am very happy with the purchase. They seem sturdy and well made and should last a long time.I deducted one star because some of the installation steps are a little tricky and I believe could be fixed with a better installation design. One of the stools is also wobbly due to a leg which is slightly shorter. At some point I will probably just glue a small piece of wood or something on the bottom to fix the issue.Overall I am very satisfied and would buy them again
4,great stools for for price,These stools are a great buy. They look beautiful in our new kitchen. The price is very reasonable and overall we are extremely happy with our choice. The one negative is they are difficult to assemble.
2,Change Advertisement,Very upset when I receieved these stools and they were not the color that they were advertised to be. Says cappuccino and they were no where near cappauccino
2,Started off strong but declined,"This movie was all about the dot com era. I thought I would see more on entrepreneurship, but it showcased the life of a aspiring star. Definitely not a unique story. It was just ok."
3,The Book of Occasional Services - 2003,"I was disappointed in this so-called update to The Book of Occasional Services - 1994. The only thing updated was a Spanish language section of the services. So if you have a 1994 BOS, don't bother to purchase this one. Of course, if you don't have one, I'd buy the 1994 one used, unless you have need of the Spanish language section."
5,Perfect companion to the Book of common Prayer,"It's amazing how much you can learn from this book. It doesn't matter if you are a cradle Episcopalian or a newbe, you will be amazed at how much you didn't know.I have both a hard copy as well as ebook. Either way you can't go wrong."
2,Caution with factory refurbished unit,"Arrived quickly from the seller. It was technically was as promised. Unfortunatley, performance was poor. There was a horrible motor whine. Also the recording quality was MUCH worse that my heavily used, and abused 25 dollar portable unit. My transcriptionist, who almost never complains, could not hear me well (and I dictate clearly).Right now, my M-2020 is at Sony. I had to mail it there for service. Very hard to contact vendor. At least Sony seems to be evaluating the unit (it is under warranty for 90 days)."
4,Recent purchase,Seller delivered as promised with no problems. Item was as promised. We already own one of these machines and we were glad to find another when office supply stores stopped carrying them
4,good product,"Item was received in working order. The first one was not working. I sent it back andthey had me a replacement within a couple of days. Good, fast service."
4,Two Italian Masters makes magic,"The late Italian film music maestro Nino Rota's beautiful melodies - played by the incomparable flautist Severino Gazzelloni. This is a combination that can hardly go wrong. And it doesn't. So, all you who want to have a great aesthetic experience, without any gimmicks but just listening to the pure perfectionism of both the music and its interpretation (Gazzelloni's soulful playing accompanied by his longtime accompanist, pianist Luciano Michelini): buy this disc. Italian cultural heritage and artistic quality at its best."
2,buyer beware,"This collection of John Burke's own stories should not be confused with a collection of other writers' stories edited by Burke called Tales of Unease (Pan Books, 1966). Unfortunately, many of these stories are rather undistinguished (which accounts for the 2-star rating above). Burke's collection of his own stories, which I haven't read, sounds much more intriguing."
1,ouch,"I read reviews saying these were great walker shoes, but all I got were blisters on the ankles where it rubbed. I walked around for two days and I don't wear them anymore because of the rubbing on the ankles. Look at the top part and you'll see what I mean."
2,Shoes,"After wearing these shoes for only an hour or two, I began to smell something ""funky."" Turns out it was the shoes. This hasn't ever happened to me with any other shoes, so I'm pretty sure it was the shoes and not my feet. I haven't worn them since. In the meantime, I'm going shopping for some sort of product I can spray into the shoes to keep them from smelling."
3,"Nice looking shoes, great price,...too WIDE","These are nice looking shoes, well padded and great price too. However, the propet shoes seem to be wider than other brands. I had purchased a pair of Hush Puppies a month earlier that was EE, but it was too narrow and my feet hurt from wearing them. So I ordered a EEE for the propet shoes, but it was way too wide and my feet were sliding in those boats. I am giving both pairs away to friends."
5,Best work shoes,"These are my husband's favorite shoes. He wears orthotics, and this particular shoe is best for him. Because the orthotics lift his heel inside the shoe, he prefers shoes that come up higher around his heels. He is on his feet all day long, and these shoes provide the comfort and support that he needs. They are sturdy and well made, and they wear well. As long as Propet makes this shoe, he will continue buying it when his worn shoes wear out -- and that takes at least a year of extremely hard daily wear!"
5,Loved this movie,Very good movie would recommend it to anyone who loves the paranormal experience and the two disc series was great
4,The movie was good,"This is a good movie quality and sound are good, no scratches on the disc. Great movie to add to your collection and a great deal at only a penny."
3,Needs color,"Wow, talk about a trip down memory lane! Although I enjoyed revisiting the adventures of the world's most human superhero, the experience would have been much improved if the book had been printed in full color and on decent paper. Of course, then it probably would cost twice as much. Personally, I still would have bought it, because not only would reading it have been much more enjoyable, the collector value would have been much higher.Three stars for resorting to cheap newsprint style paper and low-grade inks."
2,No good for Communicator,"I bought this memory card for my Nokia 9500 because on Sandisk's website it says that its compatible. Tried and tried for a few hours. The device sometimes sees the card and most of the time it doesnt. When it does see the card, it gives a ""UNABLE TO BEGIN FORMATTING"" and ""SYSTEM: ACCESS DENIED"" error. The card is not defective, it works on 3 different brands of readers and reads/writes fine on 3 seperate computer systems... and will be used as the memory core of a DIY USB flash drive. I do not recommend this card for users of the Nokia Communicator series (9300/9500)."
4,Fairly good memory card,"this memory card is pretty good considering size of the card, vs. cost. The card works well with the phone, and is a great buy!"
5,That Voodoo that You Do So Well!,"""Fifty Million Frenchmen"" is Cole Poter's first complete Broadway score and one of his best! It has the lovely ballad ""You Don't Know Paree"" ( a song that I'm sure was very close to Cole's heart, being a lifelong admiere of Paris), the racy cabaret ""Find Me a Primitive Man"" and ""You've Got That Thing"". I guarantee that ""Where Would You Get Your Coat"" will have you in stitches. Plus, it has ""You Do Something to Me"" which contains the famous line ""Do do that voodoo that you do so well"". If you can find a copy, I suggest that you snap it up quickly!"
1,Thank God He Is No Longer A Lawyer!,"What a terrible display of dishonesty. John Dean wants to be a TV Star or Circus Showman but he is not aProphet of the Truth. This book is a Novella of pump and padded pages and thus a cheat within itself. This is a venture into the world of the fast buck and certainly is not a concern of mine. I prefer Gordon Liddy's version of events and in truth Liddy has been proven right based on recent facts. John Dean has been proven to defend a lying President cited for Contempt for lying under oath by a Federal Judge as he did Clinton. Consequently, he was a very poor Lawyer back in the 1970's and thank god he can no longer represent people. He is without principles or backbone and knows it and tries to cover it up with this book."
2,Dean was likely the principal bad guy here.,"Nixon will always take the blame for the dishonorable acts of Dean and others. The book is interesting for the authors discussion of how power corrupts. But don't assume that he presents the true facts to us. Certainly G Gordon Liddy says this book is untrueful. Liddy recommends that one read Silent Coupe for the most likely truth.Dean occasionally appears on TV as commentator of current events and oftens comes across as a spokeman for the democrate party, that he once ordered others to bug.Only for students of the Watergate era."
1,Un robo completo,"Pagar $5.95 por 2 páginas que no dicen nada, lo considero deshonesto. En el revisado de la editorial mal intencionadamente ponen pagina 32, para confundir al cliente y hacer pensar que es un documento de 32 paginas. Esa actitud es contraproducente con el titulo del miserable documento de 2 paginas. ""Me siento estafado""."
5,Restaurant rice at home.,"RiceSelect Royal Blend is my favorite rice. It's like rice you'd get in a fancy restaurant, but you can make it easily at home in about 20 minutes. Per cup of rice, I add a tablespoon of chicken soup base to the rice water and the result is perfection every time. Try Royal Blend and I'll bet it becomes your favorite rice too."
4,An excellent product,"We were quite pleased with this product. It was tasty & quite flavorful.We highly recommend this ""Rice Select Royal Blend"" !!!"
5,Yummy,You don't need to put a lot of seasoning or spices for this blend. I just put water with some coarse garlic salt. The nutty smell is incredible and the taste is so heavenly. Yum Yum!
2,"The rice taste great, but the containers have gotten smaller!","The rice taste great, but the containers have gotten smaller since the last time I ordered. Last year I received 32oz containers, but now they are 28oz. when you zoom in on the picture you see a 32oz label. I realize the description says 28oz, but you would think the label would match the picture. The rice does taste good, but for the money, I think I will start buying at Wal-Mart."
4,Great Rice Blend,"I have actually ordered two cases of this twice, and will probably order another two cases some time soon. It is the only quick cooking rice blend that includes wild, red and brown rice. It is very tasty, easy to make, and I make it often.I do not follow their cooking directions, however. I brown the rice mixture in butter before adding the water.My only complaint is that it does contain white rice. I would prefer not to eat white rice. I would like it even better if it were organic."
5,Healthy and tasty,"Have been using RiceSelect Royal Blend for years as the healthier, tastier alternative to plain brown rice and plain white rice. After my local supermarket stopped carrying it, I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com -- at a lower price than in the supermarket."
1,Flawed!!!,"While this machine is fine in most respects it has some huge flaws. It never turns off completely, when switched off you can still hear something running inside. It is either the fan or the hard disk that never stops, if you get close enough to the machine you can hear the hum. I know that electric motors can run for years, but it will eventually burn out. Thats not to mention that an always running fan will draw a great deal of dust into the unit after a while.Another flaw is that it doesn't have the ability to devide a program on the hard disk. It can only be done on the RW disks.I also own a PIONEER DVR-510h and a PANASONIC DMR-e100h and think they are better than the SONY in every way except for the smaller size on their hard drives."
4,"Love It ! ""Fast Dub"" ? + Update","We bought this primarily for the ""Fast Dub"" feature that supposedly lets you to dub a video recorded from the Hard Disk to a DVD-R at a faster dub speed (up to 12x) is the figure I read when purchased.Where is it? I have never been able to find it & the manual just mentions it as ""Fast Dub"" is available on appropriate recordings, but they never mention what the appropriate recordings requirements actually are to use ""Fast Dub"". If someone knows how to use it, please post it here. Dont buy if this feature is important to you. Otherwise it works well.**Update To Fast Dub Situation**To access Fast Dub start dubbing from ""System Tools"" dialog instead of starting from the ""Title List"" dialog. This works 99% of the time. You won't see a disc is dirty error. I have no idea why this works and not through the Title List dialog."
3,DVD Burners All Failed!,Recording on the HDD works well but the Sony DVD burners all failed and there are no replacements. Some say the Sony DRU-510A will work but they are from 2004 and hard to find still in working condition.
5,An excellent bedtime story for young children,"This book is an excellent bedtime story book for young children, with a happy and appropriate ending. Four kittens named Buzz, Fuzz, Suzz and Agamemnon and their mother Samantha make up a cat family. Using photos of the heads of cats with figures posed in various actions, the story of their lives is told. They go to school, play and help their mother. When Samantha's birthday is coming up, they work together to create catnip birthday cakes and make up some presents appropriate for a mother cat. At the end of the book, it is the end of their day and Samantha is tucking them in for the night. The last caption is:Did you enjoy this story?Good!Now go to sleepThe combination of the photos of the kittens and the short captions are what makes this an excellent bedtime story. It is long enough to develop a storyline yet short enough to be read quickly. As someone who read a lot of bedtime stories, I can appreciate a good one."
2,Yawn,"I read the first fifty or so pages, and then I just skipped to the end. There were so many ... mystery cliches that I just got intensely bored. Too bad the book didn't live up to the catchy cover."
3,Faggots Die!,"A gay private eye loses a prospective client to murder and, curious, he cruises the gay bars of New Orleans for shreds of gossip that might lead to a solution. The mystery is satisfactory but the pace is slowed by a lot of gay angst. Every male in the city seems to be young, buff, tanned, cute and in possession of a sugar daddy; some variety would have been appreciated. That said, there are a few characters we can like, and I am assured by fans that future enteries in this series are much improved."
1,Simply awful,"Thin on plot, this book (which I see from other reviewers is the author's first novel) is unbearably weak. The writing is unpolished and the characters one-dimensional. Maybe his other books are better, but frankly, this one has pretty much soured me."
3,Cats,"If you cats, this is the book for you!! This book tells you about many different kinds of cats: tabby cats, persian cats, kittens and many more are included. This book also tells you how and what to feed your cat. It teaches you how to handle cats too. I recommend this book for you!!"
3,Untitled,"John Wetton has played bass and sung with groups as diverse as Roxy Music and Uria Heep but is perhaps best known for his work with Asia. From 1972-1974 he was a member of King Crimson where Palmer-James began adding the words to music mostly composed by Wetton and guitarist Robert Fripp. This disc is a fine collection of demos and live versions of some of the tunes that the pair have had a hand in over the years. The earlier King Crimson demos consist of little more than Wetton on piano and vocals,intended as guides for Palmer-James to write his lyrics to. For Crimson fans it is of course more than worthwile to hear these early and very basic takes on what would become classic material.The disc provides an unexpected degree of satisfaction in it's overall feel and style and certainly enhances the reputations of both gentlemen. The later live material in particular is very good."
3,Interesting sales book,"After implementing just a few of this book's techniques, I went from signing 5-8 clients per month to signing 16-20. When I finally caught my breath, I tried some of the other tips and last month alone added over 10 new clients!"
5,Samurai Selling,Samuarai Selling gets to the heart of sales - what it is to service people and enjoy a win-win situation all around. We give it to all of our sales people as a welcome gift to our company. I re-read it once a year and always learn something new and enjoy the satisfaction of seeing that I really have incorporated the Samuarai Selling Principles into my every day activities. It's a success!
2,A Waste of time,"You tell ME. How are samurais and salespersons related??Still wanna buy this book? Come on... practice it, dont read it"
3,If this is a book by a Christian it is good (God),"if not then may fire and damnation be upon thee.Sales is good, but not immoral things. Sales is good if you sell God and Christ."
5,"VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD!","This is a terrific book! It tells the story about Cindy and Storm and their friendship before Storm lived at Whitebrook. It has the message that if something is very wrong, you can't just act like it never happened. You have to do something about it! Anyways, it was a VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD BOOK! Sarah :) P.S. THOROUGHBRED BOOKS RULE!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!,I loved the book. Cindy must really love Glory. I would have slapped Lavinia Townsend!!!!!! The book is great.
5,Cindy and Glory,I love the way Joanna wrote this book. Cindy accused of stealing a watch when infact she stole a horse. This shows how far love will go to save someone. Cindy fell in love with this beautiful horse and when Glory appears at Whitebrook she just can't let him go back to his owners. Cindy hid him to protet him. In the end he was found at Whitebrook but instead of returning him they dug deep into his past and found out that he was stolen. In this book you see Cindy willing to risk anything to save the horse. I think Cindy and Glory were Champions from the begining. I can't wait to see what's in store for them.
3,Who really wrote this?,"I have a hard time believing that Joanna Campbell really wrote this book. The writing style is very different from all the previous Thoroughbred books.It was a good book, story wise, but the change in style really bothered me, especially toward the end.What I don't understand is why the later books in the series are written by other people. Why did Joanna Campbell sell-out her series to other writers?"
3,Lovely! Quite Darling!,"I really like this darling little novel! I can relate to Cydney.And as for Glory,all I can say isWHAT A SWEETIE PIE!If I had a horse,it would be him.HOWEVER-Cindy can be a little tempermental. I dont care for her."
2,DOWPOW,"I'll cut right to the chase. No adjustment for tone. Needs more bass in the speakers. The display at night will replace any nightlight you have on in the room. It is REALLY bright.I have to cover the display to go to sleep. The unit has a button for display but no reference to to what it does in the manual, it just shows that it is there? Called the manufacturer, talked with two different people and they informed me the button does not function on this model???"
3,it SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,"well the radio is horrible and it won't play my burned cd's.it's ok, i'm twelve years old, so don't start thinking that you're reading a review from a five year old (he he).The screen is very difficult to read. After about a week or two, both hinges broke on the top of the cd cover. Now, it won't close, and just stays opened all the time. It's pretty annoying, and to get it to play my cds, i have to put like, a dictionary and lava lamp to hold it down, LITERALLY!!!!!!!! And really, I'm not kidding. But on the positive side,the sound is OK. It doesn't take up much space on my nightstand,either.If you were getting ready to buy this product, in my opinion, you shouldn't.It was a waste of money and i hate it.Especially for that price,too. Ok,well,you don't have to take my word for it, you can buy it, but my suggestion for you is not to.Thanks for listening,Heather S."
3,Poor unit for this price.,I agree with all others on this unit. Nice sounding speakers but the radio reception poor. No dimmer switch and the display button is for displaying the cd tracks if anyone needs to know. But over all alarm is loud enough to wake the heavy sleeper. They need to make these radios with pull out antennas.
2,Not a great product,"Display way too bright, sound quality just okay. The one that I bought, I returned because the clock was really fast. The only thing I really liked about it was the big display (except for the fact that it lit up the whole room)."
1,I wish I had read reviews before buying this,"This is a terrible, terrible product, and I wish I had read reviews before making the purchase. Unfortunately I was in a hurry to buy a CD player/clock radio. Just as almost everyone else is saying, it became 'tempermental' after only a few uses. First the CD player wouldn't play certain CDs (yes, these were all commercial ones). Then it stopped playing CDs altogether. Then it stopped playing AM/FM radio. Then it would change the time every few days. This thing is a nightmare."
2,Transcriber,Thought the machine would be more updated. The sound volume is poor quality - I have all the way up to 10 and can at times barely makeout the words being spoken. If I didn't need the machine I would return it for my money back. Had a Lanier Dictaphone Transcriber unit which was A-plus.This was to have replaced that great machine but does not come close. The foot pedals are always moving around and I have to manipulate them all the time to press the pedals.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE,My boss bought this for me to transcribe medical records. It worked fine for 6 months or so but now you can not hear clearly; muffled sound and the volume goes up and down. From the beginning when you set the volume high you still could not hear good but has now become unbearable and totally hard to hear. It is not worth the money. You may have to spend more initally for a good machine but in the end you want be wasting the money you spent on this one.
2,Not so great transcriber,"I've been transcribing with an Olympus for six years. I needed another machine, so I bought the Sony M-2000...not a great product for the money. Even if you have the volume turned all the way up to 10 (highest), you can't hear the person very well and there's a muffled quality, even with the tone on high. I can't believe the difference in the quality of sound between the two. I'm disappointed with the Sony, and I actually bought it because I thought Sony would be better! Ha!"
1,Look elsewhere,"Unfortunately, the office needed to replace the prior transcription machine and this is the unit that was bought. No matter what we tried, even with the volume up to 10, you just cannot hear. So, I now have to use my Bose earbuds to do my work. Not really fair for the money spent on the unit. Look elsewhere."
2,"Ok, but not great","This transcriber gets the job done, but if you do a HEAVY amount of transcribing, then spend more money and get something better. Even with the volume turned to 10, I still have difficulty hearing. Just the noise from my keyboard alone when I'm typing makes it even more difficult to hear. If you work somewhere with a LOT of background noise (phones ringing, co-workers talking, office machines buzzing away), this machine will be VERY frustrating."
4,Volume is the problem!,This item is a great item except for one thing. The volume is not good. You have to turn it all the way up to hear it adequately. I am glad to see that everyone has this problem and its not my hearing though!
2,Audio was poor,I was very impressed with how fast the product arrived! It was basically all set up and ready to go. I was very disappointed with the audio. There were times when the tape sounded so muffled I couldn't catch the voice. When I backed it up and replayed it the sound was noticibly better. It was kind of a pain to have to keep rewinding so I could get a fairly clear sound. Don't have time to return it. Will be looking for a different machine in the near future.
2,VPN connections work intermittently,If you want/need to create VPN (Virtual Private Connection) and telecommute - don't buy this router - the feature may not work. It's briefly mentioned in the router's manual - but I don't use the type of VPN connection described there and still don't get connected. Otherwise online experience is fine. By the way instead of this router a bought one from D-Link and have not had any problems since day one.
1,Not working properly after 1 1/2 year,"I got this router and vonage service for about a year and a half. For the most part, it worked OK - vonage voice quality and the router, except I have problem with the fax and it didn't work with my security monitoring service. But starting a week ago, the router started to lose packets and connection -- and I have to reboot the router every 2 hours or the phone line will not work. I called Vonage and they said the warranty of the router has expired and I'll have to pay another $50 just to get another router/phone adaptor, or I can bid and get one off eBay. I tried Sunrocket before and the sevice is much worse than Vonage -- frequency of drop, voice quality, customer service. I may consider switching back to the landline with AT&T."
1,Worst product,"I don't have any problem with phone service. The wireless part of the apater is not upto the standard. ..Stay away from this product like many other suggested .. If i had read these reviews before, i would not have bought this proudct.."
1,"No, thank you","May 30, 2007If you already started the bad Vonage trip, be sure to close out yourdebit card BEFORE you attempt to cancel. They are experienced atgetting there before you can. You'll open your account and find thoseadd-on surprise fees for cancelling their very bad product/service.PLEASE keep records and file complaints. This is dirty business."
1,STAY AWAY FROM VONAGE: AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Believe me, you do not want Vonage service. You will curse your luck that you ever signed up for it. I bought this unit few months ago. The vonage service worked for few days and then unit started giving trouble. It would not work half the time. Then one fine day it stopped working. I still have my land line so I wanted to cancel the Vonage account. I called the account dept several times but nobody would pick up the phone. I waited a total of 7 hours trying to get hold of somebody who would take my call. The only live person I could get to were from technical support who were of no use. On top of all this I was told that there is cancellation fee of $40. I still cannot figure out how to cancel my account. Looks like I will have take the vonage account to my grave.SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT"
1,Vonage is a scam,I have had nothing but trouble from Vonage. They take forever to transfer your current number(I waited 4 months and it never transfered)while you still have to keep your current phone service. If you cancel in less than a year they charge you 40 dollars. Vonage is not customer friendly. It's hard to get a hold of their customer service group. Their corporate phone system is unreliable. The operators won't let you speak to their superior and they won't bend policies to make customers happy.
1,WRTP54G - The worst of the worst,"I am so disappointed by the performance of this ""LINKSYS CISCO"", mentioning the name as this name is often taken as a quality name, that i wanted every one else know that please don't buy this product, i have the following issues:1. Wireless keeps on droping 15-20 minutes.2. Ethernet connection is ""DEAD"" after 2-3 days of usage, so have to reboot both the WRTP54G and cable modem.3. Phone is some times choppy and echo is very common.Please stay away from this WRTP54G and related products."
2,Horrible wireless router.,"This is the worst wireless router I've ever used. I drop connections every 15-20 minutes, and I can NOT get a VPN tunnel to work through it. Luckily I had my old Netgear available so I have it working as my ""real"" router and I just use this device as my Vonage adaptor. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay away from this device."
1,Vonage is a SCAM,"We started using Vonage in Feb. 2006 and we could never get it to work, their tech support would always tell us to unplug the box and we neede a faster internet connection, finally after 4 months of fighting it we went back to our local provider...then every month we were still getting charged for our Vonage service. Vonage would tell us that they never received the cancellation calls and that we were still using the service(which was disconnected from our computer) They lie through their teeth and we still haven't resolved the issue. Do a search on Vonage complaints and you'll see we aren't the only ones."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this device!","If you use a VPN connection to work from home, don't buy this device. I did thinking it would be nice to upgrade my router, but ended up wasting both time and money trying to make this device work properly. If you have a router that is working just go with the phone adapter. I would hate to total up all the time lost trying to get this to work (and I am IT savy). My stubborness prevented me from crying uncle as early as I should have. So if your considering Vonage or any VoIP service, run don't walk away from this device."
1,Junk,I moved and my roommate used this router. Its very unreliable and the range is poor. I couldn't add a password because it kept locking up when i accessed the router configuration page. I contacted linksys asking for some written troubleshooting help and they responded by giving me a fee based support phone number. I dug out my old WRT54G (at least 5 years old now) and now im up and running.
1,Glad it's not just me...,Everyone else has said it all and with far more tech knowledge. Constant wireless and phone issues. I have had Vonage for 4 years and almost every router dies on me. The WRTP54G has been a problem since day one. Vonage blames the Linksys device and Linksys says it is because of my ISP/Vonage.
2,Be prepared to replace often,"Ugh, I've been using Vonage for four years now and have had four of this unit and it's predecessors. The unit will work great for a year and then all of a sudden something will die, never to work again. This time around all four of the ethernet ports died. Last time both phone ports died. I never even used port 2. When I called Vonage about it the tech tried to switch me from port 1 to port 2 so I could continue to use the router only to find it dead.This time around I've bought the D-Link. I had hoped that Linksys would get better when Cisco bought them out but apparently that is not to be."
4,Seems to work well for me,"I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews of this product. I have had a variety of other cable and dsl modems, as well as two other VOIP products. Three years ago, I tried Vonage and quit because the modem's phone function did not work when the computer was plugged in. With this Linksys, setup was a snap. I have only had one major problem, and I traced it to the fact someone else had set up a network on the same frequency I was using. I changed my frequency and all is well. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the range and wall penetration are somewhat limited. I have been using it for 9 months."
1,Returned it.,"Bought this ""Linksys"" wireless router with Vonage VOIP phone connections. Thought I might sign-up for Vonage later. However, when I tried to download the latest ROM software for this box (as I do for my other Linksys boxes), Linksys tech support told me they only allow Vonage to update the ROM software on this box. I mentioned to them that it claims to be a ""Linksys"" box, they distanced themselves and told me to call Vonage. I told them I am not a Vonage customer, thus Vonage will not upgrade my ROM software. At that point, there was no one taking ownership for this box. I returned it for a full-refund. Linksys gave me an attitude, thus I bought and am now trying my first NETGEAR wireless box, working fine so far."
1,Constantly drops Ethernet connection,"I agree with the previous reviewer's comments that this product is defective. I have yet to have phone calls dropped, but I use my Vonage phone line for a Fax connection and don't use it as often, however, I'm very frustruated with the constant dropped ethernet connections. This happens regardless over ethernet cable connections as well as wireless connections."
1,RIP OFF HOSE CLAMP DISPAY,"Grossly Mis-advertised, I rec. one hose clamp in a envelope not a display as advertised only 18 days after ordering.

1,worthless piece of crap,I wish you would make a worthwhile product that unrolls in separate sheets instead of twisting and unwinding unevenly; for $4 a throw its a really crappy product. I would buy another brand if Fred Meyer had them available. Worthless product.
4,BallyK all the way!,This book is fantastic! I loved reading about my favorite show. I was able to get the book the last time I was in Ireland and I was so excited when I saw it. The book gives you all the information you ever wanted to know about Ballkissangel. The book has amazing pictures of everyone in the cast. It has pictures of the cast from different episodes and showing them when they are not in front of the camara. I recommend this book for anyone who is a big fan of BallyK.
4,1st Two Seasons Only,"I'm a huge fan of BallyK, but I was slightly disappointed with this little book. It's a good book for what it covers, but that's only the first two seasons of six. It gives quite a bit of info about the beginnings of the show and some thoughts from the actors as well as background concerning the area where it was filmed. I'd like to see another book that covers the rest of the series and I'm sure there are a lot of others that would agree."
1,this dvd sucks,"there was over 100 bands that played at skate and surf, why was this dvd so short! it's seriously lacking. espeically if you were there. there was a great deal of performances that were better than the ones that ended up on this dvd.i wish i would've saved my money!"
3,WTF!?!? THERE WERE MORE BANDS THAN THIS ON THE BILL!!!,"whose dumb idea was it to have 2 songs from like 10 bands?! i mesn the songs are good choices but the audio sucks and seeing the bands live is so much better. there were 3 days of amazing bands, WY AREN'T THEY ON THIS DVD?! story of the year, from first to last, yellowcard, taking back sunday, fall out boy, etc are so much better than slightly stoopid, pieballs, midfrown, hot rod circtit..dvds like this make me glad some stores buy, trade, and sell music"
4,Resource book,I bought this book for historical information and have not had an opportunity to read any part of it yet.
2,Of historical interest only.,"This book was obsolete before it was even published. It contains no material on nonstandard analysis, a subject which had been developed just a few years earlier, and nothing related to Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis, which was developed over the subsequent decade. The contributions give short shrift to the Arrow, the deepest of the paradoxes, and to the extent that the Arrow is discussed, the contributors miss the point entirely. (The point being that the derivative, which embodies instantaneous motion, depends classically for its definition on behavior at neighboring times.) Good information on the Arrow is still, to this day, hard to find. This book offers little or nothing to advance the topic. Cajori's history and modern research papers are much better sources."
5,Making cleaning MANageable,"I enjoyed the tongue in cheek manner used to prod me into becoming a domestic dude. The words amusing and practical both describe the book. I liked the advice about brand name cleaning products and tools. Now if I can only get my wife to read it and follow the advice, we'll be getting somewhere."
4,Not For Myself,"I bought this book for my single son who appeared to have a problem ""getting started"" in the cleaning process. i.e. ""where do I begin?"". He says he has found it most helpful and because of it he can keep ""the messes"" under control."
2,worst sound quality,I like a good detailed dvd when I'm exercising so I don't have to keep looking up at the tv to figure out what they are talking about. All I could hear most of the time on this one was echoing. It was like a video from the 80's I'm so disappointed. Just having a camera & a yoga mat doesn't qualify you to do a yoga video.
2,Not professional,"I was very disappointed in the video. The filming quality was poor, the set was unimpressive, the instructor did not seem entirely comfortable in front of the camara. There was little if any introduction--nothing was explained, movements were in quick succession and repetitive. The video seems liked something that could be put together at home. I also had thought that the video would involve partner yoga, but it wasn't, and didn't seem to have much to do with better sex, except for her mentioning the sexual core a lot. I think a regular yoga class could do about as good on this topic."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ITEM!,"This disco ball is everything I expected it to be! It's the perfect size, seems to be well constructed, and is tons of fun! I'm so happy I chose this one over some of the less expensive ones. My 7 year old niece plays it all the time. Educational? Maybe not like a leapfrog, but it definitely encourages her creativity! I would definitely recommend this product!"
2,Not what I hoped for.,"Ordered this for a surprise birthday party and was underwhelmed with it when I plugged it in. To start, the bulb was blown, right out of the box, and the ball would not make a complete rotation on the base. Had to replace the bulb and tighten some screws so It could rotate. It was not very bright, but I'll try another bulb and hope it gets better. Ultimately, my daughter just got a new nightlight for her room."
1,It didnt turn at all. I could just hear the motor running though,This semi big plastic ball is a waste of anticipation waiting for. I openned the box...pluged it in... and there was lights but NO SPIN in ANY directions. On the box in huge letters it says it turns in both direction 360 degrees... It didnt turn at all. I could just hear the motor running though.I have returned thios bogus product back. I hope I would get a refund
1,Bad Merchandise,"I thought this product would be a good idea as a gift. Unfortunately, the product wouldn't work when it was received by the recipient. What a waste."
1,el`cheapo,"We bought this because of size and price. We wanted to use this for my daughters 8th bday party and had plans to hang it upside down from the ceiling based on other people reviews of doing the same - however - as soon as we opened it up and plugged it in, the light blew out and the motor wouldn't spin the ball. I had open the base to see what was up. The motor teeth do not line up with the teeth for the ball. The glue that holds in in place broke off, misaligning each other. I tried to hot glue it back, but it would not work, i tried super glue, it would not work, I finally tried liquid nails, hot glue and lifted the motor up a few centimeters by adding spacers underneith the screw. Its currently working upside and does a decent job in our dark basement. For how long, not sure - but its very cheaply made and if your willing to deal with issues - it does the job, however I would not recommend this to other people."
3,Weird !,This was a really weird movie and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh or cry... It's a shame that this was Joan Crawford's last movie although she certainly had a successful career! This movie is difficult to find on VHS.I tried ordering it...through Amazon Marketplace...
2,The Making of Trog,"If you want to find out about the real-life tragedies and troubles behind the making of Trog, check out Curse of the Silver Screen - Tragedy & Disaster Behind the Movies by John W. Law in the book section."
1,Ed Wood would be proud,This film was one of the most dreadful things I have ever seen. It looks like they went to a Halloween store to buy a mask for Trog it is so bad. It is not even funny bad. What a sad end for such a great actress.
2,why?,"its funny how Warner Home Video takes time to release films like this but not other GOOD films,Like all of lana Turner's MGM days(Slightly Dangerous,Two girls on braodway,Dramatic School etc.) could have been released,instead of now beaing released on dvd-r,Same with Joan Crawford's films,they released ""Mildred Peirce"" and ""The Damned Dont Cry"" wich i am SO thankful for,But i would have LOVED to be able to buy ""This Woman Is Dangerous"" ""Goodbye My Fancy"" ""Forsaking All others"" ""The Bride Wore Red"" ""Harriet Craig"" etc."
4,Trog Rules!!,"For trashy ""B"" movie lovers - Trog Rules! It has all the elements one looks for in campy movies, with the infamous Joan Crawford center stage. As scientist Dr. Brockton, Crawford delivers a credible performance with all the poise of a legendary film star. The Trog creature is enjoyable to watch and actor Joe Cornelius does a fine job displaying a variety of emotions. The movie is of the Hammer Horror genre with some great scares (Trog jumping out of the screen at you several times), some skin (young British cave explorers strip down to their underwear), and blood (several gruesome Trog killings, especially the meat hook scene).With a veteran movie actress like Joan Crawford, a classic villain in actor Michael Gough, and a sympathetic monster - what more could you ask for??"
2,I hope she had plenty of Pepsi on hand...,"Poor Joan! After such a distinguished career, she went out with this dud as her final feature film. Bad everything, even though La Crawford keep a stiff, overdrawn upper lip throughout. It's fun as a comedy lampoon of horror flicks, which it never intended to be."
2,TROG??,"Of all the Joan Crawford films STILL not out on DVD they are releasing TROG???I am still waiting for her second Box set. Bette Davis has 2, why not Crawford?TROG, omg. What's next? Bezerk?What about Susan and God? Strange Cargo? Torch Song? Johnny Guitar? When Ladies Meet? Female on the beach? No, release TROG....good lord!"
2,One great film out of three (and it's not TROG),"It's really a shame that all but a few of the reviews for this release are written by Joan Crawford queens. TROG and THE BIG CUBE are cult trash, but CAGED! is a serious and exteremely well done film, perhaps the only ""women's prison film"" worth watching. Hope Emerson is truly scary, and you only know her from her comedy roles, you're in for a surprise.Unless you enjoy the schadenfreude of watching Joan Crawford and Lana Turner demeaning themselves, ignore this atrocity and try to find a used copy of CAGED!. If you're a serious film fan you won't regret it."
1,"Terrible ""Trog""; Joan deserved better","And you thought 1967's ""Berserk!"" was bad? One hasn't seen ""bad"" until ""Trog"" is experienced. We're supposed to swallow the notion of Joan as an anthropologist (!) caring after a troglodite. Yeah, right!"
2,Would have been better if Joan Crawford played Trog.,"Joe Cornelius, who played in such films as ""File of the Golden Goose"" (Gordie) with Yul Brynner, was selected to upstage Joan Crawford as that multi dimensional character (Trog).You have seen this story a million times. Innocent cave creature is tormented by child let lose on it by sadistic anthropologist. The poor creature must ""play ball"" or pay the consequences.Can't wait for the sequel where they have Joe Cornelius Vs the Piltdown man with William Shatner."
4,Trog,"Good quality video. Love to watch the old movies, Wasn't a bad one, not as scary as when I saw it as Kid"
2,Not that good of a phone,I have had this phone for several months and I cant stand it. I didnt actually buy it in the first place. It was a replacement provided by Sprint for a LG VI-125 that went haywire. The A760 is bulky. It takes for ever to get it out of my pocket.The sound quality is bad in every way. Voice quality is muddied. Downloaded ringtones are indistiguishable. And the sound quality while using a headset is weak at best. I put up with this b/c I don't want to have to drop another $200 on a phone nor extend my survice agreement by another 2 years. Why cant someone build a basic phone without charging an arm and a leg? The only redeeming feature on this phone is that it came with Tetris Deluxe.
1,Costly Mistake,"Worst TV ever....The set came highly recommended and for the first two years put out a beautiful picture... then, out of the blue we couldn't turn it on... It kept turning itself off. Tried to do a reset by unplugging it for the night to no avail. This unit cost us 2700 2.5 years ago and they want another $800 to repair it. It's just not worth it. I am very dissapointed in Hitachi and most likely will NOT purchase another Hitachi product. I work too hard for my money to be wasting $1000 a year for a TV that doesn't last. And, if you work hard for your money too, take my advise... Stay away from Hitachi."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"London's Portrait of Three Ladies (recorded on another New World CD) is a wacky, audacious near-masterpiece, and a reminder that there was a group of American composers, situated more-or-less in the Midwest, that felt free to dip into the innovations of the East Coast, the West Coast, Europe, or wherever. They didn't feel quite so implicated in the internecine debates that raged in the New Music world of the '60's and '70's (besides London, this group included Salvatore Martirano and Ben Johnston, among others). This disc presents 3 works from the '80's, and while they're eclectic enough in terms of musical language, they lack a certain personal je ne sais quoi.Moments could be by Berio, Penderecki, Gil Evans...you get the idea. I appreciate the open-mindedness. But my level of engagement wavers. Performances seem excellent. Nice writing, all of it. But a problem with proportions - the pieces wear out their welcome before the end."
2,Needed sizing,"Very pretty ring, but came a sa very small diameter and couldn't even be strethced so sadly had to be split.If it wasn't so cute. I would have returned it."
3,Good,It was alittle strong for my taste. Had to add a lot of cream and sugar. If it was cheaper I would buy again.
2,Overpriced,I was shocked when I went to the grocery store and found a much better price for the same thing. The coffee is great but the price was outrageous.
3,More coffee than toffee,"It's good, but lacking the real toffee flavor I was expecting. The coffee overpowers the toffee and is a bit too strong for my liking. For a Gloria Jeans flavored coffee my vote goes to Macadamia Cookie -- it's delicious."
3,Smells delicious,"Smells great, but taste pretty bitter. It goes well with a pralines or vanilla creamer. On it's own can be a little interesting."
3,Too weak,Was hoping for a little bolder flavor. I'm finding most of the flavored coffees are too weak with the exception of Millstone.
1,Not really that good,"This K-cup does not measure up like we thought it would. It's good if you add cream (sugar free) and sugar (splenda). If you can get it below 50 cents a cups and do not mind adding stuff, this will work for you."
2,Taboo or not Taboo,"After reading and sometimes rereading Ms. Rashkow's arguments on the Hebrew Bible and sexuality within the family, I can not help but come to the conclusion that I was only reading her oppinion. At many points within her argument it was very subjective and seemed as if it was not well supported and it left a lot of questions unanswered.She did, however, write the text in a very easy to read manner; she incoperated interesting analogies and easy to understand examples to try and help support her view points."
2,Revenge carried to the ridiculous,"I must admit that the writer has a compelling style. And the sex scenes are well done as far as I can tell, as I am not a gay male. There is an awful lot of violence and blood. Even for a vampire story, it seems a bit too much. I did finish the book and found it readable. I don't intend to read any more. The main character is not admirable. One can get in a snit over being rejected, then go on with more positive actions. To make vengeance the theme of ones existence is absurd and to prolong life to make vengeance a grand statement over thousands of years is beyond absurd. I don't like Victor so I won't bother with any more stories about him."
2,ok,"The book was fine, but really could have played on the entire 'Jesus' thing. The author wimped out on Jesus as a human."
1,Not worth it,"I've read quite a few vampire novels and this has to be the absolute worst. Not only was the main character unlikeable (rather an oxymoron for a vampire, but some authors give them redeeming characteristics), there was so much sociopathic violence it was offensive. I don't doubt that vampires are meant to be without conscience, but for me to enjoy a book, I have to be able to relate to someone in the book, and this one just didn't work."
1,nooooo.....,"while I, like most others, liked the twist... I could not even finish this book... nooooooo..... the story line bordered on creepy... just my opinion... if you like teenage/adult sex then this is the book for you.. for me nooooo..."
1,This Vampire's no Wow,"I tried to finish this book but the cliches and the poor writing simply made the task too difficult. A lot of the other reviews mentions faith, but I simply had none for the author in his choice of plot and characters. I don't understand hy this book is so popular, but then so is Christianity so maybe people have always been able to swallow tripe."
2,Huh?,"While I'm the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoy gay erotica, especially gay vampire erotica, I found this book difficult to digest. Perhaps it's my Christian upbringing, but I just couldn't make myself believe that a vampire was enamored with Jesus Christ. I found the book poorly written with a decidecly cliched plot. The author jumped back and forth quite a bit with the various story lines, and I found that disconcerting. All in all, not my first choice for a good read."
2,Uhhhhhgggggg.....,Reading this book was like having to choose between toe nail clippings and a slug for dinner. Very Dry and extremely boring. Unfortunatly I read this book till the end hopeing it would get better. It DID'NT.
4,Another great Novel from Linda Lael Miller,"I have recently become addicted to Linda Lael Miller's books. She has a style all her own. I read The Last Chance Cafe and they constantly reference the past ancestors who settled PrimRose Creek, so I decided this book would be a good book to read. Bridget's story is very romantic and it is an easy heartwarming read. It only took a day I was so wrapped up in her story. I plan on reading ""Christy"" next and will also leave a review for that Novel. Since I had read The Last Chance Cafe what happened w/ Bridget's story was no shock to me because they constantly refer back to it in The Last Chance, however, it was still a very nice read."
3,not very animating,"It is a tragedy that this book was published in 1969, before Mao's death in 1976I wish the author had an additional interview with Mao after 1949, the year of the founding of the People's Republic of China. So the reader do not know Mao's pattern of thoughts during and after the tumultous Cultural Revolution.I am still prefer books on Mao by Edger Snow and Jerome Chen"
1,Cheap looking!,I bought this as part of my husband's birthday gift. When I opened the box I was dismayed at how cheap and terrible it looked. I had to order another key chain from a specialty company immediately. This looked like it should have cost $5. I was embarrased to give it and disgusted to have wasted so much on something so crappy.
5,A must have guide,"This book is clear, concise and detailed. It tells you what you need to know to get the most from the software as quickly as possible.I took over my company accounts a few months ago, and none of the available books were much help - until this was published.Buy it - it's exactly what you hope it is."
3,I've heard better,"This is not a recording that you must buy. If you really enjoy russian liturgical music, you won't hate it, but there are a lot of recordings that you would be better served with. It is true that for an american choir, they do a fine job with the language especially. Their general tone and vocal quality was a little bit lacking for me. Their basses were ""ok"". I thought the singing was just a little too ""shouty"", even for russian music. I would recommend getting a copy of the vespers as sung by the Dale Warland Singers. Another american group. . . This is the most accurate recording I have heard, and it was done live which impresses me even more!"
4,It was an ok book,"This book is about a boy named Dennis Cookman who loves to pick on kids younger than he is, until Elizabeth and her friends decide that they are sick of Dennis picking on them and they decide that they are going to do something about him. Dead Man Cave is feared by all Sweet Valley residents, and so Aaron tells everybody that he is going to spend the night in Dead Man's Cave. They do this so that Dennis is forced to prove that he can spend the night in the Cave too! Then serious danger comes upon all of them, can they save Dennis?This book was really good because it shows that all bully's are mostly insucure about themselves, and telling a teacher is the right thing to do, not to take care of the bully yourself."
1,BAD-BAD-BAD,This is the worst FISHING game I ran into-& I have all 4 fishing games-The best one to this DAY is SEGA MARINA FISHING
2,Not to reel.,If you have ever played reel fishing on the PSX. This game is just a suped up version of that with new fishing areas. Not a very exciting game.
4,quick introduction to personal computers,"This is a really brief book that seeks to quickly get teachers familiar with the basics of personal computers. It addresses a skills gap in some teachers, who might have thus far avoided computer usage, and who now need to instruct their students.To be sure, this book by itself is insufficient to do so. Rather, it is best suited as an easy introduction to computers. After this, you should then turn to more extensive texts on various aspects, like the Microsoft Office packages."
4,Quite Remarkable,"I had heard many opinions about Marvel's massive ""Onslaught"" crossover, and it seems people either love it or hate it. I, for one, really enjoyed it. The sheer scope of the project is enormous, the art is consistently fabulous, and to top it all off, Onslaught is one of the best villains ever. Is it great? Yes. Is it ""The Dark Phoenix Saga""? No. I believe that comparisons of the two are what has given the Onslaught storyline such a bad rep (many also unfairly compare it to the ""Days of Future Past"" story arc). Regardless, volumes 1-6 of the Onslaught Collection are very worthy of purchase, even though at the moment, if you can manage to find them, the prices are sky-high. One minor quibble: For some reason, the ""Onslaught Epilogue"" one-shot isn't included in the last volume, so you have to read it and the ""Return of the Heroes"" trade paperback additionally to really see how the story unfolds."
4,After Western Maryland: Chessie System,"My collection is Western Maryland RR Based, yet this is a colorful and informative part of the collection because it includes information about WM's absorption into Chessie. Very colorful, this soft cover book's pictures include the beautiful scenery along Chessie System's rail lines. This book's pictures are of excellent quality. ISBN 0-9657709-3-1"
4,Corporate Spirituality,"This is a solid book on corporate spirituality, exploring the dynamics of spiritual formation in the church through disciplines such as serving, giving, praying, attending ordinances, hearing the preached word, learning, fellowshipping, etc. Some chapters are better than others (the best chapters are the ones on worship and prayer and the final chapter which gives guidance on how to research a church before joining it), but all are worth reading. The book is sprinkled with some helpful illustrations and great quotations from the Puritan/Reformed tradition. This is a good follow-up to Whitney's more popular book Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life."
3,Easy read,"Fairly basic thoughts on the church, but a good read for the novice on how one should interact within the church."
4,Good teacher resource,"This book is a good teacher resource for information on how other countries celebrate their Christmas holidays, but not a very good read-aloud. I teach 3rd graders and I found the vocab. and writing were a bit above the level of typical 3rd graders. Also, it was a bit dry. I would read it, but would edit it as I read it to them. However, it was a good source for information for my purposes as I presented the customs to the class."
5,Great Book!,"I bought this book for school for a unit that I was doing. With all of the other books I bought through Amazon, it was a great resource for myself and my students. Full Satisfied with the seller!"
2,Disappointed with this book : (,"I had hoped this book would have gone into greater detail about each countries' Christmas traditions. Also, it would have also been nice to include other countries that celebrate Christmas."
4,Fun for a teenager,"I bought this for my crazy, high-schooler sister-in-law and it was a smashing gift! If the bulb were a little bigger and brighter it would have gotten 5 stars, but it still works as expected and is the right size for an average bedroom."
1,no rotation,"it doesn't even rotate i just received it today, and i flicked it on and it didn't rotate, i tried to look if there was a buttuon to turn on rotation but nothing. Im disappointed and i am returning this item"
2,My daughter loves this,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present. She absolutely loves it. It seems a little jerky as it spins around, but I think that might be because my 3 year old was trying to sit on it. But so far, so good! We haven't had any problems with it, and the price was fantastic.follow up: well, it broke. the color discs keep falling out, and the plastic piece that hold the light bulb snspped off. I wish it had been better made, but ths is definitely not meant for a house with little children. I'm certain most of the damage is due to my crazy toddler, but still, it's very cheaply made."
4,disco fun!,"My kids love this disco ball, works well. We have only used it a handful of times, but seems to be holding up just fine."
2,Not worth the money.,"The level of entertainment this product can provide is that of kindergartens. Quality of the lights are ehhhh, way it looks is ehhh, you flip it upside down it will just go off. I' honest not sure if this is even worth 20 bucks lol I'd much rather save more money to buy something better"
4,It is exactly as expected,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The cord gets in the way a bit but it is nice to not have to worry about batteries.
2,Disappointing,"My daughter wanted this badly, it was really the only thing she asked for at Christmas. Unfortunately the small discs fall out quickly, and now a month later the disco ball doesn't work at all. Would be great, if it would only stay together."
4,yo this is such a boss toy,"Me and one of my pals bought it and it is so far out. It makes dandy light and when i used it for a chess club meeting, my pals thought it was sharp. If i were you, i would buy it."
4,Daughter Loved,Bought this for my daughter who is 10 and she just loves it. Works fine. It is plastic but works great. Turns the other way when you lightly stop the globe while on.
1,Don't buy this one.,"We will be sending this back. It has one of those strange lead cords with warnings of ""this could cause cancer and reproductive harm. After handling cord, wash hands immediately."" It also has exposed lead on the bottom. Too many warnings to keep in my house."
1,NO GOOD!!!!,"I would give it a zero if I could. I buy several thousand dollars a year from Amazon and this is by far the worst piece of crap I have ever received. It was broken, did not work at all. It is very dangerous for anybody to even try to use. I can't return it fast enough!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Fun - but broke on the first day!,"We bought this for our New Years Eve get-together with friends. It was fun to see with the lights off, but when one of the kids picked it up while it was on, it wouldn't spin anymore : ( Feel like I wasted my money and it went in the trash."
5,The best resource to start or enhance your consulting business,This book is highly recommended because outline the roadmap to succeed in the consulting business with accuracy.
4,A must read for consultants AND business owners,"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to differentiate the service or business.

1,Has anybody acrually seen this book?,"Does this book actually exist? I ordered the book as a result of a solicitaion. It was only $23.90 and guaranteed a refund if I was not satisfied with the product. Not a bad deal right? Well I went for it. I sent in my $23.90. My bank cashed the cash. But, I never got the product. When I retrieved the initial solicitation offer to follow up with my order, I could not find any contact information. No number, no address, no e-mail address, no website, nothing. Here I started thinking, I've been had. I wanted to post this on some website so others will not experience my fate."
5,godzilla vol. 1,great dvd to buy. it was shiped very fast to me. the sound very great and picture is very great too. and it is very funny too. the price is good to for the dvd. will tell al to buy to.
1,Best set I've ever owned!,"This is my first plunge into ""projection"" tvs. Once I saw the hitachi I read all I could on it. Hitachi makes 67% of all the guns used in porjection televisions, and it shows with this set.I couldn't be more pleased. The sound quality is lacking some what, but hook it up to your stereo or surround sound and just sit back and enjoy what this set does well, and that is produce picture quality that is many cases is better than sets costing 1k more.I shopped and got an excellent price [money] That included the set, stand, 5yr. warranty & free delivery. With a little effort you'll save tons of ....I've only had it in house for three days, but I'm in love. Gotry it out, you'll love it too. I especially love the split screen PIP."
2,So Close!,"I bought three copies of this as Christmas gifts.I absolutely love the pictures and style of the book. However, the pages are so hard to flip that I'm seriously thinking of returning all three. It has a D-type clip and the pages stick on the straight side. Also, they don't flip back when you close the book. You have to manually turn all the pages back to the right side of the binder.I have a blank recipe book similar to this which I was using just last night. It has the standard round clips. I flipped back and forth no problem. When I was done, I just closed the book and all the pages fell back in place.So I love the look - but not the function of the three I ordered."
3,Binding is weak,"I had to send the first book back because the binding broke before I ever even used it. You have to flip the pages carefully to avoid stressing the binding. I also would prefer more categories. Still, I am using it daily and like the big pockets for recipes that I cut out of the paper."
4,a great way to get organized,"I got this after I happened upon it and realized that everytime i tried to de-clutter I ran into tons of cut out and computer printed recipes all over.It helps to have somewhere to put all of these things. I *would* like it to be bigger and have more space for recipes of differnt types. That said, its pretty adorable and functional.For the cost, it was a good purchase and can sit on the book shelf with the rest of my cook books. I can imagine this as a good gift for a bridal/engagement shower, a person moving into an apartment for the first time or a child going off to school. Filling it with some of your favorites would be an extra nice touch."
4,What's Cooking? A Recipe Organizer,"I really like the organizer, but I agree with one of the other reviews that the pockets need to be reinforced.Also, I am already in need of filler pages. There isn't enough black recipe sheets for a person who would want this type of organizer. Where can I get more blanck recipe sheets? It is an odd size, so you really need to be able to purchase them from the manufactuer."
4,Great Keeper!,"I love the setup, its easy to flip to different sections, and there is a place to stick recipes in each section that one hasnt gotten to transfer over yet. The only thing I could find wrong with it was the space to write down ingredients in was kind of small, and it came to me one ring is permanantly bent open. However, I have big writing so that one thing could be my own fault :-D"
3,Can't turn pages!,"This book is cute, but, there are too many pages in it for the size of binder they use. It is impossible to even turn the pages. I am going to have to remove several of them before I can even use this book. I was disappointed."
4,What's Cooking?,What a cute way to organize all those recipes!A great gift for any hard-to-buy-for girlfriend!
2,Not very well designed,"I like the compartments and different sections of the book, but the book was too cramped and the rings were not big enough to hold all the pages."
3,Needs different Binder,"I love the graphics in this cook book. Unfortunately, the binder rings are a little off and too small to operate properly. I was really wanting to be able to add a few of my old recipe cards and there is no room.I am currently trying to figure out how to find a bigger binder with the same length and width. Pain in the backside."
4,Fun and practical!,"My hip 28 yr old daughter wanted a ""retro""/vintage cookbook where we would write in family recipes in each person's handwriting for her birthday. This cookbook incorporated tradition with fun. One of the divider pages had a quote about the fact that eating is so important to our culture, it's no wonder cookbooks outsell sex books 3 to 1. My daughter loved it! The category dividers are at the top of the book which is different. The pages are high quality and easy to write on and even my longest recipe fit on the page. The loose-leaf quality is excellent because we have more recipes for appetizers and desserts than we do for pastas so we could put pages in different sections. We really enjoyed this book which appears to be high quality and will last for years to come. Her sisters now want to scan the handwritten pages so they will have their grandmothers' recipes too!"
1,what does sex have to do with cooking,"there are several quotes in this book referencing sex...such as:""as life's pleasures go, food is second only to sex"",""anyone who eat three meals a day should understand why cookbooks outsell sex books three to one"",""kissing don't last: cookery do""I feel for a recipe file these quotes are not appropriate.Unfortunately, i purchased this cookbook for my daughter to begin a collection of family recipes.There should be a notation about these quotes being in the book so people can choose if they wish to purchase the book with these quotes."
2,Men Dressed as Women in the Kitchen,Here's a heads up! This book contains pictures of men dressed as women which is not clearly explained in the information about the book. All of the pictures (on each food type divider and cover) are of men dressed as women.
3,"Not Bad, but ...","This 19 inch ctr monitor is good for the price, but I'm not seeing that it lives up to high reviews. The shadow mask is uneven causing something like a sky effect with very thin cloud cover in spots. The upper left inch of screen is not as bright as the rest. And finally, the unit seems more prone to flicker than other 19 inch monitors I've had. Only at 100mhz do I get an unaffected image at my 800x600 preference. Otherwise colors are sharp, the unit is sturdy and, again, not bad for around $200."
1,Became Very Blurry,"My friends commented how blurry my screen was. I never noticed it probably because he came about slowly. But after connecting my old SONY Trinitron Multiscan G400 it was a night and day difference. It could be because I had this monitor sitting between two Event 20/20 BAS studio monitor speakers, but my SONY Trinitron G400 doesn't have any problems with clarity being between those two speakers. This Viewsonic monitor has a low quality, blurry image, and is now sitting in it's box out in my garage ready for the trash."
2,Green Corner,green corner in upper left side...i would think twice about a viewsonic monitor again....its too much trouble to ship it back
1,They didn't respond to my complaints,"I bought little bags of Charms cotton candy that took them a month to get it to me and then they were stale and crumbly.Throughout it all,they had nothing to say."
4,a lonesome adapter.,"In my opinion, doing online with the Gamecube would be great...but the problem is the amount of games available at the moment. There is only one game(that being Phantasy star online) and it costs an extra $$$ a month. Nintendo really needs to start working towards a wider variety of online games.Rumors have it that a Mario game, Mario Cart, Mario tennis, and Mario golf are going to be online...but all i want to know is WHEN!?Change the 3 star rating to a 4 if Nintendo does release those games, and change it to a 5 if decent third-party games are released on it."
3,SEGA,"I like the idea of being able to go online and play games, but one problem is that the only game available to play online is phantasy star online. It's a great game, but i really dont think its worth paying 40 dollars for the adapter, then an extra 8 dollars a month to sega. It would definately be worth buying if sega didn't charge the 8 dollars a month. There are also rumors of other games such as mario golf and mario kart coming out soon."
3,"Not the best option available, but ok.","This pillow is Ok, but not the best. It is simply a pillow with a speaker shoved in the back with a velcro closeure that hooks to your MP3. The sound quaility was not that great. The good side is that it is washable.We also purchased the Disney Princess speaker pillow and the tinkerbell speaker pillow for the same price through Target. I am MUCH happier with their quality and sound, and the speaker part is set more securely into the pillow.Wal-mart now sells speaker pillows with the same quality and look as this one for only $[...]."
5,great buy,"Okay, so I'm a kitchen gadget nut... absolutely this is at the top of my list! Simple to use and clean!!!! Plan on buying more to give as hostess gifts."
3,TINY AND WEAK!,"It is smaller and chincy...er... than I thought it would be. It minces a clove of garlic VERY well, but it's not so great with onions, even. Forget celery. If you want something that can cut anything, go bigger and sturdier!"
5,Love it,"Excellent for garlic and mincing veggies/herbs. Garlic comes out in a nice even cube shape. Very easy to clean, just make sure you keep it out of the dishwasher or it will warp.We ruined the first one in the dishwasher, my fault. Highly recommend for fast mincing."
1,Very disappointed,"If I could rate this product less than one star I would. I purchased this along with the Progressive brand (the one that has the extra blades, storage box, chopper box etc...and you would not believe the difference in products. This one is awful for chopping even something simple like garlic. The design of this product is all wrong, it is difficult to get pushed thru AND the clean up is a nightmare. Skip over this and go right to the less expensive, better bargain of the progressive international brand. You'll be happy you did."
3,Not so good...,"I bought this to chop vegetables such as garlic, radish, potatoes, etc. and it does not work that well for me. The plastic of the cutter feels fragile and it requires some pressure to force the vegetable through the blades, even the vegetables being small and soft. The blades did not seem to be sharp enough. I don't believe this plastic cutter could last too long. To clean it up takes a bit of time. Also, the cutter seems to be way overpriced... it's just a couple of plastic parts with tiny blades forming kind of a grill. Cheap in design and construction, expensive for what it is."
4,"Fast-paced, enjoyable, and extremely funny","Someone mentioned that the Chanur books aren't as good as the Faded Sun trilogy. I've been saving those for a dry period, and since Finity's End doesn't come out until August, it looks like I may get my chance.All that aside, I actually found this book more enjoyable than the previous Chanur books, although a great deal of that comes from seeing Hilfy all grown up and taking on responsibilities of her own. We also get to know Compact space better, particularly the rich and mysterious stsho (such an irritating bunch, but a lot of fun to watch).The commentary on gender relations is still a major theme, and I like how Cherryh has addressed it in this series; these books have, on the whole, a lighthearted approach to the subject that prevents heavy-handedness from weighing down the story.The ending, as with most of Cherryh's books, leaves an opening for a sequel. Will we see one? Time will tell"
5,MARITIME DUB,"IF YOU WANT TO FEEL THE SEA BREEZE, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE SUMMER EVENING SETTING SUN, IF YOU WANT TO SMELL A SMALL VILLAGE'S HARBOUR AND MOST OF ALL IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A TRIP TO YOUR FAVOURITE SEA COAST DESTINATION, THEN THIS IS THE RIGHT MUSIC YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO! ABSOLUTELY SOUL-DUB MASTERPIECE. WE ARE WAITING FFD's NEXT MOVE..."
5,"CRUISE,CHILL AND SMILE....BRILL!!!","If you wanted the ultimate chill album,but played by real musos(not remixed) If you wanted the ultimate summer album that invokes warm summer evenings or hot days at the beach...If you wanted the ultimate great road-trip album, that you can sing along too with a Pacific Reggae groove...then look no further, do yourself a favour...get this album...cheers"
5,Shake like a willow tree...,"I've been listening to this album regularly for over 8 months now and it just seems to sound sweeter with each listen.While the soul and warm sonics of this record are immediately apparent, the length of the tracks (generally 6+ mins) gives some indication that this release deserves some attentive listening in. Even today I find things I hadn't heard before. It's a soulful, fun, beautiful record. I feel a big part of the record's appeal is it's ""home made"" quality... you picture the group throwing this free-flowing record together in a shack by the beach, rather than an session with an overpaid produced in an overly expensive studio. It's catchy, yet offers the listener more and more with every listen. Reggae, soul, funk, with a sprinkling of jazz. Needless to say: I love this record."
5,BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!!,"One of the best cd releases ever! This cd has not left the rotation in my cd player since I got it, and it never will. From start to finish, completely flawless. Cheers to FFD!!!"
2,Too small for my wife,The product was a little smaller than we expected. I measured it and it was 7 inches but just too small for my wife's wrist.She's average hight and weight but we had to return this for a larger size.
3,"cheaply made. Works, but breaks easily.","I think I said it all in the title. This works, and it's great in that if the power goes out, you don't have to worry about batteries. You just whip this thing out, wind it up and bam, you have light. You do have to wind it for a while to get any prolonged light out of it though. And the crank is flimsy and cheap. The first time I used it, I feared that it might break, and not long thereafter, my fear was proven to be a reality. So now it sits, useless and broken. I guess it's fine though, as long as you're gentle."
1,Junk,"I bought two of these for my son and husband for Christmas. Neither of them work anymore. The handles are what you have to use to make them work. They are not very sturdy and snap off. The flashlight is then useless. It is a great idea and I wish they had been better made. While they worked, they were great."
3,mmmm,"yea um, i thot this was pretty awesum, like totally cool dude!yea um, definately buy it, go barbie!ryan hudge"
5,A Classic,"This is the only version of remakes that I will watch. Alastair Sim was the perfect person for this role. Each character is believable and even though you know what happens year after year, you can't help but love Scrooge at the end."
5,A Christmas Classic,"I traditionally watch this on Christmas Eve, while wrapping presents (not all Santa's helpers live at the North Pole). I was very happy with my former DVD, but this version does not disappoint at all! Highly recommended!"
4,Vintage versions of A Christmas Carol,Was very disappointed that older versions of A Christmas Carol were not shown on TV during Christmas season. Order this as a post Christmas gift for my family since we love the older versions of this movie.
1,Disappointing,This is a very disappointing CD. The only reason to buy it is because it is the only recording of (some of) this opera. The Ostendorf productions cannot be recommended. I hope that a superior recording will be released soon.
5,Thoroughly engrossing British mystery.,"This mystery will please fans of Elizabeth George. The main characters are fleshed out and interest you from the beginning. The plot is very absorbing and the setting in Wales only intensifies the air of ""mystery"" about it. I enjoyed this mystery immensely and look forward to reading more of Ms. Taylor's books and continuing to get to know DCI McKenna."
4,Good start to a Wales based mystery series.,"Three policemen try to unravel first the identity and then the reason for the murder of a woman found hanged near 'Gallows Cottage'.The men have an uneasy and at times bickering association. There is much of interest in the locale and characters involved. I found the book to be enjoyable and am anxious to read Mrs. Taylor's next installment. She is a good writer with strong beliefs who expresses all the petty and serious discontents faced by ""Everyman"".The mystery is inhabited by familiar ghosts. Mrs. Taylor observes of one character, who has left his wife and alienated most others around him that, ""...he waited for Death, the only visitor likely to call."" A thoughtful mystery with more than murder on its mind."
4,Very busy first book,"Alison Taylor's first book has been critically acclaimed, and since this publication, has written four others based around the main Police characters. As far as detective novels go, the plot is well-planned, and keeps you guessing almost to the end as to ""whodunnit"" and who will receive their just desserts. An insight into Welsh policing and society - particularly the desire to maintain their indigenous language is educational. However, I got the feeling that the author was trying to display as much of her writing talent as possible; using masses of words and long, linked sentences where some stern editing would have benefited. Still, I have enjoyed her other books and will happily read more."
5,Great accessory,This is a fanastic speaker system. The quality sound is great. I couldn't ask for a better portable stereo. It plays the high and low notes clear.
2,Poor sound,"I don't understand why people's reviews of this dock are so positive. I bought this because of the high ratings and because it was cheaper than the Bose system my boyfriend wanted me to get. But when I got it home I discovered the sound quality was awful, tinny and weak. We returned it immediately and bought the Bose, and the difference was outstanding! It's possible we had a defective machine, otherwise I can't believe people would rate this thing so highly. But if I were you, I'd check out the Bose Sound Dock first. Not only does it have exceptionally great sound, but it's sleeker and lighter and all around designed better."
4,Great Price for a great sound,"I chose this product after reading many different reviews online. Needless to say that I was not disappointed in the sound quality or the volume. The thing projected so well we used it for our wedding reception instead of renting sound gear, and it work much better than expected. Loud enough when time dictated, and soft with enough power. Plus, you're probably not going to find a better price then on here. There are slots of D batteries, but I haven't used that function yet."
4,portable audio system,I really don't know much about it. I purchased it for my son. He is pleased with it.
1,Altec Lansing im7 gets a thumbs up,"I was amazed at the big sound that came out of these small speakers. It was a bit more than I wanted to spend, but I feel like it was well worth the money. Amazon had it shipped and at my house in two days, too. Nice."
1,"stay away, stay far away!!","this thing sucks!!everytime I use it, I want to throw it out of my window!!"
5,Good choice,"After much research, we purchased this over the Bose system. We've had it for about 4 months now, and have been very pleased with the purchase. The system has a nice modern look and sounds fantastic! It's a bit heavy for regular moving, but for occasional replacement, the handle works well. The mini converter also works well. The sound has been very impressive, even at high levels. I'm very happy with this system and would recommend it with enthusiasm."
5,So good I bought it twice,I can set this system up in one corner of my (admittedly modest) ranch house and crank it til it fills the whole house -- with no distortion! I originally bought an inexpensive refurbished unit online and began to get static bursts after about the tenth use. I returned that one and had no hesitation about shelling out twice as much money for a brand-new one.
2,Good Sound: But Freezes at High Volume,"This unit produced great sound with my 30GB IPOD, but after about 20-30 minutes at higher volumes, it would freeze the IPOD. I then had to shut down the IPOD to unfreeze it, then turn it back on, which is a real pain. Apparently, from reading other reviews of the IM7, Altec is aware of the problem but has no plans to correct it. I'm sending it back and hoping something better is out there."
3,"Great sound, poor design","I like the sound a lot, better than Bose. I had to return mine, however, because the slot where the I-Pod goes in would not stay closed. Strangely, when I went to return it, the demo in the store did the same thing. I asked the salesman why it wouldn't shut and he said ""after a while, they just won't shut."" He did say it offered the best sound of any other I-Pod speaker he had. Seems strange that Altec-Lansing wouldn't have come up with a better design. Also, the battery in the remote is ridiculously hard to install -terrible design there. And, a carrying case would be nice.So, great sound, but use caution if you travel with it, like I do."
2,Faulty docking door,"Ive had my iM7 for several months now, and i would easily give it 5 stars if it werent for the design of the docking door. I felt right away that it would be an issue,and sure enough, within 2 months of very light use the door wont stay shut. Fortunately the unit still plays with the door open, but watching any video is awkward. Hopefully Altec Lansing is adressing this issue."
2,RETURNING IT TOMORROW,"SOUNDS AND LOOKS GREAT, BUT AFTER A FEW HOURS OF USE IT STOPPED WORKING. WOULD CHARGE iPOD, BUT WOULD NOT PLAY MEDIA. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, BUT I WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE."
1,WARNING: Adapter DOES NOT WORK on 2nd gen nanos!!!!,"I just set up my IM7 and when I tried to actually put my 2nd gen nano in the dock with the adapter I found that it DOES NOT FIT!Apparently this is a known problem, as they will send you a proper adapter that actually works, if you complain and pay $3 for shipping, or so I read on an online review of the IM7.A small amount, but it's their screw-up, I shouldn't have to pay anything. You would think out of courtesy they would send it to you for free, esp. since this is a known problem they just haven't bothered to fix because they apparently don't care about their customers enough to fix it, they're happy to keep charging $3 extra and making people wait before they can actually use their machine they paid for.ARG!!!So I'm going to have to wait for a functioning adapter to arrive in the mail, however long that takes.ALTEC: FIX THE PROBLEM ALREADY! PUT ADAPTERS THAT WORK _IN THE BOX_! AND IN THE MEANTIME, PAY MY SHIPPING!!!"
1,I love it and recommend it ot anyone,"The sound quality is excellent! Much better sound quality than the BOSE. You can take it anywhere and it fits perfectly in my office shelf. Another beauty about it that it charges your iPod if it is plugged with an AC cord. The only problem is that it is a little heavy but other than that, I am enjoying it very much."
1,Still waiting,This product still hasn't arrived - 6 weeks after it was ordered!!When it does I will share my view.
2,Causing my ipod to freeze,"Got these speakers for X-mas. After the first 2 songs my ipod completely froze up on these speakers, I had to let the battery die, and recharge to get it back to life. Resetting didn't work. The next day used the speakers all day, it happened again! Then I tried my ipod mini on it to see if it would make a difference - my ipod mini then froze. I'm very disappointed. The speakers are great as far as sound and design. Maybe it's just a fluke, I'm going to exchange the speakers tomorrow and try a new set."
4,OK if power is more important than portability,"If your primary objective is to get big sound out of your little ipod, this will probably put a smile on your face. When the ipod door on my im7 broke (wouldn't close) after only three weeks, and Costco said the line had been discontinued, I traded in for a Logitech mm50, less than $100 at Costco. A lot less power and bass than the IM7, but for me the Logitech is the better overall value. The sound is amazing, it's a much smaller and more portable device, and it has a rechargeable, internal battery."
5,Earns its *5* Stars,"This is a very nice system. Exceptional sound (the bass is good for a portable system like this), nice size (it's portable) and it works with my Nano! I bought this not knowing if the Nano would fit the ""holder compartment"" and I'm happy to say it does and it sounds great! And while the Nano works, it doesn't fit flush/snug like the regular iPod or the Mini with the included adapter (can you say accessory opportunity, Altec?). I recommend this whole-heartedly and without reservation (costs less than the Bose, its portable and it sounds better!). I read recently that this particular system (iM7) received a Consumer RPorts ""Best Buy"" for an iPod/MP3 speaker system - I couldn't agree more! I can't wait to use it for backyard BBQs come Summer 06!"
5,Sounds Great!,"I am definitely satisfied with the iM7, I had a difficult time finding it in the stores. At the time I had a 2nd generation Nano and the iM7 did not have a ""cover adaptor"" included. However, they will send you one free and you can still use the iM7 without it. I have since moved up to the 30g IPOD. I researched and listened to various audio systems including BOSE and I found the iM7 sound(as many reviewers did)better quality. Also, the system uses batteries which adds to its portability. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. When friends hear the sound they can't believe the price!"
1,"Two Bought, Two Broke","I purchased two of these units, and both completely failed (no power on). Altec Lansing customer support is non-existent. $500 down the drain. Please consider a more reliable item, and one with customer service."
5,Great portable player!,"I bought the IM7 for a vacation cruise, and I couldn't have been happier with it. I wanted something easily portable, but without giving up sound quality; the IM7 was just what I needed. Whether I was in my cabin, on the sundeck of the ship, or laying on a beach, I had all of my tunes with me, and they sounded great! Awesome bass! The remote came in very handy when I was just laying around and I wanted to adjust the volume, bass/treble, or skip/repeat a track without getting up.Just make sure your ipod is fully charged before you use the IM7 on batteries. I was on a beach and the ipod battery died, although the iM7 still had power. It wont charge your ipod when its on the battery feature.I recommend that if you'll be using this as a portable player,that you check out the shoulder strap carrying case too. It's a great way to add protection and convenience while you carry it from place to place."
2,Another faulty door latch,"When I bought this as a gift for my wife about a year ago, I thought the door latch felt iffy. Sure enough, a few days ago it stopped latching, keeping the door open all the time. Bad design for sure.Great sound with the unit, though. Fills a room nicely. The open door doesn't affect playing or charging; just irritating and doesn't look nearly as nice when using it for a dinner party.I'll check the warranty, but I think it's past. I might try removing the springs that force the door open."
4,IPOD Boom Box,"A lot of reviews were correct about weight, lack of bass/treb controls on unit, etc... but bottom line is this unit has a great sound with good bass reproduction and is portable with shoulder strap & handle. I did have to request a 2nd gen nano adapter which I am waiting for because it does not come with the unit."
1,Non-existent customer service,"This product shipped without a power cable. We contacted Altec's customer support and they apologized and said they would send out a power cable. Two weeks went by and no cable. Another call and another sincere apology with the promise of a power cable. A month later and still no cable. The unit has good sound, but eats batteries like crazy. So if you buy this item, just hope you don't have to contact Altec's customer ""service"" group because as far as I can tell, it doesn't exist."
4,Pretty good,"I read the other reviews and thought this product must be amazing but it is only really good. It has good sound and great electrical connections. It has power plugs for almost every country. It also has a good interface with the iPOD. The drawback I had was that it did not have an adapter for the iPOD Nano gen2. You have to send away for it.The shipping and ordering were first rate. I recommend this product to others but if you have a gen2 nano, you will have to go through the hassle of ordering the adaptor."
1,Not for latest iPods,"This particular dog will no longer send video to your TV from the latest generation iPod Classics. Even when you connect everything, and set the iPod, it still asks for the connector. You are stuck.Avoid this like the plague."
1,Didn't work properly,I wouldn't buy this product. The tool to make it able to properly secure your ipod didn't work. We tried two different Nano's and it wouldn't allow them to click in properly. The return to the company who shipped it hasn't been easy either.
3,"Great sound, 2 ugly issues","The sound is great on this thing. I hear aspects of the music I have not heard on my desktop system nor in my car. BUT, the door quickly picked up an issue whereby you have to jiggle the ipod around to get sound in both speakers. AND apparently there is some incompatibility between this model and some iPods, because mine will freeze fairly frequently when I use the unit (it's never done that before), and I am not the only one."
2,Faulty Door Latch,"Although I love the look and the sound blew me away, I am very disappointed the sturdyness of the iM7. After a few months the latch stopped working. They discontinued making them so I have to chose between them replacing with an iM9, which I hear doesn't have the same sound quality or an M602, which isn't portable like this one. I wish I read these reviews before making my selection. If anyone knows how I can fix the latch myself..I'd be grateful."
1,buyer beware!,"Very good sound but it constantly and consistantly freezes my iPod to the point that it has to be sent back to Apple for repair/replacement. In fact I have 2 iM7s and they both do it, to any iPod. I dont use either anymore except every once in awhile when i am working in the basement or the garage, and within minutes - same thing: iPod freeze."
4,"A ""must have"" system...","The Altec Lansing iM7 is the ""Lexus"" of the MP3 audio systems. It's the one that forced Bose to go back to the drafting screen. Three years ago I gave the first ""line dance"" on one of the beaches in Aruba: The subwoofer made folks do a double take.This device is a bit unweldy - the integrated handle barely gets the job done. With the 8 ""D"" size batteries it gets a little heavy, but its sound more than makes up for those inconveniences. It will ""light up"" any room! Buy!Buy!Buy!"
2,"awesome for the first 6 months, then quickly downhill","My sister bought this unit and I was blown away by the sound quality. I put it on my wish list and received it for christmas. For the first 6 months it worked great. Then my cats chewed my remote and it didn't work so I had to start using the buttons on the top of the unit. They lost sensitivity to the point where they barely worked after about 2 or 3 months. In the next month or two, the Ipod cradle got some type of short in it and only plays in one speaker unless you hold it half-way closed. Had to resort to connecting my Ipod via an external audio cable for full stereo sound, which means that it no longer gets charged while in use. If this thing cost $50 it might be worth it but since it is much more than that, my advice would be to skip it. My sister's has the same problems and mine even seemed to develop faster than hers, suggesting that the inferior quality is getting worse as production continues. Way overpriced for the quality."
3,My iPod keeps freezing-up,"I've been using the iM7 outside by the pool. The sound quality is spectacular! Unfortunately, after an hour or so, my 20G iPod always freezes-up. The only way to unfreeze it is to unplug it, let the battery drain & then recharge. I initially thought this was an iPod issue. Since the iPod was still under warranty, I took it to the local Apple Store's Genius Bar. The friendly neighborhood genius said it sounded like a faulty hard-drive & replaced the iPod with a like unit gratus.Took my new iPod home, loaded it up with music & next day - same problem. Trekked back down to the Apple Store again & got another replacement. When the third one froze after just a few songs - I came to the conclusion that the problem must be with the iM7.My solution: I only connect my iPod to the iM7 via the Aux-In mini-port on the back of the unit. Now I get the same great sound for hours on end without the freeze."
2,Awesome sound but freezes iPod,"Purchased the system and it froze my iPod on several occassions. Most recently, a friend's iPod was also frozen/stuck when the audio system was used. The last time I used the system, it froze the iPod every hour. We played at moderate levels, so volume should not have been a factor.This is my only complaint/problem with the product. Contacted customer service to determine exchange or return.Otherwise, easy to use, excellent sound with good bass, remote is helpful. Compared to other portable iPod speaker systems, this one had the best price for the features. The sound is really superior for a system of this size and price range."
5,Altec Lansing iM-7,Excellent product with convenient features. Works well as a portable box with the carrying case.
5,Well worth the extra $.,"I could not be happier! Yes, it cost a little more but SOUNDS GREAT! I have this system at work (desk job) and the remote comes in really handy to shut off when others enter my office and then turn it right back on when they leave. The only concern is the docking system and opening/closing it. So far, I have had no problems but based on other reviews, I understand that they break easily so am trying to be careful with it."
3,Great Sound But.....,"I love the sound, and think that it is superior to Bose & Apple machines, but I too have had problems with it freezing my ipod. You basically then have to shut things down and let the ipod restore itself. If you have to use batteries, it eats them fast to produce this quality sound. Finally, there are some problems adjusting the mechanism size that holds the ipod, but the iM7 can also be used with the AUX plug in the back."
2,"Good Sound, but it broke after 6 months","I got this Altec Lansing iM7 for Christmas, and was very happy with the sound quality. Unfortunately, in June (just 6 months after I took it out of the box) some circuit inside broke through normal usage and it suddenly sounded all scratchy, unlistenable. I couldn't find the warranty info, and since I got it as a gift I have no receipt, so there's nothing I can do to get it fixed. Be warned, keep the warranty papers and receipt."
4,Great sound!,Really really nice sound for such a small size speaker system - the iPod dock is just a little too hard to open and use.
2,"good sound, bad wiring","This had great sound, but one speaker stopped working after I used it (gently) six times. It can't be easily repaired except by the manufacturer, and now it's more than a year old, but useless for music."
2,"Great Sound & Features, Bad Door Design","I love the sound and the remote features and all of the ports on the back. However, after using it for several months, the DOOR will not close anymore. I have to use packing tape to keep it 'closed' and I have to use the cord that connects the iPod to the input jack on the back. Therefore, the iPod does not charge and constantly is using its own batteries. It is too bad that this system has a bad door design, otherwise, I would have given it five stars +!"
3,konked out before the 2 year mark,"I was really pleased with this from the word go. Sound quality and volume were great for the size and the price. Battery run is also a huge plus and I even used the line in to play CD's pretty frequently.BUT....it recently started acting unresponsive. The ipod seems to get a charge and is connected but the sound just isnt there. Its spotty. I've unplugged it for a day or two, came back tried it fresh and it would work again great until I turned it off again. Next day just won't work. I'm looking for a replacement right now.All in all. It was great and I guess the timeframe is about what you expect these days from a product at this price point, but thats my real beef. i don't want to buy another of the same product knowing it will fizzle in 2 years time."
3,"Sounds great, but kills batteries","I bought this player to give me an audio option for a classic car. It can only run on the batteries while in the car, and this was given very little thought by the maker. If you leave the batteries in the player, they will completely drain in a matter of 2-3 hours even with player COMPLETELY powered down. To preserve the batteries, I have to dislodge one D-sized battery in each battery bay (2 bays with 4 D-cell batteries each) to interrupt the circuit and prevent draining. Then, I have to put the batteries back in when I'm ready to use it again. VERY inconvenient, but my use is somewhat unconventional. Sounds great, though."
5,I feel bad,"In an earlier review I trashed the IM3C. While I still stand by that review, I definately owe Altec a rave review for their IM7 (I returned the former for the latter). The IM7 is exactly what I was looking for. The sound is rich and vibrant. It is way loud, and its highs and lows are better than the Bose. If you are looking for a portable device to play your iPod, my guess is that this is exactly what the doctor ordered.Altec Lansing inMotion IM3C Portable Audio System for iPod and iPod Photo"
3,can't get it to work on batteries,"As beautiful as this product is, and not so hard to carry about, I cannot get it to work with batteries. It freezes my 30 g video ipod. Any suggestions are welcome. So far I like the player, but portability is what I bought it for over the Bose or Klipsch."
5,The Best !!!!!,"I was surfing the internet for a good present. So I saw this speaker for ipods and I check the price and all the reviews that it had, and I said, that's it I found it.. Great speaker system, great bass levels, super portable, and nice features as control remote, the design is beautiful, and the price even better I love it, and my wife love it too"
1,Cheap plastic - not worth the money,Bought this a year ago and it has already broken down. The place where you insert the ipod is made of cheap plastic and the door is very flimsy. The door broke with 1 year and the item was unusable. From a company like this I would have expected better. A complete waste of money and I would suggest that you do not waste your money on this like I did.
1,Poor Warranty,"A very good sounding unit, but discontinued so you cannot get warranty service. On mine, the door broke(as is common). I sent it in, but Altec says it is discontinued, so I can choose another like the im9 or m602? They are not in the same class(or price) in my experience. I will try to get my money back, it is simply unacceptable service. So if you buy one of these now, hope it doesn't break because you won't get another one."
5,iPod Boom Box,"The iM7 is superior in every way. It has excellent fidelity, the remote is great, and it had been a fantastic add-on for my iPod. I think that it represents the best value I have found for this class of device."
2,good sound bad functions...,when i first put my iPod in it...it sounded amazing! i mean it was up there with the boss sound dock. but after about 5 or 6 songs i went to change the song and my iPod froze. At first i thought it was the iPod but then i put my buddies brand new iPod(i mean less than a week old)in the boom box and listened to about 20 songs or so then it just froze up without even touching the iPod. the iPods eventually went back to normal i just had to wait for the battery in the iPod to die then i could use it normaly again. Maybe i just got a defective boom box but this thing has givein me alot of problems. going off sound and clearity of the music i would say 5 star all the way but it has givein me alot of problems with freezeing up my iPod.
2,Freezes-up,"Best sound of all of the sound docks and its ruggard, low profile is great for the outdoors, even the beach, but the iM7 has a huge flaw. The unit continually freezes-up when played above medium volume. This can be a real drag when you are counting on it to provide non-stop music at a social gathering. I have friends with the same unit and we all experience this significant problem."
1,Broken After 2 Years!,"Maybe we got a lemon? A little after a year the unit started having connection problems with our iPod and the sound would cut in and out. If you wiggled the iPod you could get it to work properly. Now after 2 years the power amp has gone out. You can hear music coming faintly through the speakers so I know the connection is working. Also the power LED has gone out in conjunction with this so something tells me this thing is not getting powered properly to drive the speakers.If working right the unit sounds good, but since it doesn't work there is no use in giving it any type of accolades for sound."
5,No regrets whatsoever,All reviews had this unit rated highly and they are correct. The sound quality is superb and you can ramp up quite nicely outside on the deck during parties and barbecues (as I do). My Ipod crashes frequently during excessively loud playback. That is the only negative to using the iM7 for this purpose.
5,Amazing Customer Service,"Wow.I am seriously impressed. I live in Mexico and was intending to buy some speakers for my ipod. After researching the available models I decided on the iM7.I knew the price in the U.S., and was disappointed when I saw that the price locally was over twice as much. I would just have to wait for my next trip to the States.Well, I decided to check whether Amazon could ship it to me. It could! and the price seems reasonable! Including the shipping and import duties!I made my order and saw delivery would be in 2 days. I was very skeptical. In fact, delivery was the following day. Next day delivery on an international shipment. WOW.One problem. Despite having paid an ""Import Duties Deposit"" to cover taxes and duties, DHL charged me aproximately the same amount upon delivery.After contacting Amazon, they promptly refunded the ""Import Duties Deposit""Very professional, quick, service.Oh, and the speakers? Everything they are supposed to be. Wonderful sound. Great value."
5,Happy with this product,The sound quality has been very good and it is powerful enough to rock the whole house. I don't think the boose is worth the extra money. I have been very happy with this product.You have to be careful when closing the door and some reviewers have had problems with that.
4,Great Performance at a Reasonable Price!,"I bought this item after hearing it at a relative's cookout. It has rich sound, as good as systems costing much more. In addition to my iPod, I also use it to replace my computers cheap speakers. I recommend this speaker system highly; you won't be disappointed."
4,Great Little Music Maker,"I saw a seminar leader use one of these for ""mood"" music and fell in love with the quality. And the kewl look! I'd given it 5 stars, but the instructions that come with it are minimum and need more information in them. Other than that, it sounds great, even played real loud... or soft. You can put out for a special carrying bag for it - but I just found a round type bag at a thrift store that works just as well, for a fraction of the price. (It was for a tripod or maybe one of those camping chairs, I think.)It's not too big to move around the house with me, or outside. Wouldn't take it on a plane trip though. Too cumbersome. But there are plenty of smaller speakers made exactly for that kind of travel already."
5,Worth every penny!,"This system is amazing. If you are a child of the 80's, you will no doubt remember someone walking down the street listening to a boom box held on their shoulder.Fast forward to '07....if someone were to try that with this, his head would jettison and become a missle, shooting sideways right off his shoulders!The sound on this thing is wicked awesome. The remote works well and stores neatly in the back of the unit.My firends and I compared this to the Bose, plus several Logitech offerings. The iM7 takes first place for overall value, superior sound, and portability.Spend the dough for this unit...it is soooo worth it.Go Sox!"
4,Great sounding system except for one defect,"1st unit I received had a defective ""+"" up volume button on the main unit. Only worked when pressed hard or sometimes didn't work at all. The remote worked good. Luckly since Amazon has a hassle free replacement procedure, I received the replacement in a couple days after reporting the defect. The replacement unit has been working perfectly."
1,Poorly Made Product,"Pros: Great sound quality, includes remote for adjustments from afar, comes with outlet adaptors for use in foreign places.Cons: Will scratch up your ipod, eats batteries like it was made in 1972, door stops closing after a few months of light use, and Altec Lansing has terrible customer support!My advice: If you must, buy it at amazon (thier price is $150 less than the Altec Lansing website) and save your receipt because you'll need it when your iM7 malfunctions in a few months! Don't forget to coat your ipod in some type of skin to keep the iM7 from scratching it (badly)."
5,I LOVE THIS THING!!!!!!!!,"I have had my unit going on three years and it still ROCKS!!!!!!! I use it outside when doing yard work or cooking on the grill. Sounds fantastic, can get really loud and keeps my i-pod charged. What more could one want. If it broke i would buy it again. I also bought the harness to help protect it. I like how i can sling it over my shoulder and the small attached pouch comes in handy to carry the a/c adapter etc. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,Great While it Lasts,"I purchased my iM7 two years ago and it was great until yesterday. Now it no longer comes on or plays (no, it was dropped, spilled on, or otherwise abused). Tech support told me it sounded like and short and there was nothing they could do for me. Likewise, a manager told me there was nothing to be done as the unit is out of warranty.So, I paid $250 for two years of use. Not a good value in my book. I won't be buying another Altec Lansing product."
4,Good Box,"nice and clear and loud! it would be nice to have controls on the box and not just on the remote, plus the remote as to be within about 8 ft to work. Still seems to be the best on the market for a loud box."
5,Profound Evocation of Tragedy in a Pastoral Setting,"Johannes Somary directs the Amorartis Orchestra, a period-instrument orchestra, in a recording of the masque/opera ""Acis & Galatea"", HWV 49, by George Frederic Handel (1685-1759).""Acis and Galatea, composed in spring 1718, was modelled on the English masques by Pepusch and others produced at Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1715-18 as a modest (and moderately successful) counterblast to the Italian opera; but it comprehensively transcends them with its profound evocation of tragedy in a pastoral setting, leavened by touches of grotesque humour in the characterization of the giant Polyphemus."" (Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians)The vocal soloists on this recording:Galatea, Julianne Baird, sopranoAcis, Grayson Hirst, tenorAlto, Jeffrey Dooley, countertenorPolyphemus, John Ostendorf, bassDamon, Stephen Oosting, tenor"
1,A truly miserable book,"The first impression I had when I received this book from Amazon was that it had been bound by 5-year old child. The pages are poor quality paper from a photocopier that have been glued (lots of glue) to a thick cloth cover which accounts for about half of the book's thickness. As for content, any meaningful information (equations and figures) has been copied, in some cases photocopied from other books. There is no depth whatsoever to this book. I expected something approaching the level of Samuel Glasstone's ""The Effects of Nuclear Weapons"" and was extremely dissappointed."
1,deeply disturbing,"I was truly stunned when I was given a copy of this book. My initial impression was the previous owner had dropped it in the toilet or spilt an entire pot of coffee over it and left it soaking overnight. It was in fact hand bound, presumably by the author - possibly as part of a class project, and consequently the book flops open wherever you put it. It is impossible to keep it closed. The text is devoid of any useful information and merely contains copies of equations with no explanation of their origin. The various typefaces used throughout the 50 pages or so suggest they were probably lifted from other texts. I would find it hard to recommend to anyone unless they had a passing interest in bookbinding"
4,Excellent work!,"Not only did this book make me want to go to Egypt more, it made me so glad to see that there is someone who can make more sense of Egypt's ancient mysteries than most Egyptologists, who claim to have all the right information regarding it's origins. There is alot we don't know, but this book definatley provides vast and detailed insight, which to me shows that this wonderous civilization was definately not primative! Well done John."
5,"this is fun, but Schwaller and West are nuts","Schwaller de Lubicz was a genius, but a creative genius, not a scientific one.I don't dispute that there was an advanced civilization millenia before Egypt. The case for that is all circumstantial, but it is an overwhelming circumstantial case, and if historians ever get a clue the existence of so-called ""Atlantis"" will be taken for granted.Nor do I dispute the basic truth of Schwaller's esoteric worldview.What I dispute is the idea that the temple at Luxor has anything to do with what Schwaller says it does. The miracle of Egypt is that it is basically a blank slate. It can be interpreted any way one likes. The interpretations tell us much about the interpreter, but none of us will ever really understand Egypt."
3,Serpent in the Sky book,"This was a good book, but it is hard to keep up withthe math in it. I understood the most of it, but I feltlike it was over my head in some parts of it. But read itfor yourself and maybe you will understand it better than I."
4,Making Schwaller de Lubicz understandable,"If you prescibe to conventional views about Egyptology don't buy this book. However, if you believe that science does not have the story of our origins and Egypt quite right, then this book will open your eyes.The writing style is accessible, not too technical, and not too etheric. The work of Schwaller de Lubicz is presented, along with JAWs owns metaphors, in a way to help you understand that Egyptian culture and architecture was much deeper than archeologists think.JAW is most famous pointing to geologic weathering analysis of the Sphinx show that it is at least 10,000 years old. The book stays rooted in science enough to keep the discerning reader interested. There is also a hint of the civilization that pre-dates Egypt (?Atlantis) which will also keep the alternate reader interested. All-in-all a very good and balanced book.Also recommended is 'Temple of the Cosmos' by Jeremy Naydler."
4,The Intriguing Study of Symbolic Egyptology,"Symbolic Egyptology, the school of Egyptological thought derived from the ideas of visionary philosopher/scientist/mystics R.A. Schwaller De Lubicz and G.I. Gurdjieff, is an untapped reservoir of metaphysical information. This book is a fabulous introduction to the subject, yet it falls into the unfortunate trap of the author's regressive sociopolitical vision and new-age beliefs. Aside from this, however, the presentation is stunning, and I'd argue that this book is a must-read for anyone with an interest in Egyptian Archaeology, Hermeticism, or any of the ancient spiritual disciplines that originated in ancient Xem."
5,Great playing plus a cover of Kashmir - how can you go wrong?,I'm a fan of Cello music and this is VERY well played and a really wide variety of stuff which is a good thing. I've got nothing against the standard catalog of music but it's good to get outside the box.PLUS it's got a rockin' all cello cover of Led Zepplin's Kashmir - so how can you go wrong?
5,This is the real deal.,"To be up-front, i know not only the producers of this CD, but also the shamans in the village that have recorded these icaros. So, in that sense, this is a biased review. With that said, for me, these icaros are the real deal. You won't find these icaros to be ""easy listening"" or necessarily ""pretty"" at first listen. Yet, after you encounter them a few times (especially in a ceremonial context), they will find a place in your heart. These Shipibo people will use icaros to heal or transform circumstances in virtually any situation. For them, sound is an elemental way to alter the very fabric of the universe. This CD can be a doorway into that world for the uninitiated.On top of all that, when you buy a copy, part of the proceeds of the sale go directly to benefit these Shipibo people. Having been to their home myself, i know that every little bit helps them to keep these traditions intact and flourishing."
2,Taken out of context,"The icaros on this disc, if that's what in fact they are, are being sung for the purpose of recording. They were not recorded in ceremony. There is no leaf-bundle rattling. The background noise (of which there is little) is of children playing or sounds of common daily activities. Very disappointed."
5,Hitachi,"I checked other systems and frankly this one was the clearest picture of all. Expansions capabilities are also quite diversed. One negative side is that the input ports are low (close to the floor) thus needing longer cables than otherwise needed. Asides from that, overall a 5 star."
1,There are better options,"This is a boring and plain bad movie.Don't be fouled just because it is a Japanese horror movie. It is bad, there nothing to be scare of. This is not a thriller, not a psychological horror film, is really just a bad an very boring movie.Don't waste any money on this movie. If you are looking for good horror Asian films try ""A Tale of two sisters"", ""The eye"", and ""The eye 2""."
1,sucked,"I hope they didn't offer the book free as a marketing ploy to gain buzz and word-of-mouth. If they did : FAIL. It was so choppy and hard to get through. I removed it from Kindle after only a few ""chapters"". Clunky read and a waste of my time."
4,Amazing CD to be a Christimas album,"I just got this CD, and let me tell you it's amazing! Tarja's voice is very good, and I simply love her.First, this is a **Christmas album**, so you can't say that this is the new direction of what Tarja will do as a solo artist, in fact, she said she won't do a christmas album again. So I'm telling you that you can't judge her new music by this album, I advice you to get he First STUDIO album that is going to be release this November, which promises being very amazing!Plus, don't expect she will do the same type of music when she was with Nightwish, for that, buy their new album, Dark Passion Play, which is good also."
2,This Isn't Nightwish,"If you were expecting Nightwish lite, forget about it . I was expecting something that tilted toward Charlotte Church or Tarja's duet with Martin Kesici, which is where this disc goes . But, this CD is, in many ways a dis-jointed effort . The piano based pop tracks all sound nice enough, but they really don't show off Tarja's abilities . The classical pieces suffer from a pianist who is obviously uncomfortable with the material . The Polka sounds completly out of place and the songs that feature a guitarist don't work that well . Now that I have have gotten that out there, the good news . Tarja's ability to go from soft pop to intricate classical material is rare . The fact that this CD is a product of someone who spent the past 9 years in a Goth band gives you some idea of the talent she has . Also , the jewel case is an expensive and unusual piece ."
1,"GREAT matrial, VERY BAD voice","The matrial for this album is GREAT. But the voice is VERY BAD. Beautiful classical pieces like ""Ave Maria"" sounds horrible:( For me is she amateur. Pop singer Celine Dion sings classical pieces of she where a classical trained opera singer:)"
3,Good supplement,"We found Fodor's Exploring Egypt to be full of pretty pictures and good history, but a bit short on practical information. Specifically, the information on various sites and events was incomplete (hours would be omitted, no helpful hints provided, etc.)The Lonely Planet Guide is a much better resource. It really contained everything we needed to know during our week there, and we'd recommend that guide over this one if you only get one. Exploring Egypt does have many more pictures, however, and can help you get a feel for what you want to see, so we recommend it as a second resource."
4,Great Tent,"We have an older version of this tent with a gray rain fly instead of the red one. We've used the tent for three seasons now and overall have been very happy with it. It's great in storms and has never leaked. It's plenty big enough, with a living room you can use if it rains. It does take a while to set up, but once you've done it a couple of times it's not too bad. My primary beef is that the poles can bend and break if you are trying to set it up by yourself (hint: be sure to clip in the poles before raising the tent) and it's hard to find replacement poles, but I did find a set at Campmor; Coleman was no help at all. Overall a great car camping tent. I'll buy another if they change the color of the rain fly back to gray. :-)"
4,Good tent,"It's a little heavy and cinfunsing directions, but Im satisfied with the tent, it has a lot of room (8 person)"
4,Great tent for a family outing,"Took this tent out this past weekend w/my 5yr son. He and I set it up in about 45 min. It took awhile to setup and get all the stakes in the ground (it was rocky). The tent is well designed and constructed but I do think it is a little complex to set up. Fortunately my son was able to hold the one end of the poles while I did the bending. I'm curious as to what the tent will be like after several uses. The poles seem to be bent to just about their max.Regardless, this tent is a good buy for the money."
1,!!!!!!!!,I cant believe it. I thought that this was a great tent but the fabric is very thin and very cheap material. I have set it up twice in my basement because I am afraid that if I use it outside it will get a hole in it. I was going to try camping out in my backyard tonight and I found out that the strechy rope that held the pole together had snapped. I am going to try to a get replacement poles or get my money back. Only buy this if it is for your son or daughters sleepover on the back porch not durable for actual camping!!!
2,Got soaked in driving rainstorm,"This is a great tent for rain-free weather. Unfortunately, the first night we used it a thunderstorm with high wind and lots of rain came up. The wind blew the rain under the fly and we got soaked. (The fly BARELY covers the ceiling/roof areas in the 2 low-height portions.) The next day we returned the tent to the store where we purchased it and bought one with a more adequate rain fly. We did love the 3 rooms. Thought the tent went up quickly and easlity for such a large tent."
4,Aliens?,"Excepting a couple of proof-reader's errors, this book has a lot going for it, especially for Deep Space 9 fans. The author articulately provides the reader with a history for Garak as well as some history for Cardassians in general, all of which he weaves into an interesting story. The biggest disappointment is that the Cardassians, except for phenotype, don't seem alien, and are no different from paranoid humans living under a military government."
4,The only good Cardassan...,"This story is apparently an ""autobiography"" of DS9 tailor/ spy Garak compiled of journal entries of his ruminations on the upcoming reinvasion of his home planet, interspersed with memories of his military school experiences. Cardassian academies, I'll have you know, are a lot tougher than West Point or The Citadel, as you'll discover in this story. Their ""lords of discipline"" are what turn out hard cases like Dukat and Damar. And it's also why Garak, despite his seeming effeteness, is a pretty tough customer himself at times. I don't know if Robinson, who played Garak on the series, really is the author, or if he did a Bill Shatner and had it ghosted. All I know is if you can get past the temptation to be a purist, this book is worth the read. No matter who ""wrote"" it."
4,An above-average book by someone who shouldn't be this good,"When I heard that Andrew J. Robinson was writing the ""memoirs"" of his marvelous DS9 character, I figured it was another SF vanity project like the TekWar books or the like. Surprisingly, Robinson not only understands Elim Garak but also fleshes out Cardassia a lot more than any writer at DS9 did. He creates a world that is both believable and alien.There are flaws, such as the reason Garak was exiled to DS( and the amount of guilt that Garak feels for Cardassian misdeeds in the past, but this is a very good read and better than most of the Trek books I've read. Carey, Gray, and most of the rest have nothing on this ""amateur""."
4,A Stitch in Time is a good read,"How many Star Trek actors could write such a credible story about their characters? This is an amazing piece of work - it weaves together many things you might know from the show with all the back story that made Garak credible. And it is funny too. If you ever thought the writers were the only ones making up those characters, read this book. It's better than 95% of the Star Trek books out there."
5,Andrew Robinson is the voice of Garak!,"First of all, to answer a question posed by another reviewer of this book, yes Andrew Robinson wrote this book by himself--every single word! His total mastery of the voice of Garak in print ought to be a good clue to that though. I have never read a book before where the voice of the main character seemed to speak to me from the page. This is an amazing book and a ""must read"" for any Star Trek fan!"
5,"This never happens to me, but I could not put this book down.","I am a huge fan of ST:DS9 and one of my favorite characters from the show is Garak. So naturally when I found out there was a novel developing this character even further, written by the man himself. Well, not something I could easily pass up.Picking up the book with moderate enthusiasm, I was very soon enthralled. Read it cover to cover, a first.The novel explores 3 different timelines centering around our hero.1st - His long colorful journey from adolescents to his exile on DS9;2nd - His time spent on the station (filling in lapses between episodes);3rd - His struggles on a Cardassia ravaged by the end of Dominion occupation.The 3 timelines are masterfully woven together throughout the novel, which explores duty, betrayal, love and redemption.I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone. A great novel for both non and Trek-fans alike."
4,Very well written.,"I don't much care for the ""letter to Dr. Bashir"" style of the book, but it is certainly well-done, and if I find it hard to visualize the character of Elim Garak progressing through some of the stages outlined here, that is probably more my failure than the author's. Nowhere near my favorite Star Trek book, but well above the midpoint and certainly worth the read."
1,A stitch in time,"This book was the worst I have ever read. The author left me wondering were he was taking me. It was very hard to follow. Although this was a very ""Garak"" like story, I felt very disapointed."
3,No opinion,"I purchased this as a gift. It arrived fine. Because it's a gift, I have no opinion on it's actual quality, however, the supplier was prompt and it arrived in excellent condition."
1,Jimmy neutron,This game has been very frustating to my 5 year old.It was purchased from Amazon.com for his birthday. He is able to save the first level but it will not load.If he loses the first second level he has to start over.
2,"Very Bad, Waste of Money!","This game really stinks! Becouse the graphics are horrible, the characters look rediculous, and every character in the game looks chubby. Spend your money on a better game!"
1,never finished it so bad,didn't like it never finished it so bad i probably should return it I will have to call tomorrow during the day
1,Technical problems - poor quality,I was only able to watch about 20 minutes of the movie before the sound started getting funky and then the movie cut out altogether.
3,A few laughs,Good acting and some dark comedy. OK to pass the time if you haven't seen it. Second time was not as good since I knew the ending.
4,a fish called wanda,"This is a old classic. One of the funniest movies, but not for kids. ""kkkken is cccccoming to kkkill me!"""
4,A good ironic film,"A good ironic film, it's full of fun. Though it is old, it is expressive, ,especially on actor performance skills."
5,Quiet Mind: One Minute Retreats from a Busy World,"Thoughtful questions or ideas to consider as meditation, focus for the day, or a daily reminder for mindfulness. We know our bodies need rest and recovery; it is important to give our minds the same gift. There are interesting thoughts about every day events."
5,Quick and practical!,"This book is a quick and practical way to remind yourself of how easy it can be to relax and slow down in this busy world. All common sense reminders of all there is to appreciate in our everyday world. Even if you only have a few minutes, reading one or two little chapters can get you on the right track to slow down and breath and appreciate! Love it! Definitely a keeper!"
1,Thanks for nothing.. really,"I found this book ridiculously simplistic. Clearly I may actually not be stressed enough or busy enough to get value from this as I felt more stressed from frustration after reading the half baked simplistic and often confusing interpretations of famous quotations than before I picked up this book. I felt like I was reading a copy of powerpoint presentation from a seminar, or one of those quote of the day desk calendars. It provided very little useful information."
5,Very good little known show,"Last year there was a producton of Red Light Winter performed at my school. I thoroughly enjoyed it because Adam Rapp has a talent for creating believeable characters. This play is set in Amsterdam. Hence ""Red Light"" Winter. It follows two friends vacationing and the prostitute they stumble upon. What ensues is highly entertaining and fun. I would recommend this play to anyone who wants to escape through a play. When reading this play I feel like I am in Amsterdam. A great read."
2,This might be better on stage,"This play (and this playwright) have been getting a lot of attention in the last couple of years, so I was expecting something new and exciting. There was nothing really new here, however. It is pretty straitforward realism, with a fairly interesting story set-up: 2 young American friends, traveling around Amsterdam together, both get attracted to the same woman. She only likes one of them - arrogant, entertaining, hotshot Davis, who has no intention of taking her seriously. Lonely, melancholy playwright Matt might really appreciate her, but he does not turn her on. The girl is a French prostitute who is quiet and sweet and apparently looking for a cool American boyfriend. The dialogue is not very interesting, pretty standard college guy talk. I got bored after 10-15 pages and skipped to the end. It was not terrible, but if this is the best he has got, then Adam Rapp is not on his way to being the next Albee or Miller."
1,"Poorly Made, Inaccurate Listing","First of all, I ordered two sets of these and received only 10 per package, not 12 as the listing states.Second, and more importantly, as others have reported, these things are absolutely useless garbage. They don't stay closed or they have holes and can't be filled at all.I tried to use these for my son's school Halloween party but, of the 20 I received only ONE was both leak-free and had a functioning closure.Big waste of money. Avoid!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I was looking forward to decorating for Halloween with these, but more than half of them will not hold air. the plug persists in popping out, even when it is reinforced with duct tape. Extremely poor quality."
2,It's ok,"I think this toy is not on of the better Bratz. Infacr I don't really like any of the I-Candy dolls! because it's not really that much fun to play with since the only other shoes they can wear are boots! but I do llove EVERY SINGLE BRAT DOLL THERE IS OUT THERE, and hey if you or your kid likes it who the heck am I to put it down? GO BUY IT NOW!"
5,She looks wierd in this picture but all dolls faces are different,"This doll looks really wierd in this picture.But it could just be pictures.Well,this doll does`nt come with alot of accesories like they usually do,but the outfit she is wearing is not the best but nice.It`s a blue and white shirt with one pink and one white sleeve with a purple denim looking skirt and a silver vest with pink leggings and blue jelly shoes.She does`nt come with alot of accesories like I sais before,but she has a purse the same colors as her outfit,pink stud earrings,a blue comb and a sticker for a collectible.Please vote my review helpful.I hope you have a happy valentines day!"
4,Gotta love those hot-pink legs. :-),"I happened to be in a local toy store (I'm a 39 year old man, but I collect Johnny Lightning cars) when just for the heck of it, I decided to stroll through the part of the store where they have these Bratz dolls. My eyes immediately focused on this doll with her oh-so-beautiful hot-pink legs, and the doll right next to her had orange legs! What a novel idea... if only I could get my gf to wear tights like those, she'd look even prettier than she does now. I recently inherited a few Barbies from someone close to me who passed away (hey, what are you laughing about? There's nothing wrong with a man collecting valuable dolls), and my only complaint about the Bratz I-Candy dolls is that they weren't designed with poseable legs.But my point is... if you're a young lass who loves to wear tights, or if you're like me, a man who enjoys seeing his gf in tights, then you've GOTTA get this doll."
2,ECK!,"I LOVE YASMIN BUT THIS,, THIS ANINT YASMIN. THIS DOLL IS UHHGLY AND I HATE THE PINK!!YUK! THIS IS NOT THE YASMIN I LOVE!! THIS IS JUST, NOT YASMIN-LIKE! SHE'S NOT A GIRLY-GIRL, SHE'S TOUGH, LIKE ME, AND SOMEONE TOOK AWAY HER NATURAL, BAD GIRL CHARM WHEN MAKING THIS DOLL! I AM NOT A FAN OF I-CANDY DOLLS!!I DON'T RECOMEND THEM!!"
2,The pink is TOO much...,Eh... No offence MGA but this doll is an insult to Yasmin. The pink looks too bright and utterly horrid on her. She is the worst I'd have to say out of the I-Candy collection. I hate to say it but this is makign me reconsider starting to collect Yasmin...
1,GROSS,YASMIN IS THE WORST ONE IN THE I CANDY COLLETION.HER EYES AND MOUTH AND FACE IS SOOOOO UGLY.THIS COLLETION IS NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE BRATZ COLLECTION.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
5,"Love, Sex and Tractors","I have all of Rogers Books and each one gets better. Love,sex and Tractors was by far the the best. He continues to keep the reader laughing. It is the most thought provoking and informational book I have read in a long time. The only thing that would improve his books would be to paint his tractor pitured on the cover green with yellow wheels."
4,Where were the tractors?,"I enjoy reading Mr. Welsch's tractor books, often laughing out loud (and driving my wife crazy). I enjoyed the anecdotes about friends and females, but missed the tractor stories. Maybe it has all been done? I think not. The problems overcome and the lessons learned in ""Old Men . . ."" and ""Busted Tractors . . ."" were rich in both amusement and (some) educational value. This book, unfortunately, left me empty at the end. Funny stories, but a little too much on the ""Love and Sex"" part; and yet, in some ways, not enough. Read it, enjoy it, but don't expect as much as his first two tractor books."
4,Fun-n-ny!,"For the man who loves his tools, this book is a hoot! We see the development of a man through the various stages of marriage and raising a family. Get it for the man in your life."
1,Not for me,"I loved this author's Shingling the Fog and my wife has read and liked other books by him. But Love, Sex and Tractors is a tasteless dud. It rambles along at a slow and boring pace, and just isn't funny. In fact we were put off by negative remarks about women (written in jest, but where's the joke?). Buy something else by Mr. Welsch."
2,Phantom of the Auditorium,"I usually like Goosebumps,but Phantom of the Auditorium was reallly boring and overpriced.Goosebumps books want you to read on and every word is spineshivering,but this one didn't really have any of those things.I would not reccomend this book for anybody."
4,All was ok,"Después de los problemas con el primer envio, ahora está todo correcto. El pedido llegó a tiempo y en buen estado"
3,"Looks great, plays badly.","I got this fighter for my 5-year-old for Christmas. It looks fantastic. A very impressive vehicle. However, you really can't play with it. The wings snap on weakly and fall off easily. I tried ""flying"" it myself and it just falls apart. This is definitely more for the older collector. It is huge, though, so you'll need a pretty big shelf!"
3,Cat and Mouse in a Hanted House,"Haha!!!!!! It a funny book. Geronimo Stilton thinks that he's being haunted by a cat ghost, mummy, witch, owl, and a vampire. He calls Thea and he tells her that he saw a ghost. So she rushes over to the castle. Thea brought Geronimo's cousin trap and he's favorite nephew Benjamin. Trap tricked Geronimo. Geronimo thought it was the ghost. It was funny. Geronimo called thea because he was sacred."
5,a spooky night for geronimo and a hysterical night for thea and trap,this is a great book! It is about how geronimo's car brakes down as he goes for a visit at his grandmother sweetpaw's summer cabin in the dark woods. But of course he stumbles upon a huaunted old castle. Where the great Cannycats lived for million's of years. And so he calls his sister thea and guess what she says! If you are at a castle then pick a room and hit the sack!! But geronimo says he see's a ghost cat with a sliced off paw! and everytime he hears a CRRREEAAKK!!! So to find out what happends next read the book. called CAT AND MOUSE IN A HAUNTED HOUSE.
2,Not necessarily appropriate for young readers!,"My 5 year old started reading the first two in this series and really enjoyed both of them. This one, however, gave him nightmares. Psychologically, it's probably more appropriate for 8 and 9 year olds. Younger kids may not be able to cope with the ""scary"" figures (ghosts, etc.) in this story."
2,"Geronimo Stilton is a negative, winey wimp","I started reading the Geronimo Stilton books to my 7 year old son to try to get him more interested in reading. He enjoys books, but the more of them you read the more you realize that Geronimo Stilton is not a good infulence. We curently on book #9 and this it no more.Geronimo Stilton is constantly complaining and wining. He is pushed around and manipulated by his sister, his cousin, and to a certain extent his sweet little nephew. The books are very formulaic. In almost every book I have read so for our hero, Geronimo Stilton, is dranged into an adventure kicking and screaming like a two year old throwing a fit. He eventually has fun in the end but on the way he excessly complains and wines the entire time. I have never read any childrens book before with phrase ""I hate .."" in it so many times. If you want a positive role infulence on your child through reading this isn't it."
1,Wasted money,"Buy any other review out there. This is a total waste of time. too technical of questions and didnt benefit whatsoever for actual shelves. I have heard the others are much better but not sure of the name, pre-test i believe."
3,It comes in ONE/BLACK!,"The picture shown on ads may lead some confusion to customer: The picture tells the customer the actual product including 2 caps one in Black and one in Beige(or Vanilla Cream..). The reality is, on arrival it comes in ONE cap, in Black color. I strongly urge the seller to remove the other mouthpiece cap if they only have BLACK to sell and no choices for customer to avoid confusion. Other than this, the cap is good but loose same as written in most reviews and require additional attention to your reed if the cap falls off."
3,Songs from the past,"A lot of laughs from the old old hillbilly music, not quite what I expected but enjoyable just the Sam."
4,The Best of Angela Bofill...,A fairly good collection of her best songs. Get it at a good price and give it a listen. Four stars!!
1,Waste of Money,Only 608 words = ~ $1.00 per word with nothing of value add included. Put your $5.98 in your savings account instead
5,Great for sensitive skin,"These clippers are great for the African-American who wants the ability to have a clean shave without the razor bumps and ingrown hairs that ususally follow. Personally, I use this set for the head and face. I have medically sensitive skin and this was the only set I was ever able to use without any problems.Even though this clipper is for beards and mustaches, it can also be used on the head(though Im not sure if that affects the longevity of the clipper). The head of the clipper tilts to better enable you to put the right angle on the right area. It's ability to shape and corner the edges of a beard or the thin lines of a goatee is worth mentioning. It also comes with a comb that you can adjust to the length that you want your hair to be restricted to.The use life is decent as well. The one I currently have is beginning to seriously decline in performance and I have had it for roughly 4 yrs."
1,Food sticks,"I had a teflon coated grill/griddle before this one that I used for years. I'm not sure of the brand but I didn't pay a lot for it, but after years of use the teflon finally started chipping & so I decided to buy this one.I thought I'd try a non-teflon solution so that I wouldn't have to worry about eventual peeling. Well, please learn from my mistake. This griddle is horrible. It stained from the first use. I could have lived with that if the performance was good. I don't think cookware needs to be a display item. Foods stick - period. I don't care how low or high you set the heat. I tried spray oil, I also tried brushing on a thick coat of cooking oil. After my last batch of botched pancakes, I have sworn off using this thing ever again. I'm buying a new teflon one."
3,It's not perfect but...,"it does seem like it's made to last. It has more of a cast iron feel to it than my old nonstick grill. I was looking for one that wasn't going to flake or peel and liked the idea of it being double sided. I didn't have an indoor grill before this. At first it didn't seem to work well because my pancakes stuck a little and were not browning the same way the did on the nonstick, but then I adjusted how much cooking spray I used and made sure I preheated it very well before putting the batter on and they came out better. I've only cooked hotdogs on the grill side but they came out fine. It's heavy and needs to cool down before moving to the sink for cleanup, but that's expected."
5,Fantastic griddle,"I love this griddle. I've had it 2 months now and I use it nearly everyday for everything from breakfast to dinner. Food cooks quickly and evenly, leaving those great grill marks. It's light weight, sturdy and easy to clean. It's also beginning to take on that lovely black patina like cast iron. It's one of the best cookware purchases I've ever made."
3,"Works fine, if you know the trick","The first time I used this product I discovered the trick to using it, USE LOTS OF COOKING SPRAY. In fact, more than you think you need. I used enough to cover the pan, and my food stuck terribly. So the next time I used it I oversaturated it, and it worked wonderfully. Very even cooking, and the defrost feature is fantastic in a pinch.For some reason mine stained the first time I used it, despite the fact that I submerged it in soapy water the second I was done. I've tried to get the stain out to no avail. That kind of bothers me.Overall, this product does what it should, as long as you know the trick!"
2,It warped,"I didn't get mine here, but thought I should share a potential problem beyond the issues with sprays/oils etc. Mine has WARPED; as solid as it is that was not a possibility I ever thought of, nor is it one I have ever encountered with any other double griddle, even cheaper ones. It is now useless as the warping prevents an even heat distribution."
3,Only fits standard/smaller tandem strollers,"This Graco cover might be good for some strollers, but is too small for my roomy Jeep Wagoneer Tandem stroller. Just look at the picture on this web page here: it shows a plastic cover stretched to the maximum just to cover the top of a similar Jeep double stroller... it won't even cover the front passenger's legs! Also tried the ""Jolly Jumper"" rain cover from a local Toys R' Us. It's also made of heavy plastic, and covers only 3/4 of the top of my stroller. If you have a bigger than average tandem/duo stroller, try the Tandem Stroller Rain Cover from ""Protect-A-BubUSA.com""; or ""StrollerSunShades.ca"" if you're in Canada. Their rain cover not only fits all strollers big and small, but dries well and fast, and folds in seconds. It's light, soft, waterproof and keeps my kids warm, dry yet well ventilated. Definitely worth the money!"
2,"Works, but could have been much better.","It's bulky, it's ill-fitting, but it'll keep kids dry. The plastic isn't high quality and is very inflexible in cold weather. It's much more useful in warm or hot weather, but then, it's a furnace. Be VERY careful that kids don't overheat."
1,How about for single strollers????,"What happened to the one for single strollers? I only have one child, but he gets just as wet in the rain!"
3,A bit boring for me.,"The Chess Artist was a bit boring to me. I found the main characters Glenn and the author very interesting. I found the telling of their exploits in America and the minor characters that they encounter in America very interesting. However, most of the story takes place in Kalmakia, Russia, and this did not keep my interest at all. In general, the writing is very good, so I may come back to this book at a later date."
3,Well written and interesting but boring,"The Chess Artist was a bit boring for me. I found the main characters in the book, Glenn Umstead and the author very intriguing. This book is really a diary of chess adventures of these two men. I found the telling of their exploits in America and the minor characters that they encounter in America very interesting. However, most of the story takes place in Kalmakya, Russia, and this did not keep my interest at all. So most of the book is pretty boring. In general, the writing is very good, so I may come back to this book at a later date."
4,"The chess puzzle, is it a puzzle?","Please look at the chess puzzle on p.208 of Hallman's book, then try his solution (marked with an asterisk). Any reactions?"
3,Depressing,"Frankly, I did not finish this book. I read about half of it and found it seamy and depressing. There are no games or diagrams in the book."
4,See the world through the lens of a game,"I really enjoyed this book. Hallman is prodigiously gifted, he has a hawklike eye for detail, a great talent for description and metaphor, a novelist's sense of momentum and organization and a heart ready to sympathize with screw-ups and strays. At their best his chess adventures reach a Huck and Jim pitch. He is an outsider writing critically about the appeal of the game and the lives of people who devote themselves to it. I think this is a great book for anyone getting into the game, or just looking for a thoughtful book."
5,Great Book,"This is a great read even if you hate chess,this is by far my favorite book about a chess player or players( I have read 3 others ,see my reviews)I would like to read a sequel to it.I was captivated by, and enthralled with this book!Hallman is a great writer, please write more books on chess players,maybe follow Nakamura and write about it!."
3,"Interesting at times, but it doesn't quite satisfy","The Chess Artist contains some interesting observations about the game, and the occasional worthwhile excursus, but it never quite closes in on an interesting story. This may be because so much of it is built on intentionally arbitrary encounters, events seemly engineered to generate something to write about (e.g. chess games played in prisons, or among a museum's Duchamp collection). I enjoyed it, and I learned something, but I had hoped for more."
5,A slept on BANGER of 06!,"AIte, Ill be tha first to say, im overall impressed with the this album, the production is good......Mighty Mi, Mondee, CamuTao and DUsted Dons are on the production here.....Guest appearances by Yak Ballz, Grandmaster Flash, and Camu Tao, and CAGE are excellent, Yak explodes on the hooks of 'Say Cheese' And 'Antidote' and Camu' does an great JOb on the hook on 'Cutty Sharks', Cage' appearance on 'Bi POlar ROllers'sounds sum of like the old cage I know, ITS also got vast aire, aesop, pretty much the entire weathermen crew on here............Dusted Dons and Tame 1, are on it on this cd, sum of these dusted cats can FLOW on this s**t...... the entire vibe is dark, grimy and str8 up lyrical.....chek this album out......It will be im MAD rotation for quite a while"
3,They could've done better.,"I wanted to give this album a 4. But really couldn't. Too many of the songs sounded really just the same kind of thing over and over again. Listening to the previews, I thought the CD would be sick. That wasn't the case though. As I listened, I started to get a little bored with the songs. These guys are real lyricists, but the songs lacked some kind of excitement, it might be the production. They need to stick with the few producers on the album that were good, and not let other clowns mess with their lyrics."
5,Bluetooth Does do Dial-Up,"Previous reviewer is incorrect. The PM-325 will do DUN (Dial-Up Networking). You just have to have Bluetooth software (like Widcom) on your computer that can discover the services of the phone. I've only had the phone for a day, so I don't have a complete review, but wanted to correct the misperception."
1,Extremely Disappointing!!!,"I bought this phone for the full price from Sprint for its Bluetooth capability, and not only is the Bluetooth limited, but, worst of all, the phone shuts off, as others here have described. The first phone I got from Sprint started doing this in four weeks, and by six weeks' time I had to complain and get a new phone. I was given a refurbished phone (free) as a replacement, and now, four weeks later, it's doing it again. I have never had this problem with a cell phone before. Even my first cell phone in the 1990s worked better than this one."
2,The LG PM-325 is a lightweight,"Although the phone looks and acts cool, it's pretty gutless. I like the size and weight of the phone, and the sliding keyboard is OK. The Bluetooth feature doesn't support data transfer - it's only for a wireless headset/earbud. The contact list only holds 200 entries, and each one of those will only take one phone number. If you use your phone to maintain a contact list with multiple entries for each contact, forget about this one. I've had this LG PM-325 for one day - I will likely be buying a Treo next week.It's too bad these phones come with useless built in sounds and graphics, but are short on usable features. Who needs a manatee swimming away when you turn the phone off? Another reviewer called the PM-325 a ""kid's phone"" - I have to agree.I got the phone for $69.00 through Sprint. The last time I checked Wirefly, they were giving them away (well, free with a rebate)."
2,Looks neat but does't work great.,"When I first go this phone, I absoultely LOVED it. Although my honeymoon with this phone only lasted about 4 months. All of a sudden the battery life seems to be diminishing right before my eyes. I can completely power up the phone, and within 20 mins of talking the phone will start beeping because of a low battery. Sometimes the phone will go haywire and the buttons you push will do the exact opposite of what you're trying to do. At times the # button does not work. The volume on the phone may seem loud, but if you are driving on the highway, even with the windows up you will struggle to hear what the person is saying.Overall this phone is good for about 4-5 months, and then it will start to become a piece of crap. Another thing that stinks on the phone is that it doesn't take very good pictures, and there is no flash. Overall this is a cheaply made phone that does not last. [...] I can't wait till I've had the phone for a year so I can replace it with another one!"
5,"Great Phone, Good Bluetooth Functionality , No Regrets Here...",I bought this phone 2 months ago and I must say that I am truly happy with its Functionality. I have not experienced the shutting-off that some people talk about here. I bought the latest Motorola HS850 Bluetooth earpiece for this phone and the results are great. I love the fact that the phone is nice and compact and it really looks styling too. The menu on this phone is also very user friendly. I have compared prices from other Bluetooth phones from other cell phone companies and I must say this cell phone is amongst the best deal in feature comparisons.
4,LG PM 325,"The LG PM 325 is the first LG product that I have ever used. I believe the phone is a very good product all the way around as far as the pictures, size of the phone, LCD screen and the other eatures such the slide open feature.When uploading pictures, the phone does take longer time than expected.Scott"
4,Why does the power go off?,This phone has been pretty good for the most part but I'm baffled as to why it powers itself off throughout the day...I'll be in between sales calls wondering why it's a slow day and no one is calling me when I pull the phone from the holster and realize that it's been turned off by itself...I saw some comments from others noting the same thing!
1,Don't buy,"Despite its goofy looks, at first I liked this phone. Then, it inexplicably stopped working as I was using the WAP browser. I took it to the Sprint store and they told me I needed to send it to LG. After going through a rather annoying sending process, I receive a letter saying that the product has ""main board bent.""I called the number they listed and asked them how that could happen. The guy told me it could have been stepped on. Needless to say, the worst thing that had ever happened to the phone was being put in a pocket. It's unbelieveable that a phone could be so fragile. Frankly, I think this is a racket. Now, I have two choices: pay $180 to LG for a replacement or buy a new phone. So much for warantees. I would give this 0 stars, were it an option."
1,"No other way to put it, this phone is a POS...","I purchased this phone specifically for it's Bluetooth connectivity. Only to find that it would only allow me to connect to the internet via the Sprint server, and then charge me God knows what per minute to do that. Aside from it's LACK of Bluetooth, everyonce in a while, the ""3, 6, 9, #, UP, and RIGHT"" buttons will cease to work. And then, mysteriously work again. Needless to say, that either trying input a number or scrolling through your phone list is greatly impaired with out those buttons. Aside from it's silly looks, stupid slide, and half screen, this phone takes the cake as the worst cell phone I've ever owned."
5,so much fun,I loved to read this book with my mother. We would sit & study the pictures for what felt like hours. One of my favorite books as a child!
3,American Life ?,"This song is not really a favorite of mine, however being a Madonna fan, I bought the cd singles of this song( 2 were released in Australia).I hated the red version of the remixes, but found a great version on the blue cd single that I really liked.It is called Felix Da Housecat remix.Now, whenever I listen to this song, this is the version that I listen to.It is much better than the album version I think.Good buy for all Madonna fans."
3,"Board is cheap, but it works!","The most disappointing thing about this was how thin the board is. I remember ones like these when I was a kid where the board would weigh itself down; not the case with this one. Probably won't play backgammon so maybe I'll just attach that side to some cardboard or something thicker. Overall, worth the price."
1,Cheap,the board is more like poster board than game board. I bought 3. They were all warped and the pieces aren't heavy enough to hold it down. the same quality as the one I got for a quarter in a clearance bin at the dollar store.
3,Meh,The checker/chess board is so cheap. I didn't realize it would be made of thin paper. The instructions for the games are written in English so that's a plus.
2,"Usable, but not for long","While I cannot fault the seller for these items, they are nothing but cheap junk. The boards are flimsy and warped. Some of the pieces I received were chipped and broken, even though it was a new set. I can use them for our chess program, but will probably have to purchase new ones in the future."
1,Do not buy this item!,"Not even worth five bucks. In fact, because I have to return it... it is costing me time and time is money. The board was completely warped and the red checkers were non-existant!"
3,Just Ok,I bought this for a child and when it came I was disappointed. It was very flimsy and I do not think it will last long.
1,disappointed,My son has been wanting to learn to play chess so we ordered this inexpensive set. Warning - this is not like the inexpensive sets we used to be able to get. The board is VERY cheap and doesn't even lie flat. The pieces are cheap as well. One of our pawns was missing part of the top. VERY disappointed with the set and would recommend you look elsewhere.
3,You get what you paid for,"The quality is exactly what one would expect for the price: pieces are very light and if you are playing on a bed or a semi soft carpet will fall; the box is made of a very soft cardboard and bends out of shape making it difficult to close; the board folds nicely, but does not lay flat when opened causing the pieces to slide a bit. Good starter set - I don't feel bad when pieces get lost, because each lost piece brings me closer to buyin a new, more durable & usable, set."
3,Good,"Every one had some version of this exact game set growing up, no need for the hundred dollar wood/table sets."
1,Poor quality,"This game is very poor quality. We opened the game and the board was already warped and pieces don't slide well. Cheap, Cheap, cheap quality for a high price. not happy!"
1,Cheap! Don't buy!,I was looking for a beginner checker/ chess set for my 10 year old nephew. Terrible game. Everything about this game was cheaply made. The board was very thin cardboard. The game pieces were okay. Very expensive for what you get.
2,limited to heterosexual activity,"I purchased this book thinking it would be all encompassing of the selling of sex in the Carribean. Sadly, the author limits herself to just the women looking for 'companionship' and not the men who also are looking for 'companionship'."
5,Couldn't put it down,Take this book with you on your next flight...you will read until the plane is at your destination gate. Wonderful character development...can't wait to read her next book!
3,"Not believable, but good read","The good aspects are that she mixes fiction with non-fiction information and philosophical passages. It has nice short chapters, with hooks to make you want to read another. The characters are well-developed, but that is part of the reason the pace is slow.The story seems realistic, but then you have to deal with tremendous coincidence and I couldn't accept that. The end is disappointing in that it's not as detailed as the rest of the story and many questions are left unanswered. At the same time, it's somewhat predictable. There's are no major twists, so it becomes somewhat boring at the finish.I think the big picture, however, is that this book mainly deals with philosophical and psychological issues and the story is used to illustrate these.It was an easy relaxing beach or bedtime read for me."
1,Boring,I knew in the first 20 pages who would've abducted the child. It was way too predictable and I got so frustrated with the slow pace that I skipped a big chunk of the book just so I can read the final pages and felt like I didn't miss a thing. Please spend your money elsewhere.
2,Depressing,"This book is about a woman who looses her future step dauguter. They were on the beach in the fog, and the woman looked away for a moment, and then the 8 year old girl was gone. This book is about her search to find her.This story is heartbreaking. The dispair that people feel when they loose someone they love is clearly translated to the reader. I only give this 2 stars because it was depressing to read."
1,Year of Fog,Did not like! It was way too wordy and the ending wasn't what I would imagine happening. It could have been better if the author didn't go back to her younger years or talk about other subjects such as psychology inputs and how her camera worked. I only read it to the end to see what happened to Emma.
2,Skim through most of it,"The Year of Fog seemed to have great potential...a soon-to-be stepmother, Abby, is left to care for her future stepdaughter while her fiance is away for the weekend. While at the beach, the young girl disappears without a trace. The entire book is devoted to the search for the young girl and Abby's efforts to recollect the events of that day.Sounds like it could be good. But I found this to be too long and uneventful. I had read about 250 pages and two things had happened...the girl had disappeared and a shoe was found. I felt as though too much happened too early in the book, then nothing for hundreds of pages. I found myself skimming through most of it looking to pick up important parts. And the ending was disappointing, leaving you hanging as to what happens to Abby and with her relationships with the other characters.This one had potential but was much too wordy, making me lose interest very quickly."
2,boring memory info,A very long and overly narrative regarding memory research. Very much pie in the sky without meaningful or interesting envelope of delivery.
1,Where is the Story?,"This book was a whooooole lot of navel gazing, ridiculous feats of math (repeated ad nauseum) and then more navel gazing. In the first few pages a little girl vanishes, and apparently we are supposed to spend the entire length of a novel on how agonizing that is. I thought that by listening to the audio version I would at least be able to get through it when I had nothing else to do. Unfortunately, driving in silence was more entertaining. Read the spoilers and get the whole story in a paragraph. Don't worry, you won't miss anything."
3,Strangely Suspenseful,"I really enjoyed this book strangely suspenseful book. Though it did have a few downsides - the pacing and its credibility. At times, it moved sooo very slowly and once the plot unfolded, it was really rather unbelievable. Still, the characters were interesting enough that I would read another book by this author - but I probably will be able to wait a while before beginning one. It certainly wasn't an awful book, and there was a certain amount of tension to it, but when coupled with the slow pacing, it left the book feeling a bit odd. I wish it had a better ending... a little more concrete of a conclusion would have been nice."
5,THE YEAR OF FOG,"I LOVED THIS BOOK! THE PREMISE IS,OF COURSE, THE MOST DEVASTATING THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A FAMILY... BUT THIS BOOK IS SO BEAUTIFULLY PACED,THE CHARACTERS SO WELL DRAWN,THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO READ. YOU REALLY FEEL FOR ABBY AND JAKE,THEIR LIVES SO SHATTERED. AND IT WASN'T A TYPICAL CANNED ENDING,BUT ONE SO SAD,BUT ALSO SO HOPEFUL.... MICHELLE, KEEP WRITING. YOU HAVE A RARE TALENT..."
2,downer,"I hate when I dislike a book that everyone is talking about as the greatest page turner. I found it depressing and slow. So slow, that YES, it was a page turner so I could hurry and press on to see if the story got deeper and/or better. The book is highly repetitive and longs for more substance. The storyline was a parents worst nightmare and the ending highly unrealistic yet hopeful so that is where the 2 stars come from."
3,Fun to Read but not a Must Read!,"It was fun to read, but I don't think it was great! I don't recommend it as a must read, but it was entertaining. Her search was monotonous to read and you knew she wasn't going to find her until the year was up based on the title of the book. We read it for book club and only one person really loved it. I wish the author had spent more time writing about what happened after she found the girl and not so much on the endless search, I feel like it was repetitive. There were a lot of unbelievable details that I just couldn't accept."
3,Not perfect but good reading.,"Yes, this book needed a little editing. But forgive the repetition and settle in to experience a woman haunted by guilt and regret over a disappearance she probably couldn't have averted. I thought the author portrayed her feelings in a way that rang true and she made her obsession seem warranted. The ending might have been a little abrupt, but it surprised me, and I like that in a book. A little over long in the middle, this is a good story, and a satisfying mystery."
3,"""Redbook"" fiction","The repetition is exhausting, but perhaps that is the way it is when a child is lost. Upon finishing the book, I felt that the novel could have been edited down to ""Redbook"" fiction."
4,"Suspenseful, Edge-of-Your-Seat Reading","The Year of Fog is a suspenseful, well written drama that kept me frantically turning the pages to find out how it was going to end. The characters at the center of the novel are a young woman, her fiance, and his young daughter from a previous marriage who goes missing in the first chapter. The focus of the novel is the search for the girl and the emotional fallout for the woman and her fiancé as the months drag on.Richmond's writing style is captivating and her plot pacing was really good during most of the novel. I was a bit disappointed with the last few chapters because I felt she had begun to rush the sequencing of events. It felt like she was trying to quickly wrap the novel up. Despite that, I still recommend readers pick up this novel because the depth of emotions and the intensity of the drama the main character is forced to reckon with are compelling."
3,Slow and very repeatitive,This book is very repetitive and the story could really have been told in half the amount of pages. I found myself skimming pages and being disengaged from the characters because it was very slow.
3,Not worth remembering...,"The beginning of this book got your attention, but went downhill from there.....no character development.....repetitive descriptions all the way through the novel....boring and wordy narratives on memory....read ""Deep End of the Ocean"" for a much more captivating look at a child's kidnapping and the mystery surrounding it.....this book makes the reader feel as if we were somehow in a FOG!!"
2,Did I read the same book the other reviewers did?,"Actually, I listened to an unabridged audio book, and I thought it was the most painfully slow book I have ever read in my life. It was fairly well-written, but I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Finally, it did, and the book was still crawling along. I really wasted my money on this one, and the only reason it got two stars rather than one is that it was well-written - but it surely could have used some pacing and plot."
3,This book needs a good editor,"This was an okay book, but it was too long and repetitive. I found myself skimming through the endless search scenes. And, in the end, I found the behavior of the main characters a little hard to believe. The protangonist was really a victim. This was no random kidnapping, yet the boyfriend didn't seem to understand that his messed up family stole a year from this poor woman's life. I wanted to smack him in the end."
2,Longest short-story I've ever read...,"This book would have made a great short-story. As a novel, however, it's more like an exercise in tedium. I think the publisher has it right, The Year of Fog is a real ""spare page-turner"" (it has a lot of spare pages). Aside from the fact that there are at least 70 chapters wherein nothing happens bookended by two major events, the author seems to lack experience in writing authentic dialogue. I didn't believe any of the conversations that occurred and I felt too often like the author was trying too hard to impress her readers with all the research she did upon writing this book."
5,Captivating!,"I read it cover to cover in 2 nights. I never do that. From the very first sentence, you're sucked in. All in all it was a great story. A little slow in the middle, but bearable. Highly recommend!"
2,The Year of Fog,"While the book had some very intriguing parts that kept me going, mostly it was very slow. Not one I would read twice."
2,Will it ever end?,"I certainly have a different opinion than most about this book which I found tedious and mundane to say the least. Story telling at it's longest, get on with the story please. This book could have been 100 pages shorter. Too much extra stuff no one cares about which was just plain long and unnecessary blah, blah. I wish I had the time back I spent reading it even though I have deep compassion for parents and loved ones suffering with child abductions and my heart aches for them; this book, however, takes it (my emotions) somewhere else where I was more agitated with the whole story than I was compassionate."
2,Skim-able,"I agree with several reviewers on the premise that this book is very slow and many times, I found myself skimming not only pages, but entire chapters. The relationship between Abby and Jake seemed shallow and could have been much more richly developed. And the ending was horrible - so much left unsaid between the two of them. I would have given this book three stars - it was at least a decent way to pass some time - but the ending left me so flat I had to take a star away."
3,A little long-winded...,"While the story itself is rather good and you end up feeling for the characters. This book could have and SHOULD have been much shorter. There are about 20 chapters where nothing happens and you don't miss anything by skimming the pages to where something does. Save your time and read Jodi Piccoult, you get the same type of stories and a more captivating style of writing where you don't even think about skipping pages."
3,Good but too long,"I agree with a lot of these reviews, this book is a great premise, but lost something in its length. Abby the narrator was a complex heroine and I did enjoy when the story went back to her past. I never fully understood Jake and Abby's relationship; I think he would have just gotten rid of her when Emma went missing. Why Nick came into play and how convenient to have a rich and successful man walk into Abby's life seemed a little farfetched. If this novel was maybe 275 pages, it would have been better; there were a lot of times I read ahead. I found way too many details throughout the story that were not necessary. I still think Michelle Richmond is a talented writer and this novel is worth reading, it just wasn't the best I've read. If Amazon had 3 stars that is what I would rate this novel."
3,Petered out in the end....,Entertaining if you are able to accept that a huge coincidence is part of the story; you must accept this or the story seems contrived. I guess it didn't seem believable or realistic to me. When I got to the end I felt like I wanted some sort of reason for having read the book. I felt like it just pooped out...
2,Ehhh...,"This book is frustrating and boring. There are interesting photography bits, but mostly overdone. For the most part, the style of writing is bland, and though the story definitely starts off with a bang with a child's disappearance, nothing of significance happens until the last few pages of the novel. So that leaves over a hundred pages of constantly mulling over the same details and the same images of a strained relationship. It's a sad story, but mostly one-note, and I will probably never read a book by Michelle Richmond again."
2,big disappointment,"I chose this book because it said on the cover ""Highly recommended for fans of authors like Jodi Picoult..."" Well Jodi is my favorite author, and I feel insulted by the comparison--like that statement was nothing better than false advertising. This book started with a very interesting premise, but was just too implausible from start to finish. I hesitate to mention which parts of the plot were too unrealistic to be believed, because that would definitely ruin the story for anyone who wants to give it a try, but most of this would never happen. It dragged on and on with nothing to hold the reader's interest. I would not recommend this book, but might consider giving this author one more try if another of her books looked interesting to me. Maybe. The writing wasn't terrible, it just lacked excitement and believability. Some of the reviews on the cover described the book as suspenseful, which it was not, and keeping the reader ""on the edge of your beach chair."" Sorry, I can't agree."
2,Super disappointing....:(,"I was excited to read this book when my friend gave it to me and I started it right away. The beginning was great and I was immediately drawn in, but after awhile I became bored with the endless amount of chapters that went on and on about searching and accounts of Abby's past. Eventually I gave up and skimmed through the book, reading here and there until I got to the end. Once there I was shocked at the treatment of Abby after all she had gone though to find Emma, and especially after the fact that she was the only one who didn't give up the search for her. Jake was just basically saying ""Um thanks for finding her, have a nice life."" That really angered me and made me dislike the book even more, I spent 90% of the book waiting for it to get better, then nothing. It should have been alot shorter too, 400 pages is too long for the type of story that this tells."
1,A waste of your time,"We read this for book club, and 6 out of 6 of us HATED this book. The narrator is selfish, concerned more about how she will look at the end, than of the little girl. The reading level is elementary, chocked full of juvenile dialog. You want to finish the book and forget it ever existed."
3,The Year of Log...,"because this is how it read, like a log of events in Abby's life-the people she met (often interesting characters, but little development in any of them) and the things she did. I didn't find the ruminations on memory or on Abby's memories too bothersome (in fact, I was more interested in her past relationship with Ramon than her present one with Jake), but I did find some aspects of the plot implausible, most notably, that Abby was able to resolve the situtation as she did. And it all seemed a bit ham-handed, child goes missing on a beach, child is found on a beach. The three stars are for the interesting descriptions of the places Abby traveled and the people she met. A fair to solid read, but not the must-read its been touted to be."
1,Felt like a Year of Fog,"It felt like a year of fog reading this never ending book. It started out realistic with the sinking feeling that accompanies a lost child but about 200 pages of the novel delves into ""why can't I remember"". I wish I could forget I read it. And please - child abduction - the FBI gets involved. Since when does the ex-wife get a free pass on that one?The ending was pathetic - thanks for proving you love us - now hit the road? Don't waste your time on this insipid story."
2,"Boring, Boring, Borig","I agree that this book needed a better editor or critic before it was published. It was a simple story but took forever to tell with too, too much detail and repetitive memories. I found myself skimming the whole middle of the book just to get to the solution. It was a bit unbelievable that this could happen the way the story goes on and on to tell you about. Not a good read !"
5,"Gripping, Page Turner","I could not put this book down! I found it fascinating. It's so good, I won't give anything away. I'm gonna make your curosity get the better of you and you'll ""have to"" buy it. A few surprises and twists make it even more exciting. I dare you not to peek near the end of the book for the answers you seek!"
4,Wonderful AND Disappointing,"I bought this as a Gold Box offer. Then, I saw the version that has a part that the children write on. I wish I could have paid a little more and received the upgraded version.Before you buy the LeapPad Advantage, look at the LeapPad Plus Writing.My daughter does enjoy the LeapPad. It's not her favorite thing like lots of children, but we got it for the educational value more than for entertainment."
2,Weak Content,"Great product idea, but uneven implementation. The sound quality should be much better. And some of the modules, such as reading, are pretty good. Other modules, however, are weak on content. I found that the science and nature modules are particularly superficial. Touch the wand to an animal and you get a couple of simple facts. It would be so much better to provide real insight into the animal's behaviors and habitat. So, in summary, for the science modules, you're better off buying a good book and reading to your child."
1,quality control/durability needs improving,I put the batteries in and the book started then we turned the page and the thing just quit. I have changed the batteries several times doing exactly what the instructions say and it does not work. The toy looks like so much fun I hope I can find one that works!
2,Disappointing,"While the some of the stories play with our expectations (Scott Aniolowski's and Will Murray's), too many of the rest are not much better than the worst website Mythos fiction. Disappointing addition to amazing series."
3,Twisted ropes hassle,"We bought this despite seeing other reviewers mention what a pain it is to get this to swing straight. Indeed, our swing had cockeyed ropes permanently riveted in position, cheaply and quickly done. My husband is a professional rigger by trade (""key grip"" in the film industry) and after spending quite a while adjusting all he could- the swing is still uneven and it swings at a diagonal angle. Back to amazon it goes. I'll look for the older models of this type of swing, back when they were well made."
3,won't swing straight,"This is cute, safe, and built to last, but it will not swing straight. The four ropes that hold it up are not measured to the same length and so it swings cock-eyed. So if your baby dosen't mind sitting at an angle and swinging in some kind of oddly shaped circle then it will probably do a good job for you."
5,Fun swing for the kids,"I have several toys from Fischer-Price so I am already a believer of their products. This swing is another addition to the fun and enjoyment that my kid would attain.This is safe in that it has the seatbelt and the chair is sturdy enough. I know because I have a 2 year old baby boy that is using this swing every day. This is also easy to install, I installed it myself! (Proud mom moment)And because this swing chair has a tray, I could just feed him here. I've tried some other chairs for my eldest son a while back when he was still a toddler and those doesn't compare to this."
5,great,"We bought this for our grandchild who absolutely loves it. It is great quality. She was able to use it until she reached 40 lbs. I think she could still use it weight wise but grand child #2 loves it just as much. If we had room, we would have bought two so they could have swung together"
5,Good,"I bought this for my son's swingset for my niece when she comes over to my house. She's grown out of this baby one but there's always a friend with a baby who loves this. It's secure, easy to install on the swing set, and babies love it...well except for my son but he doesn't like anything that's not a solid ground."
5,We love this swing!,"I bought this swing when my daughter was 7 months old and have not had any issues with it. She immediately loved it. She loves to be outside and watch her surroundings. She is now 11 months old and still loves it. She is very comfortable and content in it, so much she has even fallen asleep. I have not had any safety concerns with this and it has not tipped at all. I do not allow other kids to push her though."
5,Great!,This swing is perfectly safe... Setting it up was a piece of cake and our 6 month old Loves to swing in it!
1,uneven ropes,"As some others mentioned, the uneven ropes are a pain.The crimped ropes made it impossible to even the swing.We eventually just cut the ropes and tied knots to get the desired angle for a safe ride for the child.I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
4,Good Swing,Not very good if you're trying to hang it from a tree...but works very well when hung from a porch or other level place..
5,Charlotte's first swing,"Setup was basically complete right out of the box, just a little adjustment of the ropes and the swing was ready to hang. It seems very stable and well made. Charlotte (6 1/2 months old)loves it."
1,Not a good buy....,"What a waste of money! I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and when we got the cardboard off it we found that one side of the rope was much longer than the other. It had been crimped in the wrong spot, there's no way to fix it. It also isn't long enough to hang it on any tree except maybe a small bush. Save your money for a better swing, this one's not worth it."
4,Terrific Swing!,"I first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1. He LOVED it, it was his best birthday gift. Since then, it has become our standard one-year-old gift. I've given it to dozens of children and received rave reviews every time. When a friend bought this for my son's first birthday, we were thrilled. He and his friends are now nearly four and still like to swing in it even though they have mastered the big-boy swing. My one-year-old will sit in it watching the big kids play in the garden and he is a mover - does not like to sit still at all. It is also perfect on days when the ground is too wet to crawl around (which seems like everyday lately).By the way, I read the 'upside down' post. I was concerned and tried to turn mine upside down without a child in it and the ropes are balanced that I could not turn it even empty. That family may have had defective ropes or it was installed improperly..."
1,Not safe for toddlers.,"We loved this swing last summer when my son was under 12 months old. My little guy is a peanut and I thought it would last a while, however, as he began to move around he was able to flip the swing. He was just over a year and leaned forward as far as he could and the whole thing flipped over. Needless to say we took it down immediately. We are now looking into a Step 2, 5 point harness, toddler swing."
5,Perfect swing for toddler,"This is a well made product. The 4 cables prevents flips while the ""fearless"" toddler reaches out to one side or the other. There's a seat belt that prevent the kid from crawling out, and the tray table is great for toys or outdoor feasting. At the bottom of the seat there are holes for rain water to drain out.If you have a tree branch or a horizontal beam, mounting is super easy. Just wrap the cable around it. No tools or knots necessary. If the seat doesn't look balanced, you'll have to adjust the length of the individual cables.My 12-month kid is at the exploration age, so he doesn't like to be tied up to this swing just yet. However, I'm guessing that phase will pass and he will eventually discover the joy of swinging."
5,Love it!,"My son started using this when he was 6 months old. He loves it! There are other reviews that mention that it does hang somewhat lop-sided and this is true. (About 1 inch higher on one side.) However, it hangs beautifully from a large tree in our yard. It is simple to operate with one hand and secures the child easily. Other swings did not provide the same security for the child."
4,7 month old loves it!,We got this swing so our baby boy could enjoy spending time outside with the rest of the family. We buckle him in and he starts grinning! He loves his swing so much!
3,Old School Swing: It Still Works,"I had one of these for my daughter when she was little. It took her longer than most kids to hit the minimum weight limit for it and she was still too small so she bounced around in it (scary for a little one). I rolled up towels and stuffed them around her to stabilize her and then she enjoyed it. We used it for about a year and then she'd already hit the maximum weight limit. Anyways, I ended up buying another one for my nephew because he's a big kid and I think it's handy having a swing at your house and getting your kids outside for some fresh air. For the price, it's worth it."
5,daughter love it,when friendscome over to play they love the sing and i could carry it to the park and used it
2,UNCERTAIN SO FAR,"Purchased this product as it seems it's one of those quintessential ""toys"" every kid should have like a wagon or trike. However, am somewhat disappointed that we have as of yet, been unable to set it up. The product comes with relatively short rope length that almost guarantees the need to purchase additional rope from the hardware store to hang at a decent height from a practical branch off our trees. Will let you know if my disappointment changes once I've put worth all the extra effort obviously involved with this purchase."
2,"Cute, comfy, but difficult tray","I thought I would like this swing but the tray is very difficult to get on. Whenever my son sees this he gets so excited he dives toward the swing but it takes too long to get the tray apart (two handed motion and still difficult). He is comfy and I think safe when he is in the swing, but VERY DIFFICULT to get him out."
4,Easy to set up Toddler Swing,We are overall satisfied with the swing. The only problem is that one side of the rope is longer than the other and it is permanently attached to the underneath. When using it she is slightly tilted despite us trying to adjust the ropes. She is still secure enough where we use it anyway.
3,Why $85? It's $20 elsewhere online!,"I can't figure out why this swing costs $85 here. It is available at several other sites online, including Fisher Price's site, Toys R Us, and Target, for $19.99. That's a really big price difference..."
2,Not as happy as I had hoped,"The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help. Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal. It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in. The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it. The worst part was getting her out. The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position. I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all. I'll be donating the swing."
5,As advertised....,"I wanted a simple, inexpensive swing for my 7 month old and this works perfectly. I spent another $10 on chain and hooks at the hardware store and we were good to go. It's safe and comfy..."
4,Nice Swing for the Price,"I purchased this swing to match one that I already have. My only faux-pas is that it's very hard to adjust the ropes to make them even. Other than that, two thumbs up!!!"
4,Nice Swing,"Our daughter loves to be rocked and bounced to sleep (at the same time, so the rocking chair only works part of the time). After a couple of weeks of taking turns, our knees were DONE! We got the swing hoping it would satisfy her. It actually didn't work when she was fussy and tired, BUT it works great the rest of the time. She naps in it and hangs out with her older siblings in it."
1,Poorly manufactured....,bought this swing for my son when I received that package was in good order I opened the box. One side of the ropes for the swing was longer than the other side. Once I hung the swing (had to hand with additional rope one side longer than the other the swing set up too far didn't matter which position setting I had it on. I ended up purchasing one a walmart that I should've gotten in the first place.
1,t-bar swings are better,"I had bought this swing and returned it the next day. Everyone on the block has the old model of the swing with the t-bar, and that is what I wanted. I put my son who was 7 months old in it, buckled him up, and I felt like he was going to fall out or end up dangling somehow. He had figured out how to get the stationary swing to move when it wasn't on, by moving himself forward and backward. Also fisher price thinks the snack tray is a benefit, but it really isn't. You are supposed to feed your child while they are sitting still. What if the baby chokes while they are swinging and eating? I think the directions even say not to leave your child unattended and to only have food when the swing is still."
3,Wish I had spent a little more for the Little Tikes,"I bought this for my twin grand children. They already had a Little Tikes swing. This one looked like it would be easier to get the child in and out because you just sit them down and lock the tray over their lap. In reality, it's not that hard to get their legs into the other swing. Also, it was about $10 cheaper than the Little Tikes swing. Now that the swings are side-by-side, the Little Tikes is just a better swing overall."
5,Kid loves it,"This it a great, durable, easy to install swing that my kid loves. Not gonna get much better than that! Easy to use, easy to dry off and can be left in the rain with no adverse effects. Solid swing."
3,Fisher Price Swing,The ropes were not the same length so we had to adjust the chains that we attached it to to make it level.It is a good product but nothing to be excited about.
4,"Great swing, works even for my 3-month old","This swing is sturdy, easy to install, adjusts nicely for infants, and the tray is great!My one recommendation would be to buy (or make) something soft for your baby to sit on when in the swing. Otherwise, the plastic is a bit hard on her head and she slips a bit too much. I bought the ""Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support"" (for only $12) and it fits into the swing really well."
4,the swing was great,The Fisher Price swing worked really well for our 8 month old granddaughter. She fits in it well and really enjoys swinging.
4,Great swing,I bought this for my 6 month old grandson. He loves swinging in it. I love the way it reclines for infants and able to set up for toddlers.
1,Uneven ropes that are way too short anyway!,"I'm sure this swing would be just fine if the ropes are not different lengths. And if you have a very short tree. Very short. :)The swing we received has ropes that are two [very] different lengths, and like previous reviewers mentioned, they are crimped so that they cannot be fixed. Also, as I mentioned, your tree branch would have to be VERY low to the ground for this swing to work at all. Perhaps it is meant more for use on play swing set structures, but I have seen many of these swings (or similar ones) hanging from trees in my neighborhood, so I assumed it would work. Should not have assumed, obviously. Good luck!"
4,Great Baby swing,"The item was purchased for my grandson, he doesn't like swinging in it just yet, he enjoys being off the ground to watch the traffic and people watch."
3,Kids love it!!!,"I have 4 nieces and nephews using these two swings I bought. They love them. The only issue I have had is they hang very low when put on a regular swing set. When flipped over to shorten, they hang crooked. But nothing we can't live with. They are loving using them and I like the buckle and tray for the smaller kids."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SAFE! I recently purchased this swing for my 6 month old son. It looked safe enough at first glance, however it is not stable, even when used with a swing set that provides an even and balanced support surface. My 6 year old daughter was gently swinging my son (under parental supervision thank goodness) when he leaned back, suddenly tipping the swing UPSIDE DOWN! Had I not been standing right there my son would have fallen several feet to the ground as there are no shoulder harnesses for this swing. I can assure you that this swing was installed properly by their every safety direction, but still failed miserably to perform as it should. PLEASE DO NOT BUY this swing! Look for one that utilizes the shoulder harness feature at least."
5,This swing lasted through two grandchildren!,"This swing was one of the best investments we ever made. My two grandchildren literally spent hundreds of hours out in our backyard. We hung this swing from a tree, and both children used it long after the recommended age of three. This swing held up in weather--through rain, snow, and sun. It was very durable and proved to be quite safe. Of course, adults were usually pushing the swing. I would recommend this swing very highly!Carolyn Woodul"
4,wyatt new swing,"My grandson Wyatt now 9 months old, loves his new swing. The swing seems to be really safe for little ones. The only thing is that it is a little difficult to remove the tray to get him out, however since it seems to be so safe and very cute design we can deal with this little problem. We took pictures of him in his new swing and he was really smiling."
4,This is a great swing!,"We love this swing! So does 6 month old Jake! He sits in it and just swings away! When his average size 3 year old cousin came over, she decided she wanted to swing, so her older cousins helped her in it and pushed her back and forth and she loved it! The swing has held up very well! The only thing that is kind of difficult about this is getting the yellow part off to get an older and bigger child out. This is probably a good thing, though, so that a child cannot fall out. We have it attached to our back porch. Swinging in this has provided lots of smiles from our little boy!"
3,Be Careful,"We just bought this swing for our ten month old daughter. I put her in it, buckled her up (no shoulder straps) and she liked it for a minute, then began to cry. She leaned forward to reach for me to get her out, when she did, the left side of the waist belt CAME OUT OF THE SWING! Had I not been right in front of her to catch her she would have tumbled right onto the ground. The straps are the kind that you fold the end in half, push it through the back of the swing and then flatten it back out and that's how it's held in place. There are no kind of metal pieces to ensure the strap doesn't work its way back through. So, not sure how safe this swing is going to be. I don't know if all infant swings are made this way, just be careful."
1,Didn't work for us,"I bought this swing for my 10 month old. Even though she loves swings we used this one only 2 times. First of all, if your child is more on a chubby side, it will be very hard to put her in or take her out of the swing. Also, there is someting sharp under the little tray. I still can't find what it is, but when I picked my daughter out of the swing, something scratched her and now she is afraid to come even close to it. Maybe we just had bad luck, but we are definitly not going to use this one."
2,Very Concerned Parent,"My husband and I purchased this swing for our 14 month old daughter. At first we liked it, but yesterday we changed our minds. Our daughter can unbuckle the belt. We are very concerned about this. If she can do it what is stopping an older child from doing this and getting hurt. Thank God my husband was standing there or she may have fallen out. I called the company and they said they would refund our money after they got the swing. Please if you own this swing, don't leave your child alone. I am hoping Fisher Price will recall it and do something about this problem. We are going out this weekend and look for a new swing. Please Please watch your kids. I am hoping the company does something about this problem before someone gets hurt. Let the company know how you feel or if you have a problem of any kind let them know. I'm sure they will do all they can to help."
4,Scientists debunking pseudo-science...,"If you're unclear why serious scientists get so frustrated with the intelligent-design movement, then this book is a must-read. It offers the opinions of respected professionals from a variety of fields, from biology to psychology, all of whom have one thing in common: they recognize that while science and evolutionary theory have not answered every question in the universe, intelligent design has not answered any. Another common theme throughout is the debunking of ""teach the controversy"", touted by intelligent designers as a back-door means of getting religious belief taught in the classroom. As these insightful authors explain, the only ""controversy"" is the misappropriation and distortion by intelligent-design proponents of evidence produced by serious researchers to satisfy the former group's untenable claims. There's nothing scientific about that..."
5,It's about time,"It's about time scientists are publishing scientific analyses of the 'science' and arguments being presented by the Intelligent Design Movement. Particularly notworthy is Steven Pinker's essay on ""Evolution and Ethics"" pp 142-152, which presents the view that evolution includes a built-in ethical and moral base."
3,Good for beginners but not enough for 70-228 exam,"This is a well organized and relatively well-written book. It is very good for beginners who have little or no prior experiences in this field. However, this book alone is not able to get you pass 70-228. If you understand and remember every word of it, you may get 500 (passing score is 755 out of 1000). After this book, a natural next step is Transcender, which has the right difficult level for the exam but too hard for a beginner."
1,Terrible book,"The first four chapters are full of examples and exercises, but don't explain how to install and configure the software. Why would installation be relegated to the fifth chapter? This book totally left me on my own to get SQL Server 2000 installed and configured so I could follow the first four chapters. In fact, I'm not even sure what the the first four chapters are for since most of it is repeated in more detail in the later chapters. Also, it's full of typing errors. Some of the intended deletions and corrections are actually still included in the text. It's very easy to see that there wasn't much effort put into this book. It's poorly organized and edited. Not only are some of the answers wrong, but in some cases the information completely contradicts itself. I've read several certification books from many different publishers, so I believe I have a good idea of what a well written book is, and this isn't a well written book. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone."
5,Excellent book,The content is nicely presented. Real life problems are discussed in detail. Administration tasks are covered with practical examples. Overall a good book to refer for exam 70-228.
2,Needs Improvement,If you are new to SQL server and want to know the basics of the application then this books if your you. If you want to pass the exam however then I suggest you look else where. The material is too simplistic and there are too much typo errors. I read the book twice before turning to other materials like the Transcenders and Self Test software and I must say had it not been for the other materials that I used I would have failed the exam.
1,Because zero stars isn't an option,"This book is terrible. Period. The writing is dry, probably only 25% of the material is applicable to the exam itself, and the book is filled with inaccuracies. I sincerely doubt the author even took the 70-228 exam before writing this book, ... A complete waste of money, avoid this book like the plague."
1,Can't compete with many other better books,"There are better books to buy.This book is too simplisitic to be of much help with the exam. It needs editting, index is useless, there are lots of blatant errors, etc. A year or two ago maybe there weren't many alternatives, but now I'd recommend the Microsoft ""Training Kit"" book as much better, or additionally ""Inside Sql Server 2000"" for reference. For example test questions, the Microsoft ""Readiness Review"" is more realistic (albeit very brief), or spend the $$ for Transcender, etc."
4,"more than one line, many views","This is a tentet, larger than a combo smaller than the full orchestra he used on the earlier Black Saint classics ""Blu Blu Blu"" and ""Hearinga Suite"". Abrams uses a large sonic pallette including harp, accordion and violin in addtion to standard reeds/brass to explore a variety of group texture, tone colour and space. Some quieter tracks ""Hyperdepth"" and the title cut seem developmental, scored material mixed with open, abstract improvisations, others deploy complex charts featuring individual solos like the rhyhmically powerful compositions ""11 over 4"" and ""The Prism 3"", drummer Reggie Nicholson's seething cross rhythms cook on this one.the last cut ""Ensemble Song"" is collective improv + text ending on a earthy piano/trumpet duet over a basic blues. Another fine disc by a contemporary master composer player."
5,emperor francis joseph,"have actually not been able to start reading but know by title, will be great. thanks."
4,What a great ending to a great series,"I have enjoyed this series very much. Many of the stories, I have read more than once. This and the Presidential Agent Series are my two favorites."
3,stiff and flat,"I give this book 3 stars in comparison to other Austen fan fiction, not as it relates to the book population as a whole. It is not a very good book, but it did not make me cringe or exclaim out loud as others in this genre have made me do. It wasn't painful.But...it was very stiff and without spirit. It's about half the length of P&P;, and it shows in that it feels like it is just moving from one event to the next...check, check, check. The period of time between Elizabeth rejecting Darcy at Rosings to his seeing her on the grounds of Pemberley are covered in a measly 10 pages - this is the time that Darcy changes from the man Elizabeth rejects to the man she loves, and it's covered in a heartbeat. The book is just going through the motions, but not expanding on what Darcy is thinking or feeling. It is hard to see how he fell in love with her in the first place from reading this book; he's just in love because he has to be to keep moving through the scenes in P&P;."
2,The Confession of Fitzwilliam Darcy,This was a narrative from Darcy's point of view and was it was not well done. I have read better P&P variations from Darcy's point of view. The story dragged and was not that interesting.
2,Meh version of Darcy's perspective,"Pride and Prejudice retold through the eyes of Mr. Darcy. I love seeing what other authors will do when it comes to Mr. Darcy.The beginning was a bit slow and Darcy was pretty boring and broodish and arrogant. But by the middle it was starting to get pretty good. I liked hearing his thoughts, but I thought she rushed the book a bit and left out details I would have liked to known. She just gave brief summaries of what he was doing when he wasn't with Elizabeth...so I would've liked to have seen and heard and experienced what he was doing. That's why I really enjoyed the Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman Series by Pamela Aidan."
2,Bad Misprint,"I was really excited to read Darcy's viewpoint, but then realized that the last 3 chapters of the book were a repeat of chapters 11, 12, and 13. So, I couldn't even finish the book. I really liked what I read up to, but was so disappointed to find that the book was a bad misprint."
3,Great book but how does it end?,The copy I had was wonderful until page 234 at which point it ended mid-conversation and jumped back to chapter 14. I am missing the end of the book. I will be returning it but it was very irritating since I was so engrossed.
1,Don't bother!,"Basically an awful retelling of Pride and Prejudice with hardly anything new to add, and definitely nothing new of consequence or interest to add. Not worth reading."
4,ONE OF THE BETTER ONES....,"This would rate as one of the better ""sequels."" Interesting insight of Darcy's attitude and opinions, especially regarding his famous encounters with Elizabeth.Very quick read, perhaps predictable in some areas, but overall one the the better ones. I would keep this one."
5,One of the more enjoyable Darcy views,"I read this almost at the same time asThe Diary of Henry Fitzwilliam Darcyand I really enjoyed them both. Someone complained that it seemed more like a porn? Not as I remember it, and I just read it last week. I don't remember lots of graphic details that were offensive. It is so much better than some of the newer books that are in print, that I gave it 5 stars. I like it when an author stays within the framework of the story and the characters, but covers new ground our fleshes in details. When it's just a re-hash of the original, then why not re-read the original? If you can find this book for less than $30 (yikes! for a paper back, are you kidding me??) then I think you will be pleased you gave it a shot."
3,"Darcy's point of view, does not deviate from P&P","This P&P; variation is the retelling of the story from Darcy's point of view. This book does not deviate from P&P; but does not enhance it either. ""Confessions"" reminds me of a similar work called ""Darcy's Story"" which also re-told P&P; from Darcy's point of view without giving the reader anything more than what you can read in the text of P&P.; I rate this book slightly better than ""Darcy's Story"" because it is a little more interesting. I much prefer Aibgail Reynolds' books. Reynold's Pride and Prejudice vatiations all adds color and personality depth, each slightly different (true to the theme of variations) and yet Reynolds also remains true to the text and language of P&P.;""Confessions"" is a nice read with a cup of tea on a winter afternoon. A little flat, but soothing and readable."
4,Confessions of a spin-off junky:,"Granted I had just read two VERY POORLY written P&P spin-offs shortly before reading this one...therfore; my review may be slightly colored. Yet, I declare it was pleasantly mild and entertaining. It will not suit those searching for the steamy details of a true-love marriage, and it will not sate the appetites of those who feel the need to find some psychological or sociological deviance in the beloved characters... which may be exactly WHY it provided such a breath of fresh air for me. It was a quick and enjoyable extension of a story I love. The characters were not perfectly upheld (who but Jane herself could truly do them justice?), and there was not much of climax to the story. But a nice visit with old ""friends"" in a style that was not unpleasant to read. Best of all this is truly an extension of the book, not one of the movies (especially the K.Knightly version which is hardly a true retelling in itself)."
3,Adequate - but no P&P,"The author makes a good attempt at retelling the P&P story from a different point of view. The pacing was a bit slow, however. There was some repetition of ideas, giving a ""disjointed"" effect. It was almost like some passages were added late in the writing process, and they did not flow from one idea to another very well."
2,Jane Austen Lovers Think Carefully,"This was an unimaginative book, which just rearranges many of Austen's memorable lines. Somewhat boring, even for Darcy fans."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!,"It would be great if you had negative stars for this one. My daughter and I were starting to work on her hair and she opened the package and no sooner than she poured the dry packet into the bottle did she started coughing constantly. I walked over and experienced the same coughing. We mixed the product to completion, thinking this might help, but that made it worse. There were the most amazingly potent fumes coming from this. I told her to get rid of it.Clairol Xtreme FX XtremeFX Bleach-Out Tool Kit 1 eaWe both went to bed with a headache. This is without a doubt the most toxic hair experience I have ever encountered. It was ridiculous!!! I still don't feel right this morning and neither does my daughter. I feel like my lungs have been ravaged. If you value your health....stay away from this product. It was the worst experience."
3,Hair looks like an old carpet indoors,"I am a younger man, 21, who wants yellow hair in the summer. I have medium brunnette hair. I have used Xtreme FX twice. The first time, I didn't leave it in long enough and my hair turned out bright orange and only began to look cool when it grew long and you could see the roots. This time I divided the ingredients in half and bleached twice, each time leaving it on for over an hour and using heat from a hair dryer to speed up the process. It looks fairly ""Eminem"" in the sun, which is what I want. However, indoors at home under tungsten light it looks like an old nicotine-stained white carpet-- like an acrylic stuffed animal's fur or something. Maybe it works well for lighter hair or if you leave out some of the tint vial, but I believe I have gone as far as I can with this product and will try something else next time."
1,Free money for college,"Even though this book has a high rating, the book is only good for a starting a fire. I was unable to many grants for college that did not have some sort of requirements."
3,The Appeal is in the Subject Matter,"This book is appealing to stitchers, but not so much for real mystery fans. It's a passable book, not totally predictable, but in some areas seems a bit forced. Still, as big fan of needlework, it's always exciting for me to read about it, particularly to see it combined with a cozy mystery."
1,Highly Academic. Highly Acclaimed. Little value.,"The Strategy Paradox is a waste of your money and time! I do not know why this book has received such popular acclaim. Michael Raynor is extremely ""academic"" and seems to possess little knowledge of the real business world. He repeatedly misuses words in the English language, including ""profound"", ""robust"", and ""ecosystem"". Raynor attempts to impress his readers by talking about quantum physics, game theory, and natural selection but instead he confuses them. Raynor seems to write with an air of authority that few people could have about the subject, and than concludes the book with a philosophical lesson on the value of ""humility"". Raynor, take your own advice!"
5,Birth of a Classic,"The Strategy Paradox is one of the most useful analyses of business success in the last decade. It is not a quick or simplistic set of secrets to success, followed by a one-size-fits-all, 7 step implementation plan. Instead, it starts with a careful analysis of both business successes and failures, then demonstrates how the challenge of making strategic commitments in the face of uncertainty can be managed effectively. Raynor's description of strategic flexibility provides one of the most useful approaches to integrating scenario planning and real option portfolio management to create a customized, flexible and difficult to copy strategy for success. Rich with examples from his research, and supplemented with extensive, explanatory footnotes, Raynor has created what will certainly become a classic."
4,A Contrary View of Strategy,"In The Strategy Paradox, Deloitte Consultant Michael Raynor makes the argument that the greater the strategic bet an organization makes, the greater the risk. Raynor promotes a mindset for managing strategic uncertainty based on calculated risk. He suggests that companies should develop several viable strategies, moving to the one that is most practical in a given market. Further, he asserts that the future is now, and companies must adapt their strategies to take advantage of specific market opportunities.This work is provocative in that it challenges the conventional wisdom about strategy. While the book has an academic bent at times and drags on a bit, it is based on a valid premise and solid research."
2,Didn't work for me,"I got this to help with my depression after reading the great reviews and was surprised, strangely it worsen my mood instead of improving it."
5,Bb Best fake Book Ever,Good resource. I use it in small group performance. The tunes of a more recent era of jazz and very playable.
3,Maybe not that great for trumpet...,"I'm just getting started playing the trumpet again after a 48 yr. break. I bought this book because of the large number of songs and being written in b flat. True there are a lot of songs that are newer and not so many standard ""oldies"". However, that's not my main concern. A lot of songs just don't sound that good on the trumpet and some are written with notes so low that they sound terrible. There are some great trumpet pieces such as ""When Sunny Gets Blue"", ""Misty"", etc., but you have to wade through a lot of others to get to the good ones. I have some other Leonard fake books for the keyboard and they are just fine but look for some other music for the trumpet."
5,MODERN FROM THE 70s,"Great fun if you like modern music from the 2d half of the 20th century. It is energetic, thoughtful, scary, funny, and surprising. I was a student of Bubalo's and it was great to hear developed versions of ideas he shared with us 40 years ago."
2,Misleading title,"I hoped to gain some knowledge from an ""encyclopedia"", but after looking at this title I just learned that Russia has good knife craftsmen and a trade guild. This book is a full color catalog of some knife makers, there is no discernible reason on why the companies or makers were selected. There are probably over 900 knives portrayed with limited descriptions and maker details, you might be able to get some bits from practical information after reading all of it, but is not easy to read a over 400 pages catalog."
4,A gift for my mother,She seemed to really like it. I saw what she did with it and it seems to work in showing where everything goes in creating your own house that some day you may want to have all your own.
1,Not worth the price of a stamp,I bought this kit for my daughter's ten year birthday. It is nothing but a box full of large cardstock printed with brick and siding. There is nothing to show you how to draw anything from scale. This is NOT a toy or intended to be used by children; it is primarily for adults who already have professional floorplans and wish to build a model.
2,IT'S MADE OF PAPER,"I DON'T GET IT! I COULD BUY THICK PAPER AT THE STORE WITH PATTERNS ON IT! THAT'S ALL IT IS. IT CERTAINLY IS NOT AN ARCHITECTURAL TOOL, EVEN BASIC ENOUGH FOR KIDS."
4,Informative and Exceptional,"In his well-written work on the native trout of the American West, Dr. Behnke provides readers with a priceless resource. He gives the proper historical and biological information when neeed and the book will please all fishermen, naturalists, and anyone interested in the West. A great book."
4,Bratz I-Candy: Phoebe,"I don't have the I Candy Bratz but I want them. I might buy them because they are only ten dollars each. That's a great price for a Bratz, and I don't care that they only have one outfit.Phoebe is one of the Twiins. Roxxi is her Twiin. In this set, Phoebe has long dark red/brown hair and green eyes. Her hair has light green streaks.She wears a black shirt, green skirt, and green shoes. The shoes and feet snap on n' off.The only problem is that her legs are painted black! Why can't she just wear black tights? If she did, her friends could wear the shoes, but they are black also!They only made three dolls in this set: Phoebe, Cloe, and Yasmin. Why is Cloe in EVERY set? None of the others are! I am sort of tired of so many Cloes. They should make at least one set without her. Jade and Sasha are not in this set, but I think they should be. Jade is my favorite Bratz!"
2,oh my,"When the first editon Twiinz: Phoebe and Roxxi came out, Phoebe was my favorite. But then, when i saw this doll, i quickly changed my mind. This is..really really bad looking. Not only is she cheap looking, but her hair also gets terribly matted. The outfits are ugly, and the green makes me sick. Sorry, but this, and the other I Candy dolls, have got to go! If you want a good Phoebe doll, you may have to wait a while because even Campfire Phoebe isn't that great. You don't have to listen to me, but thats my opinion. If you want a kind of *cute* - *girly* doll, try one from the Ooh La La collection. Those are perfect."
2,Oh No!!,"No, no, no! I totally like that they continued Phoebe and Roxxi on by themselves, but this doll sort of looks like not such a good thing; the clothes are cool but here's my one complaint: ""Why on Earth did they paint the legs and feet in the shoes black?"" It really takes away from the beauty and quality of this doll if you ask me. This doll could easily have a five star rating if it wasn't for those legs that look like wetsuit pants!~KAZAMI AMI"
2,A little better than the others,"I think the I candy dolls are soooooooo ugly,but this one can be better than them.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
3,shedding,our pug sheds terrible. thls lotion and shampoo helps stop the shedding. not all but it stops some of it.
1,Furminator deshedding formula shampoo,"I am not pleased that I received this product. It seems that Amazon.com just could not let me get by with ordering just the Fuminator and not the addition of shampoo. I guess I was just not paying enough money. I am not a professional groomer and could never bathe a cat. The Furminator I wanted but not the shampoo. If I had sent back the shampoo, I would have had to pay for shipping which is about the same as the product itself. Maybe I did not order correctly. I will take the cat to be professionally groomed and use the product at that time."
3,Helped with extreme matting,Used this product along with furminator comb. Together it took care of some matting problem with my cat. It is pricey and I am uncertain if it did a better job than less expensive brands...but it did work.
5,Country-Metal-Rap,"When I saw Travis Shredd and the Good 'Ol Homeboys live, I was blown away by their technical virtuosity. Country, Metal and Rap seem like the least likely bedfellows, however Travis pulls them together with tongue firmly planted in cheek. These guys know country, metal, and rap well enough to effectively parody all three genres. In addition, the CD is masterfully recorded and produced. Unfortunately, TSGOH are no longer together, but pick up this CD if you like genre parodies."
3,"BEWARE!!!! You only get 1, NOT 4",I bought this thinking I was going to actually get 4 pens. The picture is very deceiving. This price is for 1 pen only NOT 4 and you don't get to choose the color. It's a good pen I can't deny that....
3,Item description misleading,"I have previously owned a Xenon pen and LOVED it. But, it has been long since lost. When I came across this item I was very excited as it appeared to be pink in color like my previous pen. However, when I received it today the pen is not pink but rather red. Needless to say, I am disappointed since I didn't receive what I expected. I will keep it. But, going forward I will make a mental note that ""Lava"" is red not pink."
3,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this thinking that I was buying a set of pens, instead, I only received one. The photograph is deceiving."
3,A nice selection of read-aloud stories,"This glossy-paged book contains fourteen stories about monsters and giants, written by a variety of authors from the Grimm brothers to Oscar Wilde. Some of the stories will likely be familiar to you, such as Beauty and the Beast or Jack and the Beanstalk. But most are more obscure, including some traditional folk tales from Ireland, Scotland, and China.The black and white illustrations are very well done, and interspersed with the text in an interesting way. Children will enjoy the language, which is generally playful and fun. The older stories have been updated so that the dialogue doesn't seem antiquated, and yet they are faithful to their sources."
4,Good but Complex,"Unfortunately I have not finished the book yet due to time constraints, but I have completed the first few chapters. It is a complicated book that requires attention to detail and some discussion. I am a atmospheric scientists so the type of writing found is this book is new to me and required 100% concentration. Discussing the book with a group was essential for clarifying some points the author had. I don't feel knowledgeable enough in this field to comment on the validity of the paper, I'll leave that to the professionals."
2,It only takes a French accent...,"Anglophone readers probably don't realise that Latour meant this book as a tongue-in-cheek exercise to capture the postmodern social theory market in his own country by using a postmodern style to show what an illusion postmodernism has always been. But, as fate would have it, when someone sneezes in Paris, an Anglophone is felled with pneumonia. It's hard to believe that anyone with a firm grasp of the history of the last 250 years of Western culture would find this book anything more than a diversion worthy of maybe a couple of arguments in the pub. It's telling that historians of science, who are really the people who are in a position to hold Latour accountable to anything he says here, have given the book a chilly reception. Classify this one under 'Pseud's Corner'."
4,Recommended,"This book has helped me in successfully carrying out an assignmemt for college work. I will recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning or understanding the baptist religion. Kenneth Anthony Lum explains the religion in topic form and very vividly, so there can be no problem in understanding what is read."
3,Could have been more better,"I read most of the online reviews for this book at Amazon and decided to purchase the book. Unfortunately, this book is not upto my expectation. I found two drawbacks for this book.1. Many language constructs are used in the examples before they are described fully. For ex, the example on page 78 uses the synchronized keyword all of a sudden but it is explained at page 99 and page 278. This makes it somewhat difficult to follow.2. The code listings are given for the example, but the output results are not given for most of the examples.Thanks,Balaji."
3,catholic social teaching,"A good book for learning the current party line on Catholic social teaching. It is well organized and connects the Vatican documents to the social teaching. Very biased against liberation theology and the author has a hard time explaining the difference between social justice teaching and the traditional teaching of charity. However, the book helped me a lot while I was teaching a class on the social teachings of the Catholic Church."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"This case is a complete waste of time, its way to flimsy to protect from any kind of falling damage. The lid rarely stays closed. And thier is virtually zero pading on the inside. I dropped it empty from 5 feet and one side of the case actually bent. And to top it off, its ridicuasly overpriced, its not even worth 10 dollars.THis case is craptacular waste of money, completey worthless."
3,Pretty cool,"This is pretty cool. My daughter loves it, it makes her room all awesome looking, very disco chic. These types of decorations are all the rage among her friends so it was recieved very well. My only problem with it is the lightbulb burned out after 4 hours use. They are easy to replace though and I plan to replace it soon."
1,"small, light did not work, but nice and easy return. Thanks","The item is very small, the light did not work. It's more a toy than a lamp. The return was very easy, fast and with no hassle. Thankd"
3,Okay for a starter,This item looks a lot bigger in the picture but in reality is roughly the size of an orange. It still has the nice effect of lighting up a dark room the way a disco ball is supposed to but not in the fashion which my daughters larger one did. We still liked the product because for its size it did remarkably well and it was a good deal for its size but if you truly want a more fantastic display i'd say go for the bigger ones unless this is all you can afford.
3,GrownUpMusic.com Recommended!,"Singer-songwriter John Wesley Harding has picked up the musical mantle abandoned by Elvis Costello: that of poet laureate for the small sect of listeners who still crave a little wit, wisdom and originality in their straight-on rock and pop. He even sounds like Costello a bit, by way of Jakob Dylan. We love ""Negative Love."" Infectious beat, catchy melody, smart lyrics (""Negative Love, the radio's playing my request. Negative love, you lie before me unimpressed. Why say yes. When you know all the ways to say no best.""). Harding is a tunesmith worthy of our adulation. He's like the clever friend who effortlessly tosses out the witty barb with perfect timing. His wry humor, paired with an uncanny sense of melody, make this disc a total pleasure."
2,Disappointed in Trimec Plus versus plain Trimec,"Very Disappointing! I have used regular Trimec many times over the years and it killed the dandelions, crab grass, clover etc very very well. However I was sold the Trimec Plus by mistake and I didn't notice the difference until I had it opened and ready to use. Unfortunately even though I use this product at the same time of year I used the regular Trimec but the PLUS did not perform well at all and I will need to redo the application."
1,Didn't work at all,"The local feed & seed recommended this as a generic version of Round Up, saying that in about three days all my weeds would be gone and my Bermuda grass would be able to take over. 4 days later not a single weed or other grass shows any signs of damage. I re-applied at a stronger concentration (3 oz/gallon) and still nothing after a week."
2,A disappointment!,"This book wanders all over the place, has too many stories, and not enough concrete suggestions. There are definitely better books on the topic of women and anger."
4,diamond in rough,"The conductor may be no Raymond Leppard, but he's preferable by a great stretch than some of these other ""new baroque"" recordings out there where everything is a forte marcato allegretto. He maintains the baroque atmosphere, much like Harnoncourt's sound (is this he? I don't know who the conductor is). The chorus also has the baroque sound, but my goodness! Thank God for a chorus with proper vowels and a nice sound! Much better than some Deutsche Grammaphon choruses I've heard. If you like the Monteverdi Choir with Gardiner, you'd probably like this chorus as well (I myself am a choister and soloist specializing in oratorio and other such sacred music)."
4,An occasional Haendel.,The enclosed booklet is too poor. The singers are only good (the best is the soprano). Only good also the conductor . In this way this Haendel's work seems a minor one. Is really so?
2,YUCK!,They taste good at first...the seasoning is ok but the actual cracker is horrible. The after taste is gross. I went through about 4 boxes of these and became sick of them. Won't be eating the rest.
4,Great session...more then just sex focused,This is a great yoga session (approx 50 min) to help you be more flexible and energetic. The instructor is innovative with poses and he explains well. You need to watch it once before doing it...he goes a bit fast. 3 guys are doing the poses with the instructor helping them.Production value (sound quality/scene framing) is bit cheap...it feels like a one take session but it's not that important.
2,Low Grade Video Quality,"This video both sounded and looked very amature. The sound had a lot of echo, definitely not created in a studio. At one point you could even hear someone talking out in the hall. The video quality looks like it was shot with a for home vhs video camera. The editing was also poor. This reminded me of a home made video. Most of the workout was very easy and basic, with two difficult moves thrown in. I'm glad I got this video first, because if the rest of his videos are as low quality as this one, I wouldn't want to waste my money. He does speak very fast throughout the video. And if you are looking for at least a hot guy to watch working out, you won't find him on here. If you're serious about some good yoga workouts that are worth doing, I highly recommend Bryan Kest Power Yoga first and Baron Baptiste second."
4,"do not have much of a sex life but at least i can bend over backwards now, if that day ever comes","after being in a car wreck i lost alot of flexability, and strengh, this dvd is very good, some times a touch boring but gets the job done"
2,Tepid Boogaloo Joe,"The way to go with Boogaloo Joe is to buy the Legends of Acid Jazz Vol. 1 compilation. That stuff is smokin'. This one has its moments, but is uniformly less fun than the Legends compilation. Some of the cover versions of then/formerly-popular songs are dangerously close to elevator music (especially ""He's So Fine"" & ""My Love""). Also, a couple of the slow ones get way too slow for this kind of thing. ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" a great (& slow) Roberta Flack song, seems interminable. Don't be fooled by the album & song titles, which look a whole lot cooler than it sounds."
4,Good Beginner book and quick reference for Intermediate user,"This is a great book as Word has changed. I like the 2007 version of Word. This lets you know how to do quick overal page and margin set up, widows and orphans, and stuff you need once in a while; but do not use daily. Good for the novice and Intermediate user who does not know where to change items not used on a daily basis-- Definitely worth the money."
3,Good but not great,Being new to the Wumpscut sound I did not know what to expect. I found this to be enjoyable and properly doom laden but the insistance on large portions of the the albun not being in english distracted me throughout. The song I WANT YOU is a hirlarious discourse on sexual relationships in this era.
2,"More of the same, and yet, somehow, less than before...","I am very disappointed by this album, as it lacks the musical strength of previous efforts, instead relying on a pathetic attempt to sound 'evil' by talking about killing and battering women. The song 'Witches Dance' sounds like a Leatherstrip demo from the 80's. This album is a perfect example of why people are sick of Industrial music; it is cliched, boring, and totally lacking any imagination. There is only so much one can do without evolving before becoming redundant. Wumpscut is obsolete. If he were to make an effort to build on what he has accomplished then it would mean something again and be a step in the right direction. This album is not it. Look for 'Black Light Twilight' or 'Faith In Motion' by INDEX, instead."
4,A good compilation,"This cd is really good, actually better than I expected. I like all of the tracks, but 'Outside' is an exceptionally beautiful piece, and 'escape'. 'Deadmaker' was not as good as I thought it would be, I thought it would be a very exciting, different song, but instead it is repetitive, but NOT as repetitive as 'witches' dance'. I like that song to an extent, but you don't want to listen to the whole thing... It gets old fast. 'I want you', despite the porno audio clip, is a brilliant song. I love it, maybe the clip is just proving the 'maturity' in Rudy's genius."
4,"This is a half step forward, but not a step back..","If you are a Wumpscut regular, you know that some of his critical peaks were Embroydead and MFAST. This however, seems to be new - fresh, but not the truely 100% dark, evil, & morbid creations and manipulations that Rudy has created in the past. No.. this CD presents somewhat of a softer side, but still has the darkwave twist. Songs such as ""Escape"" and ""Wulf"" certainly dug at the death/murder subject, but didn't quite reach the level that Soylent Green, Thorns, or Golgotha (other songs) ever sparked at."
2,Rudy in a creative crisis?,"This definitely is the weakest :Wumpscut: record so far. His previous output Embryodead like Eevil Young Flesh did not revolutionize EBM, but at least it was heavy, evil and violent. EYF is none of this. The lyrics (like always) are placative, the groove is poor and the ballad ""Sag es jetzt"" causes pain in my ears because of the gothic-like female vocals and the far too simple music. But there are some (yet few) really good songs on the CD, like ""Flucht"" and ""Zerstoerte Traeume"", which I am sure will be played in EBM-Clubs regularly. But the new :W: definitely lacks the aggressiveness, the groove and the ability to create a gloomy atmosphere which he had in former times. And there is absolutely NOTHING on this record which we haven't heard on other records earlier. Remember, Rudy: Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben."
2,one long gripe,"Sometimes, after a rough day at work, it's nice to come home to your spouse and just gripe about all the idiots that flushed your day down the toilet. That's what this book reads like; one long, nine-year complaint. If this guy was my husband and I had to listen to this garbage at the end of every day, it would be nearly impossible not to tell him to suck it up and just work like everybody else has to. Any chance at humor is overwhelmed by his negative attitude and abundant use of profanity. Halpin should have left this as a personal journal tucked in his sock drawer."
3,Talent and Tedium,"In Our Lifetime, which was recorded in 1995, was meant as something of a tribute to Booker Little. The band comprises Douglas on trumpet, Chris Speed on tenor sax and clarinet, Joshua Roseman on trombone, Uri Caine on piano, James Genus on bass, and Joey Baron on drums. Although I tried--I really did, I really tried--to get to like this recording, I found it for the large part quite tedious. There were some interesting moments, but it sounded for the most part overly earnest and overly busy, with drummer Baron especially overplaying his part. Your mileage may vary."
1,Worst TV Ever,"This is the worst excuse for a tv I have ever seen. We are served by 9 stations and it will only just barely pick up the strongest which has a million watts and is only 30 miles away. You can barely see the picture and the sound is worse. The radio will only pick up a few strong local stations, but it really doesn't matter much because the sound is too bad to listen to any of them. I thought maybe it would be a decent door stop but due to not much inside it is too light for that. Then I thought maybe a paperweight. No, takes up too much desk space. Now I have finally come up with a use for it. Target practice. A direct hit from a 357 magnum would not render it any more usless than it already is."
1,Too religious.,"This book was so religious that it was suffocating. Knowing what God wants is grand, but it doesn't help me heal. I felt there should have been some indication of this on the cover so I could have not purchased it."
5,Phenomenal book,Everyone can benefit from this book. It gives valuable insights into how we've become what we've become - both the good and the bad. Understanding empowers people to move on and look forward.
3,book purchas,I got the book in a timely manner. I was anxious for the book to get to me so it seemed to be a long time. The book is in a good condition but it does have a musty smell. It would be nice if you noted that in future sales. That way if someone has allergies they will know to take caution. Thank you for your time.
3,Overall a good book,"This book is definitely helpful in many ways to make sense of the dysfunctional relationships in a family due to mental illness or alcoholism. It helped me a lot to deal with my dad's alcoholism and my mom's mental illness, I read it while I was going to therapy as well. However - I do not understand the need of most of these sort of books to include religion. Wish I could find one that doesn't. Not everyone needs religion in order to overcome."
4,Best of 5,"In my search for an authentic British tea recipe book, I've been mostly disappointed; however, this last book I purchased was one of the exceptions. Though the author is American, he did his research, scouring the land for good tea rooms and sharing some of their recipes. He does a splendid job of transporting you there and the recipes are many and authentically British.There are several typos (e.g., a recipe for raspberry tart lists strawberries as the ingredient rather than raspberries), which is odd considering this is the latest of many editions, and it bothered me that though there were lots of appealing photos of desserts, few of them were of the actual recipes. But these are relatively minor points compared to the other books that I've so far purchased.Another good book is the Ritz tea book"
2,Disappointing!,"We are getting ready to open the tea room in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I assumed this book would be helpfull but its was not. Lots of recipes were not accurate, missing steps and ingridients, the photos are nice, but they do not match the recipes. Very disappointing!Olga Cannon."
5,You can almost smell the tea brewing and the scones baking!,"The Great Tea Rooms of Britain is a beautiful coffee (or tea) table edition compiling scrumptious descriptions and color photographs of twenty-two of Britain's finest tea rooms. Along with some detailed history, each chapter suggests several walking tours or short drives nearby that will round out the tea itinerary quite nicely. Locations include London, Scotland, Bath, the Lake district, and more. A handy list of tea room addresses, web sites and phone numbers will help the visitor to plan ahead and make reservations where necessary. Last but not least, a lovely collection of recipes completes the book, with measurements adapted to American standard usage. Whether the reader is a determined, experienced traveler or an armchair dreamer, The Great Tea Rooms of Britain is sure to enchant and enrich. You can almost smell the tea brewing and the scones baking!Nancy LorraineReviewer"
5,A Great and insightful beautiful book,I am new to the love of the history of tea. I ordered this book not only because I wanted to learn more about tea but because we are planning a trip to Ireland this spring. I know Ireland is famous for its pubs but I wanted to see if they also have some great tea houses. this book is a beautiful coffee table style book with gorgeous pictures and interesting facts.The Great Tea Rooms of BritainI have Great Tea Rooms of America on my wishlist.Great Tea Rooms of AmericaI also found a great website for sampling a large variety of teas.

3,Fair storage and speed,"Right from installing to using the Iomega Zip Drive - SM230700, it has been a smooth run. I have checked out this zip drive at a friend's place before actually ordering it online. I was given to understand that since it has a 750MB ATAPI drive to store quite a lot of data. But I would not recommend this for someone who needs more storage.The operating system required for this is MS Windows and guess it would support all the versions (mine was MS Windows NT 3.51). It did not on my Mac. But I am not keen using Mac often, so the problem doesnt arise. For my data storage, it is fairly good and a not-bad access speed too."
5,Was just what I was looking for,"My son had been wanting an internal Zip drive for his machine every since I gave it to him 4 years ago. This one worked out well, he had no problem installing it. The packing and shipping on the product was great."
4,READ THIS,"hey, for all you frustrated people who got this thinking you can go online with Mario Kart, FEAR NOT! to find out how to get online using this thing, go towww.warppipe.com it has all the answers.....and about the review, the adaptor is good but nintendo should have more online games"

1,Don't waste your money...,"Listen fanboys, there are... what... 5 games that support the BBA adaptor... only one of which is internet based? Don't waste your money... the only reason you'd want to buy this is to upload homebrew with the Fantasy Star exploit... but even then... this adaptor is only 10mbit so it would take a large amount of time to upload any sort large applications... play on PS2 online or Xbox Connect..."
