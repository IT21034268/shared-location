1,"Bad directions, hard-to-find yarn","I agree with many of the other reviews written. I thought some of the patterns were cute and quick, but now that I've knit up 4 of the patterns, I'd have to say that they are just plain wrong! The baby's cardigan sweater and hat was a disaster. The kids rollneck sweater with fuzzy heart in the middle was not true to size at all. And others were just as bad. I checked my gauge beforehand and followed the instructions to the letter; the directions are simply incorrect. Sloppy work, Suss!"
3,"great designs, poor instructions","I love the designs in this book. They are simple and clean cut, but beware. I've made several and found some issues. Her sizing is super small and I wear a 4. I make her medium to get a comfortable fitted look. Also watch the yarn requirements. I typically buy one or two skeins extra just in case. Well with her book, I have needed every extra skein to finish the project and my gauge is right on. Definately gauge swatch, because everyone I know has had to change needle size. I knit continental like the author, but I had to change as did the American style knitters I know. I would recommend the pattern styles for any young knitter, but you need a few sweaters under your belt to iron out the instruction issues. Overall I like the book, but it annoys me that the sizing is so tiny and un-realistic. It is also frustrating to really have to watch the instructions for content not just patterning information."
1,Terrible,"Let's put it this way: you'll be paying 20 bucks for a book with 90 percent of it's patterns being squares or rectangles. Of these patterns, none will fit you if you are over a size 8. That's not an exaggeration. I am a small woman (size 2) and started a sweater in the largest size that still looked too small.The tone is full of prentious celebrity name dropping, pompous self congratulations, and boring, unclear, error filled patterns. How can such SIMPLE patterns have so many errors?! very few patterns extend beyond one page. If it wasn't for the huge pictures, all these patterns could probably be filled into 5 pages of printed text.Of the cute designs, there's the orange cover sweater and a child's sweater with a heart. Comparable patterns can be easily found for free online. Do not waste your time or money."
1,Please no! Not another one!,"The whole idea of this thing is ridiculous! Kids can't make a PROFESSIANAL singer's song better, they can only make it worse! A lot worse! They totally RUINED some of my favorite songs (i.e Invisible, Hey Ya!, Me against the Music, ect.) Don't be stupid and buy the album. It will make you want to do bad, BAD things it made me want to."
1,"ENOUGH, Kidz Bop, stop!","DO NOT buy this! You would be so much better off buying the ""Now that's what I call music"" series, sung by professinals. Kidz Bop attempta to sing ""hip"" and ""popular"" songs, most likely chossen by adults in their mid life crisis. The poor children sound like they're in Preschool and are the rejects from American Idol. Don't buy this. It's a huge waste of money. The songs featured on this editon of Kidz Bop are:Disc One:1. Crazy In Love2. Hey Ya3. Are You Happy Now?4. Invisible5. It's My Life6. Here Without You7. Girls & Boys8. So Yesterday9. Calling All Angels10. Bigger Than My Body11. Forever And For Always12. Someday13. Have A Little Faith In Me14. Bright Lights15. CinderellaDisc: 21. There's Gotta Be (More To Life)2. Señorita3. Why Don't You & I4. Never Leave You (Uh Oh)5. Perfect6. Headstrong7. Me Against The Music8. Unwell9. Breathe10. Take Me Away11. Low12. Rain On Me13. Trouble14. So Far Away15. Dig It"
1,Kids SUCK.,"These kids can not sing! It's a pathetic moneymaking ploy! Listening to them actually HURTS.Kids- Here's a tip:LET THE PROFESSIONALS DO THE SINGING, AND YOU DO THE BUYING, OKAY?"
1,yuck!,This cd is awful!!!! It is the biggest insult to any of the music artists that are on here. Thank God 98 degrees was not on here they would have murdered it!!! Thank God Nick Lachey or Jessica Simpson arn't on her either the kids would have murdered them too!!! This cd is a complete disgrace!!!!! Those Kids are so off key its ridiculous. This cd should be banned from stores. Better yet it should have never been made. YUCK!!!!!!!!
1,Yuck.,"I hate this CD. As a matter of fact, I hate all of the CD's in this series. People should buy Now CD's instead, those are better and have the real versions of songs."
1,This is a sick moneymaking scheme!!!,Why listen to Kids Bop when you could listen to the songs the right way without annoying kids in the background on Now That's What I Call Music series! They even edit the songs too! And they have ppl who could sing singing the songs!!! STAY AWAY FROM KIDS BOP!!!
1,Negative 99999999 Stars,"All it is, is kids singing to songs that suck! As if the songs weren't already bad enough! There's really nothing else for me to say but recommending the following bands:Strapping Young LadSuffocationSlayerLacuna CoilMetallica(Even the new stuff is better than this crap!)DeathDeath Angel(no, they're 2 different bands)I'm done here."
1,They Ruined it,"I cant beleve they got away with singing Clay Aikens invisble, No one should go threw the pain and listen to kids sing it. theres only one person who can sing it and its Clay"
3,KidzBop is an alternative for educators,"Sadly, kids are listening to 50 Cent, Eminem and other pop music that their parents and older siblings listen to. They like it, they want to hear it, they respond to it. A Phys. Ed. teacher at an elementary school can play KidzBop while the youngsters are running laps and doing warm-ups. It can be used during after-school dance and drama clubs. The kids enjoy the familiar tunes and the school is not further exposing them to the mature and even obscene lyrics. KidzBop will not be part of a music appreciation class, but as a quick, fun motivation, it does the trick."
4,Kids like to hear KIDS sing sometimes,"The one-star reviews by parents whose kids probably love this stuff are so condescending. Most reviews miss the main point: it's fun for kids to hear other kids sing. My 6- and 7-year-old (boy and girl) love to pretend they're real singers, so listening to this music is really fun for them. It sparks their imagination. At this age I don't really mind the nasty content of the real music since they don't understand it yet, and I have them listen to that too, but these cds offer them another option. (In fact, it's pretty funny to hear them sing grown-up lyrics cluelessly.) My son's favorite music is classical. My daughter likes the Beatles and Hillary Duff. Go figure?--but don't be so quick to judge. I'm not thrilled that this one is a 2-cd set, because it's more expensive. Plus, kids usually latch onto only a few songs at a time and listen to them endlessly, so more songs are just a waste."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Not another Kids Bop cd!!!!,"Will the insanity ever stop???? I mean c'mon it's bad enough that there were Kids Bop 1-4 but now this? If you are a parent and wants your kids listening to music, here is a suggestion, let them listen to the real songs! ""Oh but those songs are rough and dirty, Kids Bop songs are clean and fun!"" Well I hate to burst your bubble sunshine but guess what they are the same song! So they add kids' voices and stuff. Well whoopdeedoo. Hey if that worked lets replace Dan Rather's voice with a kids. Please do yourself a favor a AVOID this cd! You will thank me for it."
2,Very poor playback volume,"I bought this recorder to do one-on-one interviews. I can't listen to the recordings on the actual player though, I have to transfer them to the computer and play them with an audio player- the volume of the recordings is too quiet on the recorder itself. The quality of the recordings is fine once you get them transfered. The folders and the amount of storage on the recorder are great, but if I would have known that you can not listen to the files on the recorder I would have never purchased this."
1,Poor Playback Volume,"I got this device for voice recording, specifically notes to myself.The device records well even at 2-3 feet way. The playback volume is pitiful, however, even at the highest setting. Calling support was no help as they just directed me to do what I had already done and then told me it was recommended that one should always listen to the recording through the headphones. That is inconvenient for my purposes and I don't see any place on the package or on the insert which states that."
1,A terrible product,"Save yourself some headache, this thing is very stubborn and unintuitive. It will not work on a Mac and it barely works on a PC. Try finding something that when you plug it into a computer it shows up like a regular drive instead of using some asinine proprietary garbage. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
4,Good MousePad.....but a Little to big,Well I got this mouse pad becasue Im a gamer and I was getting tired of Running outta room on my mouse pad. So I went here on the search of a mouse pad. Im pretty picky about them. And So I Found this one. Works Great Good Tracking But when it came and i Opened it. I was in for a big shock. This Mouse pad is HUGE but thats abou the only downside. So if you like huge mouse pads than this one is great. But Make Sure you got lots of room to put this pad.
4,good vest,The vest is a good vest. A lot of vel cro. A lot of pockets holds a good amount of paintballs.
3,It's nice but...,"I admire a band that can release an album that runs for 34 minutes. This usually means that the filler has been trimmed from the album, rather than the lack of worthy material. The problem here is that the songs are tracked continously so the flow isn't broken. The results are songs that sound nice and hummable, but they end up sounding the same. Miles Kurosky and his mates have crafted together a pleasant pop album but his bands and others like Apples In Stereo are just not my cup of tea. The last song, 'If We Can Land A Man On The Moon...' is a sparkling gem, and it's a shame moments like these couldn't be sustained for the whole record."
3,very easy to follow,"Even a beginner at woodworking should be able to construct these items with ordinary home equipment. PLEASE- review modern safety standards before making the cribs and high chair. Items such as the ping pong table, playhouse, bookcases, toboggan, and rocking boat will always be appreciated."
5,Works as expected at a great price,"Instead of having to drive to Home Depot and waste gas, make a line, and pay sales tax, these light bulbs were delivered free and at a better price. They work just as you would expect from a light bulb."
2,Only 5 to Even Start With,"Just got these. Put the first one in and 2 seconds later it burnt out! The other 3 I used seem fine, but will stick with Phillips next time."
1,Not Sylvania bulbs....,"When I received these bulbs they we in a Sylvania box that had been re-taped with package tape, not that big of a deal. However when I open the bulbs I say that none of them were stamped with the Sylvania marking that I have become accustom to. As a matter of fact there were no markings at all on he bulb, save for a made in china, voltage and wattage around the Edison screw. I will not buy these again."
1,Doesn't ship well?,I read the reviews and I can say that it is true that bulbs did not work upon arrival at my doorstep. Five bulbs worked but one burned out instantly after being screwed in. So I got four working bulbs for the price of six. Not the best deal.
1,Big disappointment,"I was in the process of ordering TCP Light Bulbs; when I noticed the Sylvania Bulbs. I went ahead and purchased the Sylvania mainly because of $10 price difference.The packaging was intact all looked good, except when I installed the first one it emitted a light for a portion of a second and went dead. Took it out installed a second bulb exactly the same. The third one was ok. At this stage I repacked the bulbs. Submitted a return order on Amazon. Then bought the TCP Bulbs and are great as my previous experience (see my earlier review).I think that Amazon should not charge the shipping cost to the customer BUT to Sylvania because of their defective product. It ended up that I had to pay the shipping cost which was $9 while the Bulbs were for $13.53. Simply in my attempt to save $10 I lost $9."
3,Just Okay,"I ordered a package of indoor flood lights because of the good price. I have only tried to use 2 out of the pack so far and one of them was bad, which already cancels out the good price. Not sure yet what will happen when I try to use the rest of them. So that being said, I probably will not order from them again. But the delivery was prompt and they appeared to be packaged very well. I have not contacted them about the bad bulb so can't rate customer service in that area."
2,Warning: These are NOT 120V bulbs,"I recently received a box of 6. All 6 worked, but I noticed a message on the box that said they were for 130V, not 120V. Now that I noticed this, I see that the listing on Amazon clearly indicates that they are 130V bulbs. I just didn't read because I have never encountered a bulb with a standard Edison screw base for anyhting other than 120V.They make light at 120V, just not a much as you want. You have been warned..."
4,"Bulbs great. Packaging, not so much.","Theae bulbs integrate seamlessly with the 120 volt bulbs in the other fixtures. I can't tell the difference in the light output or color. I hope they will last longer than the 120 volt, as they should, since it's a pain to change them!I agree with others, hwever, about the packaging. It's a testament to UPS that they arrived unbroken! The box was incredibly flimsy, and actually ""imploded"" and coming apart, due to poor tape. The bulb pack itself was wrapped in very thin bubble wrap, and was essentially loose in the box, with 2 half-deflated blister packs on one side only. Sheesh, Amazon! What would it cost to package these adequately? Certainly less than the returns you must have!"
4,"Does what it's suppose to do, and save money",Saved a ton by buying this in bulk versus the local store. Saved time and money because independently these can become quite expensive. Well worth it... so GET IT!
2,4 Months in and I've replaced all 4 of 6 bulbs,"I expect them to last longer then 4 months with low usage. I used the bulbs as designed for an indoor flood light. I wish I could say that Sylvania was the only bulb I've had this problem with but it isn't. I hate to say it, but ""they just don't make them like they used to."""
2,Disappointed. Not very bright.,"Hoping these would replace the terrible CFL's that take a while to ""warm up"" until they are fully lit. These provide a yellowish glow, and they are not very bright. I guess adequate is the best description. Would not buy again. Would pay more for a better product. Descriptions/ reviews/ searching categories for light bulbs on Amazon are terrible!"
5,So far good,With my Prime membership I decided to pay to have these delivered locally which means someone picks them up at Amazon (hopefully with care) and delivers them in their car to my house. But I watched the delivery guy just toss them on my porch! They were fairly well packaged and fortunately none broke. Still probably better then the back of a delivery truck.I got these not only for the price but because the new bulbs government is forcing on us take a while to light up.These are slightly brighter then most bulbs we've tried. I have no idea the value and don't really care but they work.Question will be how long they last.
2,"It Turns On. It Turns Off. Oh, and it's yellow.","We purchased these to replace a bunch of blown bulbs in our office. Maybe I've become spoiled by all the new-fangled daylight bulbs, but I can't describe the light as anything other than a rustic yellow. It's quite relaxing, but not really a good fit for a working design studio.If you're looking for an intimate old-fashioned light then this is great. If you're trying to draw or read you may want to try something else.I wouldn't recommend these for anything other than home use."
1,Cheap For a Reason,"I have a series of six ceiling lights in a roughly 50 square foot area, so they are all close to each other. There are different brands and types of bulbs being used. This Sylvania product is the poorest performer and ugliest.It has heavy branding on the surface, so you can easily see the marking, even from an angle. It is dim by comparison and I believe that is due to the extremely poor diffusion of the light (you can easily see the glow of the filament compared to all other bulbs. That means that the bulb has little diffusion of the light across its' surface. This is much like comparing a clear bulb to a frosted bulb.I'll have to switch these junko's out, throw out the rest of what I bought, and get something suitable to a home environment (these are probably acceptable in a warehouse environment). Unfortunately, Sylvania has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I cannot take a risk on their other grades of bulbs."
1,Slow delivery,Ordered almost two weeks ago...got email about shipping problem and said it would arrive Dec 9...have yet to receive the package...will repost a review once I receive the product to comment on the quality but for now...not happy.
5,amazing,"I'm still amazed that this fixed my problem. I cursed out the tivo people for even suggesting it. But, those geeks were right. No more skipping or pauses and now I can enjoy my regularly scheduled programming. Thanks 16db whatever attenuator something or other!"
2,eh.,"i can't get these boba to cook right. i've tried many different methods, many different times. these don't seem to cook as well as other brands. i wouldn't buy this brand again."
3,A get-in-touch with Griegs music starter DVD,"Starting with a typical norwegian waterfall, this DVD brings us Griegs Folk and Dance Melodies and the Piano concerto in A minor Op 16. The Sound is available in DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 where the DTS sound slighty sounds better. The picture quality is rather poor - but not the most important part. To speak about the sound. It is clear and and shows dynamic in the lower and higher parts but it is not as good as a true Grieg lover might want it to be. So i reccomand it for starters who want to get in touch with Griegs music and for the others i hope we get a real high end recording by a world famous orchestra sometimes (not the usual eastern europe radio symponic orchestras)"
4,vocabulary on the go,"this is great for driving around in the car, learning vocabulary. It is a fairly useful collection, nicely divided into 4 DVDs of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, and expressions. Level 1 is more useful than Level 2."
3,Excellent Hand Quilting Instructions,"I read this book before I started to hand quilt. It was thorough and detailed but still not enough. I had to find someone to show me how to hand quilt, so I could see it visually. The book, in my opinion, did not stress the need to push up underneath the quilt with your forefinger or middle finger. It only took someone 5 minutes for me to understand how to quilt and two weeks of practice. I now quilt 7-8 stitches per inch."
5,"good price, great value",North American Predators - Episodes from Marty Stouffer's Wild America As Seen On PBSWe bought this for my Father-in-law because he likes to watch Marty Stouffer's Wild America; but can never remember when it's on TV.It's a timeless gift he will watch over and over for many years.
2,Snooze Fest,"This video was extremely slow and boring; even the narrators commentary was lack luster. In my opinion, the video simply talked about how and what the animals eat, and their place on the food chain sorta speak. You can get this same info from PBS, as a matter of fact, it was a repeat of what we'd already seen. If you want adventure and excitement, this is not the video to purchase; save your money!"
3,This DVD had both pluses and minuses,"Excellent, close-up footage of wildlife and nature.However, I disagreed with author's values/belief system.He seems to believe that it's OK for predators to kill innocent wildlife [that's not really wrong or cruel??] yet seems to object to killing the predators. For example, its OK to hunt and kill harmless rabbits or deer yet, at the same time, we need to protect the hunters/killers?Isn't that a bit backwards?"
1,Very crude,"One gets the feeling that this book was published slightly too late to be the rambunctious hit the author wanted. Offensive humour was becoming rather passe, and so those such as Leary were obliged to be even more offensive in order to be noticed.Satire? I don't think so."
5,This book had me in tears I was laughing so hard.,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is Denis Leary's stand-up routine put into book form. I used to commute from New Jersey into Manhattan and you should have seen the stares I was getting from fellow commuters because I was laughing out loud while I was reading it. Leary's cynical view on drugs, drinking, rock and roll bands and life in general is a roller coaster ride of laughs. Buy this book and you will laugh loud and often."
1,Fraud,"I wondered why I only had to pay a penny for this book.** Special Note: There is an illegally printed book, called ""The Toughest Man Alive"" floating around. Please, please, please do not buy, sell, trade, or deal in that book for any reason. If you bought a copy, please go back where your purchased it, and demand a refund. Ask for the only authorized and complete book ""The Godfather of Grappling"".Fiaz Rafiq, owner of Health 'n' Life (HNL) Publishing got an incomplete manuscript, full of errors, without Gene's permission. HNL Publishing offered a contract, which was refused by Gene and never signed. HNL went ahead and published the book anyway, without permission, and completely contrary to any of Gene's wishes. Furthermore, neither Gene or the ghost writer (Bob Calhoun) have ever been paid a dime for any of the copies sold. Legal action is being taken against HNL Publishing, Fiaz Rafiq, and anyone that sells, deals, or trades in that book."
2,Disappointed,"I was searching for the discontinued(original product)Olay Total Effects Age Defying Cleansing Cloths, which was a much more substantial material and had a coarser exfoliating surface. When I saw the black packaging in the advertisement I just knew I had found it, especially considering the very inflated price. The product I received had a cream colored outer package, not the black as shown in their picture. Unfortunately the description of the product is misleading, and the pricing is inflated."
4,"It's a clutch replacement kit, plain and simple.","It is just a replacement kit and there isn't much to comment on. Everything was there. It came quickly. Really liked that it has the dummy shaft and I didn't have to make one. There were no instructions, so if you need instructions you better consult with someone to make sure you know what you are doing.I've done this kind of work before so didn't have many questions or problems. My biggest problem was removing the pilot bearing, but that's just part of the dis-assembly effort. Still, an instruction sheet would have been nice to aid in this task.End result: vehicle runs fine."
5,An old fan raves,The best ska/reggae record ever! To hear this music live is an experience that grooves the senses and inspires the soul. A must see event for anyone that owns this record and loves the message. They move you through an evening like no other band around. Think The Slackers but smarter and with more depth. Excellent!
5,"Emerson, Lake, and Palmer piano songbook","A good selection of hits - the music is moderately difficult, and in several different keys -but, seems accurately transcribed, as it sounds just like the vocals."
4,EXCELLENT,"All the songs that I wanted were in this book, It has answered alot of questions I had about playing ELP"
2,Unequal volume level,"The content of the DVD is good, however it is not user-friendly (it does not playback the videos sequentially) and the volume is not leveled from one video to the next."
1,Poorly contructed Makeup case,"I bought this directly from Yazmo. This makeup case is very large - too large to be sitting on top of a vanity or dresser.My main gripe is about the quality of the construction, which is terrible. The leather lining was glued hapzardly to the case with wrinkles and gaps. The plastic compartments are flimsy and the whole case had a strong chemical smell. I tried to place a return but they have not sent an RMA number and their customer service number rings without answer. Then I get ""this mailbox is currently full"". Terrible customer service as well."
4,Great songs but hefty price . . .,"Not very cheap for just four songs. Fortunately, three of the four (the latter four) are simply unforgetable."
5,PUMPED UP!,THis disk is full of chunky beats and rhymes that'll get you pumped up! The whole disk is an anthem for the Christ follower. Raw POWER and STraight up Dopeness! Pick this one uuuup!
5,only cause there ain't 6,"one word inparational phat hot bad(but in a good way) just a nice job on a christian cd ""The Story"" gave me chills the first time i listened too it if you ain't heard it hear it soon"
3,Good but not Great,"This CD is good but not great. The two songs that are the best were ""God vs Man"" and ""The Story"". But truthly it is not on the level of Crossmovement or Gospel Gangstaz. The rapping was not flowing. But it is ok. The tracks were ok, seem a little old. Good ministry in the songs."
1,To be honest....FLAT.,"After hearin all the hype about this album, I decided to order it online without listening to any tracks. MISTAKE. People compare these guys to the Cross Movement? Ouch.The opening track, Raiderz Anthem, was tight until the chick started singing. She totally ruined the energy of the song! My spirit was lifted then dropped! As did the rest of the album. Just full of redundant beats and ill-timed flows. Despite my negativity, I can say one thing positive about this release: God vs. Man was a 'good' song. Awesome lyrics and a good flow!This could not be compared to anything secular. Please don't try to! Christians should start aiming for excellence instead of 'okay-ness'.Needless to say, I got rid of this album today.Better luck next time :(**JUST BEING HONEST**"
4,Is there a Better First Album??,"As first albums go this is about where Lynne wants to be. Great songs, great sounds and a hint of more to come!!!!!!! This is why music lovers listen to music....it is moving and passionate. When I first saw Lynne on a UTube clip, I was surprised how young she is. Her voice and style has a real majesty which is usually only achieved after years of writing and, of course, pain. It is with great pride that I know we will hear this gifted Ottawa girl for years to come, she is the 'Real Deal'.Don't take it from me.....go out and buy this CD and then go and see this charming songstress live in a city near you!!!! She is a treat."
2,Not as advertised ...,"This roll is only 40ft, not 50ft as advertised. Other than that, the product is as described."
5,Made the party!,"This scene setter made my party a huge success! It created an atmosphere of a casino, and it pulled together the whole theme! A must have!"
5,Excellent!,"What a great sleeper movie!IMHO I would rank this up there with Band of Brothers, the drama was superb, the characters were fleshed out enough that you got to know them fairly well before the end of the movie.Some here have pointed out small inaccuracies, no argument there but show me a war film that is perfect??I strongly recommend this film!"
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:For a low budget film Saints and Soldiers looks impeccable, but its unwillingness to rise above cliche (the group who survives the Malmedy Massacre consists of, ahem, the tough sergeant, farm boy, New York Jew, and Bible-thumper), poor dialogue, and lack of realism (no one swears) doom the film."
2,Propaganda Ruined the Film,"Good start, nice little war movie...but it was obvious that there was a hidden message about Mormonism sprinkled throughout the film. This type of subtle propaganda (typical of the Latter Day ""Saints"") ruined the film for me. I guess they wanted some talking points when they come knocking on yer door. Next time, leave the religion out."
3,Good movie,"A good, solid movie with some depth and character development. Worth watching. Battle scirmishes were done well too."
4,"Deja vu, but worth buying.","At some point I felt like I've seen this before. The plot and plot elements are reminiscent of war films of the 40's and 50's, and episodes of ""Combat"" with Vic Morrow from the 60's.It's not an epic with huge special effects, but it's more real-feeling than most of the old-time war movies that had a lot of corniness or newsreel feel in them.This movie definitely deserves a spot in your movie collection either in your war-movie section or church section."
5,worthy of adding to your library,"I saw this film on the big screen and was amazed at the filmmaker's ability to put you right into the action as rapidly and seamlessly as he did. Yes, it is a small film, no, there are no ""Bridge Too Far"" explosions and ""Pearl Harbor"" love scenes, but it is a tightly scripted study of the intimacies of prolonged duress on a small band of men, who at times are not pulling all in the same direction. Very poignant and very classy. Like a great classic film instead of the noisy, violent bloodfests that pass for war films now. As a former military wife, I know of many men like those portrayed here, some profane, some somber, many with values different than mine, but certainly all were honorable men who put their lives on hold and in harm's way and this film honors them. And the soundtrack is one of the most hauntingly beautiful pieces of work you will ever hear."
3,For USA viewers,"I am not gonna talk about the movie. Its a pure classic. As I am a big war movie fan I had to own this in my collection. I used to have the DVD, but after I started upgrading to BD, I was badly looking for this movie on BD. Well, it didn't look like the movie's gonna get a BD release in USA in the near future, so I had to buy the UK version. If you have a region A (USA) BD player, you can only watch the movie, but can't watch the extra features (Blu-ray.com say its all playable). I recently bought 3 UK BDs - this one, Katyn and Assembly. All of them are region free but only the feature films. All extra features are region B (locked), which means they will not play in your region A BD player.the 3* are just because of the non-playable extra-features, but if I consider the movie only, off course *****."
5,"Excellent Footage, Excellent Heart Wrenching Truths of WWII",This movie depicts excellent footage and acting that conveys less documented heart wrenching truths of WWII. I highly recommend this movie for those that have served in WWII against the Germans of the day. Simply tearful.
3,Another So-So WW-II Movie,"Interesting, but will never make the ""Main Stream"" of WW-II movies. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a real WW-II fanatic."
3,Saints And Soldiers,My review for Saints and Soldiers is a follows. This movie is not bad at all. The story holds your interest. It is suspenseful and it is based on actual World War 2 events. I paid $2.23 + S/H $ 2.98 = $5.21 it was worth that and that it no more than that.
5,A war movie with heart,"I like Saints and Soldiers because it's a moving war movie, with heart, good acting, a nice plot, and is low on the gore.It definatly shows the hardships of what a very religious man goes through. (Of course, to most, we know the man is a Mormon...but the film doesn't say that, so he can be used generically, and so no one drops the film just because of a Mormon character).I recommend the film. Very moving."
4,Good War Movie's don't have to be Big Budget,"By the director and producer's own admission they made this film on a shoe string, yet it does not look like it. Nor does it feel like it. The story, as well as the action is very good and I highly recommend it."
2,Very Average,"When Damien Lewis played Major Winter in Band of Brothers he was convincing as an Englishman playing an American; but the Flt Sgt in this film was awful. His accent was wrong, his manner wrong and it was cartoonish. A British pilot would expect to be shot down behind enemy lines - reconnaissance planes were unarmed - he would know how to behave and certainly would not be discussing American Presidents.This made the film cretinous and it lacked the edge of films like Stalingrad, Kokoda - 39th Battalion, or even Battle of The Bulge. It was not crisp and lacked tightness - and the Stand-Up Comedian playing the British RAF pilot - Kirby Heyborne - he was simply awful"
5,The Real Jack,I was very excited to see that Jack would finally released a solo CD. It shows that he's come into his own as not only a solo artist but also shows how well he collaborates with the other members of NR and the various special guests. You can very easily see early influences on this CD. It's not only a tribute to him but also to the other artist who helped mold him during his early years. The only thing better than this CD would be Jack's second solo CD. I highly recommend this CD.
4,This CD Shines On and on!,"I'll admit that I bought this CD because I love Night Ranger and I didn't know what to expect with this CD. When I listened to it, I found that while there are some Night Ranger-like melodys, for the most part, it has a very distinct and separate sound. The more I've listened to it, the more I love it! Jack Blades is an extremely talented songwriter, and this truly showcases his different writing and singing styles and continues to prove what all Night Ranger fans know, and that's what an amazing talent he is. I'd buy it all over again!"
4,Good,"This is a good album that grows on you after at least 3 listens. It's not Night Ranger (or Damn Yankees), but still recommended for Night Ranger fans. This is a diverse collection of songs that sound up-to-date while still maintaining a classic rock vibe. Very worthwile to have this."
1,It grows on you?? Get an antibiotic!!,"The only thing tolerable about this album is the decent cover of ""Nature's Way"". Nice job Jack! This song is no reason to listen repeatedly to this album. The remainder of the cuts are college bar band material. Sorry Night Ranger fans, this does not stir the sleeping hair band giant in me."
4,"Art Meets Occultism, and not for the first time...","For those of you who have spent considerable time reading about the Templars, Illuminatus, Masons, et. al. then this book would be of no shock to you. Francis Bacon in the disquise of an artist, in the disquise of the painted. The art itself lends itself to the greater mystery, and as such is a must have for any enthusiast."
1,Never got it,"I have made several inquries , but have gotten nowhere, I am very frustrated about this order because it has caused a serious delay in an important project"
2,Import(polish)hhs bit...,"This bit is a poor quality item... I wasn't expecting it to last my lifetime, but only to drill a few straight holes in cast iron about 1/4 of an inch thick. The bit wasn't up to the task. Even with a good pilot hole to start with this bit jumped around and began to show wear before finishing the first hole. The resulting hole was anything but round and was not able to be tapped like I originally intended. I don't think I'll be buying anymore Polish tooling.It was shipped in a timely manner, though..."
5,Great Beck Read,This book contains so much info you have to read it twice. It is wonderfully written and the pictures are most excellent. It's a very un-biased account of Jeff's daily routines. This is not to be missed.
5,Another good Hank Haney product,This guy is great at putting good tips that are very easy to follow. I have been impressed with all of the Hank Haney products I have purchased and this item is no different.
3,Order was canceled with no notice.,"I ordered this DVD and Amazon showed it was still coming, but when I checked my credit card, saw that it was credited and order canceled, but I never got a notice about that. I was waiting for weeks for it to arrive, then realized they canceled it for no known reason. I can't rate the item never having received it, but the service was poor."
4,A great compilation,"Hombres G is one of the most famous spanish rock pop band in the last 20 years. Anyone who was able to listen to them when they got their boom can realize that most of their great songs are within this album. Masterpieces as ""Te quiero"" [I love you], ""Temblando"" [Shaking], ""Si No Te Tengo A Ti"" [If I Wouldn't Have You], ""Te Necesito"" [I Need You], ""Estoy Pintando Tu Sonrisa"" [I'm Drawing Your Smile] show their greatest pure rock balads, unfortunately ""Un Par De Palabras"" [A Couple Of Words] is missing in this really good album. You can find many other funny songs within the album. Lyrics could sound nonsense or jokes; however, rock rythms and a euphoria voice get you into tune with this worldwide spanish rock band."
4,this will will sucker does not know anything...,"Firs, this will will is a loser he does not know anything about this band...everybody knows that these hombres g became famous before heroes del silencio u dork, back in the days, this band rocked, I do not like them as much but it brings me memories....of their music and my childhood."
4,Un rato chevere,"Harmless fun. As usual.Not any kind of ground-breaking music or poetry. If you can't see the humor in it, then keep away.Sufre, mamon!"
1,pop ochentero para niñitas huecas,este odioso grupo con melodias oreja y letras sacadas de algun programa infantil tuvo engrupidas a muchas niñas en los 80 que compraron toda su pomada desechable. afortunadamente fue una moda que tal como llego se fue rapidamente y ojala que para siempre.
3,Interesting black b-movie 3.5 stars,"I rented this little movie largely because i read on it's cover that it was written by Erick Dickey. Yes, the writer of sisters and lovers and the more recent cheaters. The movie is kind of like a black low budget version of Body Heat with a few twists. Overall I found it rather entertaining. It's in Black and white so it really has that film nior vibe going it. It was a largely black cast, something you rarely see in any film noir movies. The directions wasn't really thrilling but competent, the acting was average. There were no name stars in it. but it really didn't hurt the story that much. The script written by Erick Jerome Dickey wasn't too bad. The dialogue was pretty sharp and there were only a couple of plot holes in it but nothing major. It's worth a good rent for a couple of dollars."
4,Good African American Movie,This was a good movie. It was just like reading one of his books. It will make anybody think before making a crazy mistake. I give a 4.5. Check it out.
1,what happened?,"I was thrilled by ""The Fireman's Wife."" An absolute masterpiece of a story. Even ""The Last Good Time"" held me through a rather mundane, magicless world of the over-ordinary with sustained interest...""Violence,"" on the other hand, drilled in me a hole out through which a lot of my respect for Mr. Bausch leaked. This book plods and plods, wanting to be held up by Bausch's reverence for the common, but with no strength to its pylons. A shame, a shame."
2,Not Bret's biography,Folks save your money. This is not the long awaited autobiography that all Bret Hart fans have been waiting so long for. This is at best a coffee table book with some nice pictures. The book is really by Perry Lefko and Bret has contributed to it but it is NOT the book we have all been waiting for. He is in fact in the midst of writing it now during his layoff from a severe concussion.
1,Bret has more interesting stories than this drivle...,"I am shocked that Bret Hart, who participated in a cutting edge, expose' such as ""wrestling with shadows"" would write a book that has such little substance. The book can be read in less than an hour. It has some nice pictures but Bret has virtually no behind the scenes information and pretty much glosses over his split with the WWF and his brother Owen's death. Bret is even in character at times which makes this book unfortunetly more like the kayfabe Arn Anderson book and less like Mick Foley's masterpiece. This book is definitely not the best there is, was, or ever will be."
1,Disappointed,"Although I thought this book would be a comprehensive guide to Bret's life and career, I had hoped for more insight into his actual self. It doesn't really feel like Bret really had anything to do with this book. I love Bret, but not his book"
2,NO WWF PICTURES.,THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT BRET IN WCW WINNING THE US TITLE AND MATCHS WITH STING IN THE SHARPSTOORER.PS IF YOU LIKE BRET IN THE WCW DAYS THAN BUT IT.
1,"Worst book there is, was, or ever will be.","This is a ridiculous pamphlet with pictures of Bret and his title belts. This egomaniac wants us to believe that he won championships through fierce competition. We are led to believe that nothing is scripted and Bret actually wins titles by outwrestling his hated opponents. Bret doesn't even write it himself, no, it's poorly written by a ""professional"". It's basically a summary of some of Bret's matches over the years. YAWN."
3,Three Stars for Eliza Dushku,"I bought this sight unseen because I like Eliza Dushku. The series is good because of her. Her boss is OK too.The bad... Jason Priestly and the loser brother. I was hoping Jason Priestly would have faded into oblivion after that 90210 show. His character on this show is annoying. His acting also seems to be inspired by a visit to a lumberyard.The brother. Major loser. Always losing money by gambling. Always, always, always does the wrong thing. The epitome of selfish. His routine gets very old very fast.It looks as if someone watched ""Run Lola Run"" and thought it would be a great concept for a TV series. It's easy to see why this show didn't run longer.Bottom line.... if you are an Eliza Dushku fan, buy this. If not, pass."
4,Truthful Tale of Sicilian Mob,This artfully shot film shows how the Sicilian mob corrupted honest men and women to do their dirty work back in the post-war era. Great performance by Alberto Soldi.
5,Love This CD,Love Mindy McCready and Love this CD. I lessen to it every day on my way home from work. No scratches and good price!
5,"Great deal, good cause","This knife set showed up under the tree this year and I am glad it did. The set is practical, incorporating the 3 most used knives in the kitchen. The paring knife is slightly larger than average and makes quick work of small vegetables, and fruits. The utility knife is versatile, extremely effecient, and saws neatly through just about anything. The East/West knife is a smaller rendition of a classic chef's knife with very good balance and smooth, precise cutting. It sliced through 75% frozen chicken like it was a warm knife through butter. The handles are extremely non-slip, comfortable, albeit a bit gaudy with the blaze orange coloring. The case is functional with handle grooves and silicone covered magnets to hold the blades in place. You could easily spend this on a quality chef's knife alone, but this set includes just that and 2 bonus knives making it a very nice bargain."
5,Kitchen Knives,"Who me cooking? Yes, I thought it was about time I owned some knives that actually cut through all the way without pounding...I love the knives a lot actually...they look great, cut well and now when I watch Rachael Ray I can keep up ..."
3,Rachel Ray Furi Knives,"The knives came promptly after the order was serviced by Amazon.The knives were reasonably sharp, not the sharpest I've ever seen, but adequate.Instructions indicate that they are NOT dishwasher safe, a surprise to me, given their cost (over $100.00 for three knives).My wife is satisfied, the only REAL criteria, after using them, therefore, I'm satisfied.I probably would NOT buy them for myself."
1,Poor Parenting Practices continue!,"It's not enough that Mrs. Ezzo and Bucknam have misguided parents in the infant and toddler years! Now they have to suggest poor, rigid and abusive tactics for preschoolers and primary students too. Christian parents who want to raise godly children do NOT have to follow this book!It is another book in a series of misinformation, stereotypical suggestions and just plain poor parenting. Why did I buy it? So that I would understand why parents of teens in 5-10 years complain about their relationships with their teens. They have not built a love relationship with their children if they follow the authors' teachings. They have built an autocratic, punitive, manipulative one instead.Thankfully, many churches are no longer using the ""Prep"" series in their parenting classes. This book adds to the reasons why these authors should be avoided!"
1,NOt Wise,"Gary Ezzo is not qualified to give feeding and babycare advice. He has been discredited over and over, and dropped by his publishser. He continues to publish these on his own. Look up Gary Ezzo on the internet for the critiques of this material. Don't do this to your baby!"
1,Research at ezzo.info before using any Gary Ezzo book,Childwise is the secular version of Gary Ezzo's series Growing Kids God's Way taught in Christian churches- he just either removed the Scriptural passages or calls them Jewish proverbs. I know many parents at my church who have taken these classes and wish they never had heard of these books. One couple I know who actually know the Ezzo's say it almost ruined their marriage. Many others say they now know better and wish they had not followed many things in his book and feel guilty about what they put their children through. Save yourself future guilt and research carefully before using any of Gary Ezzo's books.[...] The 'good' in his books are common sense ideas found in much better books.
1,There are many better books,"Gary Ezzo has been removed from 3 different churches. Focus on the Family, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Christianity today and a multitude of others have determined this man to be dangerous to babies and children. There are many better parenting books out there. Try a book that deals specifically with Mothering, as mothers should turn to other mothers to learn this skill and not abusive, controversial men. Byt the way, I have 3 wonderful children who are obedient, polite, well mannered and a joy to be around. I did not Ezzo them, I loved them."
1,Doesn't work!,"I ordered this, thinking it would be simple to use and easier than the pills. At first, I thought it worked, but soon figured it was my brain. After 2 days and 2 patches later, I was always hungry again. This does not work, don't waste your money! I still have 26 patches left. I switched to the hoodia pill from GNC, it works, unlike these patches."
4,GOOD APPETITE SUPPRESSANT,"This is my 3rd go round with this product.. I've been on it consistentlyfor 3 weeks and have lost 7 pounds.. I haven't changed my eating habitsand still eat brownies and weight watchers ice cream BUT don't eat thewhole thing anymore..My problem was after dinner I would graze for snacks 2 hours later andI gained 5 pounds BUT as I said, this helps.. You're eating and all ofa sudden you realize you are satisfied after eating 1/2.. it takes abouta 3 days to a week,, that is my experience and I see by the other comments,some people state it didn't work for them but give it a chance, if aftera week you don't notice you are eating less, I would search for anotherappetite suppressant but I liked this product and will continue toorder..."
2,Not sold on this product.,"Personally, I really don't know if this product works or not. If you are looking for a miracle patch that will not make you hungry then this patch is not for you. I have not noticed a decrease in hunger since I have been on the patch, at this point I am going to try something else. I bought this product just like everyone else, I needed to lose some weight and thought this was my little miracle. It's not! One more thing I didn't like about this product was that when I would work out the patch would come off, due to the sweat. If this is the case how can it be effective? Are we not suppose to work out? I have come to the conclusion that the only way to really lose weight is to work out."
5,A pleasant surprise...,"This new anime based on the hit selling comic is very enjoyableand intriguing. After watching the 4 episodes I couldn't wait for the next installment. The animation, characters, soundtrack, and plot are all done extremely well. Baki, a 13 year old take-no-s*hit kind of fighter, is always out looking for the next great challenge which makes this a violent, fast-paced series.During the viewing I was reminded of another excellent anime series, Fighting Spirit, so if you're enjoying that series then Baki is right up your alley.This DVD is also available in the DVD starter kit, so it looks like there might be about 6 or 7 DVD's total in this set."
4,Tough Kid,The only problem with Baki the Grappler is the animation is pretty crappy but besides that the series is perfect.Baki is fearless and ruthless and barley a teen. He will stop at nothing and fight whomever until he is crowned the greatest fighter and gets the respect he wants. There are several mysteries about Baki that are waiting to be uncovered like if Baki has a rich mother that loves him and even comes to visit him time from time then why does he live in a neighborhood filled with people that hate him by himself. The fighting is pretty good but Baki seems to get beat up a lot because he's either outnumbered or just plain old beaten fare and square. Hopefully after a while we'll be able to understand more things about the series.
2,What is this stuff?,"I have been drinking Earl Grey for over 30 years and sadly watched the demise of my favored vendors one by one. After the last disappearance, I tried the Taylors on the basis of the reviews. Disappointment is not the right word. It smelled strange out of the box, and after brewing it properly discovered that it bore no resemblance to the dozens of different Earl Grey experiences I have had. It is heavily dominated by the peaty nature of the Chinese black tea base (almost an Oolong) and the bergamot is barely detectable. Unique, but not what I want. De gustibus non disputandem."
3,Potent Bergomot,"This does not have the strongest Bergomot odor of all Earl Grey teas I have tried, but it does have the strongest Bergomot taste. It is not as balanced as Bigelow's, and not weak like Twining's Bergomot. It covers up all the tea taste, you can't tell what kind of tea it is. It is economical to use, since you have to use less. I love Bergomot aroma, but I'm not this partial to its flavor. Others have complainted of heavy Bergomot in Rishi's Earl Grey, but although its odor is extemely powerful, its it does have some tea flavor.This is good to mix with plain tea to introduce Bergomot taste."
1,Terrible,So disappointed. Very thick and sticky consistency. Way too heavy caused breakouts after one use. Also not for sensitive skin caused redness.
5,first time user .....,light weight and it's Not greesy feeling at all very hydrating makes me look dewy! So far I'm happy with this product!
3,It's alright..,"I've only had this cream for about a week now but so far so good. It is so smooth and creamy and really makes makeup go on smoothly. The one thing I don't like is if you use too much and don't rub it in really well right away it will flake off like peeling skin later in the day. I can't say much about its effects on lines or age spots yet but hopefully it helps!UPDATE: This lotion isn't really living up to my expectations. I'm not convinced it actually changes anything about your skin, it just slightly masks flaws. Once I run out I'm going back to my AveenoAveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 - 4 oz."
2,Not so much:(,I have combination skin which has become more dry this winter so I was looking for extra moisture. I did not like this moisturizer. I found it to be too fragrant and left my skin feeling more dry. I also felt that it left an uncomfortable residue on my face. I really like facial products that feel clean and natural. This did not for me.
3,"OKAY,BUT WAY TOO SMALL!!!",bought this for about 20 dollars great cream but extremely small size of a finger!! looks so much bigger but its sort of a rip off i put the cream on has great scent but no difference on my skin . i dont reccomend this for its price and size.
3,Touch of Sun? I think not...,"I love Olay products because they are the only drugstore brand that prevents my skin from breaking out. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the Touch of Sun moisturizer that promises to help build a natural tan on your face. I used the product daily for a week and noticed no change in my skin color at all. I don't really think there is any self tanner in this product at all! The only plus is that the product does moisturize well and keeps my skin soft and clear, but if you're buying it for the gentle self tanner, you'll be disappointed."
4,A great daily moisturizer if you're prone to dry skin,"I struggle with dry skin and this product does the trick. It's not too heavy for me but it might be a little too much for someone with oily skin, especially in the warmer months. If you're worried about turning orange, don't fret. I'm very fair skinned and I only used this moisturizer once a day as indicated on the bottle and got exactly the effect that was advertised, a ""touch of sun"". I can't say too much about it's anti-aging factors as I'm only just beginning to develop pesky fine lines, but they haven't gotten any worse in the last month since I've been using this product.In general I'd say this is a great moisturizer but I'm not thrilled with the price point."
3,No Touch From The Sun,"I found that this product is not work the high price. I have been using this for about a month now and I have never noticed that it has added any kind of color to my complex. I have been using sunless tanning lotions for years now. I don't think there is one of the market that I have not tried. I have extremely fair skin and I feel like I need to keep some kind of sunless tanning lotion on my skin to maintain a color that helps me look ""normal"". Also, I can say that for about 15 minutes after I apply this lotion my complex does look more even then when using other skin lotions for the face, but after about 15 minutes or so, my skin looks and feels no different then with any other lower price face lotion. I would probably continue to purchase this product if the cost was much less."
5,It works & it is good for sensitive skin!,"First off, I love Oil of Olay products they are great! But I switched to this moisturizer bc my skin was getting very dry from a rash that I had!It is creamy, smells good, & it doesnt make my sensitive skin breakout. I have Acne Prone skin & big pores between my eyebrows and cheeks. I noticed when doing my makeup the other day that the pores on my cheeks are much smaller then they used to be! I didnt use this moisturizer for the ""anti aging"" effects, just bc of the creaminess of it & Im surprised that it actually minimized my pores. Although it is creamy it doesnt make my skin look extra oily (I have oily skin). I definitely recommend this you cant go wrong!"
2,Too dry for me,"I love Olay brand and have been using Olay products. However, compare with other Olay moisturizers, this UV moisturizer is too dry for me. I could see my skin even show some dry lines in the afternoon. So every time I have to use it together with some moisturizing lotion. Don't think I will buy it any more."
1,Smells awful,"I was so excited to try this based on the reviews, but the smell is terrible. It smells like the tanning lotion people wear to go in a tanning bed but after you have been tanning. Like a burnt tanning lotion smell. I'm very disappointed. I had to wash it off my face immediately."
1,Peels off face after a few minutes,"I don't know why I am the only one who has posted this result on here, but I have tried this moisturizer (the Original one), on two separate days on perfectly clean skin, and after a few minutes it starts peeling off in little shavings all over my face, wherever I rub with my hands.This was disastrous when I put it on before my makeup one day; I had to reapply everything!I don't know if it's just an old shipment I received, because I don't see an expiration date on it, but I know that I will not be repurchasing or using this anymore. I threw it out."
1,awful.,"I normally use regenerist which works great, so this time I thought I'd try one of Olay's other products. It might have been a coincidence but while I used I had breakouts and my skin was dry. Save your money."
4,Very good product,"I used this product for a while and it worked very well on my skin. When Olay came up with regenerizer, I switched, and like it best. However, I still do use this as a middle of the day moisturezer when needed, and it still works very well."
1,Tested on Animals,"Olay is made by Proctor and Gamble, a company that still tests on animals even when it is NOT required by law. They will swear it is only done when no other means available, but how is that true when other cosmetic companies DON'T test on animals?This cruelty is not worth vanity. I'll stick with Avon or Almay, honest companies that don't test on animals!"
1,Product is good Seller is TERRIBLE!,"This is a good product but the Seller is TERRIBLE! Never received the order! Tried sending emails with no response. Ordered a month ago and still to this day, NO PRODUCT! BEWARE OF THIS SELLER!"
1,wrong item,"Received the wrong product.Got the one without ""touch of foundation"" which I could have just bought here (I live in Barbados)"
4,Very easy to use,"The dispencer is easy to ""squeeze"" amount of moisturizer needed for one application. consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply, it's very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist UV and aging! very convenient. But just a little bit on the high side for over counter cosmetics for my opinion."
1,Feel cheated!,I thought the price was too good to be true . . . and it was. Both jars that I ordered came without the tab closure. They were each only one fourth full. Don't waste your money!
2,"Effective moisturizer, bad package","I live in northern New England, and have sensitive combination skin. At 36, I know I need a moisturizer, so I would like to maximize my time with a combo product. I really like serums, so anything that purports to do what a serum does and more (antioxidants, brightening, even skin tone) I bit. Unfortunately, my pump feature broke, and my product comes out the side! Lol, I am still using it, but what a flaw in design! Also, I have not seen any evening, brightening features, but is a good decent moisturizer. I use it at least daily, but maybe it should be used 2 times a day for maximum results."
2,Not for me.,It is just not something that I would ever buy again. I am very fair and it looks orange and streaky....and it gets on your clothes.
5,Olay Rocks!,"My mom started me on Oil of Olay products when I was in my 20's. This is probably one of the best products Olay has produced. I've used it for 2 weeks and see noticable improvements to my face, particularly around the eyes. I work with my hands have been less than gentle with them. Since using this product on my hands, my husband has commented on how soft my hands have been, and again, I can see and feel a positive difference. I bought a bottle for every woman in my family."
2,"Made my face greasy, too!","I love olay products, but this moisturizer was heavy and made my face shiny and greasy feeling--very similar to how most sunscreens feel on your face. I tried powder on top of the moisturizer to reduce the shiny look, only to find that if I touched my face (at all!) the powder would sort of roll off my face in greasy clumps. Not attractive. Needless to say, it wasn't pleasant, and I will not be using this product in the future."
1,used to work well,"I have been faithful to olay total effects and my husband is hooked to it too. Just apply and go!Lately, I have noticed more blemishes popping upand my skin looks dry and lifeliess. I guess it is time to switch!"
5,Awesome Product,I love Olay skin care but I have sensitive skin and need fragrance free products. I was having trouble finding this in the stores but leave it to Amazon to come to the rescue. Great price and great moisturizer!! Thanks Amazon!!
5,Feels great!1,"I love the Olay products, and this was no disapointment. Very creamy and smooth feeling."
1,Caused Breakouts,"I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but after 3 days of using it, I got bad breakouts all over my face. I normally have combination to oily skin, and this made my skin more oily. Disappointed."
1,Unpleasantly surprised,"I generally beleive in Olay products. Good results for the money. This product is a nice moisturizer but hasnt done anything extraordinary. I am a little surprised that it didnt give me sun prtection, i have developed freckles on the sides of my cheeks after using this product, very disappointed after a months use. Thanks for reading this review"
3,Olay Total Effects Touch of Sun,"I love Olay but this is my least favorite. It feels too thick. My favorite day cream is Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum which makes my face feel like silk and my makeup goes on smooth. At night I like Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. I use both on my face, neck and chest. I wish I had started using Olay on my chest sooner as my chest is sun damaged and looking wrinkly but my face and neck are wrinkle free at 53."
1,Dried my skin out,"So, I purchased this moisturizer because quite a few beauty recommendation sites said it was full of awesome and one of the best moisturizers out there. Excitedly, I hunted for it on Amazon, and found it. I was also pretty happy because it had a coupon so I bought it right away!My boyfriend and I both used the facial lotion for several days. Unfortunately, it managed to dry not only my skin out (I have a normal skin type which is not very sensitive) but also my boyfriend who used it also ended up with drier skin (he has dry skin type that is sensitive). I am very sad that Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer did not turn out to be anywhere near as good as the beauty recommendation sites had said it would be.Basically, be warned that this will may not work as a moisturizer. Rather, it may turn out to work as a sort of anti-moisturizer. We ended switching to Cetaphil instead."
4,Face and neck cream,"It has a very good moisturizer effect on face and neck, it also protects your skin from the sun."
1,Broke me out in hives,"I suffer from moderate acne and it was really bad for the past couple months, so I was hoping this would help it as well as help fade the red marks from past pimples. Before using this I did not think my skin was that sensitive because I never broke out into hives before. After using it once, my face was really red and three little patches of hives had broken out. I had heard such good reviews about this product I assumed it was something else that was making my face break out, so I used it a few more times and each time the hives got worse. I finally stopped using it and started using another face lotion, and after two days the hives were all gone. If your skin is even a little bit sensitive, I advise you against using this product. This was the most money I have ever spent on a face lotion, and unfortunately in this case you do NOT get what you pay for."
2,Not an all-purpose moisturizer,"I love Olay Total Effects and have been using the regular Total Effects daily moisturizer for years. After becoming unemployed recently, I was afraid I would have to give up my Olay for something cheaper. I found the subscription option at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it for at least $5 cheaper than anywhere I can find it locally. The UV SPF 15 was even cheaper than the regular, so I thought I'd give it a try. This SPF 15 variety does not feel like a moisturizer at all. It feels a little tacky/sticky going on, and it makes my face feel tight and dry. I do not normally have sensitive skin, but I felt a mild burn after using it. The smell of sunscreen is also obvious. I can see using this in the middle of summer when I'm slathering on the sunscreen anyway, but I would only use this specifically when needing extra facial UV protection...not as a moisturizer."
1,Rash!,"I wish I would have read these reviews before trying this product, though I am not sure it would have made a difference--I probably would still have bought it. I have never had a reaction to a moisturizer or sunscreen or even make-up before, but while applying my third application of this I noticed the red rash on my cheeks that others have mentioned. I've used other Oil of Olay products with no incident, and I was actually trying to switch to this from the Neutrogena anti-aging product I had been using simply because of the name brand. Didn't work.Aside from the rash, I was also not a fan of the texture of this product--it was thicker and greasier than I had expected, more of a traditional sunscreen than a moisturizer. All over disappointing."
3,Made my Face Greasy,I have normal to dry skin and this product made my skin look really oily about half way through the day. I've stopped using it for that reason. I'm really surprised that other people didn't experience the same thing.
2,To greasy,A little to greasy for me. I like a lighter cream so it doesn't feel heavy on the face. Will try something else.
5,I love Olay,"I would recommend to every and any woman who wants clear, toned, well maintained skin for years to come! I love it"
2,"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging UV Moistuerizer, SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce","This product irritated my skin so bad I had to quit using it, it was so painful.I am a senior citizen, 77 years old, and my skin is thin, sensitive, and bruises easy. This may be the reason. It may not bother younger skin."
2,"cann't be absorbed, rub off like a mask","I bought identical one with SPF before, and worked great on my skin. But this product is a disappoinment,the lotion couldn't be absorbed, like a thin mask on your face, when it's dry you can rubbed it off from your face. Very disappointed."
3,becarful it is UV 15 and it may cause burning for first 2 week,"I like UV 15 because it protect my skin and make my face white ,but titanium oxid it has causes my face burn and it take 2 week to get use to it"
2,Thick foundation with overpowering scent,I am trying out new products to find a moisturizer/foundation combo that I can wear throughout the day. I don't need a heavy foundation but just something natural and light to gently cover the flaws in my skin. I am in my late 50's with fair/medium skin tone. I have purchased several products and thought I would try them out until I find one that I like. 'Olay total effect 7-in-1 Anti-Aging' is one of the products that I recently purchased. This product is very heavy and perfumed. The coloring in this product is too intense to wear as a foundation. Therefore I plan to use it as a blush for the contour area under my cheek bones. Also I cannot use this product daily since I find that I have an allergic reaction to the strong perfume if I apply it too often. I will not purchase this product again.
1,rash rash... :(,i got a red rash on my cheek after using this. stopped using after 2days of buying this. I bought it to through in my trash can. my skin in very sensitive may be it didnt suit me.
4,Touch of Sun Made Me Break Out!!,"I love Oil of Olay products and have been using the Total Effects for a little over a year now. I decided to try to Total Effects Touch of Sun for a little color, but was disappointed to find that it made me break out. I never get blemishes, but got numerous blemishes when using this product. It also did not have much color to it anyways, but had that horrible sunless tanner smell to it. I will continue to use the original regular Total Effects, but will not use the Touch of Sun again."
4,Great Product -Great Price,Olay makes great skin care products and this is one of them. My skin has a much more youthful look after using Total Effects. The price on amazon is very competitive and on top of that I receive an additional discount by signing up to have the product shipped every 6 months. I will probably change that to every 3 months since the product has impressed me and now know that I will be using it daily. I use it after showering and apply the cream (just a little dab) while my skin is moist.
2,Never had a problem with skin cream before,"I am so bummed 'cause at first I really liked this product. However, halfway through the bottle, my skin created a bad reaction & my face broke out in a rash. The product is worth a try, but if you do have a reaction, it's also a waste of money. : ("
5,"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer, SPF 15","I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it's unscented. (Hurrah, if I want perfume, I prefer what I use!) I've been very happy with it ever since. It's not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it. If you wear make-up it'll go over the moisturizer with no problem. The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I don't look my age! (85) I don't wear make-up except for eyes and mouth, so what people see is what's there, wrinkles and all.Recommend highly."
4,Good Overall Moisturizer,"For me, this has been a great all around moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and appreciate that this lotion does not have a greasy feel or make break out."
2,Very strong sunscreen-type smell,"I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF. I've been using Ole Henricksen's ""truth revealed super creme SPF 15"", which is $55 a jar. Well, you definitely get what you pay for. The smell of this ""unscented"" cream is so chemically (is that a word?) and sunscreeny, that it's almost unbearable to wear. It is thick, so only a little bit is needed, but it isn't fully absorbed by my skin. My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell (I don't want it to cross-contaminate into my blush/powder foundation). I will not purchase again."
4,Every little bit helps,I am 73 and I have abused my skin with a lot of sun for many decades.Total effects does not work miracles but it does soften the creases in my face a little. My wife tried it and now prefers it to the good quality olive oil she used to use.
1,Very Disappointed,"I've used many Oil of Olay products before, and was excited to try this one. The first few days, people commented on my skin looking fresh and dewy, however, after the first week I noticed small red bumps starting to appear on my cheeks, and my skin becoming itchy and irritated. I stopped using it after two weeks, hoping that this was just a phase of the product I would have to endure, but alas, my skin just got worse. I went back to my Aveeno lotion, and my skin calmed down after a few days. I will never buy this product again, it was so uncomfortable having itchy skin on my face, knowing that were I to scratch it, I would only make it worse."
3,good product,"typical face moisturizer. Does the hydrating job, but doesn't really seem to fix anything when it comes to signs of aging"
3,Be careful...,"I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash. My skin is not super sensitive and I've never once had a reaction to a moisturizer/sun screen before. I would STRONGLY suggest testing on a small area unless you're okay with risking walking around with a nasty rash for a couple of days. I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.I understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn't think it would be fair to give this item one star. I don't believe it's the product's fault that my skin couldn't handle it, and like I said, it did work well everywhere else. I ordered other Olay products at the same time as this and have used them without incident."
1,Olay Total effects 7 in one Moisturizer,This is not my favorite product from Olay. I love all of the others I have tried. It is toooo sticky. I do not recommend.
4,Sticky- Edited 11/25,"I needed a new face moisturizer and figured I might as well get something to treat/prevent wrinkles as I'm not getting any younger. This product is very moisturizing- I notice with just about a weeks' use that my skin doesn't feel as parched or look as flaky. I use it at night after I shower. I could never apply in the morning just before doing my makeup. I wouldn't say it's greasy- ""sticky"" is the best word I can come up with. I don't recommend it if you have oily/combination skin. It really has NO fragrance, though.Edit 11/25: I've been using this for about a month and a half and had to come back and edit my review. While I still find it sticky- the other benefits far outweigh a little stickyness. I've made this a Subscribe and Save item I love it so much. I added a star to my review! I look forward to using it each day. My skin is smoother in texture and I notice fewer lines on my forehead. I tell my friends about this and would recommend it to anyone with normal-dry skin."
5,Keeper!!!,"I change a lot of creams from different brands from $70.00-15.00, and stoped on thus one because its just working form me it does whatever I expected from my cream to do. I might give 5 start and some 1 start stuff like this is very personal. so, u have to try first to find out if it will work for u or not. I love it and will buy over and over!"
2,Not nearly as good as Regenerist Touch of Color,"Why did you stop making the Regenerist Touch of Color? This is not the same, at all. It goes on so thick, ugh. I really can't stand it. After 20+ years of wearing Olay, this poor product had me switch to another brand. :-("
1,Doesn't Work...,The Kawasaki Sports walkie talkie does not work. Plain and simple does not work. We tried a few of these and all we ended up with was static. You could not hear the other person while speaking. Only way to hear someone was to be right next them and speak loudly over the static. Kinda defeated the purpose. Don't waste your time and money.
1,Don't bother,"Did not work AT ALL. Not at close range, not in any way we could think of to try to get them to work. Of course if you are looking to disapoint your kids and make them cry than they are a smashing success."
1,0 STARS! SHAME on these companies for selling JUNK!,"Imagine the utter dissapointment my kid (and I) experienced when we discovered that these do not work well at all! The audio is inaudible, and I can hear interference (from a radio station?) when these are on. Moreover, there is no volume control either. I can remember back in the 70's and 80's when even kids' basic, inexpensive walkie-talkies were quality, and actually worked well. It seems that these days, so many products have been cheapened to the point where they actually don't work AT ALL! These companies that 'cut corners' like this should be ASHAMED of themselves for ripping people off, and dissapointing so many in the process. There should be law suits against them."
1,Junk!,"My son got one for his birthday from a friend. It did not work at all, and when I say it did not work means that there was radio silence!Please do not buy, and this is the worst you can give as a birthday present!"
3,Staples,Did not work as expected had some problems with them as they were not what was need for the specified job.
5,Buen Libro...,"Me parece un buen libro motivacional, lo recomiendo pues nos ensena a que siendo perseverantes podemos alcanzar nuestras metas y superar cualquier obstaculo de la vida...."
1,Will not install,"I have all the minimum requirements and the game refuses to install. I read the release notes, disabled my second monitor; no luck.The support web site no longer exists.The game web site no longer exists.They appear to have taken the $$ and run. Thank goodness the game was not a $50 purchase!"
1,Will not run after install (OpenGL Error),"I wish I had read these reviews before buying it. It won't run. Complains about OpenGL. Luckily, I bought it on clearance for $8.As reviewer on another site said, ""this is a beta release in a box."""
2,HYPE ALERT,"This game seems to be getting the full treatment from the shadow marketing crew. Be careful about what reviews you put any trust in.The game is ok as a console port. It is not much of a game from PC standards. Good graphics do not make a game. It is also very short. (one day short). If you really love Vin Diesel and Riddick then you will want this, but otherwise it is not that great. I have to believe any of the over enthusiastic reviews are company plants. The reviews in the major magazines are also overly optimistic. I had minor crashes and the save game system is somewhat console-ish. Be wary of the other reviews."
3,"A so-so game, when I got it to work..","The game is designed to run on Windows XP machines with Svc Pack 1 ONLY. I was getting a big fat GPF when I tried to run the game on a non-Svc Pack 1 machine.Now that I can play the game, it is merely OK. The graphics are very good but the gameplay contains alot of the Doom-style ""find the key"" type of missions. Those get really tedious after a while."
1,Doesn't recognize my OpenGL,This really chaps my hide. I make a point of only buying games where the demo works on my box (and I like it). The demo runs fine on my 2.6GHz pentium with GeFOrce Nvidia MX6200.But the full program won't run. It says I need to have OpenGL 1.3 or better. Duh - I have drivers for OpenGL 2.0! Of course - I can't get my money back - company policy.Grrrr.
5,One of my all time favs!,"This was a great game. The gameplay is similiar to half life instead of you fighting aliens you are battling your way out of prison and on the way you must confront psychotic inmates and often have to ""take them out"" as well as hot shot powerfreak corrections officers who are just as ""bad"" as the prisoners. Loads of fun and intersting dialogue awesome voice acting and sound all in an action packed FPS make this game a gem. Only downfall about this game is that it is a little too short I finished it in 4 days but it is still well worth your money if you decide to buy it. I wish theyd make more of these prison type games."
4,Unique direction,"Try this if you are tired of generic shooters. This does get a bit tiring in it's repetetive last act, but overall the gameplay and even repetition itself are of a different nature then all other shooting games, substituting the easy way out most fps developer's take being non stop quick kills of indulgement, for an actual atmospheric, grime soaked suspense game.."
3,"Very fun, but extremely violent","An extremely fun game, I played it through in one sitting. The system requirements are steep, but if your system can handle it the graphics are outstanding, as well as the art work. The story is also interesting (though a little frustrating at times).I'm a fan of first-person shooters, and so are my children. I try to keep them away from the most violent games, but in general, most aren't too bad, despite the 'M' ratings. But I was a little shocked at the violence and language in ""Escape From Butcher Bay"", and think that it should have a stricter rating.In summary, a fun and entertaining game, but beware the violence."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money! I clipped them onto the rockers, started the motor and they all fell off. So I thought, maybe I needed to compress the clips first, gave them a little squeeze, put them back on the rockers again. Started the motor, same result, they all fell off just like before...what a piece of junk!"
3,Megan,Of the three in the series I thought it was best but I was not reallly insterested in the series of three books. Theywere just o.k.
4,good book,this was the first of the seriers I read. I believe if I would have started with the first of the serier (Women of Prinrose Creek) I would have enjoyed it more. I will oreder the other books in the series and would recomend this book to friends.
2,Annoying hum,"Looked good, sounded good. Then I noticed the low-volume hum (60 Hz?) coming from the bass ports on the back. The lower you turn the volume, the louder the hum, though it was always very subtle. The more I tried to ignore it, the more annoying it became.Repositioning the unit had no effect, nor did moving the cord or antenna or trying different modes (CD, radio, aux). The power cord has a two-pronged plug, and there was no way to ground the unit to see if that would solve the problem.Since this was to be used right next to the bed and normally played at low volume, the hum was unacceptable, particularly at the price of this radio. Paying shipping to return the radio has also left a bad taste in my mouth.Very disappointing."
4,Great Product,"This originally struck my eye as a nostalgist piece of electronic furniture. From its retro-era looking speaker covers right down to its mind blowing performance, this stereo is perfect for any any room.It provides enough volume to fill a small office, the kitchen, or even the garage. I would call it an all-in-one package. You can play CD's, listen to the radio, and even plug your ipod into the input jack if need be. But the thing I like most about this stereo is that it feels like it's stright out of the 60's. The analog clock has a color changing illuminating light which surrounds it and gives it a little pizazz.All in all I would recommend this clock/alarm/CD player/ ""ham radio"" to whomever is looking for a good price and a better product."
4,"Great sound, great quality","It feels heavy and very well made. It has great sound, simple controls and overall one of the best table clock radios/CD around. My only complaint is, it does not offer a digital tuner, my reason for taking away a star."
2,Great sound -- weak CD player,"I've had this unit for about 8 months. It looks and sounds great. I mostly bought it for the CD player -- I put a CD in when I go to bed. About a month ago the CD player began to have problems. It began to play CDs with a very noticeable ""vibrato"" effect. In the past month it's gotten worse, and now the player seems to lose its place, stop playing for a few seconds, then start up again. At this point the CD player really isn't usable.The radio still sounds great. I still have CD players from the 80s that still work fine, so this might just be a once-in-a-million problem, but it's a bother."
4,great product for immunocompromised patients-but no pump!,"This product was recommended by my doctor after he found MRSA in my nasal passages. It is what surgeons use to ""scrub up"". However you will have to find the pump that fits the bottle and buy it (with extra for shipping of the pump http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V89QME/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ) from another seller. The cleanser is great. I use it in the shower and next to the sink. Just wish I hadn't had to go looking for the pump elsewhere! But a must have if you have cancer or other immune problems. I'm told it kills stuff that grocery store antibacterial hand soaps don't."
5,The Best,"Highly effective antibacterial soap when used properly. Played a key role in clearing my MRSA colonization, which was causing serious skin problems. I lathered head to toe, then waited two full minutes before rinsing off, twice a day for a month. Combined with doctor-prescribed antibiotics. Worked."
4,This product clears complexion,I bought this for my son. He is 20. His face looks pretty radiant now that he is using the product. I could not help but notice.
1,Naturtint golden blond,"Just want to let you all know I DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT!!! I thought why not give it a try it is natural. Well it does not have the smell like other hair dye that was nice. But the color is AWFUL!!! I am going to have to re-dye it with my old color just so I can stand to look at myself in the mirror. The color is brassy and just not (natural) at all. Another thing I did not like is the way my hair felt after using it, it felt corse and dry even after using the conditioner that was included. It is back to the Balsom by Clairol for me."
3,Great account of the fight for justice in young Mexico,"This book is a short version of The Conquest of New Spain. In the Brief account, de las Casas explains the violence and injustice in which the natives were being treated by the spanish conquistadores. De las Casas writes this account to show the king in Spain the way the army was trating the indians. It also shows the courage of the clergy to protect the rights of the oppressed. De las Casas became the first bishop of Chiapas, the same area in conflict today in southern Mexico where the Church keeps fighting for justice for the poor."
4,An insightful book,"Bartolome was a priest in the new world and the book in an attempt to show the abuses that the Spaniards committed against the indians and the damages done in the name of Gad and the King. This book is a historiography, but well written and a quick read. It presents a new facet of the conquest and is a direct contrast to the writings of Cortes."
4,Like,Order for my husband. He enjoyed reading this book. He is very interested in history and found that it was very informative.
3,for history buffs only,This is from a person who was a reliable witness to the horrible treatment done to the people in South America and throughout Central America by Europeans. A tough read but vital to knowing the evil men do eachother.
1,this book is terrible,"do not buy this book i was forced to read it for school it is soo boring. please take my advice do not waste your money , if you want to read a good book read A rasin in the sun, by lorainne hansberry it rules!"
1,Not rugged enough,"We bought these for use at amusement parks. Most places will just give you ICE. Having the the water bottles and the fanny pack is FABULOUS.These are just not durable enough. We started seeing a tear in where the pack is sewn into the strap. All you have to do is bend over to pick something up and the seam rips. Out pops the wallet, sunblock and whatever else you've put in the fanny pack. We bought several. Most ripped. Look elsewhere, get a better built product. It's just too light weight."
2,Un poco desepcionado,"Este disco me suena a que fué editado solamente para tratar de seguir con la saga, pero no funcionó, alguna canción me gustó, aún no lo puedo definir bien, pero en ralidad con esto finaliza para mi Angeles del infierno. No vale la pena seguir comprando musica de esta calidad"
2,I don't think it's worth it,"This is a one CD collection of mostly boring organ and trumpet music. There's a few lively pieces that might make this worth the purchase though if you can get it cheap (I got it for five dollars) but you probably heard these pieces anyway. Plus the recording quality is pretty bad and it was recorded in a church. What do you expect though?,it's indy music."
2,You have the wrong title of this movie! It's Under Oath!,"For starters you have the wrong title listed for this movie! it's called ""under oath"" not ""urban justice""!This movie is about two cops who have to track down a killer. There are few twists and turns along the way. The DVD is very bare bones!! It has a few trailers of other movies besides this movie! This DVD also has a very bare bone actor bio on it!! Also it's not closed captioned like most DVD's are!!Jack Scalia does his best in this B grade cop movie!! Rent it first before you buy it!!"
3,Triple Action Knife,"I have been a fan of Cold Steel knife company for over 15 years. This is the first knife that did not live up to the companies reputation of tough and dependable knives. I carried a Voyager model for years and was extremly happy with its performance. I have had other models that proved very dependable. Using the performance of the other models I went with the Triple Action. Within just a few opening and closing cycles the knife was starting to become ""loose"". The portion of the handle that pivots will not reliably stay closed. I have found that if I carry it in my right back pocket, with the pivoting handle against the seem of my pocket it stays closed. I have no doubt that the blade is made of the same quality steel that I am used to so I went ahead and gave it 3 stars."
1,GARBAGE would rather have burned a$100 bill,"Stay away from this at all costs. I wrote a review over a week ago and its still not posted yet, Thanks amazon i hope no one else wasted there money on this junk in that time. anyway the knife lasted less than 10min and it fell apart. the bolt that locks the blade came loose and fell out. very very very poor quality, dull blade, cast aluminum handle. save yourself the money and buy some cheapish knife from wallmart."
1,"Nope, definately pass on this one.","Don't bother with this one. Waist of time. Irritating characters and lame story. he's 42 she's 25 and friends with his son. Father, & son using girl as a kissing toy to take pot shots at each other. She seems upset but then sigh she forgives them (blah). Brief moments of backbone and then (sob) she's kissed and forgets to be mad(Barf).Seriously though sarcasm aside; of the many I have read this one was not worth my time or money. The characters had potential but they were so contradictory that their actions were confusing and irritating. The heroine had moments of promise and backbone, but then she would become this naive basket case. It was a big contradiction. All in all the book was a sore disappointment and I wish I hadn't muddled my way through it. Should have gone with my gut and tossed it after the first few chapters."
4,"Simple, Stark, But Beautiful & Creative!","Marc Bessange has produced a collection of black & white male semi-nude photos here that are simple, yet beautiful and creative in there presentation. There are no props, fantasy settings, fetish images. There are just good-looking, young, masculine males who seem very relaxed before the camera. These are reality shots of these male models, posing the way they want, in a natural way. There is no frontal nudity, and I believe this makes these poses even more sensual than if they were nude. These guys either have attitude or they don't, it is up to them. This is to Bessange's credit that he lets his models take control, and be themselves in all of his work. This is a fine collection from a very talented photographer. The cover photo is one of my favorites, and I think you will enjoy this collection. Check it out!Joe Hanssen"
3,The Truth,"Okay - Even I'll admit it - ""Purple Hills"" does undeniably have a catchy beat and a cool music video. But did you really believe that a song featuring Eminem could really be as harmless as this? Neither did I.So I checked the lyrics. The real song is called ""Purple Pills"" - yes, you guessed it, a drug-infused single about tesing different drugs and helping your mother who's just swallowed a handful of Valium into bed. Sick. It may even seem funny, but not to the eight year olds who watch MTV with their sibs.Parents, I realize that you think this song is harmless. Have you heard the lyrics? They seem totally out of place! It's not ""I've Run The Highest Mountain"" in the chorus line, it's ""I've Run Up Mushroom Mountain"". haha.Nothing compares to these blue and yellow purle lies. Cya."
3,Some explanations could not be trusted.,"This book is announced as for reference and fun, but some explanations could not be trusted.and it kills both reference and fun."
3,"Interesting, but not what I expected","While this is a good read, but I was expecting something more along the lines of ""throw salt over your shoulder"" or ""don't cross the path of a black cat."" I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old son, who enjoys learning interesting facts, but this book is not at all geared toward kids, even teenagers. He can read it just fine, but it's dry and boring. I'm keeping it for myself, then I can share some of the ""cooler"" stuff with him myself."
4,Interesting Short Read,Bought this as a Christmas gifts for family. I found myself reading it several times before we wrapped it. Very interesting information. Fun read
3,Interesting but could be better,"This an interesting read and easy to reference. But with a little more effort this could be a great book. A few of the ""explanations"" seem a little far fetched to me, but I won't make too big of a deal out of that. I just think some very obvious common words and phrases were left out. Maybe there were no good explanations found; but it makes the book feel incomplete. There are also a lot of obscure words and phrases that I had never heard of; it seemed to be focused on a British audience perhaps. In spite of these things though the book has been a fun-read and will be a handy reference in the future. It's a keeper."
5,Why Do We Say It.,We gave this book as Christmas gifts. A lot of informationabout things. Makes you think. Couldn't put the book down.
2,Why do we say it,Ratger too sterile and void of detail and cleverness. Lacked touch of an author who was in love with language.Too brief .
5,cool,"this is so interesting and the alphabetical order lets you look up phrases simply. so cool and although it was classified ""used"" it looked brand new!"
1,Not what I had hoped for,"We bought this book as a gift. It was recommended as a companion to Dictionary of Word Origins. When our son opened the two separate gifts and started comparing the books, they were the same book with a different cover. Not a companion book at all."
5,Sea Change by Ian Dickens,"Apart from having the wrong accreditation for the author - it is not by Ellen McArthur. The book was very well written, perhaps as it should be. The author being being the great grandson of the famous Charles Dickens. A very realistic and gripping description of a Round The World race participant, factual, emotional and a very, very good read. Difficult to put down. Brilliant reading."
2,The title on the CD does not agee with the title on the jacket.,"When the CD is added to I-Tunes, the title comes up differently than the Album title. This makes it confusing to search for the album. Also, Amazon's description of the album listed Craig Duncan as the artist. The CD gives only generic artists. This also makes it difficult to search for the album by artist. The songs listed are the same, but is this the same album or some previous version? I-Tunes identifies this album as ""Country Mountain Hymns - Volume 2"", and the artists as ""Country Mountain Hymns""."
1,Bad very bad....,"the worse purchase than I have made via amazon... very desilucionado, the mesh is very very short... seems for woman, ademas of pesima quality of the same one. seems bought in the street... I have bought 8 clocks in amazon... and was the unico that I am from bad excellent quality. demas... this very bad quality. not as much the same maquina but the mesh... I do not recommend it..."
1,Total failure,"I constructed a counter top of end grain hard maple. The end grain is the work surface; the joints are all flat grain. After a few months, in the area where the top is used most, all joints are failing. Examination under magnification shows that the glue simply softened. The top was thoroughly saturated with mineral oil. (General Finishes.) Either water or food or cleaning agents (I use Fantastic) caused total failure of the glue. After this experience, I won't use this glue for anything and will probably shift to something other than a Franklin product for quick glue jobs. All critical jobs will be done with epoxy."
2,combo table comment,"I was quite disappointed with my table, not only was the dinning table/ ping pong top was busted on one of the corners, the bed of the table is not level at all it has dips and high points at least an 1/8"" high, the rails were practicaly ditches the balls will roll down the whole lenght of it and fall right in with little effort and if you get the ball anywhere near the corner and they will roll right in. Should have known better than to buy anything made in china if they are willing to posion our pets and kids, i shouldnt have thought they're quality control is to tight on billiard tables, been better off paying the extra 25% and just got a good american or european product, Lesson Learned!"
1,This case is wack.....,"As the previous person wrote, this case is not a battery case. It is cheaply made and barely stays closed when it's full of batteries."
5,Fantastic and Needed,"Reader friendly ideas, readily accessible components (did that other reviewer ever shop?), clever humor, and old fashioned common sense combine in this book to give you all the best tools for handling those inevitable ""bad days""Telesco has gone where few writers dare to tread by handling the concept of using magick as a warrior or a weapon in a direct, adult manner. This book doesn't advocate violence, but it doesn't promote the ""poor me"" syndrom eitehr.Bravo!"
2,How to be a witch,"[...]This book is extremely helpful for those interested in Wicca and the Craft. It gives you tips on how to tell your parents of your interest and how to answer the questions they'll have. It also gets you started on your Book of Shadows. Telesco gives you a few sample spells and rituals to get you started and to put in your Book.

1,disappointed from the whole series,"I am more than disappointed. The content of the DVD is absolutely of no help. Says nothing more than trivia. And people like me paying a fortune to collect dvd's like that, waiting them eagerly, just to find out that some guy with no scientific credentials, appearing on the screen just to sympathize (which i do not doubt, sincerely) and say that we should eat healthy foods and get a good sleep, after repeating a hundred times:""i will reveal to you my secret formula, 100% guarantee blah,blah,blah'. Really, bying this dvd was something i have clearly regreted and undermined my intelligence."
2,Details,"I wont get too far into this video, there are plenty of reviews already for it but I would like to go on the record by stating just one thing. If your not a die hard Dead Space fan, leave this one alone. As for the people giving it a five star rating I can only assume they must be fanboys/fangals of the series to have overlooked simple details. Just as one prime example in one of the story tracks a man of the African-American persuasion is grieving over the tragic loss of his daughter, who is represented as an Asian girl for roughly 90% of his story who is then transformed into an African-American girl. Its small details like this that offset the viewing enjoyment, and its not the only one. But overlooking magical racial flips this is a filler with no direct story content to the games or any of the lore other than the Marker and its effects really. Hope this helps."
5,awesome movie.,a great movie if you like dead space or even if you like horror movies. it was an awesome movie. i loved every minute of it
1,I hate it,"It did not have that same grit as the first one. It was not drawn, it was done on a computer, which took away from it in my opinion."
3,"True to story line, but the imagery is a little too cartoony.","A must own for the die hard Dead Space fan.This animated full-length feature is full of blood, guts and suspense, just as you would expect from all things DS.The story picks up where the video game Dead Space 2 leaves off. On Aegis VII, a scouting team from the O'Bannon is dispatched to recover pieces of the Marker, and everything falls apart beginning with the very first exposure.We finally see how planet crackers (like the USG Ishimura) actually excavate continent-sized pieces of planets, during the mining process.Follow an all-new set of characters in the familiar life and death struggle against the outbreak. Watch how any threat can come from anywhere.Release date: 1/25/2011 [78 Minutes]"
2,Sci-fi animation based on the video game,"Before I start the review of this product I need to disclose that I am not familair with the video game this animation is based on. I have picked up the movie because I am not a fan of sci-fi. Sci-Fi animation can sometimes enahance the imaginary sense of the experience.With that being said, I must say that the animation (effects) are fairly low quality and not particularly impressive. The story line may make more sense for anyone who is familiar with the game. I was not shaken up by it.This movie anumation will kill a couple of hours in your day but it will not leave you in awe and provide you unforgetable experience. With that being said, that may just be enough fro anyone spending a lonely night at home with nothing better to do. It beats the re-runs on your favorite movie cable channel."
4,Dead Space Aftermath,"Dead Space: Aftermath was fairly entertaining, even though I've never played the game or had any other introductions into anything related to Dead Space. I did enjoy the story for the most part, though it seemed somehwat incoherent and vague in details from time to time. I thought the different animation styles used for the various character's flashbacks were really well thought out.The DVD has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, which in my opinion was very well implemented, blending seamlessly with the movie for an overall excellent experience that helps pull the viewer into the the story.I do wish this movie had been rated, or at least had a label warning of the nude content and strong language used in the animation. Anyone not familiar with what Dead Space is would probably be in for a surprise if they just bought it on a whim for their children."
3,WAS ALRIGHT...,"The cover fools me into thinking it was as good as the first one. Though it got my attention, overall it was ok. I would still watch it again, but the animation sucked like Transformers: Beast Wars type of thing. The story line was just through 4 people's different points of view on what occurred after arriving on the contaminated ship. Would I recommend it? Meh, maybe you are better off getting Dead Space: Downfall than this one honestly."
3,Just why?,"Love Dead Space and anything having to do with it, but JUST WHY??!! Is the question I ask every time I see the 3d in this movie! It's on par with giving the worst program to the worst set of middle schoolers that tried 3d for the first time and someone's kid was promised it would be in the movie as a favor! *anger*, but the 2d on the other hand was amazing! Loved the 2d and the story was decent. If you find it cheap here buy it. It's worth it just to laugh at the 3d with friends when your drunk or sober..."
3,Animated Movie For Fans of the Game,"Dead Space Aftermath is a full-length animated movie version of the game by the same name. Set in the year 2509, this is the story of the four surviving members of the USG O'Bannon. The animation and graphics are okay. The characters are interesting enough. The only problem is the profanity, which makes it unsuitable for many viewers who might be demographically suited for this film. (The profanity is excessive and doesn't add to the dialogue.)So for that reason and that reason alone, I can't recommend it. There is a parental caution warning at the beginning of the film, but it's definitely rated R material, not for kids or even young teenagers, unless parents are condoning the use of lots of profanity.And by the way: there are plenty of older people who are into animation but are not into profanity for the sake of filling up dialogue."
4,Enjoyable Space Adventure,"Let me start this off by explaining that I have never played the game this movie is based on,but I enjoy animated films and space adventures,so I wanted to see this.The animated feature starts off with a spaceship coming upon another ship from their fleet called the USG O'Bannon that only has a lot of dead bodies in it and four survivors,the movie Alien was written by Dan O'Bannon,so I thought I knew where this was headed.There's a lot of action in this film with a lot of violence and tons of swearing like you would expect in an R rated movie.Over all I enjoyed this 75 minute adventure but I felt like I would have had more fun with it if I'd known the game it was based on.The animation was good with an exciting soundtrack with great voice actors and there never was a dull moment.It's made me want to play the game now,"
5,"Dead Space: Aftermath, ""GREAT MOVIE""!","This movie ties Nolan Stross into the Dead Space 2 video game (and it actually makes sense, versus tie-ins of characters from Dead Space: Downfall to Dead Space (1) video game; not knocking Dead Space: Downfall at all - great movie also, just saying). Deserves 5 Emmy-Academy Awards? Not reeeally, but it's a spectacular watch!"
1,Good going you CGI morons....,"Like others have said, the mix of different animations in this movie are just down right annoying. One scene has great movie like CGI, then next one has some cartoon network junk, then some, etc... its really annoying and hard to concetrate on the movie itself. I have not played the game but I watched the first movie and really liked to gore, language, and plot, etc.. animation/CGI could have been better, but this one, is just plain horrible... I still like the idea of the movie, but the lame animations just ruined it. I stopped watching after about 5 minutes..."
1,Why was this made?,"This movie did not need to be made, it was honestly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, not only was the plot nonsensical, but the random animation changes are strange as hell. Please, do not rent or buy this movie, just like dante's inferno this is EA cashing in on a franchise's success."
1,"bad animation, crappy story, studio cash grab","4 survivors of the shard are being interrogated about what happened in the past. The movie is computer animated during the present ""animations"" and hand drawn to show the stories being played out.This movie was awful, cruddy computer animation, characters completely changing in appearance from scene to scene so you can't tell who is who, overblown profanity and no point at all to the story are only minor setbacks to a movie with almost no redeeming qualities.I wish at least the artwork had been halfway descent... but as it is, there isn't really an reason to watch or especially buy this film. Sadly the voice actors gave it their all... but there wasn't much for them to salvage here. I can't think of any reason to but this as it appears to be nothing more than a studio cash grab for people under the influence of the title."
2,Meh...,"While this wasn't a horrible experience, it wasn't anything spectacular. The plot's kinda rough and the CGI was pretty bad, making it seem like a rush job. The overall artwork was just okay, with some parts greatly detailed and some very mediocre.I'm not against profanity, but there was a whole lot of swearing and the ""F-bomb."" This is strictly a tie-in to the game and would seem confusing to the average viewer looking for a sci-fi flick. If you watch this with no expectations, then it'll be okay. Otherwise, you're going to be disappointed."
3,Video Game Spin-Off for Adults,"While I've not experienced the video game ""Dead Space,"" I found this U.S./South Korean animated production to be a passable time passer . . . sorta. With a reasonably good storyline about a malevolent alien intelligence being captured on a doomed planet (shades of ""Alien""), the film holds up reasonably well, told through flashbacks of four survivors of the mission. Unfortunately, the film falls flat with excessive violence, bad language (the ""F-bomb"" is dropped regularly throughout the 78 minute running time), and surprising and unnecessary nudity and sex in a short sequence. This isn't your father's old time cartoon animation, to be sure, and one wonders what target audience the producers had for this film. I suspect that those who are familiar with and regularly play the video game will enjoy this film, as well as those who enjoy animation. All others, proceed at your own risk."
1,Terrible movie in every way!! a complete mess.,"i'll make this short and sweet(? kind of). lol. the 1st DEAD SPACE movie was really good, gory, had a good story and identifiable cool characters. this sequel is the antithesis of that. this was SUCH a huge disappointment. mixing extremely poor CGI with cartoon format was beyond stupid and very jarring. the story is a jumbled mess. just blech. i give this a 1 out of one and i hate doing that. i was SO excited for this movie and it just sucks."
1,Terrible,"This is a poor excuse for a movie. I watched the entire film in the hope that it would actually progress in some fashion. I was mistaken. The animation was poorly done and simplistic. The story, or rather stories, were just rehashes of the individual's experiences from the original movie. There was very little new material. I'm stretching a single star rating here, but if you've never seen the original you might get a tiny bit of enjoyment from this. Terrible. Simply terrible."
2,Ok,"I had not played the video game that this story comes from so looked at it as a standalone movie.Decent characters. Decent setting. Decent storyline. The real weakness for me was the monsters. I thought they would be more effective as typical zombies (in space) rather than the way movies often try to portray Lovecraft type monsters as endless tentacles.Not bad to watch on a lazy afternoon, but not a great movie either."
4,Worth a good listen,"To compare music and things in general is pointless. There is always something different(better) depending on your own personal scale of what is good. I like these guys. There is an awful lot of European music that I missed when it was released, but I now have the chance to hear it. The 20 dollar price tag will discourage most and I think a more reasonable price would help sell it. Well recorded, especially considering the 1976 release. Give it a shot."
3,"same ol, same ol","Pitbull Daycare kinda reminds me of a cross between Alien Sex Fiend, Christian Death, and Nine Inch Nails. These guys are completely unroiginal and only marginally talented. What else can you expect from the cleopatra label? oh well.....at least i have a new drink coaster, and a fun drinking game where i can annoy the hell outta my drunk friends by playing this cd"
1,Terrible!!!!,I could only get through half the album it was so terrible.Nothing on this CD shows talent.Just alot of noise with no melody.
3,"average, even by todays weak standards","this album by pitbull daycare is really not good. Their sound, is way too borderline nu-metal with techno influences. to sum it up these songs sound dated, like they couldve come from 1998 or 2000, (think ""Dope - felons and revolutionsaries"")and i just heard this album last week (2/05). it's not that this band sucks but the singers vocals just dont do it for me, they bring down the whole album. save yourself the money and buy a society 1 album."
1,Poor quality tape,"I looked forward to receiving this video tape. It contained many older commercials that would have been interesting if the tape quality was better. Unfortunately, the video tape was almost unviewable due to extreme amount of ""snow"" and interference. It is tood bad that the poor quality of the tape prevented viewing it at its best."
1,VERY Poor Quality!,"yes, i agree. this tape was of very poor visual & audio quality. don't waste your money on this one folks. i'm not sure who to blame, AMAZON or the company who made the video, at any rate i will be sending this tape back pronto. in addition to that, most of the ""classic"" commercials are from the mid 1970's & 80's which in my opinion don't really qualify as ""classics"". i was looking for a tape w/ commercials from the 50's & 60's, which this had none of. this was truly disappointing."
5,Great Stuff,"I feel like I'm in hog heaven when I listen to this. There is something fun, but soothing about this old-time jazz. When you think of it, this music was created often in the worst of times (Depression) but, boy, did it sing! You could tell the musicians were having a blast playing together. It's contagious."
3,PIANISTIC QUERY,"It would be interesting to know who is playing ""Flashes"", In the Dark"" and Candlelights"", because although Bix composed them, he never wrote them down, nor did he record them. I have not bought this item, but my three stars is based on what looks at best like an honest mistake, but if you're going to compile a Bix CD then you should know what you're doing!"
2,Total Knee Replacement,I didn't realize when I made my purchase that this book's copyright was so old. I will pay more attention to this next time. I think that medical science changes too quickly to rely on old information.
3,Helpful..except for some of stretches,"As a rehab therapist, I would use Active Isolated Stretching/Strengthening: the Mattes Method for rehab exercises..never a static hold on tight/scar tissue. Because proper rehab is so important, I have to take 2 stars away!"
3,Good pre-op OK post-op little info on Bilateral,I was looking for a book that could offer additional rehab workouts and excersises for bi-lateral knee replacements. I was also looking for informaton geared toward an athletic lifestyle. I am a very active 59 year old who beat up his knees over 50 years of playing sports and finally needed both knees replaced. This book offers little additional information that I had not received from my surgeon and nothing that fit my particular needs in returning to a very active life.The book is great for someone older or less active who is looking to get a knee replaced and for someone who's surgeon didn't offer the range of information that mine did.The book covers the topic well but not exactly what I was looking for.
5,Get This Book If You Are Considering Knee Replacement Surgery,This book is a wonderful guide for anyone who is either considering knee replacement or has already had the surgery. Any questions and/or doubts that I had were answered clearly by this book. It is a must have for all going through this surgery.
5,FANTASTIC,"A MUST READ for anyone preparing for a total knee replacement. It provides exercises to prepare for surgery that will help the patient recuperate faster. Most importantly, it cites exercises from week one to the patient's first year and lifelong care of the tkr. I have an outstanding surgeon and physical therapist, but they do not have the time (nor have they personally experienced a joint replacement) to answer the many questions/answers that this book provides. Written by both a surgeon and a physical therapist (who had both his knees replaced) provide the reader with step-by-step information and exercies.My advice -- buy the book. It is worth every penny."
1,Terribly Dissapointed,"The authors hardly discuss knee extension directly. According to my Physical Therapists and Surgeon full knee extension post surgically is the biggest challenge faced by many TKR patients. The word ""extension"" doesn't even appear in the index. I am over 8 months post surgical and spend all of my rehab time these days working on knee extension exercises. I have to attach a ten pound ankle weight to my left leg, lay on my stomach and dangle my leg off the bed twice a day for thirty minutes. If I skip doing this exercise for even a day my knee stiffens up and becomes painful. I don't understand why this issue is not addressed and must warn anyone considering purchasing this book to know about this omission. Talk to your doctors and pt's before you purchase or follow any advise found in this book about flexion contracture and see what they have to say. I can't recommend this book to anyone."
4,very helpful information,I got this book just before having a total knee replacement. I didn't have time to read as much as I would have liked before the surgery but what I did get to helped me to understand why I would feel the things I felt afterward. It is a great tool for rehabilitation and everything in it matches what my physical therapist tells me. It is written to fit just about every situation. The exercises are clearly explained with photos to help. Great books for anyone having a total knee replacement.
4,This book reinforced everything my surgeon Said!,"A great help to keep you on track with your Total knee rehab and recovery! This book is a realistic manual for time lining goals and expectations after surgery, and gives invaluable information about exercise and pain management! It helped me understand what was going on in the healing process!"
5,Highly recommend,"This book is a great resource to have beginning with your decision to have the surgery through physical therapy and home rehab. I recently had TKA surgery and this book answered a lot of my small-medium questions, especially helpful because my Dr. is a great technician but lacks bedside manner. A physical therapist friend of mine found it thorough and accurate. Highly recommend."
4,Does the Job,Compares to gorilla wood glue. Price/Value is decision maker. I recommend this product for most woodworking projects. I use it for all woods and has good holding.
4,"Thinner than tighbond 1 and 2, 3 flows into crevices","I bought tightbond 3 for bonding a number of miter cut joints - I found it was thinner than preferred (2 or 1 version) but there was a surprising use I had not considered before - sometimes wood will split even after you pre drill and countersink for a screw and you find these little micro cracks that form after the drilling and screw head make the wood split along its natural grain lines.What I eneded up using tightbond 3 for was fixing those micro cracks - it's thin enough that I can pour it into a crack and it will wick itself in without much stuffing with a brush. Afterwards I put a clamp each way around the wood (top/bottom, left-right) and when it sets up the cracks are gone, invisible, and I can drill and run self tapping wood screws without fear of any more cracks forming after it sets up.It still works great with precision cut joints and lots of clamps but right out of the bottle things will slide a bit due to the low viscosity of TB 3"
4,maceo i want you to blow,"for p-funk, and james brown fans only if you miss the mind blowing riffs of fred, and maceo-you'll love this, if you like bootsy's thumpasaurus bass licks this is for you features the brides of funkenstein on up for the down stroke yes it's a remake but p-funk fans like myself don't mind, the best song is four play-that bumps, not a bad cd like i said this is for p-funk fans who enjoy fred wesley, maceo, and bootzilla."
4,A New Favorite,"My little horse-obsessed 4yr old loves her new book. She received several for her birthday, but this one is requested multiple times a day. It's a cute, quick read and we notice new details of the illustrations each time."
2,Didn't Like It,Not much of a story. Ending involves the little girl leaving home without an explanation. Not a good book for the little ones.
2,poor,"Don't listen to these people........the sound quality on this record is awful, awful.You see that blue sticker on the right hand corner of the cd..guess what it says ""for the Discerninglistener"".""collectors only"".....in other words hard, hard core fans. I am one and I still can't listento this album. I played it once....never buy a Gambit CD .They're awful!!"
5,A note to Razor & Tie from a TPOH fan:,"Get these guys back in the studio, pronto! I bought this disc, despite owning the 5 CDs it's culled from, as a gesture of support to one of the great lost bands of the last 15 years. I have loved TPOH from the first drumbeat of ""I'm an Adult Now"" right through the last echo of ""The Truth"". A tight, rocking band with wit and humor, TPOH deserves a listen from any fan of smart, snappy music. If you can get enough people hooked with this disc, I would suggest a re-release of their back catalogue. The world deserves a second chance to hear this stuff."
3,Not Bad,"This book is a retelling of Mansfield Park as seen through the eyes of a lady's maid named Jane Hartwell. Jane was born on Mr. Rushworth's estate and is the granddaughter of Sotherton's gardner. As she grows up, Jane is continually lamenting Mr. Rushworth's foolishness, which grows into a disdain for all the ""first"" sons of England. As she grows older, Jane goes through many misadventures, becoming Julia Bertram's maid, Henry Crawford's mistress, and then London's most acclaimed actress. The book itself is well written by Terry... However, for real fans of Mansfield Park I include several warnings: Fanny Price and Edmund Bertram are described as ""insipid"" and ""stiff""; we are asked to believe that Crawford's proposal to Fanny was meant to get back at Jane; and Tom Bertram is a would-be rapist with illegitimate children strewn across England."
2,Questionable change of authorship,"In the preface to the (translated) 1968 edition of ""The Autobiography of a Runaway Slave"" (by Esteban Montejo, edited by Miguel Barnet), Barnet describes how Montejo had recounted his life story and adds, ""Esteban soon became the real author of this book. He was constantly looking at my notebook, and he almost forced me to write down everything he said.""Though I do not own a copy of the recent edition, it is very puzzling that Barnet now lists himself as first author, followed by the translator, with Montejo's name last. Certainly the work of an editor or translator is arduous, and deserves proper credit. Yet both are distinct from the author's.It's both an irony and a shame that Barnet, who is a white member of Cuba's ruling elite, seems to have appropriated the story of a poor, black slave, whose protests and defiance more than 100 years ago would surely be considered counter-revolutionary today."
5,Misunderstood to Understood,"Great storytelling on a wide range of issues that are often misrepresented about Hispanic society in the Americas from the art of low and slow riders, to gays under conservative Catholic institutional repression, to Hispanic working class culture, to Indigenous Native people's rights."
4,Totally engaging,This movie held my interest all the way through. Pratt was excellent. The sound track is great. Brings back an old style in a new way.
5,POWERFUL and INSPIRING!,"EXCELLENT MOVIE! Just saw it tonight and had a Q & A with Benjamin Bratt's brother (Peter). The complexities, realities, and humor of the human experience are beautifully intertwined and moving. Would highly recommend it to all! :-)"
3,Slightly Touching,the movie is ok. It's not great but it's ok. nothing really exciting about it. the acting isn't that great.
3,Good one,It has a great even flow. Tells a story about a gangsta learning about his gay son. You can tell the message. Great!
5,Very Good Movies,"I just love Benjamin Bratti think he is a great actorthis movies was kind of strange but i like the very muchand i can't stop watching it.and the music to the movie, day hit it right on a noteI just love oldies if you know what i mean.Until next time Thanks.Max"
4,Excellent,"I felt the movie was a great teaching lesson to parents who may have dicovered that their son or daughter is gay. The movie shows parents that they should learn to accept the fact that they should not be homophobic. Accept the child as he or she is and move on. Love the child regardless, and things will workout so much better."
5,Worth watching,"I found La Mission well worth watching. Being completely unfamiliar with the Mission District, I learned a lot. Watching the interaction between Che and his buddies was a bit like being a fly on a wall and observing men as they are when they aren't in ""mixed company."" The love that was evident between Che and his son was well portrayed. His anger and the way he expressed it seemed believable although frightening. I thought the Aztec dancers were fascinating to watch. The end of the gangbanger who shot Jesse was predictable but well done. The film was well-directed, well-acted and beautifully photographed. Again, Benjamin Bratt shows us that he is a fine actor and, overall, has not been given enough opportunities to demonstrate that. Thank goodness for a brother who is a gifted director! Hopefully, there will be more collaborations in the future."
4,A nice diversion .. Decent story.. Great acting.!,"I had been planning to see this for months and one of my friends said, Let's watch it tonight, Together.. We Did.. A nice Diversion. Not as Deep as I had hoped. Butttt, I enjoyed it!"
4,benjamin bratts best,"this is a great movie that shows true low riders culture. ben really shined here as a father who grew up old school trying to do good by his son, who happens to be living a secret life that his father does not approve or accept. a good movie all around and ben really pushes the envelope here. 1 of his best performances ever."
5,Big heavy thrower,"For the hobby knife thrower, the Cold Steel 80TOR Torpedo Thrower can be a little intimidating. The size of this throwing implement is about 12 inches long and 2 lbs. of solid steel, about the same as a professional class throwing knife or hawk. If you are familiar with the Cold Steel large ""Bo Axe"" style throwing knives, the length and weight of the Torpedo are comparable, but concentrated into the double tapered torpedo. As with any two point thrower, the possibility of getting a good ""stick"" is doubled. This is definitely an outdoor thrower and should be used in a good protected throwing area with a sturdy target and backstop. It will definitely give your arm a workout. This is NOT a toy and should be used with responsible adult supervision. This Torpedo is exactly what it is advertised to be."
3,C'mon Bruce,"If you're a BR fan, this cd will not disappoint musically. I have to give it 3 stars though, because it only has 7 songs. Fans that support an artist expect more for their hard earned money."
1,"Great product, outrageous price!","I'm not rating this low because the bronzer is bad no, I LOVE this bronzer and have been using it for almost 2 years now, but thankfully I didn't buy from Amazon, I'm rating this bad because of the price! $50, not fair. You can get this at Macy's or the official Estee Lauder site for $32! I don't know how you're getting away with ripping people off like this, but it's not right."
4,Good but not the best,"I bought this cd sometime in December...even though I have written such a late review...a highly anticipated cd this was, it had too much hype....this is not the best of tiesto...his earlier works were better...check out Magik 6, in search series, summerbreeze...there are some nice trax on this compilation...Close to you, In my memory, Dallas 4PM, Flight 643.Overall it is not bad, but compared to Tiesto's standard's...Not His best...enjoy the cd"
4,My first of many DJ Tiesto,"This was the first DJ Tiesto CD I bought. Within 5 minutes of it on my CD player I went back and bought everything he made that I could get my hands on. DJ Tiesto is clearly one of the most talented artists in his field. I'm not a snobbish trance fan or even a connoisseur, I just like electronica and trance -- and I really like DJ Tiesto's works. It's true that the ""flow"" of this album is stuttered, so I only give it 4 or 5 stars. But it's still a great album. Don't listen to URB magazine about the title track It sounds great."
1,Sucks,"This CD is almost like the orchestra music soundtrack to a movie. Also, the beats are very amateurish. It sounds along the lines or pushing sound buttons every other beat. Highly disappointed in the CD."
4,I listened to this before an exam...,"I listened to this CD before an exam and I failed. I think Tiesto trance has subliminal messages. Go for live instrumental music instead. Try bossa nova or jazz. They are trippy too. Trance had kept me away from God, and had become my cult. I threw away all my electronica CDs and now I am happy and successful. Beware trance music."
3,Not his Best,"This CD collection by Tiesto is too mellow, not as rockin as Live in Amsterdam from his Magik tour. That CD is a MUST BUY whereas this latest is not one those awesome all day and every day play lists that I have. Skip it unless you really need to have every single Tiesto CD in your collection."
3,Too much comercial,"I dont like DJ Tiesto producing lines... he is too much comercial. Allthough sometimes he does some AWESOME stuff... as like other genious. Well, this time he failed... advice: its better waiting for the single remixes.Airwave remix of In My Memory is very good. Already out. Check it out!"
4,Not your average tiesto,"I'm a huge tiesto fan - hell i dont think i like any other DJ.This is the latest album i bought of his, although its from '01, I only just came across this in the store, along with In Search of Sunrise (1), and sampled all the tracks in both albums, chose this instead as it was different from all the other tiesto that I have (mostly Magik, In Search of Sunrise s)CD1 has an overall slower beat and is softer. Amazing tracks are Magik Journey, Battleship GreyHowever, i didn't like how he did the key track here ""In My Memory"". It pales in comparism to his version in In Search Of Sunrise 3If you did the faster, heart thumping, typical trance-techno-ish tracks, go straight to CD2.I loved CD1 and for this price, two cds are worth every penny i spent"
4,Tiesto's review,"I bought this cd not really knowing tiesto very much. I had always heard mixed feelings from people about his style of music. I must say that his style is unlike any that I have heard before. I grew up listening to the chemical Bros., Prodigy, Carl Cox,and of course digweed. I guess my review of this cd is there are acouple of songs that blow my mind and acouple fo songs that really did'nt. I guess that battle with him and oakenfold and van dyk... and digweed will always go on, but so far digweed is still the man, not tiesto...sorry"
3,a no go for hard trance fans,"Unless youre really into goa/psy trance or chill sessions this cd is not the best choice. The dutch meistro strings together a true trance journey, not exactly typical of his style. If you enjoy chillout sessions instead of the ever popular hard, progressive/ acid house/trance genres, this is a good choice. Otherwise, skip on over to the magik series!"
3,"Pretty Good, but not Great","Many of the tracks on this CD were very good, but at times the vocals got a bit cheesy. The significant exception is 'In My Memory' which uses vocals while also being one of the best tracks. With only a few exceptions, this is good trance."
1,rip off of a legend!!,"what a ripoff of a legends name and likeness!all it is are a bunch of mexican "" lucha libra"" wrestling matches. thats it,no tribute to him or his family at all. zero!, just some mexicans ripping off eddie guerrero's good name for a buck!! disgusting,trashy people only do this!!not worth getting. get the official stuff at you know where..they have all his great matches and comedy."
5,Awesome grooves by Jorge Ben Jor,"I first heard Jorge Ben Jor when I picked up David Byrne's Beleza Tropical. Live in Rio is awesome Afro-Brazilian rhythm and funk and the sound quality is excellent. Nevermind looking for his greatest hits, they're all here. Live in Rio Part II is also good but Part I is a must-have."
3,i like oye cachita,i want to buy this cd but i live in argentina.could you send me this compact disc.i have a credit card.mi address is oro 2462 6a (1425)buenos aires argentina.thank you!++
4,Cleansing Cloths,"I cut these in half to stretch them and use them when traveling, or when I just need to remove makeup. They are sudsy at first, but there is no sting. I then rinse them out, rinse my face and wipe again to remove all traces and dry my face. I think they are convenient, work well to remove makeup, and travel well. Sometimes you can even reuse them once."
4,Great Book!,"I love this lil' book! It's got loads of really great and fairly simple and inexpensive recipes! Super great for students (and anyone) who loves delicious vegetarian food on a budget :)The only small downside of this cookbook is the lack of photos. Sometimes photos make dishes appeal to me more than if there's no photo included and I have to imagine what it'd look like! But seriously it's no big deal! As a whole, this book is really really great for just about anybody looking to expand their vegetarian culinary pursuits!"
4,"Easy, delicious recipes to please any vegetarian palate.","The recipes in Student's Vegetarian Cookbook are designed for people with not much money and even less time. The recipes use easily obtained fresh and prepared ingredients and each recipe gives preparation and cooking times. The book includes a nice blend of vegan and non-vegan dishes as well as pointers on products and preparation for the beginning vegetarian. Great breakfast ideas, salads and bean dishes!"
3,Okay for beginning vegetarians,"I bought this cookbook when I began eating vegetarian. The beginning has good advice for students living in dorms for how to store vegetables and easy ways to make dishes, the actual recipies were not very tasty and I was disappointed in the few I tried. I stopped using this book for recipies and have gone on to other sources for dishes. These recipies lacked a distinctive flavor I felt like they were very bland in contrast to what I was looking for."
1,"Very basic, good if you know NOTHING about food.","I did not enjoy this cook book, I found it to be extremely basic, nothing new."
2,Really not that great...,"I bought this book in October - it is now February and I have yet to make anything out of this cookbook. I love vegetarian cookbooks and was looking for something quick and easy, but nothing in this book sounded that appetizing or that filling to me (I am not a picky eater by the way). I'm sure there are other vegetarian cookbooks out there that are way better. Skip this one."
5,Great for the only vegetarian in the house!,"I got away from my vegetarian diet about five years ago... major move, lots of stress. I tried to start back up a few times, but all the cookbooks I had or could find had recipes that were too time consuming to pull off and still feed the other non-vegetarian members of the household. This book has delicious recipes that take minimal time to prepare and have relatively few ingredients. A great buy!"
5,This one's got it all,"Carole Raymond's newest book has all the charm and wonder and ease of her first cookbook that had some of us actually looking forward to packing our children's lunches. This book is not just for students. Or cheap cooks. It is for anyone who loves the adventure of cooking simply but wants the meal to look and taste like a million dollars. The fact that it's fun to read and good for you, makes this little book a real bargain."
3,in the middle,"Some recepies turned out really good and I was very happy with this book, but then I kept trying other recepies that were tasteless...so I have mixed feelings. I like the design, it's small and easy to read. I just wish all recepies were good and tasty"
5,delivers what it promises,"The thing I liked about this book was that the recipes taste complex and sophisticated, but they're easy enough for a busy college student to make. The ingredients are inexpensive and easy to find, too. Raymond takes classics from all over the world and simplifies them for the first-time cook, keeping their essences intact. The other good thing is that the food is very healthy and low-fat. No college student who uses this book will need to worry about the ""freshman 15"". I think it would make a great gift for the college-bound."
4,Nice newbie book,"It's a great inspirational book and it has a great deal of easy recipies within texmex, sandwich, soup, salat etc. It's not one of those don't harm the animal books. It gives quite some views on some of the greatest problems in the world - starvation - and how Africa could get around it. Although this is just a couple of pages in the beginning.There is a shopping list, a chapter on how to store vegetables. Even though I've cooked vegetarian meals for years, just to focus more on veggies, before I now took the final step, this is a great book for anyone who wants to jump into becomming vegetarian or just want to learn other ways to prepare a healthy meal."
5,My favorite cookbook -- and I'm not even vegetarian!,"I bought this cookbook when I was a graduate student, and I found it an invaluable reference. It's perfect for someone on a budget who's interested in healthy vegetarian meals. Everything makes one or two servings, and none of the recipes call for outrageous or huge lists of ingredients. The recipes are delicious whether you're a vegetarian or not. And many can be easily adapted to include meat. I'm no longer a student, but I still find that this is one of the cookbooks I use most frequently. I owned the previous edition and used it till the pages fell out. I bought the most current edition and it's well loved, too. I've given this book as a gift many times and truly recommend it highly."
4,Some are gross,The french toast was nasty. I was sick for several hours from the veg. oil in it. The tofu stuff was great though.
1,Very basic cookbook for beginners,"I read only positive reviews of this before buying it and wish I had read some negative ones too which had dissuaded me from buying it so I wouldn't have wasted $9 on it. This is a very, very basic cookbook and is definitely not for the home cook with any experience at all. For example, it has a recipe for pita pizza crust (oil and bake) and banana and pineapple yogurt (combine fruit with pre-made yogurt). I would say this would be a great child's cookbook - and maybe that's the ""student"" part. I assumed student meant inexpensive, didn't realize it was for students in elementary school."
1,"""The Coroner""","To say that this movie is the worst I have ever seen would be overrating it. The villain has a scar on his nose that comes and goes from scene to scene, and no, this is not an attempt at parody. It is so unremittingly terrible that I can't even pinpoint anything. Caveat emptor!"
1,Dear God... and to think that this movie was to be seen?,"I saw this movie when I went with my roommate to visit a couple of his friends at another college... Thank God it was a rented movie! This was the worst movie I have ever seen, being even worse than Cliffhanger (which was, needless to say, at least *funny* in its own badly made way). This movie has terrible acting, a stupid plot, is boring, and instead of being scary, it's just downright disturbing at certain moments of torture (i.e. when the wacko bad guy-figure cuts the girl's finger off... now that was just gross, but not scary). I cannot tell anyone how many times I was falling asleep in this movie. Total trash. And what's more, who would want to spend the $50 for it that it costs at amazon.com? I'd not even waste a penny on this movie. Do yourself a favor, people, and forget you ever heard of this."
3,SUNDAY MORNING WITH DAVEY AND GOLIATH,"I REMEMBER VIVIDLY GROWING UP WITH DAVEY AND GOLIATH. TWO 15 MIN. EPISODES EVERY SUNDAY MORNING STARTING AT 6 A.M. ON CH. 7. THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL ALONG WITH THE NEW YEARS SPECIAL WAS GREAT AS WELL. HOPING TO GET THE EASTER SPECIAL ABOUT DAVEYS GRANDMOTHER PASSING AWAY ON DVD. I HAVE VOL. 1,2,AND 3. EXCELLENT VIEWING EVEN TODAY."
4,It's magical but it doesn't extend to 14 feet,"The action on this product is simply magical. Just set the orange ring on top of the ball, give it a barely perceptible nudge, then lift the ball out of the woods/water. It's a true marvel. The retriever collapses and easily fits inside your golf bag pocket. It's strong and sturdy, seemly very well made. However, it doesn't extend to 14 feet as the product description states. Either I didn't get the right product, or the product description is inaccurate. Mine extends only 10 feet but that is enough for me since I never hit balls THAT far out of bounds or into the water....cheesy grin... I would buy this product again but I think someone needs to fix the description, hence 4 stars."
5,"Compact, Works well","This is a great ball retriever. It fits in a pocket in your golf bag instead of taking up club space. When extended, its very sturdy and does the job nicely. A very good product at a good price."
2,Picture doesn't really illustrate item,The picture is a bit deceiving of this item. The orange end is the end used to extract the golf ball and then it is just a retractable pole. There are many other similar items on the market for less money.
1,Cheaply made,"Was over disappointed in this, its very cheaply made and wasn't even the ashtray on the box, do not buy."
3,Ashtray as described but missing loop lock,Not much to say. It's an ashtray but there are no options as to where to put it. The box reads loop lock included but there was none.
5,Great quality,It does what you would expect it to. It is non-magnetized so you can use it on your hard drive for your computer. I personally ordered this because I wanted to take my Xbox 360 controllers apart to fix the sticky button issues I was having with them. This worked great.
2,Coffee table photo book,"Another elegantly published 600-page photo book world we all easily can live without. RETHINK is an overwrought, ""full of itself"" and pretentious treatment of the post 9/11 terrorism war. To my husband and me it is the classic example of proverbial ""coffee table"" book in the endless stream of vanity self publishing.Granted, this photo album has some great images by Mr. Knight and by few others, nice design touches here and there and the obligatory these days' presence high profile essay contributors.We expected something different, maybe less predictable form RETINK. The previous reviewer raved about it. But it is my fault -- I should hold to my money and not spend it at Barnes & Noble for the sleek photo book that we opened once. Maybe more luck next time..."
3,A Short-Life Massager,"I had this massager for about a year then it just died one day, for no apparant reason. I didn't use it very much but I thought it worked well during the few times I used it. I guess I got a lemon. I hope you are luckier."
1,not really for young ones,"i got the toy because it was something different - a light up toy. i misread the information that it wasn't the toy that lights up, it's the clothes. i really don't think the outfit is very appropriate for young girls, so i changed her into something else. my daughter never saw the light up shirt."
4,Soo Cool,I have all three of these Dolls i Love them I think Barbie should make more lite up clothes so we Have more Choices .Wonderful Toy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not as good as her others,"I chose the book because I really enjoyed others by the author. While enjoyable, it wasn't as good as the others that I had read."
5,Superb!,"Simply put - I learned more about security from this book than any other book I have previously read. The authors describe web security very well and in an easy to understand manner. Best of all _EVERYTHING_ is by example. None of the book is pure theory and every comment is backed up with supporting facts.Also, unlike many books in vogue today, this is not a scare-mongering book. It treats security in a logical, matter-of-fact manner.You'll love it!"
1,Worse than nothing,"Probably the worse book I've read on IIS security. This is what the books says on setting File security on your web: ""use the wizard"".Book contains basic school book information on security but nothing specific on what to do.There are chapters on using SQL server (yes in an IIS book) but nothing on using Oracle or other databases."
4,Very Nice,I bought this book used and was in excellent condition. It was delivered in a timely manner which made me very happy.Thank you.
3,Too Much Information! Too Wordy!,"Sandy Fritz talks too much in this book! This is our text for Massage School and it is Sooooooo overwhelming. There is a lot of unneccesary information in this book, but since the tests were based on the book, we had to read it all.What I am saying is if this is not required reading for your school, don't spend the money on it. It does have very good information in it, but you have to read a lot of useless babble from Sandy Fritz to gleen the good stuff. Overwhelming and boring! Be careful who you mention this to, also. Seems that there are some die hard Sandy Fritz fans out there who will be very upset by this thought...."
5,Great detailed book!,The book was easy to comprehend and follow. The pictures were great help as well and the book provided many helpful tips and techniques.
3,Not for animal masage,"I purchased this book because it was recommend from the school I attend. However it covered things regarding the human Massage therapist (Ethics and legal things), and found it not to be helpful at least not me."
5,"Great for Baking - Much Better than the ""Simply Calphalon"" Line","The Calphalon Classic jelly roll pan is great for baking. Compared to the Simply Calphalon pan that it replaced, it (1) is much more lightweight and (2) doesn't tend to burn results as often. I find that results are evenly heated with less over-browning on the bottoms of baked goods. Cleanup is very simple as is the case with all Calphalon products.Like other reviewers, I've heard some pops when heating over 400 degrees, but it's nothing to worry about because the pan has always retained its shape."
1,Useless - They Warp!,"I have three of these pans, and they are the most expensive and the most useless cookie sheets I've ever owned! Every single one of them warps instantly once it's in the over resulting in lopsided baked products. Buy a different kind, the Calphalon ones are horrible."
1,Not good for serious bakers,"I used this pan for jelly rolls, bread, cookies and everything that can go in the oven for 2 years now. Much to my disappointment the pan warps and the finish wears off quickly. I'm switching to commercial roll pans"
3,Gar Wood boat history,"Excellent history of Gar Wood commercial boat production. Sadly, nothing is said of his relationship with Harry Miller, Miller engines, or much, for that matter, of Wood's boat racing."
5,"Do what it says, and feel it yourself.","Not the best writing or photography, but who cares...it works! This is one of the biggest surprises in a small package I have ever read in the field of qiqong.No esoteric jibberish here, right up front the author tells you precisely what to do in clear step by step order.I felt the qiqong sensations, especially in the hands and forearms, right away. Yes I do qiqong and am probably sensitised to it, but this simple and effective system had the fastest real results of any system I have ever studied.Pangu Qiqong is presented as a health practice, but martial artists will find it filling them with power too.Anything negative to say? Yup. The system is presented in a concise and direct way...it doesn't fill up much of the book. So the author filled up the rest with more flowery exposition and anecdotal experiences. This add-on material does not add much to the knowledge of the reader. But hey, the instruction is worth it!"
3,Author is trying to promote his products,"At first I had good feelings about this book, but as I got into it I discovered that it is very shallow in theory and spent a lot of time promoting the author and his products. The forms used in the book are good when practiced daily and would be a nice addition to a more complete Qigong workout, but by themselves they lack completeness. I was especially turned off when the author stated that if you practiced certain things without his approval it could injure you. The particular exercise he was talking about, at the level he was teaching is totally safe and deserves better treatment."
3,Very light!!,Too light. For its size weighs little. It is so light that not remains hung. Excact width and and lenght
4,Great Game!,"I orginally got TMNT 2: Battle Nexus for my PC at a very reason price. $9.99 to be exact. The game is awesome! great graphics, smooth gameplay and lots of butt kicking ninja action. It's a fun game that you can play over and over again when you want to kick some shell!But, I orginally only bought the game because of the unlockable classic TMNT arcade game. When I got the game and finally got the antique for that item, it wouldn't unlock and nobody at the Konami Forums has been able to provide an explanation as to why it won't unlock. Yet the arcade game unlocks on the console versions of this game.Even though I ended up disappointed, I still ended up keeping the game and still play it from time to time because it's alot of fun to play.I would reccomend this game to any TMNT lover who wants a fun, fighting game to enjoy!"
3,Phantom Lover,"If you do a bit of a mental squint and use your imagination to smooth out the rough edges, this is a pretty good story. To put it in movie terms: it's likeLadyhawkemeetsThe Sixth Sense.Parl Dro is a handsome ghost killer - he releases the undead who are clinging to the living and sends them to their final destination. Everything changes when Parl stops in a little town to deal with a pair of sisters, Cilny and Ciddey, one dead and one living. There his destiny is joined to the roguish pick-pocketing troubadour Myal, and together they journey to Ghyste Mortua, the ghost city in the mountains.Like all the other Lee books I have read, it is full of psychic power, supernatural sensuality, thwarted love, sadness and regrets."
5,fond memories,"i've fond memories of this book and the others in this series. i only wish, that i had kept my copies from when i was a kid, because sometimes curling up with a sound book such as this one and the others really puts one at ease. i've thanks to my sister, who in the late 70's was going to UCLA and she had a thing for dragons. With one little book she changed my world. i eagerly awaited each and everyone of the serendipity books. it makes me cry now, thinking about them."
2,Different language,"The book came in the appropriate amount of time and was in good condition, the problem was only that it was in Spanish and that information was not listed anywhere on the website when I made my purchase."
4,Overall a Good Read,"I've been an ELP fan since I first heard Lucky Man on the radio back in 1970. Keith's book (and it his own autobiography - no co-author) is a must for any ELP or Emo fan. I naturally read the ELP chapters first and enjoyed them tho details are fairly scant. Keith gives Greg Lake a bit of a hard time but, all in all, its easy to tell that their relationship is probably like brothers - great at times, tough at other times. He has nothing but good to say about Carl Palmer who comes across as the peacemaker for the 3 when they were together. A good bloke and fine percussionist. The best part of the book for me is the early years. Keith does a fine job documenting his childhood and teen years with plenty of quaint, funny stories. Lotsa humor from a man who seems quite humble despite the iconic status many of us view him under. For this price, grab it and enjoy."
3,Could have been better,"Pictures of an Exhibitionist by Keith Emerson could have been a great book by one of the greatest keyboardists of all time.Instead, it drags on at times."
1,"Poor, disjointed","I'm sorry to say that Keith Emerson comes across as a real yob in this book, but that's not the main problem with this book. This book makes it seem like he doesn't remember all too much from the glory days, just bits and pieces here and there. There's little continuity in the book, and you get no idea as to how ELP created what they did.Looks like a quick cash-in to me, avoid the book."
2,Disappointing...,"First, I am a huge ELP/Keith Emerson fan. I've been looking forward to this book for years. In the mean time, I've read some outstanding books on Keith and ELP by Martyn Hanson, Hang on to a Dream: The Story of the Nice; and George Forrester, Emerson, Lake and Palmer : The Show That Never Ends. Then I got Keith's book. Rather disappointing. Not well written at all. I guess Keith felt he needed to put out a ""tell all"" type book full of drugs stories, alchohol and sex stories. My image of him as a person has been tarnished, but he is still a great musician and composer. Unfortunatly, the book was put out in haste, the pacing is poor, the style inconsistant. His childhood days are interesting and a couple of funny stories, but that's all. Stick to music Keith; how about a CD set on rare, underground or retrospective music? Get the other two books I mentioned in this review, don't bother with this one."
3,Good fist half of a book,"Many other reviews here have pointed out the many plusses and minuses of this book. The honesty is good. The fact that it just stops just as it was getting kind of interesting makes me thing he wrote it on spec and either couldn't get anyone to pay him to write any more or he just got tired of writing. The book also needs an editor as parts repeat. I enjoyed the book, but there was so much more that I would have liked to have read about. The recording process of some albums is discussed in detail while others are brushed over in a page. It makes you wonder if Keith just wrote what he could remember and that was it. But if you want to know what he has been doing for the last ten years or so, you really won't find it here."
4,An easy read,"Unlike some 'rock star' autobiographies this one may actually be written by the man in the photo on the front cover. If so he's done a fine job as this is an easy and entertaining read.The book starts in 1993 when Keith Emerson had to have surgery on his right-hand, and then goes back to the 1940's when he was born. All the expected topics are covered music, drugs, personal life etc and you can tell from the writing that he regrets some of the excesses at the height of his fame.There are some great musical stories in this book. My two favourites are his meeting with Rick Wakeman (who he considered to be his main competitor as best keyboard player in the 70's), and a whole chapter is devoted to his appearance on Oscar Petersons show in 1975.The 1980's to date are covered pretty briefly, which is a shame, but it doesn't detract from what is overall a fine book."
4,Great!,"I laughed out loud, literally, when I opened the box. This item is perfect for any John Belushi or Animal House fan. I wouldn't qualify it as a toy, more a collectors type item for display. Its more detailed than I anticipated. I would recommend this item."
2,monster round table,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan, Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If, though, you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall, Tokyo is not threatened, no buildings are crushed, no tin tanks are destroyed, no thousands of people flee in terror, there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
2,Ghidorah,"The Movie was pretty good. If you like old classic Godzilla movies , then you will enjoy this one as well."
2,Rubber Cheese,"this particular movie is more of a comedy camp classic than the typical Kaiju flick of its time. the use of puppets during the fight scenes between Godzilla and Rodan are particularly laughable, as is the three way conversations between monsters as translated by the faeries. Still, for the collector, it is the introduction of Godzilla's main foe for the rest of the series of movies right up till final wars, so I would still say it belongs in a collection."
4,Four great monsters and Akiko!!,"If you like your monsters bruising it up, this is your flick. The battle between Godzilla and Rodan is one of the best ever. VERY dirty pool by Rodan!This great flick also features Akiko Wakabayashi. Some may recognize her from ""You Only Live Twice"" or ""What's up Tiger Lilly?"". She a fine actress and a real beauty.Go ahead and get ""Invasion of Astro-Monster"" (aka ""Monster Zero"") at the same time. It's the best pure sequel of any of the 60's G-Flicks."
4,Great Fun!,"It doesn't get any better than giant monsters fighting each other and tearing up the town. TOHO had the best suit actors on their payroll as well as the best special effects crew of the time. And if you pay attention, you will learn that it's wrong to pollute the Earth and that we caused the mess we're in. You have to love a movie that has wanton destruction and yet delivers a ""green"" message. Enjoy!"
3,Not what i was expecting,I first off love the movie. My only real problem was that what i got wasn't what the amazon store picture was. I recived the normal slip cover viersion instead of the silver case with green bang. Not a big issue but still rather annoying when your a collector and you expect one case and they send you the crap version.
2,Pre-drilled Holes did not align,"While the refills are nicely laid out with colorful tabs, the pre-drilled holes did not align with my calendar binder."
1,golf for dummies,"This is the worst golf instruction book I have ever read. Inadequate swing mechanics, not anywhere enough detail on technique, incomplete discussion of the swing. I've read about twenty books on golf instruction and this ranks dead last."
1,Golf for Dummies,"I was totally taken by surprise when I received the book - yes, in hardcover - that was no larger than my palm. While humorous, I know little more than before I read the book. I was trying to be less ignorant about golf, but the glossary of terms was poorly done. I still don't know what ""par"" means!"
1,Read the small print,"I also missed the small print that this is a 2 INCH by 2INCH book (and I don't mean thick). The reviews telling of all the good information and long descriptions are posted under the wrong book. AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX THIS - It's close to deceptive advertising.It names the 7 functions of the included tool, but I still have no idea what those functions mean or how to use the tool to do it.I guess it's off to the local book store so I can see what I'm getting. I was looking forward to reading this book this weekend. :("
4,Good Golf Book,"This book has many tips on how to play better golf. The pictures are good and easy to follow. All in all a pretty good golf instruction book. If you really want an awesome book on golf instruction get:The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better by Patrick Leonardiisbn 1933023090This last book showed me how to improve with techniques that are much easier to follow. My scores are now finally improving. In fact, every month since using this book, my scores have improved by about one stroke per month. I highly recommend it, nothing else on the market like Leonardi's book."
3,not really for dummies,"I am as dummy as you can get them as I bought the book to prepare myself for my first golf lesson. However, in my opinion the book is not really for people who know nothing. It seems more suitable for people who already play some golf, but who want to know a bit more around it (famous players, nice golf courses,...), but less suited for people who want to save some bucks by preparing themselves for serious golf lessons.Often the 'Dummies' books are really funny, but in this one I thought the jokes were often too artificial. Perhaps golf is no fun?"
3,Not everyone is a dummie,"This book (I have the original version) is entertaining and useful in that it includes the whole golfing experience, from selecting clothes to on-course etiquette. But it is not anywhere near the only golf book you'll need. The photography used to illustrate technique is not as clear as it might be. The authors use a lot of space dropping names of celebrity golf pros they know and telling amusing stories. I found myself always looking for more detail, more physiology and more physics.Golf for Dummies is very good for neophytes, but not enough for those who become enthusiasts."
1,Worst Purchase online ever,"Don't buy this kit. It is worthless. You will just end up returning it. This is a shipping company's dream. Believe me there is no ""book"" involved; it is a pamphlet. The other items included are throw-aways.I had to give it one star to pass the review edits, but it really deserves a negative rating. I wish I would have read the reviews on this purchase. I will on all items in the future."
1,confused,"I thought I was buying one of the series of books for dummies. I want to learn to golf!!! What I got was an itsy bitsy little booklet, cards and a golf tool. I just wanted your basic GOLF FOR DUMMIES paper back book. No wonder it was sooooo cheap. Thanks for asking my opinion. Bonnie Murray"
2,Two Stars and Two Words....Very Little,"Maybe I just didn't look at the photo correctly or I must have missed the fine print that said this Golf for Dummies was a booklet and not a book. It was less than 4""x4"" and I can't remember how few pages it had because I threw the $*#& thing away. Besides the booklet there were two Common Faults and How to fix them cards. Here is an example of one of the faults and solutions-- ERROR: Poor Putting CAUSE: Poor Aim SOLUTION: Go Practice . Wow! I knew this book was for Dummies but not that Dumb. I buy a How To book on the assumption I will actually learn something. The up side was that I spent less than $10 for it and it did come with a nifty little golf tool that was some consulation. If you want a nifty golf tool then buy this, if you want to learn something about golf then get something else."
5,Great Book for Players of all Abilities,"I'm a Golf Instructor and purchased the book because I enjoy Gary's humorous side of golf.If your handicap is higher than legal drinking age, or if you're a Club Champion, I'm confident you will find Gary's book not only funny and entertaining, but informative and insightful. It's also and excellent reference book, if you're having trouble with one or more areas of your game, or if you want to make your good game better.I will be taking a number of his tips, drills, and techniques to my students this season!Great job, Gary! Keep up the great work!"
5,great resource for a beginner,"While you still benefit best from a personal lesson, reading this book has been very helpful!"
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book thinking it was the full-size ""Golf for Dummies"" I saw at the book store. It isn't. It is a miniature book of about 15 pages with no pictures. The picture is deceptive."
2,Miniature book - beware,"Boy was I disappointed when this book arrived. I thought this book was going to be substantial, the book image on Amazon didn't mention it was the miniature edition, but it was tiny. I was hoping I could digest its contents over the coming weeks and months - but after 30 minutes flipping through it I'm done with it. Anybody want a gift to give to their worst enemy?"
2,Dummies get Idiots instead!,"I did not like this book at all. I bought it soon after taking up golf again after 30 years, but had I looked at it in a bookstore, would have bought the Idiot's Guide instead. This book really didn't give me any valuable info for picking up the game again, and was liberally sprinkled with McCord's smart-aleck cracks, which really put me off. I just don't like the guy, even on TV infomercials. He needs to get a real job, like the rest of us."
2,Not a good place to start learning about golf,"This was the first book I turned to myself when I took up golf... around a dozen years or so ago. I've generally found the Dummies books a good place to start when learning the basics in any area. Sadly this one is an exception. It is really not a good introduction to the game of golf. There are many, many golf instruction books out there, and most of them are superior to this one. If you want to stay in the Dummies type area, the KISS (Keep It Simple Series) Guide to Playing Golf by Steve Duno is a vastly superior alternative - it's basically everything this Dummies book should have been and isn't."
5,Chock-Full of Info,"I aspire to learn the game of golf, so I have been reading various books and magazines. I have not been on the course yet, but after reading this book...my fears are gone. This was the most helpful golf book that I have read to date. I just want to share a fraction of info included: history on golf, breaking down the golf course, playing a smart game (no ego), how to keep score, proper etiquette, fun golf history facts, how to dress, color photos that show for example ""The Vardon Grip"". I look forward to my first lesson and then discussion at the 19th Hole."
5,I never knew that!,"As I went through this book (and once through really isn't enough) I kept saying things like, ""I never knew that!"" There's a TON of information about all things golf. There are even exercises to do to help your game. I was amazed, and also amused, throughout the book. It's really a lot like all the ""dummy"" books; full of info, some of which you'll never use, but some will really come in handy and the rest falls somewhere in the middle."
2,Too much non-essential fillers,"I agree with the reader from Rockford. I was, too, disappointed with this book, because it is filled with non-essential information about players and tours, about which I care nothing since I am more eager to learn how to play as well as how to ask the right questions. The basic instructions are good, but the photos are a little difficult to decipher. On the other hand, the writing is lucid.A better beginner's guide, IMHO, is ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Golf."" I learned more from it than from this book."
2,Golf For Dummies,Good Little book. Thought it was for the larger one. Good read just not what I wanted.
2,OK on the basics.,"Had a good section on grip, alignment, etc. Equipment and fitness sections in my oppinion haven't kept up with the changes in the game."
5,The greatest golf book for everyone,This is the best golf book I've ever read. The author did a great job to help me find my weak points and adjust my posture of swing. Now I can swing much better. I also like the author's sense of humor. The best thing I found in this book is that what the author suggested are really work!
1,Save your money!,"Like several other reviewers, I thought I was getting a regular book. What I got was a joke. The booklet is a complete waste of time. For example, the advice on grip says to hold the club in the left hand and then place right hand above it. Are you kidding? I like Gary McCord as a commentator and the Dummies books are usually alright, but this was a waste of money. As for the seven-in-one tool, buy a regular divot tool and throw this piece of garbage away!"
1,Buyer Beware,"Look carefully before you buy this book. I thought I was getting a regular dummies book....you know one that is a regular book size and has more than 100 pages. I just looked at the name and the picture and with my knowledge of the ""Dummies"" series, I purchased this.I found this product worthless. This is a book that fits in your palm and is only 32 pages long. There's very little info on each page. The divot tool that comes with the book sells for $5.99 at Dicks. So, that tells you how much is really being spent on the book.Be careful and buy the real book and not the small pocket book. I notice that both are listed with the same titles on this web site."
1,MINI VERSION,The hardcover version is the mini version. Don't bother wasting your time on this book. The listing doesn't clearly reflect the fact that it is miniature.
4,Hefty Tome,At 3.25 pounds this is a hefty book of weighty information. It is not an easy book for me to collect the enclosed vauable information. But it is work the effort. The side benefit is increasing muscle tone and bird knowledge increases.
3,Sibley bird behavior,Have not found this book to be interesting. It jumps around and covers many birds at once. You have to spend time looking to find a bird and then it is not comprehensive enough. Would not buy this book again. Disappointing as I do use his bird guide.
3,Way too much info,"I wanted info about birds of the Northeast...buying this book was a big mistake...veryheavy to carry around, and hard to find thebirds I am interested in just because thereis soooo much info here. On the otherhand, if you want an encyclopedia, this isyour book./"
4,An informative book.,"This is a useful book about bird behavior written by a true expert. It's a bit like a textbook the way it approaches broad topics and discusses various aspects.Like any textbook, I suppose, if you go into this book with a specific question and hope for a specific answer, you may not find it. However, if you were trying to write a school report or something you would certainly find lots of useful tidbits of information in the general area of your topic.I'd say that rather than thinking of this as a reference book, you should think of it as background reading, to be taken in small doses, for the above-and-beyond birding enthusiast."
2,Way too much info,"Was looking for an ""advanced field guide"" and this turned out to be more of a Text Book. Still looking..."
5,Sibley's Bird Behaviour Guide,I am very satisfied with the sale. The quality of the book and the hassle-free sale and speed of delivery were just as hoped for. Thank you very much-- you are recommended! Tom Richards
4,Bird Guide,This book is a little more in depth than I thought it would be and doesn't have nearly enough pictures to help identify birds when you go into a region you aren't familiar with.
2,Not enough specific information,"This book is too general in the information it gives about ALL the birds in America. Yes, the first 120 pages give good information, but I was looking for detailed behavioral information about the birds living in our area. It should have been divided up into regions, as are the guides. Perhaps if it had been divided, I would have found more information about the life and behavior of the birds living in my particular region. I don't travel enough to see birds in other regions. My Peterson's gives far more information in half the amount of pages on these aspects."
5,Great CD,"Love the Cd got it before I thought cheap and I was surprised I was able to find it , will buy more"
3,Great Book For The Advanced Exerciser,This book is not for the beginner!Advanced exercisers will get a good challenge with these routines.It could use a bit more substance on the nutritional guidance topic as this is crucial for getting those abs to be visible.If want some tough workouts get this book.Joey Atlas - The Wizard of Fitness[...]
3,I find it incomplete,"On the back cover the book says it does an extensive job on showing you the right diet to get the right abs, but as a reader I was very dissapointed to discover that there are only two pages on diet. Now the routines are very straightforward, but the exercises are extremely difficult to perform. I think there are better books out there than this abs book."
3,the norm,"It explains a few extra things about the abs,but nothing on nutrition and the same ol,same ol on excercises,nothing special."
3,"too big, but not returning","I bought these for low back bucket seats in a 1979 Jeep CJ5. These covers are much too large for my application, but for the price I paid I'll keep them until I replace the seats themselves. Quality seems good at this price point."
5,"Cemetery Walk: Journey into the Art, History and Society of the Cemetery and Beyond","For all those who enjoy walking through cemeteries taking in the quiet and the art around us, this is definitely the book for you. If you are one who gets creeped out just looking at a cemetery, this book may help to ease your queasiness. Very well done. There is lots of information in this book about the history of the cemeteries, tombstones and even stories about some of the urban legends. A must read!"
1,The worst botle book I have ever seen,"This book is totally out of date- no pictures, not at all revelant to what I am looking for. Poorly organized. Poorly bound."
3,"Good XML summary, too much reliance on Perl scripts","It's a pretty decent indication of the potential of the XML document/messaging structure, but lacks significant insight into designing any type of formal business application.Most of the book relies heavly on perl scripts for message processing. I wish some attention was directed at VB/ASP or CGI for message processing.With few XML books on the market, I would recommend this book, as it provides a good insight of the potential of XML."
5,A Gem of a Book,Love Held Hostage is an exciting adventure in a tropical setting. The book feels like the characters are hallucinating... and maybe they are. The story is based on Vietnam Vets battling PTSD. Superlative fiction from a gifted writer.
4,Good Spanish Music,"When I first bought this album, I had to listen it several times to get the flavor and really enjoy it. Tough it might be a bit repetitive in the rhythm, the lyrics are just beautiful. Just ""Tu tierra y mis semillas"" is worth the whole album"
2,not worth the money,Messed up areas on actual poster and bad medium for coloring which is the whole purpose. Took the longest to ship.
2,Not My Cup Of Tea....,"I'm a fan of the later E.N. records so this one was way too ""industrial"" for me. Lot's of gutteral screaming and also just poorly recorded. It seems those who like the early stuff often don't care for the later works but I'm just the opposite. I think these guys grew into something special but to me this stuff is just nothing but noise."
3,Early Neubauten that works more often than not...,"I always thought the notion of a 'live' industrial album was a bit of a con. The fact is, most audiences at a true industrial show won't make the anywhere NEAR the kind of noise the act will (unless you're a NIN stalwart) during the course of the show.But here, in one of the earliest Neubauten efforts, most of the tunes work in so far as they represent where the band was at that point in time. ""Strategies Against Architecture II"" is infinitely better, but decidedly NOT for the timid. It's got it's boring moments as well, which is why I haven't given it one of those absurdly reverential 5-star ratings.Industrial music is not meant to sooth, and this album is no exception. But complete your collection with sharper Neubauten releases, and pick up this one after you're sure you can handle it."
5,Wingmen Warriors Soars again,Lt. Colonel Lucas Quade is still haunted by the memories of his late wife. Five years ago he had to flee a war torn country and leaving his wife's body behind haunts him. Now he is on a mission to rescue a woman who resembles Sara.Sarafina Quade had been kept secluded for five years. She was told Lucas and her younger brother were killed fleeing the country. Sara would risk it all to escape and to protect her and Lucas's child.Both Sara and Lucas are in for the shock of their lifes. Lucas meets his child and Sara comes face to face with a very alive Lucas. But before they can celebrate and go forward they must escape through the jungle.The Captive's Return is another compelling Wingmen Warrior tale. Lucas and Sara both are strong and passionate characters. Their child adds a deeply touching dimension to this wonderful story.
4,Great Portable Speakers,"I am a traveling music teacher and really don't want to lug a boombox around with me. Further, I prefer to use my Creative Stone Plus to store my music, rather than a multitude of CDs.Enter the Creative 250 portable speaker. I can have my elementary school bands play along with the recordings...something they couldn't do with a typical boombox (volume couldn't compete).I had my reservations, but ordered 3 systems online (one for two different schools, and one for home) and figured it was worth the gamble for the price.Overall, I am immensely pleased with this purchase.Now, for some ideas for improvement...1. The line in cord SHOULD be longer. Yes, you can buy one on your own, but I don't see the purpose for such a short cord (other than cost-cutting).2. Have a digital volume readout.3. (This is for the seller, not the product:) Don't raise the price by $5 in one week. I know, I know, it's STILL an amazing deal. You have a right to make a profit.... Sigh."
4,Creative Labs Travelsound 250 Speaker System,"For their size and incredibly discounted price, these are not bad speakers. I tote them with me to use when working on location. They're a bit heavy for constant schlepping, but at least have a modicum of bass response. Unlike some other small speakers, at least you know there IS bass on the recording. A very good deal and acceptable/decent sound."
2,Value for money? I think not.,"They look nice, but that is about all I can positively say. Once you turn up the volume they distort wildly. The connecting cable is tiny and, annoyingly, no power adaptor is supplied. If you are playing your music loudly through them the batteries just don't last. Value for money? I think not."
2,"Save your money,,, I expected MUCH more for $40","I love the looks of this speaker system... but then the fun ends. The audio-in cord is about 8 inches long, which doesn't give you much placement option; the unit is freestanding only, and I had to keep grabbing it while traveling to keep it near the computer; and worse of all, any volume greater than my original pc speakers caused severe distortion... like the speakers were busted already. I listen to a lot of talk, as well as music, which fared no better. I cringed at the sound from these speakers for about 6 hours on a road trip before promptly returning them for a refund."
4,Nice for iPods,"I bought this item pretty much for my iPod, as the other reviewer said it does come with a short cord but hey buy a longer one which costs $2 at radio shack. one thing I don't like is that it doesn't come with an AC adaptor.So far the sound quality is pretty good for a little speaker system, theres a subwoofer which is sold seperately so when you do turn up the volume it does get distorted a bit.To me it's great for hotel rooms etc. when traveling."
4,Pretty good for an MP3 player,"I am only using this speaker with my MP3 player, usually at work. It works really well for playing music at my desk. I don't know how long the batteries will last (no AC power adaptor included). I am still using the batteries that it came with and they have not died yet after about 2 weeks of use at the office. I don't know how much use you will get with 4 AAA batteries, but I guess you can always plug it in if you have an adaptor."
4,As if the characters from Rent made an AIDS movie,"Easily one of the most deeply political AIDS movies made in the '90s. Don't expect great film making by Hollywood standards; you'll just be disappointed. But imagine (or remember) what it was like for people living with AIDS in the mid '90s (just as the toxic AZT was being transitioned into the very first hints of antiretrovirals). Believe it or not, this movie encapsulates the hope, anger, and craving to have fun again that pervaded this period. It was mind blowing that anyone would do a musical about AIDS (Rent hadn't even opened off-broadway yet) much less one as wacky, unconventional, and in your face as Zero Patience."
5,Still Touching,"Another dated classic. I love the raw innocence of this film. I find myself crying, laughing, being sexually aroused and singing this music days after viewing it.Sometimes I think ""Broadway Musical"" or high-tech modern film - but because the AIDS epidemic is something different today it probably wouldn't work. I love the actors!I love this film! I remember the person I saw it with, close friend, died in 2004 of AIDS. He had the viris almost 20 years."
2,Best for the Novice,"The strength of this book is the number of topics it covers. Its main weakness, though, is the same. By including so many topics, the reader actually learns very little. Even a child doing a class paper on a subject in this book would have to draw upon other resources. The book is best suited for people who have little or no knowledge of deserts. Unfortunately, that means kids. But most kids would never pick this book up since there isn't one colored photograph in the book. Even the black and white photos are not the greatest quality. For its size and price, the book was a disappointment. But then, I live in the desert so maybe I was hoping for something a bit more useful and informative.Chris Alexander Las Cruces, New Mexico"
1,returned item,I returned this item. It provided very little light and the color wasn't white at all.
3,wall sconce,The technical details on amazon's page says it has a remote but the product details says it doesn't. I bought the sconce but I was confused and expecting to place it in a hard to reach place so a remote would be really useful. The lamp itself work fine but gives off that blue glow like some leds tend to do. I will probably return it.
1,Poor quality,"This looks better than the real thing, Its very poorly constructed not at all worth the price. Very dissapointed on reception of product. I've never used it only because of cheap materials."
1,what are the dimensions?,"Exciting Lighting Wireless EZ Wall Sconce, White Mica #EZ1001What are the dimensions?I would also like some other qualifying information about this product before I decide to purchase it."
5,The First Action Hero,"From the 1933 pulp magazine....Doc Savage is the original action hero. Raised by scientists as the world's most perfectly developed human, physically and mentally, he covers the world battling evil, searching for excitement and bloodcurdling adventure.In this origin story, he travels to Central America in search of his father's killers, and uncovers the most --- ah, you've got to read it yourself!"
3,Too Biased,"As another reviewed mentioned, this book would have been more enjoyable if presented as more of a history instead of the political point of view that it is. The book should be presented less as a ""history"" and more of an ""editorial opinion."" That said, if you can ignore all that, it is a fun run through the topical points of each year."
1,"Never Recieved, Never Refunded","They say they sent it to my address, but i never recieved it. I contacted the merchant, and did not get any help. They just say they sent it."
1,never got the package,Never got this package.tracking says delivered....footlocker does not refund via email communication.I will not bother calling customer support and select an alternate product and risk dealing with the same problem again.
5,An excellent starting point,"An excellent summary of well-newborn care provided in outline form for efficient reading. The information is comprehensive, but concise. An excellent starting point for nurses new to the care of newborns. Includes information on how to identify the sick newborn without going into much detail, which makes this book a good preface to AWHONN's Core Curriculum for Neonatal Intensive Care Nursing."
4,Graphic Images,"I haven't read the whole book yet, but I was shocked by the graphic images in the very beginning of the book: the book starts out with a section of color plates of various conditions a newborn might have. I don't know why, if it is the book is called Assessment and Care of the WELL NEWBORN, they needed to start the book with those images- they could have been tucked away in the back.... Great resource otherwise."
3,From Blah to Ok I can dig it.,"When I first did this workout I was not fond of it- I was very bored and it did not seem to be tough...but by the second and third time I found myself enjoying the last half of the cardio. It's the first half I tend to make myself get through without falling asleep. She does repeat the combos too much but I am definately sweaty by the end of the cardio. I only did the ball segment once and it was not my cup of tea. The ab section is pretty good. The cardio will take a few times to get down, but it's not too hard to follow. I would say this is a steady state cardio workout- and does work the legs quite a bit."
4,From my generation to yours,"I have been working in the geriatric field for four years, and am currently studying it in college. I bought this book to read for pleasure, and to reaffirm why I chose to work with the older generation. This is a wonderful book that honors the elderly with heartwarming stories of family, friends, love and the effect of one life on another. Many of the stories reminded me of my own life and relationships with my grandparents. I would recommend this book as a gift for people who work with the elderly, such as a favorite nurse or caregiver. They will truly appreciate it, as will anyone who has been touched by the life of an elderly person. I would recommend this book as a fun book to read and bring back memories of your past."
1,what a shame!,"This is a very poorly written personal tale that was obviously never actually edited. The error-filled writing, immature perspective, and ridiculous story spoil any help this ""writer"" could have given to others who would like to live and work in Japan."
5,Thank you D. H. Cermeño!,This book was recommended to me by a friend. I'm not a fan of this type of fiction but I was pleasantly surprised. Rising Sunsets is very well written and overall an easy read. When I finished the book I gave it to my wife for her to read. She absolutely loved it and repaid my great recommendation with a night of amazing sex. Thanks D.H!
5,Combination of a cross cultural love story and a toxic father,"DH Cermeno's debut novel, RISING SUNSETS, is a page turner that held my attention from beginning to end. The author painted a compelling word picture throughout as he described the main character's cross cultural year in Japan, the love story he told, and the emotional abuse the main character experienced at the hands of his highly narcissistic father. He did a wonderful job throughout as he wove his tale.Dr. Beth EricksonHost of ""Relationships 101"" on [...]"
1,There are better maps,"I just returned from Panama last week. I had bought this map to use on a two week trip across most of the country. It is a very pretty map and I like the laminated paper, but it lacks sufficient detail to be useful. It does not have some major routes such as the most used road between Boquete and Al Mirante. It also lacks a blow up of Panama City. The other map (from a Canadian publisher ITMB) is FAR better despite the low reviews it seems to have gotten."
5,Probably all you need,"Comprehensive, up-to-date, and a text that is actually good reading as well as being informative. I used this on my second trip to Costa Rica and found I needed nothing else to help me get around. Well, I might have wanted information on city accommodations that were a little more upscale, but that's not really what the Rough Guides recommend."
3,New Age--but better than elevator music,"I'm really not much of a fan of New Age type stuff. But actually this isn't too bad. It has interesting sound without being boring and repetitious throughout. Definitely worth a chance--at the very least, it's something to listen to at night to get to sleep."
1,What a waste of time,As a military member about to retire I bought this looking for good advice and maybe to use as a reference. It's a waste of money. You can get the same info at your base family service center (or whatever each branch calls it) for free AND talk to a real person that will help you with questions. Do the leg work and save your cash.
4,A wealth of experience,Burke really knows what he is talking about when it comes to seaplane flying. I always enjoy reading his articles in the SPA magazine too. Too bad he never got to be an airline pilot.
1,Bad Blender,"The first B&D blender lasted 3 uses and then quit. The motor just quit. The seller replaced it with the same model and it died after 3 uses too. Same problem. Granted, these are heavy duty uses. I blend up about 5 quarts of fruits, vegetables, and nuts once a week. This includes carrots, celery, kale, other leafy veggies, onions, cauliflower, brocoli & stems, etc. Nevertheless, I have a 20-year old General Electric blender that still does it OK. If that old work horse can still cut it, these new B&D powerhouses should be able to last a lot longer than 3 uses! It is a powerful blender, but there is just no excuse for two blenders in a row biting it in exactly the same way."
1,disappointed with this blender,"This blender was bought for chirstmas last year, and it fell apart on me.Actually, it's inner gear that is made ofplastic broke. to replace the part will cost me $20 for shipping and part. That is crazy.I did not keep my receipts due to it being a simple product. The last blender i had was an old green one from the 80's and that was the best. I did not have to replace it, just tha i wanted one new an more modern looking... This is not recommended."
1,Useless,"I bought this blender specifically to make smoothies and frozen drinks. I assumed from ""Crush Master"" and the Ice Crush button that it would work well for this. The manual says no more than 6 ice cubes at a time. This won't even crush two cubes and one of the blades has bent. Also, the motor is so very loud, it's painful."
1,"Cheap plastic ""teeth"" on the base broke off in multiple places","The black plastic ""teeth"" that connect the base to the blade assembly broke in several places during use, made a terrible noise, and the pieces fell all over the counter when I removed the jar.Despite the name, and the claim, that this blender can crush ice, I've never used it for that purpose. I make smoothies, blend pesto sauce, and puree cooked vegetable and blackbean soups. Any blender should be able to easily handle such tasks.I bought B & D because I like their power tools, but I'll never buy another kitchen appliance from them. This is shoddy engineering using cheap components.When I called to find the location of the nearest B & D repair place, Customer Service told me that there are no parts for this model and that to have it repaired by a small appliance shop would cost more than buying a new one! The motor is good, the blade assembly is fine, the jar is a good one - but this blender is now USELESS!"
1,awful and black decker won't back it up,"i had bought two of them because they were a deal purchase, thinking I can keep one and let my college child have one....guess what? both of them died in the first use..I opened the boxes after the first year of purchase, obviously it was a future use...I called black and decker and they refused to back up their product. I should have checked the rating before even wasting a bit of money....I told B&D that the review sucks on this product but no back up.....I have two brand new blenders that died in the middle of my first use.....I would never buy another blender from this manufacturer because they had some nerve suggesting that I should have a local repair shop check the motors and pay for replacing it...."
5,Best tea ever!!!!,"Smells good, taste great, and it really works. For its purpose I would recommend this to anyone! Great price too!"
3,you have to be a fan of licorice,"i am not a fan of licorice so that might be the main reason why i won't buy this tea again. it's not bad.. but nor do i enjoy drinking this tea. it smells great but after a good swig.. it leaves a negative sensation of drinking something with too much sweet & low. maybe that's the licorice... it's not bad.. hence the 3 stars.. but i'm not enjoying this as much as my standard herbal teas.as to its intended purpose, it just made me gassy with really bad smelling farts. :o) maybe i just need to wait a little longer..but man.. i don't like licorice. should have read the box before i bought it.."
1,Rough Stuff,"I didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers--unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it. Still, it's worth a try because it works for many people. Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping, you are probably sensitive to SENNA, the active ingredient in the tea. So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled ""Stimulant Laxative."")So what works for me? Lots of the high-fiber foods every day. Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!) Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day. Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful. Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways.Nature is great."
5,YUMMY,"I really love this tea!it tastes WORLDS better than othersbut for me it takes about 10 hours to ""kick in""so don't DO NOT drink another cup thinking it hasn't worked!"
4,Smooth,"I use this tea for the Master Cleanser (Lemonade Diet). I don't like the flavor, because It is very bitter. But it gets the job done, and doesn't bother me at night with cramps or other abdominal pain I've experienced with other laxatives. The Chocolate version is just as bitter, you might as well get this one. Highly recommended!"
3,good housekeeping needlecraft,"good book but not what I was looking for, trying to find needlecrat book my mother had in her sewing room when I was growing-up."
1,The Mighty Saturns - Saturn V (Extended Collector's Edition),This collection of DVDs is not what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be a VERY LONG documentary. I was wrong!
3,Not as good as the original bundt pan,"I bought this pan at one of those discount stores for a great price. Although it is nonstick, you still have to grease and powder this pan.PlusesIt bakes evenlyIf you grease and powder the pan, the cake slips right off without proddingAlthough it's not as heavy as a NordicWare pan, it is still well made.Easy to cleanMinusesThe grooves aren't as deep as a NordicWare pan. This USA problem because your cake doesn't have those pronounced lines that serve as cutting guides. My cake was smooth as a baby. That's not I was looking for.The pan is made in China. Yes all things are made in China but NordicWare's pan are locally made so you really can't compare.I own the NordicWare fleur de lys pan. I wanted to save $$ by going with Calphalon. Although it's an ok pan, I would suggest getting the real deal if you want your cake to look fabulous."
4,Another Good Novel by Taylor Caldwell,"This the story of Melissa Upjohn and her fathers vicious attempt, from the time she is a child, to destroy her soul, her mind, and her future. Melissa must succeed in overcoming this evil which she has never suspected while trying to keep her marriage together. She must also endure the plotting of her sister in law, Arabella, and her own sister Phoebe.Once again the ""innocent"" trait is strong in this book as in ""Ceremony of the Innocent"", but I assure you there is no formula that Taylor Caldwell uses. This book, though it had a similar theme, was unique from the others. Overall, it is a good book, and I believe those who read it will like it. Though it is not my favorite of Taylor Caldwell's, it is definitely a good story and well written at that."
1,I would give it no stars if that were possible,"Sorry, I can see I'm the party pooper here, but I couldn't even make it through the book. I was bored out of my gourd. The pace is super slow, the narratives verbose. I will admit, however, that this genre is not my bag. It's like most of the classics I've read...it's very dark and ""Wuthering Heights"". So I will concede that the style of writing and storytelling is not my preference. If you're a fan of Taylor Caldwell's writing, then you'll probably like the book. Chances are her other books are similar styles.I would give it NO stars if that were possible. My mom read it and enjoyed it. Said it was ""quite different"". Quite different indeed :-)"
4,very weird,"I give this four stars because to give it three stars would misrepresent the effort and skill that the writer put into the story. However, when I first read this story AS A CHILD, I thought the story was pretty bad and unwholesome and really was not happy that I had read this. In hindsight, the book described two people who had narcissistic personality disorder and one of them was a psychopath. It was a pretty sophisticated book with many details but at the time, I was creeped out and almost had a heart attack reading it."
3,"Great Chess Writer, but ...","I believe that Yasser Seiran is one of the best chess writers, at least for players of my level.Really his books are a sort of fun above educational.I have other titles for the same author with better ratings than the one in hand. This title has many pages that do not realy add to the value of the book. Also, the coverage of the subject is some how shallow.I know that writing for this subject is not an easy task but the book in hand did not provide enough info to the average player."
1,Some bad mistakes,"I tried the openings in this book in the schools chess tournament. They lost in every game I used, but when I tried other openings, like Ruy Lopez and NimzoIndian they won. This guy suggested some loser openings for you. I liked getting the book IDEAS BEHIND THE CHESS OPENINGS by the author Ruben Fine. This was much better, and he told my why to play the moves better."
4,Solid instruction,"A book designed to feed upon the urge to ""get through the opening."" This is not an opening book; rather it gives an overview of the openings with emphasis on control of the center.The first few chapters deal with modern defenses: 1. e4 e5 and 1. d4 d5. Seirawan goes move by move, exploring natural alternatives for White and Black. The method used is useful for the beginner, and it serves as a useful grounding in ""classical"" chess openings.The next few chapters deal with openings that involve different move orders. A major drawback of the book is that it does not heavily discuss openings that start with moves other than 1. d4 or e4. 1. Nf3 is discussed (and recommended) but 1. c4 is not to be found.Recommendations as to what to play against 1. d4 and 1. e4 as well as a recommended opening for White (1. Nf3) round out the book.Not Seirawan's best work, but suitable if you do not understand the logic of the opening."
4,Fantastic book!,"This book really helped understand the why and how of the classical openings. Yasser explains in detail to the reader the strategies behind the openings. I learned alot and improved my game immensely after reading this book. However, I must agree with one of the above readers that the book does not include 1. c4. I have a chess computer that often starts with 1. c4 and beat me everytime! I was desperate and somewhat dissapointed when I could not find this opening in WCO because I know/knew Yasser could do an awesome job of explaing this ""reversed secilian"" opening. I hope he introduces an updated version of WCO"
4,Beautiful piece,"A really lovely cross. I have it hanging in my dining room. Only drawback is that the part that holds the candle is not as stable as the rest of the cross. I have a candle sitting on it but haven't actually lit it because I'm not 100% confident that it will stay put. In spite of that, I'm still really glad I bought it."
3,Seed falls out easily,"Nyger food is expensive to begin with...and I reuse/refill my socks, but these have such an open mesh the seed falls out very easily. Kaytee please revise your finch feeder socks with a finer mesh."
5,Welcome home Roscoe Jenkins,"The package was mail very quickly. The DVD was is great shape, it also played with no problems. I would recommend this method of purchase in the near future."
3,IT WAS OK,"IN THIS LAUGH OUT LOUD COMEDY, MARTIN LAWRENCE STARS AS A SUCCESSFUL DAYTIME TALK SHOW HOST WHO RETURNS TO HIS SMALL TOWN FAMILY FOR HIS PARENTS 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. IN JUST ONE WEEKEND AN ALL STAR CAST OF OUTRAGUOUS & LOVABLE CHARTERS PUTS HIM THROUGH ONE HILARIOUS PREDICAMENT AFTER ANOTHER BEFORE HE FINALLY LEARNS ABOUT THE TRUE MEANING OF FAMILY."
3,Decent But Definitely Not Hilarious,"Its hard to build a story around humor that relies on playin the dozens, particularly during scenes intended to be serious.Someone needs to tell Monique that saying something stupid loudly doesn't make it funny. Her big mouth overshadowed the content of every scene. She seems like a beautiful person, but that is not the issue. (Shouting ""How was your weekend?"" to my asian drycleaner won't make him say ""Fine. And you,"" instead he nods and half says ""Yeah, Thank you."")If you have nothing better to do, it is worth a watch. Martin and Ced are funny until they stop acting like comedians. Epps has gotten funnier. And there are several nice cleavage shots."
4,Great but dirty,When i got it it was very dirty and i was thinking that it was going to come in a case but it came in a cd case instead but overall its good
1,What a disappointment!,The dvd showed up with clearly visable deep scratches embedded within it. The seller should have at least looked at the product before selling it. The dvd doesn't play well at all. Scenes are totally skipped and it freezes throughout the entire movie. Not good at all.
3,dvd roscoe jenkins,it was ok funny and i will witch again in a mo or so will also tell a few friends about it
4,Great Cast,"I like watching movies where the family is a central character. Reminds me of Big Fat Greek Wedding. There's something fun about how a family shapes the central character and how that central character tries to find his or her own identity.An excellent cast of smart actors make for a very funny film, but also a heart warming film. And each character is distinct. Well-played by the actors. Sometimes you get family movies where two or three characters are the same, but what makes this move stand out is each character had its own personality and shaped the film. Each character had fairly equal screen time yet still maintained the story-line. That's pretty good writing.I definitely have to give two thumbs up to Mo'nique because she played her character to the T. I wasn't sure if she was really acting or adlibbing, but it was entirely believable.Definitely worth a watch and very entertaining."
4,Entertaining flick,"This movie features a good ensemble of actors - Martin Lawrence, Cedric the Entertainer, James Earl Jones, Michael Clarke Duncan, Mo'Nique, and many others.Roscoe Jenkin's problems with his family are illustrated in flashbacks, which give a good background for his current estrangement with his family and his desire to become rich and successful through his 'Team Of Me' concept. His finance is also funny and the actress who did her did a fine job at crafting her character, and the rivalry between Roscoe and his cousin and his problems with his father are nicely illustrated.All in all, this is definitely a solid film that is worth watching at least once. There's so many funny bits and excellent characterizations that it is hard to not enjoy this film."
3,Mo'Nique,"This is another opportunity to watch the great, funny Mo'Nique at her always best form prior to Precious that won her an Oscar. Otherwise this black dysfunctional family holiday gathering movie features some funny dialogue and is uniquely well directed which makes this otherwise familiar storyline worth watching and adding to your collection if you're an avid film buff."
2,What were they thinking,"Look! I love James Earl Jones, Martin Lawrence, and even crazy Mike Epps, but this was a lousy movie and I am glad. . . so glad I didn't pay $10.00 to see it in the movies. If you want to purchase this movie, wait until the price goes down, which I'm sure it will or borrow it from the library, because it sure isn't worth what I paid."
1,I NEVER GOT THE DVD THOUGH I PAID FOR IT!,"I never got the movie like I said though I paid for it. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it because it was only $5.10, but I did contact the seller a few times with no reply, not once."
1,Did not laugh once during this movie. . .,". . . not even a chuckle. If you think farting during yoga is funny, this movie is for you. If you think having a big dog jump on someone is funny, this movie is for you. If you laugh your head off because the airline loses Martin's luggage and he's forced to wear silly clothes, this movie is for you. For everybody who has already graduated from the third grade, look elsewhere."
2,DVD,The DVD I purchesed skips or stops in the middle but continues after stoping and doing a go to screen jump didnt reply to the seller. purchesed several DVDs from diffrent companys so was unshure who the purchase was from and I was out of town when I watched it the first time. havent taken the time to figure out or reply to the seller.
2,Yawn,"I usually enjoy Martin and Mo'nique , but even these super talented performers couldn't save this snoozer. My main critique is this veryredundant story line. City slicker comes home for family get together in "" Georgia "". This story is getting done to death, and this one isn't really funny"
3,Funny and Mindless Movie,This is a good movie if you are stressed and don't want to deal with a subject matter that is too serious or heavy. Lots of laughs.
3,Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins,"I believe the movie is worth seeing,but I couldn't see it because it was scratched so badly."
5,Quick and Easy,"This book is a terrific resource for those interested in exploring Indian style cooking. Easy to read format, glossary and clear step by step instructions makes even preparing two dishes simultaneously relatively easy. As Alameilu indicated in class, these recepies are very forgiving. This evening I botched up the Cauliflower Kootu and it still got the thumbs up from our family. Need a low-fat, low-cal side dish to compliment your (veggie)burger? Our favorite is the Cabbage and Coconut Poriyal - better tasting, and better for you than french fries. Nutritional info is available for those who are needlessly concerned about such things - with these recepies you can't go wrong.This book is a great addition to my other Indian cookbooks...enjoy it!"
5,Healthy South Indian Cooking by Alamelu Vairavan,"This cookbook has become my bible. Personally, I instantly became one of Alamelu's many enthusiastic fans after having the pleasure of attending one of her popular cooking courses. The class experienced many of her tantalizing dishes firsthand, which she followed straight from her cookbook. Alamelu's wonderful personality reflects in her book as well, with colorful, descriptive ""background"" information to enjoy (such as the benefits, beyond seasoning, of certain spices) in addition to her delicious, healthful and easy-to-follow recipes."
5,South Indian cooking - the best,"This is a fantastic book for people concerned with a healthy lifestyle. South Indian cooking is easy , delicious and healthy. This is book worth buying."
3,Mixed feelings,"I enjoy collecting good cookbooks. This one is just OK compared to my other books in the collection, including ""Samayal"", ""The Complete Asian Cookbook"" etc. The book definitely could use a better layout with pictures scattered throughout the book and not just in the middle. To me, pictures speak a thousand words, especially when it comes to food and I believe it makes it interesting too."
4,"Easy, Healthy and Very Tasty","I just purchased Healthy Indian Cooking from amazon.com and already I'm impressed. I live in the city of Philadelphia where there are many wonderful Indian restaurants. I have several Indian cookbooks but this one has quickly become my favorite. The recipes I have tried so far are easy and just plain delicious. Even though I did not have some of the ingredients on hand, I took the advice of Alamelu and Patricia and started having fun in the kitchen. I've made the lemon rice, masoor dal supreme, eggplant masala and chickpea and bell pepper poriyal. I found each dish to be fresh tasting and perfectly spiced. I can't wait cook my way through this book! Many thanks to Alamelu Vairavan and Patricia Marquardt for writing such a wonderful cookbook."
3,Avoid the kindle edition,"This review is a warning about the kindle edition. There is no way to find recipes because the page numbers in the table of contents and index do not match the kindle ""page numbers"". Also, there are no photos. I returned the kindle edition and plan to buy the hard copy."
4,Healthy South Indian Cooking,"Recipes are easy to follow, wish that there were more illustrations though."
3,Very interesting,"Always wanted to try Indian cooking. Saw this chef on tv, looked great. Tried some recipes , they are excellent. Won't use it everyday but often."
2,recent purchase,"As someone who's regularly buying JFK VHS tapes from Amazon this one's definitely a disappointment.the content the quality of the inaugural speech,absolutely depressing.the length,its over before you can yawn.I've purchased some nice ones but this ain't got it.up to you but as a die hard JFK freak i wouldn't bother."
4,Someone must have listened!,"My review of the Season 1 DVD was constructive criticism of the packaging and the way the DVds were. It seems that someone must have listened! These discs are silver colored,and have serpeate titles for each episode. There is also an option to add 5.1 surround sound.However,there are no still no closed captions,nor are there subtitles (in English, French, or Spanish)OK are you listening; Season 3 should include those captions and commentary on ""Accidents will happen"" from the writers of that epusode and Cassie Steele.while we're at it,Season 4's DVD should be in 16:9! and Season 5 should have much less of Craig. This is Degrassi,not the Jake Epistien show.Getting back to the season, the show was well done like the first season. Picture quality has improved on the DVDs. Each episode is presented as orginally directed,so When Doves Cry has the Craig tries to kill himself scene even CTV lacked the courage to show."
4,the continuation of something fake but lovely...,"...and the introduction to my favorite charactor, Marco! (and Ellie who i also love)! this show is super addicting and along with Noah's Arc it is one of my favorite guilty pleasures :) haha i love it. shut up."
5,Degrassi The Next Generation - Season 2,This is an amazing dvd set. I love Degrassi! I would recommand this to any teen who enjoys drama of true life event!
4,great upgrade from season 1,"I love the changes made from season one to season 2. For one, the characters such as Paige and Ashley go through some character development. It makes for a less stereotypical labeling. (i.e the cheerleader, the good girl, etc.) Also, the addition of alternative characters Marco, Ellie, and Craig bring a certain factor to the show that makes it less ""After school special"" than season 1.Beautifully done."
5,Much better than season 1,"Season 2 intoduces a couple of new charectors, Craig, Marco, and Ellie, as well as bringing Joey back after just two episodes the year before. It also deals with bigger issues, such as child abuse, rape, and homosexuality.When Doves Cry 5/5Girls Just Wanna Have Fun 5/5Karma Chameleon 5/5Weird Science 4/5Drive 5/5Shout part 1 and 2 5/5Mirror in the Bathroom 4/5Take My Breath Away 3/5Don't Believe the Hype 4/5White Wedding 4/5Careless Whisper 5/5Hot for Teacher 4/5Message in a Bottle 5/5Relax 1/5Dressed in Black 5/5Fight for Your Right 5/5How Soon Is Now 5/5Tears Are Not Enough part 1 & 2 5/5"
3,not much support,boxers fit great but not much cup support. during an active day they seem to wander. If you know what I mean.
3,Just OK,"The material is average, and tended to stay stretched out after only a few months. The elastic is pretty comfortable though. My only other issue is that they tend to ""ride up"" fairly quickly as well."
2,boss boxer's too short,"Nice material. horrible fit. have to wear them low to avoid a wedgie. would not purchase them again. like the boss tee's, durable, comfortable, great fit, great all around."
5,Nothing will distract you from the TV while watching.,"Temptress was a creative film full of erotic mystisism. ""Karen"" is an about-face from Kim Delaney's role on NYPD Blue as the reserved Diane Russell. The story development was somewhat predictable and the final resolution at the end was rather quick but the film is full of action that will keep your eyes glued to the TV. This is Kim Delaney at her best."
1,The unit is not funtional after only 4 months of use,My microtrak was not funtional after only 4 months of normal use. I wrote to M-audio custom service and they told me that they could not help me because I live in Mexico even and when M-audio has a dealer in Mexico City(I buy the unit by internet in USA). According with item warranty I have try to send my microtrack to microtrack technical servie for repair but they don't answer my emails. What kind of product is that dont have a custom service for possible future technical problems. Now I losed 400 dlls.
3,Disappointed,"I followed the same exact instructions for 3 days before this device even looked alive and had a light blink. Each time I use it I must charge the battery. When it is charged I have only 12 minutes of recording time and if I try to record more than one track, it tells me the darn thing is full - even if it's only 8 of the 12 minutes that I have used.Okay I got passed that then it was trying to email a file. All the computers I tried have Windows XP. I could not attach or send the .wav in Yahoo, Outlook, or Hotmail. So I decided to save it to CD. I've got to get tracks to a studio for a CD I am creating - I still have not been able to get one darn track on a CD successfully.The entire reason I bought this device was to email a .wav to the studio I use. That being the case - it doesn't work for me."
1,Recorder doesn't work,"I bought this item for my wife for Christmas. She could never record anything because it always said that the memory card was full. It was a brand new card, so we know there was nothing on there. We tried re-formatting the card several times. Then I updated the firmware. At the very end of the update it turned off and I couldn't turn it back on. After trying for two days to call tech support I finally got through. They said they knew about that defect, and I would have to ship it back (at my expense). So, now I'm waiting to get it back. They say it can take three weeks. GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT THIS TURNED OUT TO BE!!!"
1,sad product,"The battery is worthless, and must be replaced at the factory when it fails...and it fails early. Do not buy this product. Stay away from M-Audio altogether. There are better alternatives."
1,Look for something else,"The microtrack will not hold a charge by itself or even operate very long when hooked up to an external usb battery pack. It just drains away under charge. The concept for this a pretty good , but the implementation woefully lacking almost to the point where I may not reliably recommend to others."
2,"Would be great, if it worked","A friend of mine in audio production convinced me to buy this hunk-a-junk, and on paper, it sounds pretty good. In reality, though, it's a flimsy, poorly designed and built waste of money.First of all, it's a mechanical dud. True to billing on sites like Amazon, the battery lost all its storage capacity in a matter of months (at a fairly low usage rate). Now, 18 months or so after purchase, the unit is dead. It'll turn on, but it simply won't record. I've updated the firmware, I'm using legit storage -- it's simply busted. And of course, the warranty's up.Even when it was working right, I didn't love the machine. Its interface is klunky and its form factor is ugly. I'm not even sure why I'm giving it two stars instead of one."
4,adding and Auxilery Battery makes this a better tool,"After owning a Microtrack for a couple years and paying the factory to change a dead internal battery for $75 which then died dead 8 mos later I carefully pried open the back case, unsoldered the poor excuse of a battery from the small circuit board that is under the tape in the top of the battery and attached an external 3 AA battery holder (Allied Electronics 839-2487 with velcro to the back cover then wired a Radio Shack 2 conductor plug on the outside of the case so the battery case is field changable quickly. With 3 Li-ion AA batteries installed it charges fine and lasts way longer than the stock setup - so far I have run it 3 hrs and not killed the battery. Now its a true field recorder."
4,It's a great tool to work with!,"Except that the battery doesn't last too long, and that the batteries aren't replaceable so when you are somewhere you can't recharge it, then there is no other way to keep recording... Big drawback when you are on the road or in nature, perfect to record in studio situations."
5,M-Audio MicroTrack II,M-audio is a class act. When the MicroTrack II I ordered came in time for the children's Christmas Pageant I was happy. Then it failed out of the box. I called and after a brief talk with Glen they overnighted me a replacement and paid to ship the defective unit back. I still had it for the Christmas Pageant(two days to spare). The unit functions beautifully! I have recorded several things now and transfer of the digital files to my computer are simple. Wow what a wonderful product.
4,Beautiful scenery with its remarkable sounds.,"If you are interested in watching scenes of rural Vietnam, this may serve to become one of your collection. The sounds of rivers and water buffaloes which are blended with the rural landscape appear to be in harmony which sometimes make the viewer feel that he is in there. Although the cinematography is well worth it,the plot is rather weak and some of the scenes appear dragging which reminds me of some articles in National Geographic Magazines. However, the actors and actresses I think did their part well. We would welcome more movies about Vietnam."
2,not great,"with only 2 garlic cloves, it's hardly worth it. the directions say to do a lot of cloves. defeats the purpose of buying it. how often do you do a whole head of garlic."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Sure, it cuts things, but the blades don't have enough force behind them that it cuts into them and drags them around. No matter how little or how much I add to this, it doesn't cut all the way through items and sure doesn't chop. I would suggest a small food processor if you are looking at this item."
2,Music was very good,But the record was in a bad condition. It jumps and start again and again from the track 1. Not very happy whit that. Many greekrecords Ive bought have that same problem.
3,Interesting Read,"I kind of had more expectations for this book after seeing the movie, which was a flop. As you know the book is almost always better than the movie. It's well written and definitely interesting, but the story line is, well, absent, I think it's just different groups of people that happen to have linked lives. I wouldn't read it a second time."
4,Great Collection of Stories,"This is a good collection of stories that chronicle a small yet interesting slice of 1980's Los Angeles. The stories are all vaguely related to one another, but stand on their own just as well. They cover lots of terrirory including, but not limited to, pill poppers, vampires, and family relationships. Definitly worth a look if you like Ellis, and probably worth a look even if you don't."
1,The Informers is disconnected and basically nothing new.,"I was not entirely disappointed with The Informers. Perhaps this is because I did not expect too much. Nevertheless, I was still underwhelmed. Ellis has talent as reflected through his use of language and his expertly crafted characterizations. What he lacks, however, is an ability to develop new and original ways of using these characters to tell a story that has a point. Also, what of these people in this time and age? Did they learn anything? Are they even alive? He doesn't really make me care."
1,Ellis phoned in this effort,"As I read ""The Informers"", I thought I had mistakenly picked up a really bad copy of a ""Beverly Hills 90210"" script. This is vapid, humorless writing. Bret Easton Ellis CAN write, he just forgot how when he began this ""novel""."
1,The Informers was Nothing,"I gave up on this book after 130 out of 225 pages. The book was recommended on NPR as good vacation reading. The characters did nothing, said nothing, and did not interact. All they did was take Valium and Librium because they were so bored. The author did not convince me that their nihilistic lives were interesting enough to waste any more of my vacation time on their boring lives."
3,informers,"Not ellis' greatest work to date, but not bad. Much like Less Than Zero with a touch of American Psycho. Worth reading."
1,Don't waste your time.,"In a nutshell, I just didn't get it. I found it boring and pointless. It's been a few years since I read it so I don't remember the details; I just remember being very disappointed since I liked Less than Zero and The Rules of Attraction. I think Rules holds up better over time as I've re-read them both. I still find it funny. Zero, while it had an impact on me at the time (early 20's in college) seems sort of pointless when re-read in my 30's. Maybe that's the point. It speaks only to a particular segment of our population. I hated American Psycho on the first read. Liked it a little better the second time because I new what passeges to skip (long, detailed explanations of clothing, stereo equipment and Huey Lewis."
2,Ellis encapsulates his theme in the proper space this time.,Ellis redoes this theme over and over but in this collection of connected short stories he catches his morally and spiritually bankrupt vision of society in the best package to date. For once the voices vary slightly and Ellis opens up so many passageways for the mind to go which keeps pages turning. Some parts are overdone and the whole violence scheme is worked in but this is Ellis' best work to date.
1,wasted talent,"That is the sad thing, because he is a talented writer, but this novel says nothing. Some of the quotes on the back of the book truly amaze me. To say that this is an ""important book"" or to compare him to truly great writers like Fitzgerald is simply ludicrous. He has not earned that comparison yet. He has potential, but he needs to really work hard and write something worth reading, not this sad, empty, self-pitying, and egoistic [stuff]. Hey, Bret, here's an idea....write a story."
2,Going through his hoops,"The Informers is a novel composing of fragmentary stories mixing up characters who are distinguished only by their conformity. They are all rich, all tan, all psychically rootless and morally deracinated, and all dysfunctional. They go through life as beneficiaries of capitalism, with no apparent purpose other than to enjoy pleasure in capsule form, take drugs, drink and discuss and 'enjoy' their material wealth. Ellis has done this theme before in his early 20s novels. Reading it is rather like the sensation when you are hungover or exhausted - you are successfully numbed into a world which is not entirely unpleasant, but you can't do anything constructive.American Psycho, which preceeded this work, was a masterpiece - justly one of the top novels anywhere of the past 20 years. But this novel lacks the arrowing Celine style satirical bite and bats forward cliches of the mindless super rich in capsule form."
3,Had Its Moments,"Short stories set in the early 1980's, mostly in southern California. The themes that fascinated the young Ellis are here, as are certain foreshadowings of later projects (the vampire cult of serial killers in one story could almost have been precursors of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho). A few of these tales are self-indulgent to the point of them nullifying any quality they possess because of their smothering shallowness, but there are several works here that stand out. Mostly these stories are character sketches and scenarios and lack anything like rigid plotlines. Fans of Bret Easton Ellis should enjoy these early writings but the average person is not going to feel comfortable with the subject matter or the way Ellis at this point of his career was given so much license to write whatever he felt."
2,Ellis's Worst Effort Thus Far,"Don't get me wrong - Bret Easton Ellis is one of my favorite authors - along with Chuck Palahniuk and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. So...needless to say having read Ellis many times over, I came in with lofty expectations which sadly went unfulfilled. I read an interview with Ellis where he stated that The Informers was merely a collection of short stories he had been working on for years in between novels when he had writer's block that were basically turned in to satisfy a publishing deadline - he did not expect them to ultimately to be approved for publishing.Now I know why, Bret. Somewhat enjoyable and recommended strictly for diehard Ellis fans. If you want real Bret Easton Ellis with much more depth, intensity & cohesiveness, pick up The Rules of Attraction, American Psycho, Less Than Zero or Glamorama - all superb and quintessential Ellis reading."
2,A lesser Ellis novel,"As a huge fan of Bret Easton Ellis' ""American Psycho,"" ""The Informers"" struck me as underwhelming. Viewed as a series of short stories, the book moves fast, intrigues, and works reasonably well. As a novel, however, Ellis has trouble weaving his characters from one story to the next (i.e. the narrator of one story might be a minor character in another, or only mentioned in passing). And, although it's part of his point in portraying the early-'80s L.A.-set milieu, all of the characters seem so shallow that they don't really grow identities; they all basically blend in with one another.I am, however, very much looking forward to the upcoming film adaptation. This is one case where the various stories might work better in cinematic terms, interlacing the characters in an Altmanesque fashion."
1,this is his worst by far,"this book is so pointless, so stupid, so vapid, that it defies one's spending money on it. I love Bret Ellis, but this is an insult, obviously a bunch of cutout narrative packaged together and called a ""novel."" It's not a novel. It's nothing. Save yourself the trouble read Less Than Zero or Rules Of Attraction and then stop while you're ahead"
2,A triumph of style over substance.,"This book is good in the same way ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" by Tom Wolfe is. Both were beautifully written in a microscopic sense, i.e. if you only looked at a paragraph, the author's ability to string words together is stunning. Both were somewhat confusing because of the scope of the subject they attempted to cover (Wolfe the degeneracy of the early 80s New York, Ellis the degeneracy of the early 80s LA). But the importance difference is that Wolfe had something to say about that degeneracy. Mr. Ellis simply had nothing to say in this book, and it showed. I may not be truly qualified to write a review on a book about 1985, as I was in 4th grade at that time. But to be honest, I thought this book was everything Ellis cut out of ""Less Than Zero"" plus a silly segment about a vampire. If you want to read good Ellis, read ""Less Than Zero"" and stop. Everyhting else is just a rerun."
2,Watermarked,"Unfortunately the product in question arrived in a state that was unsatisfactory, it had some form of watermark through the top of the pages and also some kind of sticky glue substance in a line down the front of the cover. On the upside the recompense was adequate and speedy."
3,You lost me Ellis,"This was my first book by Ellis and I really like the way he writes and the stories of ""the Informers"" captured me. But somewhere I got lost. I don't know if it was the book or just that I need to read it another time but to me the stories never tied together which I would think was the whole point of the book. I feel like the book should have needed another 150 pages to get together cause it wraps up really quickly at the end and I only ended up with a ""what? I don't get it!"""
4,An easy pleasure,"Very highly recommended, though you shouldn't expect anything dramatic, momentous. The writing is wonderful, not beautifully tight as in American Psycho, but with plenty to like. Some very nice passages and stories. It's also a book which once you've finished, you can easily re-open at almost any page and enjoy reading some more."
2,The Rules of Attraction,"The most interesting aspect of this book is its narrative structure. It combines multiple stories told in the first person by diverse characters, the events narrated are somehow connected although they don`t create a cohesive whole. Most of these characters are rich elistist, souless and hedonistic people from L.A. who can`t relate to those who surround them, living vapid lives in a mind-numbing loneliness. There are some good, intense and entertaining moments here, as well as a couple of repulsive ones. The ending result is uneven and, for the most part, as shallow as the lives of these cardboard characters. Some of this material reminds me of Martin Amis`s ""Money"" or Irvine Welsh`s ""Ecstasy"", however those books are a bit better. Still, this one is worth a look anyway. Mildly recommended."
3,A collection of short stories,"I went into this book thinking that it was a novel. Halfway into the book I realize that it is nothing more than a collection of short stories that are loosely related. Nowhere on the cover of the book does it say anything about stories. The stories all seem to be saying the same thing and sometimes seem monotonous. Give us something new besides the cocaine snorting, the lude popping, the nihilism, and the emptiness. All of this worked ten times better with LESS THAN ZERO."
1,I lost my time,"I've just read this book by Bret Easton Ellis and I wonder how come he's so well considered in the new wave of American literature. It was the first book I've read of him but I don't think I'm gonna get over it. The only thing that was in my mind was the adjective ""impossible"" because I did not find any of the stories possible or some kind of reality. Does this world exist somewhere in the world? I don't think so. In the Italian version -the one I read - the cover said it was a mixture of horror and comedy well combined together. In fact, I think the editor lost some paper and I lost my time"
2,too disjointed,"IF you're into reading disturbing books that are POSSIBLY some reflection of our society, then you may enjoy this book. I found it unconnected and disjointed. Some characters connected, but others just appeared as a new member of the cast unconnected to anything.If you approach this as just a series of short stories, rather than a novel, I think you'll enjoy it much more. Didn't make me feel good, particularly introspective, or contemplative."
4,Creative blend of all genres.,"Be aware this is a book of SHORT STORIES. I did not realize this when I first began reading it because it did not say so anywhere in the book that I was aware of. Ellis sometimes rights from many perspectives and with many different story lines and in the end weaves them together, so I assumed this is what he was doing here. When I finally got to the story featuring a vampire I figured it out. Before that I kept saying, wow, he's really lost it this time.They are all pure Ellis tales that are good to read if you haven't read Ellis before. They will prepare you for what is to come in his other novels."
5,Excellent product,This vertical organizer is very well made and exactly what I wanted to organize paper and envelopes in our hall closet.
3,Sort of fun,"Good idea, though when my hamsters first got on it, it scared them. The construction is a bit awkward, and it doesn't ""swing"" as freely as I had hoped. My dwarf hamsters love going through the holes in the sides and climbing all over it."
3,Way too general,"Even though many teachers recommend this book, its information is way too general for a serious botany course. For example, if you want information on about Division Anthocerotophyta, you'll only find about 5 paragraphs. It is a good book for general doubts, but once you want deeper knowledge, I would really recommend Bold's Morphology of Plants and Fungi. Don't be tacken aback by its publication date (1987): it is still the most used and reverenced book on the subject. It's the Bible of botanists (just like the Alberts for Molecular Biologists), and it will come in handy whenever you study algae or fungi also."
4,Bio of Plants,"This book is great. It has detailed descriptions, good questions, and great photographs to reinforce the topics. I use this book for a college course and it is extremely helpful in filling in the details or gaps of what the professor glosses over. I highly recommend using this book."
2,Watch out,"I got this book in a reasonable time frame but, its binding is coming undone and needs to be fixed. It works ok for my class but I would watch what the description DOESN'T say about the product and ask about it."
5,Like New,"Was like new, a few minor peelings, really nothing at all, great price for a great botany book ! !"
3,Its a book,"So, its a book. You might need it for class. I think it does an alright job. It does like to go into the history a lot though, it always mentions which plant from what era, which is great if you need that. But since I'm using it for a morphology class I don't need the dates as much as the facts."
1,Not for Non-Botanists,"I have a strong background in biology but I was still confused by a lot in this book. I hadn't taken botany classes before so I don't know all of the terminology. This book would be using advanced plant terms without ever explaining them. I was constantly looking things up on the internet because the words weren't even in the glossary. If you have a choice, don't get this book."
4,Text Book,The delivery was quick and efficient which was helpful to start a new quarter of using the book. The tex was heavily highlighted which isn't a bad thing it just wasn't expected to such a magnitude.
3,Biology of Plants,It took a little longer than I would have preferred to be mailed to me. But what can you say when delivery is FREE. Some of the pages seemed to have some kind of yellow solution spilt on them and all over the side of the book. It was dry by the time it got to me and I had no time to send it back since it came two weeks after me class had already started.
4,No side effects,While I can't say it is the right product for what ales me? I have no problems with it :)
5,James Ford's Warm View of Zen in America,"James Ford has written a book that serves multiple purposes and done it with a clear, warm and inviting voice. If I weren't already practicing, this book would have served to nudge me along to seek out the Way that Ford lovingly has laid out for us. Zen Master Who contains a straightforward introduction to the basics of Buddhism and of Zen. It covers the basic practices of Zen, providing lucid explanations of the various meditation methods pursued by Zen practitioners -including koan practice. It also traces the history of Zen in in the West and talks about both the early pioneers and the present day schools, including his own. The book is worth it simply for the advice on how to choose a Zen teacher. Zen Master Who works as a book for someone completely new to Zen and for those who have practiced for years and who wonder about what is going on in practice centers across North America."
2,Hole not drilled in the right spot,"I bought this to replace the factory adapter that got lost for my 2011 GMC 2500HD. It works okay, but the hole is not really positioned where it needs to be. If I put it in the hitch with the short end in, the amount that sticks out is too long to insert my hitch. If I put the long end in first, the hitch goes in with not enough support and is loose.I may just use my torch and notch out some of the long end so I can put it in short end first. Unfortunately, I will have to prime and repaint the tube."
4,Great Album,"This has to be my first Beres Hammond album, and Im upset i didnt discover him sooner. His sounds, melodies, and lyrics take you to another place. I love all 19 tracks."
3,Beres is the Smokey Robinson of reggae,"Not as many great songs as the last two, but it's still Beres so you gotta love it"
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"This CD could have been much better. It is not good as his previous ones. I rush to get this one, but only to be disappointed."
5,Good price.,Same as all the rest. Good siner. Loves his songs. I have been listening to Beres since he first started sining. Cannot forget how his first songs were hits.
1,I don't like briefs ...,What can I say - I don't like briefs. My butt doesn't feel any better enclosed in some fabric.
3,Parent alert,"Watched with my children. No big laughs here, just some chuckles. We absolutely love comedy. (Tim Hawkins and Brian Regan are our favs). Completely agreed with ""Rizzo's"" review. Felt exactly the same about lack of energy and sooo slow and using halting lame fillers to segue between each monologue topic unlike most comedians who know how to do it seemlessly. Also, beware Henry mentions a story about his dad ordering a ""quickie"" (meant quiche) at a restaurant. I'm cringing waiting for the ""mom, what's a quickie??"" Thankfully it just went over their heads, but yours may be more inquisitive so be warned.. It really is clean other than that reference and the use of the word Pis--d if that's offensive."
3,I wish...,Henry Cho would concentrate more on the humor of growing up as a Korean in the South. I felt he tried to hard to just be a southern boy - while ignoring the huge treasure trove of humor that is his background. His funniest lines (except for Jonely Bonely) were about his family; I wanted to hear more about them.
3,"Henry, WHAT HAPPENED!?","I have enjoyed Henry Cho at his best, I mean real ""funny"". This dvd ""What's That Clickin' Noise"" is not that good. He often tells the audience that something is funny, no hearty laughs with this one. Sort of left us ""ho hum""."
4,Great family-friendly humor,"Henry Cho is a very funny storyteller and frequently remarks that he gets much of his material simply by relating his experiences with family and friends. Raised in the only Asian family in a southern town, Henry's stories show the funny side of our cultural differences and our similarities. His show is family friendly: there is no profanity, not even any risque stories. The entire family can sit and enjoy this together."
3,Pretty good.,"I have to admit, there's nothing else in this special that's as funny as the one joke I remembered (J only, B only), but it's a pretty entertaining DVD nonetheless."
3,brings back memories,"some of the recordings are a little rougher than i remebered, but piss off it's punk rock"
3,An average Star Trek novel,"I read this book because Vulcans are my favorite ST aliens and because D.C Fontana has traditionally gotten good reviews as an author. While the story was detailed and captivating, I was disappointed by the character development. It would have been better written as a general sci fi novel where it could have introduced new characters and alien races, rather than playing off of those we already know. The characters never felt ""real"" to me and I found many of their actions unbelievable when compared to how they are portrayed in the actual series. Overall, it was a good story. But I do not rank it as one of my favorite Star Trek novels."
3,Vulcan pride at it's best,"This book lets you into some of the working of vulcan marriage rituals, and it shows exactly how far vulcans will go to hide a lie. Scotty makes this story good his charcter was my favorite in this story."
4,D.C. Fontana did it again,"This was the first Star Trek book I ever read. And it was good.To read about Spock's first mission, and see Scotty when he first joined the Enterprise crew is just fun!"
5,Beautiful set of cards,"I am a Reiki practitioner and bought these after attending an archetype workshop. The artwork on the cards is really nice and it was fun going through them and picking out the ones that fit my personality and friends' personalities. You can lay the cards out in front of you and get a clear picture of your archetypes, and the little booklet that came with it to describe each card was really helpful and interesting."
3,Good but not a lot of content on what to do,I like the cards I have the book. But I wish the cards would have some of the content on steps to work toward alignment like in the book.
1,Very dull,"Sorry, but expectations from A carolyn Myss Archetype card system have been floored. This deck of cards has no inspiration, nor enough data to support the cards for a good reading, let alone an indepth serious one. Even the Graphics are not adding any spice, or direction to rev up your imagination, and/or intuition. Could do all without cards too. :-)"
5,The Archetype Cards are a Fabulous Writer's Tool,"These cards are great as a writer's tool. I bought The Archetype Cards by Caroline Myss to help in my writing.I shuffle the cards deal out 3 or 4 depending on how many characters I need and then use my creativity to write a story.Long or short, complex or simple these cards are great for stimulating your muse and taking your ideas in unexpected directions as you write."
3,Archetype Cards Need More Content,"I have recently been very fascinated with Caroline Myss and was excited to get her Archetype Cards to enhance my understanding beyond listening to her CD sets, but I was disappointed with the cards and the booklet that came with them because, although they are pretty with wonderful artwork, the content and the expanded learning is just not there for me."
1,Golden trumpet,"I was very sorry to have bought that CD.The choice of the songs is terrible:Only the first was a well known Melody,while all others were forsaken, unknown,banal mellodies."
1,Garbage,Just a cheap spring type thermometer that was close to ten degrees high when I compared it to a digital thermometer in a shady location. Don't throw away your money on this.
2,Spiral binding misleading,"I like Rosemond's columns, but this ""book"" is disappointing. It's about the size of a desktop tear-off calendar with the printing horizontal so the spiral binding is on the top. Each page has a sentence or two of ""non-contextual"" advice tidbits. If they'd left room for appointments & actually made it a calendar it might have been useful for a year. As is, the format is illogical at best and the daily quotes really don't relate to any particular topic."
3,The Book Review from the back,"Priscilla Burbage was no ordinary ghost. Winsome and mischievous, she had a penchant for causing trouble. And Laura Daniels was her latest victim.When Laura first moved into her old Victorian house in Port Dudley, Priscilla decided to find her a husband. Carter Kincaid was the perfect candidate. Unforunately Pricilla wasn't aware that Carter reminded Laura of her late husband. And Laura wasn't going to make the same mistake twice!"
2,"Awesome when it works, FRUSTRATING when it doesn't.","Works maybe 60% times without any hassle, and when it's working it's awesome. It flies.But sometimes, *in the same places you've used it before without a hitch (e.g. same towers)* seemingly at random it will refuse to pick up 3G connections -- even when other devices on the same AT&T; network right beside it can continue using 3G data (e.g. iPhone & Blackberry). This will manifest itself in one of two ways:1. It won't see the 3G, only EDGE.2. It won't see any network at all -- not even EDGE.Usually, you can get the card to find 3G or EDGE after pulling the card and reinserting it multiple times, which is *incredibly* frustrating.It's not just my card, one of my co-workers had the same issues. It's unfortunate this card doesn't work 100% of the time because mobile broadband truly is a gift from heaven."
2,DISAPPOINTED FIRST TIMER,"I'M NOT SURE WHO TO BE MORE DISAPPOINTED WITH, THE PEOPLE WHO MADE AND MARKETED THE MOTORAZR V3XX PLATINUM OR THE AMAZON PEOPLE WHO PROMOTED IT AND THEN FAILED TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT WHEN IT DID NOT DELIVER ADEQUATE SOUND QUALITY. I CAN BARELY CARRY ON A CONVERATION USING THIS PHONE AS IT CUTS IN AND OUT AND QUALITY IS VERY ""TINNY"". PLEASE - BEFORE USING A THIRD PARTY TO BUY YOUR PHONE, KNOW THAT THE SELLER OF THE PHONE(AMAZON) HAS LIMITED RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT YOU ARE SATISFIED. I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO TRY TO SETTLE THIS MATTER WITH AT&T (WHO REFERS ME BACK TO AMAZON) OR THAT MY OTHER OPTION IS TO RETURN THE FULL ORDER (WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS THREE PHONES) AND THEN REORDER. ILLOGICAL - WHEN ONLY ONE PHONE IS DEFECTIVE."
1,NOT a replacement for BP 3220,"After borrowing my neighbor's BP 3220s I had to have my own--but the 3220 was discontinued. The 3220 was lightweight and easier for me to use than one-handed clippers. The length of the 3220 also made it amazingly good at getting into rose bushes, and clipping certain weeds at the stem without kneeling on the ground. These are significantly heavier. I might as well just lug around my bigger loppers. My neighbor is a strong man, but he didn't want the 3225s either, and wouldn't sell his 3220 for a lot more than I paid for the 3225s (drat). My advice, don't bother with these. They aren't up to the big jobs, but aren't light enough to pleasant to use and carry."
5,Practical Gardening Book,"I have used this book for gardening references many times.I got tired of borrowing it from library and decided it was time to get my own copy.I have used it to solve landscaping problems as well as planting information.You can't beat the Rodale name for great gardening information.There a lots of ""cute"" gardening books in my library with pretty pictures, but this one gets used the most.I even copy gardening home remedies in it so that I don't have to look them up elsewhere."
4,"Another fine offering, please judge it for what it is","This is a compilation of obcurities, and there's some fine work here. It shouldn't be judged as anything but. Thanks for listening/reading."
4,Solid play if a good novel and a fine film,"This is a solid play of a good novel, but it is unlikely that any viewer can see it without having first seen the film version with Ray Milland. The surprises and twists are all there and the dialogue works well. A solid play."
1,Packaging Problems,"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE PACKAGING NOT ABOUT THE FILMS.I had hoped to be able to watch these films. However, I can't. Why? Because for the third time an Eclipse series set has arrived in my hands damaged.So what happened? As is often the case with these small keep cases (see my discussion of the Milestone I am Cuba set) one of the discs of the set has fallen off its very tiny spindle (a spindle that isn't one of those press here to release the disc types) and been damaged in the process of shipping. For this reason (as well as for Criterion's patented lack of response to suggestion, in this case to the suggestion that they change the packaging so this doesn't happen) I recommend against buying this or any other of the Criterion Eclipse series. All in all this is too bad because the series offers interesting films (Criterion calls them your own personal cinematheque) at (for Criterion) reasonable prices. C'est la vie."
2,"Capsules, not tablets","I used to like the Bean-zyme tablets. They worked quite well, but these are capsules and don't seem to work nearly as well as the tablets did. Why did they change them?????"
3,Bean Zyme,Bean Zyme work for me only if I doubled the amount of required tablets. I have to take about 5 tablets at one time in order for them to work for me.
2,Bean-zyme Ingredients,"The main ingredient in this product is the same as Beano. However, several of the inactive ingredients are different -- like Bean-zyme has corn starch and sorbitol. So this is likely a good product if you're ok with their inactive ingredients. But they are ones we prefer to avoid so we're going back to Beano."
5,beanzyme is great!,i was really impressed with this product. when first taken with food it really does help to avoid excess gas from foods such as broccoli and beans. i would definately recommend it if you are the type who gets gassy easily. and its vegetarian!
3,Bean-Zyme,It a good product but doesn't always work and it's expensive!PS: I do not like your requirement for X amount of words!
2,This Product is Not as Effective as Beano,I have found Beano to be more effective. This product may be lacking key ingredients. It could depend on the individual.
4,As good as Beano but cheaper,I bought this to try out due to Beano's high cost. I found it works as well and is quite a bit cheaper. Works especially well for gas caused by an increased vegetable diet.
5,Bean-Zyme is the Greatest !,"Bean-Zyme works great for me.I don't know why, but for some reason Bean-Zyme works where Beano did not. I thought they were about the same, but when I took Beano, I still had plenty of gas. However when I take Bean-Zyme, the gas is nearly gone! Now I can enjoyably eat my beans!"
4,Bean-Zyme same as name brand stuff.,"This stuff works for me. I have to take 3 pills with first bite of food, then no or reduced gas.Costs less than Beano."
4,Bean-zyme works well,"Bean-zyme works for me just as well, if not better, than the Bean-o brand that I have purchased in local stores. I did have to get used to ""swallowing another capsule"" instead of chewing a tablet. I purchased this product because I needed a gluten-free alternative. I wish these were available locally in stores, because I like to be able to pick up a product right when I need it, and not have to wait for it to be shipped. It took about a week to get this product."
4,Works great,I only use this when I have indigestion. I drink prune juice and this helps with the gas it sometimes creates. Good product.
5,No more Beano,"I was a ""Beano user, but now there will BEANO more buying it because bean-zyme works great and has a great price!!"
4,Helps; but not a slam dunk,"Beanzyme ameliorates the gaseous effects of beans, but doesn't work very well with other foods, such as prunes and cabbage. Tastes okay; contains sorbitol, a natural sweetener. Does not contain wheat. Beano, a competing product with exactly the same active ingredient, does contain wheat according to the ingredients list on the bottle and according to a reaction I receive upon eating it. Consequently, Beano does not work as well as Beanzyme, at least for me. The wheat ingredient may not be an important factor for most people. Beanzyme is fairly effective, reducing bean related gas approximately 40-60%; so I recommend this product."
1,Does not work for me,"Product does not work for me. I went back to Beano, and Beano works great. Can buy Beano at Meijer. Same quantity and strength for dollar more."
3,Good price,"Good price versus Beano but I really haven't noticed much effectiveness yet...maybe it's just me. Again, can't go wrong with the price though."
1,NOT WORKING FOR ME,"I have been using this for a week, and it has not helped even once. I started with the recommended dosage of two tablets and then upped it to four. I tried both swallowing and chewing them, but they just aren't working for me. I went to Walmart today and bought some Equate Extra Strength Gas Relief to see if they will work any better."
1,maybe not necessary,"""Beans are excellent for overall health and the gas is actually a result of good bacterial growth in our intestines, in which the gas is temporary. Check out this non commercial science based article delving into detail [...]"
2,Hmmm...Wasn't this suppose to get rid of gas?,"Was excited to finally be relieved of gas... but I've found that following the instructions to the letter and I still get gas...just as bad...only with a different flavor! and whoa! what this stuff does when it comes out! That's the only reason for 2 stars...could be kinda fun if you want to pay someone back. ;)Overall, waste of money."
1,doesnt work,I recently had my gall bladder removed and gas is a HUGE problem-- Beeno works great but cost a lot. Thought I would try this to see- doesnt work. I continues to use this product thinking that it could build in my system and get better-- wrong-- doesnt work for me.
4,A Useful Good Value,"I bought this to go with my Haul-Hitch aluminum deck. The net installed quickly and relatively easily, and snuggly held a load of beach-gear in place on an 800 mile round-trip. The plastic hooks all stayed attached - however, they were slightly cut up from being attached to the holes in the aluminum frame, and some hooks were twisted. To correct this, I tied rope loops to each of the 12 holes in the aluminum deck frame. This has made it a lot easier to attach the hooks, and eliminated the problem of the plastic hooks being cut or twisted. With this simple change, I think the cargo net is a valuable and useful addition to my cargo deck."
1,Bad Investment,"Undersize bungee ropes(Weak),...cheap plastic hooks that break too easily and barely fit any holes on carrier.If you want your ""cargo"" all over the tarmack then buy this!"
3,Not bad but could be better,The system as a whole is good but the hooks are flimsy and feel unreliable and are bulky. On the other hand they are removable to be placed where you need them and the cargo net stretches very well.
3,Good overall but could be better.,"I got this net to go with my hitch-haul with rails. The net is a good size and works well. However the issue is with the hooks. They are made of plastic and the hooks are too small for the bars/tie down points. The bars + carrier + net are all the same brand so you would think that they're all made to work together. The hooks on the net are a bit too small, so when you hook them onto the rails or the tie-down spots the hooks get twisted. If it wasn't for that I would have gave a 5 star rating."
5,Excellent BIG knife,"An extremely good solid, BIG, folding knife at a great price.I say folding because this really is NOT a pocket knife....well at least not an EDC (every day carry) pocket knife.The reviewer who said it was a folding bowie in your pocket was not kidding.Seriously, get your ruler out and meassure to be sure you want this much knife. If you do, then you can't go wrong with this quality/price."
5,Most Significant Disney Book in 20 Years,"It was essential that this book be written. Bob Thomas has done a masterful job of telling the story of Walt Disney's older brother, Roy O. Disney. The life and work of this man has gone under-reported and under-appreciated for too many years. The book is filled both with wonderful stories of the early years for the Disney family, and of the struggle and hard work involved in establishing one of the most influential American companies of the 20th Century. Roy's story is told through the first hand accounts of both his family and co-workers. An absolutely fascinating read. Don't be surprised to see a television mini-series grow out of this one!!"
4,Enjoyable account of the company's less recognizable founder,"This book is a breath of fresh air if you've read some portrayals of Walt Disney and the controversies around his life. I realize that Bob Thomas's book on Walt (An American Original) is a bit rosey, but this volume on Roy seems a bit more objective (or less propaganda-ish). It gives you many quotes from current and former employees and does succeed in giving the reader a bit more perspective on Roy and his contributions to a great American institution. For the casual Disney fan, there is plenty of important Disney family and company background, and the book moves at a quick-enough pace despite the many facts to absorb. I recommend this book to all those interested in Disney history or trivia."
4,A Different View,I've read alot of books about Walt and alot of books about Disney. Reading about Roy offered a different and extremely interesting view. It also offers a great insight into how Roy was just as important as Walt in building the Disney Company. I learned from this book that none of us would know the name Disney today if it wasn't for Roy.
4,"Great shape, color",This is a great quarter sheetpan size. The density and dark color promote even-cooking and browning. It's a Great pan overall.
2,garbage,"I recieved this item, and other Caphalon bakeware for my bridal shower 6 months ago. I have used this pan about 4 times a month since then, and there is rust and crud in between the corners where the sides meet. The dark grey interior is chipping off in coin sized chunks. Looks great when brand new, but has not held up to normal use. My other Caphalon bakeware is showing similar wear and tear even though this is the most used piece. This brand is over-rated and overpriced, now I need to buy a new pan after only 6 months."
4,Interview with the Author,"As the Editor-in-Chief of EVWorld.Com, I had the opportunity to do an audio interview with Jack Doyle last week (June 15, 2000). We will be webcasting that interview in three parts on the EVWorld.Com web site starting the week of June 24, 2000. In the interview, Jack shares his experiences in writing Taken For A Ride. Having read the book in preparation for the interview, I found it a devastating indictment of the US auto industry who used its political and financial muscle to stall auto emissions technology and regulations for decades."
5,The perfect cup of tea,"When I could no longer drink coffee ( I loved it but it stopped loving me at age 50, making my nerves too jangly and insomniac for comfort) my favorite advisor about coffee and tea suggested I try Taylor of Harrogate""s Kwazulu Tea from South Africa. Enough caffeine to keep a busy evening nurse clear and running at San Francisco General Hospital, but no frazzled nerves, and deep sleep like a baby restorative rest once off duty. i love the clean, slightly bitter taste it gives to my palate; other black teas taste insipid by comparison. If you like English or Irish Breakfast Teas, you'll find Kwazulu Tea a magnificent improvement and frankly, never want to settle for anything less. It's sometimes a little difficult to find, but like the search for the Holy Grail, worth the pursuit. Shop around on the internet for the best price since there can be overpricing.A sante, as Julia Child always signed off."
5,Excellent for a Brit abroad,Perfect cup of tea. The best tea I have had since leaving the UK to live in the US. Worth the effort to use leaves instead of a bag. It's become our daily drinker.
3,Okay taste but cut fine for a loose tea,Much smaller cut than other premium teas I have bought. Taste is okay - you will need a fine mesh filter.
5,Childrens Religious Stories,I bought this for my granddaughter as she loves hearing all the religious stories. There are many books like this one and she likes one more than the other.
5,Starrett Center Punch,Quality piece and useful. Nice to see USA made tool. Feel and finish are top notch with knurled portion just where it is needed.
2,Caution-Looks can be mis-leading,"Be careful when ordering this; it looks like you are getting a Set of 6 Center Punches and the description also mentions ""ShankS"", but you will only received 1 small Center punch."
2,Picture of Product Misleading,"I thought I was getting a set based on the picture but it is only for one. Other than that, the tool itself is ok."
1,Despise false advertisement,"I would not purchase from this vendor because he use's a picture which makes the buyer think he is getting a set of punches, when in fact he is getting just one punch. Very misleading and for that would not buy ANYTHING from this vendor."
5,"sorry they are out of print, but glad you had them used!","This is an utterly charming postcard set from the covers of old sheet music. There is something for everyone here from 'Sierra Sue', to 'they're wearing 'em higher in Hawaii'. The art work is authentic and wonderful and the titles are so fun you come up with excuses to send out cards. Unfortunately for others, I think I bought up the last available sets. If not, and you come across a set, snatch them up. Particularly fun for music lovers."
5,A balanced treatment of globalization at last!,"This is the best book on globalization I have read. It is comprehensive in its treatment of this vast subject, but still has genuine thematic coherence. The authors have got the balance right between theory and historical evidence, and provide a systematic analysis. Organization is excellent and the arguments are easy to follow. I am especially pleased to see profound consideration of militarization included, a common omission in many texts. The only area that could have been stronger was technolgical change, although this is treated effectively in relation to certain issues, such as telecommunications. Overall, it is a first class work and I predict this will become the standard text on the subject for some years to come."
1,"boring, wordy, and dense...definite thumbs down","If your goal is to learn the effect globalization has on the state, society, and politics in general this book provides alot of information but it presented in a way that will put you to sleep.Instead of reading the chapters I would recommend going straight to the tables and grids provided because the author does not do a good job of getting to the point. I also found that the grids and tables were a good source of what each chapter actually summed up.I would, however, have to credit the authors for doing a thorough job of covering the various aspects of globalization- from patterns of global finance to global trade and markets to military globalization. Best chapter is the one that deals with migration-otherwise don't bother with this book- you would probably be better of with another book that covers globalization."
4,For serious space geeks,"There is no narrator to explain anything, very little on-screen information of any sort. Much of the footage is poorly lit; what is shown is obscure; sometimes there is no image at all, just audio. Yet here you will see some of the most incredible images in the history of mankind: men working and playing on an alien world."
3,To caught up in the hupe,"Despite all the glowing reviews for this book, it is fairly average.The author writes about how the internet will become an essential par of our lifestyles. Some of his notions are very interesting and could very well come true. But others are caught up in the hype surrounding the internet.One example is that furniture.com will be one of the 5 main retailers on the internet for home furnishings. He must have only read their press releases because this company has since filed for bankruptcy.This is an ok book that could have a must read if the author had been a bit more objective. I suppose only time will tell ..."
4,owl,I rc'vd my order the same week I placed it!!!!!! One of the few on line Xmas gift oders that did arrive in time for The BIG day!!!!!
4,A nice gift,"I bought these as a gift for my wife on Valentine's day. This design matched nicely with her Tanzanite and silver jewelry purchased on holiday in Cancun.The earrings are well made, the stones are set well, and the size is just right -- not overbearing, but visible to others. These earrings are not ""fancy"" jewelry, but casual and fun. I thought they were a nice value, and most importantly, my wife really likes them."
1,no support,I purchased this item. Works fine as a firewall router. But VPN features do not work. All email and web contact to manufacturer is blocked. The only way to get a fully functioning unit with technical support for setup is to buy a 1 year service contract for $179. Amazon should include a footnote to the item description on their site that technical support for this unit is only available at extra cost.
2,Form but not function,"I still like the look of the watch, but its maintenance is a nightmare. There are 2 batteries (one for the dial, and one for the LCD) which expire at different intervals. Only Fossil can do the service (replacing the batteries). The leather of the band is ok, but its two layers come unglued after about a year of use. My replacement band (purchased from Fossil) came unglued exactly as the original did."
3,well crafted tale of point-less-ness,"A well crafted book. I can believe it accurately reflects people's difficulties, however the overall tone of the book is depressing, aimless, and pointless. I would not rate it as highly as the Deerhunter, Dispatches, or P. Caputo's novels of Vietnam, which are all *very* depressing"
5,Nice collection of primary sources in English,"This is a nice book to get for anyone serious about studying early Korean History (pre-Yi dynasty). It gives you a taste of the Samguk Sagi, Samguk Yusa, The Chronicles of Koryo as well as early Wei China accounts and the controversial inscription on King Kwanggetto's Monolith. From these documents, you can learn, quite literally from the horse's mouth, the struggle of the Three Kingdoms against each other, the struggle of the later Three Kingdoms and the thought and philosophy of the people at that time. Please bear in mind, these are excerpts, not full texts of the primary sources. These only give you a taste and flavor of the full texts."
3,nick 30,"seems a bit dated and hard to understand. i'm not a tcm doctor, though have read many books in that field of study."
1,"I wouldn't buy again, terrible quality","I love Fiestaware, so I thought I would love this flatware. I bought 12 sets. Within 1 week one of my knives bottoms fell off. Super glued it back together. Within the next few months, a total of 27 pieces have broken or are totally bent. Usually what happens if the little circular clip where the metal meets the plastic falls off, then there is nothing left to keep the metal part from bending. I have talked to someone, they are going to replace these pieces for me, but it is just going to keep happening. I do have kids, who are probably rough with these - but they are flatware - they should be able to last longer than a year. I totally regret buying these, which I had invested in something different."
5,Great,"Wonderful album. 20 great songs (if you think 5 are filler, then you still have 15 good songs). Classic album."
5,One of the best latin bands.,"These guys are combining Rock with mexican rythms, I think you have to hear it to believe it. This Re cover is one of the best covers I've ever seen, made by my friend Sergio Toporek."
2,ingrata and thats it,i was disappointed by this cd. this was the first time i'd ever bought a cd de rock en español and well i expected more! there was the song ingrata and nothing else !
5,Flawless!,"Cafe Tacuba is the personification of today's Mexico. The band's flip-flop from one style to another only leaves you aching for more, even at the end of the 20-track disc. This sort of genius transcends language and culture."
5,A Latin masterpiece,"""Segundo Romance,"" the CD by Luis Miguel, is an excellent collection of Latin music. All the songs have Spanish lyrics. These songs are mellow, romantic ballads with a lush, classy orchestral backing. Luis Miguel performs each selection with a gentle, but smoldering, passion.My favorite songs on this disc are ""Sin ti,"" ""La media vuelta,"" and ""Delirio."" This is a wonderful CD that should come with the following warning: It may cause listeners to start passionately kissing somebody!"
4,Segundo Romance,Just became a fan of Luis Miguel. Love the songs on this CD like Somos Novios and Solanente Una Ves.I love his smooth voice.
3,"Great book, small print","I bought 3 of these as stocking gifts. I took a chance and ordered these after reading the other review about the small print. I have a similar book that is great and at least 10 years old. The print size is fine, even after 10 years with its toll on my eyesight. I agree that that the contents are great but l also agree that the print is too small. I ended up returning them after I found ""Golf Genie"", a similar product that was more $, but has more info, was a little larger, and had bigger print. In the end, I found several apps that I would recommend as a worthy alternative.Golf genie tee to green pocket guide"
2,Eh,I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It is very small and thin. He was not impressed with it and hasn't used it. I was disappointed with the product and his reaction. It may be more for very inexperienced golfers.
2,Good but not worth the price,Smells nice and lather is ok but not as good as national brands.Even being a moisture bar it is quite drying to the skin.Too bad I really wanted to like it but Dove/Dove Men is just better and costs 1/6th the price.
2,JUST LIKE REGULAR BAR SOAP,I FOUND THAT THE SOAP DRIED ME OUT JUST AS REGULAR SOAP DOES. I ALSO WAS NOT PARTIAL TO THE SMELL. NOT FOR ME!
2,useful vocabulary?,"Unlike their Level 1, I found this a very odd collection of words and expressions. It is disappointing. The format is nice though, allowing time to repeat (or guess) each word and phrase."
5,one of the best sports books--and books about commitment.,"This is a book for any thinking endurance athlete--and secondarily for anyone who wants to feel the ultimate meaning of the word ""commitment."" It's a bit frightening to see into the mind of a man like Brad Lewis, who trusts himself, through years of hard training, experimentation, and self-deceptionless self-scrutinizing, to know what he needs to do to achieve his goal. It's a human book, too; Lewis is no ""Terminator,"" willing to detsroy all in his path to reach his goal--but he can come close at inevitable moments of self-doubt and fatigue along the way. Some books can tell a good story; this one makes you live it as Lewis must have lived it. Tremendous book--and better the fourth time you read it. And you will. Buy five copies; you'll be giving them away as presents."
4,Inspiring & gripping - but knowledge of rowing helps,"This book is like a good thriller. It's exciting to read each chapter & see how it's all going to unfold. It's also tremendously inspiring and should be compulsory to read for all rowers. That said, the only reason I marked the book as 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think a familiarity with rowing would help the reader."
1,No stars for this product,The notebook in this product is very cheap. It takes several minutes to get the zipper started. It is worth about $0.01. I put one star because there was not the option of no stars.
5,Instrumental smash-out of the century!,"Cool it Daddy-o! This groovin' piece of wax is freakin' me out, man! Hot exotic rythms and wailing axes blow your speakers to hell and back! I mean, these cats are IT, man! Rumour on the street says that a new album might be coming out soon, can't wait to get it! Dig!"
4,more than you would expect,"More than just another modern day surf music band, The Fifty Foot Combo runs the gamut from surf to lounge to monster movie music sounds. A great CD here, with only a couple of weak songs."
4,kinda cool actually,"it has really old 3d grahpics, cheesy 2d graphics and controls that you would find on a begginer gamemaker game, but still i like this game alot. its a shoot-em-up game with no plot. you can get some powerups that are kinda hard to get and you can build your own ships. so it sounds kinda bad, buts it' not. (I also got this game for a buck. xD)"
5,Attractive and fun,"This salad set adds character to the kitchen! The dark stained wood is attractive, and it is as much a decoration as something we use on special occasions. If you don't have a great deal of space on your table, this is also a charming way to enhance your table setting without getting in the way of other dishes. The bowl is not attached to the 3-legged platform, so you can always separate it if needed, though don't put it near anyone's elbows or you'll have a bit of a mess. . While it's not best to use the dishwasher, it takes little time to clean. Comes boxed with legs disassembled: each of the long legs comes in two pieces and they screw together easily. These attach to the base. Easy setup, great look!"
5,Christmas present,"Purchase this item for my grandson and his girlfriend, they just love it and they use it alot,I have one and I think its the greatis salad bowl ever. Thank you."
5,Caesar Salad Set,"This is a really beautiful salad set. I do not use the stand (as yet). The bowl is very large, exactly what I needed. The price is excellent. Well below what I would have paid for another bowl of it's kind elsewhere."
2,not happy,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS TAPE BECAUSE AS IT TURNED OUT I DID NOT KNOW ANY OF THE SONGS, SO I FEEL LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY"
2,de Mallac's Gandhi,"Gandhi was a very complicated and brilliant man and an important teacher for the world today. De Mallac's little book is useful as a starting point in becoming acquainted with the Mahatma, but it suffers from being somewhat too short and from attempting to update Gandhi's approach to social change for the world of the 1990s. I am using this book in a class and I'm reading another short book about Gandhi on Kindle,Gandhi: A Very Short IntroductionThis second book strikes a better balance between brevity and presentation of a complex life than does de Mallac's."
5,Recommendation from College Woman,This book was recommended to me in my Women's Health course at my undergraduate university. I picked it up and couldn't put it down! It has made my sex life much more healthy and enjoyable! My roomates and I have loved sitting around and talking about our sex lives and reading exerpts to each other. I am giving it to them for the holidays. I think it makes an excellent gift.
3,nails,Very good product very good investment for my prodject. Im very happy i found and bought this item. Good item for my project makes me proud to have found this
1,"Bostitch SB16-2.00-1M 2-Inch by 16 Gauge Bright Finish Nail (1,000 per Box)",one star is for the product when i received this nail is all broken include packing .they ship with envelope. I can't believe.
1,Not the same nail!,"I have used several brands of finish nails, I am a professional builder. I bought a new bostich trim nail gun. It is the greatest gun I have ever owned. It is however finicky on using only Bostich brand nails, which is fine. The Bostich nails I purchased here continuously jammed, as do the generic nails. I am a huge Amazon fan, a customer now for years. I will continue to be an Amazon customer, but this product was not to the standard I am used to for nails. Also, they came packaged in a parcel and were scattered out of the box. I very much am convinced this is not the same product I have been using from Bostitch."
4,Gift Set is a Hit,"My wife really liked this gift basket, much to my surprise. I have given her so many of these, that I expected another ho-hum response.She especially mentioned the beautiful basket, which she put in the corner of the bathroom vanity."
3,Cover is Totally Misleading,"Cautionary Book Review: Misleading CoverOfficial ""Ro"" Reasoning:I thought the heroines in Indigo Love Spectrum books were supposed to be black. The cover shows an interracial couple bw/wm, but the book is about a white woman and a black man. If a person doesn't read carefully, then they would have ended up buying something that they were not expecting. That is not cool.Redo the cover, it's horrible to blatantly mislead people.Official ""Ro"" Rating: N/A (Cautionary Book Review)"
5,Chyeah,"Ok so the person from ARC bookclub or whatever. My guess is that you're book-retarded because quite honestly, how can the characters be shallow when many satisfied customers, myself included, found a depth in the character that really allowed us to experience what the character was experiencing. Plus, how could you figure out how they would handle situations and how the story would end if they are so allegedly shallow?This book has all the aspects of every good novel compiled into one: comedy, romance, mystery, murder, mystery, etc.It's a book that will really keep you on the edge of your seats with its constantly moving plot and laughing with the character's witty remarks.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been through a tragedy so they know how to stay strong, to anyone who has ever been in love, to anyone who has a crazy family, to any teacher, and to anyone who's just trying to find that place where they belong. This is an excellent book."
2,In For a Penny,"I didn't enjoy this book, more romance novel than mystery. The characters incessant description of every stitch of wardrobe and morsel of food is pretty useless but then I'm used to reading Michael Connelly and Robert Crais so maybe I expected to much. I won't read anymore of Ms. Wall's work."
5,I could have put it down but I didn't want to...,In for a Penny was a good solid read with well-drawn characters that had believable relationships between them. I look forward to the next book in the series.
5,In For A Penny,"The package had arrived by the time I got home from work on Friday. I tore into the package and then tore into the book. Didn't stop until I finished on Saturday! The book may be called ""In for a penny"", but you will be ""In"" for a great read!"
4,Bay Tanner,I really liked this book. The pages turned faster and faster as the book went on and Wall did an incredible job of creating the perfect low-country atmosphere. This is the first in her Bay Tanner series and I plan on reading every one.
5,Un CD Excelente!,"Tiene chispa, alegría y se logró adaptar la forma de interpretación de Lorenzo Antonio sin perder el estilo de Juan Gabriel. Esta mezcla de estilos e interpretaciones hizo que Lorenzo Antonio ganara Disco De Oro!"
5,Dreams of power,"As the main bouts of the Demon World tournament get underway, some of the best and most familiar fighters are removed rather quickly. While it looks like some of the fighters' motivations for entering aren't exactly what they seemed, they all have their eyes on one warrior as the prize--Yusuke.Kurama faces down Shigure in the ring! But Kurama has to deal with the demons of his past-namely his choice to remain in the Human World. With the boiling up of tempers and anxieties comes the resurgence of Yoko Kurama! But will Kurama find a way to keep his anger from taking over?High school student Kazuma Kuwabara is having a typical day. He is studying hard for his college entrance exams and fending off the flirtatious glances from his female admirers. But nothing could prepare him for what happens when he arrives at a mysterious meeting with Genkai. Surprise follows surprise as one by one each member of the old gang shows up! But where is Yusuke?"
5,A CLASSIC GODZILLA FAVORITE,"I love that these old monster flicks are being produced on good, quality DVDs. CLASSIC MEDIA has done a wonderful job!"
2,Invasion of Astro-Monster,"Not bad for the mid 1960's, but comes off poorly against Toho's more recent productions."
3,Invasion of Monster Zero,"Fun and campy classic involving King Ghidorah, Godzilla, and Rodan. The only time I've ever seen Godzilla do a jig. Movie was a birthday gift for a Godzilla fan. He loved it. Ordering was easy and I received it very quickly. Recommended for any fan of monster movies."
5,"Thanks, ClassicMedia","Excellent job for releasing this video with both Japanese and English languages, and for the audio commentary. Now we just need a couple of other Godzilla films to be released like this. Fast shipping from Amazon, also."
4,rubber suit classic,"This movie, being the ""Sequel"" to Ghidora, the three headed monster, surpasses that movie in both action shots and story. for those into classic Godzilla movies, this is a must have."
3,Invasion of Astro-Monster (aka Monster Zero) Toho Masters Series,"Invasion of Astro-Monster (aka Monster Zero) Toho Masters Series is another fine entry in the series. The quality is top notch, and Godzilla fans will definitely be happy with it."
1,CAUTION - Old Product,Buyer beware. This is an old 2007 product. It does not work with all bikes. It only works with bikes that have quick-release wheels. You will need to purchase an additional $20 part to work with other bikes.
4,superbook,This dvd is an ideal tool for teaching children about christian values.The content is easy to understand and in animation it will keep their minds focused.
5,Kids love the bible brought to life,"I'm really glad they decided to release these television episodes on DVD, I only wish they'd start to release the rest of the episodes and make a complete series. My kids love watching them! While they are no replacement for an actual bible and a family worship time, they are great for families that are looking for decent television shows that avoid the godless shows you see on TV today.Only complaint, there is no babysitter ""play all"" on the main screen, so someone is going to have to start each individual episode."
1,Hated It,Ordered But wish I didn't. Ordered because of the recommendation it was used for . was horrible I only wanted comedy Got misery
1,This Book should be out of Print!!,"This book bored me to tears. If that's everything I should know, I might as well be dead."
2,No Fresh Mouth Feel but Nice Flavor,"This toothpaste is a bit too sweet even though the flavor is delicious. The gel is a good consistency straight from the container, but once it meets the water, the toothpaste separates into little balls. The foaming action is nearly non-existent, so some of the balls remain intact. This paste tastes nice, but it does not leave your teeth nor tongue feeling fresh and clean. It may work alright for a toddler but not an adult."
4,Non-Phixion's Back,"Although I don't think the Green CD is quite as good as The Future Is Now, this cd is still a good production. There is smooth lyrics by Ill Bill, Goretex, and Sabac Red, and Dj Eclipse does good too. There is guest apperances, from Necro Ill Bill's brother, Necro is on radio freestyle with the Non-Phixion crew, there is also a guest appearance by Uncle Howie. The cd is also good because it comes with a dvd which shows them live and how they got started. If you are into labels like Phsyhco Logical and rhymesayers you would like this album."
3,pretty tight cd,"I'll be honest, Non Phixion isn't as ill as I expected them to be with rappers such as Ill Bill and Sabac Red. Goretex is garbadge. Beyond that though, there are some pretty ill freestyles on this cd. one big problem for me though is the beat jacking. I'll put on a track sometimes and be like ""hm where have I heard that beat before?"".Overall I would say this album is medicore, it has its strong points and it has its weak points. The ""gangsta"" subject matter though has become quite boring coming from this group. I say these kats just stay solo because albums like A Change Gon Come, Whats Wrong With Ill Bill, are classic material but these styles just don't work combined."
2,No future is now,I was excited when i found out there was a new non phixion cd and the fact it came with a dvd made me want to pick it up even more. I listened to the whole cd right after i purchased it and was very dissapointed. The beats are boring and the rhymes are no where near as good as The Future is Now. The dvd might be the only high point of the purchase. I was excited to hear some of necros new beats but they didnt sound like the same necro beats ive heard in the past. Maybe their next cd will give the future is now some competition.
3,Only three stars because I'm biased for Non Phixion,"If I didn't feel that way it would be one or two stars. The only good song on this c.d. is ""Existence"". After The Future is Now, I was expecting so many levels above this c.d. and was fully disappointed after buying it. The DVD is not too great either, though maybe would bump a one-star rating to a two."
1,2 YEARS FOR GARBAGE?,"THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! Its been two years and they release garbage tracks and radio freestyles. GIMME ME MONEY WORTH,damn. Only good thing is the DVD. Its okay.Damn this is a step down from THE FUTURE IS NOW"
4,this was nice..,"it took me a while to get into this album, but there are a few EXCELLENT songs on here..especially the hidden track by ill bill. all the freestyles were tight, and lots of songs were socially deep and confronted issues of police brutality and american imperialism.i cant wait till their 2nd full album drops in fall 2004"
4,Green,"The Green CD has some really tight rhyming by Non Phixion, but I have a feeling that some people who like The Future is Now won't feel the production; it's not horrible, in fact, there are some real tight beats, but it isn't up to the caliber of The Future is Now. In particular, the beat on We All Bleed is excellent (thus far probably my favorite track on the album).Any shortcomings can easily be forgiven though, because the accompanying Green DVD more than makes up for it. It has 2 hours of interviews, videos, and live performances. The three music videos are all hot: Rock Stars, 14 Years of Rap (it's a psuedo battle with the Arsonists), and Suicide Bomb. The concert performance of Black Helicopters is amazing. The interviews of Ill Bill, Sabac, Goretex, DJ Eclipse, and Uncle Howie are interesting and (in many cases) very funny. I wish they had spent some more time interviewing Necro (he only appears briefly).This album is definitely worth picking up for the DVD alone."
4,Smaller than I thought,I may have read the description wrong but these pages didn't actually fit in my planner so it was kind of a let down. Otherwise it was shipped very quickly and in great condition like promised.
4,Day-Timer,A very good product but expensive. Could buy new product of another brand cheaper then refills that I got from Day-Timer.
5,Just write,"Just what I need, without the rest of the fluff. I love getting fast courtest service. Just what I need, to my door, in the comfort of my home, to my home, to update what got outdated. Just in time for the holidays."
4,Day-Timer Address and Phone refill,"This product was shipped to me very quickly. I like address and phone pages that are sectioned off, but I suppose I can ink in my own lines to divide the entries. I use this as a back up, in case I lose information in my cell phone. The sections have nice colored labels, which are easy to use. I also had to pay for shipping, which was pretty high, considering this a reasonably priced item."
4,Steal Away (I want to go back to Maui),"I'm listening to ""Steal Away"" right now on Radio@AOL - could have knocked me over with surprise and pleasure, because we heard Dennis Kamakahi sing this very catchy tune and others in a solo acoustic gig at the Maui Ritz-Carlton on Tuesday, February 8 (one of the ""Masters of Hawaiian Slack-Key Guitar"" evenings.It was a great evening, enlivened by hula and a wonderful feeling of ""ohana.""I recognized Dennis' voice and the song immediately - think I'll be buying this CD very soon."
3,Sounds,"This doesn't sound like the backstreet boys. It is more in the line of country music, similar to Vince Gill."
2,disappointed,"Was excited to see this book and was impressed with many of the designs. However, when I actually started a project that I really wanted to make, I found serious errors in the instructions. The instructions had an incorrect number of base chain stitches, incorrect stitches cited in the pattern, and a special stitch that was not referenced in the instruction but was crucial to the pattern. I have not tried the other patterns but was forced to rewrite the instructions to complete this one. I can only hope the others were better edited."
3,Nice Book,"Nice book, but there is really only one pattern in the book that resembles the pattern on the cover. Was hoping for more similar items. Most of the patterns are actually by other people, not Donna Kooler."
2,Pointless comedy/drama,"Amiable but rather pointless film about a somewhat estranged brother and sister discovering their Polish heritage during an impromptu trip from Switzerland to Poland. This movie can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a gay comedy, a family drama or a road movie, and so doesn't succeed in being any of these. This is obviously a labor of love on the part of writer/director/actor Lionel Baier who stars as the brother (who also happens to be named Lionel Baier), but it fails to engender much in the way of interest for the audience.Good performances by Baier and Natacha Koutchoumov as the sister, but not much else to recommend it."
2,An odd hybrid,"I decided to watch ""Stealth"" after I had read those two very positive reviews posted on Amazon. And? Yet again I had this feeling that I must have been watching another film than those two men.Even if the main plot is quite interesting, I got bored and tired after first 30 minutes. The director seems to be wishy-washy about the way his film should be like. I am not sure if this is a gay-theme comedy or a drama or a thriller (yep, thanks to the music in some scenes). Btw, once you introduce music in a scene, it should help to build up the atmosphere, to enhance it. In this case we have for example a scene where main character talks to his father (about nothing horrific, plain chit-chat), but the music in the backround could have served well in every thiller.In my opinion is one of the movies that you forget about while watching it. Not totally bad, but not good either."
2,Leather on bag is nice... rivets/strap NOT,"I wanted to help potential customers so I'm taking the time to write a review.The leather on the actual bag is very nice. It's a soft buttery calfskin but I'm a little thrown off by how blindingly shiny it is. It's not a matte look like in the photos.The strap is awful... the shoulder pad on the strap is a small piece of tough leather which hurts your shoulders. The strap band itself is very thin and has a cheap feeling to it.The metal rivets holding the handles together are of cheap hardware.All in all, you're paying for the body of the bag. The stainless steel hardware is cheap so I don't expect it to last very long (though they say it's covered by a life-time warranty). The stitching is pretty good. The strap is what makes this a $200+ bag rather than a $300+. If you're already spending close to $300 I'd advise looking at a Jack Spade."
4,"Love this beautiful bag, gift for husband.",Really nice quality leather with plenty of room to use for overnight travel. A little on the shiny side but with use it looks like it will wear beautifully. My husband was quite pleased with this Christmas gift. Would buy this brand again.
3,GOOD LUCK CLOSING THE KNIFE,"I received exactly what I did NOT want-- the NEW version of the Cold Steel Recon 1 Clip Point. The old version is fantatstic, and opens and closes with ease. However , the new version is terribly difficult to close. I had to go to You Tube to understand how to close the blade. The knife itselfis a great knife, beautiful and comfortable to hold. However, the closing is extremely frustrating and a bit dangerous for me. Be careful.The display photo is misleading and should be changed.."
4,Cold Steel's the best for the price and workmanship,"I have the newer gen recon knife, but I wanted this first gen because of it's faster to flip open. As Cold Steel quality goes, don't leave home without it. I prefer the half serrated because the serrated part will easily cut thru you enemies jacket"
1,"Terrible Sound, Terrible Comfort, Terrible Product","You'd be better off sticking a pair of cut up pieces of straw in your ears. The head piece is entirely too small, unless you've been stricken by a band of tropical head hunters. The sound emanating from the earphones is more like what one would find in the bottom of a cave, and optional silicone ear plugs made me want to go visit jack kevorkian to end the excruciating pain. These sorry things don't even deserve a single star. Donate your $34 to a worthy cause, go splurge and treat yourself to sort of decent meal, or help the poor American auto industry put $34 down on a car!"
1,"Be great if they worked,....","I really wanted these to work....expensive iPOD swim belt,....Otterbox for the ipod Shuffle,..expensive little earphones.....the system would work, but the things just don't stay in my ears. I get 1/2 a lap of good (enough) sound in one ear, and then the water comes in and it is all over.I found the swim belt comfortable enough to swim with and the otter box worked fine,..this is the only weak link.I am stupid enough to be tempted by the newer versions,..or maybe I will monkey with these..."
2,Sporadic results,"When these work they are really great. They sound tinny above water, but really great underwater. But, they leak on me a lot, and I cannot figure out why. Some days I can swim for 30 minutes with few problems, other times I cannot keep the water out. The problem is that if water gets in, you cannot hear anything at all. You have to stop swimming, take the out of your ears and shake out the water, then put them back in. Over all I find them very frustrating. Another guy at my pool has a pair and loves them, but I have really given up on them."
2,not very comfortabel while swimming,It is not very comfortabel while swimming. I do not like the headband anyway and it was not working/fitting. Without the headband it is working but I have to correct the fitting to the ears very often and it is not closing off the ear from water. With water getting in and out of the ear the sound/volume change significant.
2,They work! But...,"I bought these for experimental use in a flotation tank. They work, but are very light duty. If you are looking for something to use every day for workouts etc., I would recommend looking for a sturdier unit. If you just want to try the ""sound-under-water"" experience or need something for occasional use, these are acceptable."
3,They do work.,"Okay, so after reading everyone's complaints and ordering these anyway, I went to the pool today and figured them out. My first try wasn't very successful, but after a bit of tinkering I figured out that you don't put them far into your ears at all...just inside and don't have the holes on the ends of the pieces pushed up against any of the inside of your ear. Let them just sit inside at the opening of your ear canal. Above water they are a bit tinny and thin. Below water the base comes out and the sound gains depth. I think they're definitely worth the $27 or so $$ to have sound where you otherwise couldn't. I'm sure this design can be improved on at some point, but for now, it's a workable option. And they do stay on just fine. I put them on and then my swim cap on top of them. I wear my ipod on my arm and I'm a small person so I don't have any issue with the length of the coiled wire. I like it compact...no tangling."
1,Garbage at its worst!,I am just going to take a guess that most people who order the h2o headphones are VERY dissapointed-hence the No return policy. This is my 4th pair of waterpfoof headphones they all are garbage!!!!!! Maybe my trashcan will enjoy them more than me.
1,"well designed, poorly executed - stopped working after 5 days","After using this product one hour a day for five days, it no longer works. It appears that the jack is very flimsy, and that ANY stress on the cord attaching the headphones to the jack (such as wearing the headphones!) will immediately dislodge the wire from the jack and rending the headphones useless.It's a shame- I was SO excited to find a set of headphones that stayed put while I swam laps, and was comfortable. But the fact they died so quickly (I normally get at least a month out of the cheapy ones) just irritates me. I'd wait a while for the company to perfect these, because clearly the first ones produced have some major issues."
1,please heed these reviews and don't support this product,"I was extremely excited by the marketing of these waterproof headphones. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The first pair was muffled and then broke within a week. They sent me another pair, but still, after hours of fiddling, cutting, buying wax, buying a swim cap, the sound was muffled and very poor quality. Clearly they don't even think their product works as demonstrated by the exceptionally restrictive return policy. Purchase this product at your own risk."
1,Don't buy this item,"I purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle. They are were very uncomfortable from the start, but I could listen to music. That didn't last long. The connection would not hold and if I didn't hold it together, the music faded out. Also, music faded in and out from ear to ear. I finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less."
1,Totally useless...,"I'm often skeptical of Amazon reviews, so I went ahead and gambled $25. Losing bet. These things are completely worthless.I can't imagine whose head these might fit, or whose ear canals. The head band is tight enough for a small child and not adjustable, so WAY too tight for an adult head. The ear plugs, on the other hand, are enormous, and would require huge, gaping ear canals to fit properly.The sound... well, don't worry about how bad the sound is, because the discomfort of trying to wear these makes it unlikely that you'll have to put up with the dreadful sound quality for long.Just don't buy these headphones. Please."
4,HPI essentials review,"The text is good as an overview, and provides specifics regarding HPI, but it does not go enough in depth. It is a good resource for bullet points of things that should be done and why."
5,Great Bang For The Buck!,"I have been looking for a quality laptop bag that would hold everything I wanted from pens to my files to my actual laptop. This one does it all and more, has room for all my accessories, all my pens and zip drives, has a shoulder strap and more. It appears to be holding up extremely well and looks to be made of quality materials. Cannot beat the price!"
2,Misleading Title!!,"Obviously, it is the selection and not the poetry itself which merits the low rating. I ordered this text after consulting Books in Print; ""Selected Poems"" seems reasonable enough. In fact, the poems cover only the first half of Yeats's career, and thus many of his finest works are not represented. Caveat emptor!"
3,Why not more of the great Yeats Poems,"Where is Leda and the Swan, Sailing to Byzantium, etc. Early Yeats is OK but somewhat Victorian and self consciously ""poetic"" in tone. ""The Sad Shepard""?"
5,Two Great L'Amour Stories,"""South of Deadwood"" is a little confusing at first--it seems disjointed as it previews the story to come. Then Louis L'Amour narrates historical facts about Deadwood and some of the earlier gunmen. Next the story begins...when Bowdrie comes to Deadwood to escort Curly Starr, horse thief and bank robber, to Texas to stand trial for his crimes.""Too Tough to Brand"" is another Bowdrie story. Texas Ranger Bowdrie is called in to investigate the missing 0-Bar-O ranch foremen, Ramey, and $15,000.Both are well worth listening to."
4,Good but short,Its an interesting interview. Shania talks about Mutt and her life. Its an old interview and is about 20 minutes long. It is a must have for any die-hard Shania fans.
3,Difficult install,The Visioneer 8600 proved difficult to install. I had The Visioneer 5300 and liked it very much but after installing the 8600 I wished I had tried the Epson 1200. First the system crashed and I rebooted everything seemed fine until I installed the MGI Photo Suite. It cause my program Second chance to crash and refuse to enter after rebooting. After I took of MGI Photo Suite it worked just fine. I am now downloading updates for both the 8600 driver and MGI Photo suite. I hope it corrects the problem. After scanning my first image I didn't notice any difference in scan quality over my 5300 Visioneer. However the 8600 was much faster probably 3 times as fast. Now if I can just get the rest of the software to work I can tell you how it all runs as a unit.
1,8600 is a defective design,I have had 2 8600 scanners fail with the same problem. The scanner will stop scanning because it detects the lock is locked eventhough the lock is disabled. Visioneer replaced my first scanner and the replacement failed 9 months later with the same issue. They then would not back up their product.I recommend buying elsewhere.
5,Excellent Scanner and a great buy,I love this scanner! This is my first scanner and I am very happy with it. It installed with no problem and scans are a snap. Fast and easy. I havent had any problems with it at all and would highly recommend it to others. Its a great product.
3,gray scale,I have had my scanner for over three years and it really saves me a lot of time. But I do wish that their was a customer service line to help with problems that are not available.I have tried everything to make my faxes come out in black and white but to no avail.The background is always gray. Even when I just print to copy.Are their manuals that I can purchase?
2,Makes more noise than my desktop fan,Don't know if it's the model I got but this unit gets hot and makes a lot of noise with the little fan in it. I'm on my 3rd adapter for my Toshiba. I don't even use the machine anymore since these adapters are adding up.
4,One step closer to being organized,"Just what I was looking for, slots are wide enough to handle standard sized clip boards."
3,Should have more Windows programming...,"This is a very good book for writing programs for DOS, but there isn't a mention of Windows programming. If you want to learn the inside outs of the Object Pascal language this is a good book. Also there isn't much about Object-Oriented programming here either. Overall an OK book for people moving over to Delphi from another language, and a very good book for new programmers..."
1,Another poor book by a poor author.,"To give this book even one star is being too generous. This is the second book from this author that I purchased. The first was ""The Tomes of Delphi Win32 Database Developer's Guide"" it was bad and this one is even worse. I vow never to buy another book by this author. He seems to think that just mentioning a topic is adequate coverage. His sample code is incomplete and misleading and the Quick Check sections often present review questions that don't relate to the section just covered. This book is obviously written by an author who is not an expert in the topic he is writing about. Other books that cover this topic better are ""Mastering Delphi 5"", ""Delphi 5 Developer's Guide"", and ""Teach Yourself Delphi 4"". The publisher is doing us all a disservice by publishing this guy's books."
4,GREAT DOLL,"VERY WELL MADE, ERGONOMICALLY CORRECT, CAN TAKE IT IN THE BATH. BOTTLE IS A LITTLE HARD TO FILL TO FEED THE DOLL WATER AND ENABLE THE DOLL TO GO ""POTTY"". WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL IF THE DOLL HAD A ""SIPPY CUP"" INSTEAD OF A BOTTLE SINCE MANY CHILDREN HAVE MOVED ON TO THE SIPPY CUP AT THIS AGE. OVERALL RESEARCHED MANY POTTY DOLLS AND I AM HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE!"
2,Water pours out,"Doll is cute, but as soon as you put the water in the baby's mouth its on the floor. That is if you can get the water into the bottle."
2,Not what was expected,My granddaughter that I bought it for was not interested in this doll. I should have sent it back. Waste..
2,overpriced,This product is over priced in every way. The doll came with a squeeze bottle that is difficult to fill and the doll looks like somthing that one could purchase from the local five and dime. I was really disappointed.
3,"Okay, but not perfect","The doll is cute, and the potty is fine, but the bottle is very simple and hard to fill or use. My daughter (2 and a half) got very frustrated trying to ""feed"" her baby water, as it takes quite a bit of coordination.Overall, I wish the bottle were a better design and I would be very happy with the product."
3,OK... But not as amazing as some say,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this doll. But as for it enabling some potty epiphany - not so much. She did understand what the doll was doing, but it didn't translate to what she needed to do."
5,Powerful narrative,I was a bit skeptical at first with this book but once I started it I could not put it down. It has such a strong story and Emily's personal journey to maintain her own faith while of adopting that of her husband is truly mesmerizing. Beautiful story. Powerful Dialogue. A must read.
3,SRA Math Explorations,"The problems in the workbook are good. My biggest complaint is that there is no answer key. It's been a while since I was in fifth grade so when it comes to the more difficult problems, it would be nice to have the answers in order to check."
5,Sanskrit Text,"I purchased this book, ISBN 0-8356-7455-X and SBN 0-7229-7455-8 thinking it was an English translation and it turns out that the book has an introduction in English and the rest of the text is entirely in Sanskrit. Amazon will not change listing status, so as to avoid confusion, I have posted this review. The entire book title is Amarakosa [1] With the Unpublished South Indian CommentariesAmarapadavivrti of Lingayasurin and the Amarapadaparijata of Mallinatha, Critically edited with Introduction by Professor A.A. Ramanathan."
5,Eternally briliant Eno in superb and lively musical environment,"A new Brian Eno video or CD is always worthy of one's time and investment... As for this one, this gathering of superb Mid Eastern artists makes for some genuinely amazing improvizations! An underrated gem. Get this!"
5,Sassy sings intimately,"Well, it's official now.Sarah Vaughan is and always will be one of the greatest jazz singers... Since all comments basically agree on that, I just wanted to add my own little voice in the choir of adoration.The intimate nature of this album makes it close to cool jazz, but Sassy is to emotional for that (even at this album she leans towards the pathos)... The setting is great, the mood is right, the voice is lush the instruments subtle and the vibrato impressive but not too agressive..."
5,fantastic cook book,This is one of the best cook books we have in our library. The cook book is filled with traditional delicious recipes. We highly recommend it.
2,BSOD - not enough product info,The technical specifications are lacking the voltage of the memory and as such cause my computer to go to the blue screen of death because these chips are 2.3v while my others are 2.1v - Amazon please add the voltage to these memory chip specs.Since these are the wrong voltage for my computer I rated it at 2 stars. I wouldnt have purchassed these if the voltage had been written somewhere on the product page. I would have rated 5 star if the voltage was written down on here so I could have known if they were the correct ones or not.
3,not really 1066MHz,"I bought this to pair with my old Corsair 1066MHz (both pairs sharing similar specs). After installation the BIOS (Gigabyte ep45-ud3p) decreased memory frequency to 800MHz by default (even with Corsair only, showed always 1066MHz by default). Next, I conditioned from BIOS the memory to work at 1066MHz and restarted the computer. After 2-3 min sensors read 85-90 Celsius degrees for CPU temperature. I opened the case and I felt the overheating of the memory and CPU. I removed Kingston pair and everything got back normal.If you let the memory working @800MHz seems everything is working normal, no overheating.Unfortunately I had to return Kingston pair back."
1,Runs at 800 mhz not the advertised speeds.,"As other reviewers have mentioned:These sticks refuse to run at their advertised speed of 1066.This ram was supposed to speed up my system instead it created a bottleneck. now my cpu is running at 800.... guess what kingst0n, when you make ""performance"" memory you better have it deliver.What a shame Kingst0n... I won't even buy you for the office anymore.I have never been ""jipped"" like this and I have been building computers for a very long time.I will be throwing these ""toys"" out soon and getting some real ram.Should've stuck with C0rsair. Maybe some patri0t. but never again with this brand.Do yourself a favor and avoid these."
2,did not work on mobo gigabyte or asrock,memory did not work on mobo gigabyte or asrock would not run at 1066 stable dual or single sent it back
5,HyperX-ceptional!,"Excellent, fast, stable memory module. BIOS must be set manually to acheive 1066MHz running 5-5-5-15 @ 2.2V+. No problems so far. No heat issues. Installed an 80mm cooling fan over the memory and NB heatsink just for added measure. My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-MA770-UD3 AM2+. I initally installed the Corsair Dominator PC-8500 1066MHz 4GB EPP Dual Channel which continued to dump and BSOD. I thought the Corsair may have been defective so I returned it to Corsair for a replacement, to no avail, same results. After installing the Kingston, my computer has been very stable with the Vista Ultimate OS 64 bit. I don't think the Corsair was compatible with the Gigabyte mobo. Quality Vendor list depicted the Corsair memory but not the Dominator. I have used Kingston over the years and was always satisfied. Kingston will be my first option for all of my future upgrade needs."
5,Great,"great quality and just as i wanted them, recomended this product to anyone that still has DDR2 based motherboards! NM"
4,Not quite as advertised,"As others have commented, this memory runs at 5-5-5-18 and 800mhz at 1.8v by default. You must enter your PC's bios and turn up the memory voltage in order to achieve the maximum speed. This results in the memory running hotter, possibly shortening the lifespan, and introducing an element of instability to the system. Despite the nice cooling fins I chose to leave the memory settings on auto and accept the default settings. That said, the memory was a definite upgrade to my previous ram. It installed and ran perfectly right from the start and there is a modest but noticeable improvement in my PC's performance. I am happy with the results."
3,good for what it is,"nice blade, quality handle, razor sharp. This is a pretty cool knife. Its very small though so know what youre buying"
4,"Great item, but seller lied about where it was made.","Blade is great. High quality, like all Ka-Bar items I've ever used. But beware, it said on the item description it was stamped ""Olean, NY"" like all made in USA blades. In reality it's made in Taiwan. If you want USA made, skip this item."
1,not very good,This knife appears larger on the photo. it looks like it was made very cheeply. made in Tiawan. that tells the story! for a KA-Bar item: very disappointed!
2,To Small,"I own an old Ka-Bar Knife nice piece of steel fits well in the hand this one has a much smaller handle and blade. I'll pass it on to my son(12), I think he'll enjoy it but it's to small for my hand."
3,Satisfied,Not an exceptional knife but a good standard hunting knife. I was disappointed that it was not made in the US as my other ka-bar is but it's still a good quality ka-bar. The stacked leather handle makes the knife look like it was made a couple of generations ago - not cheap plastic. I wish it was a bit wider blade and a bit longer but it is functional.
5,Best Spanish Rock CD I've heard,I loved this CD from beginning to end. La Ley rocks literaly and figuratively speaking.
5,The best of La Ley,"This Cd is their best and would always be their best. The songs in this Cd are what La Ley is made of. Their best song in this Cd is El Duelo (of course). Animal, Dia cero, Invisible, Cielo Market, El Rey are also great. It will be tough for La Ley to make a Cd better than this one because they have not done it yet."
4,Medium size organizer,This size organizer is not for everybody but I like it because it fits into the cubby in my door in the car and it fits nicely into most handbags. I love the brown and it is great to the touch. The daytimer refill pages are to expensive so I buy generic. I would love to use the Day-Timer Brand. Roomy inside. I really like this and I shopped around alot to find the right size and color and feel. Enjoy
3,seems interesting...,"This is a book I' d like to read and review, perhaps in a review article including other economic books on Cuban affairs that I have listed. These include some by Perez-Lopez and a forthcoming reedition of Guerilla Prince, which I hope to receive either in a readable format by e-mail or as a courtesy of the eds.Prof (econ) Claes Croner EcoLingua 11727 Stockholm Sweden"
2,Don't buy this book if you want to learn how to make the best scented candles around.,"I purchased this book thinking that, with it's help, I would be able to make my own awesome scented candles - the ones like the new scented oil candles from Glade. Given the right amount of information about making scented candles, I would be able to deduce how to make something at least similar to these. Unfortunately, this book was more of a primer to candle making than an encyclopedia, as I expected from it's title. This book provides little more information than you could get with a beginning candle making kit. Don't buy this book if you want to make highly scented (""triple scented"") candles. Instead, check out http://www.crazyforcandles.com/comparison.html for information on buying these types of candles from other manufacturers."
4,This is the title of my review,"This gun's pretty darn good. Mine broke the first day I got it, but two of my friends got one the same day and had no problems. It was the spring in magazine; it collapsed in on itself. The store exchanged it for a new one, but I'm worried it may do it again....maybe I'm just unlucky; my two friends haven't had any problems, so from and objective point of view, I would definitely recommend this gun. (the fast reloading resivoir magazine thingy is awesome)"
3,"Nice, but a little dissappointing for the price",The design on these is nice. However they do not look like $70 earrings. For something so expensive I would expect them to be slightly heavier and of a more rich grade of silver. They were almost too shiny which made them look a little cheap. They did look nice on---just not worth the high price tag.
5,Very Different and Very Wonderful,"The tone and delivery of this book is very different for the author, but I really like it. There's a debth here, and a ""feeling"" beneath the words that says this book was guided and inspired from something very real to the writer. This makes reading much more interesting and inspiring too! The activities, philosophy, and presentation is all very practical considering modern life, and very earth-responsible. Possibly Telesco's best book ever."
1,useless,This thing is a piece of junk. admittedly I bought it at TJ Maxx which might have been a mistake but I haven't had a problem with stuff there before. I can't get any of the brackets to fit right for my G4 iPod touch. I tried to rig something but that availed no results. If the iPod is sitting a millimeter tipped in the wrong direction it doesn't play. I had it playing the first night after much effort but the alarm didn't go off the next morning. It seemed to try but all it did was make this funny staticy noise like when electrical current is leaking. I think with continued use it will probably destroy the iPod. And I can't get hold of customer service at all. I think i shall attempt to return it. So sad because it looked really neat. Maybe it would work well with an old iPod model.
2,Defective,"This didn't work well. You can play your IPod (sometimes) but it will not charge it. I called the seller and they were very good about me returning the item. I didn't get my return shipping paid and I haven't received my credit yet, though I should in a few days, hopefully. I would not buy this item. Its too bad because I wanted a small I Pod dock with a clock radio."
1,This product will not fit an Ipod touch,This product will not fit an Ipod touch. Too tight to fit the Ipod touch. Maybe for a smaller ipod.
3,pretty good,This docking station arrived quickly and played the music loud enough to wake me and I am hard of hearing. The biggest con with this system is it was a little tricky to set up after I've gotten used to my other alarm clock (yes I need 2 because I have a hard time hearing) which sets itself.
2,Fin De Un Mundo Enfermo,"This album is not there best. This band is a great band, but their member expect the singer Andres Gimenez are greater. Music are not sinconic, you only hear a revolu, so I don't give more than 2 star to this album. Sorry guy, but It true. Better song's are: Fin de un mundo enfermo, Solo por ser Indios... that's it."
4,A.N.I.M.A.L,"When i first saw A.N.I.M.A.L., I thought that they were going to be punk, but i found out that they are a very cool rock/heavy metal band. They were the only metal band at Warped Tour, and they fuly deserved to be there, watch out for this cool cd. This cd will rock your world, you wont be expecting it, and al of a sudden, you get blasted with great rock music. I suggest if you are a real fan of rock, that you buy this album."
1,"amateurish, as author put it: I had to reach deep for this one","As the author put it: ""I had to reach deep for this one"". In reality, over his head. The reviews that rate this high are to me questionable. This book went right to the trash can. ""Amateurish"" is the best description."
3,Round up for a review.,"A classical must for the collector. The recording is done well, sonic quality is there with a surround type of mix it comes across quite nicely."
5,An audiophile great!,"This CD offers superb performances and stunning sound with which to demonstrate audio equipment. There is no doubt that the two Copland scores are the finer music and will stand repeated listening. However Grofe's famous suite is highly enjoyable when performed and recorded with this care, and anyone looking for any of these three works should not be disappointed. I am refering to the basic CD layer which is all that I have heard. The SACD and three channel versions also on the disc should enhance the listening experience even further."
4,Good but could be better,This gun is great for begginers and it shoots fast and it has an ajustable sight. it is also very acurate and i still like it. The onley problem is it take ages to load bbs into the magazine and it is a spring-action it should be a semi-auto bolt blow-back but overall great gun
1,doesn't work for long time,is incredible the mixture of the 2 kind of light but not for long time just a few months
2,Bulb broke,"Nice aquarium light, but one of them only lasted a couple of weeks then went out. No warranty."
4,nice.,I like the light it puts off...makes my tank look pleasant. This is also just one bulb...not 2 bulbs like in the picture.
5,Works great!,Bought 2 for my 10 gallon. Works soooo much better for my plants. Looks very good compared to stock bulbs. Recommended for small shallow 10 gallon setups.
4,Best fitting shoe I've ever had.,With the 5E width I was able to go down a full shoe size. If they come out with a 6E I could go down another 1/2 size. Wish I had these fifty years ago.
2,Too narrow,Feels way too narrow. Should know better than to buy shoes off the Internet. They run a size smaller than the size stated. I will read all reviews next time.
2,Not very comfortable,"I am not impressed with these shoes and rarely wear them. I like all these shoes (also purchased on Amazon) better: Adidas Superriot Nova running shoes, Hi-Tec Men's Multiterra II Low Hiking Shoes, Reebok Men's Ers 2000 Sneakers (probably like these the best), and the Adidas Men's Fast As Low M Fast and Light Hiking Shoe."
1,Returned Item,"I had to return this item, because it did not fit properly. I have a wide foot, but the EEEEE size is really wide. So if you need a wide shoe, I would recommend this Brand. It looked like a very nice product. Just did not fit."
5,Great shoe!,I needed a size 17 shoe for my son and couldn't find one locally. The stores offered to order one for well over $150! I found these online and was very pleasantly surprised! The sizing was accurate and the shoe well made!! Now I know where to get my son's shoes from now on!
5,Great Walking/Casual Shoe,Not a bad shoe. They compare to the Sketchers I have and the Profet were about $20 less. They are comfortable and look good.
3,Runs 1/2 size SHORTER than normal sizing,"Because the toe narrows, this style must be ordered 1/2 size larger. I ordered a 10D and when measured heel-to-toe against other shoes of the same size, the Propet did not match their length. A disappointment because it could not be exchanged for a size 10.5D and a refund was the only solution."
4,Seems to be a great shoe,"I say that because I ordered an 11B at a great price. It was a great looking shoe but was too small. I returned these and did not order larger size because the price was much, much more for a half size larger."
5,fit great,"My husband is 6'8"" and he loves these shoes. We have a hard time finding anything comfortable in his size that he likes. These seem to run true to size. They have plenty of room in the toe too. He has had these before and they seem to wear really well. Overall they are a quality product."
2,not a walking shoe,"I had high hopes for these shoes from the other reviews but when I got them I was disappointed. They fit nice and I have hard feet to fit. I wear a 10.5 5E, the shoes fit nice with out any stretching but my problem is with the padding or rather the lack of padding. You can remove the insole of the shoes and see what the problem is. The insole is just a piece of rubber with some cloth on it. Under the insole is just the sole of the shoe. There is no padding what so ever. I walk for 8 hours a day at work and these shoes were killing my feet after 2 hours. Putting extra insoles helps some but its not the same as having a new pair of shoes with proper insoles."
3,extra wide shoes,I bought these for my husband who has a very wide foot. I just wish they were a bit wider and I wish manufacturers would sell them in a 6E or 7E. We will most likely have to use a shoe stretcher on them. We are keeping them only because we have found nothing else that even comes close to fitting short of custom made shoes which we cannot afford. Very nice sneakers and well made for the price just wish they came wider.
2,"Comfortable fit, awkward gait","When I first got these I put my orthotics in and they felt very comfortable and sturdy. Yet when I walked in them the shoe falls flat and and slows my stride. My brother asked if there was something wrong with me because I was ""walking funny"". I put the original insets back in and it improved only slightly.These shoes might be just right for someone with a different gait, but I think I'm going to figure out how to shave some edges down to make my foot land more comfortably."
3,Nice looking shoe but....,Had to send them back because they were too small. I usually wear a 9 eee but these shoes were too narrow for me.
4,"Propet Men's M2034 Stability Walker Sneaker,Black,10 X (US Men's 10 EEE)","Propet Men's M2034 Stability Walker Sneaker,Black,10 X (US Men's 10 EEE) I like the shoes, so 4 stars. It looks good, but seems to be wearing kind of fast considering the low milege i've put on them. Good to superior fit in the 3E. Very comfortable. It is the first time I've tried out a 3E in any shoe. I bought a pair just to try them out, and at $26 It was a good price. Now I'd like to have a couple more pairs for different uses. Ya know, a pair to keep nice and a couple to do rougher things with. But, the price has gone up to $57. I don't think so, something seems wrong with a price change like that."
3,Not wide enough on the arch area,"I bought a size 8 5E, white.Here are my foot measures(without socks) and how it fits in the shoes when I wear it with cotton socks:- Length, heel to toe: 10 inches = Fits well.- Width of mounds area: 4.25 inches = Fits well.- Width of arch area: 3.75 inches = Doesn't fits well, the shoes is like 3.25 there.- Height of arch area: 3.0 inches = Fits well.PROS:The shoes are lightweight, appealing, very soft, overall comfortable. Good price."
5,The Crime Studio,"I'm not sure what I can say about this book -- it's weird and funny, with quotable lines on every page, and I wanted to read it again the second I finished it. In fact, I might just do that . . .This is a collection of interrelated stories about the citizens of Beerlight, where apparently everyone is a criminal -- although criminal aptitude varies, of course. There is a running theme of . . . I want to say joy . . . in these stories. As often as not, these burglars and con artists have become what they are due to an appreciation of the absurd, or a desire for hilarity -- I found the combination of mayhem and glee to be irresistible.Oddly enough, the writing reminds me very much of Catch-22, with surreal situations, wonderful wordplay, and the occasional shot to the heart.I would highly recommend this book."
4,monster mash,Used this CD for a 5th grade talent show; it was just what we needed for the Monster Mash. Arrived in a timely manner.
3,Install headache and OCR problems,"The quality of the scanned product is very good once you have the scanner correctly installed. Beware though if you already have a different Visioneer scanner and a number of other peripherals as installation becomes a nightmare. We had to install, re-install the product 3 times. The support could be better also. The installation guide that comes with the scanner doesn't give much information when you are having difficulty with the auto document feeder and file conversions. If you want your OCR documents to reflect your original document you will also need to upgrade to Paperport Deluxe (at additional cost to you), otherwise your documents have additional characters added and the editing process becomes far too lengthy. Basically this is a good scanner, but you need to be familiar with scanner capabilities or it can be a real headache."
1,PIECE OF [JUNK]!,the automatic document feeder on this piece of [junk] jams up every other time you use it!!! i am trying to scan documents in to email them to save money however i spend more time trying to clear jams and correctly scan the documents in that i wind up just faxing it. stay away from this one. i shouldn't have even gave it one star but i think i had to!!!
1,This Scanner is Junk,"I am on my second Onetouch 8650. I had to ship the first one back because no matter how careful I was with positioning and making sure that the proper paper was used, the ADF would jam up about every other page. I was then shipped a new one. It doesn't jam quite as often as the first, but the ADF is essentially useless unless you are just using copy paper. If you use any standard weight correspondence paper, it will jam the ADF. If I scan without using the ADF, there are all sorts of weird marks that show up on the scan that then need to be erased. This also occurred on the first machine which I shipped back. I used to use the Visioneer Strobe Pro, but that scanner won't work with Windows XP."
3,[...]? You've got to be kidding!,"Sure, this is a fine book for advanced karate students and instructors, but with 2 copies available on Amazon.com at [...], well, for that price it should come in a solid gold binding with the author personally available for individual consultation. As it is, it looks like it was printed in someone's garage. Besides, if that folk hero to the weak of mind, Rob Redmond likes it, I hate it. I can't think of a worse person to endorse anything!"
5,A true reference book for the serious karateist.,"At the time of this writing, I have had Dr. Schmeisser's book for about 8 months, and it becomes more valuable all the time. Both for my own understanding, and for use in planning and teaching karate to others, Advanced Karate-Do is in a class by itself. Every important karate principle is touched upon and explained. Students of martial arts other than Shotokan will still find much of value here. Any serious Shotokan practitioner who has not read this book is missing an extremely valuable resource."
5,A good book,"Normaly when we se books about karate almost all talk about how doing some moviment, but this book is more than this. The writer shows concepts behind de moviments and a deeper aprouch about karate-do. I recomend it."
2,Really loud.,"I bought this swing because my swing from my 1st son didn't work after being stored. I love the look of this swing. The pictures on it are really cute. I also like that it plugs in instead of using batteries. However, the swing squeaks so loud it is amazing that my son can fall asleep in it. If I had to do over again I would probably buy a different one. I am really disappointed."
3,Just alright,The swing and mobile are a bit noisy. Wish I would have sprung for the more snuggly models as the seat doesn't have much padding. All in all okay for the price
1,So weak it is useless,"The motor on this swing is so weak that it barely moves on full speed. It moves back and forth only an inch or two. When I turn on the mobile or music, the swinging almost stops completely. My son is only 10 lbs. I'm really disappointed and feel very ripped off. Its incredibly inconvenient to now have to disassemble the swing get it packed up and hauled to the post office to ship it back to Amazon. DO NOT BUY THIS. You'll regret it."
4,Great Swing,"This swing is perfect for infants as it reclines enough to allow them to either sleep or engage with the mobile. The best feature is that it plugs into the wall, so we don't have to keep replacing the batteries!"
2,It's dying after 2.5 babies.,"I'm on Amazon, shopping for a new swing right now. It made through 2 babies and now it's dying on it's 3rd and she's only 3 months old. Sometimes it works, other times it gets really loud and slows down until it's not moving anymore. She sleeps in it and won't sleep anywhere else. I have little choice but to buy a new swing and I'm irritated. The music/sound on it has never worked properly. You can sometimes kind of hear it but we stopped bothering with it a long time ago. I don't recommend it.I've also always wished it laid back flatter. Fisher Price has many other swings that lay back flatter, which is a safer sleeping position."
3,Alright swing.,"My son loves to be on the move and having this swing can be a HUGE help.Pros:-nice to look at-plugs into the wall or uses batteries-has a reclining seat-mobile is unique with the moving leaves-my son loves the aminals (both mobile and fabric)-swing can turn to different directionsCons:-tray is pretty much useless (my son kicks it open all the time so I just took it off)-my son is only 15 pounds but I have to put the swing to its highest setting and even now it doesn't get much momentum-the mobile will turn on even when it's individual setting is set off-it's difficult to choose the music setting with the sliding switch, I usually just slide it all the way over because it's too much of a hassle to chose one of the options in between."
3,Great swing - but not for colicky babies,"The ""hammock"" like feel of this swing did not appeal to my child at all, she had the Aquarium cradle swing before (from her older sister) and when it broke I purchased this one, she just screamed and screamed. If it had the solid seat like the aquarium swing it would have been great, but she really needed to have that secure feeling of being held in place. Beautiful swing, loved that you could plug it in too - wish I could have switched the seat out I would have taken it anyday over the battery guzzling Aquarium swing..."
2,would not recommend this product,"We bought this swing because of the ac adapter and also the music. We have had nothing but problems with it. After two weeks the music quit working, the swinging action sometimes worked. So we called Fisher Price and was sent a new mechanical part. Yet again the music has quit and the swing occasionally swings. I would look elsewhere for a different swing."
2,not good for chunky baby,"We thought this was going to be the perfect swing for our 2 month old. It plugs in, has a VERY cute mobile, good music, and swings in 2 different directions. Well, once we got it home and put our baby in it (2 months and 16 lbs) it looked like it was going to tip over! No matter what direction we put it in, the swing just wobbled like crazy. Although he loved it and smiled the whole time he was in it, it just wasn't safe for our little chunky guy. If you have a small baby, it would be great...but not for us."
5,great product for the price,"this is our second open top cradle swing. we had the ocean one before and pretty much used it until it died! the best part about this new model is that it has a wall plug! our daughter really loves the up and down movements of the leaves while the animals spin around on the mobile. i love the fact that the music and mobile are on a timer and after so long turn themselves off. this model was also less expensive than the first, but we purchased it two years ago when there were no other swings like it. overall great product for the money!"
3,music player broken.,"I haven't actually used this swing yet, but just a warning... I ordered my swing online and put it together. Not thinking about it, I threw my box away (which had my receipt on it) without trying out the swing. A few days later I purchased batteries and low and behold my music player was broken. So now I have a swing that swings, but does not play music! Don't forget to try it out before throwing the box away!"
4,Rainforest Cradle Swing,"This product's best feature is that it plugs into a power outlet. I had the Aquarium Swing prior to this one and the Rainforest Cradle Swing is nice, I just wish it had more bells and whistles like the Aquarium Swing did. Overall, my daughter loves this swing. Another nice feature that is that the seat swivels 180 degrees and she can sit upright or recline in it. I just wish the tray had some toys that she could play with. My daughter is 4 months old. We just attached rings to the tray and she loves to bat at them."
3,"Great swing, lousy motor","I received this swing as a gift. I love that it can be plugged in so you don't have to worry about batteries. My son likes that he can swing front to back and will often fall asleep in this position. He didn't much care for the side to side motion of the traditional swings, maybe when he's older. The mobile is ok but the angle on the seat makes it very difficult for my son to look at. I think the arm on the mobile should have been longer. The rainforest sounds are a nice option to annoying ""baby"" music. My BIGGEST complaint on this swing is the very weak motor. Sometimes it just stops and then can barely get going again. This wakes the baby up and I have to run over and swing it manually to calm him. It seems like after a while the swing warms up and is more consistent but this usually takes almost an hour and unless it's a really long nap my son will usually get bored before then. If FP could solve the motor issues this swing would rate much higher."
3,"The good, the bad and the blah","There are aspects of this product that were really good. I enjoy the option to plug in the swing, instead of having to use batteries. I also enjoyed the option to switch from side to side or front-to-back swinging motion. The mobile held my son's interest for about a month, and then he got bored. The music/rainforest noises stopped working after about two months, which was very irritating. However, while they did work, they were not annoying or obnoxious.Overall I enjoyed this swing, but would not purchase it again. I will probably donate it to Goodwill."
2,Great idea but motor not reliable,"We have a colicky/reflux baby and bought this in desperation to see if he would sleep in it. We had an older Graco swing that we used with our first two boys, but his little legs dangle in it and he just didn't seem comfortable. So we bought this one thinking that the cradle design would keep him more comfortable and the AC adaptor would help us save money on batteries.When the motor works, he sleeps great. He seems very comfortable in there. We keep it on the low speeds so that there is just enough motion to relax him. But we've only had this swing for 3 weeks and the motor has worked about 50% of the time. We've tried batteries and the adaptor, and about half the time we can't get any signs of life out of the motor.The music and mobile work great, but they aren't very soothing for a colicky baby so we don't use them.FP needs to work out the kinks in the motor and make the AC adaptor available on all their swings. This one is going back."
1,When a swing don't have that swing...,"We held off on our swing longer than anything else because a friend of ours had recommended getting one with an AC adaptor so we wouldn't have to replace any batteries. Finally, the rainforest swing became available and we snatched it up. It was cute, the colors were great, and it swung great when there was nothing in it.Then comes little Phoenix. Weighing in at a whopping 10lb 10ozs, he was definitely a little bigger than we had bargained for, but there shouldn't be any problem 'cause this swing holds up to 25lbs. Right? Wrong.The swing never got up to a strong swing and would usually peter out about 10 minutes and barely move. Also, after 2 months of using it for maybe a total of 2 hours, the music/mobile portion stopped working. Fantastic.So, my MIL got us a Graco swing that is rated up to 30lbs and it works like a charm. Plus, it's cheaper than this version. Phoenix sleeps in it, plays with his toys in it, and, most importantly, this swing swings. =)"
5,Lifesaver,"My baby loves this swing. When he is fussy, it really calms him down. The mobile is a nice touch. He loves to stare at the stuffed animals (and talk to them too!)"
2,cute....butttttttttttttttttttt,Is adorable ...worked for 2 days...then swing stops swinging...motor is bad on this item.. but good part was able to call fisher price and they sent new motor right away...hope it lasts...grand daughter loves it
5,A lifesaver!,"My 6 week old only wants to take naps if he is sleeping on me, and while I love snuggling with him, I need a break too! The swing has been my life saver because I can put him in the swing when he's falling asleep and he will, without fail, sleep in the swing for up to 2 hours. When he is not sleepy, he is fascinated by the moving mobile. I also like how I can move the mobile out of the way when I need to get him out of the swing. Also, the assembly wasn't hard to put together by myself. The only con I can think of is that the motor for the mobile is a little loud, though my son doesn't seem to mind at all!"
3,Questioning the quality...,"An hour after receiving we installed. The music worked, was very soothing, the colorful mobile leaves went up and down. However, the swing did nothing. We assumed it needed a push start, nothing. We switched outlets, used batteries, all ending in the same result. Naturally, I was upset. Immediately I called the customer service line on the back of the manual, they asked for the info on the warranty card, then informed me that they would send out a brand new motor, which included the mobile and toys. I was SO RELIEVED! I did not have to pack the whole thing up again and return it. She also informed me that because I had provided her with the warranty card info, my product was registered under it's one year warranty, and I would not need to send in the card. The representative on the phone was very nice, and professional. I am an extremely happy momma! I will definitely continue to purchase from their company."
5,Best Swing,I had this swing for my son. I love that it has a pull-in for the wall so you aren't spending an arm & a leg on batteries every month. I love that it's a cradle swing that turns into a regular swing. The mobile kept my son happy along with the cute music. Worth every penny. I also purchased this swing for a friend of mine as a baby shower gift. Her daughter enjoys it too. Great nap place!
5,Very comfortable.,"I love this swing. My baby always falls asleep in it 2 min after I place him in it. So I can have a bit of ""me"" time. I just wish they would create something like this in the adult size...hehehe"
2,highly disappointed,I am highly disappointed with this swing. It doesn't swing fast enough for my 1 month old and it doesn't even work with my friend's 7 month old. I even called Fisher Price and recieved a new motor and it still doesn't move very fast. Aside from the looks we have had nothing but trouble. The music also has a mind of it's own at times. I would never recommend this swing to anyone!
2,Review on Fisher-Price Rainforest Swing,"This product is very nice for a baby but the powercord wouldn't work, it would only run on batteries. Had to call Fisher-Price and they are sending new cord."
1,Was great until...,"The motor quit working! I purchased this swing in February and it quit working just yesterday. I called Fisher-Price and I guess I am not the only person with this problem. On the highest swing speed, it failed to move my 14 pound baby (the maximum weight limit is 25 pounds!). The motor was progressively getting louder before it quit working. I have since purchased the 'Ocean Wonders' swing. Personally, I feel that the 'Ocean Wonders' swing is a better choice. It gives you more room below for storage. It is also more colorful and provides more to entertain baby. (Not to mention it's nearly $20 cheaper!) Overall, I would not recommend this product, especially if your baby is dependent on a swing."
2,Very disappointed,"I was so excited when I bought this swing before my daughter was born. I loved the theme and the fact that it plugged in. I was still happpy with it when she first began to use it. She loved the theme as well and would nap and play in the swing. Unfortunately, we eventually ran into the same problem that others have. The motor is puking. It doesn't swing half of the time. This started happening about 2 months after we began using it.I hope that Fisher Price has corrected this problem (I bought it when it first came out) because if it wasn't for the problems with the motor, I would recommend this swing to everyone!"
3,"Couple glitches but hey, it plugs in!",Pros:AC adapter!Lift up mobileMultiple positions possibleRecline position is great (just like the Fisher Price Aquarium Swing)Washable cover (pretty standard)Cons:Tray table- seriously just complete waste of plastic and space. Do people actual use those?Swing and power- here's the deal- what I have found is that every Fisher Price swing that we have owned stops when a blanket comes near the floor causing drag or when the baby starts to get heavier (15+ lbs). Your best bet is to start the swing manually and then turn on the dial. An oddity unique to this swing is that if the swing is not locked into one of the positions (which is not all the simplistic to do) then it will tilt the baby to one side.Unimpressive mobile- the Ocean Wonders has a much better mobile.All in all if FP would make the Ocean Wonders swing with an AC adapter it would be the better choice... but since that isn't happening this is the best that I've found simply due to the AC adapter alone.
5,Love this Swing!!!,I bought this about 2 mo ago for our daughter to replace the battery operated one we had from when our son was little and it is great! It was a little more than I wanted to spend but totally worth it!! I love that it folds in half so is easy to move from room to room if needed and the fact that it plugs in is what sold me on it. I cannot imagine what we would have spent in batteries already and she is only 3mo old. She loves to swing and look at the mobile and the music is not too loud like some of the others we looked at.
3,Great swing... at least the parts that work...,"I loved this swing when I got it... great seat adjustment options, great mobile, great music options, and I loved that it plugged into an electrical outlet (and was not battery-operated like my Fischer-Price Aquarium Swing). However, the music functionality broke within 2-3 weeks of getting it. I called Fischer-Price customer service, and they sent me a new motor unit, no questions asked. I got the new motor within 3-4 days. Great, right? NOOOOOOOOO!!! The music functionality in the second unit broke, too, this time after about 4-5 weeks. I didn't even bother calling Fischer-Price again, and now we just use the swing and mobile, without music."
4,Alright,Our twin boys didnt really like this swing until they were 4 1/2 months old...they would cry and fuss to get out (guessing the colors were too much stimulation for them?). Now they are mesmerized by the mobile and enjoy the side to side motion. Nice that it plugs in and has an electric mobile. Easy to change from side to front mode. Overall we are happy with this.
3,Rock a bye baby,"Great product, baby loves the rocking swing motion and the rainforest sounds and toys etc... my only criticism is that with the rocking motion comes a mechanical noise that isn't overly soothing for the baby. If it wasn't for this noise I would rate the product 5 stars."
5,Great for Babies and Parents,"Our grandson already had one of these and we found it so very useful and has wonderful features like the ability to run off household current as well as battery operation, the choice of settings for speed, sound and motion. The seat cover and animals all being machine washable and the convenience of folding for storage and transport make this so easy and useful for childcare. We purchased this one as a gift for a friends baby shower and she is sure it will be well used too. The seat is adjustable and sturdy construction well thought out product. Would highly recommend this item."
3,Not for heavyweights!,"I have a big fat baby (20 pounds at 3 months. I know, I know...)Well, he didn't like to be in the swing when he was first born, and by the time he DID like it (a few weeks ago), he was to heavy for it! The swing would go at first, then slow down quickly, then almost stop completely.So we only got a good week or so of it actually semi-working. Also, there was always a faulty wire connectors in the back where we would have to squeeze them together through the fabric.We liked the a/c adaptor option, and I think ALL swings should be able to switch back and forth between plug in and batteries.With all of that said, we're off to return it. Sigh..."
4,My youngest isn't impressed...,"I had this exact same swing (only in a different pattern) for my oldest son, and he LOVED it. My younger son, however, won't stay in it for more than 20 minutes on a good day. I got this one because I like the features: plus into the wall (or can run on batteries), swings front to back and side to side, volume control, sound/music variety, swinging speed control, and what appears to be a very comfy seat (makes me want one!). My only complaints are: 1.) the volume, even on the lower of the 2 settings, is still fairly loud (especially if he's trying to go to sleep); 2.) the mobile is pretty loud as well. My younger son prefers his $35 vibrating bouncy seat to this $100 swing. Go figure."
2,"Great item, as long as it works.","Bought this as a Christmas present for my new grandson. Did not work correctly from the beginning - sound effects don't play. Otherwise, he loves it. I would give a much higher rating if everything worked on it; at least 4 stars. Bought the aquarium swing 7 years ago and was very happy with it. Like the fact that you can swing either forward-and-back, or side-to-side. Usually the swing will play different types of noise: music, rain, ocean waves, etc. Very soothing for babies. I would hightly recommend. Just hope you get a good one. I can't comment on the return service because I had it shipped to my daughter and she said she doesn't have time to deal with it."
2,Quality Control Needed,"We tried two of these swings with poor results. We had to send the first back because it would stop working while plugged in. We had to send the second back because the motor on the mobile was malfunctioning. Two is enough for us, I don't want to deal with a potential ""strike three."" I'm glad that Amazon is so good with returns, but repackaging that swing was a pain!"
4,Great Swing,"I got this swing as a gift when my second child was born. Although he wasn't a big fan of it and reached the weight limit much faster than we ever expected, it was great for our needs. I LOVE that the swing comes with an AC adapter and could be plugged in rather than going through batteries constantly. The music was soothing. My only complaint is that the mobile motor was really loud."
3,"Alright swing, but I have nothing to compare it to","Pros:Can swing back and forth or side to side.Battery or AC powered - not that I ever used batteries, I imagine it would eat them up.Helps baby sleep.Cons:Like others have said, sometimes the thing would just kind of grind down and barely swing, kind of annoying. I did make sure the seat was fully clicked into the desired swing direction.Almost all of the sound modes on mine did this crazy thing where it would sound like an old modem connecting, then jumble all the sound modes together. Because of this I was limited to the nature sounds mode with light music. That sound mode was nice at least, but I liked the songs on the other mode, I just had to be ready to switch it when the modem thing started (although it never seemed to bother baby).---All in all this thing worked pretty well, helped baby sleep while she was not liking the crib so much. I'd probably try another one next time."
4,Great Swing,"This was a nice choice for a swing.. I was looking for one that didn't require batteries and this one fits the bill. And the kid loves it to, although I think he would still rather be held."
1,Wonky!!,"Terribly LOUD motor powering the swing and the mobile right out of the box, it sounds like it's struggling to run. The pillow was sewn on crooked and off to one side. Can't imagine a swing manufactured any cheaper than this, doesn't seem to stable. I paid for two-day shipping but it took a week before it was delivered. It's going back."
3,"motor died after 4 months, but good customer service","My baby has never been a swing baby. Some babies are, some babies aren't. He was just starting to be able to fall asleep in the swing, when it broke at months. Now even though my son doesn't love the swing, it is still a place to safely place your little one while you run to the bathroom, grab a drink, etc. I was so annoyed. We used the thing maybe a maximum of 20 minutes a day. Luckily, the warranty is for a year, so I was able to have Fisher Price send me out a replacement motor. I will update if anything goes wrong."
1,Typical Fisher Price - motor blows in a few months,"Everything by Fisher Price is craptastic. This swing in no exception.Despite the cheap materials (plastic and polyester) we expected the motor to work.I tried the swing with an 8 pound weight and it worked weakly. Ahen with a 16 pound weight and the swing barely budged.I phoned Fisher Price. They told me if the product is in warranty, they can send a motor. If not, I will have to pay $50 for one.I have combed through so many swing reviews on Amazon. Crappy motors are very typical of Fisher Price. Some people have gone through 3 or 4 motors in a year.How many of these throwaways end up in landfills every year? Makes me think they make these lousy on purpose. So you can never actually use a swing with more than one kid.This swing is crap and it is going back.Mamaroo here we come...."
2,A step back in cradle swings,We bought this a while ago and it is the second baby swing we've bought and we no longer use it because it's not as good as the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing (a previous generation Fisher-Price swing) which was our first swing (the motor died) and current swing (we found another one used). This swing seems to have all the right features on paper but when it comes to real world use our baby naps longer and keeps herself entertained longer in the Ocean Wonders swing than when she is in the Rainforest swing. I really hope Fisher Price brings back the mechanics of the older swing with the features of this swing (read: power plug) by the time we have another child.
1,piece of junk,Installed in a 1989 Corvette. Doesn't flow enough coolant at idle to operate heater. Entire system has been tested...conclusion is lack of water pump volume at idle.Extremely disappointing after going out of my way to find an OEM replacement. AC Delco is not what it used to be.
2,Boring,Bought this hoping it would help motivate me to train more on my indoor trainer. Not! This video is pretty boring and not high on the motivation factor. Might have good technical training programs but don't buy it hoping to help motivate you and make training more enjoyable. Music is not good and instructor is low energy.
2,"High intensity, deadly dull","If you are looking for the combination of serious spinning and creative, high quality audio/visual this is not for you. This is of the ""this is serious training and shouldn't be fun"" school. Well sorry, I can suffer and smile at the same time. Specifically, there was little or no attention placed on choosing music that was 1) good and 2) beat coordinated to the sets. It is, however, a serious plain vanilla interval workout-although short at 45 minutes. It is shot with some of the guy's students set up on trainers at a homely lakeside setting while he walks around in highschool football coach garb incessantly instructing while holding a stopwatch.Anyone with extensive spinning experience could get pretty much the same thing by choreographing their own workout, turning on the radio and using a stopwatch. There is a reason why music is carefully coordinated into this type of workout: it makes work feel like dance. This is more like a Calvinst sermon than a night at the club."
3,Lasted 5 Months,"I debated whether to give this 2 or 3 stars. In the end I gave it 3 since it did work as promised though I was disappointed by how long the bulb lasted. Back in August, I bought two of these for a 10 gallon planted tank. The plants did fairly well. I can't blame the lighting on any of their problems. It did give a much better look to the tank than the stock incandescent bulbs did. The first week of January (not even 5 months later) I come to find one of the bulbs had already burnt out. I'm not sure what the life expectancy is of these but would figure longer than this. In the end I went to Petco and bought its equivalent for one dollar more and didn't have to wait for it to ship."
1,product not as displayed in image,"the image displayed a color max bulb and an actinic bulb per order, what I go tin actuality was just one colormax bulb, I found this misleading as I was expecting two bulbs of two different kinds for the price I paid..."
3,A breakfast on the go.,"After my first bite, I thought this stuff tasted like cardboard. After a while, though, it's not too bad if you're into health foods. As a breakfast, though, I've found that it will give me energy throughout the morning. It's not Mrs. Fields is all I can say."
2,Not A Helathy Breakfast,"This review is for the Banana Walnut Breakfast Cookies.The bag says "" We bake cookies for people just like you looking for the perfect healthy snack on the go."" With 8 grams of fat, 52 grams of carbohydrates, 17 grams of sugar, 250 mg of sodium and only 6 grams of protein this is not a healthy breakfast. Although it tastes pretty good, I would warn people who are interested in a healthy grab ang go breakfast to look elsewhere."
5,I was surprised how good these were,"I haven't tried any of the other flavors yet, but this is a great cookie and it's great for breakfast. This doesn't have the sawdust taste/texture that you'd expect from a product like this."
4,Es hora de escuchar a la Orquesta.,"Manteniendose siempre ironicos, los Mondragon bajo la Batuta de su lider Javier Gurruchaga han mantenido a Espana riendose de si misma. Recomendamos su disco ""Ellos Las Prefieren Gordas"", que es la gran parodia de las grasas y la obsesion de la juventud y la curvilinealidad. Esta antologia de 21 exitos confirman lo que esta orquesta siempre dio: buen y bufonesco rock and roll."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. EVERYTHING STICKS TO IT!! IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN. I only hope I can sell it a garage sale for 2cents as that is all it is worth!!
1,Junk,Don't bother with the cheap monitor cables. I had to exchange this for a better cable because when I used it I got ghosting bad.
4,Excellent study of how Germany and Japan dealt with war guilt,"Ian Buruma travels to Germany and Japan to see how they are dealing with their guilt over what happened in World War Two. In this well-paced and well-researched work, he shows how West and East Germany at least tried hard in their own ways to to explain to their populations what had happened. The Japanese chose to gloss over the atrocities and in this work at least, come off as highly unimpressive and ambiguous. Buruma makes the point that part of the problem was the U.S. decision to let the emperor stay in power and to forbid criticism of him. So the man the troops dedicated their battles to all through the war stayed on the throne, which made it difficult to persuade the nation that it should be guilty about its past. The only reason I give this four stars is because the author jumps back and forth too often and the result is chapters that are sometimes very fragmented."
5,great travel bag,This bag was great for airplane travel! It fit perfectly under the seat in front of me with a tiny bit of room to spare. I was concerned it was going to be a little too tall but it was perfect! The dog was very comfortable and loved looking out the sides while we were in the airport. It was nice to be able to put the sides down when were on the plane so he knew it was time to go to sleep. It is even stylish! most people didn't even realize I had a dog with me! All in all this was a great purchase! I would recommend this bag to anyone looking to travel with their pet!
4,great.,"this thing is great. my cat hates cat carriers so i can't say he loves this thing but in terms of fashion and comfort to carry and calming my cat down once he's in the carrier, it's great. the flaps are really nice because he gets really freaked out when he sees too many people or hears too many noises. the pockets are nice to fit in a few wipes and snacks and whatever else he needs. the only complaint i might have is that it's hard to close it when he's trying to escape. like, i needed a second pair of hands to hold him down while i zipped it up. once he got in everything was cool...but, it was harder than it needed to be to get him in. then again, i'm thinking that's my cat's fault. and cat's are amazing escape artists, as we all know."
3,Nice bag but too small,This is a really well made and nice bag but just too small for my cat. The description said it could hold up to 17 lbs but my 15 lb cat barely fit so I will return and by the Ultimate Pet Bag in Large. Highly recommend for cats and dogs that are 10 lbs. and under. Anything heavier would just not fit and would be uncomfortable.
5,This is THE pet carrier to get!,"I am very impressed with the quality and size of this product. This is definitely the pet carrier you have been looking for! It is very stylish and does not look like a pet carrier. Please note that as discussed by other reviewers, the size description on Amazon is INCORRECT. The correct dimensions from the Sherpa box are: 18""L x 10.5""H x 11""D. Bag weight is 3.6 lbs. Also, the Amazon picture shows that it comes with a matching luggage tag. It does not. You are on your own for that. Nice storage compartment for toys, treats, etc. Flaps can roll down to maintain privacy and increase durability in large crowds. Would highly recommend this as your pet bag of choice. All the others seem to pale in comparison to this one. You will not be disappointed."
5,Fits Great!,I had bought this a while back when I had just adopted my cat from a breeder and needed to transport her from NY to CA. AA did not have an issue with the carrier size. She was 6 months old and only 6 pounds. I wanted a carrier that would also fit her when she's full grown for when I take her to the vet. My cat is now 14 pounds and it fits her still.
4,Pretty carrier,This seems to be a nice carrier. We will test it out this spring on flights. Our mini dachshund seems to fit in the carrier just fine.
5,Great CookBook,"I have had this book before and I knew that there were valuable recipes in it, so after I got a home to live in, I had to replace this book immediately"
3,Nice carrier but not for women with large breasts,This carrier is well made and simple to use with a newborn but if you have large breasts like I do then it can be a little challenging to wear. With larger breasts there isn't a lot of extra room for baby. Overall the carrier is comfortable and doesn't hurt my back or shoulder but the cloth can sometimes cover baby's face too much.
1,My Baby Hates This!,"My son was about 4 months old when I bought this, and was in the stage where he wanted to be held 24/7. He was about 12 pounds at the time. Every time I put him in the sling he cried like a maniac. It looked incredibly uncomfortable for him, his neck was all scrunched up. On the plus side, it was comfortable for ME...if my baby hadn't hated it maybe it would've worked. Also, I was confused becaues NO WHERE on the product did it say 'New Native' which was the whole reason I had purchased the product online, due to favorable reviews of that specific product. Pretty disappointed. My son likes the Bjorn carrier and the Moby wrap better. The Moby wrap is a pain to put on and gets really hot but it has it's good points, namely your kid doesn't look like he's suffocating."
5,It's All in the Name,"My son is in the 5th grade and he loves Bob Lanier's series. My son is typically not a reader but this year I have added reading 30 minutes per day to his daily schedule. I purchased 3 of the books in Bob Lanier's series (I think that is all that is out) and he enjoys reading them. He reads them fast too. In a book report he recently did, he wrote that he liked the book because the kids were his age, some of them were his same race and the main character liked a lot of things he did and had some of the same problems.I've read this book too and I like it for my son. I am so happy that this series has encouraged him to read. I am looking for more series like this."
2,Not Convincing,Author does a decent review of SOME of the facts; his conclusion that AE simply ditched is no more convincing than TIGHAR's theory she crash landed on Gardner Island.
3,Amelia Earhart : The Mystery solved,Somewhat disappointed with this book as similar conclusions to 'Loomis's' book which I feel had a better summary of what might have happened. E Long does not make comment on a lot of witness accounts which appear to be substantiated in other earlier books. Have been following this History since 1972 when I read F Loerner's book.
1,What happened to copy editing?,"Once again I have begun reading a book from a highly reputable publishing house only to find a sloppy job of fact checking and copy editing. For example, in the same sentence on page 54 I found ""Later J.K. Lilly of the Eli Lilli (sic) Company..."" If even proper names are spelled wrong, how can you trust what the author has written? It is such a turn-off while reading that often I just stop and either give the book away or take it right back to the library."
5,simply elegant,THE RING WAS SIMPLE AND ELEGANT. GARNET IS MY BIRTHSTONE AND IT WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED. I MAY ORDER ANOTHER FOR MY DAUGHTER IT'S HER STONE TOO.
3,Good for the Price,"I purchased this as a gift and my friend liked it alot. However, the metalchanged color a bit."
5,"Small, subtle, and brilliant",This is a small ring and I really like it. I can wearing it on my pinky finger and have a larger ring on my ring finger without the two of them clanging against one another.I wear this ring often and notice no obvious dings or places of wear.
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this item as the lines on the page are way to small to write on. The original one that came with the planner was perfect, just the right size. I thought that this one was the same as the original or I wouldn't have purchased it."
4,Day-Timer,It is A very good Product but expensive compared to getting a new product of another Comparable brand to replace Day-Timer.
4,Good value,"Good value and very convenient. These are sometimes hard to find in stores like Office Depot, Office Max, Target, and Staples"
4,This book should be a movie!,"This book was very informative. Not only did I have a great read, but I learned something as well. Kilpack did her homework. This story and character felt real, alive, and I completely related to her story. I should also mention that I stayed up all night reading, and well into the next day. I was hooked from the start. A great book with acurate detail and description, so much so, that I could not see any flaws with the story line. I was completely there. Be prepared to get hooked!"
3,Don't Buy Black! You'll want to send them back!,"I Love the feel and the fit of the microwear long john pants. I don't like the color black as they collect every little bit of lint, fuzz, pet hair, just about anything my legs come in contact with! I can't say if it is just the color or the fabric. Either way, I look like I just slept with ALL OF MY Animals within a few minutes of putting on my pants!"
3,A trip down memory lane,"The video is in grainy black and white and the broadcaster is not Jack Brickhouse. Other than that, I found the dvd rather enjoying."
4,"SPC ""Krazy""",Ok to start with this knife itself has a 5 star review. What 4 stars is for is for the stupid Ka-bar people for not having any type of straps to go with the knife (none come with the sheath!)I'm currently deployed in Afghanistan and this irritates me to no end at all that this came with no straps! I had purchased it as a close quarters weapon but lo and behold i can't even use it for that!I use this knife currently when i perform any type of cooking and it works great! It came fairly sharp and it's strong enough that if i needed to pry anything open i wouldn't have a second thought about using this knife on it. I highly recommend this knife for anyone but for the fact of the straps as i said. This mere fact irks me to no end and the horrible thing is i can't find any for it! If anyone knows ANYPLACE to buy the proper straps then please let me know! The holes are very small and i may just need to go with jimmy rigging it to myself.
5,"Don't waste your time thinking, just buy it!","Best buy for the price! Ka-Bar product is outstanding. Everything and more. Minor sharpening, but hey that's just me. Very fast shipping too. You wont regret it!"
5,nice!,"What can I say besides, this is a KaBar, its diesel and I love it. Just know that the blade is really long."
5,Great feeling knife,Just got this knife the other day. Very impressed with the balance and feel of the blade. Would recommend for anyone.
4,"Great knife, poorly made sheath.","The knife itself is great and I have no doubt it is a highly effective and tough weapon. The sheath could use some work though. For starters, this is supposed to be a tactical knife. With that in mind, I find that the buttons make noise when they are not snapped. This is important if noise is an issue. Also, the center button is coming loose only after using it maybe 10 or 20 times. The loose button is causing the finish of the blade to become worn due to contact with the blade when inserting and removing the blade from the sheath. Other than that its a great knife. I am probably going to return the sheath to Ka Bar and request a new one. Also, its nearly impossible to find a replacement sheath for this knife. I can find 7"" replacement sheaths but not 8"" ones."
1,good knife terrible company.,"This knife is great, you really can't go wrong with a ka-bar. However the company that ships the knives to amazon for fulfillment is called Nidacast and they are down right terrible! I would recommend the knife itself for sure it's easily a 4 star blade, but I will personally never deal with Nidacast again and you should not either unless you have no other choice."
3,Not for the casual collector,"100 dollars for a tactical knife like this quite a bit to spend, considering it's illegal to conceal and downright unwieldy to use. However, if you do a lot of hunting, or you're in the military, I can see it coming in handy. One thing to watch out for: some Ka-Bars are made in the US, others are made in China. Watch out for those Chinese Ka-Bars; while they ARE cheaper, the quality of materials is lower, thus a lower quality knife. Summing it all up, an 8-inch blade might seem cool, but come on, when are you ever gonna use it?"
4,Ka-Bar black Tanto,Overall a great knife the only complaint I have is that the handle was chipped on delivery and the whole exchange process is a nuisance. But it's a great knife.
5,Amazing blade,"I have owned many knives through out my life, and this knife in particular has to be the best. I am having a hard time deciding for when SHTF if I would rather take this knife or my handmade full tang katana. If you're having issues deciding if you want this knife let me be the devil on your shoulder and say BUY IT! Its amazing to say the least."
5,Ka-Bar tough!,"I was leery about batonning wood with this when I saw the top ""edge"" on the spine, which isn't actually sharp, but it held up well. I split wood a bit thicker than what a normal bushcraft knife would do, but so far that is all I have done with it. Also comes with a great sheath, I like the locking ability you can use with out snaps."
4,Feels like a mini katana,Bought this knife just because I always wanted a Ka-Bar knife. I am pretty happy with what I got. It comes with a hard plastic sheath and the sheath can be attached to a belt. The knife has a good weight to it and is a really good combat knife which Ka-Bars are supposed to be. Out of the box it came decently sharpened but I sharpened it again just because I wanted it more sharp. Overall good buy for me and I am happy with what I got.
5,Big Boy Toy,My 16YO wanted this for tactical practice. It's sharp and a good size for him. Would buy it again. Like
5,best knife I own,"I didnt think Ka-Bar could do any better than they already had, I was wrong, Extremely well made, balanced, razor sharp, I carry this knife with me almost every day, Gave the Ka-bar I got in the service to my son. I think this one will be with me till the grave. Probably the best knife I have ever owned!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Sturdiness of Knife in Question,"Within the first few days of using this knife, it bent where the knife and handle meet. I was doing hard work with it and after a while, I looked at it and noticed that it was bent at a slight angle. It did not measure up to what I believe it was meant to."
5,This knife rocks,"The Knife arrived early and I am impressed. For the dude that his was not sharp enough, this is not a razor but real close.A friend and I have 3 of these they are real nice for the kayak, hunting and good truck knife."
3,One Problem,"I am reading this book now, and it is enjoyable enough. Nicholas is an honarable man. He has reformed since returning from the Crusades, and he does not deny his son in the least, nor does he rip him away from the life he has known. But, if you know anything about types of speech in England, you'll soon notice that the prevalent use of ""lad"" and ""lass"" is quite out of place. Thos are terms used in Scotland."

5,Excellent Tutorial,"This is one of the best videos that I've seen explaining the way to improve your digital photography. It covers basics, but in a way that is interesting and visually instructive. Well done."
4,The Journey of Genetics,"The Journey of Man, recently recommended by a friend in Dallas, is a story of state-of-the-art genetic research to trace the geographic history of homo sapiens based on, as I understand it, polymorphisms or mutations in human DNA. The idea is that by identifying these and analyzing their frequency of occurance in various areas of the world, the sequence in which they occurred can be deduced and, thus, the associated physical path by which we populated the world can be identified. The conclusion is that homo sapiens began about 50,000 years ago in north-eastern Africa, then spread to Australia, etc. The thought process nicely ties in related data from archaeology, anthropology, and other sciences to support and/or refute the genetic results. A very good book, aimed at laymen and easy to read, although not particularly well-edited and sometimes over-uses analogies to the point that you wish he'd just go ahead and say it."
2,Too dumbed-down,"This was a major letdown. While one might be somewhat entertained by it, you won't come away from it with any understanding of anything. The writing is vague and the scientific methods are hardly mentioned. I suppose the author or his editors were afraid of scaring people. Here's the entire description of restriction enzymes: ""...biochemical techniques can generate DNA fragments of a particular length based on their sequence."" That's it. He manages to take a few sentences to vaguely describe gel electrophoresis, but of course never bothers to use the term ""gel electrophoresis."" Don't bother with this one."
3,The Journey of Man: A genetic odyssey,"The book's condition was described by the vendor as ""very good"". However, several chapters had underlining in pencil. Condition would probably be described as ""good"". No big deal! I'm sure the book will read fine.Nancy"
1,"Response to ""Journey Of Man""","Although the topic of the show was one that interests me enormously (I am a professor of History), I was truly shocked by the blatant sexism of the content. Were there no women involved in the early journeys of (as you kept repeating) ""mankind""? It is not necessary to keep up some boring his/her referencing, but it is necessary to throw in the occasional woman as a member of the human race.E. HealeyPrinceton, NJ"
4,Interesting book,"I would say that you could get the basic argument of the book in a 20-page summary or from reading the other reviews. Especially early in the book, the technical terms can be a little confusing. It was a fine and interesting book, I just wouldn't give it the highest rating."
3,"Good journey, lousy maps","I enjoyed reading in this book how scientists worked out the migration patterns of prehistoric humans through the dissection of Y-chromosome (and the ladies' mtDNA too) genetic markers. The author's analogies to explain the various genetic theories are fairly good at explaining the concepts.My problem with the paperback edition (I have not seen the hardcover)is that the maps are horrendous. They look like they were photocopied from color originals with a really old machine. I cannot read the text on the arrows of the Big Summary Map at all, and have been writing in the genetic markers on the map in the book as I go along to see if I can figure it out for myself. And I never, never, never write in my books. This is very frustrating and the publisher should ensure that the maps are recreated with gray-scale halftones in the next edition.I recommend looking into whether the hardcover edition maps are any better and get that if they are."
4,Held my interest,"I read this book in my free time over the course of three days, so obviously it held my interest. One would certainly need to read further to get a real understanding of the geneticists' methods, but this book wasn't meant to be a graduate level text. The account of human migration out of Africa is even better when accompanied by the migratory maps on the Genographic Project's web site. Minor criticisms: the photographs are stuck in the middle of the book without notes or explanation, and I could have done without the obligatory recitation of the PC we-are-all-the-same-despite-our-obvious-hereditary-differences mantra. The book has not convinced me to submit a sample to the Genographic Project: I don't need to pay 99 bucks to be told that my parents were European."
2,Impressively little content.,"One doesn't learn a lot about evolutionary genetics from this book. When the author talks about how statisticians arrive at a result he does a really poor job of explaining the calculation for a layman. He presents almost nothing at all, just stating results. The book contains a lengthy list of results from many different fields. Most people want to know a lot more about how the various quantities are deduced, even a newspaper article goes more in depth. Science via inductive logic is a little sketchy, but you get the impression that the author doesn't understand that what he studied in grad school is inductive. One receives the impression that the author doesn't question much of anything at all.This is a book about everything he learned as a post-doc, all the people that he met, and all of their theories. But, I don't think that many people will take anything away from The Journey of Man - it lacks the substance that readers of layman's science books desire."
3,Different complaint,"I thought Wells did a very good job of explaining the subject as of 2003 (don't know how much has changed since then). I think the accusations of sexism (? he was tracking the Y chromosome, after all, and explained why) or PC prisiness are unfounded. And yes, the mixed metaphors were frequent and not always that helpful. But what bothered me was the all the Britishism in the text. Knowing that the author is not British, but grew up in Texas, of all places, and didn't move to the UK till a bit over a decade ago, all the ""travellers"" and ""have a goes"" and bollards, temperatures and distances given in Cs and meters, etc. really annoyed me to a distracting degree. Was he writing for a British audience? Then why no ""US"" edition? A small point, substantively speaking, but stylistically off enough to make it hard to get through at times."
5,THIS WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!,"This book is a companion to the amazing documentary that was on PBS a month ago. Revealing that all mankind which is not surprising comes from one tribe in Africa and that particular tribe is still living on till this day. How one part of that African tribe traveled through India, China, Australia to Alaska and North America. What is amazing is Spencer Wells does genetic tests in each land area to find men(they carry the chromosome)who are a direct linkage to the African tribe. It is amazing research that will leave you speechless, finally genetic proof that we ARE ALL RELATED!"
4,I Suppose It's Good For Me,"Our author takes the position that not only are we the product of the ""dumbing down of America"", but we've allowed our thought processes to become ""dumbed down"" as well. She then gives us a series of essays to prove her point, essays that are peppered with obscure words utilizing their most obscure meanings! I ran for my Websters soft cover dictionary, but had to resort to my unabridged for most of them. She does make some good points about how inacurate research has developed some long-held ideas resulting in flawed thinking. And, I suppose resorting to long sessions with the dictionary is good for me. All in all, I felt this to be a thoughtful and engaging book."
1,The prose is poor; the substance evidences hysteria.,"Ms. Robinson's prose style is turgid and pretentious. She follows a rule of avoiding simple English if obscure words may be found. She searches far and wide for such words and finds quite a few for which she may be congratulated, but hardly praised. Substantively, she observes: ""One need not have an especially excitable or a particularly gloomy nature to be persuaded that we may be approaching the end of the day."" Come now, Miss Robinson, that is both excitable and gloomy; it approaches hysteria. Having used nine essays to prove that Man has lost his soul, his way and his intelligence, she concludes with a standard environmental diatribe which focuses on the present-day dangers to the Koala bear.Miss Robinson needs less Calvin and more Prozac."
2,Scamps-bored us,"I am a grandma who would buy anything my child wanted if I could. I ordered this because my granddaughter asked for it after seeing in on TV. We opened it up the night before herbirthday to see what it was like, my granddaughter is a normal 8 year old with a love of animals. However, once opened my husband and I found this slow reacting hard feeling toy to bea disappointment. It was so slow reacting that it bored even us. Repeating the command slowely three times was just to frustrating. We view this as a toy that will be pushed aside and never loved by our 8, 4, and 2 year olds. We returned it more that happy to take the deduction because it was opened. I would notorder this item again. I had read a review from a child that said it was slow reacting and boring, I wish I had listened to her."
1,Save your money,"This dog is terrible. My seven year old saved and scrimped and was INSTANTLY disapointed and frustrated with this toy. It doesn't follow commands, the batteries die quickly and it is way overpriced."
2,Scamps my playful pup,"My daughter too was heartbroken when the dogs neck broke, she is 6 almost 7, and very careful with her toys. She had the toy one day and it is no longer working. I am going to return it and try again, but of course you can't find it now. For the price it is not worth it, but when your child really wants something and it is the only thing she asks Santa for, how do you say no."
2,Not that great,"This puppy in my house has been named Sugar. Unfortunately, Sugar does not live up to my expectations. It goes through batteries quickly and once those batteries run out, you start all over in training that darn dog. I must say, I am not sure the dog is really ""trainable"". It does the same tricks over and over again and doesn't ever improve or get any cuter. In my eyes, there are better toys out there for the same amount of money spent for this one."
3,Not worth it!,"When I first got Scamps, I was really excited that I could teach it cute tricks, but once I put the batteries in it it wasnt that good. I tried to teach it commands but it would not listen to me. It just fell asleep. Its a cute dog, but you should not waste your money for something that doesnt do what its supposed to do."
4,furreal cool!!!!!!!!!!!!,scamps is so fun i got him for christmas and i love him u should also get 1 there only 50.00 it works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Classic Rand despite contributions of Peikoff and Schwartz,"This collection of Ayn Rand's essays includes some hard-to-find classics (""Global Balkanization,"" ""The Sanction of the Victims,"" and ""Apollo 11,"" for example) and a couple of duds (notably ""About a Woman President"").The biggest duds, however, are the additional essays provided by Leonard Peikoff and Peter Schwartz, who apparently couldn't leave well enough alone. Peikoff's essays aren't terrible, but his placing them next to Rand's simply makes obvious what a pretentious and derivative thinker he really is. And Schwartz's ill-considered ravings against ""Libertarianism: The Perversion of Liberty"" (particularly his attacks on the late great Murray Rothbard, compared to whom Schwartz is a gnat), far from meriting description as the ""voice of reason,"" do not deserve to be published here or anywhere else.Buy this book for Rand's essays, but read around the extras thrown in by a couple of mediocre hangers-on."
4,Slow read...excellent,"As an Ayn Rand fan, this book is an excellent look into her background thoughts and ideals. Nice break, and great reference inbetween reading the Fountainhead...again and again."
2,Disappointing,"There are some good exercises in this book. However, if you have not done ab exercises regularly and you are looking for a program to get you started (especially if you are working out at home!), this book is not for you. Although the writer does address readers with weak abs, he does not provide an adequate beginner's program, which would prepare you for the more difficult moves. Furthermore, you need some serious equipment if you want to follow this ""14-day ab sculpting workout"" (which is, in fact, a 14-WEEK workout, broken into 2-week-sections"").If you already have pretty strong and toned abdominals and are getting bored with your routine, AND have access to an 'ab high chair' and a cable station, along with the obligatory Swiss ball, you might find some challenging exercises in the ""Body Bible for Abs"".Otherwise, keep browsing for a better book."
5,Excellent price!,The day planner Takes care of all my day planning ! I would recommend it to anyone. Good value for what I paid for it.
2,Looks great wide width too narrow,I have purchased many shoes from this vendor and never had a problem with my 7 1/2 wide fitting very good. This style was just too narrow in a wide width
1,Damaged package,"I am totally disappointed with this purchase. The box looked like repackaged. The handle and Pressure Switch was broken right out of the box, so I have to call Bostitch for those parts replacements. It's been a month now and I still have not seen them. Since Amazon don't stand behind this kind of product, I am out of luck. My suggestion is to buy it from your local hardware store and save the headache."
4,Good package for the do it yourselfer,"I recently refinished the bar room in my hose and used a friends porter cable pancake with a PC Brad nailer and a Bostitch Finish nailer. I went looking for the saem combination of tools for myself for future endeavors. I decided on this combo pack. i like the easy depth adjustment knobs on the bostitch guns over the P&C. Unpacking was easy, although documentation for the compressor is quite limited, if you have never used one before, this might be a task. I had it unpacked and was nailing trim in about 25 minutes. Watch out for the tank moisture drain, mine was sent with this open so I was unable to build pressure out of the box, took a few minutes to adjust and tweak, and again, the documentation telling how to do this was limited."
2,Broken and frustrated,"When I recieved the box it had been retaped for security and you could here, what I found to be dessicant, rattling in the box. When I opened the box the 18 ga nailer was missing along with the nails and oiler. The handle was broken and I continued to find damage to the motor shroud up to the day I packed it up for return.I have been in touch with your company and after many e-mails and phone calls to Stanley Bostich, at your direction. They then directed me to get back intouch with you. I also had to call your customer service department. My new package will be arriving before Dec 4. The projected date. It is in Illinouis(spelling) somewhere. So as you can see I have not been able to rate the product. Ralph"
1,Get what you pay for,"Bought it from a big box store. Worked for a while, but had to get it fixed twice. 3rd time around it was only good for parts. Spend a little more, get something decent is my new motto."
2,Buy carefully,"Everything arrived intact, but when I plugged in the compressor, it ""hummed"" and wouldn't run at all. I finally got it to work somewhat, but then it would freeze up at about 20 psi. Also, the drain plug doesn't work at all, it just lets air run out and you can't tighten it. Seems like a good deal, but be prepared for problems with this kit. I'm sure the guns work well, but who knows when I'll be able to actually try them, I'm calling Bostitch."
3,Secret Star (The stars of Mithra),Loved the story! Read all three books back to back. Couldn't put them down. Characters were unforgettable!!! I never read a NORA ROBERT'S STORY I DIDN'T LIKE..
5,Enjoyed these three immensely!,"If you're in the mood for great romance and fast moving adventure, The Stars of Mithra are terrific. I especially love how the male and the female characters are strong; they have other lovely qualities, but it's particularly refreshing to read a book where the men and women are equally respected. Be sure and read about Bailey first, then M.J., and then Grace. Wonderful!Nicki"
4,Good,Definitely a book that keeps you on your toes. Started out a little slow pace but had an exhilarating ending.
4,Secret Star,"This is the second book I read of the Stars of Mithra, I enjoyed the book reminded me of the oldmovie Laura. I would like a little less sex and more story."
3,good reading.,love how Nora pulls it all together and puts a twist on it. Once I pick up a book from Nora or J.D. Robb I can't put it down.
5,Stars of Mithra Trilogy,"I can't say enough about Nora Rpberts books. I am constantly scanning for titles I haven't read. Yep, I've read a whole lot and if it out there, I'll find it. Usually in threes!"
1,NOT ENJOYABLE,"I AM SUCH A FAN OF NORA ROBERTS, THAT I FEEL BADLY GIVING THIS A TERRIBLE REVIEW. IT DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST, I FORCED MYSELF TO FINISH, HOPING IT WOULD GET BETTER, ALAS IT DID NOT."
2,Very Poor Version of Cop Saves Heiress Storyline,"This storyline has already been written -- and much more sucussfully. I wouldn't be surprised if Nora Roberts has a more well crafted version within her own booklist. Both heroine and hero are just too unlikeable, emotionally guarded and manipulative to pull of, with any credibility, their lightning speed attachment. Unable to make it through the entire book, I began skimming before I was even halfway through the story in order to learn the ending. In the end I could have predicted that as well. Fortunately, I borrowed this book for Kindle from my public library. I'm still curious about the previous titles in the trilogy (those heros and heroines as mentioned in SS seem somewhat more likable) but I'm only willing to invest a trip to the library on this NR series."
4,Another great book by one of my favorite authors,"First off I love Nora Roberts. I will eventually get each and every one of her books read. She is just amazing. This series was a really good series. I love a man in uniform and this set didn't disapoint. This was the best of the three book series in my opinion and I would highly recommend it. Her McGregor series is still my favorite, but this one was great too."
4,Lucky find,Read the first two of this older Nora Roberts series & couldn't find the final. It came quickly so I could hop back in. Thanks!
2,A bad ending to a good series,"I loved the first 2 in this trilogy. I finished both Hidden Star and Captive Star in one weekend. I wish I had stopped there. I liked Grace (the heroine of this book) better when she was just casually discussed by the other characters. Once we actually meet her, I have a hard time understanding how Bailey and MJ could be best friends with her. She is calculating and conniving. She tries to manipulate people by using sex appeal. I wasn't really fond of the hero, but I thought he deserved better than Grace. I gave this 2 stars only because it closes off the trilogy. If this book had been a stand alone book, I would have rated it 1 star."
2,not a page turner,"While I read the first two books in one night...it tooks me weeks to finish Secret Star. I even read three books in between ): The first two in this series were exciting and the romances were developed much better than Seth and Grace's. I didn't care for Grace, especially. And the whole past lives thing thrown in at the end was unbelievable...I don't care for the villain being so quickly and clumsily introduced it left me just wanting to end the book and find out more about MJ and Bailey which I would have loved to hear more about. Finish the series, but don't expect a compelling read..."
5,Don't Be Blinded,"Gabrielle Hamilton's piece in the NY Times was brilliant. She was not discriminating against anybody. She was observing how her reactions to a blind man applying for the position of line cook were conflicted and how guilty she felt. I thought it was one of the more unique pieces of food writing that the new New York Times has published. It certainly made me want to read the book, and it did not dissapoint. A bit for everybody and if you like to follow the food world certainly entertaining. [...] This is not a book about chefs being mean to blind people who want to cook, this is a book about people who love to cook and how they make the harsh environment they work in work for them."
1,Didn't bother to use spelling/grammar check,"Several of the chapters are quite entertaining, especially if you're a fan of Kitchen Confidential type stories. Unfortunately, the many grammatical and spelling typos were too distracting for me to truly enjoy the book. When practically every introduction has at least one typo, I is frequently replaced with a 1, and an entire paragraph from a previous chapter is spliced into the middle of a following chapter it became too much for me. Editing like this really shouldn't be allowed commercially and I would certainly like the money back I spent on the Kindle version of this book."
3,Mixed Plate,"Some of the pieces in this book are really funny, such as a tale of what happened when a hollandaise delivery met up with LA rush hour traffic. Many remind the reader than even the greatest of chefs is still human. Some of the pieces will amaze you with chefs' creativity in the face of diaster (one chef, for example, stuck with a ruined wedding cake, calls in the dogs). Unfortunately, some of the pieces are just plain boring. In one, for example, the ""disaster"" is that the narrator gets yelled at for throwing away some onions. I'm sure it was painful to him, but it's just not that much fun to read. In total, I'm not sure the good parts of the book make it worth shelling out money for. I borrowed mine from the library."
4,"This is a quick, fun read!","Very enjoyable! The short, self-contained vignettes offer a nice way to spend a few minutes at the end of the day or some other quiet time. Some of the stories are better than others, but most are quite entertaining.Some notable entries: I laughed to the point of tears at Anthony Bourdain's contribution. I wanted to be in that kitchen with Jimmy Bradley, drunk and rowing to the Hawaii 5-0 theme. Also loved Heston Blumenthal, Hubert Keller, so many others. There were a few incidents that I, personally, would never have confessed - Mary Sue Millikin, Susan Feniger and Michel Richard - but that sure made for great reading.All in all, there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours than browsing through this book."
2,"Some cute stories, but HUGE grammar/spelling/formatting issues","Some of these stories are funny or at least mildly entertaining (particularly Anthony Bourdain's piece) but as another reviewer said, nobody bothered to edit it. AT ALL. There are an incredible number of typos, grammatical errors, and even entire paragraphs from chapters pasted haphazardly into other chapters. It made a book that could have been a pleasant light read extremely frustrating."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"This is the poorest job of editing that I've run across yet. Paragraphs were embedded within one another. Sentences were cut and pasted in the middle of other sentences. It is entirely unreadable. A shame, most of the essays would have been entertaining if they weren't so badly botched by the editor."
4,"On second thought, I will work as a waiter......","If you are a fan of Chopped, Top Chef, Iron Chef and other cable cooking TV shows, you should recognise the chef's in this book.Inside this book are 40 stories stories that range from funny to better you than me. It is nice to see some Chefs admit their follies and insecurities when they were younger.I really liked this book. The chapters are short:which is great when you dont have the time or you are too tired to deal with anything with a plot.Just fun short stories.Yes, there are some proofreading errors. I didnt think it was that bad. If you are a grammar nazi, then avoid this book. I can overlook the minor stuff and really, there are no real egregious errors....so open up and enjoy the world of ""WHEN WEDDING CAKE MEETS DOBERMANS"" and thank me later:)"
2,Not so hot,"Too bad, it seems like it could have been good. A good basic idea. A few chapters are good, most throw aways."
4,Worth more than I payed ... and good for me too,"Very good to watch! I am generally pretty happy with my body but it had crossed my mind that my A's were to small, and the problem with clothing not being made to fit my bust has always been a little frustrating. After having watched this video ... I'm comfortably happy and satisfied with my body. Go me! and go Breasts - A Documentary!I'm not sure what else they could have done to get a 100% review so in the end it is easily recommendable but it was just missing some-thing or other. Eh ..."
5,I was thrilled to find a credit card holder with good stiff material.,"After 25 years I needed a new credit card holder and purchased one at a stationary store. It was soft, flimsy material and difficult to put the credit card in or out. Now I have yours and it is great!"
5,Credit Card Holder,I really love this item. I have been looking for something to keep all our credit cards and other items in and this works so well. Also very easy to get the cards out.
4,Enchanting.,"Looking as if they've just stepped off the set of Sofia Coppola's ""Virgin Suicides"", ""Au Revoir Simone"" are three Slimcea girls who rejoice in Sunsilk hair and Laura Ashley frocks.The trio share keyboard duties and play them in the tentative manner of a young child reading Braille.Their songs have a twisted charm that's half cute and half disturbing and also strangely catchy.Occasionally, as on the wondrous sunshine pop of ""The Lucky One"" and ""Fallen Snow"", they hit on the kind of blissful marriage of pop, harmony and weirdness that worked so well for Polyphonic Spree.Elsewhere they excel in retro electro - kind of 60s MOR with a Casio beat.As a record, it's much more approachable than their debut album, ""Verses of Comfort, Assurance and Salvation"".You'll either fall in love with ""The Bird Of Music""or feel queasy - or quite possibly both."
1,Dissatisfied,"I didn NOT get the 16x20 size I ordered, I got a smaller size sent in a smaller round tube, not the rectangular tube the 16x20 comes in - This is the 2nd time I reported this with no response - Very unhappy!Claude DeMoss1699 Hamilton Ave #13San Jose, CA 95125408-677-4131"
1,"Don't Bother With Poor Quality Public Domain Episodes/Wait for Official Season Releases by CBS/Paramount Home Entertainment, Dec","Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing."
3,"""Little"" is the operative term","This is a nicely made item. However, a ""hunting knife"" it is not. Unless you are hunting squirrels or other similarly sized creatures, that is. Also, unlike the version reviewed by another person on this forum, the knife I got was made in Taiwan rather than in Olean, New York. I am going to keep it, as it will make a nice letter opener, but I cannot say that I am not somewhat disappointed by the actual, physical reality of what I bought."
2,OK but not the best,"Product is cheap, KA BAR is not what I thought it would be. I ordered this one and the Case knife that is comparible and recieved them in the same package. No kidding, felt like throwing the KABAR in the garbage compared to the Case."
3,Did it shrink during shipping or what?,"Received item today. My glee was soon turned to shock as I opened it and found what looked like a child size version of a hunting knife. It appears to be decently made, although it doesnt have the weight I would expect. Fortunately my wife has tiny hands and loves to fish so instead of my new hunting knife i guess this will be her new fishing knife. Really though, the blade is approximately the length of my middle finger and not as wide as my finger. Heads up."
2,WAY too small,"This thing is TINY. I didn't realize it would be smaller than my everyday carry pocketknife. This knife doesn't belong on your belt. It's more like the size of a typical ""neck knife,"" and in fact I have neck knives that are quite a bit bigger. This is also one of the dullest knives I've ever seen from Ka-Bar. It is at least a pretty knife, but on the whole a disappointment."
1,"Liar Liar, pants on fire . . . .","""Butt Cap/Guard: Aluminum/Brass; Hollow-Ground; Straight Point; Leather Handle; Stamp: Olean, NY""Liar, Liar pants on fire.

Shame on you.Shame on me for not checking the reviews as I see now that you have been advertising this wrong since 2009."
4,Calming,This is the kind of album for the cold rainy days in bed. A change from the load stuff we have today. Buy this and cuddle in bed.
4,Great selections of flute music,How could you not love James Galway? xxx xxx xx xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxxx xxx xxx xx x x
5,i love kodocha,"i love kodocha,its such a good book series/show.the plot is fantastic.there are alot more charectors in the show then the books ,its still my favorite show/books ever.i love 'em.miho is my hero.still the show is allot more confuseing to me then the books but you should be able to connect the dots.i would have never thought of anything close to as good as kodocha...I LOVE IT!!!"
4,SOME ADViCE,"If I were you guys, I would go and buy the japensese version, and read the english subtitles on ebay. That's what I did and plus its the whole set not just a part of it so you don't have to wait for it to come out"
5,Murder most Beastly,This book was funny and very unique. The author always keeps you in suspense of who done it until the very end of the book. She also gives an epilogue at the end of the mystrey. Jackie and Jake are a wonderful pair. You can't beat them as a sleuth team and for having a nose for murder.
4,"Fast, Fun, and Full O Software!","This is one nice scanner. It has connections for a parallel an USB ports. It comes with Paper Port, Photo Suite 3, and lots of other software. It has great resoulion too (up to 1200 dpi). But you need a fast computer. It says it needs a pentium 133 w/ 16 megs of ram, but I would recomend a celeron 466 or above w/ AT least 32 megs of ram. I have a Pentium 3, 700mhz with 128 megs of ram and it runs nice."
1,Three strikes you're out!,"When I first hooked this scanner up I had some problems, so I called for help. The assistant on the other line was rude, and seemed to be in a hurry. I have installed this scanner on my BRAND NEW computer, and oops, mouse slows down, commands slow down, everything slows down and doen't respond. I did a system restore. Installed the scanner again, same problem. Yes, you guessed it I tried a third time. That's it I am returning this product. How could a company sell a product like this. Also, another customer had mentioned that he had Windows ME (2000) and thought that maybe the CD wasn't compatable, I also thought this, but certainly a good company would have updated their software by now. Or let me know when I was on the phone, that some customers may experience system problems. Do not buy this product, don't let the low price fool you."
1,One Touch My Foot,"I first bought this product about a year ago for my Win98 system. It worked ok except the software never did reckognize my Outlook or fax software, even after several tech support attempts. As far a scanning quality, I was never impressed with the 8100.Recently I bought a P4 with Win2000. I installed the Visioneer software, but the driver would not install. I downloaded the updated driver that is supposed to support 2000, and still no luck. Have been trying everything their tech support has been telling me, but it looks like the local thrift shop is getting a scanner."
1,Visioneer Doesn't Play nice with WinXP,"I will never buy another Visioneer product. I bought a 7600. When it was less than two years old and still available at retail,I upgraded to XP. Guess which company has yet to upgrade PaperPort 6.0 (their proprietary software) for this scanner use with XP. They give you a rediculous clumsy workaround to install the drivers that has to be redone everytime you disconnect the scanner (that's fun when your're using a laptop!) Bad move Visioneer. You are the only major company that I'm aware of that didn't catch up with XP within 6-8 months or less."
1,POOR SUPPORT,"I do believe this unit is no longer covered under visioneers phone support. If you wish support you have to either fax or use a online q & a program named SARA. Phone support is a high fee based 900 number! Also if you have AOL 9.0 forget it. I've complained awhile back about my 8920 one touch not working anymore when I upgraded to AOL 9.0, they wouldnt offer free phone support on this model and when I finally got a fax through to them awhile back they said they would work on a AOL 9.0 fix, well they havent fixed it yet. So check with Visioneer first to see if they will support this machine and if it will work with AOL 9.0. Also my glass is fogging up on the inside. This apparently is a common problem. Im disappointed with Visioneer and will prob get an HP next time."
1,Not for non-tech people,"Purchased this scanner based on the reviews I read. Took it home, worked for two hours trying to get it to scan. Never happened. Too much set up required, too tedious. Don't recommend it if you have a deadline or are in a hurry."
5,A fascinating guide to American foods,"America's diversity of ingredients, foods, styles, and recipes is so very well documented in this guide. Reading this will make one want to visit every region of America to sample the delicacies. It's really more of an encyclopedia as there are numerous explanations of culinary techniques and facts about ingredients highligted by rich, colorful photography. Food and cooking enthusiasts of all levels will find this book informative and entertaining. The writing is excellent and very very readable. As one reviewer already stated, the biggest drawback is the book's weight. Frankly, it's worth the extra few pounds."
5,A Cook's Best Friend,"Although it was purchased as a gift, I scanned it extensively. Awesome. This one is going on my list next time! This is an excellent reference to have in a well stocked kitchen."
2,A virtual feast for the eyes!,"This is a beautiful book with its lovely color photography and interesting text about the various food interests of our country's many regions. I was disappointed, however, to find a number of errors in the book, primarily in relation to the pictures (e.g., a sequence of photographs not being in the correct order for their captions, a reference to Chicago being located on Lake Superior). As an avid collector of cookbooks (and a lifetime Chicagoan), I had a hard time getting past these errors, so I returned the book. Otherwise, it is an impressive book, in size and beauty."
4,The Best of P&G and More,"The tape in this four-volume set brings back memories. Most of the commercials in this volume includes ads for many Procter and Gamble products. For many years P&G has been the nation's largest advertiser, and many of the company's products(e.g.,Crest, Safeguard, Ivory Soap, Crisco, Scope, Bounty)are by far the nation's best selling brands, and they are revived successfully in this tape, which also has ads for Quisp cereal, Jell-O (advertised by the vocal group The Fifth Dimension), the 1969Plymouth (with a cartoon favorite, the Road Runner), and many more. Serious nostalgia buffs--especially those loyal to P&G products--will want this tape."
3,it works fine,"I think it may just be me, but i just always felt that my baby wasn't comfortable in any of these and i never knew what angle to put him in at to be comfortable and good on his spine. i used it some and gave it to my sister. She loves it and has used it a lot."
5,Genuine history,"This book is outstanding. It has been written with an objective unbiased perspective by a firsthand witness (Holocaust survivor). Though disturbing and difficult to read at times due to the horrifying nature of the subject matter, it is of significant historical importance. Strongly recommended."
4,Surprisingly affordable and quality,"I took a chance on this unit when I bought it from Costco about a year ago and am very satisified with it. I maily use it for making videotapes of my child's favorite TV show while he is in school and using the home theater for DVD movies and concert DVD's. I think you can make VHS tapes from a DVD, but why would you want to?? If you are looking for an inexpensive home theater setup, I recommened this one!"
3,Rules for Larps,"I found that the content was intriquing, but that the amount of fluff in the book was a bit overboard. The rules themselves have too many loopholes as well as contradicting eachother at times. The creativity was excellent and sparked the imagination to ponder new and interesting things."
3,a non-drug sleep aid that works fairly well.,"I've tried this brand and didn't find that it worked as well for me as the brand I use now. It does work for my daughter though, so it may be good for others as well. It's great to find a product that helps with sleep issues without the effects drugs can have."
4,Good for every one in awhile use,"I can't use this everyday. I only take it when I feel really pressured to perform the next day (interview, talking with people, having to appear out-going). If I use it everyday, the effect is lost. If I use it once a week at the most, I feel very on top of things and capable."
1,OMG Please be careful!!,"I took 50mg daily of 5-htp and I have to say, please be careful. I had such a terrible experience. I felt fine after taking it for the first day or so, I was sleeping better and my mood had improved. However, when any sort of stress was introduced, my reaction was 10x worse. I very quickly progressed from cheerful to sobbing in my room for 2 days. My doctor was even surprised by the reaction I had to it, so please, if you are considering taking it, be careful."
1,False Advertising,"This page (as of this writing) states 100mg bottle. We ordered this product and were surprised to receive only 50mg. Looking closely at the picture. It shows 50mg. The price was only slightly less than 100mg from other manufacturers. This listing is misleading. I would hope that they will update this page, and perhaps by the time you read this, they have."
1,Not for me,"I tried this (small dose, 50 mg at bedtime) for 2 nights. It made me strange, and wired. Did NOT sleep. The first night I took it on an empty stomach, and got heartburn. The second night, with milk, which was OK.Into the trash it goes. I tend to be very sensitive to everything..."
4,a better night's sleep,"Now 5-HTPI have found that I sleep best when I take two of these, i.e. 100 mg. Please be advised that 5-HTP can cause very vivid dreams which might be disturbing to some people. I don't mind them given the trade off, a better night's sleepRecommended for people who want an alternative to a prescription sleeping pill.NOW has a new product with L-Tyrosine that you might want to try. See [[ASIN:B00029F5G8 5-HTP with L-Tyrosine (200mg) 60 vcaps5-HTP with L-Tyrosine (200mg) 60 vcapsBe sure to consult with your medical doctor before talking this or any other supplementIt takes about a week for the 5-HTP to build up in your body, if you're not better after 5-7 days you might want to increase the dosageGunner July, 2009"
3,It's not for me,"It had adverse side effects on me. Instead of taking care of anxiety and helping me to sleep, it did just the opposite. I feel much better since I quit taking it. But don't be discouraged, you won't know unless you try it. Different people have different reactions to it. I have tried it few times over few years and every time (no matter what the brand was) I got the same side effects. From reading the reviews online, I understand that it is a great alternative to prescription meds for some people. My mom says that it helps her more than prescription anti-depressant."
4,Decent Vitamin for Price,"The 5HTP I purchased is decent. For the most part, it curbes cravings but does not eliminate them completely. I took a pill 30 min before each meal, 3 times a day. I didn't notice any major weight loss by just usuing the pill. I lost 1 lb a week by eating 1200-1400 calories and exercising for 20-30 min each day. The supplement helped keep my cravings in check for the most part but don't expect for the pills to work with diet and exercise. As for mood, I didn't see much of a difference."
4,Sticky,"This glue is very sticky and water resistant. I use it for general wood working and model airplanes (Balsa). It is a little thinner than Elmer's comparable glue. I am somewhat conflicted about that as in some cases I like the glue thinner and sometimes I like it thicker. Understand that as a water based glue, you can always make the thick glue thinner -- but that is work.But I think this glue is a little less expensive than the Elmer's comparable water proof glue.If it is less expensive, I think I may probably buy it again."
1,I hate this stuff.,"This is the first time I have used this glue and it doesn't work as expected. Now, maybe I got a bad batch or something but all this stuff seems to do is soak into the wood and hold nothing. I apply this glue and within a few minutes it is almost dry so then I apply another coat....and sometimes yet another coat....aggrevating, to say the least. After I let it dry I can still pull the glued objects apart with my hands. This is the first and last time I am buying this stuff; I'm sticking to the regular carpenters glue because it worked a lot better.....and it is also cheaper to buy. I do not recommended this product...in fact, I hate it!!"
5,Love it!,"Loved the poetry writing of this author. She speaks to the soul and reminds us how human we are. I would recommend this book particularly if you are from a small town or want to experience that flavor. She presents the hardships, life experiences as well as the successes of life which we can all relate to."
5,Excellent model,"This is a fabulous paper model- a life size, fully articulate skeleton made only with factory perfortated (so you don't have to worry about cutting it out!) light cardboard and (included) tacks to attach pieces to each other. It's amazingly detailed and life-like, and impressively sturdy. It's a fantastic alternative to expensive medical skeletons."
5,wow,"eckhart reads like a combination of an open-minded seeker-pope and a buddhist or taoist master. this book was a wild introduction for me to a very interesting thinker, unfortunately one mostly hidden among the jutting rocks of religious history."
3,$30.24 Recommended over the zipper type,I ordered the gallon zipper ziplock bags during the Hefty promotion before I watched the episode of America's Test Kitchen that tested freezer storage bags. The Glad bags came out on top but the ziplock bags with the zipper cuff were found to not properly seal the food from air. Aargh!I do not regret this bulk purchase at all as I have found many uses for them and they are sturdy enough to reuse.
5,Visit Korea via sublime photography,"Suh-Jai-sik is an artist in his own right. His photography skill is simply awesome, and his homeland, Korea, is a good colorful place to use the skill.192 pages, this book gives insight into Korea and it's people who live in pride and dignity on the beautiful land.The book consists of seven chapters with outstanding photography on each page: Seoul, Kyongiju and Puyo, Buddism, Cheju Island, Tradition and Folk Customs, Nature and Life, Preparing for the 21st Century."
4,a great work of the civil rights era,"Daisy Bates work is a very important document from the era of civil rights. Although it is not an actual account of one of the nine students who integrated Central High, it is very close. Bates was right there directing the operation, making sure the students were protected, and made sure that the children were encouraged to go ahead with their duty. I don't think I would have been able to send those kids in to that school, with all those hateful students. I hope Arkansas and the citizens of Little Rock apologize every day for what they did to those nine children."
4,She loved it,"I gave this mug to my mom for christmas and she loved it! My only complaint is the small hole in the bottom on the cat head which makes the cat head collect water in it whenever it goes through the dishwasher, but the water can be dumped out so it's okay! great mug, thanks"
4,Great for cat lovers,Had given the matching teapot for Christmas gift. I was very happy when the mug became available. It's really cute. My only complaint is that the shipping cost was as much as the cup...
5,sweetest haba doll house,"This is the cutest doll house. Perfect for storing and playing with your haba dolls. We are able to fit three haba dolls in it with no problems. The house is so colorful. The sleeping bag, pillow, and little chair are so cute. My daughter loves to sit in the little chair as well as sitting her dolls in it. It is a little pricey, but well worth it. Made really well, and will be one of those toys to pass down to the grandkids one day."
5,Great book for reunion planners!,"This is one of the best books on reunion planning, with lots of great information and ideas I never thought of before. Well worth the money!"
4,Value,bought these and am happy with the big grip. they feel safer than the kliens when cutting live wires. but for larger wires the kliens cut a bit more effortlessly. if they cut just a bit better than they do or had a fish tape grip on the side it would receive 5 stars.
1,Overhyped and inferior,"The tomato flavor is inferior, the taste is extremely acidic compared to others, and there is a weird, sweet-metallic aftertaste. Even a small amount taints everything it is used in with the odd aftertaste, which I assume comes from the packaging. I am throwing the remainder of the tube away and using a canned brand from now on. Even if I throw away half the can, it would be less expensive, and more edible. When compared to home-made tomato paste, or even cheap canned brands, this product simply doesn't measure up."
2,GET PLOT IDEA POORLY EXECUTED,"The idea was good, this could have been a good movie. But the plot was not well put together, the dialogue was often disjointed, and even the props were often incongruous. The acting ranged from so-so to poor. The character development disjointed. In short, other then some cute shots of dogs this movie just did not work."
4,Love dog movies,If you love dog movies you will love this one! Is isn't too far fetched. The story line reflects some of today's issues with dogs and cats being given up like an extra piece of furniture. This movie will warm your heart and hopefully make you think about a pet as more than just a cute entertainer or status possession. Not a deep movie but a nice one.
2,main actress can't act; slow plot,"The main actress who played Emma has a wooden expression when some expression is expected (e.g. when being yelled at). Plus she is not particularly cute or adorable. Poor casting choice.As to the plot and story line, it is slow. Shrinking this movie down to 1 hour would make it better. And the plot isn't particularly logical. E.g. a parent letting a female child travel on her own to stay with someone without prior agreement, and didn't even write or call to confirm her arrival.I keep expecting the movie to become more exciting but after watching half the movie, I had to view it at 60x until near the end. Even the finale is kind of lame.I guess this may be suitable for people who loves dogs and are not critical of its flaws."
1,Big disappointment,"One of the worst movies I've seen in years. The characters merely went through the motions like they were doing a ""walk-through"" rehearsal. The lead girl never even tried to act. Her expression never changed at all even when she should have been squealing. So bad!"
5,12 Dogs of CHRISTmas,"I gave this to My grand-neice, & She LUVs it,so what can I say; except it most be pretty GOOD."
5,Cute,"Very cute movie. I was unsure about ordering it with the mixed reviews, but it was cute, and I enjoyed it."
1,Beware-not for ALL kids,Beware if you have young children and think this is a family Christmas movie - there is a conversation in this movie regarding S.C. that is NOT appropriate for all audiences(and it was totally not needed for the storyline) IMO they should have included a warning on the packaging or a PG rating rather than G. Could have been a cute story if it weren't for the horrible writing/acting. I'd recommend skipping this one...
2,Yawn,"I was so disappointed in this movie. It was just boring.As other reviewers have pointed out, the girl who plays Emma has the same, consistent expression on her face--which is to say, NO expression regardless of whether she is being chased, yelled at, hugged, or thrown out of somewhere. She wasn't very believable.My kids liked it well enough but I doubt we'll be watching this one again."
1,Not so good,We were all excited we'd be getting a family movie with lots of dogs in it.It was very disappointing. Just no story. Not that many dog scenes either.
1,The 12 Dogs of Christmas,"Christmas time and a house full of ""Young Children"" quickly looking for new Movies when we saw ""The 12 Dogs of Christmas"" DVD. We liked the cover and scanned a few customer reviews not all and then ordered it just before dinner--this was a MAJOR MISTAKE!Luckily we preview all Movies before the Children get to see them-""The 12 Dogs of Christmas""-- was AWFUL, even DISTURBING for some of the Adults. We all feel that this is NOT a Movie for ""Young Children."" We wasted $14.98 but thank goodness, we found some Great Movies for FREE at our Public Library that the Children loved! Do yourself a favor and PASS ON THIS MOVIE!"
1,Political Work,The author shares many of his political opinions that would be more approperiate on an Op Ed page rather than a text book.
2,tisk tisk tisk,"Hello Rockview is my favorite album ever! The songs, from Losers and Kings to Hello Rockview have been unique and inpsiring. Borders, Anthem, and B is for B sides were alright albums because they mixed a few great songs with a lot of bland ones. It seems like ""In with the Out Crowd"" is made up of all bland songs. Not to quote Vinnie himself, but he seems a bit too formulaic on this album.What happened to them? Were they the brightest bulb that burned out?It seems so on this latest album."
1,Goodbye LTJ?,"I have been a fan of Less Than Jake since Hello Rockview, and I stood by them even though I thought Anthem was a mediocre album. However, now I'm afraid that this new cd marks the end of a great band; they seem to want to be sold over to the Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and Panic at the Disco crowds. Goodbye true punk people, hello poppy wannabes... Even as an old fan, I couldn't manage to make it through the whole cd (I made it through track 9). At one time it was Goodbye Blue and White, but now it's Goodbye LTJ."
2,hello suckview,"I've been a less than jake fan since hello rockview. I think this album is slightly worse than Anthem. I wasn't overall pleased with anthem, but there are 4 good songs on there that I listen to regularly (Welcome to the New South, Short Fuse Burning, Plastic Cup Politics, and Look What Happened[even though the original is still better]). Those anthems are solid and hard rocking. This album on the other hand does not seem to have any standout songs. It just seems watered down with lame choruses and less energy than anthem. Although I don't particularly like this CD so far, it is Less Than Jake, and I will listen to it until I like it."
2,IWTOC: A far cry from LTJ,"I am not happy to say that this is the most dissapointing album I have ever bought from less than jake, the music on this album is NOT ska-punk, and the 3 songs that actually have Buddy and JR in them are barely enough to qualify. The energy that used to fuel all their best songs is just gone. They call the album ""In with the out crowd"", but the music is just so mainstream that the name contradicts the album. I have been listening to them for 5 years and they are my favorite band, but im having second thoughts. They're basically dumping all of their real fans and selling out to the emo crowd, and writing all of their song lyrics as if they were about to die. If you need a comparison go listen to Losing Sreak, and then this. I feel like they have betrayed the fans who have been with them all this time."
4,Best Album Yet,"This is, by far, Less Than Jakes best album Since 'Losing Streak'. The albums released between 'Losing Streak' and 'In With the Out Crowd' were, dare I say, boring. Every song on this album has a different sound, but, at the same time, Less Than Jake manages to stay true to their ska roots. Bravo LTJ!"
2,Puh-leze,"Less Than Jake have NEVER put out a record I could listen to from start to finish. Usually, we get about 4 fillers, 4 average songs, and 4 killer songs per record. The closest thing to a perfect LTJ record came in the form of B is for B-sides, which had only 2 or 3 fillers, and the rest of the songs were awesome. 'In with the out crowd', though, is by far their worst to date. I actually like 'borders and boundries' better, and I pretty much hated that cd too. Don't expect anything like ""scott farcus"" or ""bridge and tunnel"" on IWTOC, there are NO stand-outs here. Now I know why I never really got into LTJ. They just can't write a good record from start to finish."
2,My least fav release by Less Than Jake,"I'm sorry, but In With the Out Crowd just doesn't have that signature Less Than Jake sound we all know and love. LTJ are just too good at their sound to pretty much just completely abandon it. It's there in a couple of songs, but for the most part, they gave in to the sound that was popular at that time. When listening to LTJ albums, I almost always skip this one. It has some bright spots, but not enough to salvage the album for me. I'm glad they went back to the LTJ we love with GNV FLA. Hope to see and hear another album soon!"
3,STrange people,"That guy talking about everything sucks cause there is not enough Horns..I love Less than Jake but I hate ""ska"" Its stupid, LTJ dont want to be SKA... I don't think you even understand what ""ska"" is? Well I don't either since its just another stupid made up word for bands that have a horn in their songs.. For instance Operation Ivy is not a 'SKA"" BAND.. tHEY ARE A pUNK rOCK band.. Less than jake do not care if they are a ""ska"" band and they do not want to be a ""ska"" band... Horns have no place in rock in roll anyways but they are cool when its here and there but every song gets annoying..AT the end of the day LTJ and all these Punk or Ska bands are 1 thing: A ROCK N ROLL BAND!SO dont get all consumed with titles, who cares anyways.. I like the pop punky stuff with catchy songs , I like to know whats going on in the music.You are right about one thing though Good Charlotte do suck I actually forgot all about them till you said their name and I prefer to forget again..Thank You"
3,"Not bad, not good....","Less Than Jake used to be an amazing ska band. Now they are trying to change there image and play more of a generic punk sound. If you like songs 1 and 3 you probably are part of the new crowd they have been attracting. Not that those songs are to bad but when I listen to LTJ I want to listen to ska, they sound more like Mest, Allister or Gob with horns on this cd. All in all it's a pretty decent cd but if I want some good ska I have to go to Big D and the Kids Table or Catch 22. If you're looking for a good ska cd by LTJ do yourself a favor and skip out on this one and go buy Hello Rockview or Losing Streak."
2,Pretty poor effort by LTJ,"Of course LTJ can't really put out a ""bad"" album, but this...I dunno, I just find it very boring. The only songs I truly can listen to over and over again are #1 and #3. It's not so much because they're alot poppier (Anthem was very light on the ska but I still loved that disc) but the songs just don't have the same feel anymore. Buy it if you're a big LTJ fan, a couple of the songs won't disappoint you."
3,worth a listen,"First of all, if you are trying to get into Less Than Jake, do not buy this cd. start with Hello Rockview, Borders and Boundaries, or Losing Streak.If you've been listening to LTJ forever: The cd isn't blatantly bad. Actually, it's not bad at all. But it definitely does not have the same sound and the same energy as their older stuff. In With The Out Crowd is much more trite and mainstream. So if you're a fan, while you might be a bit dissapointed with this album, it's definitely worth a listen."
2,I've heard better....,"I am a huge fan of Less Than Jake, have all their albums and everything. This one, however, is not their best (border-line disappointed). #1 What happened to the horns? Pretty much the only two songs I like on the CD are the ones with horns in it. I know a lot of people are saying that we should embrace the fact that they are venturing away from their traditionally ska background and experimenting with more of a pop/rock sound, but it's that ska sound that has kept me hooked in the first place. If you are looking for the usual LTJ masterpiece, this is not the one for you. If you are interested in something more like The Starting Line/The Ataris with the personality of LTJ, then you may like this."
1,The loss of all things sacred...,"this album is terrible. theres only maybe one good song on the whole thing. its very disappointing because i have been a huge LTJ fan for a long long time (since ""Losing Streak""), and i have recognized a steady decline in the quality of their music since they released ""anthem"" in 2003.""In With The Out Crowd"" is poppy neo-trash which will fit in well with New Found Glory and the new generation of Green Day fans.""Borders and Boundaries"" was the last GREAT Less Than Jake album. its sad."
3,more horns,"When I first bought in with the out crowd I was very dissapointed. It is nothing like Losing Streak. It's a pretty good cd, but it's not less than jake. There is way to much guitar and not enough horns."
1,"Vinnie, What were you thinking?",Am I listening for a poppier Bowling for Soup??? I think Johnny Quest was right but a decade pre-mature when he called you sellouts.
