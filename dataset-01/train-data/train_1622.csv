3,it will do the job,the face of the watch was a lot smaller than we expected it to be and it was strange that the holes went almost all the way up to the face but it's an okay watch and it will do the job for what we needed it to do.
5,From HaShem's Book of Happiness,"In a time when most authors encourage readers to concentrate on themselves in the quest for happiness and fulfillment, Rebbetzin Jungreis pulls timeless truths from the Torah and from the writings of Rabbis and other wise people. This pithy and positive life view from a woman who spent much of her tender years in a concentration camp brims over with the true joy and true contentment of putting others' needs first, out of obedience and love for the Almighty. In addition, Rebbetzin Jungreis quotes accurately and in full from her sources--she has too much respect and love for both sources and readers to do otherwise.Depressed? Broken-hearted? Afraid? Feeling as if nothing matters? Get a life! A committed life, that is.Highly recommended."
5,Excellent,"I don't think the reader from LA ""gets it"". That's just the point! Rebbetzein Jungreis is touching on the basics of life without all the outer wrappings. One has to be able to break through all the unimportant and often phony things that hide the real us. Only if we are willing to accept that idea as truth, can we accept and appreciate all the ideas set forth in this book. The stories are real life stories that help us understand these ideas in real life context. They are what makes all the theoretical ideas real."
5,spiritually uplifting,"Best book ever! recommend to everyone. It is so spiritually uplifting, you wont want to put it down. you will really enjoy her ancedotes, they get her points across so clearly and cleverly. I am read all her books because this one was so good!"
5,The Rebbetzin is a treasure for all to share,This book is a work of art. People from all races and religious backgrounds can learn real lessons of humanity from this extraordinary work. It's amazing how EVERY incident that happens in our everyday life can be diagnosed and reflected upon within the Torah. The Rebbetzin is a brilliant writer and public speaker. Read her books and pass them on to others!
1,Very disappointing.,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is a trite and self-serving memoir. While the themes contained in it are worthwhile-- indeed, some of the quotes in the chapter headings are interesting and I wish there had been more discussion of them, rather than lengthy descriptions of the author's accomplishments-- the book it is written in a very condescending and conceited tone. It is not intellectually stimulating."
4,Contemporary arrangements,"Well, at least these arrangements are by the original artist. However, the original was always great. Why try to improve on them. There are no vocals on these pieces which adds a great dimension to them.Richard Carpenter is a very talented pianists, composer and arranger. I believe this CD is worth buying, especially by the biggest Carpenters fans."
2,Richard Without Karen is Empty,"There is no doubt that Richard Carpenter is an exceptionally talented pianist, composer, and performer; however, without the pure vocals of sister Karen Carpenter, this collection of instrumental Carpenter songs falls flat. It's like having ice tea without the sugar, or Coca-Cola without the fizz - you know something vital is missing. In this case what is missing is Karen's exceptional voice. As a fan of the Carpenters for over 30 years, I of course knew all the songs on this collection, and they are excellent melodies, but I kept expecting to hear Karen's voice break in, the voice that makes these songs complete.I love the Carpenters, but without Karen's vocals, this collection reminds me of ""elevator music"".Die hard Carpenter fans will want this album to compete their collection, but if you are new to Carpenter music, I'd suggest you buy one of their greatest hits collections instead.Jim Konedog Koenig"
2,Superior Elevator Music,"While this CD may not break any ground musically for Richard, it is superior elevator music. The songs are well arranged, but every song makes you long for Karen's voice to somewhere magically appear on the album. Her drumming is evident on a couple songs, and her voice is mixed in with the OK Chorale on ""Sandy"", but she's still not there. Richard would be better off putting out unreleased Carpenters material or doing completely new music. This album is nice to play in the office or in the background - but it is not much more than that."
2,Getting Outdated,"14th edition (January 1999) is now 5 years old, so this book is woefully out of date for anyone looking for streets added or changed in the last SIX years (assuming that when a book comes out, it already a year out of date). Hey ADC, how about a new edition!!"
5,Grrrrrreat!,"I loved Cathryn's first Grrl Genius book and her second book is just as hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing from the first page.She makes the world of dating and finding true love seem almost fun! (Chocolate still wins out though!)Kudos Cathryn!Debbie Farmer, author 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat!'"
4,A Bit different for the usual,I wasn't sure about this purchase but I'm happy I got it. I loved the female lead and thought she had spunk. The male lead was a bit likeable as well. I would recommend for a quick read.
1,Indecent Deception by Lynne Graham,"This is the first time I am writing a review of a book; the reason is because I disliked it! This book was really really terrible. The hero Blaze is a JERK! Chrissy has spunk for standup to Blaze. From the beginning of the book where Chrissy overhears Blaze gossiping about her family I knew he was a jerk and was going to remain a jerk to the end of the book. Blaze wanted revenge on Chrissy's father and sister and used Chrissy to do it by hiring her. Blaze character was never redeemed, you never really found out what his hidden agenda was. Like, was he attracted to Chrissy when she was younger and what was his reason for hiring Chrissy. The book was one sided only revealing Chrissy's thoughts and her past. The book's ending was also rushed. What a disappointment! I love Ms. Graham book but hey can I get my money back!"
5,The men who have a FANTASTIC live DVD/documentary,"This DVD recreates the Travis concert experience *perfectly*. Even my dad(who's 63 years old and who has seen Travis in concert )thinks so.It's got all of the band's best songs. I like the fact that this particular concert covers all 3 of the band's album so far.(The second song in on the concert is ""U16 Girls"", from ""Good Feeling"", the band's first album.And there are plenty of songs from ""The Man Who"" and ""The Invisible Band"" to keep fans happy.I LOVE Fran Healy's between song banter(one of the best things about seeing Travis in concert).The documentary, directed by a friend of the band's, is a lot of fun(and very quotable).It's getting to see a side of Travis that most people do not get to see unless they are close to the band."
4,A Great Concert Souvenir,"For those fortunate enough to have caught on to Travis by the time of the Scottish band's ""Invisible Band,"" tour and saw them live, this concert DVD is a treat. Travis sounds musically tight and confident here. The band's presentation of its music evokes comparisons with an up and coming U2, with the songs and the band's on-stage delivery captivating the raucous audiences at the filmed concerts. I caught Travis at a small venue in San Diego during October 2001 and it was amazing to see how comfortable the band was playing the larger open air ""festival"" which was filmed just a few months prior to my seeing them. The DVD isn't without a minor, but annoying technical flaw. If you want to do the ""concert only"" option, the DVD doesn't start precisely at the beginning of the concert and misses about half a second of ""Sing"" in the process."
4,Not new this year,"Guide is good, but the contention from the seller as new is not accurate.Maybe the guide should be stated as new in 2002 and never used."
5,Very informative on Bill W,"I used this book to help with a essay on someone who has contributed to the counseling profession. Obviously I chose Bill W for his contribution of Alcoholics Anonymous. I wasn't very familiar with the structure of the organization but it was extremely helpful to read how it was started. The background information in this book on Bill W. is very thorough. I like the fact that it shares the good, the bad, and the ugly. Cheever is not afraid to give a full spectrum of Bill W.'s personality,activities, contributions, and mistakes. I found this book to be more helpful than the class' textbooks and videos. It was a very interesting read and I would recommend the book to addicts so that they understand Bill W.'s reasoning and to those who are in the substance abuse career field for clarification of the organization's purpose."
3,Not much new here...,"While Susan Cheever makes a valiant effort to use imagery and some carefully styled first person musings of Emily and Bill Wilson, her efforts fall somewaht flat. On the balance, this is essentially a retelling of ""Pass It On."" There are a few details at the end regarding Bill W.'s sexual compulsions that are common AA lore, and have appeared elsewhere.For those interested in the history of AA, this won't offer much in the way of insight into the early days of AA and how the program worked. Entertaining at points, but difficult to read attenteively if you have already read other accounts of Bill Wilson's life.Cheever's artistic touches didn't do much for me. I would rather she had put additional effort into her research, and brought a fresh telling with some new facts or insights.A completist must have. For the rest...optional."
5,love this book!,this book is an autobiography of one of the co-founders of AA! very exciting and interesting! recommend highly for anyone interested in AA!
2,Biil deserves better than this.,"As others have pointed, out this not a well researched biography. There is little here that was new to me except the material about Bill's last days and his extramarital affairs. Cheever's writing is clumsy and condescending, as if she were writing for early teens. How could it be otherwise given her failure to master essential source materials?"
3,"More than Mediocre, Less than Great","Guilty starts off Matthew Ryan's music career on an auspicious yet great start. The song gives Ryan instant crediblity as a great lyricist and songwriter. The next song, Watch Your Step, is a slight step down from Guilty's contagious rhythym and songwriting prowess. The big problem with Matthew Ryan at this stage in his career is that his folk rock feel tends to wallow in the folkiness more than balancing out the rock. When he does get the balance in songs like Guilty, Watch Your Step, Railroaded, and Comfort, there is not one modern day songwriter who can stand next to Ryan. His lyrics never touch the absurd, are never insincere, and his voice is so raspy that feeling cries out in his songs. However, songs like Irrelevent, Lights of the Commodre Barry, and Certainly Never are more likely to put the listener in a coma than to make them think about what they're hearing. Still, Ryan is very impressive and worth a listen, if nothing else for Guilty."
5,Incomparable,"Looking for something refreshing to listen to, I chanced upon this 1997 album in Towers Record in Singapore. I've never heard of Matthew Ryan. Looking at the cover and the song titles, I kind of guessed that this is no album by an ex-boy band member. The album blew me away. I could hear shades of Waits, Springsteen, perhaps Steve Earle. I could not stop raving about the album. I would put this album on a par with the best work by these great singer-songwriters. Best tracks: Irrelevant, Chrome. Not a dud track on the whole CD."
4,Update to a previous review,"A few extras I forgot to note in my original review.One page 123, where the book starts to talk about 88 level data items (Condition Names), it's time to go find a different reference. Any other reference. This book botches the explanation. I had trouble with it, the friend I mentioned had trouble with it (and I did not warn him about it in advance). It's the only major problem with the book.This book has not been revised since initial publication, and contains no information on the 1989 Addendum to the COBOL Standard (which is mostly Intrinsic Functions), and no information looking at the upcoming release of the new COBOL Standard."
1,you've got to be kidding me,"I started reading the book and initially enjoyed it. However, Sachar quickly displays her ignorance, racism and how incredibly self-involved she is. She claims that before she started teaching she read up on teaching subjects - yet when she gets in the classroom she is surprised at how inept she is and chooses not to apply any techniques (discipline, etc.). She also claims to be an education reporter, which left me wondering how she knew absolutely nothing about what she was getting into.If I had been a teacher with her, I wouldn't have trusted her either. She wasn't a teacher. She was merely a reporter writing a book. I searched for some kind of sign that she had contributed some of the profits from the book to the school. but no.So at the end of the day, she was just an ignorant, oblivious, opportunistic woman who truly made a difference in people's lives - a negative one. Don't read it - it will just frustrate you."

1,planet earth as seen from outer space,"Anyone blessed with the ability to instantly recognize land shapes from space should find this dvd fascinating. Unfortunately there is no commentary, only music, so the whole dvd had me guessing what part of the world I was viewing.Even just a sub title of what the viewer was looking at would have improved the enjoyment of the dvd 1000%.Anyone who can give me a run down of the images from start to finish will earn my gratitude."
1,Wire cable sent wrong color,I ordered a roll of RED wire and BLACK wire and you sent me one roll of BLACK wire then it took forever to get 2nd roll which was SUPPOSE to be RED and you sent another Black Roll of wire. NOW I HAVE 2 ROLLS OF BLACK THAT i AM SUPPOSE TO SEGREGATE positive AND negative WITH. sMOOTH mOVE exlax!!!!
3,"A good band with a good future, but needs a little work",Cold has a good first cd that will get better with time. I think that their second cd if there is one will be a lot better.
3,Cold are what you get when Bush mixes with metallic fuzz.,"Cold are nothing special, but they do have a couple of gems in their debut album that really do stand out. Aside from that their vocalist eerily sounds like Bush's Gavin Rossdale and the music is just your basic heavy metallic rock. A not bad album, but originality and more variation would make this album stand out a bit more."
5,Great cd!,"This is Cold's 1st cd! Back when they werent big time!""Strip Her Down"" is my fav. song on the cd!If your a COLD fan, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!"
5,A pretty good debut,"A lot of people are bashing this album. It is a quite decent debut. If you see how Cold has grown to what they are today, you gotta say that they are a great band. This debut album by all means isn't their best work. Scooter's lyrics are very sullen and gloomy, but thats how the album is. This album plays to the emotionally strained people. It helps many people cope with their feelings of depression. The production on this album isn't the greatest, but it is a clear strong debut. Sam's drum beats on this album are with out question top notch. If you are a Cold fan like I am or if you just like Rock, you would purchase this album. It has a plethora of tunes, ranging from hard metal riffs to slow acoustic solos. Definitely worth the 11 bucks."
4,"Not the best from Cold, but a good debut.","This is not my favorite from Cold, but thats not a bad thing since all of their albums are great. This is still a good debut, and it earns a solid four stars. I would reccomend buying '13 Ways to Bleed on Stage' first though and then 'Year of the Spider' and than this. Each Cold cd has their own sound. This is the heaviest Cold album. Its not hardcore like a death metal album, but its still hard. There are accustic songs on here too like 'Strip Her Down'. Some of the lyrics are sad and depressing. They are also angry. Another thing on the accustic songs. I dont like them as much as the none accustic songs, but they are still decent and not bad. Give em' a listen. I think that this is a pretty good cd. Its not the best Cold album, but still a good album."
4,Dark album for dark souls,"I'm usually more into technical chaotic stuff like death and black metal and I really have a strong hate for the mindless ""music"" of KoRnY, Gimp Bizquick, and Kid Rock and the pontificate attitudes that go along with it. BUT I must give Fred Durst some credit though, he does at least know some good music when he hears it, the signing of Cold is proof of this. This music isn't the most technical you'll ever hear, but they sure can hold their own on their instruments. Scoot Ward's lyrics do get a bit repetitious, but also have a disturbing quality that I find very appealing. Every song on this album is very passionate in a paranoid and depressing kind of way. There have been many nights that I've spent in the dark listening to this album. Definitely not recommended for happy people. If you like Radiohead's ""O.K. Computer"" or Staind's ""Dysfunction"", this album will probably sit well in your cd collection."
5,This one kickin' CD,"When I first heard this band on 120 Minutes one night I loved the song they played, then I borrowed the CD from a friend of mine and listened to the album in length, it was by far one of the most melodoically pleasing set of tracks I have ever heard. And the good thing is they balance all the mellowness with heavy riffs that just come out of no where. I strongly suggest the purchase of this CD."
4,excellent debut,"this is an excellent album, i especially liked ""give"", ""ugly"", and ""goodbye creul world"". the production values are low so it has kind of an underground grunge rock sound, wich is good if you like that kind of stuff.4.5 stars"
4,Raw grunge that rocks,"If you like your grunge music raw and emotional, then you need to buy this CD. I actually like it better than 13 Ways to Bleed Onstage because it has more of a raw, agressive feel to it, like you're in some garage listening to Cold rock out. I don't think 13 Ways captures that element as well. Although they can sound pathetic at times, these guys still sound better than Staind, Nirvana, and all those other grunge bands that got waaay too popular. If you enjoy this sort of music, then you'd probably like Failure and Neutral Milk Hotel (for acoustic stuff). Actually, those bands are a lot better than Cold, but who cares? These guys still can rock."
2,Come dance with me,"I purchased this CD just for the title song. The rest of the CD was not bad but not as memorable as the title song. I'm a line dancer and loved the dance that goes with ""Come Dance With Me""."
3,Science Experiments Ages 9 - 12,"Science experiments to be done at home. Over 300 are provided in a small book. The book would be better conceived and better presented if there were fewer experiments with more detail and more selectivity on each one. The target ages are 9 - 12 with parental supervision.Some of the science experiments included in the book are:1. A nail magnet - need insulated copper wire, a large nail, paper clips and a 6 volt dry cell.2. plant force - need pots, dirt, lima bean seeds and 3 different weights up to the weight of a half dollar.3. Ink eradicator - need lemon juice and household laundry bleach."
5,"Good cable, great price, well-known manufacturer","I'm very happy with this cable, it works exactly as it should. It's from a well-known, long-standing manufacturer (Belkin), I've used many of their products, and this cable was available at a great price, I'm very happy with it."
4,Fun and Thoughtful,"I'm a big Bryan Adams fan, but this is the first time I've bought his music. None of the songs I knew were on this CD, but I like just about everything."
3,Not so good !,"The sound quality of this albulm is good, but the selection of songs is not good. If you are looking for more powerful performance, buy the Live ! Live ! albulm !"
3,So So Live CD,I saw Bryan Adams last year live ... kind of an accoustical event. Amazing! I tried this CD to see how similar it is. It's so so.
5,great versions,"I bought this cd 2 days after seeing his concert and i really enjoyed it. The summer of 69 is really good cuz its not as upbeat as the original, and i like the acoustic sound. Also, the musicians in the background are amazing, its a great cd, but i would also suggest buying his other cds to get the full rock sound, but great cd."
4,Music That Stands The Test Of Time!,"Many people dismissed Bryan Adams in the mid-1980s as a fist-pumping Springsteen clone, and this was a highly unfair assesment of both men's work. Hearing Adams slow down ""Fits Ya Good,"" from 1981's You Want It, You Got It, made me listen to that CD again with renewed appreciation. And the versions of ""I Think About You,"" ""18 'Till I Die"" and (Especially!) ""I'll Always Be Right Here"" absolutely outdo the originals! One of the best MTV live performance available, and well worth the cost of admission!"
4,Bryan has really a good rock attitude even if unplugged,"Bryan isn't a fool and he hasn't only made one more MTV-unplugged album because it can't be compared with the others ( Clapton, Nirvana... ). It's really a Bryan Adams ' album ( even one of my favourite );each song seems to have been written in an unplugged way which isn't the case but it shows that these one are good songs. Bryan plays them in a real new way which sounds natural and very emotionnal"
4,proven talent,"love him or hate him, you can't deny Adams' talent after listening to this album. the quality of his songs, his eventual legacy, is proven by the transition to the unplugged format. no need to categorize this one as a guilty pleasure; call it what it is: good music"
5,An engaging account of India's culture and spiritual legacy.,"This book must surely figure among the classics written on India. The merit of a book written on a country can be gauged by the interest it generates in its readers for that country. Having lived outside India for a few years and having read many books on India, I can faithfully say that no other book transported my spirit closer to home than ""India Unveiled"". Robert Arnett understands that India's wealth lies more in her spiritual knowledge than in her material riches. Breathtaking photographs add great expression to the author's vivid commentary. The book is highly recommended for anyone interested in India's cultural values and also for those who plan on a visit."
2,"Not Real India, Not Whole India","I was very disappointed in the otherwise colorful book because it did not address the real India nor it shows the whole India. In fact, without discussing substance, the book has left out the entrire North East India comprising the seven states, namely the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram & Tripura, the so called the Seven Sisters which is physically the most beautiful and culturally most colorful part of India. So I would suggest that when Mr. Robert Arnett visits India next time, he would kindly take the time to visit the Seven Sisters and unveil the beautiful North East India and complete the book showing more real stuff in India."
4,Look out for ya'self,"For the most part, this is two disc set of progressive disco house. When I first made the purchase I listened to both sets completely. I'll be honest, Track 1 on the first cd (Emerson's set) has been ultimately set to repeat in my brain! This track has become my ""backing out the garage and rolling to work"" theme. Just a very good vibe to start the 2 disc set. So if you get this for anything, get it for track 1 called ""Ya'self"". I give it another week and it will be in my ""Top 25"" on my iPod!"
3,Looks So Easy,"When I found out that the dog trainer is a Mr. Weatherwax, I knew I had to buy this. I've read and used Rudd Weatherwax'sThe Lassie method;: Raising & training your dog with patience, firmness & love,and it's helped my dog and I so much.(Rudd Weatherwax is the owner and great, accomplished trainer of Lassie and many dogs used in many classic films.)In this video, Bob (Rudd's son) shows several commands and makes it look sooo easy, but then again Lassie, an already well trained dog is doing the tricks. This may be better if they used an untrained dog and showed him learning the tricks. Of course I'm glad Lassie's in the video too but maybe he could have just assisted, playing a guest starring role or something.But I'm glad this video exists, it's so much better than any other video on teaching a dog advanced tricks than anything else out there (and I've been looking).Maybe Mr. Weatherwax will do another? In dvd format?"
1,wrong product,"I thought I was getting the shear not just the attachments. What good does the attachment do without the shear? Why do we even sell it this way without clearly and plainly saying attachment only , shear not incluned? We already have 2 of them and never had any issues with the attachments. When I discovered I misunderstood what I ordered I tried to get in contact with the people I bought from but got no response."
1,Big disappointment,"I have been a devoted fan of Mr Caputo since I read The Voyage years ago.... one of my all time favorite books. I've since read most of his other work and much of it has been excellent. Rumor of War, Acts of Faith, Crossers, Means of Escape. But this one was a real disappointment. A truly disjointed and haphazard work. It was so utterly boring at times I found myself frequently flipping ahead several pages to try to find some reason to stay with it. Initially I thought it felt like a rough draft of something - unfinished - but now I'm struggling to think of any redeeming qualities at all. The main character, Starkmann, is so pathetic - and not just after his tour in Vietnam either. Right from the start the guy is such a hopeless dolt. How Caputo thought he could hang an entire novel around this dullard is beyond me."
2,Indian Country review,"As a VN era vet I was truly disappointed in this book. It did not compare with ""A Rumor of War""."
1,Overpriced Junk,"I bought two of these watches (partly due to my interest in steampunk), one for my blind friend, and one for myself. I haven't asked my friend how well his is working out, but mine was never bashed, banged, dropped, etc.After a few weeks, I realized that it doesn't keep time very well at all, and the digital part, failed entirely. I haven't gotten around to complaining to the seller about it, yet, because it upsets me every time I think about it. I'll have to spend at least $150 to replace it with a quality timepiece, but at least I'll have peace of mind.I just noticed, Amazon suggests ""full metal alchemist"" as a tag. It isn't this watch, and it's only a toy for children. Weird."
5,Better than an eposide!,This book came over just like watching a great eposide. It has Scully and Mulder at their best.
5,"EXCELLENT, the most thrilling X-file novel I have read","this book was the bomb, the 1st of the X-file novels I have read and now I am hooked for life. Please if you are looking to read a book choose this one EXCELLENT book."
5,great suspensful page turner,"this is the first xfiles book i have read, and I am glad I read it. It is a very very good suspensful page turner, and worth the read. I couldn't put it down"
4,Another Kevin J. Anderson Great!,"Anderson's latest tale of human meandering is par for the course. I flew through this book, enjoying all of it."
3,Antibodies is familiar fun for fans.,"When DyMar Laboratories is destroyed by protestors, no one gives it much thought. But when the security guard at the wreck site dies from a sudden infestation of tumors it becomes an X-File.Antibodies trots out a familiar sci-fi standard, the infected victim. In this case the man is infected with nanorobots that can kill a human in minutes, and completely dismantle the world in hours. That is if they get the chance to mutate. Apparently only an assassinated scientist's pet dog holds the key to a cure. Kevin J. Anderson's third (and looking to be final) X-File novel recycles concepts used in Dean Koontz's novel Midnight as well as Greg Bear's classic Blood Music (of which Anderson injects a sly reference to). End result? An entertaing weekend diversion that won't strain your brain. Recommended."
5,"For any fan of the TV show, X-Files novels are a must-read!!","I enjoyed reading Antibodies, part of the X-Files series. As a huge fan of the show, I wasn't too sure if the novels could convey the same intrigue and suspense. However, the book exceeded my expectations, and I can't wait to read them all. Now all they need to do is make it into an episode..."
1,Hackwork galore,"This book is awful. No doubt it will appeal to some (there's no accounting for taste), but at the core of it, the plot is weak, the writing mediocre and the characterizations untrue."
4,A message from the authors,"we the authors hope you enjoy and benefit from reading this book. We will continue monitoring messages in this location and are happy to answer any questions.We would have selected no stars above, however that option was not available."
5,Wonderful Work of Art,"This is a wonderful book. It is truly a work of art, any fan, especially collectors will love the beautiful pictures, inserts, letters and cards contained inside the book. The author did a wonderful job. You can tell that this book was written and put together with love, pride and devotion."
2,Disappointed,"I was fairly disappointed with this disc. Having visited Everglades National Park many times, I feel that it failed to capture the real beauty of the park. The presentation also contained errors such as showing images of a Tri-colored Heron, when talking about the Great Blue Heron, images of a Snowy Egret when taking about the Great White Heron, and an image of a Red-bellied Woodpecker, when talking about the Downy Woodpecker. These types of errors occur throughout the disc. It seems like the narration was recorded without regard for the video. Video quality is also not the best. The image lacks dynamic range and saturation as does the audio."
3,The Everglades,"The documentary is very good. It just buying. It's a good movie to collect.The film with no pretensions. Soft and good for relaxing.The images are beautiful, the soundtrack good. It's a good movie.The only problem is that there is no legend in Portuguese and Spanish."
5,WOW,BREATHE TAKEN IT WAS LIKE BEING THEIR AND IN THE BLU-RAY FORMAT IT WAS SO REAL.IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TRIP THERE IN PERSON.
2,"Burns hot, but not for too long","It is what it is. Small, convenient, hot(at 1300C it's hot enough to melt most coins), and it's neat. What it isn't, though, is tough. I put it in my glove compartment while heading into some rural land with bad roads, and it broke from bouncing around in there. I just wish I got to use it more."
1,NOT what is advertised,Big time misrepresentation - this item is all wood - there is no ceramic surface anywhere. Not only that but it cannot be used as a food or drink tray without a protective covering. The painted design is simply ok. The certification that it is a Portmeirion Studio is a sticker on the bottom of the tray. I would not have purchased this item if I had seen it in person.
3,Very good in small amounts,"This tea is delicious, but it is definitely a 'dessert' kind of tea. More than one cup in a sitting might be a bit too cloying for a lot of people. I brewed mine a bit less than they suggested, and it was still pretty strong."
2,Difficult heels,I own a lot of heels and these are a pair that is more difficult to walk in. I think it's the lack of arch support.
4,Very good! One problem though.,"This movie was very good and I enjoy every time. However, there is one problem. The story builds up to really good plot and then...stops!? It just drops off and leaves you hanging! I hate cliffhangers. Espescially when the chances of a conclusion are slim to none. The movie was good though. I'd recommend it. Just expect to be ticked off when it leaves you without any kind of ending."
3,Please finish it!,"I cannot stand the animes that I have read before and then when I watch the DVD I get really dissapointed! Everything was too simplified! The story did not make sense unless one read the books! The books were superb but this... terrible! It needs another DVD!!!!However, if you read the books you will see that it cannot be compared to the books..."
5,An excellent Clamp Piece.,This DVD is everything you could want if your a Clamp fan and looking to finally sink your teeth into the RG Veda series. It has tons of extras that were wonderful and an AWESOME CD ROM Art promo that was unexpected. Well worth the 25 dollar price tag with 90 Minutes of CLAMP Goodies.
5,An excellent masterpiece by CLAMP,"This is a personal favourite. Still, those who are not familliar with RG Veda may not enjoy it, so I'd say it'll be better if you read the manga first or you'll end up, ""Huh?! What the heck did I just watch?!"" I'm a CLAMP fan and I love every work of CLAMP's. I had a little trouble with the voices for Taishakuten and Kendappa-oh though. I'd never imagined their voices to be like it was. Taishakuten's voice sounded...weird and Kendappa-oh's could be a little less dull. ^v^'''' The other characters especially Yasha-oh, Ashura and Karura-oh had excellent voices that suited them very well though I wished that it would be a little longer. For me, it ended too fast. *_*"
2,Couldn't stand it!!,All I want to say is....I was sorely disappointed. I have the VHS and don't care to even finish seeing the rest. The voice character choice for the main characters was annoying in the least.
4,No more mess!,"This product is great because it allows me to have a constant marinade next to the grill, without dripping it over my grill table. The cup is setup nicely so the brush drips back into the main cup. The brush is great too - does a fantastic basting job! My only complaint is that Amazon stated it is dishwasher safe, but the packaging clearly states that dishwasher is NOT recommended."
5,QJ,This was a fantastic transaction!!! Everything was exactly as described. I have this album in storage and was amazed that there was a cd version of it. I've been playing it everyday. Thanks!!! Highly recommend!!! A+++++
5,Amazing...,"I listen to this everyday and I think it's Quincy's best. A must have, if you are into Rare-Groove, Funk, and Jazz.hiptuc"
1,Automatic turnoff is a real turnoff!,"I purchased these headphones a couple of months ago even after reading the negative feedback. I wish I would have listened. The headphones really do automatically cut-off when the music stops or when the audio is at a low level such as a very quite scene in a movie. There is also a constant low level hiss in the background.I know it is tempting to buy these because of the cheap price, but it really is worth it to spend a little more money on a higher quality set of wireless headphones."
4,Excellent product for the $$$,"Have wanted to purchase a pair of wireless headphones for quite sometime but when I saw these on sale for the price, it was hard to pass up. I am very satisfied with the product and results. I can now watch TV, listen to music, in bed without disturbing my now asleep wife. I also have a small hearing problem, so I wish I would have know about these for my parents or any older folks who have lost hearing and find it difficult to hear the TV. Rather than turn the volume up sky high others can actually have a conversation without screaming. Good value for the money and would recommend to all. Very easy to set up and get started."
2,Somewhat OK...,"I got these headphones for christmas, and they were great! I'd give it five stars, if it wasn't for the terrible auto-off feature that it has. I meditate alot and I like to listen to new-age streaming radio, but when the signal gets too weak or the music stops for a few seconds, the transmitter turns off, causing a horribly-loud, cacophonous static. I mean, its just horrible. Why is this even implimented? Is it to prevent people from leaving the headphones on after they've finished listening to music by giving them a horrendous screeching sound? :POther than that, they were excellent. Great sound, and the best thing is I can go around the house listening to music on my computer."
3,Works for me,"I use them at work and they work fine. There is a semi-constant static in the background, or sometimes a high-pitched whine, but this can usually be ignored, or you can tune away from it. I use them at work, so I don't have any problems with interference from other phones and such.The main problem I have with them is that they squash my ears down, because the cups don't have enough padding on them. This became extremely uncomfortable after an hour or so. I modified mine with some foam rubber that I had lying around, and now they are rather more comfortable, although they look a little silly.So, thumbs up for the price; thumbs neutral for the static; thumbs down for the ergonomic design."
1,Uncomfortable strap,"I bought these at a local store, but I took them back, because when you wear them, there is a strap that hugs tightly to your head and actually presses down against your head considerably. This is uncomfortable and would really suck for someone like me, since I'm prone to getting headaches. I didn't even bother seeing how well these headphones worked, because even if they worked perfectly, I wouldn't have wanted to keep them."
3,Having problems from the start,"It took me some time to find the signal, and when I did I had to be satisfied with a diminished volume in the left ear cup, and a constant high-pitched buzz. Besides these problems, it really is great to be able to walk around in my apartment freely and still have audio, and I've gotten use to the above mentioned issues. These are my first set of wireless headphones and knowing what I know now, I would definitely spend the money for a better set, it's worth it. I haven't had the problem with the auto-turn off as I haven't stopped audio yet, but I would certainly understand what an annoyance that would be, and would avoid that feature. Yes to wireless headphones, but spend the money and get good ones, these ones are not the best quality."
2,not worth 40$...,A couple songs are of decent quality. The rest are poorly recorded. All the songs rock. Try to find for cheaper.
4,This book invites young minds to think divergently.,"This was a book I used to write notes to my children on their lunch napkins. Every day a riddle, joke or pun was the topic of conversation that evening. Now, I use it when I send email to my granddaughter. A little humor with jokes that do not make fun of anyone, is high on my list of musts. I also teach 6th grade, and they are constantly asking for more puzzles. They have to listen carefully and may have to look at a word or phrase with a different perspective to find the answer. Example: ""Wally: Do you know how to play baseball? Sally: Sure I do. Wally: Then tell me how you hold a bat? Sally: By the wings of course."""
3,Disappointed.,"The product in the picture looks golden and bright. The actual mirror doesn't look quite as golden, but seems a bit darker. Also smaller than I expected."
5,Lace look sandalwood hand fans,"These hand-held fans are much lovelier when seen ""in person"". I kept one for myself and gave the other 2 to friends, who loved them also. Wonderful use in church in the hot weather and very ""dressy"" looking. The merchant and the product are both great. Shipping, handling and pricing all well within the normal range. Another great buy through Amazon."
5,Sandalwood Scented Wooden Fans,"These are lovely and the sandalwood scent is great. Glad I bought these, 2 for gifts and one for me."
5,sweet smell,"Standard sandalwood fans. They smell great, the price is really good for the package of three. nice to have a couple extra to share with friends!"
2,Way too heavily scented,"Given how inexpensive this fan is, I thought it worked pretty well. But the sandlewood scent is so strong that it nearly chokes me when I use the fan near my face. I left it open on the screened porch for several weeks to see if the scent would lessen, but no luck. Buying something that doesn't smell."
4,Very nice fans.,"These are nice Sandlewood fans that can be used when the 'Stuffy' air needs to be moved somewhat, the construction is decent but the fact you get three makes up for any supposed defect in this.the only gripe is a lack of locking it closed (So it doesn't open up in a purse or glove box and get caught.) this is remedied with the aid of a small tool called a rubber band (Not the most advanced tactic but it works.)I've bought several of these for my mom and her friends love them so much she keeps needing more, a nice inexpensive item that you should feel comfortable loaning out and not worry about getting it back."
2,Perfect for decoration; not for actual use,"The seller shipped the product quickly, using excellent packing materials. However, one of the fans broke after a two weeks. If you only use these fans for display purposes, they are fine. But if you actually use the fan, it will fall apart."
5,A different point of view . . .,"This is a 'perfect' Regency, following the habits and mores as we've come to know them, of wealthy, titled country folk who take great exception to anything that disrupts their notion of how life should go on. All the standard characters and situations are here, deftly described in Ms. Martin's usual humorous way, but with the notable exception that the heroine ends up with -- another heroine. There is also a gay romance that ends well. It is a very gentle love story, not at all titillating, so if you're looking for exposition into lesbian or gay habits you won't find them in this book. Except, of course, to discover they're just people, like the rest of us, with the same wants and wishes and problems to face in everyday life. However, if you want a well-written, well-told, well-thought-out and witty story, set in this favorite era, I don't think you'll be unhappy if you read this book. I would highly recommend it, in fact, because of all these reasons."
2,Not worth the effort to slog through,"If you've read Michelle Martin's other books and loved the humor and wit stay away from this one. Lots of angst and very little humor. The last third of the book is pretty good and the closing scene was very funny, but it's not worth plodding through the rest to get there. Pembroke Park is a lesbian romance. That's fine, but does every hetro character in the book have to be evil or unbearably silly?"
3,It's actually not bad.,"I stuck my neck out, or a few dollars anyway, and bought this based on my love of Beach Boys music and the other reviews. It's actually quite enjoyable and represents a different take on the great Beach Boys hits.So, if you love the Beach Boys and would like to hear a somewhat different but very competent approach to their classics, this might be for you."
5,Nice concert - good recording quality,"A very nice concert which has Al Jardine play loads of Beach Boys classics. Contrary to some of the bands live offerings, the voice quality on this recording is excellent and Al Jardine refrains from the Mike Love ""Yeah"" and ""Come On"" shouts. Even though this is only one member of the band, I would rate this as my favourite ""old Style"" Beach Boys Live Album.Definetly worth listening to."
2,only ok,"This is a better way of documenting the sad career of Al Jardine. Once a Beach Boy, he left after the death of Carl Wilson to write his own kind of music with his sons. That didn't seem to work out and so we have this set of Beach Boy mostly played in the same order as they were with the original band...nothing new! Unfortunately the BB group (offical band with one and a half original members) will not take him back after his snubbing and he's paying the price. This sure beats his silly children's book!As to the quality of this cd...recording is good on some levels and not on others...hearing Carnie breath on Darlin is quite distracting and you don't have to listen closely to hear the ""overdub"" of an enthusiastic audience...probably from another show with another band! If you like the songs, you'll enjoy this recording."
1,Robert's 10-46 Jamb Saw,"Chose this saw because of the sterling reviews here on Amazon. I bought it for undercutting jambs and baseboards for pergo flooring at my son's house. Started in the largest room and everything was proceeding swimmingly. I found it easiest to cut a couple of feet at a time and then move and reposition for the next cut, until the saw just would not switch back on after 30 feet of pine, ranch baseboard molding. The motor was not hot, no fried smell. No reset, Am sending this back to Robert's on 7/20/2012, will update this review after saw is returned. However, I have had to get another saw so I can continue, if the Robert's gets back in time I'll try it."
4,good tool,Good tool fence could be a little better design takes some doing to make exactly straight but overall is good cuts great
2,cheap,"cheap made, guide will not stay on, it will do the job, but adjustments need to be made after a few cuts"
5,"SCX, compact car","Pricey at $24, but a fast little car, stays on the track better than the larger nascar looking models. Would shop around for a same item at a better deal."
2,Not his Best,"I first listened to a few of his songs for this album and then another. I thought I'd give him a try and I must say I was disappointed, seems each song was like the last and it got pretty boring."
5,Fills the senses with post-war Japan scenarios.,"Everybody has a story, no matter how famous or ordinary the individual is. This great work by Ishiguro gives us the inner workings of the minds of young and old in post-war Japan. The lives of young people living and working toward their dreams are the same with any generation--during a war and after a war. Ishiguro deserves a lot of praise for this work. This would make an excellent film that would appeal to the international audience"
4,more subtle than rotd,"this is essentially the same story as remains of the day, told in the same style. it predates the more famous novel, however, so perhaps that's why i would have to say rotd is the more technically accomplished work. perhaps ishiguro had yet to perfect his style. that having been said i found 'artist' to be far more subtle, profound and affecting. the title is a brilliant metaphor for the ideologies that swept through japan, first facism in the 30s then capitalism in the 50s. a bit slow in the beginning but absolutely recommended."
3,Boredom in Japan?,"Ishiguro is a master at impregnating ordinary situations with tension. He does that in this book as well, but ultimately, there wasn't very much to be tense about. This earlier work is not nearly as successful as his later efforts."
2,Hmmm,"Both of Ishiguro's novels set in Japan are lovely pieces, but for some reason I can't connect with the stories, including, of course, this one. It could be cultural; it could be simply that I'm not ready. I adore all his other work; as a writer myself, I study his narrative voice for its sterling quality. But this is one I would recommend with reservations. I will come back to this eventually and I would wager I will love it."
3,Not Ishiguro's Best,"Literary buffs will love all of Kazuo Ishiguro's writings simply because they are so much deeper than they seem to be. ""An Artist of the Floating World"" is about a retired Japanese artist trying to come to terms with his past (aiding the government during WW2) and trying to make sense of the present (the new Japanese generation who are resentful against him).I gave the book only three stars because, while readable by all means, it simply fails to be very entertaining which, arguably, is the object of fiction writing. If you love English literature or are writing a research paper on Ishiguro, this book is great. But casual readers should first try ""The Remains of the Day,"" also by Ishiguro."
4,Doesn't really fit Zen Stone Plus,It looks really cute on the picture. Unfortunately it's a little too small for my Zen Stone Plus. It still fits in though it looks stretched... It kinda attract dust too. The silicon is kinda transparent.
1,This magazine is in French,"I bought a subscription to this publication, and after much anticipation it arrived. I cannot comment on the quality of the writing, or the merit of the articles because it is in French. I do not know French. I didn't realize this when I ordered it, but I guess it's cool to receive mail from France... I am saving my magazines for when I meet someone that can read French, until then this publication will remain a mystery to me."
3,Just what the title says,"The book certainly does justice to the title. My only complaint is that the book seemed rather light on details for the price. But if you're looking for a quick & dirty introduction to C#, the author certainly does the job."
3,"Adequate introduction, but many errors","This book is a usable introduction. It is not a reference (as claimed on the back cover), the presentation is fairly imprecise, it is irritating that 1-2 page long examples are repeated verbatim when only two lines change, and there are many small errors throughout. But I actually learnt something from reading it, and especially from consulting the freely available C# Language Specification when puzzled by the presentation in this book."
2,Superficial and smug,"This book is not a complete waste of time.It does list most of the language features, but the examples are silly, repetitive, and pretty useless. One wonders why, for instance, the example given for how to call Win32 functions uses MessageBox. Is that the most usefull of the Win32 functions, or is it just too complicated to give an example of how to use a ""by reference"" parameter?The disparaging remarks about other languages, particularly C++, are ugly and only serve to emphasize the shortcomings of the author. If comparing this book to - for instance - ""Introduction to the C++ language"" by Stroustrup, one is struck by the advantages to an author of knowing both how to write in English and to write code, both areas where Eric Gunnerson has room for improvement."
3,"Good reference, but somewhat glossy.","Eric Gunnerson, A Programmer's Introduction to C#, 2/e (Apress, 2001)The title of the book pretty much tells you all you need to know, though it might better have been termed ""A Programmer Who Knows How to Read Microsoft Documentation's Introduction"" etc. Gunnerson is (of course) more complete in his overview than the Microsoft documentation team usually are, but the book does assume more knowledge than even most intermediate programmers already have. Specifically, while one can assume, say knowledge of the basic way string classes work, the book treats some of the more esoteric new features of .NET with the same glossing, leading to some confusing passages.This is definitely a worthwhile reference book, as an adjunct to your more in-depth reading, but isn't a good starting point. ***"
5,Excellent - the best C# book I've found,"Easily the best C# book on the market. If you want to learn the C# language (as opposed to an introduction to OOP or .NET), then this is the book to get - it's clear, to the point and easy to follow. I've purchased and returned about half a dozen C# books (just search Amazon for C# and you'll see which ones) before discovering this book. Gunnerson writes in a clear and concise style that's simply refreshing after going through so many other poorly written books."
1,Don't waste your money and time.,"First, this book does not show how to use the .NET NGWS SDK. The code is not followed by any output. Second, the topic are so disorganized that beginners will feel lost no sooner that the first chapter. Third, the technology is not ready yet. It is still vaporware. Thing don't compile once you get sarted with MS docmentation. Things are incomplete all over the place. It's a total waste of time. Ask me? Come back after 6 months. May be they will have something solid.Please don't waste your time. thanks Jim"
1,Poorly done and very superficial,"The title says it all. This book looks like it was slapped together in a very rushed manner. There are 300 pages to this book and 30 chapters! Not only does that come out to 10 pages a chapter, but some chapters are literally (no joking!) 1 or 2 pages long!Add to that fact the following: Many chapters present a sample that is 100 lines long to represent something that could have been illustrated in a 10 line program. The author then make a single statement about an alternative and re-dumps the entire 100 lines of code with one or two changes!Needless to say there is absolutely no meat whatsoever to this book. Very disappointing since it was touted to be ""the"" C# book from a member of the design team."
4,Yet Another Book for experienced C/C++/Java programmers...,"This book is very good if you have a C++ or Java background already... just as it is described. It's unfortunate that the first beginning level tutorial book (Sam's) isn't due to be published until August. I think that's a real diservice to all of us who'd like to get in on the ground floor of C# and .NET... as it is, a small group within the company I work for and myself (there are about 9 of us) have taken up the grand task of learning everything .NET Framework by downloading anything and everything available on line. It would be great if there was a really good step through the procedures publication out there like David McClanahan's PowerBuilder 6: A Developer's Guide--probably the best PowerBuilder instructional book out there. Alas, by the time anything of that quality is available, it'll already be obsolete--for our purposes anyway."
4,Really good programmers book; few things to watch out for,"This is the best book on C# currently available. Eric does a great job and his inside knowledge shows through often. I don't hesitate to recommend this book if you know C, C++, or Java. However, be aware that .NET is still in beta and that some of the features of the currently available SDK download differ from the explanations in the book. For example there is a serious ""difference of opinions"" on interfaces on page 86 and struct relational operators on page 116. I'm sure that Eric or someone will soon be publishing an errata list for the book on the web which will help to alleviate problems like this (which are almost inevitable given how new .NET is). Good value for money."
1,APress money grab,"Another money grab by APress to take advantage of people by selling them two editions of the same swill. This book is contains pedestrian examples and fills itself with repeated blocks of code until the reader becomes nauseated. Do yourself a favor by avoiding this book, then go buy ""Inside C#"" by Tom Archer - a much better introduction to C#"
3,Reason,C# is a new programming language from Microsoft. Microsoft apparently is relying on C# to attract some of those 2 million plus Java programmers back into its fold. Microsoft has decided to make C# an open standard and has in fact (along with Intel and HP) submitted the specifications to the ECMA. Sun has pulled back on the ECMA standardization process and Java remains a properietary Sun product. Sun's many mistakes in dealing with the Java community is what has given Microsoft another shot at reclaiming mindshare among developers. I suspect that C# will be a very important language for developing computer applications over the next decade. This is a reasonable introduction to the language. It is much better than the other C# intro book currently on the market.
1,A Waste of Money,Provides no more information than is available free or at very low cost from numerous other sources online or in periodicals. Poorly organized and very poorly written.
3,Not as good as you wish,"There are lots of errors in this book. Some errors are even thesyntax errors. Maybe becuase of the version problem? I don'tknow. I am using Beta2.I don't know currently there is any other good book in C#or not. Since the language is still new, we maycannot expect an excellent book for now."
3,Great Style,I enjoyed this book the most out of all of Ms. Breton's (though I still haven't read Criminal Intent.) She has a great balance of romance and suspense with a subtle style. Her characters are believable and likable. I empathized with the Priest's inner struggles and his character was not weakened in any way by this turmoil. Give her books a try - you won't be disappointed.
3,Good idea gone wrong,"The story is good, and the heroine plucky, but I could not get over the idea of a priest as the romantic hero. Father Clancy was a great character, but the breaking of his vows, in the light of all recent news events, was difficult to swallow. I far prefer Final Exit, her first work."
4,2nd time a charm,"I had to return this dish due to having a wobbly top. The replacement came in and it was fine. Goes with rest of dishes great. Amazon return was quick and easy. It was actually the dish that was warped, not the top."
5,Pearl of a book!,"Amelie you may have had to eat crow in Japan, but you've spit out a pearl. I've been meaning to read this book for some time and regret it took me so long. This is the kind of book I love. The interactions of the characters make plain the purpose of the book. No long-winded heavy-handed theme building here. She tells a mesmerizing story in a small book. I've always wondered if the Japanese truly think they're as culturally superior as rumor has it. I'm glad someone wrote a novel without sugar coating the cultural differences in thinking and behaving. Brava Amelie!"
5,Fascinating & humorous view of Japan,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as a person who has always been fascinated with Eastern (especially Japanese) culture. This narrative was interesting, including cultural aspects of business, gender, work ethics, manners, and friendship. It was humorous and brief, an enjoyable and enriching read for a few hours."
2,"The author was young, inexperienced and had no useful skills",It can indeed be extremely stressful for a Japanese speaking foreigner working at a Japanese company in Japan. I say this from direct personal experience. But my impression is that the author's only skill was the ability to speak Japanese. She had no basic office skills e.g. she was unable to perform simple calculations. And she had neither business training nor business experience. Amelie Nouthomb's degree was in philology not business or economics or finance. This being the case she was unqualified to perform any complex tasks. Little wonder that her brief experience of working in Japan was such a disaster.
1,"Complete lie about Japan, Japanese people and Japanese culture","Yet another proof of rotten Western civilization, full of narcissism and atavistic colonialism. Simply, they don't see anything except their western values which they put for unknown reasons in an absolute. For example, wouldn't it be natural to return all the salary to the Japanese company if she hates them so much? Job is a job, once you get paid (by the way,I wonder why the amount of her salary never was mentioned), you can leave all your complaints to yourself. Is her conscience clear that she is bad-mouthing people who pay her decent salary ?How high, for example,is unemployment rate in United States now? 8,1% ?Or in France among arab population ? 90% ?Wouldn't be those unemployed people happy to accept job offer to calculate the balance or even to clean toilet if they are offered 3500-4000 USD in cash per month (equivalent of 80-90K per in US)?Or do you think her salary was lower?"
5,Looks even better than the picture,"I tried a 20"" and a 24"" black leather studded collar from a local store but they were too short or too long for my 75 lb mixed breed brindle coat dog. I just received this stunning 22"" collar, strapped it on my big boy, and we were both amazed. He's not a mean dog, but with this collar let's just say he struts around with a little more ""authority."" The workmanship is superb and the collar is a very good value for the price. Nearly half what I paid in the retail store."
5,My #1 Assistant,"I consider myself an excellent speller, however, this little book serves as a constant reminder that there are days when the brain is not operating a full level (usually in the afternoon) and I need to confirm how to properly spell a word, even a simple one, as those can be the hardest at times."
2,"Better choices out there than this, I hope","This camera case has a very unyielding opening and every single time I get my camera out of the bag, it takes too much force, and usually my camera's on switch gets snagged and is turned on or off as I'm taking it out or putting it away. Bag is too large for my purposes (I have a Nikon Cool Pix) and the camera isn't secure but flops around once this overly roomy but with not elastic or other straps to hold camera in place. Not very safe in my opinion for the camera. On the plus side, the compartment on the outside was handy for extra memory cards, batteries and even accomodated the charger. I wouldn't get this again, though and will be replacing it in the near future."
4,Like this camera bag,My Canon PowerShot A630 which I also purchased for Amazon fits perfectly in the bag. Its compartment are handy for easy carrying of extra battries etc. I am pleased with my choice of purchase. I know it will be perfect for me to carry during the Carnival Parade in Jamaica next year.
1,Defective,I have loved and worn out one of these same harmonicas. This one is too hard to blow so I can't play it.
1,buy somwher else!!,"this is a little set of five pets that is going outragesly high for forty five dollers!!!!!!!! I saw a set at toys-r-us that had seven pets and it was going for five ninty nine!!!! toys-r-us did not have any set that expensive unless they came with a playhouse!!! shop there or at wal-mart or somting, but do not waste you money on this!!!!sighned,Anne Age 10"
4,beautiful natural voice,"I found Peter's voice to have a very touching and beautiful sound. Having read his book-it certainly is amazing that he is the man he is after living thru a devastating childhood. I would purchase every CD available--if only Amazon would provide them.Of course, the opera purists will have a great time trashing him but the average person will enjoy his singing immmensely."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I don't think this book is quite what I thought it would be from the description and reviews. It's not really a history of the team at all but a lot of lists and stories and quotes and stats. Some are interesting but others aren't. Although the book has plenty of pictures they are printed awfully small and the paper is sort of thin so the pictures bleed through from one page to the next, which makes it sort of distracting to read. And even though it is more than 400 pages the print is quite large, which makes the book feel like it was written for young adults."
1,...hated it!,"This one was bad, cheesy. I'm sure every movie has potential, but that doesn't make it a better movie if it falls short - which this one does. Wanna know what its about? Read one of the other reviews. Wanna know if you should skip a movie that sucks? Skip it"
1,Throw this DVD in the HOLE,"Did we watch the same movie? Are all you guys friends with the director and producer? After seeing the 5 star rating I thought what the hell. Boy, was I wrong. I kept watching, hoping it would get better but it just never did. Why was this rated R too? The MPAA is so offbase half the time. Anyway, this was like watching an Afterschool special. ""The film also has a fantastic performance from Diamond Dallas Page""? You have to be kidding! The acting was mediocre at best, the so called mystery was pretty easy to figure out and if you think just flashing a quick ghostly image and turning up the volume produces scares it doesn't. The story was somewhat original but intense and scary, you guys are dead wrong!"
1,"after school, g rated, horror movie","The best thing about this movie is the box cover. To paraphrase another review, this is an after school, g rated, horror movie."
2,errors,"The book covers everything, but I bought this more for the practice exams. There were numerous errors in the answers. I spent way too much time trying to figure out why my right answers were considered wrong. Inexcusable!"
1,never got it,I never recived this book I pd for it but no book.Anyone know where it went? I know where the money went.
2,it doesn't fit,"i dont think its just my body. when i pick it up it looks about the size for a 5 year old. Its really small. Ive ordered other lily of france items and they fit fine. if u want to buy this, i suggest buying a couple of sizes larger. seems like they used half the amount of needed cloth to get half the price."
1,Helpful information but disturbing editorial stance,"Vercollone et. al. provide some very helpful information, but they suggest that you should not tell your child that s/he was the result of donor insemination. They spend a great deal of time discussing the stigma attached to DI, yet they seem to be perpetuating this by suggesting that the child should not know about it. Also, this book's focus is on heterosexual couples using DI. It does not claim to be for lesbians."
3,Helping the Stork,"Honestly, I felt this book was ""just okay"". It was informative, but a dry read. Also, it focuses mostly on couples."
1,Not good if you're looking for information,"If you're looking for information about donor insemination, this is not the place to find it. You won't find anything about ovulation, LH surges, or the pros and cons of using frozen sperm in this book. This is a book strictly for heterosexual couples about the ""emotional journey"" of deciding to use donor insemination when they realize the husband is infertile."
4,A great book to help with the loss!,"I am a DI adoptee and I recommended this book to my mother. She really felt validated by the book. As an DI adoptee I also recommend ""Adoption Forum"" by Kasey Hamner. It covers DI from all angles. And those touched by DI are represented in many of the other topics. Oh, and remember, always disclose!!"
2,Good tracks don't make up for the bad ones,"Well, everybody says this is such a great 007 soundtrack, but I'm not particularly pleased with it. The Sheryl Crow song is all right, I love the White Knight and Backseat driver tracks, and the Paris/Bond love theme is just out of this world, but it all doesn't make up for the rest. Most music on this album is just a bunch of orchestral humbug, and it has nothing to do whatsoever with the John Barry music that worked so great for the Bond films. The worst track by far is the K.D. lang song, it is just awful and another bad Goldfinger imitation. Arnold could have made something out of this song if he hadn't just blown it up to the monstrousity it is now. Hopefully he'll try better for The World is not Enough."
2,Boring...,This was a very boring CD. It was only two songs I really liked; sheryl crow's tomorrow never dies and k. d. lang's surrender. Don't buy it!
3,Not quite good enough.,"Something of a disappointment, unfortunately. Music is such an integral part of 007 flicks, and David Arnold's score misses as often as it hits. On the plus side I enjoyed the Sheryl Crow title song (maybe I was the only one), and I rather liked his music to the sequence where Bond steers his BMW around the Hamburg parking garage in the backseat with a remote control (""Backseat Driver""). But the rest of the score is lags and feels too timid. I far more enjoyed the score to ""The World Is Not Enough""."
1,Bond is back,"After seeing GoldenEye and hearing the soundtrack I was a little worried about TND's music. I mean, lets face it, music is as much a part of James Bond movies as are the guns, gadgets, and women! And Eric Serra's score for GoldenEye just didn't work. However, I knew David Arnolds Score for TND was going to be good after I saw the opening to the film and heard the best rendition of the James Bond theme since The Living Daylights (John Barry's last stint as Bond composer). So if you like good old orchestrated Bond music this is the one for you!"
5,Another great title from David Arnold!,"This is,without a doubt,the best James Bond soundtrack ever.Arnold has managed to write an even better version of the Bond theme than John Barry,using horns.It only appears once in the entire CD though(Check out the beginning of track4)."
4,"Excellant score, great soundtrack!!!","A return to the John Barry formula of Bond music. Only downfall is the missing parts of the score from the end of the film. All and all however, a great soundtrack. I love ""White Knight(track 2)."" If we can't have John Barry, we'll take David Arnold!!"
3,Worth it for one great song,"Even if he's no match for John Barry, David Arnold's score for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is generally effective. Unfortunately, the title song, like the title song for ""Goldeneye,"" is perfectly dreadful. The closing song, ""Surrender,"" which also makes use of the film's title, is far superior in every way. As sung by K.D. Lang, it is, in fact, memorable, much more so than the rest of the score or even the film. This disc is worth buying for that track alone."
4,"David Arnold, the next John Barry???","David Arnolds score for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was excellent. It had everthing a great Bond film score should have. I really liked David Arnold's ""moderate"" musical approach for this score compared to Eric Serra's very ""liberal"" musical approach. Arnold did an excellent job combining orchestral music with contemporary rythyms. I also liked how he used the James Bond theme throughout the film. This CD, however, has the same problem that the ""Thunderball"" soundtrack had. Most of music from the second half of the film is missing. I do hope that the rumored ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" Vol. 2 CD will contain some of the films great cues not on the original soundtrack such as: the second half of the pre-title sequence, the scene where Bond escapes from Carver's warehouse to his hotel, and the Hong Kong sequence... I hope that David Arnold's score for ""The World is Not Enough"" is just as good or better!!!"
2,Average......at best,Very similar to the last Arnold soundtrack. The cover song by S. Crow is by far the worst in the whole series.
3,A Lesser Effort,"I will admit being worried about how I would enjoy the movie after buying the soundtrack a few days earlier. The Sheryl Crow title theme is a worthwhile effort, but it was hard to find any tracks that excited me much. Sure, the instantly-recognizable homage to John Barry's style in the early tracks are nice, and the Moby Bond theme is fun, but I couldn't find much life out of this soundtrack. Maybe I was jaded by the movie, which had its share of problems as well. Sure, a must for Bond fans, but somewhat disappointing."
2,Incomplete and Hard to Use,"I bought this book at the beginning of my search for Graduate Schools. After researching on my own and comparing the information I found with that in this book, my experience is that this book is very incomplete (excluding whole schools/programs). Also, what information I did find in this book was very hard to use/follow."
4,Gets the job done,It keeps my ears warm while bicycling. Seems to fit my large-ish head pretty well. No major complaints except the construction quality isn't really amazing.
5,"Terrific story - full of love, tons of humor and adult issues","I read this twice already. One moment I am laughing out loud and a chapter later I am shaking my head in amazement at the depth of emotion the author gives us as experienced by the lead characters. My heart went out to them and the next chapter I would be applauding their ability to rebound from the blows life gives them.You can't help loving the characters and all their complexities. These are well rounded people with many layers to them. As always the back stories for all the characters are original and entertaining.Buy a second copy for a friend, don't lend it- you won't get it back !!!I do have one comment to make about an earlier review. The reviewer didn't enjoy this novel as it wasn't epic historical fiction. I was confused, the reviewer was looking for historical fiction from an author known for hip modern romances with a good dose of humor. You wouldn't compare James Mitchner to Noel Coward, both are fantastic in their own genre."
4,Typical (Incredible) Kallmaker...,"I have to admit to being a huge Kallmaker fan, so beware this review is already biased! This book is a great romance that takes place Iowa. I'm not really sure what made her place this one in Iowa. If you've ever been there, it seems like there is nothing but corn for miles and miles.Liddy leaves California to recover from a rocky relationship gone bad. She heads to Iowa City - a place with a very high percentage of lesbians - to work on a research project for a popular writer.Marian, the librarian, is also dealing with a failed relationship, but secretly falls for Liddy, her new next-door neighbor. Neither woman is ready to take the relationship plunge again, but their mutual friends and thier libidos have different plans for the duo.Very hot. Very sexy. Be prepared for a VERY cold shower when this one is done. This book is solid proof of why Kallmaker continues to be one of the reigning queens of lesbian fiction."
2,stunted growth,"I used to look forward to Kallmaker's novels but this one has cooled my anticipation. It was trite, stereotyped and silly. Even as a Physician, I was turned off by so much focus on mentstrual cramps and flow. The characters were not well developed and mostly not evolved.... the degrees of separation between the characters appeared incestuous. It depicted the lesbians as under-developed emotionally and all I wanted was for the book to end (predictably) already. The sex scenes were commonplace, same Kallmaker: against walls, on floors, in the shower and on countertops and of course, the old joke persists: What do lesbians make on the second date? U-haul arrangements.But on the positive side: I now know how books are catalogued in the Dewey system."
1,Very bad book,"I didn't like this book at all, it was all past tenseprophecies. It talked about abraham comleteing prophicies but thebible was written long after that! I could say in my ""book ofprophecies"" that ""Ohh in the 1960's President Kenedy will beshot in Dallas, Texas!"" It's stupid!..."
5,The biggest boy bsb fan you could ever dream of,If You want a soothing cd this is the one hey im a boy but i like the backstreet Boys cuz they sing great even though their other cds are also cool toooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Blather,"Blather. Blather blather blather... That about sums it up. Even Sorensen's cogent points are incoherent. To say that the Democratic party Sorensen paints is ""principled"" must be, frankly, a sarcastic joke. And one made in the poorest taste. If his really is an accurate reflection, the Democratic party has fully forsaken its roots to finally cater only to hatemongers. This book is likely neither to convince the opposition nor to satisfy the adherent. I really don't see what good there is in it. No matter how much a Democrat you are, I have to believe that almost any other book is more suitable to your sensibilities."
5,A cookbook that every guy can use,"If you are only going to have one cookbook, get this one. It gives you lots of quick and easy recipies for professionals on the go. If you need to impress a date, open this book, pick any recipie and 30 minutes later you will have her thinking you are a gourmet chef. The list of how to equip your kitchen for basic cooking was a real help--it tells you just what to get so you'll never be running back to the store at the last minure to get the one spice you don't have."
4,Wonderful and Practical,"This cookbook makes it possible to cook healthy, tasty food after you've worked all day and without any compromises. Jennifer is an extremely talented and inspiring writer and cook and unlike most cooks, knows nutrition! As a busy Mom herself, you can't get better advice on what pleases kids. This is not just a list of good healthy recipes (the wonton soup and fruit compote for example are fabulous), but unlike other cookbooks, she actually explains in her introduction professional cooks' best kept secrets and is an inspiration for maintaining the delight of being with your family for a simple, delicious home cooked meal. Say goodbye to those styrofoam take-out dinners, Jennifer shows you how to cook a healthier, cheaper meal in about the same time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there are so few pictures, but the layout and design are topnotch."
2,Warning: Explicit Sexual Violence,"WARNING TO SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVORS: This book has quite explicit depictions of sexual abuse and is likely triggering.The author substitutes gratuitously explicit descriptions of torture and sexual abuse for narrative tension, plot advancement, and character development. Not impressed.This is a book of many flaws: in terms of story, in terms of structure, in terms, even, of simple proofreading. It is tedious, it is populated by almost entirely unsympathetic characters, it has nothing particularly insightful to say about human nature nor has any particularly novel or thoughtful way of putting it. Much of the plot is painfully predictable. It is not utterly without merits: the character of Omelda is well drawn and psychologically realistic, if no pleasure to read. But the only reason I slogged all the way through was because I was stuck home with a cold and had already read the backs of the cereal boxes. I can't imagine recommending it to anyone else."
3,"Better than Maze, not as good as Strands","This was certainly a lot better than Maze of Moonlight, in my opinion. I was so glad that Christopher was out of the picture that that just lightened the book for me. Omelda constantly being raped and not caring, however, ugh. She was such a weak person. And Natil...still boring as ever, but at least she got some good parts here. I was so tired of hearing about her being depressed by the half way point, that I almost threw the book out the window. I'm glad I didn't, because it got better. Not much better, but it did get better. I'm probably the only person who was happy when Omelda's voices finally stopped the way they did. I loved when Natil got a glimpse of the stars in the prison and finally got up the courage that was missing from her for two whole books. She was almost like Miriam."
2,Decent story.....if you can ignore the authors social views,"The idea was a good one.....but the promise of the story was not played out well. I believe the author had an agenda behind writing this book. Perhaps it was the dedication to all women who had been killed by husbands or boyfriends in the state of Colorodo which prefaced the book that tipped me off? The characters in the book, with the exception of the elf Natil, fall into the stereotypical ideas of the abusive male, and the resigned-to-fate female. Most of the action of the book tells of violent acts against women. Several times the author used the phrase, ""men striking women, women scolding men..."" to describe the life in a city."
3,"Just Okay, finish color inconsistent","I ordered this Moen air gap to match my new Moen Oil Rubbed Bronze kitchen faucet. It was a little pricey, but seeing that I could not get one from Lowes or Home Depot, I decided to order it.It works as it is supposed to, but the finishes obviously don't match. I'm not super particular, but I do know that most of my friends would have sent it back due to the variation in Oil Rubbed Bronze finishes. Had I known, I would have purchased the inexpensive, black air gap at HD, and lived with it."
5,Matched my Moen faucet perfectly,"I ordered the air gap to match a moen faucet I already had. It arrived right away and matched perfectly! No complaints from the plumber who installed it, either."
3,Looks great but needs better quality control,"Moen 105895CSL Air Gap with Matching Escutcheon, Classic StainlessJust the thing to match our new Moen faucet I thought. Nice brushed SS finish, easy to install. Only problem was that the threads on the nut are a loose fit on the body of the air gap. Loose enough that tightening by hand causes the nut to jump to the next thread just when the threads start to get tight. I called Moen and they sent a replacement, but it is still a PITA."
1,Shockingly low quality.,"As another reviewer said, they couldn't even get the size of the nut on the bottom correctly. It slips like an ugly pair of oversized pants on a gansta wanna be. The cap on the top is made of really cheap sheet metal. The top inside of the cap is not coated and shows very bad signs of rust. It does have the dull stainless steel look, but with a immediately obvious cheap look. For this you have the privilege of paying 2x - 3x what a generic one would cost at the big box stores."
5,Beautiful,"We bought this to match our new Moen kitchen faucet. I know it's just an air gap, but it looks really cool. The old air gap had a 1/2"" plastic piece on the bottom; this one doesn't. I love looking at my new Moen products each time I walk by the sink. By the way, this product can't be shipped to Vermont or California since both states have stricter lead laws."
3,Average,"What I like about this air gap is that it matches the stainless steel Moen faucet I bought with it. What I don't like is that the cap (the main part that you see) is not firmly attached to the plastic part of the air gap and comes off easily when you clean it (and you clean it often because the stainless steel does not stay clean long). The other thing that is actually the worst part is that it comes with a rubber washer that goes below the sink and nothing that goes above the sink surface to create a waterproof seal. If you put the rubber washer on top, it creates a seal but the washer is so thick that you see too much of it. I could probably have gone to the store and found a thin rubber washer or O-ring but I just set it in a small bead of silicone and so far it's fine. The air gap I replaced didn't have any sort of seal either so it's no worse than any other air gap, it's just something that the manufacturers should address."
1,Plastic threads do not allow for a tight fit,"This unit looks nice but the stiff rubber hose I tried to use kept dislodging the air gap because the plastic threads and plastic nut could not sufficiently hold the unit against the counter top. I tried so many things to make this work like changing the disposal orientation but nothing helped. Returning to amazon. I think ultimately I will use 3/4"" copper pipe for most of the run between the next air gap I buy and the garbage disposal with a couple of small rubber pieces clamped to the copper pipe and air gap/garbage disposal. This way there won't be as much pressure on the air gap."
3,good product but color is off.,"The product is not really the right color. It is slightly orangish. It is slightly off, but not enough to return the item."
2,Video Review,"Length:: 1:48 MinsHopefully my video review will give you a better glimpse inside this book. Book reviews are subjective and just because I am not thrilled with a book, doesn't mean someone else will not love it. This book was hard for me to get excited about and cottage homes are my favorite. I also own a small residential construction company that builds cottage type homes, this book just did not do it for me. Maybe it was the lack of detail or maybe it was the way the book was laid out...I just had a hard time with this book."
2,Could have been better,There are some ok ideas in this book but it suffers greatly from a cramped layout. It's not easy to browse and most of the photo are cropped so close one almost feels claustrophobic just flipping through the pages
3,works for me,"I only use the ab workout and although they are short in duration, I do feel it working out the muscles. I usually do two day workouts at a time. I do recommend this tape in conjunction with other ab workout tapes."
4,Obnoxious to watch - but a great workout,"Some of these gals on tough tape crack me up, but the moves are tough and they work. The girl in the beginning is hysterical! That plastic smile and expressions get me every time - I give it four stars because I am sweating and sore afterwards - thats really all that matters"
4,The FIrm: Firm Parts - 5 Day Abs & Tough Tape 2,"I bought this DVD workout for my mom on Christmas because she had the same copy but on VCR, but it had broke, so I decided to surprise her with this new set, but instead in VCR, it's DVD! She loves it, and I'm happy with it."
2,"No sir, Idont like it",It goes way too fast////i do like the abs workout section but the aerobic section isnt good. I will never buy firm tapes again
3,Don't buy any Firm compilation!!,"About the Tough Tape....Now I know that the Firm are effective, and these workouts will get you in shape. But this is just a lot of old Firm workouts pasted together, and not very well either. You have to keep taking your ankle weights on and off (why couldn't they put the ankle weight workouts together?) and the scenes just jump around all over the place. If you want a good Firm workout, then buy a tape/DVD that isn't a compilation. You'll be a lot happier with your buy.The 5-Day Abs workout does make the whole DVD worthwhile as they're great workouts, but since this is a DVD, I would have preferred if they had made each day's workout a separate scene, so that you could skip to the day you want without having to fast-forward through all the previous days. I might as well have bought the video!!"
1,WHAT?,"Sting, what have you done? Why must everyone keep re-mixing and re-making everything? It's pointless! ARRRRGGHHH! Okay. Enough of that. This used to be a classic. Now, its just some piece of crap that that idiot P. Diddy re-mixed. Seriously, has that guy ever come up with his own song? Please, vote yes on the keep P. Diddy away from music act. Save our music."
1,The worst...,"And that be even worse than Sting in dueth with Craig David who ruined Shape Of My Heart with his pathetic Rise And Fall.I find no good excuse as a big fan of Sting for him to allow this damage strike one of his most famous songs ever.Puffy is awful, no matter if he's a good dresser. His biggest hit ever, I'll Be Missing You -his adaption of Every Breath You Take- first left me with that well-earned impression.Stop messing up Stings' fantastic songs, even though he allows you, Puffy!!!"
1,an absolute disgrace,"With this horrendous track, Sting verifies that he is no longer in the business of making music, but rather is in the business of making as much money as he can. This track is an all time low in the once brilliant songwriter's career and is a slap in the face to all Police fans. I would rather have Sting retire than ruin his past hits."
1,A Must Not Buy for Police and Sting Fans,"This song was licensed and made at the height of Sting's interest to see his catalogue of old songs used. What is so unfortunate for Police and Sting fans is that this song had no reworking or interpretation of the song Roxanne. Other than the song's name and a rare, original sampling of Sting singing the word ""Roxanne,"" there is no resemblance to the original song. No fan considers this song worthy of being called Roxanne, much less being included as a part of their body of work."
3,Radio Spots,"Here's a list of the radio spots on this DVD: The Crypt Of Dark Secrets, The Man And Monster/The Bloody Vampire, The Brainiac/The Curse Of The Crying Women, The Horror Chamber Of Blood And Gore, The Monsters Crash The Pajama Party, and The Corpse Grinders/The Undertaker And His Pals/The Embalmer."
5,Neil Young Journeys,If you are a Neil Young fan it's a must have! Takes you back and interesting home video of him. Recommend to the true fans.
5,Interesting and enjoyable,Thanks so much. Enjoying this purchase. Wished it was more documentary and back story and less concert but it was pretty good.
3,You would hand to be a Neil Young fan,I bought this because of the previews. If I were a died in the wool fan I am sure I would have loved it
3,Too Much Bass,"Enjoyed the movie, but there was too much bass and I know Mr. Young wanted it that way, but it was a real distraction."
1,Boring with lack of sensitivity..,"This video is all about taking a ride in a classic car (nice car!) around Neil Young's hometown. In the beginning as he is talking about what it was like growing up, he makes a statement about blowing up a turtle by sticking a firecracker up its backside, adding a comment suggesting that this was normal for young boys to do. Neil--this is NOT NORMAL! It is horrendous and you should be ashamed!"
1,AWFUL,The reviews and the info on DVD box were totally misleading. This piece of garbage had a lot of nonsense about the set-up of performance venue and riding around in a car talking about nothing.And it had absolutely NOTHING of ht esuppose3dly compelling musical performances described. In short: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRAVESTY.
3,Cheap but useful,"I bought this in an attempt to get a bigger baton for my ensemble without having to pay the price since my conduting teacher recommended I get a bigger baton. I did so. it doens't come with a case, however, so I wasn't able to find a way to store it properly in my bag and it ended up breaking in to a million pieces after like the first rehearsal. I got a better baton that came with a case later and it made such a HUGE different travel wise: it didn't break."
3,Typographical errors ruined my experience.,"I began reading this to my four year old grandchild. She was captivated by each story and wanted me to read another and another. That was great. However, I was shocked to find two glaring typographical errors in the first reading. Using lead instead of led is a basic mistake. I hope being a grandmother does not place me so far out of what is being taught in schools these days, but come on!!!! Get it right!!!"
4,Nice book - good photos,Am pleased with this book. Wanted Aseops with bright pictures so my new Grandson would love them as much as I.
4,Fun reading to my child,I bought this for my 4 year old. We read the stories and look at the pictures. Great little book.
4,Love the illustrations,"I really like the detailed illustrations, the book was delivered in a timely manner and I am satisfied with everything about it. The only reason for I didn't give it 5 stars is because the stories seem somewhat condensed, not a lot of detail."
1,NOT the original recordings,"These are NOT the original recordings. Very disappointed. Fine print on back of CD says ""new recordings performed by the featured artist."""
5,excellent-lots of variety,"This is a great dvd-lots of options for your workout. Karen is easy to follow and personable.I like that some workouts use step,some use the ball and some with no equipment-I like that because I'm not a huge fan of step. Each segment is well laid out and complete, its an effective fun workout that gives you the option to create your own plan depending on how much time you've got and I like that!"
4,Very good workout - the foot work can be a bit confusing....,"This DVD will give you a very good workout. I like the way you can customize what exercises you want to do. It is a nice variety.The down side is Karen's calls, you need to do this a few times to know what you will be doing next. Some of the steps took me many tries to finally get correct. Even now if I don't do the workout for a while i get confused on some of the moves on the step."
1,"BORING with a capital ""B""","Terrible 1979 slasher flick starring Cameron Mitchell as an investigator (with ESP!) searching for a faceless murderer who is preying on young girls. There's lots of talking but very little action. If you can manage to stay awake until the end, at least you can watch the killer chase a naked blonde around. The plot is just like every other slasher film made during the late 70's/early 80's except that THE DEMON is memorable for one thing -- the killer wears a glove with blades on the fingers (years before Freddy Krueger made it chic!). The worst part of the movie watching experience is that the DVD is presented full-frame (not widescreen) and the print that was used to make the transfer was extremely dark. Watch John Carpenter's highly superior HALLOWEEN instead."
2,Would have enjoyed it more if it were not so dark.,"For the amount of money I spent on this film about 3 dollars and 88 cents it wasn't that bad. I enjoy horror films and I'm a sucker for low grade B horror movies. The film kept my interest enough but during each of the murder scenes I couldn't see a darn thing. The transfer of the film was decent during scenes that were filmed during the day and when there was a significant light source. But when it was dark it was almost impossible to watch, and the killer always killed at night and in the dark. This is a problem that seems to happen often with old horror movies from the 70s and 80s that are not transfered well. As far a the film itself goes it was not that horrible I've seen worse. It was a bit boring in the middle and it ends a little abrupt. I wouldn't recommend buying the film for anymore than 5 bucks."
2,No one can hear you scream in the dark,"I've never seen a movie shot ""night for night"" so badly -- this movie is dark and nothing can change that. There are many night scenes where you can barely make out anything at all. The day (or lit) scenes can be surprisingly colorful. The beautiful Zoli Marki is about the only reason to see this train wreck. Cameron Mitchell shows up to utter some stupifyingly bad lines (as some else mentioned: ""He's less than a man. But more than a man. So much more than a man""). Wow -- bad. And despite the fact that the plot makes no sense, the killer/demon's mask appears and then disappears and is not relevant at all, and despite the fact the guy can kill with his bare hands but prefers plastic wrap, and despite the fact he can kind of phase in and out yet at the same time can be held up by doors ... the real sign of a bad movie here is they run out of music during the end credits. Skip it or rent it."
1,Awful Seller,"I have owned Lampe Berger's for several years and have learned that they need to be ""cleansed"" with the Neutral scent (which does not have a scent and can also be mixed with other fragrances to tone them down). Touch of Europe had sent me the product and I immediately realized that the product had sat on the shelf too long and now smelled of rubbing alcohol. I requested a return but learned that because I had opened the product that it could not be returned due to its flammable content. I then requested that they send me another product, and since I already ordered Neutral from another provider (not a part of the Amazon ""family."") that I would like them to send me Patchouli. Once again, they told me that I couldn't return it because of its flammable contents. I've gone round and round on this issue and have not received an acceptable product.Unfortunately, I will never do business with Touch of Europe again. I'm hoping that Amazon will step up to the plate and do the right thing."
2,Doesn't do what it is supposed to do...,"I am guessing they have changed the formula. Other bottles of this I had in the past simply softened the scent of the fragrance I was diluting. This one, well...overpowered the roasting chestnuts fragrance and had a bit of an alcohol scent. I used 1/3 neutral and 2/3 fragrance. Maybe I should have only put a dab in as opposed to 1/3."
5,Budding Conductors,This is a replacement for my son who has dreams to become a conductor. He lost his at band camp. So far has lasted well. Seems to be ok quality.
3,Kind David Duco Tapered Cork Baton,"The handle of this baton is a bit too long, hard to hold it and to make a flexible move."
4,great book!,"i really like this dog book. it covers a few different subjects, like dog groups and dog history. it is mainly a breed guide. it does have a glossary though! that comes in quite handy for those who are just getting started in the wonderful world of dogs. i would recommend it too anyone looking for ""the perfect dog"" since it has soooo much info. on soooo many breeds!"
5,EXCELLENT Book,This book is a wonderful dog book. It says just enough about alot of breeds. Wonderful pictures. This is THE book you should get to know about alot of dog breeds. Highly recommended. FIVE STARS!
1,This is a Noonan Autobiography,"I think this book was one of the most awful biographies I have ever read for the same reasons so many customers think it's wonderful.When I purchased this book, I thought I was getting a biography or portrait of Pope John Paul II. That is what the title suggested. I knew I would get a little personal Peggy Noonan as well. The truth turned out to be just the opposite. This is a spiritual self-portrait of Peggy Noonan and her religious journey. This journey is told in the context of the Pope's life and offers biographical tidbits here and there. But if you want to read about Joun Paul, this book will disappoint you.If you want to read a sugary-sweet, highly emotional and personal portrait of Peggy Noonan that has heavy doses of Roman Catholic apologetics, then this book is for you.If you want an informative yet laudatory account of the Pope's life, I highly recommend Tad Szulc's superior biography instead."
3,Pope John Paul book,"The book came in good time. It was supposed to be new but looks a little dated. It was a gift, so it would have been nicer if it looked a little better. It will be readable though!"
5,Say good-bye to high priced creams,This is a great product if your eyes tear or your skin tingles every time you use so-called hypo-allergenic skin creams. A great all-round moisturizer that really reduces redness. There's a lotion version that's just as mild with SPF 15--maybe a better choice for day time.
4,Works good but doesn't smell pleasant.,"This cream works as described, its good for sensitive skin. But I didnt really notice the calming even color. I was still blotchy. Overall though, its a good product for the price. I would recommend the Eucerin Sensitive Skin cream. Its thicker but really makes the skin calmer than the Aveeno."
1,Every disc damaged directly out of the packaging,"Charmed: The Complete SeriesI purchased this item in a store, I went online to add it to my DVD inventory list on amazon, and noticed someone saying that the many of the discs in their set had either scratches or glue on the discs. I began to examine my own set. I looked each disc carefully to discover that every one of them had either scratches or glue on them, right out of the box. The extent of the damage varies with each disc but all would have been either unplayable or at the very least skipped."
5,You wont regret it !!!!,"This is a must have on your DVD collection!!! The book is simply awsome. It has recipes, incantations, demons from all the height seasons and in between all that you have the episodes guide with pictures and quotes and of course the DVD themselves. At the end of the book you have a Special Feature DVD that includes many things like for example an unaired pilot!!! So dont wait any longer and do yourself a little gift. You wont regret it thats for sure !!!!"
5,The best box set ever,"I love Charmed and I love this box set. 5 stars for this set, the best complete series set ever. It's huge and heavy just like the real book on the show. Great design, illustrations, lot of pictures and episode review. Bonus disc is another plus. Some DVD have scratches though. Still it's a must for all Charmed fans, buy it now when you still can, it sold out quick."
1,Glue causes scratched discs,"Was SO excited to receive this, especially because it is so nicely packaged in a book of shadows. Unfortunately, the disc are glued into the slots. The glue sticks onto the disc, causing significant scratching. Every disc I watched was scrambled and scratched.Returned. Such a shame."
1,Poor quality,This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter but unfortunately we had to send it back. It skipped and some discs wouldn't even play. We were refunded our purchase price.
1,this is being returned,"I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this. While the book the DVDs came in is amazing, the scratched DVDs and DVDs that have glue on them from poor packaging is not amazing. The first DVD I put in went in an endless loop of restarting and would NOT play. I took it out, looked at it and saw the scratches. I looked a the others and they were also scratched. very disappointed :("
2,Slightly disappointing in subtitles,"I bought this series as the package in amazon said ""completely subtitled in spanish"" but to my surprise, only series 8 was subtitled in spanish, all other series were without spanish subtitles.It's ok for me, but for my wife I now have to do some translation on the go. It would have been great if in fact all series were subtitled in spanish (like it said here on amazon)"
5,Great series,"After catching numerous issues on tv I ordered the series. It really is a great series. I highly recommend it. The nice ""Book of Shadows"" case really fits with the series as well."
5,The Book Of Shadows,"I love the packaging in which this series came in. The amazon price is extremely reasonable and well worth it. I wish there were more pictures/spells from The Book of Shadows in the show, but since I'm such a devoted fan I decided to order The Book of Shadows (Charmed) from amazon. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. A must have all the way!"
5,Review and a lot of images,"Heres is the review that I did in my page for this product, it's very beautiful and worth it![..]"
3,My review on charmed collector edition,"The presentation of the items and style reflect the show well. However, the sleave inserts for the DVDs are cut into the pages and thus have a residue from the paper that sticks to the discs. The result on one of the bonus discs is that it skips or freezes up due to the residue in our case. There may be a different result for a different set, but this is our experience with this one. My sister whom is a big fan loved the presentation and art work of this gift, but this sleave insert residue issue really disappoints. Very disappointed on how the discs are affected. They should have been put in traditional plastic DVD casings."
3,"love the episodes, product not great","I love Charmed! This packaged set is beautiful and came all wrapped like it was brand new, but almost every disc has one episode that skips or freezes. not very happy but not wanting to return it and have to wait to get a new one to see the rest of the episodes...."
3,Charmed The Complete Series,I just do not understand why. Most of the Dvd disc work fine. Every now and then it would skip. I have a all brand dvd systems so there is no excuse. My brand new complete series of power rangers work fine. I also ordered that from amazon. Why my charmed DVDS?!!!
3,I love this show...,"Everything was great with this except when I got to the final season the last 3 discs were damaged including the bonus disc, they wouldn't play and kept freezing. So I'll have to purchase the 8th season on it's . :("
5,Great Buy,If you like Charmed you will love this!! Great buy and great collection item.I am very impressed with all of it.
5,Coolest Packaging,I have yet to actually watch any of the DVDs (I just rewatched the series recently) but I absolutely love the package. The 49 DVDs are contained within a replica of the Book of Shadows. The binding is sturdy cardboard. The pages actually contain a few of the spells and some of the information used in the show's Book of Shadows. It looks like a real tome. I was tickled when I opened the box and found this treasure inside. For $50 this was a really good deal.
1,BUYER BEWARE--DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER,I never received my item but was charged. I filed an A-Z claim with Amazon to get my money back since I have not heard from the seller after I emailed. After the loads of negative feedback within the past 30 days it is apparent that this seller met a grave fate and disappeared off the face of the earth (at least in Amazon world.) When I originally bought from them the ratings were high in the 90% but now feedback agrees with the same notion.. the seller is collecting money and not sending the products advertised and bought on Amazon. Amazon needs to investigate and refund us all who have fallen victim.
3,sold and fullfilled?,"Hello. Sorry, this is not actually a review. I bought the small edition of the complete series, but it was damaged, so I read some reviews for the Deluxe Edition and found out it was in better condition. Now I think I'm gonna buy it, but first I would like to know two things please:1. Is it true that disc holders are better in this edition than the other one were? I mean, there aren't scratched discs and everything, right? or what?2. I've been reading that this is not sold by Amazon, but it is Mommy Bear Media who is buying it. Does this make any difference? Can the product be in bad condition if it is not sold by Amazon? Please, solve my doubts. I'm a little desperate and pissed off about my Charmed complete set since it is damaged and I'm dying to have the good one. Thanks in advance!"
2,Glue runined some dvds/some in spanish,"The glue from the pages runined some of the dvds for me and i was unable to watch them. Also, in season 5 the dvds were in spanish and i couldnt change it. If you are willing to not watch some episodes then buy it if not, i wouldnt recommend buying this product."
3,Charmed Complete DVD Set,"Two of the DVDs in the complete set were corrupt. However, only 1 show on each DVD freezes up in one section. It was also difficult to fast forward through the frozen sections of the shows. It would have been nice to receive first quality DVDs for the amount of money we paid.Also, I initially paid over $300.00, then the set went on sale for $279.00 and I received a credit. Now its even cheaper. I would like another credt please."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter. Returned it once/received the replacement; and it had the same problem with a few of the dvd's having glue & some dvd's ""skipping"". Tried to return the 2nd one and try another replacement (she's a big fan & was excited over the gift), I received a notice this is a recurring problem & there wouldn't be a replacement sent but a full refund would be given - but it's still being sold."
2,the packaging scratches the dvd,This is a really cool idea if you like charmed because you get the spell book and whatnot but the packaging scratches your dvds and i had to send it back. some of the episodes skip or dont play at all.
1,Does not work,I ordered these back in October it has taken a little bit to get through them all but none of the disks play all the episodes have never been able to watch the second and thrid episodes on every disk. When I contacted the seller they did nothing about it! For the price we paid for this item that fact that it was completly non watchable was absolutly rediculous!
2,Not what I expected,"The disc were not in order and badly packaged. The pic looked like a better presentation, but I was very disappointed when i received it."
2,Charmed complete series,Charmed- The Complete Seasons 1-7Was a set of videos sent from China. Was resolved and never went back to the site I bought it at
4,great set....,"i read the many problems with this set on the internet... i was going to get the deluxe set but it sold out or wasn't going to pay the top dollar others wanted... i just recieved the regular set, yesterday... all dvds in the box set are in perfect condition.. no scratches or glue marks.... i was suprised considering others were showing pictures of the dvds and returning the set.. i guess i got lucky :) anyway great set and one of my favorite tv series...."
1,Bad disks,"Most of the disks skip a little, but the last 2 seasons are not even watchable. This is a big disk holder and if they are stacked forever in a warehouse, they should not be sold because then the disks seemed to become messed up. Especially since the cases the disks are in are not that soft, they are just hard paper material."
5,perfect,i love it is perfect one of the best shows ever exelend guality dvds and book althou i was expecting more pages on the book
4,one of its kind,i love the show charmed ever since i was a little girl me and my grandfather use to watch it but he passed away before he could see the end even know i have seen ever episode i still love to watch them if i start on one disc i will watch every season. i love this book it is my favorite dvd collection but there was one problem with it some of the dvd would not even play it would just show up as a black screen. but i still love it is my favorite show
1,very disappointed,"I saw this set on amazon for $50 and thought it was a deal for all 8 seasons. The day i received it i opened it and loved the design of the book, then i saw how the discs were packaged. I put the first 3 discs in my player and all 3 skipped, i did not bother to check anymore. I then read all of the reviews on this set and almost everyone else had this problem, i returned it right away. I think amazon should pull this item from its site until the manufacture solves the problem. This gives an all knew meaning to"" you can't judge a book by it's cover"", even though i liked the cover. I will wait for the deluxe edition, which has the discs packaged better, to come on sale."
4,LOVE the series & the Book of Shadows is beautiful but ...,"There is glue/paper stuck to about 14 of the discs, at least one per season, some seasons 2-3 of the discs plus the bonus disc and it doesn't come off easily. I've ordered an exchange/replacement & will go through those discs immediately upon receipt just as I did the first set. I'm hoping between the two sets I'll be able to get clean discs for the whole series - if not I'll return & reorder another exchange/replacement until I do get a clean discs for each season plus the bonus disc.I know this was a problem previously & they were supposed to be reworking the packaging so that it didn't happen anymore but it would appear it's still a slight issue. I would recommend to everyone to check every single disc in the set as soon as you receive it to make sure they are all clean & playable.Series gets 5 stars, packaging gets 1 star =["
2,Scratched Disc's,bought as a gift for my mom she love the book cover but said alot of the last seasons disc were scratched when she opened them and skip bad.
4,glue on disks,I rated this a four because I love this show!...There was some glue on some of the disks but a little alcohol on a kleenex and it came off with no damage to the disks...so far they play fine with no skipping.
1,Scratches and Glue,"I have to say I was really disappointed when I cam to realize after I had opened the set that 4 discs were completely ruined by the glue that were on them. The last disc of season 8 doesn't even read in any DVD player. Needless to say, I completely wasted money on this purchase. Product defect I believe."
2,Mediocre,"Some of the Episodes don't play; some don't play all the way through. I don't know if this was because of the company that produced this product or if the original files were subpar. A few of the episode menus were actually in a different language (it's a region 1 product). And some of the menu titles don't match the actual episodes and the verbiage on the back of the box is misspelled. Is the product successful? Yes- you get to watch almost all of the episodes from eight seasons of the TV show Charmed. Does this product meet the standards of a regular DVD release- NO and not even close to the standards of a ""Boxed Set"". As a side note- the CD Sleeves isn't even glued to the binding. The felt covered box is a nice touch though."
2,Buyer Beware,"I have read a number of complaints about the packaging flaws on this item, yet I was naive enough to believe the issue was likely to be fixed by now. Buyer beware...that was not the case. Not only was the packaging glue stuck all over a number of disks, most of the disks looked like they had been used as toddler toys. Bran new disks should not look like they have been slid across pavement. Some even have chips in the edges! I didn't have much trouble getting the disks to play at first, but at about season 5 I started having all kinds of trouble. I have had to skip about 10 episodes because they simply will not work in any player of any kind. Of course, by the time I got to that point, it was too late for me to contact a seller with a complaint or do anything about it. I have a hard time believing these disks were bran new when the series was recorded on them. I would have to be a fool to think otherwise."
2,Most of the discs skip,"Love this show and love how all the episodes are packaged in the Book of Shadows. However, about 3/4 the way into season 1, the dvd started skipping and getting stuck on one scene. Made it impossible to watch any of season 2. Really disappointed. I ended up just watching the show on Netflix. Definitively not worth the money to purchase this set."
2,Great Series! Horrible Product,I LOVE this series but this product is horrible. Many of the discs that I received have no visible marks or damage but for some reason will not play in any type of dvd compatible player! I received this as a Christmas gift and by the time I realized that the discs were damaged I was unable to return it. My advice: Do NOT buy this product!
1,Buy Individual Seasons-Bad Product- Wonderful Series,"I ordered this and was so excited when it got here. My 10 year old has gotten hooked on the TNT repeats. I thought I would surprise her. We tried to watch the first season disc 1 and it wouldn't play. We tried it on our 2 DVD players, the Xbox 360, and the laptop.....she even wanted to try to play it up in the car. I returned it....awesome UPS service and replacement from Amazon. It still won't play. We tried some of the other discs and found that they will play but they skip and usually the 3rd episode on the disc is the one with the issues. I guess I have to bite the bullet and get each individual season. Not as neat as actually having the ""Book of Shadows"" but at least we can watch the shows together......Love the show but it seems that this just is not a good buy. Save yourself the frustration and purchase the seasons individually. I wish I had read the other reviews before now......"
1,Item shown wasn't item received,I expected the item to be the way it was shown which was a book. It came in a box with the DVD's in little individual holders. It didnt even look good. I tried the DVD's and had no problems with them but it was not what I paid for or expected.
5,Perfect buy,It was everything I expected. Disks all work and book is in great shape. Absolute must for the ultimate Charmed fan!
2,A real disappointment,Too many of the DVDs has scratches and it kept freezing up.... it was very frustrating. I think there should be more quality control.
1,NOT good!,"Should have read the other reviews before buying. Got one yesterday....glue on over half the discs. Called Amazon. Replacement sent. Glue on over half the discs of 2nd set. Instead of letting me return and just get the individual seasons that I need to complete the set, have to go through this whole return, wait for refund ordeal and THEN purchase the individual seasons. Some of which are very low stock. Amazon really needs to rethink their customer satisfaction ideas. In today's economy, it's seems they'd be more interested in keeping customers instead of losing them.Charmed: The Complete Series"
5,EXCELLENT!,I received this product in excellent condition and would recommend anyone to purchase from this seller!
5,Charmed Box Set,This product was better than I expected. I thought that it would be pourly made but it wasn't. In fact it look more like a book than expected.
4,If only they would put out a box set,I have waited a long time to finally make this purchase but when amazon finally dropped the price below 200 I grabbed it. I really wish they had put out a set but I'm sure they will now that I bought it separately.
1,not worth it,"the dvds were ruined by the glue from the pages..i couldn't watch the first disc when i looked at them all and they were all completely ruined. thankfully, i did get all of my money back with no hassle."
1,Another victim of the infamous GLUE issue,"First off, let me say that this review does not reflect the quality of the show, or even the content of the DVDs themselves. Unfortunately, I have become a victim of the GLUE issue that has haunted this set from the beginning. Several discs were marked with glue that cannot be removed, and several were also scratched because of the cardboard sleeves in the packaging! All attempts to remove the glue failed, and in fact only made matters worse! I have to admit that the ""Book Of Shadows"" packaging LOOKS very cool, but considering that the manner in which it is packaged DAMAGES THE DISCS, it is not worth it! I have already returned it for a refund! I would rather have a less cool package with all discs intact! You would definitely be better off buying each season individually!"
2,some of the discs,"Two discs so far have stopped playing then started again after a moment or 2, or the words kept comeing out with a stopped spot."
2,Not So Charmed,"The condition of the book was as expected but the in-page-pockets had ridges that rubbed lines across most of the discs. Several discs had glue spots stuck to them as well as odd discoloration that looked like bubbles under the label would- however this affected playability. I wasn't able to watch over 18 episodes at all, let alone all the others that would skip. Love the show, love the book idea, hate the disc condition & missing the final episodes of the series!"
1,DVDs do not work.,"The complete series in the book (but not the deluxe edition) was purchased for me as a gift. So far I have attempted to watch the first three seasons and so far every single disc has had problems. All of them either freeze or skip, making many of the episodes impossible to watch. I have examined the discs and none of them are scratched, though many of them appear to have small bits of glue on them. Even after careful cleaning the discs still do not play. Extremely disappointing."
5,gift,... for sister. exactly what she wanted; so if she's happy I'm happy. I don't know what else to say...
1,"Would have been a great Christmas gift but,",Initial shipment and the replacement both had the glue substance and scratches that have already been talked about in other reviews. This is still is a problem. I hope eventually all the faulty copies work their way out and I can pick this up for the girlfriend.
2,Disappointment,"Sadly I won't be purchasing from Amazon in the future due to the fact they don't address the Region area when we purchase from Australia, it is several layers down when you declare that you only provide region 1 product and by then I had the WII games and to send them back would mean the refund after paying delivery and return charges just arn't worth it, I will endeavour to sell them on ebay with full disclosure of the region. Charmed some dvd players in Australia will play them so they should be alright. Both were Christmas Presents for my grandchildren so I had to replace the WII games. Pamela"
3,Forceful but flawed,"Weldon's ""Trouble"" brilliantly captures how being engulfed in a powerful relationship can cause one's perception of reality to falter. It pulls this off in a way I don't think I've seen before in fiction. I found the book extremely engrossing and was amazed by how much Annette is transformed by the sad, sad ending: from a confident, witty writer to a simpering, apologetic, self-doubting and very ill shadow of her former self. I was disappointed, as others have said, by how two-dimensional the ""bad guys"" were; Spicer was pure, pure evil, and the other characters are either just as bad or total morons, making this book a bit too bitter to be believable. Nevertheless, it's absolutely worth reading and very hard to put down."
1,Just how stupid is Annette?,"Apparently so stupid that she ignores her own health care to the point of tragedy. Up to that point I had a bit of sympathy for her but she has no one to blame but herself for what she does to her baby. I had no sympathy for her from this point on at all.I can't believe I read the whole dismal book, something in common with those train wrecks you can't quite turn away from. But there wasn't one person in the book that was even likeable much less admirable. If this is the European Sensibility you can have it."
5,"Good price, Good quality, Not Ivory","Arrived in good condition. Good quality stock. Would describe the color as butter, not ivory. Much deeper color than ivory."
3,It was okay,"The picture shows a light beige paper, and the word ivory implies that it will be light beige. It was pretty dark. It worked for what I needed so I used it but it was not what I wanted."
3,Needed Vellum,"I thought this was Vellum paper. I guess I did not read the entire title of Cover Stock. Anyway, I used it for a project I had and it turned out okay.Thank you."
3,"Good, but overpriced","Liengme's guide to Excel is clearly written, has good illustrations, and contains a variety of useful examples. However, I don't know where they get $40 for this thin paperback. Orvis' Excel book is more complete and a better value."
3,Expensive for this price.,"While it would be useful for begineers, I find most of the concepts are raher short and simply presented. I think the amount of information given does not worth to that price. Especially, section regarding writting macros and prograaming are very limited and mostly in psude-code style which doesn't help you gain the experience of excel preograaming."
5,Practical use of spreadsheets,"Very helpful examples and good focus on fomulas, equation solving and statistical functions. Report writing section was useful as well."
4,"""That Dummy Talked To Me Last Night""","The '64 black and white horror film 'Devil Doll' is a decidedly unnerving feature that has the feel of an extended episode of the old television series 'The Twilight Zone.' The camera work is expertly done adding to an surreal feel to the film already established by the hypnotic voice of magician, sorcerer Bryant Haliday (the Great Vorelli) and his scary little possessed dummy Hugo. The storyline is also well conceived, highly original for the time and will hold your attention from beginning to end.One final accolade for this obsure all but forgotten film is the presence of the irresistible and exotic looking Yvonne Romain. She is definitely one of the most beautiful actresses of the sixties, why some intelligent producer or director didn't take her under his wing and make her an international star is a mystery to me.My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-."
2,"""Dead of Night"" it ain't!","I bought this in high hopes after reading very favourable reviews, wondering why I had not come across this film before as I am a fan of 50's/60's black and white horror films. After watching ""Devil Doll"" I realised how lucky I was - to avoid it for the past 40 years! It is pretty damn awful - the high points are the puppet's startling resemblance to comedian Jimmy Carr, and the hero's private-eye pal, who is a ringer for Sid James with a dodgy mid-Atlantic accent. This is awful - if you want a genuinely scary ventriloquist story from this genre seek out the Michael Redgrave segment on the ""Dead of Night""(1946) anthology. Now that's a dummy that really will give you nightmares."
3,Can I get the measurments of this thing please?,Very please with how fast this got to my house. Got a little nervous when I pulled it out of the box and tried to squeeze it onto my grill. I have a 200 series weber and didn't think I would have a problem making this cover fit. As it turns out it does fit but everytime i put it on it takes me 10 minutes because it's so tight and I don't want to rip it. It just would've been nice if there were some measurements when I bought it. Part of this whole thing is my fault I guess. Overall happy with the purchase.
2,water gets inside,"I love grilling and was happy to go for the grill cover that matches my grill brand, but I feel this cover is lighter then the last one I had on my old grill. The other thing and the bigger issue is that I have found water underneath the top of the cover after a rain storm, which scares me because my Grill is a brand new Weber which I am very happy with. It may rust quickly due to water getting under the cover."
4,An interesting way to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"In this movie, you will get the filling that the movie makers use the media as weapon and a speaker, they do it in a very delicate and sophisticated ways: ocumentaries, animation, satire and personal statments. This variety is a faithful reflection of the almost unbearable complexity of our feelings and interpretations, as Israelis, to the present reality."
4,Wonderful lesson about giving and taking.,"This is one of my favorite children's books to read aloud to the preschool lab at My High School. The children love it so much and have begged me to read it again and again. There are other great Silverstein Books, but this is certainly one of the best. My friend Miss Elliott, hates this book because she feels that the boy took everything from the tree to be selfish. She has dubbed it ""The Taking Boy."" I totally disagree with her because the tree was happy to give. When the boy wants money, the tree gave him her apples to sell in the city for a living. When the boy needs a house, the tree gave him her branches to build one with. Although a tree can't live without her branches, a person can't live very easily without a house. Even after the tree is nothing but a dead stump, she tells the boy to sit on her when he is tired. I am writing this review in memory of Shel Silverstein, who was just as generous as the tree itself."
1,I find this one really scary!!!,"For me, this book is about being so incredibly selfish that you would kill a friend to get what you want. It also seems to be about giving until you're dead. I fervently disagree with both of these sentiments!! I'm a little worried by all the reviewers who gave this book a ""10"". What are we teaching our children by reading this book to them? Thank goodness my two childrens' response to this one was confusion, and then, a dislike for the boy who never says ""thank you"". I would not recommend this book to anyone and would go so far as to suggest to parents that they keep it away from their children. I have actually taken to calling spineless, wimpy people ""trees"" because of this book. We should be teaching our children respect for themselves and the world around them . . . not blatant disregard and abject selfishness."
1,Worst Childrens Book I've Ever Read,"I am mystified as to how anyone could actually like this book, or read it intentionally to their children. It is truly awful. If you're interested in teaching your children life lessons using horrible, depressing examples, this book is for you. A selfish individual abuses and exploits an unselfish individual to death, then relaxes by sitting on her corpse. I would love to hear a psychologists take on the anger, resentment and passive aggression simmering beneath the surface of this ugly tale. There are many positive ways to teach your children about the value of gratitude. This is not one of them."
1,A book of exploitation,"This book reinforces dangerous gender roles - self-effacing, self-deprecating martyrdom of women/mothers and selfish, borderline-abusive behaviour by boys/men. It should not be removed from reading lists."
1,Despoliation is Good,"An appalling tale that teaches that exploitation to the point of eradication is the kind of lovely thing to give you misty eyes. A Main Selection of the Despoilers' Book Club: NOT printed on recycled paper! Perhaps parents feel that this story conveys how much of themselves they are willing to sacrifice for their children. But if, with such ideals, they create consuming little monsters like this kid, they're not doing their child or the world any favors."
2,Altruism,"Main Entry: altruismPronunciation: 'al-trü-""i-z&m;Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others2 : behavior by an animal that is not beneficial to or may be harmful to itself but that benefits others of its species"
1,This book can perpetuate disrespect for nature and women!,"Although the story has a certain charming loving relationship between the boy/man and the tree, the details of the simplistic analogy are horrifying. As the male takes and takes from the giving female in the story, she remains forever forgiving and accepting that her role is to give without question or limit. She is used, abused, sliced, dismembered, and finally cut down (read: killed), only to powerlessly allow the male in the story to continue to take and abuse. In a final insult, the man sits on the stump and somehow the reader is told that the (dead) tree is ""happy."" This story, may seem like simply a ""happy"" tale at first glance to many parents, teachers, and gift givers, but it is a masogynistic metaphor for thoughtless deforestation and violence against women."
1,We need to think more about this book,"The Giving Tree, seems like a lovely book and many people are not critical of it because it is tied to fond childhood memories. However, The Giving Tree is far too much about giving up everything for someone else at one's own expense. It is not a good lesson for children that everything they need will be given to them by someone who loves them, even if it means that person must lose part of themselves."
1,Laying on a guilt trip,"I didn't read this book to my daughter when she was a child, but someone gave it to her for her new baby. When I read it, it was all I could do not to take it away and hope that no one would miss it, because I don't want my granddaughter to have this story! It is just too sad, and little children should not be reading sad stories. Yes, it is a meaningful parable, but tiny children don't need meaningful parables. They should have joy, not deep thoughts.The mothers who love it probably have a secret martyr complex. When I read the review quoting the mother who said the tree is ""all mothers"" I thought this is someone who is laying the foundation for a major guilt trip later in life. The boy is selfish and never does appreciate the tree, and that's OK with the tree. But I'll bet that mother is someone who will tell her grown child ""look at all I did for you, and you don't appreciate me."""
5,A Mother's Love,Discriminating readers may find the boy to be quite selfish. Only a mother could love so unconditionally. For the permanent personal collection for the sensitive. A nice gift.
1,Huh?,"What is all this Christ stuff that people keep putting in their reviews of this book? Yeah, I suppose the book could be viewed as an allegory, but I think that's stretching it.This book is about taking advantage of and cruelly neglecting the one thing that sustains you and unconditionally loves you. It isn't a delightful tale, and it sure didn't warm the cockles of my heart. The Giving Tree is depressing and shows a parasitic relationship at its worst."
5,Book Review,"Shel sliverstein wrote many good stories, I find this one his best. It's not the story it's self but the memories it holds. When I was younger, my grandma has this book at her house. I would sit on her bed with my brother, her, and my cousins and read it. It's a book for everyone, and hopefully you'll have good memories after reading it. I've read and re-read it about twenty times through my life.\Leigh H.M."
4,the giving tree T,"this book is a classic, I bought it for my soon to be born grandaughter, remembering reading it to her father when he was young. After reading it again I think I will give it to my son and daughter-in-law, becuse when you are a parent you are __The Giving Tree."
5,A Goldmine!!,"An incredible sensitive book covering the subject of unperishable love. So inspiring that it makes one wonder what this world would be like without love. A love so great that it makes one wonder if the human race is capable of loving at this level. It is so well written that it is not only be meant for a child, but also for the adult who hence learns the most important lesson of giving love. The Giving Tree is so significant that it inevitably makes people want to weep, mourn, cry, and give all at the same time. A Truly inspirational book for all ages.

2,This book made me sad. Not recommended for sensitive children.,"I read this book as a child (circa age 6 or 7, maybe 8) and I could not understand WHY the boy was so mean and hurtful to the tree, or WHY the tree apparently didn't mind being killed and used. I just couldn't understand it. The story made me sad, and even angry. As I became older, I could see what the author was (maybe?) getting at - entirely selfless love and selfishness...both are not good paths to take. However, I don't think that pre-teen kids can really get this message, especially sensitive kids. I honestly think this is a book for teens or adults, not kids."
5,Great book!,"When I was going though some serious stuff as a kid my mother gave me this book. Thanks mom. You had a lot of patience with me, the only way I know how to repay you is by being a great husband, father, grandfather, serviceman and citizen. But mostly I thank you for giving me the faith to learn about myself... I Love You mom."
4,The GIv ing Tree,The Giving Tree is by Shel Silverstein. I liked this story because it was funny. I think it was nice. It wouid be good for first graders because the book is easy to read.
1,an awful lesson,The main message of this book is: Find a schnook who cares about you and take them for all they've got. An awful message for young children!
5,buy this,"it looks nice, the pages are of a high quality and while it might be a bit highly priced it's totally worth buying a classic piece."
3,Mankind's abuse of Nature,"I read this book as a little girl and I remember feeling alot of anger towards that horrid little boy. I loved trees as a child and still do and was also raised to respect nature. As I got older the message seemed to me to portray mankind as the selfish boy and the tree as mother nature who is thoroughly abused. Having just read about the last female rhino in South Africa being killed for her horn I can still see the value of the message as I perceive it. Hopefully other children will see it this way and not in other more negative aspects (the sexism remark, I can see where you're coming from but I choose to see it a different way, because I agree that would be horrible).That said this book never left me feeling very happy as a child and I hated it."
5,Every house must have a copy,"This book change my life, It teached me something that I knew, but never exercised, ""the act of giving."""
3,The Giving Tree,I like The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein because it had friendship in it. It was a good book. I liked when the tree gave things to the boy. I think that boys and girls my age would like it.
5,"The more you give, the more you will receive!","This book involves a boy and his stages through life with hisbest friend-a tree!Note to Teachers: Students can make an appleshaped cookbook with invented recipes. Also, students could make a timeline of the boy's life!"
4,"About ""The giving Tree""","I think this is a greatbook. In fact, anyone of any age could learn a lesson or two from the book (esp. adults). I think the moral of the story is worth every single cent of the book."
5,A classic,"I have known and loved this book for as long as I can remember, and I ordered this copy as a gift for a friend. Even though she is an adult, and this is a children's book, she was touched by its message of how to care for someone and be cared for in return...just as I have always been. This book is Shel Silverstein's masterpiece."
5,"Its a great book, with a great philosophy. Read between the lines.","The moral of the story is touching, its a great gift to give a parent."
5,made me cry with joy,this book amazed me at the way it almost was real. like a mother doing for her child. it was truly an outstanding book that i as a parent will cherish and hand down to my child.
5,Never forget!!,"My friend gave me this book when I was in the most extreme hardship in my life, that was, the divorce. I was exhausted by the fighting and struggles with my ex-wife. In such a time, I read this book and I literally got shocked. Every word in this book speared straight into my heart. I could not help asking myself if I was, or maybe both of us, really thoughtful to the partner? Did I consider giving anything to her not expecting getting any rewards? I felt this book saved my soul. Several years later, I got married again and resumed the family life. I will never forget what this book told me, that is, what the real love will be."
4,An Even Better Bargain with CD!,"You're on this page so you obviously know all about ""The Giving Tree."" If not, there are over 400 reviews here to fill you in. I would just like to add that I was pleased to find this version on Amazon that comes with the CD. What an excellent companion to a very popular book!"
5,A Most Favorite Book of Ours!,"I love this book sooooo much! I read it to our 2 young girls often (ages 3 and 4.5) and still get choked up when I read it. It is a simple book with simple words and pictures but has an oh so deep and meaningful message. I think our girls will understand it differently over the years and only hope they grow to understand and appreciate its message. I give this book to friends and glue a picture of our girls along with a dedication into the cover as I like to give gifts that are also special to us.If you like Shel's other children's works, I believe you will like this book as well."
5,Every Prodigal Son Belongs to SOMEONE,"Howdy,This review isn't so much to review the book itself--which I and my wife loved as children and love as much now--but to review the critics. Most of whom seem to find this an exercise which merely attempts to validate abusive relationships. Why give and give to those who keep taking? Why?We take the other side of the coin: Unconditional love. This is NOT a story about the boy. This is a story about the tree (the mother, the father, the wife, the husband, the whoever who has the strength to wait, to know, that love may not change anything . . . but it may . . . it MAY).But an opinion is just that. To those who found the book a validation for abuse, we sincerely thank you for making us re-examine our own point of view, even though we did not agree.Either way, definitely worth reading yourself . . . and then deciding if it is appropriate for your children."
5,Incredible,"The tree didn't think the boy selfish or cruel.All she knew was the feeling of complete joy when he was there.I think that all adults can see themselves in each of the characters.I had never heard of this book until one week ago and I was fortunate that the local library had a copy.I have read it to my granddaughter twice already.One more thing, the tree was not weak for giving to the boy...it is simply a shame that any old boy wouldn't have made her happy."
5,"The Giving Tree is simplistic, not complex.","The Giving Tree is a story of love, not a story of weakness. I compare it to a story of best friends. To the boy, the tree was his best friend, but the boy was greedy. The lessons you learn from this book are about not taking advantage of others and about giving rather than taking. For those who don't like this book, I think you are reading into the story a lot more than was intended by Mr. Silverstein. I think this story would be great to read when students or children were taking advantage of each other. The tree shows us that like a friend, it's always there. The tree also shows us that if you take advantage of your friends, you can lose parts of them that will never come back."
5,Everything a book should be,This is by far the most enjoyable book I've ever read. I remember this book from childhood but I bought my own copy this summer. I'm 20 years old and it still brings me to tears. A must-own for all ages.
3,"Not really a ""children's book""","The giving tree is about a boy who loves a tree and a tree who loves a boy. It is a portrait of how through the timeline of our lives we want different things. As the boy grows he looses his desire to play (it seems he looses his love for the tree as well)Yet the tree continues to love the boy and continues to provide the boy with what he wants - apples to sell for money - wood to build a home etc.... This story may appeal to many parents, but children will totally miss the point."
2,"""Like New"" more like obviously used","I purchased this book in ""like new"" condition. It had writing on the inside, including a stamp 'this book belongs to' on the inside cover. None of this was mentioned in the comments."
5,Awesome Service!,I love this book. It's one of my favorite children's books of all time. I received it fairly quicly after ordering it. And it was in perfect condition.
1,least favorite children's book ever,"Perhaps appropriate for discussion with an older child, but written and drawn for younger ones. Brings to mind cartoon Camel cigarette art drawn to appeal to adolescents. As a parable this story has power and merit along the lines of the song ""Cat's In The Cradle"" by Harry Chapin, but its presentation in a format for young children is totally inappropriate. This is a horrible, disturbing book."
2,It made me sad,"I got the giving tree for my birthday a long time ago, and my mom read it to me and i cried because it was about her. And for a long time all i could think of when i saw her was that she was a stump and that i took all her branches and i didnt even know. Sometimes i think about it still, even though shes dead.But I think that Mr. Silverstein understands the world, and so I give this book Three Stars!"
3,A story of motherly love,"The giving tree is a beautiful book which tells of the love of a mother for her son, using a tree as a symbol for the mother, who gives all she has to the one she loves. If you've never read this book, no matter your age, It's one you should look at, even if it's just reading through it in a book store or the library (it's a short book). This is a great book to give to your children to show them that your love for them will last forever, and that even when you've given them all that you have, you'll still be willing to give more."
1,Disturbing---and Not for my kids!,"I had reviewed this book at an earlier time, but think I was so disturbed by it and my feelings that I wound up deleting it. While shopping for kids' books, I read The Giving Tree and was so upset by it I couldn't concentrate further. Why?--would someone write this, publish it, and why do people LIKE it?? I would not read this to my kids (or any!)--and I'm a ""live and let live"" person. Yikes!I have the Cheap Rhinoceros book, somewhat entertaining. While Silverstein is acclaimed, I don't know that I can get into his writing any further...and WHY should I?(editted Sept. 2007)"
1,teach your child to be a doormat?,"I never understood the appeal of this book. The tree is used by the boy, who gives nothing back. What's the message here?"
2,its ok,i like the moral of the story.. but the pages with just a few words.. jesus! talk about minimalist! how are you supposed to keep a kids attention when all you are doing is turning pages and saying practically nothing.
5,Wonderful sad book.,"I know nothing about children's books. It has been many years since I had a small child in my family. This year we were blessed. When we were supposed to take a book to the shower, I asked several friends with small children to recommend a book. Everyone recommended this one. I was very surprised it was so widely known. I had never heard of it before. It is very sad. I'm not sure what would be a good age for the child to have this book read to them. The parent would have to judge that. One suggestion I would have. The author looks like a mass murderer on the back cover. I would definitely cover that page, as a parent. As the author-have a new photo taken. That one is scary!"
5,A lesson in love and gratitude!,"I give this book for EVERYTHING...baby showers, birthdays, congratulations, graduations, EVERYTHING. It's a PHENOMENAL book and love and gratitude, and I still cry whenever I read it!"
5,Good book,Came in fast in really good condition. This book is good for the kids . I remember reading it when I was young and now I get to do the same for my kids.
4,"Great book, many meanings","Though this is a kids book, adults will appreciate it's meaning and might even be reminded of people they know who are like the little boy in the story."
1,Talk about using and dependent. AWFUL story.,"Why anyone likes this book is beyond me. I never liked it as a kid, it always left me with an uneasy feeling. As an adult I understand why. This kid takes and takes and takes from the tree until there is nothing left. Wow. Lets teach kids to act this way. Brilliant. I threw it in the trash can."
4,Unselfish love,"I find the story the Giving Tree to be a tale of unselfish love. I know it seems as though all the boy does is take, take take. Maybe Shel Silverstein wrote this book to make us realize that sharing equally is what is important. I think the simple drawings are perfect for a not so simple lesson"
5,Thoughtful and Balanced Love,"I agree with those reviewers who described The Giving Tree as a brilliant book, one that teaches essential life lessons about love for both children and adults. To me the tree beautifully represents the maternal archetype giving unconditional love to her child. All goes well until the boy becomes a young man. Then the tree encourages the man to keep on taking past the point at which he needs to meet most of his own needs while learning to give more to others. At this point in the story the tree actually harms herself and the man by not setting limits on her giving and the man's taking. So while the first part of this book is about the joys of unconditional love, the second part of the book is about the perils of needing to be needed. This is a book about the importance of balance in love. Giving too much invites abuse, while taking too much results in unhappiness."
5,The tree that keeps on giving,"I've been reading this book for 25 years, hundreds of times when my child was young, and dozens of times since, to visiting children. It is now my book of choice as a baby gift, along with a tree that flowers each year on or around the child's birthday. Their own giving tree, that gives to them, and to the environment as well. Response to this gift has been amazing."
4,a great book,the book the giving tree is a great book to read.I would suggest this book because it teaches you a good life lesson. If you have kids I would read this book to them and I think they will learn a good lesson. Also this book might help you kids to not make some mistakes.
4,TheGivingTree,The Giving Tree was written by Shel Silverstein. I like The Giving Tree. It's a very good story. I love all of the books that Shel Silverstein wrote. Shel Silverstein was a good writer. My favorite book is The Giving Tree because it is about friendship.
1,Most disgusting book ever,"Mr. Silverstein has creasted the most despicable character in the history of literature. The ""Giving Tree"" must destroy itself so that others can be happy. What a wonderful message to indoctrinate your children. Do everything for some self-centered other so that you may be destroyed in the process. What ever happened to ""win-win"" or equality or pride or understanding. Awful! Run, don't walk, away from this tripe!"
5,Great Value,This was my daughters favorite book as a child. My daughter and I did not meet until recently after a 31 year seperation she told me of the joys and comfort this book brought to her. I started to search high and low for this book and found it here on Amazon. I ordered it and recieved a mint condition book. Imagine my happiness in seeing my daughters face when I presented it to her. Thanks to the seller. You made a great memory for us both.
2,disturbing,"My 2 cents: I actually remember being disturbed by this book as a child. Hadn't thought about it in a long time, but I actually felt a little upset and a little confused by the story. Seems to me the boy murders his best friend and then after killing it uses the body too. Who is the tree? I don't know, but it is a generous, loving being. The boy takes advantage of it as much as he can. This book doesn't deserve to be read anymore and children are better off not hearing this sad tale."
2,"Giving Tree, Rotten Boy",Many people love this book. I remember having a Sunday school teacher read it to us when we were little. Even then I thought 'That boy does not deserve or appreciate that tree's love'. It's a great lesson about selfless giving but as a kid that's not what I took away from it. To me it was a story in which she gave and gave and he took and took until she had nothing left.
1,I hate this book.,"I read this book once to my son. It is so sad and that little boy is so selfish that I was totally shocked. It made me cry. Who the heck needs a children's book like that? I would have to say that it is very well written, because it certainly packs a wallop. Make sure you read this first before you read it to your kids."
2,Not the right message for my kids,"I have to say, I don't understand the rave reviews for The Giving Tree. I think the messages in children's books resonate in their little souls for years to come. I try to give them an appropriately broad and thoughtful array. I'm not trying to get too pop-psych here, but, what's the message of this book? To me, it feels like it's ""giving up everything to make someone else happy is a good idea."" There's probably enough of that message in the life of young girls, especially. I'm sticking toThe Lorax (Classic Seuss). :)"
1,The Worst of Humanity,"This book is in no way, shape, or form a children's book. I bought it for my five year old, thinking it sounded like a good book. It depicts a spoiled, rotten, brat who can only think of himself. It shows the worst of humanity and doesn't depict the bad behavior as being wrong. To me it says that the destruction of our enviroment is not only OK but acceptable. I would not reccommend this book for anyone!"
1,1 star or 5 there is no middle ground,"You pick up the Giving Tree. You read it. You are touched. You think to yourself, this is a wonderful book! However, as you are finishing the last sentence, something starts to bother you. What was the moral of the story? What was it? you think to yourself. Is it, that you must give your all to the person you love? Is it that you should sacrifice everything you have to them? This train of thought becomes troublesome, and one of two things happen: 1) You realize that the book teaches a horrible lesson(or leads the reader to it unintentionally) or 2) You squash the bad thoughts and tell yourself that moral doesn't matter, and the story is about love, and don't think about it any more. Then you get on Amazon and write a 5 star review."
1,Incredibly disturbing sexist fable.,"This enormously popular book has a boy taking and taking and taking from a tree as he grows up, until he has killed the tree to make his house, and as an old man is reduced to sitting on its stump. And the tree is happy to have him sit on it?If the tree weren't always referred to as female (""she"" ""her""), this would be an upsetting enough book, suggesting that nature is there to take from without giving back. But since the tree is written as a woman, the moral is that it's okay to take and take and take from a woman to the point of destroying her, and she's supposed to be happy if you eventually come back to her when you can't enjoy life's other pleasures.Am I the only one who finds this incredibly disturbing in a children's book?"
5,My favorite.,"I'm nearly twenty & never tire of this story.I find that it teaches an incredibly important lesson, and brings me to tears to this day!I'm sorry some parents don't agree that their child should be reading something -gasp- not hunky dory and perfect, but this really should be a staple in ANY childhood library.Brings real life lessons into a fictional story.Excellent."
1,Inspiration - NOT !!!!! Selfish & ungrateful - YES!,"I am with the minority of reviewers who thinks the selfishness of this boy to take and take and take without gratitude or returning the favor is appalling! When I read this with my 5 year old daughter, even she could see how selfish he was. I am amazed at the number of raves - I would never recommend this book and find it miles away from inspiring - what should it be inspiring????"
1,I HATE this book,It is a sad and disturbing view of the world in which a selfish horrid little boy grows to be a selfish horrid little man and takes and takes and takes and takes and abuses a weak-willed tree with no self-esteem to death. If anything it rationalizes and supports battered women staying with their scumbag abusers. Children's book...right. Shel had issues.
1,My least favorite book ever...,"I used to work in the publishing world. I have four children. Because of my background and the number of children that I have, I have been gifted a few copies of this very popular children's book. It makes my skin crawl. This book is on the reading list for my childrens' school. When I read this book with them, I have to stop and lecture my children on what a true friend is. If a friend is willing to hurt you (aka cut off your branches only to later hack off your trunk) to make themselves feel better then you need to cut them out of your life asap. I am shocked that so many people love this book. It is one of the most disturbing and ridiculous books that I have ever read!"
1,Not for my grandkids!,Children don't need to get the impression that unqualified love is about one being sacrificing everything - right down to life itself - for the other's convenience. But most kids are smart enough to know that already. My main objection to this book is that it's so maudlin. It's not for my grandkids! They'd say yeccch! i only give it one star because there's no lower option.
1,Give until you die...?,"This story is not appropriate for children. The tree keeps giving and giving until it is a stump. Readers talk about that the tree simply wants to receive the happiness of the child/man, but in my eyes it is a one-way street. What does the boy/man give to the tree? I cannot see how this story teaches the lesson of giving and receiving. Being fond of nature I can see how the story illustrates how humans take advantage of nature as a resource (keep taking for one's own advantage). I am aware that people will not like this review since it seems like a lot of readers were brainwashed with this book as a child and perceive it as a fond memory. I can relate to that aspect. Please read it again and think twice about what lesson the book teaches a child.I received it as a gift, read it to my child and as I realized how this ""famous story"" unfolded I gave it away."
3,My Kids Turned This Into A Great Discussion,"I really didn't like this book as I read it to my second grade class but the discussion my children had after the story was amazing. Basically, my kids thought it was a lesson on bad parenting and selfishness. They thought if the tree didn't give the boy everything, he would have learned to do things for himself and that if a parent gives their children too much, they are going to have to provide for them forever and harm themselves in the process. What ever you may think about this story, it does teach many different lessons, depending on how you want to look at it."
4,great book,"I got this book for my son, he loves it. I don't always have to read it since it comes with a cd. Will get for my friends kids."
5,The Giving Tree is a favorite,A favorite book both as an adult and in my childhood. It is a great book for all grade levels and everyone can learn from the message.
5,Review for The Giving Tree,The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein is a wondeful children's book. It is warm and loving and has a wonderful message of love...by a boy for a tree and a tree for a boy. My children loved this book and it was a favorite for many years. I can't wait to share it with a grandchild.I highly recommmend it.
3,The Giving Tree,I liked The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein. I like the part when the old boy came out and rested on the stump of the tree. I think my mom and dad will like this book. It is a friendship and caring book.
1,Poor example for children,"I would never want my two boys to act like the boy in this story. Not only is he always selfish and grasping, the tree is given a female gender, thus teaching boys to devalue women, and girls not to value themselves. It is a dangerous message. If I were to ever allow my sons to read this book, it would be with the express purpose of explaining to them what is wrong with the story. I found absolutely nothing heartfelt or tender about this book."
2,The Hanging tree,"This book was enjoyed by our 5 year old Grandson, but not particularly a good choice his paarent said. Thisbook was also one read by our Grandson's mother who also did not like the content as it was rather depressingin her opinion. I went on your reviews so mixed opinions I am afraid."
1,The Giving Tree,"I am quite sure I would have given this book a very favorable review if I had ever received it, but since it has been almost two months since it was ordered and I have yet to get the book or a refund, I'm afraid the review is going to be quite bad. Maybe I should do a review of Amazon and Woody's Books instead of the book The Giving Tree."
3,Isn't the giving a bit one-sided?,"I remembered loving this before, but when I recently heard it read again at As You Like It, a local literary symposium, I was struck by how sexist it is!The tree is stereotypically giving *everything* she has, giving up her essence, to please the boy.Shel, stick with the silly stuff, you do it much better."
2,Puzzling...,"I had never heard of this book until I was a freshman in college, 14 years ago. My literature professor read it aloud to the class. It put a lump in my throat, but it also confused me. If this were a children's book, what message was it trying to convey to a child? Possibly that unconditional love is an amazing thing. Unfortunately, this book seems to teach an exploitation of that love rather than a appreciation and a reciprocation.I don't have children yet, though my husband and I are talking about starting a family. This really isn't a book that I would want to read to my future youngsters."
1,I wouldn't give it to a child,"If this book is supposed to be ironic (as some critics opine), it's a miserable failure, given the number of readers who take it literally and label it ""inspiring."" If it's not meant as irony, I find it frightening: real love means you give and give and give, even if the person you're giving to is thoroughly self-centered, takes your generosity for granted, never tries to see things from your point of view, and doesn't even bother to say ""thank you."" ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" implies that your love of others is grounded in respect for yourself. Neither the tree's behavior nor the boy's is worthy of emulation, and I would never give this book to a child."
1,Moral?,"This is a story about one pathetic tree, and one mind-bogglingly selfish boy. I'm shocked that anyone thinks this is a good book. The only moral I could find in the story was that it's a lesson about what happens to your dignity if you refuse to say ""no."" That tree had no idea when to cut its losses, and there's nothing redeeming about that."
1,Should be re-named The Selfish Boy,"I am the biggest fan of Silverstein, except for this book. The tree gives and gives selflessly and the boy takes and takes. The tree is abused by the boy in a sense, and he just takes it. It's not a message I would want to send to my children."
1,The Masochistic Co-dependent Tree,"I had to add another one-star review. This book makes me angry. I don't think kids have the sophistication to think about the relationship depicted in the book in much depth, at least not without the help of an adult, and I don't think most adults even think of this book beyond thinking generosity and self-sacrifice are good, so what's not to like? True, but blindly throwing oneself under the bus for someone who doesn't deserve it and is only exploiting you is foolish, damaging to yourself, and damaging to that other person. I'd be more inclined to use this book as a tool to teach pre-teens about exploitative relationships and respect for human dignity, both their own and others'."
4,great gift!,This is a wonderful story that I believe every child should hear. The emotion from the story is incredible. I read it to my son all the time. I would recommend this book as a gift to someone special in your life!
5,"A fable for those who love unconditionally, & their heartset","At the onset of my 33rd year on this planet I have ran into very few things that touch my soul to the point that this story does. It captures the kind of love I have tried to express most of my life, and the pain I have endured as a result... all in the hopes for that moment when it all seems worth it. Part a warning, part a heartfelt plea, and sentimentally true to the point of heartbreaking, it can't be denied... but there is an underlying honesty and a feeling of sympathy that ring so true that you can't help but feel love for the tree... Take it for what it is, part warning about giving too much or warning about the hurt you can cause others with greed... either way, a great life lesson can be learned in a simple package. More books like this are needed."
3,This is Shel's only good book,"It’s true! I’m not at all impressed with Shel's writings but this book is sweet; it’ll bring tears to your eyes, a sweet parent/child book; his ONLY good book in my opinion"
5,"overall, very happy",the book was in good condition - and much cheaper than when I ordered it so obviously Amazon went looking for the best deal for me.and it came promptly.
5,Perfect Condition and Great Price,Book is in great condition. My nephews are going to be excited to get this as a christmas gift this year.
5,"A ""Mother"" and Son Relationship","I personally cannot read the book without crying. It is a deep story about a tree's love for a little boy. The boy grows up and changes. The tree still loves the boy, even after he uses the tree for personal gain. The tree puts up with it until the boy grows old to the age of near death. The tree will always love the boy.There's a reason why this is a classic and why this tree is immensely popular. It is not about the story, but rather about the love of one being to another. Take it for what it is and enjoy it."
5,The Giving Tree - You Must Read It!,"I just finished listening to my 7 year old son read this book to me, and I was so touched, by the story it told. The unconditional love this tree held for this boy. It is so true to life. It also hit so close to home. We live in an area where there are so many pine trees, and they have become a nuisance for so many, us included, and so everyone in our neighborhood have been cutting these trees down, and now I see this in such a different light because of this book. I really feel bad, not to sound like I'm nuts, but these trees had so much to offer us, and we could not see beyond our selfish needs, and now they're gone and they can never offer us anything again.. I will never cut down another tree. P.S. - I can't wait to pick up another Shel Silverstein book."
5,A Must Have!,"This book is a must have for every child and adult. Considering this was the first book I ever read all by myself, it has a special place on my bookshelf and in my heart. I almost forgot about the book until my 8th grade English teacher brought us outside underneath a tree the day Shel Silverstein died. I'm pretty sure I was the only one with tears in my eyes. After that I decided I had to get my own copy, because I lost my original."
5,The Giving Tree,"I love this book. I remember reading it when I was younger and it just reminded me of how my parents feel about me and my siblings. This tree gives everything that she has to the child that she loves, and wants to keep giving when she has nothing left to give. It is a story of unconditional love. This is one of the best children's books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading."
5,The Giving Tree,The Giving Tree is a wonderful story. I used to read it almost everyday when I was a little girl. It touched my heart. It's a story that every person should read. It's warm and very touching.
5,Beautiful book for all ages,This wonderful book teaches the joy in giving and how we tend to take all these for granted! Silverstein has expressed the complexity of relationship between parents and children in such a simple form that is easy for all the understand.
3,childrens book?,As an adult I do see that this tree loves this boy as a mother loves a child. However if you are buying this book for a child think again. I have a 7 year old who has had this book since he was 4. He has always hated it. Kids don't want to be forced values. He also doesn't comprehend the message. An emotional read as a parent for myself but not for my child.
1,The Giving Tree,"I am VERY disappointed in both Amazon and the supplier for this book. I never recieved this (The Giving Tree), or any of the selections I ordered and was asked to review...I did write the dupplier and though, through the tacking, I said it was delivered on a certain date and time, I was home at the time and I recieved no package...I wrote the supplier, but they only asked ofr the tracking number which I gave them and have never heard from them again...a disappointing experience, that makes me hesitate to order from here again. Regrets, Dennie Boettcher"
1,A really demented message,"Ugh! This books sends a really demented message about unlimited sacrifice by parents for their children. I actually think that the message is harmful to parents, who seem to think that the more they sacrifice, the better. Can't you do right by your kids and still be a human being?"
2,Dangerous Message,"I suppose I malign ""The Giving Tree"" at my own risk, but here goes. The message in the book is not one we can afford to give our children (or adults) anymore. Our environment is suffering such serious degradation from our taking (its ""giving""), and a book like this only reinforces a selfless, limitless idea of nature where the environment can give and give to support not only our basic needs, but our greed and needless desires, without real life consequences. The message is great, but the the vehicle used to convey it is no longer appropriate for a nation and world that needs to wake-up to what's happening on this small planet."
1,What a sick little book!,It depicts a tree as a sentient life form that gets cut down for the profit of an evil (capitalist) little boy that forgot the simple pleasures playing in the trees branches.Yuck! Someone gave this to our 3 year old and I disposed of the book before finishing the story. I have half a mind to write a story about a giving tree. Something about trees are not sentient and have no souls and reveal their true beauty when they get cut down and made into something useful.
5,Good book,This is another book I purchased for my great granddaughter. Kaydencce Le-ann loves it and we read it everytime she visits. I recommend this book to anyone with young children.
5,Amazing Book!,This book is heartwarming and reading it to my two year old son never seems to get tiring (for him either)! It's a wonderful book about sharing and we will both treasure it for years to come.
5,The Giving Tree,I have read this book to my elementary school students for years. The story is so lovely and so sad. Its great to read before Mother's Day because we compare the tree to our mothers - who give us everything.
3,I have grown up too much.,I used to love this book so I bought this for my children. I only liked the story but the condition of CD was horrible so I do not want to recommend this one.
1,Not a good example of Silver,"I have the version of the Lone Ranger's faithful stallion from the 1970s toyline and I have to say I am very disappointed in this version. No articulation or saddle, this is a truly sad piece. Hopefully someone will put out a line of Lone Ranger toys similar to the well done line put out by Gabriel Toys in the early and mid 1970s. And we will not only get a better version of Silver but his heroic rider as well as Tonto and Scout."
4,"Good CD, But Not As Good As The Others","Sounds of Blackness is well known for R&B/gospel hits such as ""Optimistic"" and ""The Pressure"" as well as many Negro spirituals. The group's first 2 CDs were the ones that brought them the most fame. In their third CD, ""Time for Healing"", they somewhat stray away from what they usually sing. It is possible to mistake them for a straight-out R&B group. There are great hits like ""Hold On (Change is Coming)"" which is my personal favorite. They also do remakes like ""Love Train"". I really wish that Ann Nesby was on this CD, but she decided to go solo. Oh well. That's how the music business is, I guess! Even though the group loses many great things that they had from the other CDs, it is still a great one, and I recommend it to any Sounds of Blackness fan."
5,Imaginative and fascinating!,"This covers fascinating questions, biological (e.g. predation), physical, chemical, and theoretical; it also shows you how scientists think about problems, and how they use their imagination, as well as powers of observation, to propose answers. Illustrated with clever visuals of possible aliens--I would have liked more of those. Morgan Freeman is always great, and the interviews with scientists were suprising and fun!"
4,"Please, Spanish Subtitles!!!","Is wonderfull, Is great realization this serie. New theory in universe. Please. Spanish Subtitles!I need this for me happy my life. Thanks.[...]"
4,Thought Provoking...,"I missed this episode when I could have watched it for free. I find this whole series to be very interesting and thought provoking. However, I find it equally difficult to pay $2.00 for a show that you can watch re-runs of on television for free. Amazon, shame on you for charging for these shows instead of providing them for free to your prime customers."
5,THE UNIVERSE,I LOVE THIS SEASON; AM WATCHING OFTEN; I MAY MEMORIZE WHAT I AM LEARNING... GREAT PRESENTATION; THANK YOU VERY MUCH
5,Amazing stuff-Makes you think-God is good,Morgan Freeman is a terrific presenter. The magnitude and diversity of the universe underlines God's creation. Thank you for offering this to your membership. It certainly is thought provoking!
4,Great and knowlegable,Love this TV series. It is very informational and it represents all side of the question in each of its episodes. Not any one view is put out there. Very good for people who what to know the answers to the hard questions and for the dreamers.
4,Cultural Manifesto!,"This Mind boggling effort brings out the juice that has been rooted deep down by every percussionist (atleast good ones)in this era,Master Percussionist Trilok Gurtu and Gang,rock the steamboat wicked,by fusing Jazz and Funk Rhythms with African,Indian,Balinese and other forms of Indigenous beats, Great vocals on all of the tracks by the african singing sensations,Kai's slaps da' the groove out of his bass,and Shobha Gurtu is as exuberant as always!,As many fans are lucky to have this album released under Polygram/Blue Thumb for easier accessibility than his earlier album ""Khatak"" which went totally inaccessible in asian countries(esp.South East),this release should get more hands on it,else there is always Amazon.Com! Album Scores (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)"
3,A novice's view....,"I don't really follow ""world"" music. Honestly, this is the first bit of music I've experienced from the genre. I bought it because the reviews on NPR were really good. I was not disappointed. Gurtu's music is rich in sound and rhythm, and is an enjoyable listen. I was, however, surprised how prevalent the influence of ""western"" pop music is in Mr. Gurtu's music. I don't suppose this is a negative thing, but in my first foray into the genre I expected to find something wholy new and refreshing and instead I found many of the same things you find elsewhere."
2,Looks homemade,"This is really a weird workout video. I fast forwarded through almost ten minutes of talking before the workout began. What was there was challenging and different - basically plyometrics with some arm moves, but not much of it. There wasn't much substance to this video, and it looks like something a neighborhood teen would shoot with her friends in the front yard. In fact, that may be what happened."
3,Nothing Earth Shattering!,"This tribute to John Lee Hooker is filled with stars from across the pond such as Jack Bruce, Gary Moore, Jeff Beck, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Mick Taylor and Clem Clemson. Hooker's daughter, Zakiya also puts in an appearance on the discs opening track. While there are some excellent performances here including ""Bad Like Jessie James"" and ""I'm Leaving"" the disc suffers from the inconsistencies in style and qualities that often plaque tribute discs. On the bright side, the disc contains a 4 minute 56 second, previously unreleased track of ""Red House"" featuring John Lee Hooker and Booker T. Finally, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this disc is being donated to the John Lee Hooker Foundation. Buy it for the few gems and help the foundation in the process."
4,Good lineup,I enjoyed listening to different interpetions of Hooker's work from various artists. I think Gary Moore's touch on Serve Me Right To Suffer was great. Peter Green on Crawlin' King Snake was a nice touch. Of course having Hooker himself on Red House was worth the price of the CD.
2,Very disapointing and BORING,"This review is based on the so-called ""total body"" portion of the DVD set. (I'm not sure how they get off calling it total body, considering it's a leg-lift video, w/about 24 total pushups and some crunches.) I bought this DVD b/c I wanted an introduction on video to pilates, and based on the other reviews, I expected it to be great. After purchasing this and spending [$$$] on the resist-a-ring, I was expecting a really good workout. Not only were the exercises and the video boring, but the workout could barely be called a workout. This is probably a good video for people who are just beginning to work out, don't belong to a gym, and just want to do very light exercising. I did not even see the majority of the poses and moves that are discussed in The Pilates Body by Brooke Siler. As far as the resist-a-ring, I felt like I was using Suzanne Somer's Thighmaster! Rodney Yee's Power Yoga is a much better workout - no additional equipment needed!"
5,How they lived...and died,"A fine selection of Weegee's unposed, spontaneous vignettes of life in the city, at least, as it was in the 30's and 40's, equivalent of today's TV ""fuzz and the wuzz"". His accompanying commentary, unghosted and punchy, mirrors the b/w images; snappy, to the point. The paper stock used here is cheap, but then, these photos usually appeared in the morning paper...in a time when there were newspapers."
1,Photo reproduction is terrible,"Beware that if you are looking for a book with info and a decent representation of Weegee's photography, this is not the book for you. I actually thought it was a bootleg photocopied book. The images you can print from your $50 home printer would be 90% better. The text in the book is what gives it one star... buyer beware"
1,Da Capo should hang its head in shame,"This Da Capo paperback edition of Naked City is an abomination before the Lord, an atrocity that deserves a jail sentence if nothing else. The whole reason to buy a book of Weegee's work is to marvel at the great black and white photographs, which in this shoddy, shambolic printing -- if you can call it that -- is not remotely possible. The photos look like Xeroxes, circa 1970. This is the worst book of photographic reproductions I have ever seen and I can't believe the powers that be at Da Capo are so hungry for profit that they would issue this garbage with their name on it. I have one of the Aperture Weegee collections and the reproductions are superb. Give this one a pass and don't waste your bucks as I most surely did."
3,Kindle Version a little dark,The Photos in the Kindle version are a bit muddy but the book is well worth owning for anyone interested in history and photography. I will post samples from the Kindle version.
1,You'll Be Sorry!!!!!!!,"OK, I've learned my lesson. With so many negative reviews, everyone can't be wrong. I have purchased literally hundreds of books from Amazon, and I like Amazon very much, but this was the worst piece of @#$%$#!! book I have ever purchased from them. How dare they charge $17.50 for this amateurish reprint! I knew it was a print on demand book (the date I ordered it is printed on the back page) but I didn't think it would look like it was printed on a Xerox machine from the '70's that was running out of toner!! The photos are washed out and undiscernable. I'm hoping I can find a beat up copy of the original somewhere. I really would love to have this book. Oh, and BTW, shame on Da Capo Press!!. I own many of their wonderful reprint books on music. My respect for them as a publisher has dropped 80 points!"
4,Reprint of historic photobook from the 40s,"This is a small-format (non-coffee-table) book containing a representative selection of Weegees typical photos of New York tragedies (mostly) of the 20s, 30s and 40s, together with his own cryptic comments. Not to everyone's taste, but an iconic social document of the place and times."
4,Works well with Dragon Naturally Speaking,"So far, working as good as the headset mic included with Dragon. This was a eight dollar mic from Wal-ly world, so price was right.Yes, you have to hold it close to the mouth (3-5"") for dictation recognition, but that is expected. It is lightweight and has an on/off switch for quick ""mute"" function if one desires.Not bad for the price!"
3,needs an update,"This video has not been updated or revised since it was released ten years ago--and that video was a reprint of interviews conducted by Lifton in the late '80s. Some of the material has been disproved, and, honestly, Mr. Lifton is not that engaging a narrator. However, to those new to the JFK assassination investigation, there are some critical things that will be introduced: the direction of the headshot; the probability of a pre-autopsy surgery to skew the autopsy's findings; this mishandling of the chain of evidence; and the autopsists' own credentials. Beware, some of the photos are gruesome if you've never seen the autopsy photos before."
2,not quite as advertised,"For what it is, the light is good but it's not as powerful as advertised and there are features missing such as the dual power inputs. The overall construction of the light is pretty cheap and I won't be surprised if this light doesn't last a year. It was bought to be used on a cattle ranch so I doubt it lasts very long. Overall the light is fine but since it is not quality I was expecting, I am disappointed in my purchase."
1,"Not 10,000,000 Candle Power",Ive seen 10 Million Candle Power & this is not 1/2 of what it should be. My 3 Million is stronger
4,spotlight,"Hello I like my spotlight, but I sent a question on what is the procedure on charging the spotlight. Should the Spotlight be turned on or off when charging and have not yet received a response from anybody.Steve"
1,False advertising,I bought this flash light hoping to get what I saw in the picture. What I got was a previously returned box with with the wrong product
2,Big Light - Short Battery,"I really love the look and the sturdiness of this flashlight. It's hefty and gives off a huge bright beam of light. We have used it for hooking up things behind the TV, checking the water softener in the dark corner of the garage...and for quick uses it's fantastic. That's the good news.The bad news is that the battery lasts about 15 minutes, 20 at the most. You also can't run the light while it's plugged in. There are those times when you aren't in the middle of a power outage, but just want some extra light...no such luck.I wouldn't recommend it or buy it again. I'd go for something smaller that will last longer."
1,its not what you expect,"too much money for what u get. in print it looks like a good piece of equiptment to have, but it only last at full charge for less than 12 minutes. i have already send it to the trash can where it belongs."
2,Ouch,"Well, the stuff keeps electrodes in place -- too well for me. As several reviewers recommended,I spread a very thin layer on an old set of electrodes. I let them dry for an hour before placing the them on my back. After the treatment, it took a lot of painful work to peel them off. The skin underneath was raw and a day later still irritated. I've been using my TENS for a couple months. This is the first time I've had any issue with irritation. Oh well. I'm back to buying new electrodes."
2,would have liked something less tac,it was good at first but when i realized how long i have to wait before each use of the product it seemed crazy. im not gonna wait 2-3 days by then i've used up to 4 new electrodes. it eventually burnt my skin which has taken forever to heal becuz i use my electrodes daily and will use them in the same spots. Def no fun ...this started a horrible cycle of having to keep sanitizing my scars so they heal but it's gotten pretty big the area which is most of the areas i use....
2,Not 200 rings. beware!!!!!!!,I agree with the other reviewer. This is a set of two rings not 200. It is very misleading.Feeling very ripped off.
3,Mediocre,"Craig Larman's intro (he's not the author) states that visual explanations are the most powerful. True enough. The author doesn't seem to agree. The illustrations are unenlightening from the get-go, and the text explaining them is often obscure. Add to that that the author's English isn't really very good, and you end up with a weak presentation. I'm not sure why many other reviewers are so enthusiastic. UML isn't particularly hard, and oughtn't to be made hard. I'd hoped to use this book to teach UML but will keep looking."
1,Why?,"My one star does not represent the music on this disc (that would be 5), but rather the compilation itself. If I were you, I would go out and buy the best of the Police (Every Breath You Take - The Singles) and the best of Sting (Fields of Gold) CDs.As a huge fan who owns all of the Police and Sting albums, it's hard to advise people to only purchase ""greatest hits"" collections, but you'd be better off w/ the 2 CDs than this one.P.S. The Message in a Box complete recordings of the Police is amazing."
3,a difficult compilation,"I didn't buy this CD after listening to my friend's. The Puff Daddy version of ""Roxanne"" is just disgusting, and it's too much trouble to program a CD player to always skip that track. Also, given the enormous amount of wonderful, wonderful things the Police and Sting have put out, it would be impossible to put all of ""the best"" ones on one album, especially given that each of us has a different opinion of what ""the best"" songs are."
1,lowest common denominator....,"The Kids in the Hall once said that Greatest Hits albums were for old ladies and little girls (paraphrased). But if you take two acts who already each have their own Greatest Hits album and stick them together to make a single Greatest hits album, then who is that for? Vegetables? The mentally disabled? The hearing-impaired? Seriously - if you're thinking of buying this, I'm willing to bet that there's probably one song that you reeeally reeeeally want to own. Do yourself a favor... look around and locate either ""Every Breath You Take - The Singles"" or ""Fields of Gold - the Best of Sting"", and whichever one contains your magic song, buy that instead. If you're a music fan, you will probably wind up wanting to own more once you've done that, and if not, you'll be just as happy as if you'd bought this bit of rubbish."
5,one of the best albums there is,"i have been a long time fan of sting and the police but never got round to getting any of the albums, just the singles, yet when i saw this i knew it was a must buy!! it has nearly all the great hits and my all my personal favs, if u just like his music but never got the albums buy this, you'll find yourself singing along with songs u didnt even know he wrote and probably love any u hadn' already heard. if long time fan though this probably falls a little short of what ur looking for. only criticisms are 1)get the european version 3 extra songs inc. ""7days"" one of my favorite sting songs 2) puff daddy's version of ""roxanne"" shouldnt be on the album, it should be somewhere on mars"
2,A bad mix,"This album does not work. On the surface, it seems like a good idea. Two great sets of music on one disc, but no. Despite including the same front man, The Police and Sting are just too different. They produce a completely different mood. When I'm in the mood to listen to The Police, I am not wanting to listen to Sting and vice-versa. If it wasn't too diverse as it was, to make this albumn completely unplayable, they've included an R'nB re-mix of Roxanne at the end. What were they thinking? Argh!"
3,A Very Good Collection!,This compilation of Sting & The Police is very enjoyable. But it does not containtheir hit King of Pain. What's with that?
3,"The police ( sting,copeland,summers) ??? puffy combs",This is a great cd however a cover such as roxanne 97 has no place on this cd. I was going to buy this but when I saw that track I knew that I would not enjoy this disc because the last track. I would be skipping over that track every time it played it is a real shame to have such great music on a cd for it to end with ( yeah-yeah-what-what-roxanne97 ).
4,The old sting music makes it nice,With sting (the main singer in the group) it makes it nice to lisen to it.
1,Too Much Static and a Bad Connector,"Stay away from this product. I'm returning mine ASAP. First of all, the USB connector has to be *fully* seated before it works at all. My silicone shuffle case has a thin layer on the USB end, enough to make it not activate the Transmitter. I removed the case to verify this and just pulling the connector out the barest fraction of a millimeter broke the connection. Given the choice of using this product (leaving the shuffle ""naked"") and keeping the case, I'll opt for keeping the case.Secondly, when it was connected, the sound quality was awful and the constant static waves made it unlistenable. I found several empty patches of airspace, so interference was not a factor. When not being annoyed by the static, the sound quality was very poor, sounding as if the speakers were stuffed with cotton.I have an older fm tranmitter that costed $14 that I bought 2 years ago that works better than this $50 POS. Avoid at all costs."
1,Don't waste your money or time on this one!,Even after removing the radio antenna on my truck the signal was full of static on every frequency. Obviously an inferior product.
1,Sound quality sucks!,I got this at the Apple store for $49.95. The sound quality sucks. I hear a whine and anything with some bass emphasizes it's beyond the limits of the shuffle/FM transmitter's capabilities. I'm returning it to the store tomorrow.
2,Screwed.,"I bought this with the expectation of low quality and short life, so I can't say I'm disappointed. I got about 1 year of use from this thing before the internal wiring started to get goofy. The cigarette adapter functions very hot and the digital display goes crazy. Now, there is no function. So, obviously, this company can not be trusted to make quality products. They are lucky it didn't start a fire."
4,Excellent,"I bought this shortly after buying my first generation shuffle and I loved it! It only just stopped working a few weeks ago, and given that I used it almost every day for nearly three years I think that's a pretty good run. I'm just sad that they don't seem to be making them any more."
1,Useless!!,"This is the worst product of all time. The sound quality is execrable even when there is no fm station anywhere near the frequency you've chosen. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
4,Two Cute Pre-Codes,"Loose Ankles is by far the better film of the two. It features a wonderful cast, of whom only the lead, a very young Douglas Fairbanks Jr., is a dud. He is, however, lovely to look at. Reliable Warner character player Eddie Nugent is absolutely wonderful as a cheeky gigolo and keeps the picture moving. Alice White does nicely in The Naughty Flirt and is the main reason to see the picture, Myrna Loy does not get to do much. Recommended for hardcore lovers of early talkies."
2,time/technology marches on,"It's nearly impossible to write a book like this that isn't dated a few months after it's published, and this book is no exception. This would be fine if the book were a little more technical or specific, but it's really just a broad overview of the basics of building a computer in 2005. I would have rated it higher back then. Perhaps a new edition with an inclusion of more up to date technology, speculation on impending technology's impact, or treatment of more advanced concepts such as overclocking/temperature management/bios tinkering is in order."
5,Still an Excellent Resource,"I have just built my third PC and still find this book very useful. By now, I do not need to consult it every minute, but I did on my first build (about a year ago) and it was a total lifesaver then. Now it serves as a resource when I need to refresh my memory or when I want to ""checklist"" my build to make sure I have not forgotten something.The book is extremely well laid out and very easy to understand. It includes pictures where they're useful and takes a truly step-by-step approach. Even though computer technology changes pretty fast, I think anyone could still build an excellent computer using this book.If the authors update this guide, I will absolutely buy a new one. But for now, I'm sure I'll be referring to it on any new build I attempt.Thanks for the great work folks!"
4,Great for 1st time builders,"If someone is looking to build a computer for the first time, this is probably the best book they could pick up. It goes through everything you need to know in a way that is clear and easy to follow. With this book and a screwdriver, anyone can build a PC.For those with more experience though, this is more of a reference book. I've done several groud-up builds, so there really wasn't much in here that I didn't already know (although it would have been great a few years ago when I built my first PC).This is one I've started recommending to friends who are interested in building their own PC so I won't have to worry about getting the ""what do I do now?"" and ""I don't know what I did!"" phone calls."
1,Too Old & General,"This book is 1.out of date,2. Poorly written from a technical stand point. I purchased this from Amazon, and promptly returned it. There is much better books on this subject on Amazon."
1,"Hate to have to agree, but I can't use this anymore!","I gave Palmolive Eco Gel a good chance, but after continually cloudy glassware (which I never had before with ""regular"" dishwasher detergent) and now a gunky white film on the bottom of my dishwasher, I'm done with it. I don't want to risk damaging the appliance so I'm switching back to regular. Sorry to do this because I always try to use eco-friendly products, but in this case it's something I'll have to live with."
1,if you like random white stuff on your dishes... go for it,left a white residue all over my new dishes ... not thrilled to say the least... this was the first and will be the last time I buy this brand... buyer beware..
4,Works well enough,"While the ECO Palmolive may not work as well as the mainstream (and less environmentally friendly) products, it does a reasonable job and it is far superior to the 7th generation liquid dish detergent (Note: I find other 7th generation products to be great). I do not have a problem with residue that others noted - it might be a difference in water, how hot you have your water heater set and/or model of dishwasher. Also, the picture doesn't match the product (at least for the default product that comes up when I first search)."
1,Without a Dishwasher,"I don't own a dishwasher. I didn't pay attention to it being for dishwashers. The dishwater was greasy and had no suds at all. The experience was so bad, I needed to know if anyone concurred with me, I was surprised that so many had a worse experience than I . Even though I rinsed the dishes well, I still feel grease on my hands. This is truly a horrible product. All of us cannot be wrong. I am just glad I had no dishwasher to ruin"
1,Don't Buy!!! Spare yourself the hassle (and I'd give it ZERO stars if i could),"I used the Palmolive Eco dishwasher detergent and it left all this white residue all over my dishes! I had to hand wash with an abrasive sponge and it was very hard to get off. I have to spend a few minutes on each dish, scrubbing vigorously to get them clean. I won't be buying this product again and I'm sorry I did in the first place.This ""Eco-friendly"" detergent is causing me to waste so much water and it contains chlorine bleach...how is that eco-friendly?I'm sure they had good intentions in making this product, but this is just bad stuff!"
1,Terrible--always leaves a film,"I'm having the same experience as others. This product always leaves a film on dishes no matter how much or little you use. One or two extra rinse cycles are always needed, and I've had to hand wash some items that still had a film after extra rinsing."
1,white residue,"trying to be eco-conscious- bought this bottle.i have the 'citrus apple splash' version. it's terrible.i'm glad it's 'better' for our rivers and streams but it is a blatant lie to have put 'cleans to a sparkling shine' on the label.i've used this product on three washes now. i, too, have had to rewash by hand due to a white residue left on every single glass, utensil and plate. it's not all that great at cleaning the dishes either- the original dirty-dish remnants are still on plates and spatulas.a poor purchase."
2,Leaves a nasty taste,"I just used this for the first time today and when the load finished I grabbed a glass for water. I'm glad I did, because it brought it to my attention before putting all my dishes away that it left behind a soapy taste. I didn't really see any residue like others here have reported, and maybe that's just because it was the first time I've used it. I also didn't see that it left dishes dirty, which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. That said, I'm not using it again. Running the dishwasher with no soap now, and hopefully that'll take care of it. Ew!"
1,Even the interior of my dishwasher is covered in white residue,"Not a good product. Not only does it leave a white residue that completely covers my dishwasher and dishes, but it has also crusted the detergent reservoir AND doesn't even get the (pre-rinsed) dishes clean."
1,This Will Not Save You Money or Time!,"Please listen to the negative reviews on this site. I am so furious. I just finished handwashing a whole stack of dishes that have piled up because this detergent DOES NOT WORK. In fact, I had to soak the dishes to remove an odd film that was left of them after using the product! Steer clear! Other eco options may be more expensive, but you will make up for it in water and time. Now if only I could determine what to do with the rest of this bottle..."
1,Worst thing ever!,"Even if it is ""eco"" considering having to rewash the dishes and trying to rinse off the white crud left all over them I'd say the waste of water isn't ""eco"" enough to make up for it. Terrible stuff. Don't waste your money or you too will be scraping white nasty stuff off your dishes that aren't even clean even when rinsed before loading."
1,Dont waste your time or your $$$,"This stuff left my dished with a white residue and the food that it was supposed to clean off, leaving me with more to wash off by hand. I regret buying it and I hope others don't make the same mistake."
1,Clogs dishwasher,"For a month, we couldn't figure out why our Whirlpool dishwasher refused to drain after the cycle ended. We assumed that the unit was going bad after rechecking the drain hoses, taking out the spinner to try to find an obstruction, etc. After reading the reviews for this product on Amazon, we switched back to our old detergent, and sure enough, the dishwasher started draining properly every time. Probably should have realized that the Eco detergent was at fault straightaway, but I've never had this happen before with any other brand or variety."
1,"Dishes seem OK, but dishwasher coated in film! AVOID FOR SURE!","Although the dishes don't seem to have the white powder on them, it is all over the inside of the dishwasher itself. The detergent cup is coated, the rinse dry cap and surrounds are filthy white, the tines inside the dishwasher are coated with the film, etc.You run your finger anywhere inside the dishwasher, or up and down a tine--and it turns white from the powdery residue.We're going to contact Palmolive to ask for our money back (THEY SHOULD GIVE US EXTRA FOR THE TIME, ENERGY, AND IRRITATION)--and go back to Cascade.Note: A couple of variables here. We do a light wash, non-heated dry, and have hard water. I can only imagine what a heated dry would have done!We're now going to try the tip in here about the vinegar wash; hoping it will get the dishwasher clean! (Our dishwasher has directions on how to do a vinegar wash for the utensils and plates, but we'll run IT without anything inside.)"
1,"Yep, this stuff blows.","My wife came home with this junk because she is always out to save the whales. I am online right now using Google to try and figure out how to get this white residue off all our glasses, dishes, and silverware. That is how I found these reviews, and wanted to chime in. Not only does this junk leave the white residue on everything, but she has had to rewash every load and the dishes are STILL dirty. I'm going to try the Vinegar trick the other lady mentioned. The only other thing we are wondering is....All our silverware is also VERY scratched up. Tiny circular scratches that you can't even feel, but look terrible in the light. Was NOT there before. The silverware in the drawer that has NOT gone thru the dishwasher with this new detergent is still perfect. ALL the pieces she has now run thru 3 times trying to get them clean are all scratched up. So, shouts out to Palmolive ECO who caused us to use 3 wash cycles on one load of dishes and ruined half our silverware."
1,Pure Bleach!!,"I bought this item at Kmart, as we were running low on disherwasher detergent and this was the closet ""eco-friendly"" detergent they had. Got it home, ran a load and next thing I notice is my house began to smell like pure bleach. I was furious! The product claims to be safe and eco-friendly, but chlorine bleach is TOXIC!!!!! I could not find the ingredients on the bottle besides the statment that it was free of phospates! After smelling the bleach, I looked it up online and sure enough it contains chlorine bleach! DO NOT BUY THIS POISON!!!!!!!!"
1,I wish I could choose zero stars.,"Horrible. It doesn't have phospates in it, which is why I bought it. My checkbook needed a break from Seventh Generation. It does have bleach, and I didn't even think to check for that, because of the ""eco"" label. I wish I could post a picture of what my dishes look like after being ""cleaned"". White, crusty film on everything; my utensils look like they've been licked. It's disgusting. I have to rinse EVERYTHING with vinegar and water after a cycle. So, I'm wasting water and that's not quite ECO-nomical or ECO-friendly."
1,White residue over everything,"Since this product was the same price as a non-eco-friendly detergent, I thought I'd give it a shot.I wish I'd have stuck with the regular stuff. This leaves a white powdery residue over everything! Ceramic dishes, plastic cups and baby bottles, silicone nipples, metal silverware... I tried more detergent, less detergent, but it leaves it every time. So gross. I had to rewash everything by hand."
1,Class action lawsuit.,"Given the disturbing amount of people who have used this product and had the same terrible issues, we should form a class action lawsuit against the company. I don't know what they put into this stuff. But it is damaging to the dishwasher. It completely ruined some fine dishes. Great Value brand soap left some residue but barely. Cascade is still number one. Palmolive is garbage. I took some and squirted it into a pan to try and wash it by hand. This stuff not only did nothing at all for the dirt. But it left an obnoxious odor that wouldn't come out. I took Dawn dish soap and scrubbed with a pad. Rinsed it, and the smell was still there. Normal soap doesn't do this.STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."
2,"No film here, but not all clean either","I did not have the issue with film that others reported, but only half of the dishes got clean. Peanut butter does not come off the knives and if there is any food product or grease on the dish, it's still there when the cycle is over. So, the glasses that had juice or water were fine and the dishes that had cereal or toast crumbs rinsed off were clean. The rest had to be re-washed. Which is not very ""eco."""
4,"No problems, no residue","This is one of the FEW detergents I can use because we have a septic tank with well water. I dont have any complaints about a white or any kind of residue left on the dishes, maybe its because I have well water?The price is disapointing here on Amazon, because for half the price I can get it at our standard grocery store (0.572 cents per ounce rather than .11 cents here). Everything works differently for everyone.. maybe this is just made for well water & septic tanks but doesnt promote it that way..?"
1,This product has ruined our 1 year old dishwasher!!!!!!!!!!!,This product should be taken off the market as it gums up your dishwasher so bad your dishwasher doesnt work at all with soap scum everywhere. After several rinses with vinegar it still has the soap scum. We have been washing our dishes by hand and may have to buy a new dishwasher!!!!!!!!!Yes I am very upset about this product as we never had any problems using Cascade.
1,Going to go out of my way to never by from Palmolive again.,This product is absolutely terrible. It doesn't sud at all. It smells like bleach not lemon. And yea- like everyone says- it leaves residue everywhere. They must have gone out of their way to make a product this bad. Gives eco a bad name.
1,WORST THAN AWFUL!!! MY WARNING TO ALL!!! #1 MOST ENLIGHTENING CRITICAL REVIEW!!!,"I WOULD RATE THIS PRODUCT IN THE NEGATIVE NUMBER COLUMN IF I COULD!!!I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS ALLOWED TO BE SOLD!!! It has left a white, EXTREMELY hard to remove, film on my bowls and glasswares, etc.! I have NEVER had this problem EVER before with ANY other dishwashing detergent!!!!!!!!!!!! I went back to Walmart and got their extra large size Cascade with Dawn & lemon scent dishwasher detergent again which I NEVER had a problem with... ever!!!!!!!!!!!!THREW OUT ALL (3) BOTTLES I PURCHASED HERE!!! BEST TO LIMIT LOSSES! I LITERALLY HAD TO REALLY, REALLY, REALLY AGGRESSIVELY SCRUB OFF THE WHITE FILM LEFT ON MY DISHES, BOWLS, GLASSES, ETC. MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES TO GET THE WHITE SCUM OFF LEFT BY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!PS) I HAVE A WORKING WATER SOFTENER..."
1,Terrible product,"I used this product for a while, until i noticed that it was coating certain portinos of my dish washer near the drain hole and the detergent dispenser with a hard white crust that doesn't wipe off. I stopped using it as soon as i noticed, but it's taking forever for this stuff to wear off, and bits of it come loose at times and clog up the dishwasher's drain, which i then have to unglog by hand. Do not buy this product."
2,"Eco Friendly yes, product does not perform","I have to agree with the majority of the reviews on here, I purchased this detergent in hopes of doing our small part of saving the environment. However, the product consistently leaves white residue and minimal food stains behind (that other detergents can knock out). I give this product one additional star simply because it is eco friendly. As a dishwashing detergent it is terrible, the question you must ask yourself is doing you want to save the environment or your dishes? The research I conducted about detergents with phosphates states that phosphates increase algae production in fresh water. I was under the impression phosphates were destroying our water systems, thus I should have conducted my research prior to purchasing this product. I will be purchasing a different detergent next time around."
1,Use only if you love white residue!,"I had the same experience as all these other people. Palmolive Eco Gel left a white residue all over my dishes, which was very hard to get off. I have never had this experience with any other dishwasher detergent even though in the past I haven't been particularly picky about what I used. Believe the bad reviews!"
1,Awful product,"I bought this on a whim last time I needed dishwasher detergent. The scent seemed nice, it was cheap, and eco friendly always sounds so great in theory.Over the past few weeks, I've been so unhappy with the way my dishes were coming out. It took pre-rinsing dishes in the sink, using the heavy wash cycle, and then sometimes still a little bit of cleaning afterwards to get my dishes clean. And sometimes even after this, there was still a weird white film on them. I thought maybe our dishwasher was having an issue, but then I realized this problem started when I started using this detergent.I'm not one for wasting, but I might just get rid of the rest of this detergent. It takes me more effort to clean dishes while using this stuff- I end up almost hand washing them in addition to running them in the dishwasher."
1,S-U-C-K-S,"Any and everyone do yourself a favor and listen to all of these reviews. I too thought it was my dishwasher so checked every cycle- no problems, water temperature- no problems, etc., same issue with everyone else with the white filmy residue left on all dishes, silverware and glassware. Palmolive should either take the appropriate steps to make this item efficient or remove it from it's inventory altogether."
1,leaves tough white film on dishes,"Suddenly our dishes had this nasty white film on them. I had no idea what was going on, since the BF is the one who does the dishes. Good thing I checked Amazon for reviews so we didn't spend money on fixing our dishwasher! However, now our dishes have this stubborn white film that can't be washed off completely, and forget about the grooves and engravings on the silverware... I think those will be gunked up forever! We can only hope that the 4 times we've used this in the washer haven't actually caused damage to it! I really wanted to move towards ""eco-friendly"" products, but not when they don't work! Now I've learned to seek out reviews of these eco products first before I waste my money and potentially ruin appliances! Back to the Cascade, I guess..."
2,Not The Greatest!,This does not clean well at all. It left residue on my dishes and food still stuck to them...and I pre-rinse everything really well before putting in the dishwasher and I still had not so clean dishes. I would not recommend this product. My dishwasher and dishes even starting smelling stale and not so fresh after using this for about a week...it never had with any other product. Never using it again.
1,Oh god......why.......,"My dishwasher is running with this Eco gunk in it as I type this. I randomly looked up reviews for it and now I'm horrified at what I'm reading. I used this stuff a few months back and did indeed notice a very bad white film on ALL MY DISHES AND POTS that WILL NOT COME OFF. I had no idea what it was or if I should be worried. I switched to Cascade and it didn't take the residue off so I had no idea what it was. And stupid me bought this Eco junk again at Walmart not putting 2 and 2 together that THIS is the crap that caused my white nightmare. OH LORD WHY! WHY!!!!!Well, when this cycle is over I am going to do what others suggested with the white vinegar and I'll update this and tell you if it works.UPDATE: Well the vinegar didn't work. NOW WHAT?!"
1,Terrible! Do Not Purchase!!!!!,"It claims to be ""ecologically friendly"", but how can this be when you have to run your dishwasher 3 EXTRA times to try to remove the white film that it leaves? On top of that, you have to drive (your non eco friendly automobile) back to the grocery store just to buy some real dishwashing liquid. This is exactly what I had to do.I almost never leave product reviews, but this product deserves one. It is a complete waste of money and time. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!"
1,Worst ever!!!!,"This is the worst dishwashing detergent I have ever used. It left a thick white chalky substance on both the glass and plastic and plates. I called the company and they did send a refund for the product they suggest that I used it wrong...huh? Then they told me to run white vinegar after to rinse off the chalky stuff, why would I do that I'll just go back to sunlight. I got this one because it is suppose to help the earth. I will look for another brand and also I do NOT have hard water or excessive minerals. Just don't want another busy mom to have to rewash all her dishes by hand in vinegar, life is just to short. They should take this off the market."
4,Narration flows right along,"This author knows how to write. Completely fascinating story, told at a good level of detail, covering 50 years in 400 pages. One weak section, toward the end. Overall, strong.I don't know oil, don't know Arabs or the Muslim world. This book gave a good historical perspective, a sense of how we got to this crazy place we're in now. Saudis cozy with our Texan Prez, Iraq in chaos, Osama hating his country (Saudi Arabia) and the foreigners who (he thinks) corrupted it.The book lacks depth in covering Bedouin society. You get that it's REALLY different, but you don't get a comprehensive picture of how Saudi's are. Aside from that, there's not much wrong. Excellent material, well told. ****"
1,"Fascinating story, poor account","Brown's book suffers from a lack of good editing; accounts are out of sequence and disjointed, whole paragraphs are repeated and participants confused. The tale of ARAMCO and the Kingdom's transformation is a remarkable one that Brown fails to do justice."
3,Insightful,"I found it be a little difficult to follow, especially for those without a good understanding of Middle East History. Overall, however, the book was well researched and very insightful."
1,tabloid writing,this book is distinguished only by the sheer volume of the number of errors the author has managed to include. For this he deserves a five star rating
2,"Sketchy, biased and unreliable",from my personal knowledge of what has been happening in the oil industry and in the government relations as i was in the middle of it from 1951 to 1990 I can tell you that this books is incomplete and biased......
4,Math textbook delivers,"Well, there isn't much I could say about this textbook, but it did do its job. The textbook had examples and explanations for every section, followed by exercises for practice.I will say though, it was nice that the book is relatively thin compared to other calculus textbooks I saw my friends lugging around. The textbook was precise and to the point."
1,Poorly Packed,"The skillets arrived in a timely fashion, but when I opened the box they were very poorly packed. Several scratches were on both skillets from moving around in the box unsecure and one of the handles had become completely detached from the skillet."
3,TOOO Big,"I bought it for the RV but I would have to haul it in a trailer! hahahaha.Seriously, looked like okay quality, but way too big for the two burner RV stovetop. I returned it and it was processed timely."
1,Mine was definitely defective,"I guess there is a first for everything. I got this frying pan recently and in 50+ years of cooking have never had a pan do what this one did. Had it on my smooth cooktop, was heating garlic in oil and heard a crackling sound. I thought the bottom was wet. I wiped it off with a paper towel. Also, when it heated it buckled and rocked on the cooktop and again, after extreme ""cracking"" noise I picked it up off the heat and found the bottom of the pan had begun to literally crack OFF (you know that ring design you see on the bottom)the pan. I was glad I did not leave this pan unattended for even a second. Never had anything like it happen to me EVER. Of course, I returned it. And included the pieces of the bottom of the pan."
3,A difficult task,"I imagine it must be very hard to pick up someone else's work midpoint and try to bring it to the conclusion they intended. Kevin Andrew Murphy certainly gives it a good try here, and I'm not at all sorry I finished the book (which I had been eagerly awaiting for years. There is no huge let down here, no great frustrations. But while there are hints of Jo Clayton's voice here, and I enjoyed visiting with her characters again...this is a pale continuation of the series...the depth is, sadly, missing...and I suppose, in a very real way, that is the most fitting tribute to Ms. Clayton possible...her work was finished, but her spirit is clearly absent."
4,Best available Sandy Denny compendium,"This si a nice collection of some of Sandy Denny's best pieces intermingled with some harder-to-get but still delightful gems. I had most of this on original LPs & it is nice to be able to put such a collection into the cD changer, but as with all anthologies, there is something missing in terms of overall coherence & at times the order of the pieces is a bit jarring. That being said, if you have room for only one Sansy Denny set, this is probably it, and you may find yourself out looking for more after giving this collection a thorough work-out."
5,A great voice,"Sandy Denny, one of the greatest voices in music. A collection of her songs spanning a long, but sadly a shortened career."
1,Who Remastered This?,"Never in a million years did I think someone in a studio somewhere could make Sandy Denny sound like Melanie after inhaling helium. The cover is about the only good thing to this disc. The songs sound flat and shrill, especially ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"". Painful to listen to. Let Sandy rest in peace and keep your vinyl records!"
5,A timeless talent.,"There will always be musicians out there who you know are at the top of their game, masters of the craft who should not be missed -- and yet you never really find the time to explore their musical gifts. In my case, my sin of omission was Sandy Denny, whose music I knew solely through her work in two incarnations of Fairport Convention -- a passing acquaintance at best. Now, through the two-disc anthology No More Sad Refrains, I finally know just how good Denny is.The anthology isn't really for Denny enthusiasts. Most of them will already know this music by heart. But for those of us newly come to her altar, this set is a treat -- an excellent introduction to some truly magical songs and a truly gifted voice. And with 34 tracks totaling 2 1/2 hours of music, there's a lot of learn."
2,Not a good introduction,"I am one of those who wish to pick up a book and be able to work with the technology in matter of hours, and this book is not the right one for it."
4,excellent,"I can not understand what the preveous reviewer (Adum Haunis) intends to say. I think these are very simple and clear examples. However,I can not contact this author! ! ! ! I have many questions, but this author does not reply ! ! ! So,4 stars. If you have reverese opinions, please tell here (to Adum)."
4,a lot of knowledge in a simple and few words,"I am working on my IBM XML exam and had to study ""Professional XML"" and other books.I found out there are two types of computer books1) one type can tell you the same things in few pages(200-300 pages) and (of course in cheap price) without wasting your time and money.2)second type will tell you the same things in 800-900 pages with price upto 60$ and size that will make you afraid even to pick up the book.(mostly ""Professional series"")this book is from the first category. the author has done an excellent job to simply the understanding of how XSL,XSLT and XSL:FO works. what are different ways to do the same thing, whats the adv/dis to do them.I got a chance to borrow it from my public library.you may not find solid examples(only fragments) but believe me you wont miss the concept what the author is trying to teach at that point(he will use picture, fragment or whatever).so here is the summary, if you want to save your time and money, pick this book."
2,Not for the rest of us,"Unless you have a resturant, this magazine is useless. I got it thinking it would cover Personal Chefs, but it is all about gas applences. Pass on it, it's boring too."
1,Waste,Total waste of money. I finally got my first issue and it had 4 recipes and about 10 pages on gas equipment - THAT'S IT!!!!! Save your money - that's how to make a profit
3,Not the best but still pretty good,"Don't get me wrong this was a descent book - I am just basing the rating on all the other Elvis Cole books that I have read (all of them) - now it was good - let me start by saying that. Just not up to par to the rest of them. The best ones that you should check out are Lullaby Town, Monkeys Raincoat, Voodoo River and La Requiem (the best so far) - but you should still check this out if you love Elvis and Joe Pike, awesome freakin characters by the way. Still give this book a try if you love the others. Cool characters and cool series."
1,Not unabridged,This audio book was not listed as abridged. That's why I bought it. If I had known it was abridged I would not have purchased it.
2,Very disappointing,He talks to his cat. Sub-plot with the girl friend gets more space than the mystery.
3,Three Stars Yet Again,"While Sunset Express was a decent comeback from the previous book in the Elvis Cole series, the dreadful Voodoo River, it still doesn't match up to Robert Crais's better, earlier work. The storyline is pure OJ Simpson---a rich Hollywood type is accused of murdering his wife. Elvis is hired by the man's slimy legal team to help get him off. Meanwhile, a female cop is accused of planting evidence to make the man look guilty in the first place.It's a plot that's both predicatable and somewhat stale. We know the outcome of the book from page one and there are so many cliches about devious lawyers and crooked cops that the excitement level is just never very high. While fans of the series will enjoy reading more about the adventures of Elvis Cole, this one if far from the best."
4,Elvis Cole does it again.,"I guess this book was recently re-released, because for the longest time, it was the only Elvis Cole novel that I couldn't find in any book store. Well, now that it's out, it a pretty standard Elvis Cole novel. And that's fine by me.Without giving too much away, a rich and famous man is accused of murdering his wife. He's hired by the defense to look for dirt on the women who arrived at the crime scene, and investigate other materials. Elvis has his doubts on some of his leads, and he uses his investigative clues and his partner, Joe Pike, to figure it all out.Though it gets somewhat outlandish in the end, this book provides a good mixture of intrigue, detective work, back-stabbing and more. As usual, it's a fun fluid read, and I recommend it."
4,A good read but not his best,"I've read all six of Crais' Elvis Cole novels starting with The Monkey's Raincoat. With but one other exception, I rate the rest of Crais' novels as 5 star reads (the other exception being Stalking The Angel, I dislike story lines where the hero is constantly being put in danger because of some fool). Sunset Express came close in the number and quality of great wisecracks but the denouement was somewhat unsatisfying (again probably because I was comparing it to his 5 star works). Elvis and Pike are the most intriquing detective characters I know of and I look forward to reading the next Crais effort."
3,Easy Entertaining Read,Elvis Cole is hired by a famous Hollywood lawyer to investigate a police officer who found evidence that led to the arrest of the lawyer's client. The client is a wealthy restaurant owner. As it turns out Elvis is being used by the lawyer. There's lots of things going on and Elvis eventually discovers the truth. His girlfiend Lucy comes for a vist and Joe Pike gets on board the investigation. This is not one of the better Robert Crais's novels but it easy to read and entertaining. ( B).
3,Mediocre,"This book is fast reading although it took about 150 pages to get going. The author balances the intertwined stories very well yet appears to do little to make the characters that he has created seem real. They are cardbord cutouts with little substance to them. Although not great, it certainly does qualify as a fast and easy read even though much of the story is quite predictable."
4,One of the better cole novels...,"Written around the time of OJ Simpson trial, it is nice to read one where the cops are the good guys. Even Greta Green Way shows up...shades of OJ. This is a good book, which built nicely on the novel before it. We learn more about Elvis' love life and he is growing here...I really enjoyed the mystery, the characters, and always, the humor. THe book is a fine and quick read."
3,below par for Crais,"I'm a fan and I think I have given all the other Crais books I have read 4 stars - this is the first time I have dropped to 3. Why? Well despite the usual strong characterisation, wit and charm, the plot here is thin and far too obvious. So you enjoy the journey but most things are signposted and expected so you are not sufficiently surprised.Elvis (with minor support from Pike) is asked to check on an LAPD officer to validate corruption claims as part of a high profile murder case. After a while Elvis realises all is not what it seems.....And while this is going on Elvis is trying to impress the lady in his life, but not everything is working out there either.....So the usual ingredients but when baked together the final product is okay but not outstanding. Unusual for Crais but this is still very readable."
4,Sunset Express,"Robert Crais is an excellent writer. Everytime I purchase one ofhis books, I can't put it down. RWH"
3,Decent,"I'm a big Robert Crais fan but I think he can do better than this one. While it was an exciting read, it was not very original because it draws too many comparisons to the OJ Simpson case. For example, you have a very wealthy man with lots of connections who hires a dream team of a defense counsel to represent him after getting charged with murdering his wife.Again, there were some good dialog and action scenes but the storyline was not very original."
1,Color is not Ivory,Ordered the paper for printing my own wedding invitations. The weight was nice but the color is not Ivory. It's much more dark and yellow than a true Ivory. I uploaded a picture of the product next to a white index card and an ivory envelope for comparison purposes. Returned the product for that reason.
4,Good Cardstock,"I used this cardstock for my wedding invitation inserts. I looked for awhile for bulk ivory cardstock, and this was the best price I could find. I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a little darker than what you think of as ivory, but it does print nicely."
3,Not cardstock,"It's nice paper for the price, but there is absolutely no way it's 110 lb. I needed thick, sturdy cardstock and this is almost like regular paper. It feels more like 70 or 80 lb. It's unfortunate cause it really would have been perfect."
3,Only For B-Sci Fi Movie Lovers,"If you don't like cheesy B-Sci Fi movies, then you will not like this movie.The ""Atomic War Bride"" is an interesting movie. Made in Yugoslavia, it's an interesting take on atomic war. The title sounds silly but comes from a couple who happen to be getting married when a war breaks out. Thus the cheesy title. But the movie is made with the groom more as a target for the plot rather than the bride.There are some truly funny scenes in this movie. For one, the ""groom"" is sent to what looks like a one day boot camp. They practice camouflage by sticking a tree branch in the top of their rifles. Interesting. I think we laughed more than we took this film seriously.The trailers are good for anyone interested in Atomic War.And ""This Is Not A Test"" is a neat film about strangers who get caught up out in the open when Atomic bombs start to fall. Interesting character studies here.The film is worth the cost as long as you don't pay over $10"
4,Great for cartography students,"I am a GIS student in the natural resources field. I had to use this book and was not all that thrilled with it, but that is because it is about cartography. I reluctantly admit that us GIS-ers need to know cartography, but we don't have to like it. For mapping, this book is a good one. It covers the essential points to topics such as dot, choropleth, graduated symbol and other thematic maps. It covers how to make them and what symbols should do for the reader, as well as how to design for your map reader. It also covers mapping theory and how it relates to typography, symbol placement, visual hiearchy and the use of color."
4,I remember it well,"Ah, I was 10 years old when these games were played. I remember going to bed after the 10th inning in game 6 because I wasn't allowed to stay up that late, so I missed Pudge's HR. I'll never let my mom forget that!I enjoyed this book immensely, even though I was rooting for the Big Red Machine in 75. I recently purchased the complete DVD box set of the series, so what I did was watch a game, then read the chapter in this book about that game. That made it very enjoyable, and I even recognized the author's recollection of the announcer's comments. It was obvious he watched the tape of the games as he wrote this book.I throughly loved this book, and any baseball fan should read it. Sadly, I lost interest in baseball about 1979, but this book took me back to by preteen years. I wanted to strap on the glove and swing a bat after reading it. But, I'd probably break an ankle. And a wrist. I better stick to reading and watching... :-)"
4,A NICE BOOK ABOUT THE 1975 WORLD SERIES,"THIS IS A BOOK DESCRIBING THE REDS AND THE REDSOX DURING THE 1975 WORLD SERIES. IT COVERS EVERY AT BAT AND GIVES US A BIT OF INSIGHT BY VARIOUS PLAYERS ALSO. WE HEAR FROM SPACEMAN LEE, DICK DRAGO, DON ZIMMER, ROGER MORET AND MANY MORE. THIS WAS ONE THE MOST EXCITING SERIES, HIGHLIGHTED BY GAME 6 WHICH CARBO AND FISK DID THE HEROICS. THE AUTHOR DOES A NICE RECAPPING THE SERIES AND I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS."
1,the title of the book is inaccurate,the 1975 red sox did not restore america's passion with baseball.the New York Yankees rise to glory from 1976-1978 restored not only the passion of new york area fans but the rest of america. Doug Hornig tried to establish a falsehood and give credit to the Red Sox of 1975 for restoring America with its love of baseball. But as all baseball fans know (as well as major league baseball officials know) as the New York Yankees go Baseball goes. To Try and argue that the Red Sox of 1975 ( a losing team who did not win a world series title) pulled major league baseball out of its dulldrums is a farce. The New York Mets of 1969 did much more for Americas love affair with major league baseball than the Red Sox of 1975 could imagine. It is obvious Doug Hornig is just trying to ride the coat tail of the 2004 Red Sox ( a good team but not a great team) and con not only the fans of Boston but of America.
5,Is it real Clear Truth or Dirty False - indifferently.,"The main discuss lies now in sphere of the original or not this book is? Some scientists prove, that it is falsification. It seems to me, it's right, but many of us have forgotten, that this book had the purpose to set the main targets of Judish policy for a centures. It is indifferently, who wrote this book - if Judish solves their problems according plans and methods decribed in Protocols. By the way, one great Russian writer, Bulgakov, said, that manuscripts haven't burned, so the forbidden to sell this book increase the interests for it and gives the good advertisement fot those, who think: ""Why in Senate of USA 90 per cent not Blacks or former Englands or Irish, but Judes? Who headed the World now and, perhaps, the author of this book was the Real Learned Elder, seeking for centuries?"" The real value of this book we would know in nearest future."
1,Hate is out of date,"As a WASP who holds Stocks in several Banks and who has fought racisim for many long years this book has no redeaming value out side of historical study of the negativity of Antisemitism.To be an Anti Semite,Anti Woman, Anti Black, Anti Asian, Anti White, Anti Gay etc. has long been out of date.Why waste your energy and time on trash when you can look at the Amazon list and find books that enlighten and not let hate fester in your mind and soul.A waste of the tree used to make the paper it was printed on."
4,Focus is on King Tut more than Ancient Egypt,"Ancient Egyptian history covers many thousands of years. That is a lot of history to cover in a children's history book. Most of the children's books focus on the larger themes of ancient Egypt. ""Inside the Tomb of Tutankamun"" is unique in that it tightens the focus and concentrates on the life of just one pharaoh and the subsequent discovery of his tomb in the early Twentieth Century. This is a well written book and the illustrations by John James are first rate. If you are looking for a book about Tutankhamun this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for a general history of ancient Egypt, look somewhere else."
5,Still using this DVD 11 years later,"I started using this cardio DVD in 2000 and it was integral to losing my freshman 15. It's a tough workout even for someone accustomed to aerobics, which is pretty hard to find in the aerobic DVD world. I've used it frequently over the last 12 years and it continues to be a challenging aerobic workout that I do a couple times per week.It's a nice mix of high intensity/high impact cardio, lower intensity/low impact cardio, a few moderate weight-bearing cardio routines (4-limb) and a few step routines and is customizable up to 8 scene selections. Lots of the cardio segments include ""plyometrics"" or jump squats which really amp up the difficulty level.The instructors are great, the workout is not boring. While it is challening even for experienced folks, it could easily accomodate less fit users as well - just don't do all the jump squats and moderate the movements a bit."
3,Surprisingly intense and high impact,"In my opinion, all Firm workouts are cheesy. Even though for the most part the actual exercises are not that bad, the instructors are super boring, monotonous and bland, especially in comparison to what else is available on the market. The music is often barely tolerable, but every once in while there is one that despite all of that works you hard and leaves you feeling good afterward. This one, I think is one of those. The variety is very good alternating between cardio without and cardio with weights (I wouldn't call this 'sculpting' though) burning calories at a pretty good rate (according to my heart rate monitor). The part that was definitely bad, was the stretching. In an early 80s kind of way the stretches are just rushed through, I had to ignore it and do my own. I noticed the poor quality of stretching in other Firm workouts also."
4,Decent cardio workout,"I have several exercise videos and this is the third one I bought from The Firm series. I found this workout to be pretty challenging and I think I am in pretty decent shape. (I ran a half-marathon several months ago in two hours.) However, I did not like how this video was advertised as being able to create thousands of different workouts by picking and choosing different parts. If you choose to customize your workout, you pick 8 of 17 chapters, but then you end up with a very short workout! But if you do all 17 chapters, the workout is 63 minutes, 49 of which are cardio."
1,Like a parody of a bad 80th aerobics video,"The only good thing about this video is it's comic relief. It really, really reminded me of the parody of an 80's aerobics video that Drew Barrymore did on SNL. I have and like the cardio sculpt series, and I picked this up for some variety. The cover makes it look like it was produced post 2000, but the video itself is early 90's at best.But maybe I'm just unappreciative because I'm not coordinated? This was very dancy and most all of the instructors seemed like former Texas cheerleaders.Really, really bad."
5,Excellent Cardio Workout from the Firm,"I did this for the first time today. I ordered it from one of the amazon marketplace sellers and received it within 3 days. I got a good deal by buying used and it plays just fine. What I like about this dvd is that you can fast forward the commercials they have in the front, which sometimes you can't do on other dvds. The workout itself was pretty simple to follow. I did mess up a few times, but I'm sure after a few workouts I wil have it down pat. The music was fun and motivating. I prefer the Firms from this era versus the newer Firms because the music was so much better then. There were no high leg presses, which I think is a shame because the high leg presses would have made this a more complete workout. I was going to buy Super Cardio as well, but having played the dvd, I think this has most of Super Cardio in it."
3,Chaotic cardio,"It's a cardio tape with fast and chaotic excercises. There is a fast change of equipment: little chair, medecine ball and weights, so you end up skipping reps. It will make you sweat but you'll feel annoyed because there is no clear direction of what's coming next. The weights' section is so short that you should not count that as a weight routine.They should have just openly said that there is step aerobics and used a real stepper instead of these small chairs.They were trying to create a domestic atmosphere but the carpets and the mirrors just made it worse."
4,Good story but too short,I have become a fan of Baxter Clare and have read all three of her books and look forward to the next. Although I enjoyed this book very much it seemed to end too soon. In Ms Clare's other two books the plot took a little longer to unfold with much more investigation and back tracking after going in the wrong direction with several different suspects. This story figured out who was the suspect and then the rest of the story was how to nail them. Not a lot of mystery in that. I must say I was happy with the developement of Frank's and Gail's relationship and glad to see Frank's character moving on with her life in the right direction. I look forward to the 4th book and hope we won't have to wait too long.
5,Instant fan of Baxter Clare,"I became an instant fan of Baxter Clare and her character Lieutenant Franco from the very first line of the book. The suspense and drama that keeps you turning the pages until your through was a big plus for me. When I start a book, I like to finish it in one sitting if possible. I also enjoyed the continued relationship between Franco and Gail and would like to see Ms. Clare put those characters together permanently in a future book. I've read each book involving these characters and would purchase again."
3,Stupid,"I really enjoyed the previous L.A. Franco mysteries and was excited to find this one. I was so disappointed with it, though. The book deals more with the occult and less with the case. The idea of Frank and Mother fighting lifetime after lifetime is about as cheesy as it gets. (I will defend myself by saying that I enjoy science fiction and fantasy books. Just not in the middle of a mystery.)On the other hand, I enjoyed the development of Frank and Gail's relationship."
1,Why?,"Why do they release things like this?The Knack in 2001? Good lord! There are about 10,000 preformances and videos than need to be on DVD more than this sad little exabition, even many KNACK circa 1979 Performences/Videos would be welcomed."
3,High-energy but not Necessarily Live!,"I quite enjoyed watching the Knack mime to a new recorded track, as the performance captures the fun and excitement of a live Knack show. The newly recorded songs sound great, the band looks good, and the set is full of energy. I may have to get the audio CD as well, since it sounds so good! I like watching Berton Averre's fingers fly over the fretboard, and the man is such an underrated guitar player."
1,never received it from supplier,"I paid for it and waited and waited and waited and I am still waiting 2 months later......?""?"
2,Disapointment,"After hearing the One Nation Under House compilation under the Twisted label I was expecting something different. The new Stay Gold remix is great but the rest of the album didn't leave much of an impression on me. It's overall very down tempo and the flow is very choppy with empty ambient tracks. Unfortunately I found it very boring. Good for background music maybe but I doubt that these tracks will ever come up in the clubs, especially with the trend to harder house music."
1,Their later stuff is way better....,"Not only is their later music much better, but who wouldn't take issue with ridiculous ideas such as this one: ""Mohammad Is Jesus."" What? That's not what Mohammad said about himself, and it sounds nothing like what Jesus taught."
3,a lil bit of cool,"This album is in one word COOL. However it is not consistent and sometimes a little bit dorky and thus the rating. Tracks 7 and 11 are my personal faves and serve as excellent driving music, especially with a sub. Worth checking out if you like their other work."
3,Not horrible... but nothing spectacular,"After hearing Stay Gold with Everything but the girl, I had to get this CD. I love that song still, but it made me wish Deep Dish had collaborated with EBTG on every track. Perhaps then the rest of the CD would have felt a little more focused and not so generically boring."
5,"A geat very ""best of"" for one of the very best","George Dalaras is one of the best singers of Greece. He recorded his first song back in 1967. Since then he has 65 personal albums and he has sold over 12 millions records! His live concerts are memorable since he is a perfectionist and he has worked with some of the best artists such as Sting, Emma Shaplin, Goran Brecovic, Al Di Meola and Paco de Lucia.Considering all the above you will realize that it is impossible to include all his best songs in one cd only. Yet this cd includes a nice variety of songs that have a depth in time and also in style. When you listen to these songs you will realize what a great talent George Dalaras has and how greatly he can perform different styles of music. I highly recommend it."
1,not quite the way it read,The Tarp arrived on time in good packaging. We opened it up and started putting it over our garden. We had built a green house type of building out of galvanized piping. We got the tarp on and found that the only reinforced eyelets are the 4 corners the rest are not. 2 of the of the other eyelets are already tearing out and we have not hardly pulled on it. It is very disappointing to pay $250 for something that will not even really last.
2,Not as described,"The item was not as described. I would have returned it but I didn't have time to wait for a replacement from another supplier. They specifically state that this tarp has gromets at an 18"" spacing. They were actually 24"" to 36"" depending on which ones you measure. I bought this particular tarp due to the gromet spacing claim, so this was a major disapointment for me.Thanks,Mick"
5,awesome - very strong,clear so light can shine through and very well made and reinforced - this is my second one and I may buy more :O)
1,Disappointed,ShelterLogic Super Max Canopy Accessories Replacement Coverwaste of money. the picture shows it comes with poles and it does not. Just a big white piece on plastic tarp. I'm sending it back
4,20 X 22 Heavy Duty Premium Silver Tarp Fit The Purpose,"Came quickly, a bit expensive but it's for an unusual size. Fits the carport exactly and is good high quality material with strong grommets that take the tight pull of those ball end bungies. Good stuff."
3,Acceptable but...,This is an acceptable tarp. I agree with most of the favorable reviews but... The sun really beats down where I live causing the roof tarp to disintegrate rapidly so I Purchased this to protect the 10 x 20 Carport Canopy we bought at Costco. I was disappointed to find when I went to install this tarp it was at least 1 foot short. They make it long enough to go over the peakside to side. But it is not long enough to cover all the way end to end. This means it wont protect the area where all the stitching is. It should be 12' x 22' If you really want to cover every bit of the roof you will need to buy two and overlap them.Hope this helps
2,sound is awful,Although I love the songs.. this cd sounded like it was recorded from an old LP album.. it has a muffled warped sound...not clear at all. The back of the cd says it contains new stereo recordings. They don't sound new to me. I would recommend The Freddy Fender Collection cd instead.
3,She needs to make up her mind!,"Kyle Spencer, an aspiring newspaper reporter, leaves New York City to work at the Raleigh (North Carolina) News & Observer.I think Spencer couldn't make up her mind what book she wanted to write, ""A New York Journalist Goes South"", ""My Dysfunctional Family"", or ""How to Find a Man"". So she tried to put all three together, and doesn't quite pull it off, resulting in an uneven quality to the book.Despite the ""Dysfunctional Family Tree"" at the start of the book, which was amusing, those parts of the book were the least interesting, and seemed almost tacked on. I would very much have liked to have had more about her experiences at the News & Observer, and the exploits of the Ten Thousand Angels Committee (four women looking for men for themselves and each other) were pretty funny.She's a good writer, but she needed someone to force her to choose among three good themes."
2,What's the point,"I was interested in reading what a Northerner had to say about Raleigh. I wasn't too offended by her representations of Raleigh, but was very offended by her needless and painful descriptions of her family and of her own behavior. I don't think I'd want to speak to her if I were one of the family members she chose to excoriate.In the end, though slightly amused occasionally, I couldn't figure out what her point was in writing this book. Also, I was very interested to read in another review of this book that she graduated from the journalism school at Chapel Hill. Not exactly culture shock to move to Raleigh."
3,Things don't always work out the way you hope...,"I knew this family when Kyle Spencer was a child, 7 to 10 years old. I used to work with her stepmother, ""Shelby"" (not her real name) and she and I also became friends. I know that ""Shelby"" had high hopes for her marriage to Kyle's father, and for her new found family, and had put a lot of energy into making it work. She and Kyle had also been very close when Kyle was a child. I finished up this book feeling very sad for my friend, because of the way things had turned out. The writing style itself will hold your attention, although I did see two writing errors which the proofreader should have caught and corrected before the book went to press."
4,Being from the South...I wasn't sure how I'd take this book!,"Actually, I think because I grew up and spent the first 18 years of my life living in Texas...I could relate to this book more. Even though Kyle and I are around the same age, we come from two very opposite lives and we're two very different people; but I was absolutely able to bond with her through the book. I will have to admit though, I couldn't relate at all to the fashion sense and brand names (mostly clothing and shoes) mentioned on almost every page. I wear Levis, sweatshirts, and shoes bought at Sears...much of the name dropping regarding clothes went over my head!Don't let any of this fool you, the book is NOT a jab at southern people or living...it is more about Kyle's need to find herself and a place to call home. Overall this book was an easy, light read and it had me literally laughing out loud, especially during the water skiing episode!"
1,Kyle is Vile,"The premise of this book is ridiculous -- since when is Raleigh, North Carolina, the ""heart of Dixie""? But even more ridiculous: the notion of a memoir in which the author ""made stuff up."" Why did she have to do that? Because the truth wasn't interesting enough? In truth, even this exaggerated memoir isn't interesting enough, in large part because Kyle Spencer is too young to be writing a memoir and because she takes herself way too seriously and thinks way too highly of herself. Her delusions of grandeur are embarrassing to read. (""I pictured myself leaping onto some carpeted auditorium stage, preparing to accept the third consecutive Pulitzer of my young career."") And her writing is just plain bad. (""I thanked Susan B. Anthony for getting the women's lib ball rolling."") Her attempts at self-depracation ring false. Get over yourself, Kyle!"
4,Life in a Pond.,"Using strong alliteration and assonance and colorful paintings, this book introduces children to the lively environment of a pond. Children are often surprised to discover that in the still waters of a pond everything from frogs, geese, dragonflys, swallows, turtles, heron, fish, bugs, and even a racoon live in and around the water. Fleming won a Caldecott Honor in 1994 for the lively illustrations in this book."
4,Fun Picture Book,"I am quickly becoming a Denise Fleming fan. Just like in Pumpkin Eye, In the Small Small Pond is more of an expression of experience and feeling rather than a play by play story.Fleming has a unique style to both her writing and her illustrations. The use of simple, rhyming prose in her books is effective and engaging. This is a fantastic book to read aloud to toddlers and small children. The illustrations are bright and stylized, creating a unique texture to the story."
5,terrific for 2 year olds,"good pictures, few words, lots of room for imagination. Our 2 year old's favorite book right now. Just a sweet book."
2,"Unit is OK, Nero is not","The unit itself is not bad, I guess. But it comes with Nero software, and I can't remember a time when Nero wasn't a peice of junk. I had hoped Nero had improved their crappy software when I bought this drive. But nope. Nero is just as crappy as always. Even when it says it has verified the written data, half of the files on DVD are marked as ready to be written. This is a major problem. And when you try to update the Nero software, good luck. Their update routine makes you jump through hoops, and if you don't follow the exact sequence, you'll be in trouble. I don't know why Nero has such a hard time making a quality product, but I also dont understand why DVD drive manufacturers cant do a better job themselves."
5,Heavy going but...,well worth the effort. No other book had as much impact on my thinking as this one. Embrace the challenge and reap the reward..
5,Essential book to women lives,"This excellent book documents the diversity of ways in which women's daily activities domestic and waged work, family caregiving and sexual activity among others affect their physical, emotional and psychological health. Every woman must read itIt makes one conscious of the amount of work is still to be done before thing change."
4,A great kids movie about growing up and letting go w/a twist,"I saw this awhile ago on TV, but I loved it. I was about 7 and it really kinda struck me because the kids were about that age too. It was about a girl getting over the death of her brother. But she doesn't tell anybody about his death. Instead she cross dresses and pretends to be him and herself. The movie is all about her adventures trying to juggling two sets of friends and the mis-haps trying to play a boy. Soon she is totally wrapped up in playing two people and is too far in to get out of her own trap. Finally, in front of a large crowd her true identity gets revieled when her dress appears from underneath her jean jacket. It sounds kinda strange but was a good movie."
5,realy inspiring film,this was an excellent film. gema zamprogna was amazing. the thing i liked the most was the way she showed her emotions of her father dieing in a odd way which shows the pain she was going through and that just made me emotional. but an excellent film it was.

1,Absolutely Sucks,It's hard to believe that Random House actually published this total waste of time. I don't believe this writer is capable of even writing a coherent obituary! Save your money!
5,The Greatest CD you'll ever own or hear!,"I went to this concert in 1983 and then bought the cassette. Unfortunately, was not able to tape it when they transmitted it on PBS. Many years later, I started searching (like crazy) for a DVD or CD, but it was as if it had never happened. At a store they looked in their specialized books of classical music and said ""apparently it was never issued in any form"". Only when I came back TRIUMPHANTLY with my cassette did they realize that I had not made it up. I'm so glad that they've finally issued the CD. I agree that this treasure should be published in DVD (I'm sure they have it in the archives of the Met). If you can get the CD, it is a must for anybody who truly loves beautiful music by two consummate performers still in great voice."
2,Numbers Numbers--where are the numbers?,"This book appears to teacher numbers but I did not find this to be the case. Throughout the entire book the phrase ""how many"" appears without a clear indication of how many there really are. I did not think this would be helpful to a child learning their numbers if they didn't know how many should be there. After analyzing the book, I realized a little movable wheel that turns with a picture matching one of the pages in the book. On this wheel a number was shown. This is the answer to ""how many"" on each page. I found this to be a confusing book and would not recommend this to the beginning number learner. This book may prove useful to one who is knows how to count well and is in need of a challenge and reinforcement."
1,Not a very good movie.,The part for the hero was very small. I didn't read the book but if the movie is like the book forget it. I didn't like the movie and I usually love all of Hallmarks. Now the scenery was beautiful but that is about it.
4,great for catherine fans,i only liked this movie because of zeta-she is great in it and young-24 yrs old
1,"A Very, Very Poor Rendition of Hardy's Story","The director and script destroy both the insightful plot and character development of Hardy's brilliant novel. Where Hardy describes Wildeve as ""one in whom women find nothing of which to object and in whom men find nothing to admire,"" Clive Owen's intensity and over-acting destroy the character and characteristic aloofness of Hardy's ambivalent and ordinary Wildeve. And compared to Hardy's complex and nuanced Eustacia, the Eustacia of the movie is revoltingly unprincipled and unsympathetic. It is difficult to imagine that Gold has any understanding of Thomas Hardy or the Late Victorians. Gold would have done better to direct a Harlequin Romance. The only things this film has in common with the novel are its title, character names, and location."
3,so-so,"There is such rich material in Hardy that it's hard to go too wrong, and this version is passable enough. Some notes:1. Everyone's complaining about the cinematography. The problem is simple: the thing was shot on a video camera, and evidently not a very good one. Presumably this series was meant for British television only. In any event, it's hard to get past this, even well into the film.2. Catherine Zeta-Jones has long had a reputation as an actress with a haughty and unpleasant personality, and I daresay you can get a whiff of that here.3. The movie is only about an hour and 45 minutes, so while it follows the novel closely, it only follows the major lines. For example, in the book, the part where Clem decides to be furze-cutter seems to go on and on, but in the movie, it's like he's in his back lawn doing some yard work for only a day.4. No subtitles! Grrrrr!"
1,waste of time,"very disappointed in this production, though it had two of my favorite actresses (joan plowright and celia imrie). the remainder of the cast was very sub-standard, it seemed very low budget and it also looked like catherine zeta-jones wears dentures. sorry, but this was very off-putting and added to my disatisfaction. it in no way captured the haunting writing of thomas hardy."
1,"Somewhere along the way...,","between making this movie 10+ years ago and getting cast as the co-lead in HBO's current series ""Rome,"" Ray Stevenson (Clym Yeobirght) learned to act. But this, as Titus Pullo would say, is cac...It's not all Stevenson's fault. Catherine Z-J, as Eustacia Vye, is dreadful as well, as is most of the dialogue. The film can't even make the Wessex landscape look pretty.For a really great adaptation of a Hardy novel, see Far from the Madding Crowd with Nathaniel Parker and Paloma Baeza. Or - better yet - just read the books."
3,Clive Owen with Catherine Zeta-Jones..,"I saw this Hallmark television movie when it originally aired. I lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch. I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to watch this film. But Hallmark is a name the presents the best, quality films. Now, there is a reason to give this film a second look. Clive Owen who plays ""Damon Wildeve"" could have become the next James Bond 007 in 2006. He was on the list of contenders, but sources say he turned down the role and so Barbara Broccoli chose the very physical Daniel Craig instead. The other reason is the female lead is Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at the time) and became an Academy Award winner for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003. Joan Plowright as ""Mrs. Yeobright"" is also in this film. I like the opening line in the film: ""Deliver my heart from this fearful, lonely place. Send me a great love from somewhere or else I shall die, truly I shall die""."
2,Ok for a cheap thrill,"I admit the only reason I got this was because it was inexpensive and I am a fan of Ray Stevenson from HBO's ""ROME"" as well as Clive Owen and my husband likes Catherine Zeta-Jones. It's the equivalent of a romance novel: light and forgettable but a guilty pleasure nonetheless."
3,The Return of the Native,I was looking for a certain Hallmark movie but couldn't remember the name of it. Ordered this one and it's not the one I was wanting. It's not a very exciting movie.
3,Works ok,I am not sure how to stretch this to 20 words. The chip seems to work and I really won't be using it until June. Maybe then I will find out its shortcomings.
3,Buy the CD's and not the cards,"I bought the Micro SD cards because I thought it would be better so that all the maps are on the card and can just plug it into my GPS. However, if you want to download specific routes or biking routes which I have done, you have to also purchase Way Point Trip Manager in order to transfer the information. If you purchase the CD you can transfer the information with Map Source which is included with the GPS. Had I known that I would have had to purchase extra software to be able to transfer the information, I would have bought the CD's."
4,"Very accurate, comprehensive map of Europe","I found very little wanting in this product. The maps are incredibly accurate, even for areas far from city centers. My only complaint is that the interface does not behave the same as it does when looking at the built-in maps of North America. Many cities, for example, do not appear until the map is zoomed-in on the region, and only then does the map for that area load and zooming out is again possible. Before I discovered this trick I was under the impression that very few metropolitan areas were covered. Only after zooming in to the neighborhood level did the right panel load, and it was possible to see the full layout of that country or region.The map also seems very recent. Some streets we did not expect to find were in fact on the map, so there is little to complain in this regard. I was also happy with the price. Definitely beats buying a dedicated unit for Europe."
3,Nuvi 660 owners beware,"As a set of maps, this product fine.But, when I plugged this card into my Garmin Nuvi 660, it seemed to run much slower, and the battery life dropped from 3-4 hours to about 15 minutes. This was a real problem, since I was trying to use it in pedestrian mode. So I just used conventional paper maps for about 95% of my trip. For my purposes, this card was a waste of $100.This problem is not an issue with the map card product per se, but you should be aware that you may not experience the usual level of GPS performance when you have a card plugged into your Garmin. This doesn't make much sense, since I suspect that the internal maps are also stored in flash memory just like the card's. But it is what I experienced. Other Garmin models might behave better than the 660."
5,Spot on,"I bought this for my wife's nuvi 260W as we were visiting the south of France. I've been here many times before, but traveling here can be a challenge, lack of (easy to find) posted street names is #1 on the list.This (micro)SD did just what it advertised, having a fantastic selection of streets in all but the tiniest of towns (it doesn't have the Route des Cretes, between Cassis and Ciotat, which has been around for 2000 or so years, maybe the cartographer was scared of narrow roads without rails) but I saw parts of Marseille that I hadn't seen before and getting around Nimes, Uzes, Nice, Monaco and St Tropez was a breeze.One caveat though, if you understand French (but speak English), choose French language on your GPS. The 'translations' to English (because they are phonetic pronunciations) are awful. You will spend a huge amount of time laughing your [...] (Try Francois, Allende, La Ciotat or pretty much any street name, they're all quite funny)Highly recommended, worth every nickle!"
4,Immensely helpful!,"We used this driving from Paris across northern France and it made the drive so much easier. Because I knew I had it, I neglected to get a proper driving map, but will get one next time. The only cons are that it took 10-15 minutes to initially figure where we were (and we had already started driving, so without a good map, we took a wrong turn or two right out of the gate - but easily back on track) and it needs to be updated, but again, easily back on track after a quick detour.) Supplement with a good map! P.S. If you're going to/from CDG and not in a hurry, program it to ""avoid tolls"" to avoid a 3ish mile stretch north of the city (on A1, I think) that cost E7.40 and had only one toll booth operator! We probably waited in line longer to pay the toll than it would have taken to avoid the expensive stretch altogether."
5,Italy Trip,"I purchased these maps for a trip to Italy. We flew into Rome, toured around Northern Italy for 2 weeks and flew back out of Venice. I wouldn't even think about doing it without the GPS. Rather than buy just the Italy map I got the full Europe for future trips."
5,Plug in and go!,"Bought this to update my USA Garmin to Europe for a 3 week driving tour of Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, France, London. The Europe card simply slid into the SD slot and automatically ran when the GPS was fired up in our first attempt in Switzerland. Found little-known hotels, gas and restaurants with ease, and guided us thru Paris (have you ever driven there? Don't!) without a hitch. I know it's an expensive card, but it worked flawlessly for driving. The pedestrian-use of the Garmin with this card is poor, and makes you walk along streets rather than easily-used short cuts...would not buy it for walking around town."
4,almost as good as Navigon,"I got this SD card when I PCS'd to Germany and although I've only used it a few times it's made every trip so much easier. I'm on my second Garmin after an unfortunate accident cracked the screen on my first. The first one was right on with everything- addresses, coordinates, speed limit changes, etc.. This one however seems to be about 300m off and it has been since I got it so I don't think it's the card. Still, that's not enough to make me get another GPS, and it's my only complaint about the system. I love everything about my Garmin and I wouldn't trade it for anything; the only thing better for getting around Europe is a Navigon(European GPS) but you also have to be able to read German to use it."
3,Time to Travel,"The map was correct, was simple to find what we were looking for, the one negative is with garmin gps, it tends to take you the longest route which sometimes isnt the best way."
5,Garmin European City Navigator microSD card,"Excellent product. Worked in all cities I visited in Scandanavia except St. Petersburg, Russia. Seller went to extraordinary lengths to ensure I received item before I departed for Europe. Much appreciated."
5,Garmin Europe Map,The Garmin Europe Map was everything it promised. We used it in Germany for two weeks and never got lost (except when we disobeyed directions).
2,Garmin City Navigator for Detailed Maps of Major Metropolitan Areas in Europe (microSD/SD Card),"I tried it once at home (in the U.S.), but it never found the satellites. I never had a chance to use it in Europe because the AC charger I ordered for the GPS unit through amazon.com did not arrive in time--before I left for Europe. I planned to use the GPS with the City Navigator microSD card for walking tours (in the Pedestrian Mode). The card was of no use to me because the charger was delivered to my home while I was already in Europe.I am trying to return it for a full refund."
1,Didnt work.,"I was just n Europe and thought this would get us around all the side streets. Unfortunately the garmin wouldn't pick up a satillite at all! So, it was useless. I would have returned it when I got home, but someone stole it all."
2,Europe Map,I own a Nuvi 200 and bought the Europe map for a trip to Portugal. The map was there and complete but I could never get my Nuvi to locate a satellite so I could use the maps. It was far easier for me to get a local tourist map than try and manually use my Nuvi. Sorry I spent the money...
1,Does not work with Nuvi 350 NA,"I bought this item based on the fact this it works with my nuvi 350 NA, as it states it support nuvi 300 series, but it does not! The device start loading maps and then stops loading without any errors, and the map is not loaded.Garmin support was useless, they had no clue why it is not working..i then checked with my brother's Garmin which is newer, and the map works fine, so I knew the card is ok.Apparently it does not work with old devices as advertised."
1,Garmin Euro Maps,"I bougth this item in spite of some marginal to bad reviews by other buyers and I regretted it. The previous reviews, saying it didn't play well with Nuvi660, were mostly correct. It took forever (ok 8 to 10 minutes) to load the maps and it wasn't very current with the roads in Spain, which were recently re-numbered. We were continually wondering whether we were on the correct road, which we usually were, but the numbers were wrong. It also miscounted several roundabout exits and had us going off on the wrong road, causing a lot of backtracking. All-in-all not a very representative product of what I expect from Garmin."
4,Garmin City Navigator for Europe,I inserted the card in my Garmin and it quickly displayed my location in Brussels. It worked just like the US version. Very accurate between cities but some issues in the extremely tangled and spaghetti like streets in most Euro cities. In any case it saved us much time and confusion. A winner.
2,Garmin Europe SD card,"I ordered the Garmin SD card for Europe which included Ireland. I was shipped a card for Brazil. You overnighted me a replacement which got to me the day before I left for Ireland. When i picked up my rental car at the airport I tried setting up the GPS but it wouldn't recognize the software. I had the employee with the rental agency try it as they rent Garmins but he couldn't get it to work. When I was in another city I saw a electronics store that sold Garmin GPS. I left it with them and after 3 hours of trying, they couldn't get it to work either.Ireland's road system is difficult and we thought that the GPS would be a huge help but ended up struggling with road maps.I would like to return the purchase to Amazon for a refund. Your service in sending a replacement was terrific but unfortunately didn't solve the problem. My unit is a GPS Nuvi 660 and this was supposed to be the correct chip.Please advise.Thanks,Ed Russell"
5,Works great - amazing little chip!,"""Plug and play"" is exactly how this product works! No registration or setup required. I used it while renting a car in Italy and it got me to every location I needed. Getting around the cities in Italy with all their crazy drivers would have been impossible without a navigation system, so I'm very glad I got the Europe edition for my Garmin!"
1,Don't waste your money. Does not work in Europe,I purchased this card for my trip to Europe only to find that it was inaccurate and did not work with the nuvi 500. total waste of money and could not get a refund because we did not come home for 2 months. You will get lost in Europe with this card.
3,Works fairly well,"Noticed a bit of static when shifting sources, and it seems that there is a bit of signal degradation as a result of the switch."
3,Review,"It was good to find this book since there aren't many books out there that cover this subject. I was disappointed, however, to find that sensory prostheses were covered so lightly. I am personally aware of much more knowledge that could have been covered with regard to visual prosthetics."
4,Practical and helpful support,"Karen Hargrave-Nykaza responded as you'd hope a mother of a child with a chronic illness would, by focusing all her energy on responding to her son's diagnosis of juvenile diabetes. She has collected her experiences into a book that helps parents in her situation get through the day without reinventing the wheel, giving examples of tip sheets, procedures, and her responses to the many crises that occur from the moment you receive a diagnosis. Karen now leads groups counseling new families with how to cope."
2,Can't Recommend,"Since using this cable, it has caused many intermittent modem disconnects. Sometimes it would occur a few times a day, but on other occasions it would occur several times a day. Maybe it was just a dud cord. The generic RJ11 cord that I'm using now has had absolutely no issues.I also don't like how difficult it is to remove from the wall plate."
4,Jeffry has thought way too hard about this DVD,"It's entertainment for those that enjoy real life calamity. No deep meaning, just entertainment."
5,Desensitize Yourself,"Banned From Television Uncensored! is for anyone who, like me, has no respect for human life. Like my title says, desensitize yourself; there is no reason to hold yourself back from the truth. You're being screwed over everyday of your life, you don't owe respect to anyone or anything, so endulge and enjoy!"
4,Good Intro for Beginners,"Pretty good book - but be warned, it is of little use if you already spend time in the backcountry (climbing, etc). This book is oriented for people unfamiliar with backcountry travel in general (winter travel issues, clothing, avalanche, etc) and not much of the book is specifically about snowboarding. If you are already familiar with that stuff, get ""The Complete Snowboarder"" instead - great book for beginner to intermediates."
1,Illustrated with MS Paint,"First, this book is not worth [the money]. The grammar was atrocious, and spelling in graphic illustrations was not checked. The book abounds with grammar errors, I'd estimate about 1 grammar error for every 3 paragraphs. It's clear the author did run a spell checker on the text, but didn't have access to a grammar checker. The pictures look like they were drawn in MS Paint. They are blocky and amateurish. With some concentration I was able to discern what the pictures were trying to convey. The black and white photographs were somewhat useful.I recommend you avoid this book, and spend your money on something else."
2,Total disappointment,"This is what happens when you make a tremendous first album; anything that follows almost always has to be a letdown, and this one is no exception. Way too much filler, funny bits that aren't really that funny--strained, more like--but then we can't expect him to create another 'No Cure For Cancer.' Buy a Bill Hicks album instead of this one, You'll get more out of it."
3,Not as good as No Cure For Cancer,Not as good as his album No Cure for Cancer but still funny. This CD is more artistic with stupid things like Deaf Mute Cocktail Party which is just two minutes of what a party would sound like with only deaf mutes there. If it didn't have stupid things like this the album would be a lot better. Denis Leary is older on this album and talks about stuff like his kids. There's a lot of stuff on here you need to have a knowledge of American politics to understand but apart from this it's a pretty good laugh.If it's a good price you should buy it.
3,Good Leary -- Bad Mix,"Good material, but the mixing was very inferior. The laughing was louder than Denis' delivery. Could hardly hear Denis in some pieces."
3,Surprise rave for Leary,"I have a fully loaded max iPod, done by my cousin so while I know a lot the plays he's put on it, when I heard Denis Leary's 'Life's Gonna Suck' kids' song, it floored me. This is one of the funniest things in tune and rhyme I've heard in a lifetime!I immediately had to have the album .... all 18 tracks worth. When it comes up on my car cd shuffle, I can't stop playing it for the ''kids' song'.Lock N Load"
2,give this man a microphone and that's it,"Sure, his songs on the end of ""No Cure"" were funny, but I could only hear about Irish drunks and his mother a couple of times before I got sick. So, when I heard that he had released ""Lock and Load"", I was excited for the comedy, and also hoping that it wouldn't be too marred by song. Well, all I can say is that it gets rather annoying to sit with my finger on the remote control so I can skip over all of the stupid music and non-stand-up bits. I only grant two stars becuase the actual comedy is pretty funny. I just hope that Dennis isn't the Ralph Ellison of comedy."
1,Denis Leary? Try Denis Leach.,"I gave this one star because there were no half stars. After I read all those reviews where people were saying Leary is the greatest standup comedian ever, how funny and confronting he is, I had to say something. Sorry, but I've got a newsflash: the guy was a blatant thief, a pale imitation of THE greatest standup to have lived, the late Bill Hicks. Bill once said of Leary: ""I stole his act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did."" Leary had the taste to rip off Bill Hicks, but Leary didn't have the grace or talent to be funny."
2,Not worth the money,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to Dennis Leary rant and rave about life. But, this was a dissapointment. Too many skits (not even funny), this was more of a let down than I had hoped. There are moments where it is funny, but I do not recommend purchasing this"
1,"Leary rips off material from others, esp. B. Hicks.","Is there some funny material on this CD? Yes (though it's not as strong as ""No Cure For Cancer""). The problem is that much (if not all) of Leary's material is stolen from other comedians. His main source was, of course, the late, great comic Bill Hicks. For proof, pick up Hicks' CDs... your respect for Denis will plummet instantly. Unfortunately, Bill died many years ago, thereby making it impossible for Leary to steal additional jokes. Perhaps this is the reason for the decline in quality on this title. If cribbing your image and act from a dead man doesn't bother you, by all means pick this CD up and enjoy... personally, I cannot support a thief."
1,Lacking in originality and generally a bore.,Bill Hicks was funny. Denis Leary isn't. Any questions?
1,Exact Bits Leary Stole from Hicks,"Leary is a hack. He wasn't ""influenced"" by Bill Hicks, he STOLE material. That makes him a hack. How can you Leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack? Take it up with Webster's Dictionary.The exact bits Leary stole are described in the book AMERICAN SCREAM on pages 201-202. Bill Hicks was incensed when he heard Leary's tape.On behalf of Bill's memory, give credit to the original."
4,Air Guitar Nation - Amazon Online Instant Video,"I thought this ""rockumentary"" was great. It was a great look at a unique culture, and had a feel good ending."
1,No closed captioning,"No closed-captioning equals a ZERO vote.Without CC, this DVD is USELESS to hearing-impaired people.Not considering disabled viewers is just typical of Docurama."
5,Fried fresh fish for dinner?,"This review first appeared in the ""Ephrata (PA) Review.""Piggy is excited; he's going fishing with Dad for the first time. They prepare sandwiches, hunt for worms, sit and wait (or squirm impatiently), even catnap!Dad soon sees this will not be just another fishing trip, because, well, little boys have fresh ways of looking at things. Will they end their day with the delicious fried fresh fish Dad is dreaming of?Perhaps not, but lucky are those with dads like Piggy's, who take their cues from their young ones, and go with the flow. They and their children invent their own ways of doing things together.The gentle watercolor and pencil illustrations are good-natured depictions of father and son. Daddy Pig looks relaxed in Hawaiian shirt, floppy hat and glasses. Piggy never removes his bright yellow boots. The illustrator has winsomely captured young boys' body movements and facial expressions."
4,Grandiose 1980's romance,"If a long, eventful, saga-like romance is what you're looking for, this book is for you. I greatly enjoyed following the heroine through her harrowing and sensual adventures, and the hero through his seemingly hopeless love for her. The suspense of the book lay not in if they would make it work, but if they would ever see each other again. The author did a good job of making this interim interesting to read. The Eastern European setting was also unexpected and fresh."
4,Hot and funny,Sexy and hot story.... Liked the characters.... The sex is very steamy... A good short read looking forward for more!
1,Unrealistic,"This book is just erotica and has NO romance in it. It should""ve been decribed as fantasy. You cannot just kidnap someone like that. Its not sexy, its not cute. The lead character was also VERy causal about having a threesome with his married brother. Also, if he wanted someone to love him for his money and live in the shack with him, how would she have made a living. Also, where did the love come from? As I said, should've been sold as Erotic Fantasy as there is nothing reaL About this book. If you are looking for something steamy (that incluides anal) this is the book for you. If youre not.....skip it even if its free."
2,Started but did not finish,"I started reading this book, but did not finish it, and requested a refund from Amazon. I'm sure the author did a great job writing the book, and the book reviews were great BUT ***spoiler alert*. I stopped reading this book when I realized that Jacque was going to have a menage with his brother and Sahara. EEWWW! If you're in to that, I'm sure you will love the book, but it was too much even for me."
2,Weak writing with some steamy sex,"Cannot recommend. The hot steamy sex does not make up for the weak writing and the stupid plot. Too many times I found myself rolling my eyes and saying, ""Oh, you've got to be kidding!"""
3,good read,Fast pace and entertaining. well written. enjoyed the storyline the sexual tension keeps you turning pages and the characters are engaging
5,Spicy and Saucy,Great book! If you like Spicy and Saucy this is the book for you! I was entertained and pleasantly surprised!
3,A Pretty Hot Novel. Not Much Story.,"I though this was a pretty hot book, but lacked much of a story. All in all, not bad if you are looking for a steamy read."
2,ok quici read,"This a a very quick read and very perdictable, funny at times and it contained a great deal of sex OK book"
5,Cajun Hot,this is really a hot story about how someone could imagine how the Bayou could be. i just love how this Cajun man saw himself.
4,Sexy & steamy,"If you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy this as erotica, then it's a fast fun read. There is some ""kinky"" sexual play involved, but the hinted threesome is only in one scene and this is primarily a lusty love story. The flavor of the bayou country is also definitely imparted."
4,Cajun Hot,"I Loved it, it was beautifully sexual, and i loved the cajun characters. The story was well written and a good length"
1,Don't waste your time,The only good think about this book is that it was a free book on Kindle.The plot was ridiculous and the writing was sooooo bad and I'm just sorry I wasted time on reading this.
5,Hot? Mais Oui!,"This is one of the first erotic romances I ever purchased. Back then I had to order the DTB from the author. She even signed it. I was not disappointed. Hot swamps, hot hero, hot sauce and hot sex. What more could we want? Nikita Black/Nina Bruhns is a favorite. I am glad to have it available on my Kindle. I'd love to read a lot more by this author."
5,Keeping History Alive,"As a child, I always enjoyed going on vacation to the East Coast and passing through so many small towns in our oldest states. You can see courthouses, factories, churches, schools, and other buildings that, despite the business or indifference of those who pass through them, have a story to tell.Lola Miller has captured those stories.The Old Central City portion of Huntington, WV was in danger of being lost until this work appeared and ensured the preservation of this national treasure. It chronicles the city with a personal perspective through hundreds of photographs with insightful commentary. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to spend an afternoon escaping to an old Virginia town."
3,Basie Swings AUDIO DVD,"This AUDIO DVD is in a format that is new to me, here in the UK.I thought I had bought a ""normal"" DVD with both AUDIO and FILM of Count Basie performing, so I was dissapointed to find that this DVD has AUDIO only.Nevertheless, there are some great tracks on this disc and the quality of the sound is superb.I will be more careful when ordering DVD's from now on."
5,"Basie in 5.1 surround, AWESOME!",This audio DVD sounds great! A must have for any Basie fan. The Cheif would have been proud if he heard this.
3,over priced,For a simple DVD it was over priced. I spent the money for a particular reason but the product is not worth the price.
5,Never met a singular proposition I didn't like.,"I would merely say the book is intriguing and beautifully clear, particularly in two respects: (1) Kripke's own seeming ambivalence about propositional attitudes in ""Puzzle about Belief"" can be interestingly taken in one direction rather than another. Anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of Bruce Wayne's claim that ""I am Batman"" (and felt informed, unlike Alfred the butler) will pay serious attention to Soames' distinctions between assertion and linguistic meaning. (2) The treatment of theoretical identities as necessary if true without reference to rigid designation is quite important. Thus, this book represents a major event."
4,"wise man not wise, family is no business","Unlike the NYC fella in the Godfather, wise man in this one aren't so wise, their fingers are not on the strings.The movie proved one thing-unlike Godfather, one cannot ran a business like a family, or ran a family like a business.Sam got in blind love with a whore, just unbelievable for a smart ""ace"" gambler."
3,Odds are you'll like it,"Good enough to own, but not one of my favorite mob movies. I find the narration a little annoying, kind of like a book on tape, but it's a good story."
5,Even BETTER than GoodFellas!!!!!,"Of many of Robert De Niro's films, Casino is a classic! I consider Casino better than GoodFellas! This film has a lot more action than GoodFellas and makes it even more interesting to watch. All in all, if you buy GoodFellas, you got to have Casino to go along!My points:GoodFellas- 95/100 Casino- 100/100"
3,A tale of two tapes.....,"When I rented it it came on two VHS tapes. The first half of the movie was great as the story and characters develop. Then the second half denigrates into a bloodbath of butcher scenes. Totally uncalled for and after over three hours it was tiresome as well. Not nearly as good as ""Goodfellas"" which was shorter, moved smoothly and much less graphically violent and bloody."
1,Brutal,More than what was expected as far as the seamier side of life and this shows those times. A mistake for me.
3,"AMAZED, BUT DISGUSTED","I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS A GREAT MOVIE OVERALL, BECAUSE OF THE CAST AND THE ACTING. I LOVED THE WHOLE MOB SETTING AND HOW IF YOU TALK BEHIND OTHER PEOPLES BACK YOU'LL BE IN HOT WATER. SHARON STONE WAS GREAT WITH HER DEEP CHARACTER AS A HUSTLER. PESCI WAS GREAT AND SO WAS DENIRO.BUT THE VIOLENCE WAS GROSS AND MADE ME ALMOST PUKE. SCCORSCE WAS VERY--TOO REALISTIC. EYES POPPING OUT, BULLETS THROUGH THE HEAD, AND PEOPLE BEING CRUSHED FROM A VICE MACHINE? THEN OF COURSE PESCI AND DE NIRO BEING BRUTALLY BEATEN WITH BATS 100'S OF TIMES THEN BURIED IN A HOLE ALIVE! WHAT NEXT? A CHAINSAW?"
4,very enjoyable,"this, along with goodfellas, is scorsese's answer to copolla's godfather. like goodfellas casino takes the opposite tack of godfather, eschewing myth and bigger-than-life storytelling and characters to give us instead the real dirt on the gangsters and the casinos they looted, er, i mean operated. casino isn't quite as tight as goodfellas - after a fast start the story meanders a little in the middle. but it does have some fine acting by the 3 principles, especially stone. de niro plays a staid, 2-dimensional character but gives his usual fine performance. pesci reprises his goodfellas character and he's even more reckless and nasty, if that's possible. and you have to see what happens to him at the end!an enjoyable film, not quite as tight as its close cousin, goodfellas, but very much worth seeing."
1,Disc Will Not Play,"First Disc would not play at all. Amazon sent replacement.Second Disc Freezes up at Chapter 10. I am now S.O.L. according to Amazon.....I am sorry that your replacement shipment was also problematic.As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however,I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."
3,Love the (((((RAGE)))) in this movie,"Being Italian myself there was something familiar about the rage between Sharon Stone's character (Ginger) and Robert Deniro's, they loved each other deeply yet hated each other in the same depths. Excellent acting. Made me remember, we only hate the ones we love anyway, without love there can be no hate. Think about it, people we don't care about, there are no feelings there, where as with those we LOVE, it can swing to both ends of the spectrum.I think the F bomb was however dropped way too much in this movie, I mean honestly, it was overdone. Good acting, good acters, a good 3 star 1995 movie."
1,takes 6-7 minutes before it plays,"This is second Casino DVD. Exchanged 1st one with no problem through Amazon, sent me a new one very fast, unfortunately same problem. Universal Logo, pick language screen,FBI Anti Piracy screen, Opinions and View screen,this film rated R screen, Then 5 full minutes before you come to the DVD menu to pick play, chapters, etc. Have updated firmware new player Panasonic BD45. Feel this DVD was incorrectly cut/manufactured. Ridiculous!"
1,Highly disappointed...,"Just picked this one up only to realize Universal has appearently dropped the second side of extras yet still has the audacity to label it ""Special Edition"". The only extras you now get are the ""Moments"" commentary, ""The Story"" featurette and deleted scenes, all of which are in fact listed on the back, yet there still is the tag ""Plus More!"" Ripoff."
2,Too Much Gore and Foul Language,"Martin Scorsese directs this movie about Las Vegas set in the 1970's and 80's. The mob is in control and then goes out of control. The whole story makes you want to take a shower and find a safe place.""Casino"" is a story of Las Vegas glamorous past and fairy tale exterior. The mob runs rampant beneath the glitz and glitter as we see the stark contrast of blood money and the beautiful people who own beautiful things. ""Casino"" shows the rise of a casino owner with mob connections (Robert De Niro), his friend and Mafia underboss (Joe Pesci) and in ex-prostitute with a strong will and expensive taste (Sharon Stone).Based on a true story, overall it is just too much of everything, blood, gore, gangsters and drugs."
4,"Excellent, not quite a five, though.","Wouldn't expect much less from the bodies that were brought together for the film. It is by far one of the most quotable movies ever (""You can either have the money and the hammer or...""). The extremely small gripe I have is the widescreen stuff. The disc would have been amazing had it have been dual-sided, dual-layered with a full-screen version other treats. This is all aside from the movie, however. One of the best soundtracks I can think of, leaves you thinking you know everything you need to know to sound smart about the mafia; or at least provides insight on how to string together the most amazing swears you can comprehend (talk about quotable, you degenerate)."
5,Godfather's little brother,"Yes, Godfather is THE movie to beat and Casino doesn't do it. But like Goodfellows, Casino is the best of the best BELOW the caliber of Godfather. Assuming no movie, especially no mafia movie, can come close to Godfather I or II, then we have to make the bar lower than GF for the ""best"" movies. (Do you get what I'm saying? It is a little convoluted.) And for the ""new bar"" then Casino is the best (along with GoodFellows) and I highly suggest that you get this movie and keep it in your home library. You'll watch it again and again."
4,great movie,Love this movie. Love all the actors especially Robert Di naro Joe Pesci. Held my interest all through the movie which I like.
4,Classic Mobster movie but a different Feel.,"Robert DeNiro plays an intelligent casino owner in Las Vegas. His leadership style and high standards leads to a very successful operation. The muscle behind his casino, played by Joe Pesci, takes care of any problems facing the casino using classic mob means- but the man eventually gets out of control which leads to a series of trouble throughout the movie.Their lives, which start at the high life, gradually decline and the results become trajic- like most mafia movies.Everything about the movie is great, but it does become very long and drawn out once you realize that disaster is immenent."
4,Never Saw it But heard ITS GREAT,"MY FRIEND AND MY FAMILY SAID ITS JUST LIKE GOODFELLAS. PESCI PLAYS BASICALLY THE SAME ROLL. AND OF COURSE DENIRO IS ALWAYS AWESOME! WEL I JUST RENTED IT FROM BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO, SO LET ME GO WATCH IT. PEACE OUT!"
3,great filmmaking but the violence is too much for this viewer,"this has always been my struggle with scorcese. he is clearly one of the most talented filmmakers alive today. Taxi, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, his foray into edith wharton -- all classic movies. but despite the usual brilliance -- the great acting of de niro, pesce, stone & woods, the screenplay, the cinematography -- the brutality of this movie tipped it to the negative for me.i am not saying it's less than brilliant filmmaking. i'm just saying for this viewer it is too much too watch."
3,Very entertaining but just too much violence and blood,"The storyline to Casino is well written and very entertaining, but thought the graphic violence, blood and language was just too much. Especially the ending scene with Pesci, I mean there are other similar movies like this I have enjoyed but for some reason thought it went too far here. This is by no means a family movie or one for kids. If you like mystery/crime movies then think you will enjoy it and even though it's a very long film, should keep your attention well from beginning to end but if you don't like a lot graphic violent blood scenes like ones from horror films, then you might want to skip it.Peter J. Miller"
2,James Fontanetta,"This movie was a disappointed. I think it was overrated. I expected a lot more. If you want to see great films in the same genre, try Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, The Godfather"
2,No apologies,"This didn't do it for me. After reading the intriguing Vanity Fair article I was floored by the seedy story & characters. Unfortunately for the flick, the constantly-ridiculous soundtrack and annoying narration ruins each scene's ambiance. I like Don Rickles, but what's the hockey puck doing walking around with a shotgun? Totally miscast. I've really given up on Scorsese. He's gotten predictable and borderline boring. That last line also applies to Bringing Out The Dead. 2 stars. One for James Woods. The other for James Woods."
1,casino,"This product was sold to me with a defect, ordered another one and was sent out a used copy, also with a defect !"
5,Casino,"This movie is absolutely riveting from start to finish. Joe Pesci is the ultimate out-of-control 'Wiseguy', De Niro the sociopathic casino manager and the awesome Sharon Stone plays my ex-wife to perfection. Very entertaining movie, a must see."
4,intense story,"compelling and tragic story with brilliant script and sharp visuals. was great on blu ray. great acting from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesch."
2,Frozen Out,"This is a great movie, a second purchase for me as I have the original DVD that came out a while back. I bought the tenth anniversary edition, expecting even greater picture quality along with numerous additional features. Universal didn't disappoint in that area; however, my disc freezes (and skips) so frequently, that I'm unable to watch the movie. I've contacted Universal and have been told to return the defective disc to them, along with a detailed explanation of my problem. I imagine that the company will send me a replacement, since they did replace two defective discs from my Abbott and Costello collection (took about six weeks to get them). As much as I like their movies, I really find it frustrating as a consumer to have to deal with this problem. Seems to me that Universal could take steps to alleviate this situation."
3,Buy GoodFellas instead,"Good (because of Scorsese and Deniro) but eventually grating film (because of Stone) about the mob in Vegas. The docu-first hour is great, but leaves the characters flat and under developed, squandering the Jerry Springer-ish third act.Still ,it's better than most films out there."
4,flawed but great,"The only problem I have with this movie is the performances of DeNiro and Pesci. They are just too similar to their work in Goodfellas. It seems almost like some kind of encore. Other than that, excellent movie in the vein of Goodfellas and Mean Streets. Not as good as those two msterpieces but on the same level. Highly recommended.Ivan Rorick"
5,Really wanna enjoy your HDTV blu ray purchase?,"The film itself gets 5 stars IMO, but the way it was filmed, combined with the bright lights of Las Vegas, makes this one of the most beautiful cinematic experiences i have ever had. Really sold me on the difference between standard def vs HD."
5,Good performance by Don Rickles,"Rickles steals the movie as the DeNiro's sidekick, great scene in the movie where he tries to throw Joe Pesci out of the casino and Pesci goes ballistic and slams Rickles upside the head with a telephone."
3,"Casino - a great movie, but a unworthy edition","Well, I just cannot believe my eyes:No Booklet, only one disc wich is looking like a bootleg!!Furthermore you have to turn it to see the special features!The Mastering is fine as is the movie,in fact great.How come this masterpiece deserves such ugly horryfying looks???Shame on the resposibles!print this amazon, I dare You!!!!"
2,Defective Discs,"Amazon was nice enough to replace this movie after it wouldn't budge at the 96 minute mark. Unfortunately, the replacement disk was also defective, freezing multiple times. I thought it was just me, but read that another reviewer had the same problem."
1,AN OUTSTANDING MOVIE EXCEPT AUDIO COMMENTARY BY......,I like to enjoy movie digesting contents what it really tells and expresses about while watching. DeNiro and Stone's acting performances are already excellent enough to let me know what this movie says about besides based on true story. But... terribly disgusted that the director used story telling style by adding the audio commentary made by the actors during acting in a result of reducing the original characters of the movie eventually !!!
1,Blu-Ray Review,I have this on HD DVD and I just bought it on Blu-Ray and out of the 150 plus Blu-Rays that I own this is the only one that takes a long time to load. Anyone else have any problems with this disc loading?
1,Puke!,"The worst thing ever to be shown at the cinema. I puked in my pants and had to go naked home. I almost froze to death, cause I had to walk 20 miles. Don't watch this film - if not for your own sake, do it for me!"
1,HORRIBLE!,This is one of the worst movies of all time. So bad that I have had to repress the plot in order to function as a responsible member of society. It reminded me of a cheesy made for television movie. An incredibly LONG cheesy made for television movie.Like a 70s miniseries or a Danielle Steele novel.
2,falls flat,"the more you watch this one the worse off, you get,ITS like CARTOONoversimplyfied MANNERISMS grow WISH full filling EMTY FACADE, WHATS IT ABOUT ANYWAYS, director going for it ALL THE BIG EPIC GRANDEUR WITHOUT A STORY OR SCREENPLAY TO HOLD all these CLICHES up; it becomes like a parody of ITSELF,MOST HOLLYWOOD,SLUMMING OVERRATED,icon muck,done ever and ever simply morality plays hit me over the head again and again HAMMER,violence allways on edge,SMOKING DINEROS,ALWAYS PISSOFFED, stone is always beautiful and haggard, and that little short fat guy is always mean and a psycho.WHATS THE POINT WHERES THE ENJOYMENT IN being a voyeour to all these screenBLINd ALLEYS ,CHEAP AND EMPTY ,no hummor,MIRRORS TO STUPENDOUS echo future,WHERES THE PAYoff?"
4,"Another excellent ""mob"" movie from Scorsese","""Casino"" is a ""mob"" movie set in 1970s and 80s Las Vegas.It's from the same team behind ""Goodfellas"" - Martin Scorsese (director and co-writer) and Nicholas Pileggi (co-writer and writer of the original book) and even includes the incomparable Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in the lead roles. It is very similar in style and tone to this earlier film.This similarity detracts from its impact somewhat but ""Casino"" is still a very good film. It contains many memorable moments, good music, and is stylishly directed by Scorsese."
5,Very SATISFIED Customer,"I LOVE this movie. Robert DeNiro is BRILLIANT as always and Sharon Stone was so good in her role as a drug and alcohol addicted slut, that I enjoyed hating her. I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't already seen it. I would also recommend this seller annamack2008, the movie was in the condition the seller advertised and I got it in 2 days(the quickest I've ever gotten anything thru amazon.com).Thanks again."
2,Bad DVD for a great movie,"If you already own the tape, don't bother buying the DVD. The quality is sub par and with all that surrounded this movie you would think that there wouild have been some extras. There is nothing. Hopefully someone will come out with a SE version."
2,"""GoodFellas in Vegas""","The first hour of ""Casino"" (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best - a mini-masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace. Unfortunately, once you get past the dazzling semi-documentary introduction, the remaining two hours become a tired self-parody of the director's earlier crime films. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone cannot redeem a disappointingly melodramatic script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. In the end, the ambitious yet overlong ""Casino"" fails to pay off."
3,Wouldn't work on certain Blu-ray players,"I purchased this item (Casino) along with another (Goodfellas). Goodfellas worked fine on my Samsung player, and Casino couldn't get past the 'Play movie'!...The customer service at Amazon is Superior! I had another 'Casino' blu ray video the next day!...It, too, did not work!...So I figured it might be my Samsung player...So, rather than purchase another blu-ray player, I purchased a Playstation 3 which has Blu-ray capabilities...Guess what...the Casino dvd worked with the Playstation 3...The bottom line...the Casino dvd will not work on some Blu-ray players!"
4,Finally gets the deluxe edition it richly deserves,"Definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films, Casino FINALLY gets it's due. Filmed in Super 35, it's never looked better than here. It's been a long wait from the days of laserdisc and even the original dvd release, but it's been worth it. A film like this has dialogue so crisp you want to read along, but unfortunately it is NOT closed-captioned, only subtitled and SPARSELY at that, not detailed; a minor complaint, but if you want to savor every word spoken, it's a little disappointing. Would love to have had a full-length commentary featuring De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese sitting down to talk through this but the track that is included is still very good. Excellent disc; would have been worth picking up again for the improved film transfer."
5,Keep Your Pens Away From Joe Pesci,"This is an entertaining Scorsese mafia take. With a brutally entertaining story and top notch acting, this film is stabbingly great. This movie easily fits in with the Big ones- the Godfather's and Goodfellas. This is a must own for fans of the organized crime genre."
4,great video and sound,"While I usually like to review the quality of the DVD itself, this is a very good film besides. I love De Niro and Pesci, but the star of this show was probably Sharon Stone. Although I'm not a huge fan of Stone's, she did a remarkable job. De Niro as a Jew was a bit far-reaching, but believable. Pesci, as usual, was Pesci. 'Nuf said. The DVD quality is great - beautiful picture and great sound. Besides the obligatory trailer, actor bios, and production notes, there are no noteworthy extras. That's a shame, but doesn't take away from this Scorsese masterwork! The best part of this is seeing the maybe-true aspect of corruption in gambling casinos."
3,Martin Scorsese down fall begins here.,"This is where it all happen for the great Martin Scorsese. His take on the origin of Las Vegas is not only a step back for the director but a bad reflection on Robert Deniro himself. He is good in this movie but he is saddle with a over acting Sharon Stone ( which is good but she goes a bit too far), and a tepid Joe Pesci. The movie is a bit too long for its own good, and needed to shave the minuts down.I don't know what went wrong with this great director because the next films after are almost as bad as this film turn out to be."
4,Casin in HD-DVD,Excellent upgrade from the SD-DVD. Recommended buy! Too bad HD is going to die.. Great movie to the book and American Justice-Vegas and the Mob which aired on A&E.
4,What a picture !,"I mean that statement in two ways. First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own. I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !"
5,The MAFIA fumbles the ball in Las Vegas!!,"Martin Scorsese was the man that owned That MAFIA Genre in the 90's,With ""GOODFELLAS"" and ""CASINO"".This Movie shows how the MAFIA fumbled the ball in Las Vegas & lostall ties to the city in the Desert.They go from making millions to making the biggest mistake of theirlife!!If you like MAFIA movies check this one out, I give it 5 of 5 stars!!"
5,Martin Scorsese does it again.,"First of all, Goodfellas is still Scorsese's finest work, but Casino is a very close second. Reuniting with Robert Deniro Joe Pesci and Nicholas Pieggi, Scorsese scores again. Casino is the story of how the mob lost control of its gambling empire in Las Vegas, due to over-indulgence, lust, and eventual betrayal. Robert Deniro plays Sam(Ace)Rothstein, the mobs front man for their Vegas operation. Joe Pesci reprises his role as a hot headed, itchy triger finger gangster, and Sharon Stone wonderfully plays Robert Deniro's wife, the vixen who accidentaly brings the empire down(why didn't she get an Oscar!) Her performance soars! Some people may find the language, and brutal violence offensive, but Casino has earned every star it has gotten, and then some."
5,Good story......,"What could I say? 'Joe Pesci,Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone'I think the names say it all: 'A perfect film with a powerful story'"
4,One of the best Mafia movies of all time,"If you like Mafia movies, you'll love Casino. If you don't like Mafia movies, this is still worth seeing just for the stellar acting job of the entire cast."
4,Rober DeNiro's Casino,"If you love Mob style gangster films set around the gambling culture of the LA Strip, then this is a must see for you.Direceted by Martin Scorcese's the rocky relationship between Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone, keep you on the edge of the seat coupled by his brother's furious temper as played by none other than Joe Pesck, the story is upbeat, sad and violent all at the same time. Although a long film, at over 3 hours, it is one you will certainly watch time and time again.Note: There is a lot of violence in the film and children should certainly not watch this film."
2,It's okay Scorsese; I forgive you.,"It's not Goodfellas. It never had the potential to be Goodfellas. I've read the book and it was long arduous reading, just liek this film is long arduous viewing. Almost identicle team-up from Goodfellas simply makes you wonder if perhaps he was just looking for more praise and/or money. Cut it two hours and it might be tolerable. Note: I don't hate long movies just beacuse there long, I hate them if there long without content. I loved Magnolia and Gone With The Wind so don't even attempt to criticize."
2,just another scorsese flick,"dont get me wrong this movie was cool, but it took a long time to actually get started"
2,Crippled American Version,This is a great movie that deserves a better dvd treatment. The layout and features are extremely vanilla. Not since Dracula have I see such a vhs content type dvd. Maybe in the future it will get a proper treatment in a boxset but in its current condition this release shouldn't be purchased to accompany any collection.Also its important to note that this is not the uncut version. So far the only uncut version of this classic to make it to dvd is the Australian release.
3,Yet another gawddamn double dip.,"Why do the studio's keep churning out movies without any real difference?I mean Casino was known at the time of release to have been cut down to get an R rating. But here in the rerelease we get yet the same version of the flick as before with a better picture and not the different soundtrack. Sounds alot like Scarface to me.The audio com's as cool as they are, are not that worthy of repeat listening.SO what else does this ""new"" double DVD have? Alternate Ending? No. Double disc? No. Uncut version of the film? No. Retarded extras that you would only view once with nothing added to the film? Yup.Waste your money if you want, I smell a 20 year Special Edition waiting in the wings.Thanks.Oh and if this review seems like a copy of the one I did for GoodFellas...it's because it is...only slightly different.B."
2,"Why Scorcese, WHY?","The film itself is great; everyone will agree on that.What bothers me here is the fact the film appears on an abhorable double-sided disc without a commentary.First fans had to suffer through the indignity of the DVDs initial release with a lackluster transfer, zero extras, flimsy case and a price that never dropped in the nine years the film was available on DVD. Now, if the studio wants to bother with a anniversary edition please 1.) pack it to the gills with -real- extras like commentaries, documentaries and maybe some sort of retrospective... not just a couple deleted scenes and a few other forgettable thorw-away scraps on an f'n flipper.But then again, who am I kidding, I'll still buy it."
2,"Continuity problems hurt ""'Fellas"" follow-up","I am a big fan of ""Goodfellas"", although I usually watch my tv-edited version, with toned-down violence and language. Who needs that stuff? Because of this, I was eager to see the movie's sequel, ""Casino""; I was full of curiosity to see what had happened to the mobsters since the last movie.My suspicions were immediately raised when I began watching the opening credits: no Ray Liotta. He was such a big part of the last movie, I was surprised he was neither included nor mentioned in this one. I was also surprised to see Joe Pesci included, since it didn't seem like he'd be around for the sequel, if you know what I mean.On the whole, while it feels good to be back with these characters again, the whole thing seems like a cash-in. I think I'll just stick with Goodfellas, and leave Casino to the real fans."
5,classic restored,"The first time you see Ace Rothstein's salmon pink suit you will know you made the right choice in buying this blu-ray if you already have the dvd. No need to go into the story since you should know it by now.The blu-ray really makes this movie look good, especially since there are so many bright and colorful scenes. Audio is good and Scorcese's soundtrack delivers plenty of funk and glamour."
5,goodfellas 2,"sure it reminds people of goodfellas but this movie is based on a true story. i find it fascinating. maybe a little long but good. robert deniro is good in anything. he is awesome. the movie is about the mob's rise ad fall in las vegas. they pretty much started sin city but got greedy. i dont want to say too much about the ovie. it is a great movie and if you liked goodfellas, you will like this one also."
3,Sicc-A-Cell,"If you don't have this CD while your hittin corners than you must ""C"" a softy! And your out of order, short, and stubby like your weennie!"
4,The is a good cd,"This cd is good I'm not going to say it is the best cause it is not. The song ""you created me"" is the s$#@. The hook on it is hard as hell thanks to C bo. All the other songs have good lyrics but the only one that I love is that song. It's worth the money for sure."
3,FOR NEWBIES ONLY,"This books covers the client-side topics every developer should know, but hardly goes into enough detail on any one topic to be useful.I really wish the topics were covered in more depth. New developers might find this to be a good introduction to the topics. However, you won't be able to do much unless you have access to more detailed information from other sources."
4,Christianity compared,"It seems to me that the whole point of this book is to suggest that all of the familiar aspects of Christian doctrine, such as the immaculate conception, were somehow borrowed from other religions, and that nothing in Christianity is unique or original, thus implying that Christianity is false. But even if one does not agree with this, one can still enjoy this book as finely written."
1,B.S. NOT A GOOD BOOK,the only person who would obtain power from this book would be a wieght lifter.this book is not good enough to borrow
1,Not the right hook...,"I ordered this hook quite some time ago... and got the wrong one. Even though it's advertised as a ""powerknead"" hook and the picture is of the spiral hook, the part number, and in fact the hook you will receive, is the standard C-shaped hook. The difference in part number is KN256BDH (C-shaped hook - the part number in the description here) vs KNS256BDH (spiral hook - the part displayed in the picture, but not the part number in the description) - THE ""S"" IS ESSENTIAL or you will get the wrong one. DON'T order this one assuming you will get the spiral hook. I tried to get them to exchange it numerous times - the return shipping label was always ""on it's way"" - finally I gave up and I'm stuck with a hook I don't want and already have one of (my machine came with a C hook, but I find the spiral hook works much better) - I'll just have to try get rid of it elsewhere I suppose..."
1,"Show me a accoustic guitar! Title says ""On Acoustic Guitar""",Very misleading description. Nowhere on the DVD is the instructor playing an acoustic. The only disclaimer is some text at the introduction that an electric guitar will be used for instruction purposes and that the two types of guitars are similar. I disagree.
2,not the best,"this is not for scratch beginners! very confusing to say the least! he starts by showing ""power chords"" that mean nothing to a beginner! its not a split screen, so you cant tell where he is fingering the fret board. it may be a good lesson disk if you allready know the basics of playing and know the 7 basic major chords. i don't recamend this for a beginner!!"
2,harder to understand than I hoped,This video was harder to understand than I was hoping never played before. I wouldn't recommend to a true beginner as myself
2,Really hard to follow,I bought this after reading several reviews that this would be easy to follow and to learn to play from. It made me really frustrated. I am a fast learner but this went way too fast. This is probably good for someone who already knows the basics but NOT for a beginner who does not know the basics. I am really disappointed.
3,Hmmm,"I have to agree with TDub... I found it odd that this dvd is titled ""Getting Started with Acoustic Guitar"" When he's using an electric guitar. Albeit I found it useful it didnt give me quite the feel I was looking for because the sound of an electric is different. They should tell you somewhere about this on the cover..."
3,Guitar DVD,I Don't even have a guitar yet and just bought the DVD to see it I could maybe learn it. The video goes pretty fast but is good. I think I will have to have personal instruction instead.Good Luck
1,awful!,DO NOT BUY! it's a really bad video. i'm just starting with guitar and this video was recommended. i purchased it and was extremely disappointed. he doesn't show you exactly where to put your fingers on the frets and strings making it impossible to learn guitar.
1,Technical issues and content issues,The dvd navigation was not consistent with the written materials and did not present a complete menu. Items were referenced that could not be found on the menu. Perhaps an Amazon issue in handling my return as my request for a replacement was not fulfilled.
2,Too Easy??,"I bought this product based on previous reviews that were posted. I would NOT recommend this DVD for the average beginner. This may be a useful product if you have never, ever, picked up a guitar (or possibly even seen a guitar) and want to start playing."
5,Fender Presents: Getting Started on Acoustic Guitar -- A Guide for Beginners,Got the product fast and it was in the best shape! No problems and this is a great person to buy product from.
3,Fender Acoustic Guitar,"This DVD is okay, you see and hear different chords being used to learn in the lessons. It was not what I expected though."
1,NEVER ARRIVED,THIS ITEM NEVER ARRIVED AND AMAZON WON'T DO A THING ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF 'SUPER SAVER' SHIPPING. BOO AMAZON
1,Disappointing,"Most of stuff on the DVD is old and can be found on youtube. there are no drills to practice, and the music is too old and boring. not worth the money."
4,A Complete Beginner's Review,"So, you've just bought your first guitar and now need to figure what books or lessons you'll take? And there's 100 of choices...And you think all the free stuff on YouTube might be enough...I bought this DVD and a book recommended by the local music store where I had my guitar set-up. Hands down, this DVD is way better than any book and better than any of the ""free"" lessons you can find on YouTube.The lessons start with simple things like how to hold the guitar and tune it. From there, you'll learn some simple chords and strumming techniques. There's looped backing tracks you can play along with, so from the very first lesson you're actually ""playing"" guitar. It's a real feeling of accomplishment.A drawback is that the DVD doesn't come with any chord charts - it would have been nice to have a printed set of beginners chords to refer to as you play along (this is where the book I bought does have value).Definitely recommended for the beginner."
1,Not for an absolute beginner and terrible quality,"This DVD is not for someone without any guitar experience.At first it seemed to be for the beginner, but within a couple of the first steps of the video, it quickly goes directly into ""chords"" without any explanation of what a ""chord"" is and seems to skip a bunch of basic (beginner) information.Additionally, the video began to ""jump"" and shake and so it is hard to watch - this could just be a bad copy that we received, but we know it's not our player because we played a regular (movie) dvd without issue.I don't know, this might be a good guide for someone with some previous guitar background/experience, but not for the novice/beginner who's never played before."
3,It's ok,It was ok and would recommend. Not really what I was expecting not really sure what I was expecting. But feel others may like
3,Learning Guitar,"This provides basic information, which for the beginner is good. I guess I was expecting more in the way of songs/music to practic, but learning the notes, terms and practicing moving the fingers is worth it."
3,"Good tips, but why are the lessons not taught with an acoustic guitar?","I liked the verbal sincerety and clarity of the instructor. His teaching style and playing command are inspiring, and for this I would give him 5 stars. I did get good tips from him that I now have to just practice as much as possible. The fact that the instructor taught his lessons with a Fender electric guitar throughout the DVD was a big turn off for me and unfortunately weighs quite a bit on my overall rating. I wish the DVD cover would not mislead customers, and I wisk that other reviewers had commented on this, as it would have changed my decision to purchase this DVD."
4,Excellent Product,"This is a great product for a beginner guitarist. I've been playing for about 4 years (not very well, I might add) all self taught until now. This DVD is extremely easy to follow, navigate and learn from. It's fixed some of my bad habits. The practice tracks are virtually the same for a lot of the things you learn, which is kind of boring, but that also makes it easier to follow, so take the good with the bad."
5,The Get Rich Quick Club,"My opinion on The Get Rich Quick Club is 5 stars out of 5 stars because there are funny parts and a surprise at the end. The plot is is a whole bunch of kids about 5 want to get rich. So they made a business out of the kid's initials, the initials standed for The Get Rich Quick Club. They didn't know what to do so they brainstormed ideas. Then they figured it out. They decided to fake a U.F.O picture. So they tried to put it in the newspaper. Then a guy rejected the picture because he knew it was fake. Then you will be surprised what happens next."
2,poor relationship with money,"I'm a mom with a family of boys, and we read a lot. We really liked Dan Gutman's book ""Satch and Me."" However, in contrast to that book, ""The Get Rich Quick Club"" is a turn-off.The lead character in this book, Gina, is an eleven year old who professes to LOVE money. And she wants to get a lot of it. Sooo... she sets out to scam her town, and eventually the entire country. Plenty of adults knowingly help her in her scam, and of course in the end she becomes discredited. Funny ending that plays on ""the boy who cried wolf.""It's an entertaining book, but there are some problems with language and ethics:- comments like ""anything fun costs money;""- calling people ""stupid"" 20 different ways in Australian slang;- replacement curse words (dang, darn, heck);- advice like""If you ever get caught in a lie, don't admit it. Just say, ""I forgot;""- sassing parents.This is a poor choice, values-wise, of a book for my kids."
2,"well, knowledge is power","It's never a bad thing to obtain information. This documentary speaks about how actors began putting their footprints and signatures around Grauman's Chinese Theater. Raquel Welch narrates and I am glad she got this opportunity to do something new.If you watch, you'll pick up facts. Lucille Ball doesn't have a square. Charlie Chaplin's square was lost. Whoopi Goldberg had some of her locks printed in her square. Michael and Kirk Douglas are the only father and son team to have squares.Still, this work drags after awhile. It gets tired seeing Actor X make his mark, then Actor Y, then Z, ad infinitum. It is either thin on facts or the facts don't really take that much time to tell. The focus here is on old Hollywood. There is much more Rock Hudson and Marilyn Monroe than Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Perhaps this work will be enjoyed by seniors more younger viewers."
4,Outstanding,"This book (and no doubt its volumes 2 and 3 to follow) provides us with a well-needed checklist of the snakes of the world, including all the synonyms ever used for them.The order in which the snakes are presented is a bit arbitrary, but the reason for that is rather practical, and explained in the preface.I would like to have (at least) the English names mentioned somewhere. It wouldn't scare off foreigners, as has been shown by the long-term ""Check-list of Birds of the World"", which is of the same outstanding class.I would have preferred to have an overall index at the end of Volume 3, but on the other hand it would have left us without an index for many years, as the finalization of the next volumes will take a long time.All in all: this a book a serious herpetologist can't afford to miss."
2,Dalmation Slippers,These slipper are VERY cute. My little girl has had them about 6 months and one of the soles is coming off. Seems like a sewing issue that others are having with these slippers also. They need a better QA deparment
3,Inexpensive parental TV control,"I use this switch to limit the hours my 10-year-old daughter can watch TV. Here's how it works:- From the wall outlet for the cable TV service, a length of coaxial cable is connected to one of the ""IN"" terminals of the switch. The other ""IN"" terminal is not connected to anything.- From the terminal marked ""TV SET"" another coaxial cable is connected to my TV set.- The switch is mounted out of sight, but within easy reach, under my desktop.When I don't want her to watch TV, I slide the switch off (toward the unused terminal). If she turns on the TV, there is only snow on the screen.""Gee honey, the cable service isn't working. Why don't you do your homework now, and try the TV again later.""- When I'm willing to permit TV watching, I slide the switch the other way.So far, she hasn't caught on."
5,Great little switch,"This item was about the same price as at Walmart, but I added it onto an order I was going to place anyway and saved the tax. The switch feels substantial in the hand, not light and cheap. That probably doesn't make a difference in actual performance, but it feels better than some pot metal switch. As far as performance, I did not have any problem whatsoever. Hooked it up and the slide switch moves positively and changes between cable and air smoothly. Good item."
1,Junk,Worked just fine for a couple of months. Now when I switch from cable to antenna the picture quality gets snowy. I have to bang on it to get a clear picture again. You get what you pay for.
5,Great for warming up water for baby bottles on the go,I used this as a water warmer to make formula bottles for my baby and it was a wonderful and highly useful product! my kids were picky about wanting warm milk and that is sometimes difficult while traveling/on the go. I recommend this product!
2,The Unspoken Truth (True Stories Collection),"I was disappointed in this film, especially with the good actors. It is not something I would buy had I seen the film beforehand."
3,Worked for a While,"I added these to my tub/shower while my wife was pregnant to help her grip. They lasted through her pregnancy, but shortly there-after the tread part of the appliqué began to slip and separate from the color and glue backing. They're really only good for short term use."
2,Came off after a couple of weeks,"This have a cool design. However, even though my husband was very careful and followed the instructions carefully, they came off way too soon, just a few weeks. We were very disappointed because we liked the design."
1,Creepy,This needs to be pulled from the sale list! It would be creepy to watch this after finding out about the abuse that was really taking place at this orphanage during the time of this filming. Sickening!
1,Product Review - Very Poor,"Not much to really say about this product. The craftsmanship of the camera is shotty, at best. The signal strength is very poor. The distance between receiver and camera is less then 20ft with battery, and no more then 50ft with ac adapter. The image quality is that of a cameraphone from the early 2000s. For $45, you will get the absolute bottom of the line equipment."
5,Great pants,My husband loves these pants! They are much less stiff than other similar pants. True to size. Great fit. Recommend to anyone!
2,meh,"not so much, quality seemed fine but the cut made me look like a took a poo. I felt like the like the crotch was cut low."
4,End of first season!,"You only get 75 min. And now that an 8 DVD set is coming out that covers first and second season you kind of wonder if it is worth it. It is if you are a collector of postcards. Show 35 does NOT have Kero comments at the end. Sigh, I hope that does not signal the future. Also does not come with a preview of show 36 as it says on the inside either."
5,3 great season enders,"Usually there are 4 episodes on these DVDs but this one only has three because these are the final three of season one. All take place around Christmas time, a romantic holiday in Japan. Sakura's relationship with Yukito becomes more than merely ""he's the big brother's friend"" as they cooperate in a contest and spend his birthday at an amusement park. Most importantly Sakura's dreams are further revealed and we have a clear set-up for season two. Also these are the last Kero Checks at the end of the show: he cries, how sad!"
2,Not as advertised - fire the marketing weasel that drafted the cover text!,"I have a Denon SACD/DVD-A player that i just moved, and needed to setup again. While I have other disks with reference tones for setup, but not specifically DVD-A, I came across this Denon disk with DVD-A selections, and thought I'd give it a try. I'm no expert at audio setup, and when I read on the package that the disk offered ""complete instructions on how to setup and evaluate your 5.1 Surround playback system,"" I bought it.The selections are nice, though they don't sound very good on my system - perhaps I need to set it up with the disk! However, the ""complete instructions"" on ""how to setup"" and ""evaluate"" are nothing more than a note referring you to your player's manual!When I calm down and find some decent instructions on how best to use the test tones, I'll run the audio checks and see how they compare to the others that I have. And see if the sound improves.But future buyers beware."
2,Informative but not a winner,Nostalgia has some interesting footage. The Atacama scenes are haunting. The Pinochet references are too incomplete. The personal anecdotes while interesting don't complete the tale. The philosophical rants are trite.
4,A good bargain,"My daughter likes this DVD. Especially the Sabrina shows. As a parent, I thought this was a great deal money wise. The animation is quite good with brilliant colors."
5,"Loved her in the '60's, love her MORE now!","Judy Henske was one of my favorite singers in the '60's and '70's but kind of dropped off my radar with the death of vinyl.One day I decided to look her up on the internet and WOW! Not only was she still kickin', she had put out a new album plus almost all the old stuff was now on CD. This is the second of her new albums and I hope there are more to come.As to why I like her better now--most of the songs are original on both the new albums and she's as much poet as singer."
3,Animal learning tool,Good start for discussions of caring for animals and how the buffalo's were once carelessly killed off. How buffalos represented the American west and sustained the Indians.
3,Blue R Racing Car Mat,"Product filled the need to cover old dirty carpet in car. 2 years later, they are still in good shape. Well made, although you need to wash them occassionally to maintain good looks. Some paint is worn off."
3,the real item is same size as web image,"I gave for 3 stars, because the item size is real small. I thought it will be much bigger size."
3,Pretty good,"I honestly only needed some cd cases for xmas gifts I made, so I didn't need super fancy cases, so these were perfect for that. Delivery was a little slower than usual, but I wasn't in a hurry. All around they are pretty good."
4,Worth it for one song,"Harry Connick Jr's version of ""You Go To My Head"" with a simple standing bass accompaniment and the later addition of Kirk Whalum's sax is, as promised, the ""sexiest thing you're gonna hear""."
1,Too old,"The book itself contains some wisdom, but the legibility of the photocopy used to reproduce the text makes reading a heavy and unprofitable chore. If the original text can be updated to a legible copy, then I would read it. At this point, I would not recommend this edition."
2,Doesn't fit all 1911's with Rail,"Was given this as a gift to use with my GSG 1911 with Rail. However, the rail hangs slightly too low and the gun won't fit at all. Probably works with other 1911 style guns, but if you have the GSG 1911 with rail, steer clear!"
5,Must be read before the D-Day!,"If you plan to get a Mal, you should buy this book before.Very good information for the new owner.Best for the price, very accurate and up to date with new owner concern."
1,Don't Purchase,"My wife and I spent three hours with two DVD players trying to get the DVD to navigate and play correctly. As two other reviewers stated, it goes to the Spanish language portion and into latter lessons. We were unable to get the program to function correctly. I can not recommend this course of instruction to anyone."
3,Guitar Lessons,I would start with a book about basic guitar before you purchase this one. Must have some background on basics to learn from this DVD.
1,Not good,I'm not a big fan of dvd tutorials to begin with but this was like learning math after taking acid.
5,Good Intro,"This DVD is great. Good explanations, good introduction. It is as it says for the new beginner. However, an experienced viewer won't be disappointed either.Cheer, and thanks"
4,Fenders Electric Guitar DVD,"My son enjoys this video, he can understand what the teacher is teaching. I would recommend for beginners."
2,Not for Beginners,"I bought this cd for my grandson, based on reviews. I found it very difficult for beginners. I think they assume that you have a basic knowledge. I guess I assumed incorrectly, that this was for beginners. Would not recommend for beginners"
3,Barre chords are hard,"I am a beginner, and I am trying to figure out how to use this DVD. Unlike other online tutorials, near the beginning of the lessons he introduces barre chords. I can understand that moving up the neck using barre chords is very efficient, but I am new to this and find that I cannot play these chords. The spread my fingers need to take, and the pressing of multiple strings with one finger is just beyond me right now. I find myself looking to some online sites for easier alternate ways to learn chords. I wish he made barre chords a more advanced topic and introduced us to easier alternate fingerings early on. Also, navigating the DVD is not so easy. Sometimes I find it difficult to go back to earlier sections and have to restart the DVD."
5,BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,"Great DVD. Easy to follow. Keith is the best. I have other DVD's on how to play the guitar, However this is by far the best. I have played acoustic for 2 years. For the beginner Keith even teaches you how to operate your amp. This is not stated in the DVD advertisement. All I can say is, ""If you are just starting with the electric BUY THIS DVD."""
1,Same Problem As All Other Bad Reviews,"Just like all other reviewers with problems, the menu in English meant the lessons were in Spanish. The menu in Spanish gave lessons in English. However, playing the basic beginner portion resulted in a complete shutdown of the DVD. I bought this despite the bad reviews. I thought perhaps they were the minority. Then I reread the good reviews. They sound like advertisements. I highly suspect they are paid reviews (this is a common practice) and are from people who never even saw the DVD. I contacted the company and Amazon. If things are fixed I will amend this revew. In the mean time I do not recommend this product at all."
4,"Good DVD, get a good beginner book first",The dvd is great and show you a lot of different techniques. It is a difficult dvd for a beginner but if you stick to it you will learn a lot of good techniques without paying someone. It takes a lot of practice with the dvd but the looping practice tracks actually make it easy. I would recommend this dvd.
3,"""Getting Started""?","I'm a beginner and for me this DVD is hard to follow now matter how many times I watch it, there are things that I can't understand when he talks about steps and stuff. I'll keep it maybe one day I'll have enough background to understand it."
3,Guitar DVD Review,"I bought this DVD for my 10 yr old son who is learning electric guitar. I really like the commentator. He explains things clearly and concisely and has good demeanor. The learning program is well laid out. If one were to complete all activities on this DVD, you would be well on your way to playing electric guitar. However, the program is more conducive for an adult or older teen. The program doesn't have any simple songs to practice and most of the exercises are too difficult for my son. I'm now searching for other, simpler guitar resources."
1,beginner player,I feel the same way all the other one star reviewers felt. I wish I had read their reviews before I purchased this worthless DVD. It changes languanges [ Spanish } mostly. Hard to follow and stay on any track. Didn't learn a thing. Totally worthless for any guitar player let alone a beginner....Don't waste your money...Trust me and the others..keep on looking... I don't see how anyone could rate this any higher ...All the others must have got a cut of the profits...Fender should be ashamed to put their stamp on it.
1,Definitely Not for Beginners,"This may very well be a good book, simply not for beginners. I purchased this book and it is over my head. If you have some experience playing the guitar, maybe this book is for you. For the person that knows absolutely nothing (BEGINNERS) about playing the guitar it is definitely the wrong book to start with."
2,bad motor,"This is a nice screen with a smooth, quiet motor -- however after maybe a month, the motor rolls the screen up and doesn't stop turning. Perhaps we just got a lemon, but be aware that this may be a problem"
1,Round goggles,"Round goggles do not fit little faces! The goggles leak as they do not set correctly for a young child's face. My daughter's are 3 and 5 and we had to replace these goggles with the more oval shape. They may work for an older child, but not for a little one."
1,Would give zero stars if I could,Uncomfortable and do not keep any of the water out. The shape isn't right for kid faces. Only has one strap in the back and no way to make it fit comfortably. Wish I read reviews before I bought.
4,"Tasty, a way to reduce cholesterol","I find this a tasty product, as is the original non-reduced fat. It still has a lot of fat, if that's your issue. Not mine (I choose where to spend my fat calories), so I had a little non cholesterol margarine when I fry it and it comes out good. Very hard to find at my local stores."
5,Excellent product,"I have found this hash an excellent quick meal, going particularly well with steamed cabbage or broccoli and applesauce. It is filling, not too fat, and well seasoned."
3,Hormel Reduced Fat Corned Beef Hash,I thought that I was really going to love this product but I do not to tell the truth. Most people will probably like this product but I did not like it. Sorry. It arrived in good condition and it was fresh though. I just did not like the taste.
3,"Hormel Reduced Fat Corned Beef Hash, 15-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)",I don't like the taste. I don't feel the beef.. But servings in can is great...:):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):):) :):)
4,Better than full fat corned beef!,We have been purchasing this since we first discovered this lower fat version. My husband and I find it more flavorful than the regular corned beef.
4,Dewalt Recon Tools,Once again I am completely satisfied with a Dewalt Reconditioned tool. I picked up a second battery and a better blade and I'm very pleased with the power and the quality of cut.
1,"Crap, wish I could give it zero stars!!!","A worthless book from a worthless writer. Please self-proclaimed writer, don't put us through any more of this crap. I am ashamed that Amazon is even selling this crap. Save your time and sanity!! A horrible, ridiculous plot paired with a hideous writing style= crap!"
3,Universal?? Remote,"Could not get the remote to work on my DirecTV box (HD-DVR...HR20-100). Even tried searching for code by pushing the power button >300 times (as suggested in the instructions). This probably controls lots of products, just not the ones I need."
3,It gets an alright review,"The remote finder worked well the first time we used it. The remote itself does not work very well. You will have to keep programming it with the universal code. The keychain finder usually has to be in a close range in order to find the remote, so you will find yourself moving about a lot trying to find the remote. But my boyfriend loved it as a gift because he is constantly losing the remote in his bed, and for someone who refuses to use a remote caddy its the perfect gift. A word of advice: since the remote that came with the remote control device does not work very well, we taped the keychain to the back of our DVR remote. So we use the remote control (that came with the keychain) to find our primary remote (the DVR remote) and it works perfectly."
1,World's worst product!!!!,"The point of the product is that you may locate SIX(6) devices with it! Yet, you only receive one(1) device locator key ring and NO-ONE, not Amazon, the shipping company not even General Electric knows where the other five device locator key rings may be puchased!"
3,Classic Norris,"A good solid movie, with all the usual 'Chicago Gang', that you see in so many movies shot in Chicago (Above the Law, Fugitive, etcc....). Chuck kicks butt big-time, and Henry Silva plays a great villian. If you like Chuck, you'll love this one. Just one question-'Does this guy ever age'?"
4,Bob's favorite tv actor,Chuck Norris was a favorite of my husband. It was purchased for him. Chuck Norris is an ok tv actor but I don't care that much for him. I watched them all with my husband and they are good but his roles are just not what I like. I am not a big martial arts fan but Norris is very good at it. Personally I do admire his help he has given to underprivilaged children. We need a lot of people like him showing the kids better ways than gangs.
1,It doesn't work!,"When I opened the video, it told me it ""wasn't authorized for my area."" Then why did you sell it to me??? Come on, Amazon! Give us a break with the small print on stuff."
2,"I'll never tell , oh go on then .","strangely enough , in this film chuck plays a tough guy cop . A cop who refuses to let anything stand in his way . While in line at the drive through ,he gets into a fight with a pick up truck ,the truck knows a thing or two about martial arts too ,and chuck only manages to win by threatning to have a shave . He also battles the mob ,and he insults the boss by pointing out that Frank Sinatra was short . There's car chases and tap dancing penquins . Gun fire and a pair of red slippers , that recite shakespeare . My grandmother took me to see this one , when she was out on bail , so I would recomend it to constipated traffic wardens , that wear barbed wire underpants ."
5,Norris' Best Film,"Code of Silence is by far Chuck Norris' best film. Not only is it great by the standards of his martial arts action films, but is actually a cut above many action pictures.Norris plays a Chicago cop who finds himself caught between a turf war between the Mafia and a Colombian drug cartel. His standing on the force suffers at the same time because he testifies against two cops who are involved in a bad shooting. The Code of Silence ends up being double-pronged - one side being the Mafia's Code of Silence, and the other being the police force's Code of Silence against bad behavior by their own.Directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed Above The Law, Under Siege and The Fugitive, Code of Silence has great action sequences and a great villain in Henry Silva. This is Norris' finest film. Nothing he has done before or since has been anywhere near as good."
5,Great book for a learner,"I am living in a place now where I cannot find a Yoga Guru for around 50 miles, who can teach me yoga.I visualized God Siva as my Guru in my mind and started reading the book.Book contains great visuals and easy explanations.I have chosen to practice breathing exercises (chapter 1), sun salutations (chapter 5) and namahah meditation (chapter 4). I have great peace of mind and calmess. All the agitation I had earlier left me.I am yet to read and practice other chapters. I will update this review whenever I complete the same.In the mean time, I award five stars.."
5,Very Useful,"I have read and used many yoga books/manuals over the years, and this is by far the best one I've seen. It has an excellent UI and information in simple and direct form. Maybe--hopefully--this is the one that will make me a true devotee."
3,Desert One from the Air Force Perspective,"This is the story of the April 1980 hostage rescue mission into Iran written by the USAF MC-130 commander. There are many interesting insight into the mission planning, including intelligence gaps and Kyle follows the development of the plan from conception to execution. One particularly odd item is the overconfidence that Desert One was a deserted area, when even the pre-raid reconnaissance mission saw signs of activity. COL Beckwith, Delta commander, appears as an inflexible jackass who can't back off by even one man from his 130-man force for an embassy takedown. The plan always appeared flawed and attempting to do too much with helicopters. Even if the force had gotten to Tehran it is apparent that the extraction plan was overly-optimistic and likely to turn into a debacle. Maps adequate."
3,An honest account of the failed mission.,"This is how the mission was actually planned from the day the hostages were taken through to the tragic end in the desert. I know because I was one of the KC-135 planners and participants. Because of the lessons learned, the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) was formed. That task force evolved into the United States Central Command (CENTCOM)which is in charge of military operations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia."
1,Way over priced,"This collectible is way overpriced for what you get. Cheap cardboard box that does not even have a window flap to view the figure, you have to open the box to see it which is not usually something people like to do with a collectible. The figure itself is a sold blob of plastic no articulation or paint apps to speak of. I would say this item cost about $5 to produce in China and it looks it, it's a dullgray not shiny like the character or picture here.If you can find it for $25-$30 then buy it, that's all it's worth."
3,"Great idea, but...","I'm a classical guitarist who's been struggling over the past couple of years with symptoms of focal dystonia. I ordered this product (not through Amazon) about two months ago and I have to say that it really works. It's helped me to regain strength and independence in my middle and ring fingers and has also eliminated the numbness, tingling and pain that I worried was the start of carpal tunnel syndrome. The down side of this product is that the rubber bands supplied with it are very flimsy and both of mine snapped at the thumb within six weeks of my purchasing this item. I haven't yet contacted the manufacturer, so I can't say anything yet about the quality of their customer service, but in the meantime I'm improvising with a set of flat rubber bands that are considerably more comfortable and durable than the ones provided."
3,could be better,not as effective as I thought it would be for extension of the fingers and rubber holes for the fingers twist up on you :(A Simple RUBBER Band work just as well!!!
2,motion sickness,"There are 2 workouts on this dvd--a yoga workout, and a core essentials workout.The continuous camera movement for the yoga portion makes me feel ill. So, the rare times that I view this dvd, I try to avoid looking at the screen. Unfortunately, I can still see the screen out of the corner of my eye. The music is of the ballet-piano variety, which I am not the biggest fan of. The instructor breezes a little too fast through the poses, and her voice sounds like Jenny Jones's--this I wish I had known before I bought the dvd.The core essentials portion of the dvd is strange--the instructor starts off with this weird speed floor aerobics. Then I realize that in order to do the workout, one needed to have purchased this weighted little ball (a catalog and order form is 'conveniently' included inside the dvd) from her store. Voight doesn't even suggest modifications in the event you do not have this ball, which I found annoying.There are much better yoga dvds out there."
3,just ok,"Not the greatest workout DVD in my collection.I still do it sometimes, but it's not in high rotation.I don't like that you need props for some, but you can still do them without the props."
2,very bad,"This work out was very poor. its bad.. it is very slow moving. And as another review stated Karen is very cut and shows that off well, but she did not get it form this workout. it was disappointing at best!"
1,careful when you buy this,If you are after a DVD this is not for you. This is just an audio disc with some crap still photos showing on your DVD player screen. Sellers should be a lot more clear about this when advertising... this should not ever be under DVD titles.
3,"Interesting perspective, but can be slow reading...","I was disappointed in Burke's writing style. I was hoping it would be much more breezy, direct, and to-the-point. Perhaps I expected too much, having been introduced to Burke and CONNECTIONS via the television series.The proposal that people, ideas, inventions, and events are connected across the history of time and man is intriquing. The facts Burke presents are interesting, yet mired at times in too much detail. The casual, non-scientifically knowledgable types (like me) face some slow, rough reading at points.By the end, though, where Burke ties-in and connects his major ideas, you'll have enjoyed the trip you took through history.... just be prepared to take your time getting there."
2,Nothing at all like the Connections television show...,"I was first exposed to James Burke's Connections series via TDC, TLC, or PBS (I'm not sure which channel it ran on). I also read his column in Scientific American. I loved these works and quickly snapped up this book when I first ran across it.Boy, was I disappointed! This book is nothing at all like the series. It neglects to start with a specific topic, link it to what appears to be a totally unrelated topic, and then come full circle back to the original topic. The book would be best described as a collection of trivia but in no way is it presented with the same flair as the series or column.The worst part of this book for me was that it appeared to be choppy in certaing parts, due I suspect to the edition updates.Try it if you dare but don't expect the same Connections as the series or column!"
2,No information,I really enjoyed this series in the early 90s. The Amazon information doesn't provide sufficient detail and it is in a format that is not usable in the U.S.
5,Nicely priced and good quality,"I have a wall phone in my laundry room and did not like having to stay within 2 feet of the phone in order to use it. I also did not want to spend much to put a longer handset cord on there, either, especially since it is in the laundry room. When I found this one for a few pennies over three bucks and free shipping (prime), I had to go for it. Although another reviewer said it was not a good quality cord, I did not find that to be true. It is serving its intended purpose and doing so quite well."
2,Merely average,"I was expecting a better quality, but is was not to be.The sellers were very pleasant, though."
1,didn't work with Panasonic phone of the same order,"I ordered a Panasonic KX-TS105W Corded Phone, White but wanted a longer cord to go with it. This one was recommended. It did not work with the new Panasonic phone nor with any of the other 2 phones in our house. I thought it was just defective so I ordered another one. It, too, did not work. I finally ordered a Leviton Cord C2407-15W and it works fine. Strange."
1,lasted 4 months,I've only had this cord for about 4 months and there is already so much static that I have to tell people I'll call them back from my cell phone in order to hear them. Now I'm back on Amazon searching for another brand that carries 25 ft cords since none of the brick and mortars around me do. I don't even use the house phone that much and this cord only lasted 4 months... can you imagine if it was used every day?
1,horrible quality!,"I used this cord with my new phone and no one could hear me clearly. So, I dug the old cord out of the trash that I had discorded with the old phone, and I could be heard perfectly! HORRIBLE product!"
1,DOA Handset Cord,I should have read all the reviews before purchasing this. The cord was Dead on Arrival. I have a GE phone. If this GE cord was ever going to work it should work with a GE phone. I have apparently thrown away the packaging it came in and so will not bother to send it back. . . unless I find the info. I'll just go down to the Dollar store and buy one for $4.95. I am usually 100% satisfied with Amazon products. Guess I was due for disappointment.Update: This was wthe wrong cord reviewed. The one I purchased was a GE 25 ft cord. Don't know how this got so mixed up. Sorry.
4,Kitchen Gadget,"Needed to reach across the kitchen and this works great for that. Only issue is it does not match the ""white"" of the phone."
4,Makes phone calls easier,I like these long cords as they allow me to get away from the wall phone and sit on the couch to comfortably chat.I found it to be a bit more tightly coiled than my previous brand but trust it will stretch out a bit more over time
1,I'drather slit my ears than listening this one,"is this a copy of VAN HALEN's David ""diamond"" Lee Roth or Brian Johnson's AC/DC? from the first tune you will know that the man who becomes a singer, is an idiot!My advice:go & listen to the legendary hard rock classic bands such as Deep purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, King Crimson, ELP, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Genesis.....they will not ever be forgotten in the next 50 years, but who will still remember the DARKNESS in the next 3 years??"
3,Not what I expected.,"The first thing I noticed about this video was that you didn't had it on a DVD format.The second was that it was played on GRASS.The third, the video is too expensive for what it has to offer.First of all I thought the video was going to show Bocce being played on grass and flannel surfaces simultaneously.We live in a retirement community and all Bocce games or tournaments are done or played on FLANNEL SURFACES.WE HAVE NO LAWN BOCCE, therefore most of your lessons or tips in the video does not apply to us.I was hoping the video would have demonstrated the proper grip and ball release and or delivery, which of course changes from that of lawn bocce when played in flannel surfaces.I will only recommend this video to someone who wants to learn how to play LAWN BOCCE.The history on how Bocce first started was interesting and thethe Bocce rules were easy to understand and easy to follow.Maria Heydenburg"
4,I'm in Fanfare,I was actually one of the people that was chosen to have their story published in Fanfare. It was a highlight for me to be recognized in this way for being a fan of one of my most favorite bands.In this book you read about others experiences and have it verified that DMB are truly the people that we envision them to be.
1,Terrible Romance,"This book was truly awful and unnecessarily violent. The actions of the heroine were not believable. For example, after being gang-raped by a group of outlaws, the heroine finds it in herself to make out with the hero (even though she doesn't know him). Further credibility challenges come up surrounding the death of her children. Finally, the hero and heroine fall in love without any apparent reason. The author never shows the two falling in love, they merely do in the first couple of chapters of the book. The rest of the story centers around violence, murder, and rape. This is no romance."
2,Inferior product,"As others have said, this gum:-is very hard initially, and even after some chewing has poor texture and elasticity-Flavor is weak at best, and disappears quickly. Doesn't really taste that great to begin with.-After about 5-10 minutes it tastes bad enough to discardFor energy gum, I'd rather go with Jolt. Chocolate covered espresso beans are also a good alternative.I've had penguin caffeinated mints in the past, which were quite good, but this product was very disappointing. $5 for 8 containers seemed too good to be true."
1,So Called Gum Sucks,"The ""gum"" is as hard as a rock and the taste lasted seriously for only about a minute. Don't waste your money."
3,Has potential but needs work,"I like the flavor initially, including the coating. But it looses taste and texture too fast for me, like withing the first minute. Any extra energy I feel from this gum comes from annoyance that the flavor and texture disintigrate so quickly."
5,Amazing,This album is just amazing. Buy it and if you have enough money buy When Its Dark and Its Summer.
3,Impression,"The content is good, The CD's are good.Sadly, I have to report that the book is not well cut.I have to tear apart almost all the pages to be able to look at them.Very pity :(."
2,Funky funk,"On the positive side this book gives insight into the development of the whole soul/funk thing that James Brown was the king of. The notation and tab seem accurate to my ears and I love the fact that you get guitar, bass, and drums. The big negative that you will find is the notation is limited to major themes/riffs of each song. You do not get complete versions of anything, which for me was a great disappointment. Perhaps I should have read the description much better or something like that. If you want to learn the ""Feel"" and ""Style"" that Brown used and understand that about this book you should be OK with it. I am not, I wanted to learn the funk!"
4,How a Rhythm Section Works,"Really a great book. Has a bit of interesting history about James Brown.Really breaks down the interplay between drums, guitars, and bass on JB's band. Also provides some insight into the different bassists during JB's career. Finally, really provides a good description of the rhythmic interaction between the drummer and bassist.If you want the FUNK - start here."
4,I Was Captivated!,To me it was a read regarding subjects so wordly yet done in a manner where I didn't need to read trash words or visualize the crimes in vulgar detail. I'm amazed it can be written and read with the same impact and without all that comes with the topics this book deals with. Kept moving and fascinating the whole way! Thanks and that is why I'm here looking for another one. Goes to show you can read about the world and yet not have to skips words you know is coming by most authors.
4,Appearance of Evil,A real suspense thriller that keeps you guessing til the very end. This is the second book by Christopher A. Lane that I have read and I couldn't put either one of them down!
5,Great Tune!,I luv the Celtic feel of it! My Irish-Step dance teacher used this song in our dance recital. We did a reel to it.
2,"These are LONG johns, for tall folk","I got these in the 32-34 waist, and they were much longer than any other thermals I'd ever had. If you're very tall, this might be what you're looking for, but if you have a more average build, these will be annoyingly long. They should be advertised as being extra long. Then they would deserve more stars. As it is, if people buy these expecting the usual length, they will be disappointed.(As for the seller, Panda, they were okay but not great. I had ordered a few pairs. Although they did not charge me restocking, they would only take back the ones that were still sealed, I could not return the pair I had opened to try on. They said that it was a health law, but other companies do take such returns. And especially since they are typically worn over regular underwear, just like blue jeans, I don't know why there should be any such issue.)"
4,A lost gem...,"Lost for many years this short film, just over one hour, is great for students of Cuban history and Flynn fans. Loads of long lost footage of the revolution in Havana and beyond. As a journalist resident in Havana from 1993-1999 it hold special interest to me as I can see my old apartment building there!A great buy for those interested in the subject or the film maker - less so for the general viewer."
4,Intersting snapshot of Cuban Revolution,"If you're thinking about buying this because of Errol, forget it. He only appears briefly, and indeed he is not the narrator. Also, if you love him, you might find it painful to see him in his later days of poor health. No, the real reason to buy this is because it has some unique footage of the Revolution and expresses a point of view you seldom encounter in media of the time. It was interesting because of that and worthwhile in its obviously subjective-historic narrative."
3,Interesting Love Poem to Castro,"Film is the late Errol Flynn's love poem to Castro and the Cuban Revolution. DVD could have been better if it included Cuban Rebel Girls. Mostly, Flynn embarrasses himself by once again playing journalist, something he had done before with mixed results. Much the footage is fascinating to see even with the pro-Castro love poem. The liner notes seem to rely on Charles Higham's discredited biography but does make George Raft more of a hero than the reprobate Flynn, who just looks god awful for a man of 50. Flynn died soon after his misadventures in Castro land."
2,ERROL IN LATE YEARS,"THERE ARE ONLY 2 REASONS TO BUY THIS,FIRST IF YOU WANT TO SEE A FEW BRIEF GLIMPSES OF ERROL IN HIS LATE YEARS,SECOND THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWSREEL FOOTAGE,IT'S PLODDING AND UNFORTUNATELY IN HINDSIGHT WRONG IN ITS THOUGHTS ON FIDEL,FURTHERMORE THE NARRATION IS DEFINITELY NOT ERROL'S VOICE"
2,Used car salesman,"In a way an interesting film, more due to the circumstances when it was shot. I have never seen any Errol Flynn movie, but it is clear that he should have stayed away from doing anything else than rephrasing manuscripts prepared by the more gifted. The scenes might be of some historical interest, but similar (scenes) can be seen in other movies, with competent analyses.The movie doesn't explain anything whatsoever about the revolution and doesn't provide any insights - it is obviously made by people not up to the task. Like a used car salesman explaining the functionality of a Boing 747.Take your hard earned money and spend it on something else like the film ""Fidel"". I can only recommend it for nostalgia. The only thing possible to learn is about the dubious character Flynn himself."
2,a fun book about Charleston,"My husband saw this on my wish list on Amazon and ordered it for me. It's a cute book but not necessarily historic. More like recipes, styles, decorating, etc. It's OK for a fun book but not if you want something historic."
4,A good sequal to The Secret Garden!,"I liked this sequal a good bit,but I think it lacks something.It doesn`t seem to have the magical Secret Garden touch to me!It`s worth seeing,but probably not buying!It`s not great,but it`s not horrible either!"
4,slightly disappointed,"I watched the movie 3x now,I was saddened to see she was married to Colin. The house and garden had too many changes."
1,this movie does not play!,The dvd does not play on any players in the house. Pretty frustrating when you pay for something that doesn't work!
3,Just okay,"I watched this because I wanted to see how the original characters of A Secret Garden held up. The characters are mentioned briefly or are in small roles here and it really isn't necessary to know the original story to enjoy this film. This film treats the secret garden as magical as the garden door simply disappears when the door is shut. Overall the story is cute, the actors are sweet, but the garden itself is disappointing."
2,Kate Maberly even in this?,"I would have prefer Kate Maberly to play Mary! As an adult now, and would have loved to see how the characters grew up. And to see the original Mary not the exchangeable one. Hmmm I haven't seen this but I'm terribly dissapointed that she did not return to The Secret Garden. And the first one had purpose, does this one have purpose? Some one let me know--- Thanks"
1,"Dull, Boring, Pointless and Incestuous","I loved The Secret Garden and have watched it several times and was excited to watch Back to the Secret Garden. OMG! what a disappointment. Very boring, dull and pointless. I forced myself to watch the entire movie. Not to mention first cousins of identical twin mothers marrying! It's a good thing they bore no offspring. What a genetic mess they would have been (in theory) as the movie was a mess (in reality)."
2,Korean keyboard sticker,"The stickers were extremely hard to remove from the card. I had to use a razor blade to remove each symbol. Also, they should have looked at the keyboard to determine the exact location of letters instead of printing dead center. Symbols were covering the english letters."
1,Keyboard stickers for Korean Han-gul alphabet.,"These stickers appear to be okay. But there were no instructions included to help me know which keytop each was to be stuck on.I am learning Han-gul, and do not know this yet. As a true beginner, I need these stickers, but they do me no good without instructions on where to place them."
3,What do you expect from a fairy tale?,"I read this for a class. The story was short, the long winded analysis long."
3,A mutually inspiring duo! ........Brad Terry's whistling detracts from recording'!,"Virtuosos, pianist Roger Kellaway and bassist Red Mitchell, make for a perfectly complementary and mutually inspiring duo on this set. They give inspired takes on six jazz standards, stretching out on ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Take the 'A' Train,"" and ""I'll Never Be the Same"" for over ten minutes apiece. Detracting from the recording is a 7 minuted version of Sonny Rollins' 'Doxy' with Brad Terry whistling(truly forgettable)!"
5,Huge surprise,What a surprise !A mate in England put me onto this CD and I have not stopped playing it.At $100+ here on Amazon I'd like to think you can buy this at another site for a decent price.Great prog rock from an early 1970s Australian band.
1,Not good at all.,"I'm sorry but 5 year old boys don't use the words this 'author' made him use. I'm finding it hard to continue reading this as the obvious Pit Bull hating moron decided to use THAT specific breed as a potential killer. Using the word 'dog' would suffice. If I see anymore about a Pit in this stupid story, I'm not finishing it and demanding a refund. End Rant."
2,NOT UP TO PAR......,"This was not my first book I have read by by Ms.Mitchell...and quite frankly, it's a good thing it wasn't. Her previous books i:e"", Sips of Blood (1999). Quenched (2000), Sirens Call 2004), and an excellent novel..'Street of Death (2007) all encouraged me that 'Witch' (2007) would be another satisfying read. What was she thinking!!?? This was not her first rodeo! Stephen, the main character, is five years old going on thirty. Absurd!! The entire premise of the story was akin to a Brothers Grimm fairy tale...(albiet adult, but fairy tale nonetheless,) Unless you are into little 'boogie man creatures' and nasty little witches and stupid snakes with a wry sense of humor...forget this book. I admit I did keep reading it hoping something would happen...I mean, something has Got to happen!! Well, forget it. As far as I'm concerned, this book is a waste of time. Read one of her others... Skip this one..............."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book was so good it was an eye opener to read a book on slavery that told the truth but did not seek to lay the blame on present day white America. I would discribe this book as a black self help,white awareness,secular, spiritual self help book.It is a must read for all Americans of every nationallity"
4,THE PROPHET,"I am look for the original publication 1923 of the prophet, khalil gibran, thank for the answer,"
2,Boring,"Let's see, how's this one go? In the company of some fanatical Jesuits, Saint-Germain goes on a state mission from Poland to Russia, abandons the mission, gets the dying madman Ivan the Terrible (guilt-stricken over slaying his own son and heir) fixated on his collection of gemstones, and then gets wrapped up in marriage (hey, after 3,500 years the man was bound to tie the knot sooner or later) with a traumatized Russian noblewoman whose relatives seek to take over the throne of Muscovy. Not a bad job on Yarbro's part as far as getting the terminology and xenophobic outlook of the era right but not much really happens in this slooooow 350 page novel."
4,Worked great for me...,"I must have the only v40 that has worked flawlessly.. I have owned my V40 for years. Copies fine. Faxes every week/every time. Paper feeds fine. Prints nice photos and text. I don't remember it ever jamming...The only issue I have with it is the cost of replacement ink. But, that's a general HP issue.."
1,OfficeJet V40 Review,"I was actually excited to get this printer since I owned one in the past and it lasted for years, however, when I bought and received this used printer it only made a couple of copies before it stopped working. So I am totally not happy with this item I purchased."
4,No problems at all,"I purchased the hp officejet v40xi printer 5 years ago. It is a refurbished model, but I have never had a problem with it. Copies great, faxes great, and scans photos great. Like one other review, it is a little noisy and shakes while printing, but otherwise no complaints."
4,Keeps things cold!,"This cooler at first look seemed very thin walled and kind of cheap. But after many outings, I can say that it keeps ice longer than many other coolers around, and is sturdy enough to survive camping trips and 4x4 adventures. The taller lid is great, giving much more capacity and the ability to store 2 ltrs upright. It is light weight no doubt, but does a good job at keeping you food cold. It may not last a lifetime, but the price is low enough to make it worth it."
4,coleman cooler,"i got this product even though i already own a similar one, cause it is tall enough for big bottles and wide enough for dinner plates"

3,Good book but a pain to read,"Great book but written in a way that isn't ""casual"" reader friendly. After reading a few pages my eyes tire and become heavy. Part of the reason for this is because the style of writing is very wordy and uses vocabulary that isn't typical often.I do not challenge the merit of this book in a scholarly stand point, but in a literary stand point, it leaves a lot to be desired. When I bought this book, I was hoping for something insightful and also fun to read, instead I find my self reading a book that feels like a wordy essay on Isaac Newton.My suggestion is to sample other books on the topic before buying this one, while keeping in mind its written style."
3,somewhat boring/GREAT documentation/outstanding author,"First, the book has GREAT documentation. It has many footnotes, etc. And Gleick is an outstanding author. However, I found the book somewhat boring, and it was a little difficult to finish. I was hoping to learn more of ""the man"" Newton. And I did. I just didn't learn enough. Perhaps there are other books that DO tell about ""the man"" Isaac Newton."
3,Nice Introduction,"This book is a quick read and gives a broad review of Newton's life. If you're looking for more than a surface understanding of Newton, this book wouldn't be the way to go. Still, it gave me some more background on him and his work and helped me learn some of the important topics needing further study. In addition, the author writes in a captivating style."
3,"Breezy, fast overview","This book reads like a longer version of an encyclopedia article with less details. It breathlessly jumps over large parts of Newton's life and doesn't spend very much time on the details. He relationship with Fatio was barely a chapter, but it's one of the most important parts of Newton's life. The man had a nervous breakdown after he left him, but it's barely mentioned!Overall, I can't say I was impressed with this book. I think the wikipedia article on Newton has more depth and insight than this book. I was disappointed.(Kindle edition)"
4,"Very, very good biography",Excellent biography really. Truly paints a good picture that Newton wasn't a man of the modern age of reason he helped create. Was a man of the medieval world though he transcended it in some ways.Not sure why I couldn't quite give it 5 stars. It just misses just a little bit somehow. I would give it 4.5 if I could. Still worthwhile insight into who Newton was and the times he lived in. Well done considering the paucity of direct info one has to work with from the 1600's.
2,A rather dry rendering of an amazing man's life,"Isaac Newton helped erect modern science by laying a sturdy base for the empirical understanding of the physical world. Gleick's treatment comes across as distressingly dry, seemingly focused on a few spats and grudges Newton carried for decades instead of his painstaking efforts and surmises that led to modern physics, optics, calculus, gravity and other immense elucidations. The book is also rather short on personal aspects of Newton's life aside from some pages devoted to his childhood and early collegiate years. At under 200 pages, perhaps I should have suspected as much. To say the least, the Notes, Sources and Index take up an additional 80 pages so this is no fault upon Mr. Gleick's scholarship but rather his story-telling. If you seek a driving narrative about one of the most fascinating humans to inhabit the Earth, I implore you to look elsewhere."
4,Good Biography,Very well written biography. It was interesting reading about the interaction between Newton and Hooke and how they could not stand one another. If you are interested about the life of Newton this would be a good read for you.
5,Interesting and well Written,"Gleick brought Newton's world to life in this tightly written biography. I felt, though, that it left a lot out. I am interested in reading other biographies of Newton because he seemed so fascinating. It is a glimpse at an amazing figure with some elucidation on science and the world of Newton's time.I felt that Gleick took some liberties in saying that Newton presented a fork in the road as far as the divorce of philosophy from science. That had been going on since Descartes, even if Descartes' science was mistaken philosophy wouldn't know the difference. Also, left out, was mention of Ovid's Metamorphosis as an alchemist's cookbook.Reading this I felt like I was reading a half hour summary of movie fragments of a 12 hour motion picture; but at least I still want to see the motion picture. I think there may be better biographies out there. I hope"
4,Easy and Informative Read,"Before getting started with the book Isaac Newton, I expected it to be boring read with a lot of confusing scientific information. To my surprise, it was quite easy and interesting. A lot of basic information that I was not familiar with and Gleick eased me into it. He does a real nice job of portraying Newton's attitude towards his studies and shows that Newton really was a genius. It is evident that Gleick has a lot of respect for Newton and his work and was able to show his readers the true essence of what Newton wanted out of his work. The book includes Newton's early life, the history during his life, and his findings and ideas. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves science or math and wants to try something new. You truly learn from this brilliant man and I was overall impressed."
4,Accessible Biography,"It is a pleasant irony that the biography of the author one of the most famously impenetrable mathematical tomes is so accessible. And by accessible, I don't mean simple or demeaning -- it is an enjoyable read of a mere 200 pages. Too often, biographers indulge themselves in long-winded openings, discussing the subjects ancestors, which usually have little to do with the subject at hand. Not with Gleick -- we pretty much jump right in, and start with Mr. Newton himself. Another pleasant diversion from the tradition of biographies of men 400-some years old is the lack of speculation. Like many of this age, or even older, much is not known about Newton, so Gleick intelligently just leaves it out. Other current biographies, most notably ""Gallileo's Daughter"" fill the gaps in the record with blatant speculation."
3,Flawed introduction,"This is quite an odd book, both illuminating and not. The work is narrowly focused on Newton's life, or rather what Gleick considers especially important moments in Newton's life. He discusses only glancingly the tumultuous events of the seventeenth century, and there is little of the social history of science that today is exemplified by Steve Shapin's work. There is also a strange quality to the discussion of what Newton actually discovered. Gleick has the outline right, but the details are murky: to be honest, I'm not certain that he can follow Newton's math--no dishonor there--and so he doesn't explain it well. A better choice would be one of Richard Westfall's books on Newton."
2,Disappointing for a big fan of Genius by Gleick,"I loved Gleick's biography of Richard Feynman, ""Genius"". So my expectations for this book on possibly the most important mathematical and scientific figure were very high. I was somewhat disappointed. This biography is a little short and seemed to need a little more meat. I did not feel that truly made the reader understand the importance of Newton's accomplishments. I thought there was a little too much on Newton's forays into other fields like philosophy, etc. Also a little too much on the political fights with other scientists and mathematicians."
4,An Insightful Look at a Monumental Figure,"Gleick's biography of one of Western Civilization's most influential figures is insightful and excellent in both its avoidance of cliches and sensationalism and its use of primary source material. While the book may seem esoteric to some, it does a fine job of tracking the process by which Newton slowly arrived at his three laws of motion as well as the Universal Law of Gravitation. Additionally, it explores some of the personality traits and, more often, flaws that lead newton to live a solitary and occasionally confrontational life. A good read for those who enjoy biography, history of science or an examination of the creative process within the scientific community."
2,Newton light,"If you want a quick overview of Isaac Newton this book is okay. If you want a real biography read ""Never at Rest"" by Richard Westfall."
3,Isaac Newton Lite,"Despite its title, this slim volume is no biography. While interestng and well-written, it is really an extended profile, with nearly a third of the book consisting of notes and acknowledgements (in a format no magazine would likely publish). At its listed price, it is no value."
3,Not so good,"James Gleick has written some excellent books -- Chaos and Genius, but this book fails to clear that bar.Inside the front flap of the dust cover it reads ""In this original, sweeping, and intimate biography, Gleick moves between a comprehensive historical portrait and a dramatic focus on Newton's significant letters and unpublished notebooks to illiminate the real importance of his work in physics, in optics, and in calculus."" In my opinion, the book fails to meet this objective. The biography and other information is superficial and far from initimate -- the book is a good introduction to basic facts but no more than that. His biography of Richard Feynman in Genius comes much closer to the goal of an intimate biography."
3,"Interesting, but not as rich as hoped for","I saw a PBS show recently that traced the history of E=MC2 and Newton featured heavily in it. I was so struck by his story, I wanted to read on. Evidently, the producers of the PBS show must have used this book as research since I learned very little new about Newton that the show didn't convey: obsessive, loaner, brilliant, ahead of his time. My critique of the book was that it dwelled a lot on Newton's accomplishments, but little on him. For instance, we learn at the end that he died a very wealthy man, but for the life of me, I couldn't tell you where Newton made his money."
4,Adequate,"Having read some rather heavy books in the past year on philosophers I was curious to read about the man that probably had more to do with creating Science and Math as somewhat separate from Philosophy. In my simple world I look at Philosophy largely at metaphysics and Science and Math as pertaining to the realm of matter and substance.This is a brief, in fact very brief story of Isaac Newton. Minus notes at the back it is less than 200 pages. I'd say this is a bare minimum when discussing both Newton's life and his work. It's interesting, moves quickly but for one looking for a bit more explanation on Newton's work with gravity, calculus, work at the Royal Society or the English Mint I thought it could have been a bit more thoughtful or deeply researched.Nonetheless it moved the needle for me as a curiosity seeker to continue to read and discover the great people who've shaped our world!"
3,Not enough Meat,"How can you sum up the life of Newton in roughly 190 pages. This is nothing but a pamphlet of one of the greatest lives of discovery the world has ever known. If your IQ is below 130 and you are looking for good reading go for it, but if you need meat and deeper substance about Newton, this is not where you look."
3,Kaiser La Forme Mini Springform pans w/stencils,"The springform pans are as I expected form Kaiser products but the stencils are ""cheesy"", being made from thin cardboard or plastic. These stencils will not last long. Having chosen Kaiser because they had stencils with the pans was a waste of money. Choose cheaper set and make your own stencils."
3,good but...,"Dont get me wrong, I am a huge Les Claypool fan, its just this album doesnt offer anything special. Its good, but, a little all too familiar for the Primus fanbase. If your a devotee, its a must buy, but dont expect anything as mindblowing as Primus's Antipop, or Oysterhead's Grand pecking order."
4,"I'm a jazzer, so what can I say?","Les Claypool is one of those individuals who does music for the sole purpose of doing music. It sounds to me like he digs to the core of music itself and tries to pull the creative, not to mention dark, musical forces that HAVE to be running through his head. These forces are transformed into something progressive, on its own level, that leave you with a band like Primus and a product like ""Purple Onion."" This CD is something that I'm certain not everyone will like, but I enjoyed it because it tickled the musical muses flowing through MY head and left me with a perspective on music that I had never before experienced. I hope that gives you a better encite into what Purple Onion is all about..."
2,Intriguing; disappointing.,"I am a long time fan of Primus and Les Claypool. I was intrigued by the Frog Brigate project, so I bought it on the credit of Les's credentials. This album is disappointing and lack luster, so I suggest you borrow it from a friend, say ""huh"", and save $15. If this were a movie, I would say wait to rent it, but don't pay full price."
3,Oh where has our little Les gone,"I give Les credit for continued origonality, and bending the structures of music. But I have been a fan since 1989 and long lost are the days of songs like ""John the Fisherman"" ""DMV"" and others that REALLY made you move your muffin. I am sure most can agree, that Les should go back to what made him what he is today.... the pure unadulterated energy. True we can get this in a live show... but I haven't seen him around since 1994."
4,the running stallion revisited,"This Breyer mold is known as the running stallion & was originally a horse. The horn & beard that morphed him into a unicorn has come & gone over the years as he has been first horse, then unicorn, then horse again, and now back to unicorn. This is one of the ""original"" Breyer molds, sculpted by Chris Hess who did all of the first Breyers. The color scheme on this guy is pretty, and the pearly look is a nice touch. The mold does produce individuals with standing problems."
5,Stardust Review,I got this unicorn as a present and have always played with it.My friends always want to play it.The only reason I rate it 4 stars for durability is because it can't stand very well because it's hoof got chipped.
5,Stardust,"Stardust is a beautiful horse he has stars on his hindquaters that looks like space, and those sweet look in his eyes not to mention gentle look and the beautiful horn on his head. I have the same model and he stands fine and the horn on my model is cemented on his head. My model is in tip top shape and feels brand new and i had him for two years."
5,Saxon Math 3,"Excellent math program for grade 3. Includes script so anyone can teach. If you do all that is asked, the program can take over one hour daily, but kids find it fun. Consumable worksheets will also need to be ordered."
1,Piece of Cheap Plastic Junk,This is simply a hollow piece of plastic that will not fasten to any 3 prong plug. I purchased it to secure to an auto battery tender AC cord when it wasn't in use. Not worth the time or cost of returning it.
1,Does not fit application,"This was listed as an accessory for a Kat's replacement heater cord that I ordered. Amazon had it on the same page, as ""buy these together."" It absolutely does not fit that application. It looks like this should cover the end of any 3-prong ac cord, but it doesn't fit anything that I have. The inside is hallow and has no way to attach to the prongs, so it would need to be an exact press-fit over the plug housing. Good luck with that. I would save your money or find something else."
1,Worst cap ever,when I received this cord cap I wanted to install on my block heater. This thing is probably the worst cap I have ever seen. Being an electrician for 34 years I know what I am talking about. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I would rate this a negative 10 if I could.What a rip off. Cap will not stay on any male cord cap I tried and I tried 10 different brands. If you need a cord cap keep looking.
1,"Wothless junk, does not fit","Bought this as it shows up as recommended to purchase with the Kat's (#28216) block heater cord as a the cap to it. It's an obvious need to someone who is buying the cord, and should actually come with the cord, but the cord is cheap and so is this, so no biggie buying them both. However, the cap Does not even remotely fit the end of the block heater cord. Plug end would have to be about a 1/4"" to 3/8"" smaller in diameter before it even came close to fitting inside of this cap. Not worth the time or trouble to ship it back, but I hope no one else wastes their money until they do something about this. Actually seems pretty ridiculous that these items sold together clearly aren't remotely close to working with each other, seems like something that should be pretty easy to get right considering the cord and this cap are made by the same company."
3,"works great, but...","does the job as advertised. It's a pain to install in cramped spaces. The circular joints pulled apart when I was trying to fit it all together. Had to ""repair"" with aluminum tape. I don't think I'd use it again."
1,Not a great product,"I did not get this for a dryer.I got this to be part of a ventilation system, and it was supposed to fit in a tight spot. This vent, however, is not skinny. It is quite thick and rounded, whereas I needed something skinny and square and tight.After purchasing, a week 'n a half went by with no action from the seller, so I put in a cancel-request and just went 'n bought the right one at my local hardware store. Then they sent it anyway, and I didn't want to hassle with a return, so it's sitting in my closet doing nothing. Thinking of using it in the future, but for now it sits."
3,Mono Only.,"3 stars for a great two album package from Jackie Wilson on Brunswick. This should have been a 5 star deal but many of the selections here were recorded in stereo and were originally released that way, but here they appear in mono. Another MONO disappointment."
5,A Great Recording at a Great Price,"There is not much that can be said about this recording. It is the quintessence of Carmen in every way shape and form. Beecham's directing gives astonishing life to one of the most beloved operas. Ms. de Los Angeles provides the perfect blend of sultriness and vocal control need for Carmen. A must have recording for any opera fan, 5 stars are not enough!"
2,MEH,"arhg. i don't know if it's because of previous abuse or overuse from another customer, but the pcx2500 that was provided my isp craps out on me ALL the time. about twice a week, i get HARDCORE packet loss and pings in the high 200's in online games and slow browsing. download speeds stay high, but continuous connection to online game servers SUCKS! i power cycle and RE power cycle often, but to no avail. when it works, it's mediocre, i get higher than average pings to most online game servers, and i'm supposed to be on a 3 mbit down 286kbit up line. i have a brother 1000 miles farther away that's getting half my ping.i do NOT recommend use, and DEFINITELY do not recommend purchase of one of these modems. i've confirmed this with my isp, they say my line speeds and signal strength are great, but my modem is reporting high ammounts of loss. pinging 100's to the first hop on a traceroute! ugh. i'm buying a motorola surfboard tomorow."
5,My 8 year old son's favorite book!,"My son loves to read this, so much so that he even recites many of the poems from memory. He and my six year old daughter howl with laughter again and again as they read these silly poems. I like that the poems include grown-up words and don't dumb the language down. We get vocabulary, recitation, rhythm, rhyme, and lots of clean, wholesome fun. It's inspiring to see the kids so caught up in a book instead of the junk on TV and electronic games!"
2,Just OK,"The book A Pizza the Size of the Sun by Jack Prelusty was just okay. I gave this book two stars. My favorite poem was ""I Was Walking in a Circle"" because it keeps going on and on. Some of the poems were boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone else because I do not like poetry."
3,Not what I thought,I thought this contained the FM modulator needed to play mp3 in car. It does not and only works with Sirius stuff.
1,Doesn't work,I bought this for a 2007 subaru and had a garage install it and it didn't work. not sure why?
2,CAUTION - May Cost You More!,"I have an 01 Chevy. The OEM radio has a smaller connector than on this product. When I called Circuit City (where I eventually purchased, and paid more $29) about this, they told me there was not any other model and that I'd have to pay $15...times 2...for converters. That's $50-60 total for this feature.So, I hooked up the antenna extender included in the box and guess what - it worked fine. No static. Even in Houston, I found a station (95.3) that worked just fine without this expensive feature.I haven't looked for a version that's made to work with my car without needing adapters, but it seems I don't need this device or CC's overpriced connectors. Make sure you check the return policy if buying. I will certainly be returning mine to the store. I don't need it or it's overpriced conversion connectors."
2,Transmitter does not work,"Like others have said, the FM transmitter does not work. After a long time on the phone with customer service, they admitted that with the new FCC rules the transmitter signal is too weak to give good sound on many radios. You have to get the system hardwired to get it to work correctly.Tip - call customer service and complain long and hard enough that it was false advertising and eventually they will agree to sending you the hardwire kit for free and also credit your account $30 dollars for the approx cost of getting it installed. They also have installation kit gift cards that they can give you."
5,Works like a dream,I have always had trouble getting my Sirius to broadcast a good FM signal. This thing fixed it. I tried the refurbished one first and it didn't work at all. I replaced it with this one and couldn't be happier. It works extremely well and can even override some local FM stations. I highly recommend this if you want to bump up your reception.
4,a good product,this is a good product if you are mecanical you must remove or pull out the radio and plug this in the removal of the radio can some times be difficult however once you do the install as the instructions state the radio is crystal clear
5,Easy and Awesome,"As a Sirius subscriber since '05-I love it. For a approx. $20 for the FM Adapter, it is like night and day, once installed. I did not have much static with my S-50, but my Stilletto 2, had too much. I have a 2002 Silverado and installed it without any tools, within 10mins. The dash face plate pops off, the squeeze of two tabs that hold my Alpine stereo, removes the stereo. With one hand holding the stereo, I was able to unplug the antenna connection between the Alpine and vehicle with the other. With the same hand I connected the FM Adapter between the Alpine and vehicle antenna. Pushed the Alpine back on track, rerouted the FM wire to the Stilletto, pushed the faceplate back on and it was finished. It works perfectly!"
4,Works well,"This item does what it says. I installed it between my Sirius Stiletto and my car stero. By having the ""direct wired"" connection (this item) it reduces virtually 99.99% of any FM static used when broadcasting via the FM remote to your car stero. I installed it myself - no problems. HIghly recommend to anyone using an ""unwired"" sirius product using the FM transmit mode."
3,Does not fit a 2000 Chevy Express,"This item is described to fit any manufactures antenna. My stock radio in my 2000 Chevy express van has a shorter, smaller diameter antenna plug. Both plugs on this adapter are to large to work. I was forced to buy two antenna adapters at a cost of $21.10. Which is more than I paid for the adapter. I encourage people to check there antenna plug before buying this item. If the outside of the plug is about 3/8"" it will work. If it is about 3/16"" it will be to small."
1,Does not fit vehicle,Does not work in 2010 Saab 9-3 even though it is listed to fit. Connection is different. My guess is that it does not work for many GM vehicles
1,DOES NOT FIT ALL VEHICLES LISTED!,I purchased 2 of these to put in two different Chevrolet trucks and it did not fit either one as stated it would. The antenna plug is different and will not work. Do a thorough check before ordering this product.
1,Not suitable for XM,"I purchased this item with the understanding that it would work for xm car docks, as well as sirius...Wrong...it does not."
2,Required more parts,Web site said it would work with my car. When I got the radio out the part would not hook up without additional parts and additional cost.
3,sirius,This turned out to be a waste of time and money for me. I could not get into my dash to hook this up and felt $100 was a bit excessive from the local big box store.I don't know how the unit works. I would suggest if you own a late model vehicle you check on installation prior to purchasing. This was my fault.
2,not the best,"I used to use the tape player and an adapter in my truck to listen to satellite radio, the tape player died and i didn't want to change the radio out ... so i bought this ... the sound quality is horrible ! the highs are so muted i had to turn the treble all the way up and he base almost all the way down ... ."
5,Sirius wired fm relay,It is truly the only way to interface your Sirius radio with your automobile radio. No interference. No wires hanging. Easy installation. Full transmission quality. Good price.
1,DOES NOT FIT 2005 DODGE NEON,"I bought this for my 2005 Dodge Neon and the little 'Make Sure It Fits' thing for this product stated it would work. It does not. The type of plug the antenna has into the default radio is entirely different than the type of plug this thing has. As for the performance of this Sirius radio adapter, I wouldn't know, since I couldn't complete installation. Just wanted to warn anyone else who might have the same type of vehicle."
4,"Good build quality, NOT made for iPod/mp3 player AUX hook up..","The product has good build quality and the installation is very simple. I bought this product without doing full research. My main intention was to use this as an AUX input for my factory stereo. Sad to say it doesn't work with any mp3 player or iPod or phone. The technology that's being used has to do with RF signals. If you are looking to hook up an mp3 player through the rear radio input, what you really need is a FM modulator. A FM modulator will convert the RF signal into a digital signal. I'm giving the product 4 stars for build quality and ease of installation. Though I feel the manufacture should inform the potential buyers that this product is not directly compatible with any mp3 players..."
1,size was deliberately mismarked,i ordered a large and got a small. a large sticked had been deliberately placed over the small size tag.
3,"Ok for a basic helmet, runs way too small","I just received the helmet today and it is so small that i will not be able to wear it at all. I ordered the size small, I have a Shoei helmet size small that i have a little room in and a Bell helmet size x-small that fits snugly so naturally I thought the small would fit fine. I even measured my head and went to the fuel website for sizing. Not only is it too small but the inner lining (which is quite thin) has a seam running straight up the center of the fore-head and another in the center at the back of the skull that digs in and leave a mark - what a stupid place to put a seam! Luckily it will fit my young son for occasional short trips. I would not recommend this helmet for extended use and definately buy at least one size up. In hindsight I would rather put a few more dollars into buying a better one."
3,Troublesome,"I've only just begun this book. I like the concept of comparing the U.S. social welfare scene with that in other countries. I'm having a lot of trouble getting through what's written, though. For example, in Chatper 1, I read one small paragraph four or five times, and I can't come up with a reasonable interpretation for what the author is trying to say. I asked someone else to try, and she failed too.If I understood the introductory material correctly, the first chapter of this book is unique among all chapters in that it presents theoretical and definitional background material. I'm hoping that the remaining chapters, with their proposed topical focus, will have a corresponding focus in their prose and presentation."
4,good all around look,While alot of books on Japanese culture alk about only one or two aspects this book gives an overview of many. If you only have time to read one book on the subject this is the one you should get. Remember that its super old (1976) and that Japanese society has changed in many ways. But this book still provides the fundamentals needed to understand the Japanese mind.
4,"so far, so good","I bought these for my 9 year old daughter, who has convinced herself she has insomnia. I have only used them once - the night before the first day of school - and they certainly seemed to work. I think she likes the idea of them; and I like that they are completely homeopathic."
3,Now this is a real joke!,"Now this is a real joke, no, no, no, no, no, no, noooooooo don't buy one just a rubber pad, I can't get no sound out of it at all, lol"
4,Zildjian mouse pad,"Hello,I actually love my Zildjian mouse pad. It seems to have a slick top surface, and it allows an easier roll of the mouse.It also fits in very well with the theme in my computer room. Music.Regards,Frank."
5,EUPHORIC MOVEMENT!!!,"This is a cd that will give you non-stop dance music at its best! That is, if you like alot of songs that are mostly instrumental, but catchy grooves! It, however, has a few songs that have alot of words. In fact, one beautiful song si the first cut. It is Karen Ramirez's ""Looking for Love."" She is a cross between the female singers of Anggun and Olive. Paul Van Dyk gets hsi recognition as a very impressive mix of ""for an Angel"" is mixed in too. This CD was well thought and planned because since most the songs and artists are not familiar to the U.S. audiences, it incorporates some HUGE DANCE HITS that are familiar in the states. These are of course: Nalin and Kane's ""Beachball"", Faithless's ""Insomnia"", Wink's ""Higher State of Consciousness"", and BT's ""Flaming June."" With these titles it shows you vast and wide array of sounds that this compilation holds. Enjoy... THSI IS THE CD THAT WILL GET ALL YOUR PARTIES STARTED AND GOING ALL NIGHT!!!"
2,Paleyfest-How I Met Your Mother,"I purchased this because my 2 daughters and I love the show and we thought we might get some secret info for the up coming seasons. The DVD is unwatchable. It jumps, skips, and freezes at least for the first 20 minutes. We just stopped it after the first 20 minutes."
3,a quick 1st review...,well since i saw stooges on amc an the nyuk crew i was impressed also trying to specialize there particulars an arange an coordinate consolation type coriculums of there 3perswasionds ...
1,Excellent choice,"This camera is all that they say it is and more. The value for the price is excellent. For the novice or the more advanced user, the unit will satisfy both. The directions are well written. Within minutes after it's arrival, I had already taken a sepia print, a regular print, and a short movie."
5,Canon PowerShot,Really impressed with the quality of pictures. Small and lightweight. Good for people with nimble fingers.
4,"Okay, so so","I have the camera for a few days and my experience is sos so okay. It is not spectacular nor great but bad either.The camera has a good interface on screen and the flash does its job once you have figured out working around some standard settings.The view finder is useless as it is the size of a pin head. Canon could have got rid of that feature. Thankfully the display works well, also outside in the sun.Picture quality is as you would expect of Canon.I wonder when Canon improves on the battery indication level as now it only shows up when it is almost time to recharge/replace the battery. When you are out on a trip that can be a bit of a problem. The alternative is to charge it every time you are coming home afte rusing the camera but that again is not good for the lifespan of the battery.I am keeping the camera as a second one next to my bigger and much better Panasonic8 that I do not want to drag around every night and day whilst this one fits in your pocket."
4,Panasonic comparison,First things I noticed about this canon is the noise (when tele zooming) is louder than panasonic (I previously owned the Panasonic Lumnix FX-01 and the FZ1). Also digital zoom is at snails pace. A real disappointment is the lack of Auto Exposure Bracket. I believe almost if not all panasonic compacts have this. Canon only put this feature on its more professional higher end cameras.Indoor images are better than the panasonic.Yes...they could of made a better power button. Overall so far it's a good camera.
4,Camera,We are happy with the camera. Gave it 4 stars because we haven't had the camera that long to play with.
5,Great Compact Camera!,"If you are looking for a compact camera that can travel with you, this is it! Takes great photos and great for taking photos of kids and pets. The Image stabilizer is a must have, it really takes the shake out of pictures."
3,PowerShot Review,Poor pictures when you have to use flash. Instruction booklet is confusing and hard to follow. I would probably not purchase this camera again.
1,Poorly Constructed,"This is my second and last Powershot, they are good because they takes decent shots and are small, but the problem is that they are not built to last. I accidentally dropped one from waist high and that killed it, the other one just blew out on me after only 2 years. They need to improve their construction of these things to make them more durable"
4,good camera fits in your pocket,Has been a good point and shoot camera. esp outside. Indoors in poor light conditions not as good. For the price and for the punishment it takes when I travel or just going to the park (yes I have dropped it a couple of times). It has worked great and it fits easily into my pocket.
4,Great performance!,Very small and easily be taken anywhere.8.0 MP is large enough for common use.But it is some what insensitive with the automatic image rotation and it seems SD850 does not include a quick movement mode.Totally it is a great digital camera for people who do not require professional photographs.
3,"Great photos, good movies - flimsy A/V out digital cover","Photos are excellent quality. Movies are very good except when the zoom is used the result is grainy. Software is very good and easy to use. The only complaint as others have mentioned is that the cover for the A/V OUT digital (you have to open it to plug the other end of the USB cord into the camera to download to a computer) is extremely flimsy. It is plastic and doesn't snap in without several attempts after used a couple of times. The rest of the camera is solid and well made. We plan to use underwater on vacation soon and will add another post to share our experience.If you plan to purchase this camera, test the A/V OUT cover first. Other than that it is a great camera for the money."
5,Excellent camera,"I did quite extensive research and decided to buy the Canon SD850 before a recent trip. It's an excellent camera within the price range of my budget and the feature I need. The two features I like the most are the macro and photo stitch. The macro feature is great for taking static picture of flowers, wild life etc. The photo stitch function is good for taking panoramic view.Along with the camera, I bought a 4GB SD card which can hold over one thousand pictures. The other nice feature is the software give you the option of downloading all photos or newly taken pictures."
1,"BUY THE SD870, MUCH BETTER THAN THE SD850","With the SD870 you get a fantastic Wide Angle Lens 28mm, Battery Meter so you will know when your battery is low (Not like the SD850 that has no battery warning indicator at all), 3"" LCD Viewfinder that will blow your mind, lighter camera body, and choice of 2 colors (Silver or Two-Tone Black/Silver. I've already seen 5 people return their SD850 and get the SD870 instead. So glad I didn't make that mistake in the first place. After doing research for 2 months, the SD870 is the best Digital Elph camera Canon has ever produced. The SD800 was the best and this replaces that."
1,"""Lens Error""","After only 2 years of ownership, maybe 2000 pictures, and already one repair of the dreaded ""lens error"", the camera yet again stopped working. None of the suggested remedies helped. This is it - I am no longer buying Canon cameras of the SD/Elph series."
5,Good Product,"I bought this camera as a gift for my brother and he loved it. The features, especially the Image stabilizer feature is good. A good buy overall."
4,Good Point and Shoot,"I have a Canon G6 which I love. However, I wanted something I could carry in my pocket so after some research I picked the Canon SD850 IS. I took it on a cruise with me so I could always have it with me. I took a lot of pictures with it and can say that outside in daylight it takes great pictures. Maybe even better than my G6. However, inside and in situations where you need a flash it leaves a bit to be desired. First the flash is on the upper left hand corner of the camera so it is easy to block the flash with your finger when taking pictures. Also as this is a smaller camera the flash is limited so don't expect any great pictures at any distance. The flash is just not strong enough to cover much area. Bottom line: I am satisfied with the camera. It serves the purpose that I bought it for. It a great point and shoot pocket camera with some good features on it. If I am going on a photo project I take both cameras in the event I need a good flash."
4,Nice little point-and-shooter,"I love the video mode, captures clear and smooth video to be displayed on YouTube. Not trying to compare to videocam here, but its video capability is just enough for web broadcast. The auto mode is suitable for just about everything. Occasionally, needs to switch to manual mode to capture low light close up shoots. The scene/indoor mode is great for taking pictures at home. The ""kids/pets"" mode not very useful. Keep an eye on the flash when using scene mode, the auto setting might be too much light. The zoom is just 4x, enough for daily use but not great if far away from object. The battery life is excellent, been taking way too many pictures or videos and never run dry.The print outs are great, I have an Canon IP5000, everything is ver detailed and correct balance of color, and face is not too warm.If you just want something easy to use and don't have time to adjust exposure ....etc, this is a great camera."
1,Great camera while it lasted,"Bought this camera around 2 years ago for my wife for christmas, it takes very good photos. Unfortunataly the camera only lasted about 2 years before falling apart. On a trip to california the camera decided to give me a ""lens error"" and would no longer retract the lens. After looking closely at the camera body i noticed there were multiple screws missing as well. I did not consider this the top of the line but $250 bones is quite a bit too spend on a point and shoot. I purchased the camera after much online research and reading great reviews on about every site i visited, none of them mentioned I would be throwing it in the trash a few years later. At least with my old sony i sold it on ebay when i upgraded, fat chance with this one. To bad i can't really review the powershot line as a whole that way people would at least know about the problem."
5,Very good camera,"For a point and shoot camera, this little gem packs a lot of advanced features.1) Red-eye correction. No more red-eyes! It automatically fixes them.2) Image stabilization. Will correct your hand movements but will not stop..."
4,Canon Powershot SD850,"Excellent color, resolution and image stabilization. I was able to take photos hand held at a shutter speed of 1/4 sec. Relatively low noise at up to ISO 200. ISO 400 noise level and detail are good enough for snapshots. Because the camera is so small, controls are close together so care must be taken to not change settings inadvertently. In very bright daylight, the screen is usable for composing but you cannot see detail in it. In that case you can use the optical viewfinder. I would give it a 5 star rating if I could use ISO 800 at the same noise level at ISO 200."
5,video is great!,"We wanted a point and shoot which would capture decent videos as well. The videos are great (in addition to all of the other great features described in every other review). If you are planning to use the video a lot, minimally get the 4GB card, if not a bigger one if you can. They use a lot of space but it is really worth it!!"
4,"Great Camera, but...","If you are looking for a camera with great features, look no further.The price is actually reasonable for what you get. With the simpleclick of a button, you have a beautiful detailed photo that capturesthe moment and will last forever. The only reason I rated this with4 stars was because of the size. It always aggravated me that I couldn'tput it in my pocket because it was too thick. Otherwise, I love thiscamera, and if size isn't an issue for you, this camera is a fantasticpurchase!"
4,Review of canon sd 850 is,This is a very good product. Wish there were special scene modes like sunset/twilight like nikon has.
2,Powershot SD850 IS 8.0MP--no IS,I bought this camera recently and observed in it that IS(Image Stabilizer) is not working really upset especially bought this for IS but is not as it is advertising.Please think before buy this camera because IS is not functioning.---shan
1,poor picture quality,"Purchased this camera as a gift for my mother. After reading and re-reading the manual (and not just the quick start manual - the full version) We were both very confident that we had a good grasp of the camera and the functions. We set it to super fine quality and the pictures are just not very crisp. In fact, they are hazy and in very soft focus - as if we had it set to the lowest resolution. Am very unhappy with this purchase. Perhaps this one is defective, though looking at the most recent consumer reports review of it they only give it a ""good"" for picture quality. Beware."
2,Great pics but red eye in EVERY indoor pic!!,"I have returned about 8 cameras in the search for the perfect one.The Kodak Z712 took perfect pix but it was bulky. I thought the SONYSD 850 was the answer and it was until I realized nearly everysingle inddor pic in even slightly low light has red eye!The red eye correction in the camera is great when it works. Muchof the time it does not.I don't think it's possible to a compact camera that takes greatpics in low light. In short, if picture quality is THE mostimportant fact for you, keep looking. As for me, I'm goingback to the Kodak Z712, great pix and 12x zoom. What more canI ask for."
3,Nice camera,I was looking for a good ultra compact camera for an upcoming trip to Italy. This camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures.
4,Good Digital Camera for a Beginner,This is my first digital camera. I have enjoyed using it to capture life here in the NW. I wish it had more options for zooming in but think you have to go to something larger & a new price range to get that.Does what it needs to do & easy to start taking pictures with for a real beginner like me.
4,Great camera,"Took this guy to Costa Rica for a week and took some amazing photos and videos. Fabulous camera! A little pricey, but worth it (esp for optical image stabilization)."
5,No Brainer,Love the camera more than I thought I would. I took it out of the box and immediately took it on vacation without ever reading a manual. It worked perfectly and was that easy to use. I bought a 2 gig card and was able to capture movie after movie and zoom while taking a movie which is a great feature. Great value for the money.
4,Canon Powershot SD 850 IS,"A nice, compact, and easy to use camera. The image stabilization and the 4x optical zoom are excellent features. The only negative is the flash refresh rate, which, is not as fast as I would have liked."
4,"OK quality, but a bit bulky and heavy","Previously had an SD750 which was an excelent camera, but got stolen. Purchased SD850 as a replacement. SD850 picture quality is good, has some extra options, but is fairly bulky and much heavier than the 750."
5,IMPRESSED!!!,I received this camera for my birthday and cannot believe how easy it is for me to take such great pictures. I own the Canon Rebel 2000 35mm and I could never get the pictures to come out this way...it's hard to get a bad shot with this camera!!! I never wanted to get into this whole point and shoot thing and was quite reluctant but boy was I WRONG! 1000% Satisfied and I will never go back. The quality of the images can't be beat. They look like professional shots and have since looked into photography for the first time because it has inspired me to continue taking such great pics. I will post the pics up soon...you won't believe your eyes! Under 300 bucks = Priceless Shots
4,great compact camera,"This camera may be small, but it feels very solid when you hold it. You can feel the quality and not worry that you may break it. Pictures have turned out very clear. The only possible downfall is the multitude of options, formats, menus, etc. It's possible that I may learn how to use all of these options after I have had the camera for a while, but for now I often find myself accidentally hitting a button and ending up in a menu that I don't know anything about."
5,Much better than my old Canon Powershot,"You can read all the other reviews about what this has and what works. However, the 2 things that really impressed me are the video and the digital macro. The video is way better than I expected and with sound too. My friends were so impressed, they went out and bought a camera just like this. Also, the digital macro actually works! You can get within a couple inches and it takes wonderful photos. Downside is it turns off the flash, but I can see why if you are within inches of an object. All-in-all I still like it after 8 months and would recommend it."
4,Great camera with one flaw.,"The colors are fabulous, and the image stabilizer is wonderful. I can't speak for semi-pro photographers, but for someone like me that loves to take photos for pleasure, this is a good camera. The only complaint I have is that, as others have mentioned, this camera does not have a ""wide angle"" lens. I didn't really understand this until I started shooting. I have to back up quite a way to get a good shot of a large object (like a building front or a room). Compared to my Pentax Optio, the width of the shot seems very limited. I hope I'll get used to this with time.On the other hand, I was shocked to discover how cheap accessories are now compared with what I paid two years ago. A 2 gb memory card and a spare battery for under $20? FANTASTIC.Overall, I think that I got a good deal on a really good camera."
4,from disposable to digital in one click,"I have taken pics with disposable cameras for twenty years. I could never get the hang of a ""real"" camera, and it was less stressful to snap quick shots of things and blame the lack of quality on the camera. I purchased the Canon Powershot SD850 IS 8.0 MP Digital Elph Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom because I finally have something worth taking pics of-children and grandchildren! After months of research, I bought the Canon. OMG! Great pictures, easy to get on the comp and print, never a blur or smear, fits in my purse, and I understand enough to function well. There are a lot of options and abilities this camera has that I have not used, but maybe I will get the bug. For now, point and click is awesome!!! The only downside is that the symbols used are not too clearly associated with the funtion they identify. This is a learning curve thing. This camera is my friend. Easy to use now, fun to explore and learn about later."
1,just don't drop it.,"you know, after all the glowing 5 star reviews, you never really glance at the one stars.turns out, a couple of us have the same problem...i've had this camera for about 2 weeks... unlike my previous camera (a casio exilim 750z), this camera leaves the lens telescoped out even if you're just glancing through old photos...which is what were doing when we dropped it today. and the lens got stuck.and the camera frozen.i'm sure this camera is more vulnerable since there are 3 pieces that telescope out.after reading the other one stars, it looks like i'm in for warranty hell.sure i dropped it, but does this camera have to be SO easily broken? can someone admit a design flaw? and i'm fairly sure that any camera will be dropped at some point in it's life. don't expect this one to survive it.(yes i dropped the casio a few times, enough to crack the battery door. but it stayed together with some tape... and still works. so much for ""upgrading""...)"
3,"Great snapshots, but on/off button broke in less than 2 years","Very convenient small size, and great color (in vivid mode), and great sharpness (in default lens setting). Telephoto images (even in just the optical range) are disappointing due to degraded sharpness (even in bright light conditions).For a camera of this cost (nearly $300 in late 2007) some design aspects are disappointing. Specifically, the tiny recessed plastic on/off button broke a few months after the 1 year warranty expired. It doesn't make a difference how good a camera is if you cannot turn it on. I assume this is a design issue common to the SD Elph series."
4,Very good camera,I have been using this camera since July and have taken many great pictures. To get full use of the capabilities reading the manual is extremely helpful. The biggest problem I seem to have is eliminating red eye when taking indoor pictures. Other than that I am very satisfied. The size is perfect.
5,Great Camera,It's a great Camera and meets all your expectations...I bought it from amazon along with Kingston 2GB memory card and case logic camera case for $260/- and that's a steal....The pictures are great and the operations simple..I would highly recommend it and the pricing on Amazon is simply great...
4,Still working,"I still use this Camera, I got it back in 2007. The quality isn't amazing, especially with DSLRs becoming cheaper, but for a point and shoot, this thing is still great."
2,wobs,"Not happy at all with this camera.it suffers from condensation collection which causes internal water damage. customer service will not fix or replace it.They actually told me that I should carry it around in a plastic bagevery time I went from air conditioning to outside.Since they couldn't fix it, they offered me a refurbished unit for more$$$ then I can find it here."
1,Lens error!,"I've used this camera for around 18 months, and the lens jammed on Easter. Contacted Cannon, and they said that oarticular failure mode typical only occurs if the consumer bumps or drops the camera. It has never been dropped, and has been babied....lesson learned...buy Sony."
4,item returned,"i returned this item as i realized it was a refurbished camera. i have purchased cameras before and there is always a plastic cover that sticks to the screen. i cleary can see it was used and refurbished. i returned it and amazon charged me like a $10 fee. this might be the last time i buy from amazon. in the past they would sell products as new now they would sell refurbised items as new. thats not fair to the consumer, so i would be more careful. unless the product is marked at deep discount and marked as refurbished i think amazon should be more honest with new and refurbished items."
3,Love and Hate,Had this camera for a couple of weeks...and was really liking it. I took it on a backpacking trip where the lens decided to stop working. Canon took it back and is working on it now. Lets see if they try to charge me even if its under warranty.
3,Canon Powershot SD850,"This camera is a gem. The stills are wonderful, but the real thrill lies in the video. It is so clear that it seems as if one is viewing an actual movie. The only disappointment is that there is no zoom while in video mode. I appreciate the optical view finder as well as a large lcd screen. The small camera body is good for slipping into one's pocket or purse, but it is a bit slippery and takes some getting used to to hold on to it."
2,"Takes great pictures ... but beware the ""Lens Error""!!!","This is a very nice little camera with a lot of easy to use features, and takes very, very nice pictures for the size and price.But buyer beware ... within just two weeks of buying this camera, it unexpectedly stopped working ... the lens cover would not open and the display simply said ""Lens Error Restart Camera"". Nothing would solve this problem, and the camera was completely non functional. This happened after only two weeks of use, and I did not mistreat the camera in any way in those two weeks.Kudos to Amazon on their excellent customer service. They replaced the camera with no questions asked and made it very easy to return the defective one.However, I am nervous and wondering just when the replacement is going to have the same issue. Google this camera and you'll find several other consumers have had the same issue, and Canon has been very reluctant to solve it."
3,"Great camera, but not for nights","This is my first camera (my own). I have handled a lot my friends cam. The SD850 is really great for out door shoots in day light. Canon still has to work on the flash technology for low light shoots. Not very satisfied with pictures taken using flash in low light or night. But otherwise the picture quality is far excellent compared to others. Manually disabling the flash, apparently disables the Image-stabilization also...so pictures are shaky sometimes."
4,Very good camera,"Very good product, easy to operate, sharp pictures. The only ""cons"" is that the lid on battery compartiment sometimes opens when you try to handle the camera with only one hand."
5,great point and shoot camera,"This little camera is as advertised. The pictures taken by an amateur are sharp, focused and well balanced for light and color. The large screen helps with composition and the range finder window is a comfort to us old timers.A recent trip to Italy produced 250 pictures on one battery charge and all were just fine on the ""auto""setting. Cathederal interiors required some adjustments which are easily made.Buy the padded case at Target for $4.00."
5,Great point and shoot,"I like Canons small cameras although a bit pricey compared to other cameras in this category. I have always had great pics from these small canon cameras and have a couple of them. This camera has a nice solid feel, easy controls and a large numbr of scene settings and modes to give you a very wide spectrum for shooting.However, I prefer my Nikon D80 and D300 which are in a different level of course and not pocket carrying types either. The Canon above is some I have in pocket all the time for quick speedy snapshots."
2,Great Pictures But Beware,"I've had this camera for 2 1/2 months. I've only used it a few times. Great pictures! I now have a lens era, restart camera issue. The lens will not retract. I have never dropped it, bumped it, or gotten it wet. Upon researching this camera, I found out that others have experienced the same problem. No help from Canon. They will only repair. So Beware!"
5,Tickled,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She had resisted for years using our only other camera, another Canon. This one is so light weight and simple to use, and the instructions are so clear, that she has taken it everywhere she goes. At this price I'd be hard pressed to have expected all these features."
5,"Good quality, above average price, but worth it.","Simple to start shooting as soon as battery is charged. Image stabilization works quite well and decent low light photos, flash underpowered, but also doesn't wash out images. Very compact and feature rich with Quicktime support. Perfect for when the SLR is just too damn big. Paid ~$300. Five stars for quality that overcame price."
4,Canon SD850 IS,"The Canon SD850 IS is a superb point and shoot camera that I would recommend to anyone interested in a small point and shoot. It has an optical viewfinder which is the only way to take pictures on a bright sunny day, particularly with the sun behind you, or when you have poor light and need to hold the camera steady (not easy to do at arms length).Pros:-small size and compact-one of the few with an optical viewfinder-image stabilization and face detection (not sure how useful face detection is)-4X optical zoom is 33% more than the normal 3X-8MP is enough for any photos under 14x17 or so-large 2.5"" LCDCons:-no manual controls of shutter speed or aperature-battery life seems a bit shorter than others-weak flash, but not much different than any small point and shoot"
5,Canon doesn't disappoint,"I ordered the Canon PowerShot SD850 IS 8.0 Digital Elph exactly a month ago. It shipped from Adorama Camera in NYC and arrived one week after the order was placed, which I thought was excellent service. I chose Canon based on a friend's general recommendation of the brand, and I selected this model based on customer reviews of this model posted on Amazon. This is my first experience using a digital camera, and I was happy to discover that the SD850 is quite easy to use, even though it has many features. I've been very satisfied with both the performance and image quality. Everything about the camera has been satisfactory."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading many of the reviews and researching every P & S in the compact digital camera class for over 2 months, I decided to go with the SD850. I bought it to replace my PowerShot A400, which takes great pics but is really slow. I couldn't wait to try out my new cam and did so after a full battery charge. Well, I'm sorry to report that this camera, for the amount I paid, does not live up to its reputation. Low light pics are the noisiest I've ever seen and being I will be taking most of my pics at gigs and concerts, this camera will not do it for me. I tried every setting including all manual settings but who wants to fiddle around with manual controls if you're trying to capture a candid shot? If you are considering this cam for purchase, please note that it is a very poor low light performer and if you will be shooting in low light, you should probably keep on looking. I gave it 2 stars because I like the LCD display. Happy Holidays!"
4,Awesome little camera for the causal photographer,"I had previoulsy had a Canon Powershot G2 which is harder to use and much beefier than this one. I am a casual photographer and needed somthing small and easy to use. The SD850 has many of the same features as the G2 and takes great photos. It also fits in my pocket which was drawback on the G2. I would be tempted to give it a 5 star rating but I am a tough grader. The only improvement could be to have a battery meter as this camera only warns when the battery is getting low.Also, the Amazon price seemed very reasonable."
5,excellent camera!,"I own a Canon PowerShot S3 in addition to this camera. I bought the PowerShot SD850 camera for its size - it is much more portable. It's size is great to slip in a pocket of jeans. Even though it is much smaller than the S3, I believe it focuses much better and has clearer pictures. I am very impressed with the performance of the PowerShot SD850!"
5,Nice camera,"This is a solid camera, just holding it you can tell that it's not flimsy. I even dropped it once right on the extended lens and it still works fine. The optical zoom is great, image stabilizer is nice too. All around great camera."
4,Very Good Camera,"It's a very good photo camera. Films a great too, considering it is a small camera.The only thing to complain is that some people may find it a little tricky to operate."
5,Best digital camera so far,This is the best digicam i have ever used.It takes great pictures on the beach.The colors are excellent so is the image stabilisation mode.
5,Canon SD850,"The Canon SD850 is an excellent point-and-click style digital camera. It is small and lightweight, easy to use, and takes outstanding photos. The picture quality exceeded my expectations - even an amateur can take professional looking photos with this camera. For the price, it offers outstanding value and I would not hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone that is in the market for one."
1,Tremendous disappointment,"We've always purchased Canon cameras here at home on the strength of their lenses, easy user interface, and generally good reputation. But in light of my experience with the 850 IS, I'll be reluctant to do so again. My camera worked reasonably well for the first three years of ownership, although I never found the IS feature to work as consistently or as well as promoted in Canon's marketing of the product. But in the past year, my camera has developed the focusing problem others have reported. Whether or not I use the optical zoom, the camera fails to focus in auto or manual mode. As I take most of my shots indoors, this has rendered the shots useless. Meanwhile, my cell phone camera (an iPhone 4) manages to focus and take decent shots in similar settings with no trouble. A camera this expensive and this touted for its features should not last such a short time. Avoid."
4,Amazing portable camera,"I've had this camera for over two years, and it still is amazing. The size is perfect, love the features, and i've gotten some great quality pics. The video setting is on of my favorites. The highest quality video is very nice. I now have a canon rebel t1i, but I still depend on this camera for the quick shots or the times I can't take my rebel. Great quality camera! So much fun! XD"
4,A new view to the world.,"The Person I bought this camera for was looking for something to re-invigorate their enjoyment of hiking in San Francisco. It does all that and more. The screen is big and the controls are easy to read. The presets are very helpful. I think it could use a few more, like a sport mode and maybe a black and white screen mode. It might help if had a mini mirror on the front for self portraits."
2,no battery power indicator,"How hard is it to let us know what's going on with the battery power? It's not a very good answer to keep a spare around when these things easily last weeks with moderate usage. Sony's cameras show it down to the minute what's left. I really miss that.Also, the zoom button is completely in a silly place. It's next to impossible to use it the way it's designed. Should have been on the inside. It's also not easy to use for flipping through photos and zooming in and out.And you can't force the flash on only off in the automatic setting? Come on guys.Same quality pics on Sony so it's back to Sony for me next time."
1,"Less than 2yrs old, the lens stuck. Est repair cost: $130","I bought this camera in July of 2008 for $230. After less than two years of moderate use, the lens got stuck. The estimated cost for repair is $130, which is the cost of a new camera. I would be fine if the camera either didn't break, or if repairs cost $30 to $50. My next camera will be a Canon, but a cheaper one, and I'll basically be treating it as an 18mo disposable camera."
4,Good nice camera,"This is a good camera I found and am happy with this one. The only thing with this camera is that, i am not able to get into modes to set for the required shoots or pictures. For eg: i could not find, night mode and in the scroll wheel to chage the modes, i see only 5: auto, manual,portrait, video and play.Rest about this camera is good.......nice and handy."
4,Imagination Desk not bad,"My parents bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. I had to return the first one, it didn't respond when you pressed anything on the desk top. Though she enjoys coloring, and does so, she also likes to take the purple top off and the crayon container top off all the time. Overall she seems to enjoy this toy, and what's nice is you can go directly to the leapfrog webpage and print out more coloring pages : )"
3,A good idea but NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"The crayon cover falls off every time you open it. The purple thing that holds the paper down falls apart every time you change paper. Every letter that the thing says sounds the same. My daughter laughs because she thinks that is says ""UGH"" every time... like A says UGH, C says UGH etc...... While this was a nice idea it is not living up to expections."
4,Very nice toy,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas and she is 2 and a half. She REALLY likes it. Contrary to other reviews, ours does sense when she is coloring though my daughter tends to push pretty hard. She loves the music and the characters! Though I don't like how easy it is for her to reset it. Being that she's so young I have to change the pages out and continue to correct it once it's been reset by her. She plays with it everyday. We bought another cartridge and set of coloring pages with Pooh on it. She loved that too! Sometimes the paper comes loose from the purple holder and that's a pain too. I hope that purple holder will hold up with all the use it gets from my daughter. We still would recommend this toy and would buy it again!"
5,Wonderful for the artistic/musical child,I got this toy for my 5 year old son for a Christmas present last year. He wanted to just sit and color and didn't want to stop to open the rest of his presents. He loves to color and also loves music so this toy was just right for him. He sings along as he colors. Leaps repetition gets to me after a while but my son doesn't seem to mind. His teacher said repetition is important at that age and helps them learn. He can change the pages himself but the little door where the crayons go does come off and we are always putting that back in place. We have a mindstation and print new pages for him all the time. After a year it is still working great.
2,Unresponsive and Inaudible Toy,"My biggest complaint with the talking Leap Frog toys is that the words are often difficult to distinguish. I have the same complaint with this toy. However, my biggest complaint is the fact that you must bear down very hard when coloring in order for the toy to respond and identify what you are coloring. Our daughter colors very well but with a lighter stroke. The instructions indicate that a ""medium pressure"" on the surfact is required; however, I tried coloring with what I considered heavy pressure for an adult, and the toy frequently failed to respond. I am not all impressed or satisfied with this product. Unless you have a child with a heavy hand, I would recommend against purcahsing this product."
2,Not a really great toy.,"This is a really good idea, but frankly, it falls apart alot. The purple piece that holds the coloring page indoesn't stay in very well. Also, it seems that the kidsreally have to press hard in order for the device to knowwhere they are. My son got this for Christmas and hardlyever plays with it, when he does, it turns itself off a lotbecause it can't sense that he is coloring. Anyway, it is abig disappointment."
3,Good Concept...Needs Improvement,"I purchased the Imagination Desk as a Christmas gift for our 3 year old son last year. There was much advertising on this product last Christmas season, but little on 'true' parent reviews. Every child is different, but it did not hold our son's attention at all. He was mainly interested in coloring on it, but that was even short lived.It is fairly sturdy, but the frames pop off very easily. The built in storage slot needs a cover to keep the contents from sliding out."
4,"Educational, not durable","I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter last Christmas. It is very educational and she plays with it very often. The only real problem I have is the cover falls off EVERY time she lifts it to put in a new coloring sheet. She cannot put it back on by herself, so I have to constantly put it back on for her. This is especially frustrating when she is playing with it in the back seat of the car. For the price, I expected something a lot more durable. Other than that, we love it."
2,Think before you buy this....,"My 3 year old daughter has had this toy for a total of 5 days and we are already having problems. The batteries already need replaced, the cover to the crayon compartment will not stay on and the top purple plastic cover for the coloring pages keeps coming off the hinges and she cannot get it back on without help. Also, she was colring the letter ""c"" and the pad was telling her about the letter ""u"". Last but not least the storage in the back is not too great because one false move and everything falls out. Great concept but this toy is going back to the store tomorrow."
2,"Nice toy initially, but not a keeper","My daughter received this last year for x mas. I didn't realize the coloring books cost ... She finished the first book in two days and then I had to go out to buy a new coloring book. By the time I came home with the Winnie the Pooh coloring book (which is very cute, but not at all worth [the money]), my daughter was already finished with the excitement of the whole thing. Also, the frame broke after about a month. It still works, but I don't think it should have broken.The train plate is cute, but only tells the numbers and says a few things. That wasn't ever used again either.One more thing...The toy is extremely large and difficult to store. I really do prefer a nice regular coloring book, and a box of crayons, and so does my daughter."
3,Disappointed mom,When we bought this for our 4 year old we felt that this would be a great way to help her become more interested in her letters and numbers. She has fun with the games but becomes bored easily. She would rather use her sisters Leap pad. I would say that if she were younger this would hold her attention much more. To other parents of this age group on an educational level I would recommend going straight to the leap pad. Plus the books are much more available.
1,Not completely satisfied,"We bought this for our two and a half year old for Christmas. He is was just beginning to learn his letters and numbers. I love the number train attachment, as does he. He responds to the questions and is beginning to learn the numbers with this. I do not like the coloring pages. I would prefer to buy a coloring book with these pages for three or four dollars instead. The sounds are too easily reset and Leap keeps changing the subject as my son colors. Also, my son may color in the wrong spot and Leap will be singing the A song while my son is coloring the B page. I wish I could have bought the number attachment separately."
3,Strongly Consider before buying,"I purchased this toy for my 4 year old son who, at first, loved it. But it is quite sensitive. If he colored to hard it constantly repeated itself. If the paper wasn't in just right and the ""go"" button was pressed you would here a totally different letter than what you were working on. Screen is constantly falling off and so is the cover to the crayons. My son gets so frustrated with it that most of the time he colors with the sound off. The train activity plate is nice. Could do a few more things. Very disappointed with it. Should work alot better for the price paid. Has good education possibilities if it worked properly."
3,Ok for someone not yet familiar with numbers/letters,"I have a hard time finding toys to grab my daughter's interest. She knew her numbers and alphabet by age 2 so I thought this toy would be neat, just reinforcement, etc. fun to color, etc. She is over 3 and NEVER plays with it. Maybe the first few weeks she did but I don't think it was challenging enough and it is difficult to understand. She seems to use a LEAPPAD more..but even that is iffy... She is basically an imagination type person and perhaps this toy didn't lend to that way of thinking..I don't know..I was really surprised she didn't go for it more than she did but again, she knew her numbers, letters, etc. already so perhaps it was a little boring?? I don't know..."
3,More money than its worth,"I bought this for my 4 year old and the first time she colored with it I thought it was broken because as she colored it was not interacting, come to find out you really have to press hard with the crayon for the toy to do so. I then decided to download more coloring pages for her as the booklet that comes with this toy tells you, and I found out that you have to PURCHASE a memberhip along with a Mind Station or a Leaplink Connector,just to get pages to color. The cost of the coloring pages and gear, cost more than the toy itself!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Seemed like a good idea at the time, perfect for the kids, for the summer. It didn't even come close to lasting through the summer. I got, maybe, ten swim sessions out of it before it got a hole in the bottom of the liner. I drained it, patched it(with included patches), and filled it back up, only to waste multiple gallons of water and money. The patch didn't hold and all of the water came pouring back out. So, I patched it again with a heavier duty patch and glue...filled it back up...woke up next morning to completely being drained again. This has been my most frustrating purchase through amazon and the BIGGEST waste of money...very disappointed!!! So, it still being summer(August), I will go roll it up and kick it to the curb, seeing as how my return window was only 30 days. Save your money and get the aluminum above ground pool...my mother raised four kids(and their friends) in one and it lasted years."
2,Nice while it lasted,We bought this pool with the salt water pump and enjoyed it for one season. Upon set up the second year we found a couple of small leaks which we patched with the repair kit. However a couple of days after set up one leak grew until the entire side was ripped -- I was watching as it happened -- flooded our backyard and our neighbor's driveway within a matter of minutes. I had figured two seasons of this pool would be cheaper than a pool membership. Guess we lost out. We'll hold it's funeral after we clean up the MESS!
3,Non-Standard Everything,"Setup was easy and first few weeks were fun. However, the pump and filter are way too small for this pool. We bought a bigger and better pump and then spent a couple of days working to hook up the new pump. Nothing about this pool is standard. The fittings on the pool are non-standard sizes. The screen and pole are non-standard sizes.Bottom line: if you like a challenge, this pool is for you."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,I set up this pool barely a week ago. I thought it was great for a while. Then one morning i went outside and one side had blown out and knocked through my fence. terrible quality.
5,Big Pool!!!,"Nice pool!! I'd buy more. It's pretty big to tell you that. I love to have this pool in my school. It's very nice even though I don't have it. I just used it in my cousins house. Buy it!!! Recommendation: Over 4 ft, Fine. Under 3 ft, with a float or life jacket. Electric Bird Out!!!!"
3,Fun but a Huge Hassle,"I bought this pools two summers ago for my kids ages 14 and 7. It was a big pain to set up,take down and store. We could not keep the cover from blowing off, so it got very dirty very quickly. I had to clean it every couple of days. We finally got rid of it, and now plan to get an Easy Set pool. Most of our neighbors have Easy Set pools amd they tell me they are easy to keep up because they can be easily taken down if they need to be. Hopefully I have better luck with an Easy Set."
5,Intex 12x30 pool,"I learned the hard way. Purchased many pools and this is the best design and size. Not too big for the wife and I but large enough for two rafts to float around on. Bigger pools cost more for water and expensive chemicals. 30"" is deep enough to get wet and use rafts. Stay away from the cheap air filled easy sets. They don't last. Had birds land on the air filled ring and puncture the ring constantly. What a pain. These pools are good for many seasons. Use sand under then a good tarp over the sand and under the pool. This is the best pool of the four I have owned."
2,Metal Frame,"I had my Intex Pool for 1 season.All of the metal T's rusted out.We live in Florida,so there is no need to empty the pool to put away for storage. I sent photo's to Intex and they're reply was to buy replacement parts! Was not happy."
2,leaky summer,"The price and free shipping was great! I put the pool together, filled it. And there was a leak from the manufacturer when it was made! What are you going to do, empty all that water out, undo everything and repack it to send it back. I don't think so!!! You are stuck with it! :("
4,Nice except the pump.,"The set up on this pool is relatively easy even with the 113 degree weather that day. We leveled the ground before we received the pool. The ground cloth is a must. Also, it is really necessary to put small blocks under each leg. With kids splashing water out, they will sink and cause it to not be level. The pump that comes with the pool isn't strong enough to do a good job. Ours quit after three weeks. All attempts to get it primed and running again failed. I ordered a bigger one since we plan on buying a bigger pool when this one wears out."
3,Easy Set up,What can I say.... The pool is a great bargin but be prepared to spend more money on a better filter. Filter that comes with the pool is garbage. My pool water looked like the hudson river in NY in no time. So back to amazon I go to purchase a sand filter that is capable of doing the job right.
