4,Where is Mewes,"I loved this movie from the opening song till, I forget how it ends. I guess I shouldn't try to copy the two stoners. But my real reason for the review is to ask if anyone knows anything about Jason Mewes. I know he's addicted to heroine and wondered if anyone knows or knows of his present status. Is he alive or in jail. He isn't in any new movies and even though the new Kevin Smith flick isn't out yet, I figured he'd be in some stoner movies. If anyone knows about him just respond on the JSBSB reviews."
4,Good in its own right; Not as good as previous films,"I liked this movie. However, I came out of the theater disappointed because I felt that the dialogue was not as witty or insightful as the four other Kevin Smith movies I have watched. I thought that he referred to his prior movies far too much. I would have liked more original dialogue.That said, I really enjoyed the comedy. Having Mark Hamill in his scene was just a blast."
1,NO EXTRAS AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!,"Kevin Smith is reknown for including enough extra features to gag over for his films, as was the 2 DVD release of this film several years ago. Hello Blu-ray, good-bye extras. Pathetic."
1,Garbage,"When I was eleven or twelve I thought being offensive and swearing as much as possible just for the sake of being offensive and swearing was funny. Other than the first scene where the words used are funny because of the situation the movie has no more than a brief chuckle or two. The very over-rated Kevin Smith must have aimed this at twelve-year-olds even with the R rating, so if you are out of your adolescence don't waste your time. On the other hand, if you are over eighteen and have a twelve-year-old mentality, enjoy! Kevin Smith made this for you."
1,Save Two Hours of Your Life and Don't Watch This Movie,"Don't get me wrong, I think Kevin Smith has genius, but this movie doesn't touch it. This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. What was Smith out to do with this film? He wanted to see how many pot-smoking idiots(with all due respect to those who smoke pot) would shell out hard cash to see a movie in which every bad aspect of every other bad comedy was included. Is there anything good about this movie? Not much. Silent Bob(Smith) is the only character who is in the least bit interesting (besides the HOT female characters). The cameos have potential, but miss the mark. The rude humor isn't the least bit humerous, and the protagonist (Jay) is too stupid to exist. If you're looking for a humerous satire on Hollywood, this isn't it. If you want to see Kevin Smith's genius, see Dogma, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, or Clerks. If you want to kill braincells stay home and smoke pot."
2,"Always Raunchy, Often Disgusting, Rarely Funny","And definitely not worth buying. This movie dishes out nastiness that makes Friday the 13th seem quaint and lovable by comparison. Jay and Silent Bob are rotten people, and you will feel rotten after watching this fitlth. You might laugh a time or two, but you won't feel good about doing it."
5,LOL!,"a lot of cursing if your sensetive to that but the rest is so fuuny (especially the scooby doo part!) best lineJay (rapping)- 30 bucks little man, put that sh** in my hand!"
4,"Fun, silliness, and blunts. (Who's got the blunts?)","Sorry, I couldn't resist...I went to see J&SBSB upon the recommendation of a friend (who could easily get a career as a Silent Bob double), not knowing much about Kevin Smith films. I had an *indecent* amount of fun watching the movie, more than I ever expected to. It's stupid, it's silly, it's rude, it's socially unacceptable. As long as you know that and can - even for just 2 hours - suspend any lingering amounts of prudeness in your soul, you should find some memorable humor in the movie. I have a lot of friends who consider me too boring and prudish (yet also liberal, as I have a large number of gay friends) who would be shocked to know that I loved this movie.And somehow, that makes me happy."
4,Favorite Kevin Smith Film,"I love this film for essentially two reasons. It is consistently funny and it it's utter lack of pretense. Not since Cheech and Chong have two slacker potheads made such beautiful screen music. Jason Mewes is a great comic actor, though it is debatable whether he's just essentially playing himself. Shannon Elizabeth is incredibly foxy as Jay's love interest. Will Ferrell is hilarious in his role as an inept U.S. Marshall. Many amusing cameos, including the acting-challenged Ben Affleck. This disc contains alot of deleted scenes with intros by Smith and Mewes. These cut scenes, for the most part, are funny enough for inclusion in the finished product. Rumor has it that because of a promise that Smith made to Mewes that if he got clean there would be another Jay and Bob movie. Apparently, Mewes has done just that and Smith is keeping his end of the bargain."
4,A loving tribute for two wackjobs,"Kevin Smith writes and directs a fast paced and hilarious send off to his two beloved and disturbed characters. Jay and Silent Bob, the Rosencrantz and Gildenstern of Smith's world take one last journey in this spoof filled farce. This will never be considered a cinematic masterpiece but for fans of the directors work this is a fitting transitional piece.Jay and Silent Bob will be missed."
5,Hilarious!!,"Okai, let me just say that I have been an extreme lover of Jay and Silent Bob from their little tiny appearances to their big screen. Although they are ALWAYS crude and gross, and not so smart, and sometimes demeaning to women, they really make me laugh. And I am a woman! This movie is so funny. I laughed through the whole thing, endlessly. In every movie they are in, they make me laugh, and one of the things I really liked about this movie is that it had all these different parts and situations from all their past indie films. For example, the Chasing Amy characters and situations as well as some of the Mall Rats cast members and Dogma, too. This is just a funny movie full of silliness and stupidity. Sure, it's distasteful and sick and demented and rude and gross and raunchy but I loved it!!! But if you know Jay and Silent Bob, you're quite prepared for the type of movie this will be. :) Go Kevin Smith!! I love that guy!!"
3,Jay and Silent Bob...,"The reason I gave this a three star rating is because the disc had come loose in the case and had a LOT of surface scratches, though I did make sure that it still worked. Because of this incident I was unable to say if the item was described appropriately or not."
4,Funny as Ish,Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back [Blu-ray]Very few movies were I was LMAO watching it for the first time and this is one of them. It's an all-time classic comedy IMHO. The Blu ray quality is an improvement vs the DVD version but not as crisp as other Blu Ray versions of movies released around this time. Would rate it a 3/5 in terms of the improvement in the Blu Ray vs DVD versions
3,"Funny, but Very Low Quality","While the dialog was pretty hilarious, this film was often painful to watch. The editing is horrible. It has no sense of pacing or rhythm about the scenes and transitions. There's a whole lot that should have been tightened-up in postproduction. The sound editing is also lackluster. That lightsaber scene almost made me fall asleep -- the sound fx was SOOO quiet and subdued compared to the music and dialog. Too much of the postproduction on this thing reminds me of a film student's first school project. Even if this stuff had been fixed it would still only get 4 stars, because some the jokes get a bit tiresome and the acting sucked."
3,Has it's moments.,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Jay and Silent Bob are always the hidden treasures in the Kevin Smith films. So, why not make a movie featuring them? Great potential but I think these characters work better as bit players rather than stars. The inside jokes were hysterical, as were the disgusting antics of Jay. The whole middle part of the movie and the monkey plot just dragged.Good for a quck trip down memory lane and a few laughs. Not a great movie - but who said it would be anyway?"
4,Great Movie,"Jay and Silent Bob is a great movie. If you've seen any of their movies in the past, this one will not let you down. If you have never seen a J&SB movie before, you better be in for a lot of the F word.The movie is packed with big stars and lots of laughs. The Bong Saber scene between Mark Hamille(Luke Skywalker) and J&SB is my favorite, but there are tons more great scenes.Oveer all, I give Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back a four out of five stars."
2,Meh...,"I feel like Kevin Smith said to the world: 'Okay, folks, you wanted a movie entirely about Jay and Bob? Even though it couldn't possibly be as funny as you seem to think? Well, here you go.' And in the meantime, he also decided to make fun of the studio execs who no doubt were also pushing him to make a movie that was sure to pull in millions at the box-office. And based on what? Name recognition and cameos. So I suppose if you want to see all the old characters from the other Smith movies thrown together, saying the same things they did in the other movies, go for it. I suppose, to be fair, it's hard to top a movie like 'Dogma.' That movie may have had its share of cameos, but at least Jay and Bob were funny."
1,bad humor. bad acting. bad script.,"I highly suggest you rent this before buying it. If you're waxing nostalgic, thinking that perhaps Kevin Smith has regained something from his Clerks/Mallrat days, you'll be sorely disappointed.The thing I loved about Kevin Smith was that he had intelligent humor. He was funny. He was witty. And the cast complemented his vision. Even though he wrote what some people would refer to as ""trash"", he wrote it well and made me laugh.I did not experience any moments during this movie that made me laugh out loud. There were times I chuckled to myself, but overall this whole movie was a disappointment. Kevin Smith is relying more on shock value, controversy accompanied by publicity to make people see his movies. this is one person who will never see another movie he makes. buh bye."
1,Obnoxious movie,"I guess being older somewhat dulls the senses to what is hip or not, but I found the film bad. Vulgar is sometimes vulgar and this movie is. I was embarrassed to be in the room with teenage girls watching this, because it didn't deliver enough laughs or have a clever enough premise to cover the foul language.I think the voting on this is the ""emperor's new clothes"" syndrome. It just isn't cool to be contrary to the new hip talent...It is also a lame attempt at counter-culture quasi-intellectualism. Who the heck cares if these people are really intelligent or not? The movie isn't entertaining and that's what these artists are suppose to be doing, not qualifying me for mensa."
1,Foul-mouthed and horrible,"I don't mind an occasional foul-mouthed remark from characters in a film but this film takes profanity to new lows. What's worse is that this film is only marginally funny as many of the jokes simply fail to deliver. Unless you enjoy ""comedy"" geared towards...enraptured teenagers, please stay away from this atrocity."
5,The best one so far,"THis movie rocked it was better than the other 4 movies befor it (Clerks, mall rats, chaseing amy, and Dogma) I have seen this movie three times it's better after you have seen the first ones becouse it makes alot of refranses to them espeshilly chaseing amy."
1,A disappointment,"When I first purchased this, I really did enjoy it and thought it was funny, but as I've grown in my spiritual pilgramage, it's nothing but stupid humor and an outrage. I can't believe that the MPAA rated this movie PG-13 with all the foul language. I have since then destroyed BOTH CD's and thrown them into the garbage, never to be played again."
5,a review of jay and silent bob strike back in 17 syllables,"bob and jay, proud, wisewarriors of the green landbehind Stop n Go"
1,"I like Kevin Smith movies, but...","this movie bites, period. The others were brilliant, all of them. Not a bad one in the bunch, until this useless heap."
5,to all yall little f*ckers that think other wise,"This movie was the bomb. jay and silent bob are the two funniest characters ever. there journey to stop a film that is being made about them is so hilarious. there was basically no plot to this movie but there didn't need to be. Will farrell did a SICK job in this film ""damn these guys are good"""
2,Not very good.,"I rented this the other night and was disappointed to say the least. I like Kevin Smith's other movies, and I think anyone else familiar with his work will agree with me when I say JASBSB is lacking. Sure, it had it's funny moments.... However, the kind of humor and wit present in Kevin Smith's other movies is totally lacking in JASBSB, and was for the most part substituted with high-school level toilet-humor that really got old after a while. To anyone new to Kevin Smith's movies, do yourself a favor and go buy Clerks and Mallrats before watching this one."
2,VERY bad HD transfer...,"First off, I normally would not have wasted my money on a HD title such as this one; it was included in a eBay lot of Blu-ray discs which I purchased... After 5 minutes of watching I had to press the eject button on my PS3 and check the disc again, because it looked like a normal DVD upscaled to HD... Very poor image quality..."
5,Made in heaven!!!,"As a die-hard Star Wars AND a Kevin Smith fan, this is trully a project of heavenly proportions!!! In case anybody hasnt noticed, Kevin Smith is a loyal Star Wars advocate. He makes reference to it in EVERY movie, and in EVERY episode of Clerks: The Animated Series!! This new movie will definitely be the pinacle of both worlds!!! I mean, Silent Bob is in a lightsaber duel with Mark Hamill!!! Who else but Kevin Smith would even DARE to do that??! As a Star Wars fan, I have to personally thank Kevin for bringing Mark Hamill, in the way we all knew him, back to the big screen!!! I haven't even seen the movie yet, and I already know it will be on my top five favorites of ALL-TIME!!! I'm more proud as ever to be a Kevin Smith decipal!!!Move over Matrix 2, Star Wars has some REAL competition now!!!"
2,A giant ...fest,Yeah let's take the 2 most annoying charecters in every Kevin Smith movie and give them their own movie .Jay and silent bob make Bill and Ted seem almost cool .The problem with the movie it takes too many shot's at things that have been made fun of a ton of times already.Take the she's all that joke I mean it is pretty easy to pick on a corny movie from 3 or so year's ago .Also I think the film maker has one too many issues with gay people .Not that I was offended or am any kind of gay right's activist its just that if your 20 or so minute's through the movie and you've heard about a dozen or so... and gay jokes it makes you wonder what the film maker is hiding in his closet.Also too many jokes that try to pretend to be insider hollywood jokes that just are not that funny.The only thing that saves this movie from being all bad is a few choice laughs from Will Ferrel and Chris Rock.
2,OMG.. they spent money to make this??,"I found this movie markedly unentertaining. The storyline was bizarre at best. Most of the jokes were not funny and wereobviously given very little thought. Repeating the word""f"" word really does not constitute humor. The only redeemingcharacter in the movie was Chris Rock who was funny as usual.The rest of the movie is peppered with cameos by overrated unproven Hollywood actors/actresses. I would not recommendthis as I feel it was a waste of money -- wait for video if at all!!"
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,No plot. Stupid jokes. Really really jouvinille. It tries to save itself with a whole lot of hollywood in jokes and cameos but it doesn't work. Give me back my two hours. It was awfull.
2,Disappointing,"After a strong start, <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i> fizzles into a lame middle section before re-gaining a little strength at the end. Following the near-epic comedy of <i>Dogma</i> and the important comedy of <i>Chasing Amy,</i> you'd think Kevin Smith would be just as successful with a screwball comedy.He's not. Without a framework to hang the jokes on, he has to invent plot contrivances rather than letting the story unfold, and only about a third of the movie really succeeds.On the plus side, the DVD release is primo, with a wealth of additional material to complement the superb audio/video film presentation. All DVDs should be made with this much ambition and value for the buyer."
1,I cant stand these characters,"Am i the only one out there tired of these two? They were the worst part of Clerks, Dogma and Mallrats. SO repetitive. OK. One guy talks a lot, one doesn't, haha. Now they have their own movie. Man, they stink."
4,yeaaaahhhhhh!!!!,"jay n silent bob rock!!! being from jersey helps, but hey, its all good! funny, very funny, and the additional dvd with special features makes it even funnier and a worth while buy! jason mewes rocks man! silent bob, well, he's very uhm, silent, but funny nonetheless! if you wanna check out a flick thats just plain nonesense comedy, this ones for you! jungle looooveee, oui oui oh!"
4,A lot of crude fun,"...I saw only one other J and SB movie (Dogma, which aside from Mooby has little to do with this movie) and yet it made sense. It might be useful to check out Clerks and Chasing Amy to see who Dante and Randal are and to see about the comic Bluntman and Chronic.That said, the first time through I was nearly falling in the floor laughing at this movie. It is incredibly profane and I will admit that the constant gay jokes got to be irritating, but there is way more good stuff than bad. I can certainly see why some people would hate this movie (like my mom) but it is really hilarious. Also contains some great satire of Hollywood and internet message boards."
3,"By far not the best Kevin Smith film, but still a great time...","It's been a long time since I've seen this film and to be honest had I not recently bought a Blu-ray it may have been an even longer time...but I like Kevin Smith. And I wanted to support the guy. And add to my collection. And you know what? I'm glad I did. This is a great price for what stands up to be a pretty funny flick -- and even though it's not loaded with extras the commentary was worth the pricetag for me. I just love hearing the dude pal around with Mosier and Mewes etc...Is this the best Viewaskeniverse movie? In my book, far from it. But it's also not the worst...If anyone's wondering, my ranking would be: Chasing Amy/Dogma (tied depending on my mood), Clerks 1, Jay & Bob/Clerks 2 (tied), MallratsSo there you have it. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. And DEFINITELY pick up ""An Evening With Kevin Smith"" (1, 2, and 3 is out soon)...those are amazing, even to non fans I've shown them to."
4,Better on blu,You either get this film or you don't. If you are already a fan you will love it in HD. It is quite an upgrade from the SD version.
2,Tries too hard,"During the first 15 minutes of this film I was so utterly bored I thought of turning it off. If you can survive to the end of the film, there are some funny moments however. I thought they were trying too hard to mimic a John Water's type film, where it sounds like they are deliberately reading their lines in monotone. George Carlin saved the movie and he was only in it a few minutes. If you have nothing else to do, then watch it, but don't go out of your way to see this. Definitely aimed at teenaged stoners...."
3,Don't Buy for the Extras,"While I enjoyed the movie itself, this DVD is extremely disappointing. The movie commentary (normally my favorite part of a Kevin Smith DVD) is boring and inane, and the extras on the second disc are little more than advertising for View Askew merchandise. After the spectacular Dogma DVD, this one is a huge letdown, doubly so because it's the end of the Jersey Trilogy."
2,Jason Mewes is the funniest thing about this movie...,I wanted to like this movie a whole lot more than I did. The humor just does not match up to Dogma or even Mallrats. Jason Mewes surprisingly had the talent to pull off leading star status. I definitely look forward to seeing him in future movies. My recommendation is to rent the movie.
1,Jay and Silent Bob Stirke Back,Watched it and quite frankly I did not understand what this movie was about. I gave this DVD away to a family member and they stated they did not understand also.
3,too much exposure....,"I remember seeing this at the cinema when it first came out. I think this is a movie where you need to have seen Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy (in that order) as the jokes build up throughout each moive. I still remember being the only the person laughing at certain parts while the people around me stared at the screen blankly.Having said that, I don't think that Jay and Silent Bob should have been made into the main characters. Or even have a movie named after them. It just made the movie seem really long and even I was having trouble sitting still through some parts of it. I think most people can only tolerate Jay and Silent Bob in small amounts, which is how they were presented in past."
3,"The worst of the five, but still watchable","I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, with my favorites probably being, oddly enough, Mallrats and Dogma. And while each of those movies has their own shtick, one perfecting stupid yinzer funny and the other being a truly witty comedy, Jay and Silent Bob take us nowhere after a promising first fifteen minutes of film.Too many junior high jokes for me, and you also get the feeling in this movie that Kevin Smith really begins to take himself seriously and believe all the hype, and you think that he may be laughing all the way to the bank.I'd like to see him get back to what he did in the other movies and leave the acting to the actors like Jason Lee and others.All the above being said, this movie still has enough truly funny one liners and scenes to keep us coming back for more. Probably five/ten years from now we'll be able to look back at this movie and look at it as a part of a collection of Smith works that had to occur."
4,Good stuff.,"Kevin Smith movies aren't for everyone. That's a good thing. It takes a special kind of person to get his humor and I thank God that I'm that kind of person. More so than any of his previous movies, you not only need to get Kevin Smith to enjoy this film but you also need to know him. Jay & Silent Bob is described as one big inside joke; it's an accurate description. If you've never seen Clerks (what's wrong with you?!), Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, there's a good chance you won't understand the backstory well enough to laugh. Except during the George Carlin, Carrie Fisher and Scooby scenes; they speak for themselves. As long as you know these movies, though, you're in for a treat and a slew of deleted scenes."
4,Kevin Smith Gies his Fans a big Sloppy One,"This movie is the kind of movie that you would hope a director so in tune with his fans would make, it hits every favourite ""Askewniverse"" cliche and hams it up for the camera at every opportunity.However; this is so much of a fan movie it may turn off anyone who has not seen the other movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma.) Also, anybody who read the Graphic Novel ""Chasing Dogma"" also starring the two titular stoners will recognise a great deal of the plot from that little work here on the screen (although it was sorely missing DOOGIE NIGHTS.All in all the movie achieves what it sets out to do, make the viewer laugh and cheer for the main characters, snoogans."
2,Too much of a good thing...,"I loved the other four movies and was looking forward to this one a lot. Was there really that much swearing in the other four or am I just getting old? Jay and Silent Bob were my favorite characters in the other movies, but give them the title roles and I thought they lost their appeal. I didn't think they were as funny for 2 hours straight as they were in small doses. I still love the other four movies, (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma) so check them out even if you didn't care much for this one."
5,Just like winnie the pooh...,"This movie is the greatest comedy of all time, straight up in your face humor. Constant swear and gay jokes makes this oh so retarted but great. Kevin Smith needs to make another movie like this cause jay and silent bob carry the comedy while people like Holden and TS maintain the story. Also watch the deleted scenes there is a deleted running joke that involves a donkey show and the word a** c**k. It is the the bomb.snoogans..."
4,Classic,"This movie is great, a little obscene but none the less an instant classic, however i would of gave it five stars if it were Jay and Sponge bob!!!"
1,"Awful, Just Awful","""Mallrats"" is better than this. ""Mallrats"" had characters, at least. ""Jay And Slient Bob"" doesn't have characters; it's a stream of profanity and hit-n-miss jokes with a bunch of cameos from previous Smith movie characters and acting alumni. You start wishing that the cameo players would stick around and that Jay and Silent Bob would disappear.I am glad to hear that Smith is closing the book on this world of characters.""Die-hard fans"" (I guess I'm not one of them) should love the two-disc set. It's loaded with deleted scenes, a couple music videos, etc. There's a funny bit where Morris Day is teaching Smith how to dance. I haven't gotten through all the extras yet, but a film of this quality doesn't deserve this kind of treatment."
2,Kevin smith has lost all his charm,"Kevin Smith's four previous films were awesome I enjoyed all them and I own all of them, however I was horribly dissaponted by this movie for several reasons. The movie consints of stupid one liners, lame visuals, several teeny bopping guest stars, and this movie went over the top with crude language that it just insults the viewers intelligence. Some good points of the film were the performances of will ferral and chris rock which were the only parts of the movie that I thought were actually funny. Unless you are between the ages of 12-14 or a hard core stoner avoid this flick and pick up one of kevin smith's other movies."
2,"If you like fart jokes, sex jokes and overuse of the f-word","Watching this, I was reminded of all the crazy movies I loved as a kid - classic laughfests of the like of ""Strange Brew"" and ""Still Smokin'."" This is the same sort of gross humor, pothead sillyness except it at times goes a little over the top. Of course, maybe I think that because now I'm 34 and not 12. I do have to give Kevin Smith thumbs up for the use of his ""friends"" and the Ben and Matt scene in ""Good Will Hunting 2"" is one for the ages. If you like fart jokes, sex jokes, overuse of the f-word and otherwise just pointless humor, then you'll love this. Everyone else - consider yourself warned."
5,Snoothies!,"Finally, a movie with Jay and Silent Bob as the main characters! I've seen Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, which were all great especially when Jay and Silent Bob are on screen. Now, they star in their own movie and is the final and the BEST of Kevin Smith's Jersey ""trilogy"" series.Jay and Silent Bob are headed to Hollywood to trash a movie, based on a comic book ""Bluntman and Chronic"", which is based on them, after knowing their not getting any profit. On the way they meet all kinds of characters and there are LOADS of movie stars in this flick. The best and a very good farewell bid to Jay and Silent Bob by Kevin Smith. Hopefully not!"
4,For Kevin Smith Fans,"I really liked the movie. Lots of self referential gags make it a must to have seen the other Kevin Smith movies. This is a sort of formula road picture with a couple of characters I have really grown to love. This is in the same class as movies like Strange Brew which take familiar characters and give them a simple plot line to follow. No great surprises but surprisingly witty in parts. This is a straight low brow comedy with none of the controversy of Dogma. If you are looking for the somewhat awkward but brilliant dialogue from some of Kevin Smiths other films you may be disappointed, but as a straight buddy road movie it delivers all the laughs."
2,Only for big fans (and still a disappointment),"I didn't see this in the theater, but I bought it the other day (so that explains it). The story is pretty weak, but the jokes spread throughout are pretty good.....I guess. The Will Ferrell stuff is worth it, but the movie didn't need to be made. I think that when a director gets to this point, they should just implant some sh#t like in Total Recall, as if you had seen the movie. Money was wasted and cameos are stupid. PS: The stuff with Kevin Smith's wife stuff is grandstanding and stupid. He just talks about getting laid and how now that he's married...etc. Who cares?"
5,Jay & S. Bob Genius - But The Kev Talks To Long,"This movie is pure gold and worth the money. I love all of the extras. There are tons of deleted scenes in this movie as well as some informative comentary. I believe Kevin Smith tried to make it two discs. He just talked to freakin long in between the deleted scenes and I almost took it down a star because of it. But you can hit next scene to just skip over ""Not-So-Silent Bob""(no offense meant to this great director). All and all it was a great movie, but to get the real feel for the characters you should see Kevs other 4 movies (especially Mallrats, then Dogma if you're open minded, then Chasing Amy if your a girl, & then Clerks if you don't mind low budget black and white)."
1,Who made this?,"Charles Chaplin said that make a person laugh, was thew most difficult thing to do in the world, he was right. From the first minute to the last one this movie isn't funny, the acting it's awful, people trying to make people laugh. No plot, bad dialogues and two pathetic guys. Who wrote this trash? This is a ood example of how movies are right now. Don't waste time with this thing and buy a better one."
1,Horrific!!!!!,"This movie has got to be the worst movie of all time. It is nothing but downright offensive. When I watch this movie, I realize what is wrong with our world. It is full of nothing but the ""f"" world and back to back toilet humor. Anyone who finds this movie amusing should have his/her head examined!!!"
4,Raunchy fun,"I got this DVD early, using my super-secret connections (the ""CD Warehouse"" in crossroads mall), and let me tell you, it's damn-good! The film explores the subjects of the internet and the film industly, but the extras are also very good. The deleated scenes are actually funny, as is the commentaty about them.I don't know how Kevin Smith does it, but I liked EVERYONE in the cast, even people who I usually hate (Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, to name a few). Well, basicaly, talk about going out with style. The only problem is the apperance of non-stop gay jokes, that would kind of negate ""Chasing Amy,"" were it not for a brief doilogue between Biggs and Van Der Beek about homophobia."
5,Kevin Smith Strikes Back!,"Kevin Smith goes all out in his latest movie. This film is, in my opinion, his greatest yet. The New Jersey and camio cast is impressive, the humor is outstanding and there are plenty of references to previous Smith films to keep the audience reminising. I infaticly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great laugh and doesnt mind hearing the ""F"" Word a few times."
5,that's punk rock,I love every thing about Kevin Smith's movies. I also love Jason Mewes. He is very funny and sexy. I really hope to see more of Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes in the theaters. You two have always cracked me up. Now THAT'S PUNK ROCK!
3,They go from jersey to LA to stop a film about them,"The dynamic duo travel from New Jersey to Los Angeles to stop a movie from being made about them because people made fun of them on an internet message board. But the film gets made, they get rich, they then find everyone who posted negative comments about them on the internet and beat them up to the song ""How Many People Wanna Kick Some Ass?"" by Stroke 9."
2,hmmm....,I don't know....Al of the Kevin SMith movies are sooo good. I don't know what happened with this one. Sure it's got it's laughs. but I just think it's way to commercial. Something is just lacking with this film. Like he tried to do too much. I will still buy the DVD because i love Kevin Smith movies but this one is the weakest in the series... But It's only one opinion...
5,FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS,"JAY AND SILENT BOB IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIS THAT I HAVE SEEN, THE SPECIAL DVD HAS AND EXTRA DISC OF DELETED STUFF THAT IS FUNNY TO. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE EXCEPT LITTLE KIDS, AND UPTIGHT OLD PEOPLE. I THINK KEVIN SMITH IS THE BEST MOVIE MAKER OUT THERE TODAY ,I ENJOY ALL OF HIS MOVIES, CHECK THEM ALL OUT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE KID OR AN UP TIGHT OLD PERSON."
2,Stale and Uninspired,"Two hours of self-referential humor, (""Oohhh, lookie! We looking at the audience again! Whoo, we so funny!""), and jokes stale enough to make the writers of ""Family Matters"" cringe. That about sums it up. If you're a fan of Smith's other movies, you'll probably eat it up, because he recycles jokes from all his other movies. I didn't hate it, but it sure seemed like a big ol' waste of money. I was glad to see Jason Mewes actually ACTING for a change - and doing a half-decent job at it, too. Otherwise I was checking my watch all throughout."
1,Be very careful with cats!!,"I applied this product only ONCE a week for two weeks on my cats lower back. This product worked very well in stopping my cat from chewing, licking and pulling his hair out. Unfortunatly my cat age 14 in perfect health except this issue had a severe reaction to Synergy Dr. Golds Itch Relief. He stopped eating, drinking and in one week lost an alarming amount of weight. I rushed him to the vet and he was given IV fluids and antibiotics. The inside of his mouth was red and inflamed. My vet said he obviously had a reaction to the product which I brought with me. I now take my cat to the vet once every 3 months to recieve an allergy shot. My cat is now back to his old self. The product worked, BUT BEWARE the results. An allergy shot is only $28.00 and alot safer and works perfectly."
1,Only If You Must,"This is the worst book in its category, full of contradictions within itself and with its textbook to. Read it only if you must, and only after reading other books when preparing for exams."
3,Just one thing.,"I have looked unsuccessfully for ""People Who Died"" for many years. It is a stunning song. The only reason I ever listened to Beck is because his style, at first, resembled that of Carroll."
1,NYC...heroin...Burroughs...yadda yadda yadda,"The first time I heard ""People Who Died"" I nearly fell off my chair laughing, I still think it's one of the funniest songs ever written. It just goes to show that the people who've ""lived the life"" aren't necessarily the best ones to mediate it into art. Insensitive, imaginative voyeurs like Lou Reed or even god help us the Strokes generally get the job done better."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received the flamingo lights. The lights did not work and they looked like they were sitting on a shelf for 10 years. My husband, who is an electrician tried to change the fuse and lights that were provided without success. My husband said the quality of manufacturing was poor because several of the light sockets failed to operate. Shipping took a long time. The company did send a replacement, which worked. Due to the long wait between shipping I was unable to use the product."
2,"Nice looking, but problems","One string worked great, the other, despite replacing every bulb, I couldn't get to work. Packaging is not great for storing after use. Too bad, I really liked the look of them."
4,Great for parties and halloween,"This was used during a Halloween theme event. Our family decorate each year at Halloween with a new theme. this was the first we did Alice. Years later we still get people who mention our costumes and the theme was requested that we do it again. The lights added to our theme, and it was instrumental in making a great statement and it came in good shape and only required minor adjustments. once again it was perfect and we will do it again."
1,Sony Handycam DCR-DVD101E,"My works bought 3 of these cameras and they gave the IT Department nothing but headaches, they simply will not play the dvds in computers, so basically they are a waste of time. I thought IT may be doing something wrong, or perhaps some works software was stopping it all, so 4 years later I signed one out, brought it home, tried it, no joy at all, nothing doing with drivers or anything. I looked on Youtube, some young lad had a dazzle and so I bought a used dazzle, again, nothing at all. I tried Sony help centre, but after the 5th page requesting my Great Grandfathers DOB and National Insurance number, I gave up. Avoid even buying a used one, for less than a tenner."
3,"Not Sure What They Were Going For, Yet Still Passable","Kix took a step back with ""Cool Kids."" While not a bad album, there are only traces of hard rock in the sound and Kix sounds confused over what they hope to accomplish. For some reason, synthesizers are prevalent, which did not really go well with their sound. ""Mighty Mouth"" and ""For Shame"" are the only songs that would fit on any of their other albums, and ""Get Your Monkeys Out"" could be the best cut, if it were allowed to rock out a bit more. The fun vibe is still obvious in the songs, though. Despite an unworthy followup to the excellent debut, the album is not without some merit, and even with questionable material, Kix retained their crown as party rock champions."
1,laughable,After reading such laudable reviews I figured I'd hear the 30 second samples. I believe every one of those songs could fit in nicely while the credits were rolling for revenge of the nerds 3. Truely a waste of 5 minutes.
1,laughable,After reading such laudable reviews for this album I just had to hear the 30 second clips. I do believe any one of those songs could be playing while the credits rolled for revenge of the nerds or some teen angst movie of the 80's. What a waste of 5 minutes.
5,"Beautiful, just beautiful",I don't have much to really add to all the great reviews already here but I would like to add the weight of my opinion for whatever it counts. All I can really say after watching this show is: Beautiful.
2,"if you're a classic rock fan, you'll be dissapointed...","I appreciated the rap/hip-hop in this movie even though it isn't what I normally would listen to. It is unfortunate that they didn't include some of the great classic rock songs because they were just as crucial as the rap songs in the attempt to capture the viewers. It's a shame that they couldn't have compiled a better variety, but the soundtrack is decent none the less."
1,Not what I expected...but...,"This is a Rap/Hip-Hop CD! I just saw the movie and there's a wide diversity of music in the sound track that is NOT on this CD. If you're a rap fan you'll probably be satisfied. The movie also had a LOT of very cool country/bluesy guitar instrumentals that I loved; they had TONE to the max, they were fantastically performed, recorded and produced, they made the hairs on my arms stand on end -- and they are not on this CD. Note to the marketers/producers -- I'm not buying this CD... the CD I want isn't to be had...CDNOW didn't put listening samples on the page for the Clean version but you can find them on the page thay made for the EXPLICIT LYRICS version."
2,Like Aweful movies?,"Well this is for you!Bad acting, bad script or just plain bad everything!This set SUCks & not in the fun way"
5,I'll tell them I remember you.,"This book ranks near the top of my reading list. The book tells about Bill Blatty's mother. She had a dominneering personality, very strong opinions about what is right and good and usually got her way when she decided she wanted to do something. I identified her with my mother. There was a sentence in the book that I will always carry with me. It read, ""She kept the joys, struggles and sorrows of all her life in the chapel of her heart where she prayed alone."" The book has humor, love, adventure and the personal touch of the author. I heartly recommend it to anyone who bonds with people"
1,Johnston's book is better,"This book is pretty lame, especially compared to ""The Complete Book of Golf Games"" by Johnston."
3,Good coverage but examples get in the way,"As expected, this book provides a general overview of information systems, including the nature of information, the components of an information system, how information systems are used in businesses, design and implementation techniques, and security considerations. I appreciate the broad coverage this book offers, as well as the infusion of real-world examples and case studies throughout the book. However, the inclusion of examples gets a little annoying when it interferes with the authors' explanation of a concept. At some points in the book, I felt that the authors included examples that didn't make sense considering what they were trying to explain. Much of the space could have contained a little more in-depth information, rather than the ""peppering"" of examples that may or may not be relevant. The book provides a good starting place for readers to discover their interests in the field, but the writing style was disappointing."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,"This is the worst book ever. Definitions and concepts are ambiguous, incosistent and sloopy. When explaining the difference of closely related terminologies, the author seems to be going off tangent, without explaining the actual difference.[Please note: I seldom give negative reviews. Trust me, stay away from this book.]"
3,Fell apart,"Only hours after having received the BebePod, the center nob popped off. I picked it up by the nob and it popped off. We glued it back on with epoxy, but it should not have been able to pop off so easily. My baby picked it up before we fixed it while in the seat and started chewing on it. I recommend the brand that makes the chair in one solid piece."
3,Fraggle Rock's ONLY Small Tape,"It Is 28 Years Old & Still Working, But The 2 Songs ""The Doozer March"" & ""Why"" Were Used On The 1983 Sing Along Tape. Overall, It The Only Shortest Fraggle Rock Tape They Made, But It Is What It Is."
3,sizes. what are the sizes.,sizes. what are the sizes. I think the sizes are 1/4 5/32 5/16 11/32 3/8 7/16 1/2 and mm 6 7 8 9 10 11 12from ebay
4,Where are the lyrics?,"Very good reissue and remastering, but where are the lyrics? I know,the original version did not have them, but it was something that could be added in this new version. Also, there's not a single photo of good old bassist Mark Evans... As for the songs, remastered or not, we all know them by now, and they're all fantastic."
3,BON CAN DO BETTER,"This is my least favorite of the Bon Scott albums (although I still haven't tried '74 Jailbreak). Problem Child is a good song but it is really the only one I like on here. If you're looking for some old Bon Scott albums, I would recommend them in this order.......1)Powerage 2)Highway To Hell 3)High Voltage 4)If You Want Blood 5)Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap 6)Let There Be Rock"
2,Better Days Ahead,"Sorry, I am going to disagree with the masses here. Just because an album is loud does not make it good. AC/DC would write more melody driven songs on Highway To Hell and Back In Black. This release just sounds way too similar from track to track with little in terms of compelling hooks.The highlight of this recording is clearly the last track, Whole Lotta Rosie. Excellent guitar riffs and solos by the Young boys and Bon Scott gives a superb vocal performance. Let There Be Rock, Problem Child and Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be are decent tunes as well. However, the rest just doesnot distinguish itself.In others words, pass on this batch and go for Back In Black or Highway To Hell instead."
3,again good rockin music,Another addition to the catalog of AC/DC and provides bangin rock songs to pass the afternoon on sunny days while working on the car and drinking a beer.
5,Filler???,"Let me begin my review with the following question. Who in their right mind calls 'Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be' filler?? This is one of the most beloved AC/DC songs, and is a prime example of Bon Scott's lyrical genius.This album is home to four of AC/DC's concert staples: 'Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be', 'Bad Boy Boogie', 'Whole Lotta Rosie', and of course, 'Let There Be Rock'. It would be a great purchase for not just the casual AC/DC fan, but the casual rock 'n' roll fan as well.I would also encourage anyone who enjoys this album to purchase the Australian (original) version which contains 'Crabsody In Blue' instead of 'Problem Child'."
3,and the young brothers said....let there be rock!,"1977 Ac/dc released their album Let There Be Rock. Let there be Rock featured the great guitar boogie of Whole Lotta Rosie and Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be.Also included is Problem Child,Bad Boy Boogie, and Let There Be Rock.Let There Be Rock is a good early effort for Ac/dc, it ranks way above most of the Brian Johnson era albums, but at this point Ac/Dc didn't quite perfect their songwriting skills."
4,GOOD ALBUM,This is another top ac/dc album. It features 2 of AC/DC'S greatest songs in LET THERE BE ROCK - a bone crunching track with great guitar work from Angus. The other one is WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE. Another decent song is OVERDOSE which is very raw. The rest of the album is very good also.
4,"Much better than ""High Voltage""","""Dog Eat Dog"" is probably my favorite from this album. ""Problem Child,"" ""Whole Lotta Rose,"" and ""Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be"" are great rock songs. This is probably their louest, rawest album ever (the production value is on par with that of a concrete garage... probably an influence from punk) It's quite a leap from ""High Voltage."""
5,A must have,"This one is my favourite AC/DC album yet so far (Haven't heard High Voltage or Highway To Hell though).It's pure rock'n roll from beginning to end with an energy and raw power that is hard to resist. The title track is the best on the album and probably their best song ever, featuring killer solos by Angus Young and a good fast tempo which I love. In fact there are no bad songs on this album but tracks that standout(besides the title track) are ""Whole Lotta Rosie"", ""Bad Boy Boogie"" and ""Dog Eat Dog"".This is a must have for fans of early AC/DC and rock'n'roll in general, and you will surely headbang or play air-guitar at least a couple of times."
5,This album kicks-@ss big time.,"One of my all time favorite, raw, driving, hard and heavy rock'n'roll albums. I don't know what happened to them after this one, but if you want some really decent hard implosive music...buy this one."
3,"its ac/dc, what do you expect?","ac/dc still hadnt found the perfect beat yet, but there were getting closer. i still look on this as an album, with side one being weak & side two being incredible. the first two songs and overdose are all very weak and bad boy boogie is just okay, but the rest SHRED. whole lotta rosie might be the finest thing they've ever done. so this is worth owning after you have the ac/dc essentials (powerage, highway to hell, back in black)."
4,They don't make 'em like they used to!!!,"This album can really rock the house. Bon's screeching vocals and Angus' screeching riffs will make your ears bleed, but as Martha Stewart always says 'That's a good thing'. Probably one of the weaker Ac/Dc albums of the 70's but it's still a great look back to when rock ruled the air waves and a time when people would have laughed at names like P. Diddy. Buy it if you like Ac/Dc. If you don't... why are you even reading this. Best songs are Let There Be Rock and Whole Lotta Rosie, but the song Overdose shows why Angus have had a guitar playing duel with Jimi Hendrix."
5,"best band ever, in best cd ever.",everyone should own and listen to this cd. it is some of ac/dc's best work.
5,this is the time when Bon Scott stood at the mic,"this album almost makes you wish that Bon Scott was still on the mic. standout tracks on this album are ""Let There Be Rock"", ""Problem Child"" and ""Whole Lotta Rosie"". ""Problem Child"" sounds like it should be a B-side to ""TNT"". R.I.P. Bon"
4,ACDC LETS THERE BE ROCK!!!,"Extremely good! i only took 1 star off because a couple of songs were about 8/10 (or 4/5) so... anyway, I love punk and metal (bkack sabbath, motorhead, the clash. sex pistols, etc.) And i don't listen to just rock, but when my dad got me this cd i have been really into rock and acdc and playing the sngs on drums. YAY!!!"
1,garbage,"First off this this thing came with absolutely no directions. I unfortunatly ordered two of these things, and have yet to get them together correctly. I the wood is really cheap and is splintering everywhere. I have gotten 3 splinters in my hand already. The wood pieces the go into each other to form the table are not cut to the right size so its like impossible to get the table to put together right. I kinda got one together but it was a wobble uneven mess and looked ridiculous so i had to re take it apart. This table is just no practical. I will probably have to send it back."
4,Holds up well.,"I needed a large portfolio that holds 11x14 graphics and I was quite pleased with the quality of this portfolio. I think the only downfalls would have to be the small binder-like rings. I would have liked it a little bigger in capacity. And the whole thing is plastic so the cover does not stay open. But for me, since all it does is hold my artwork, it was a great choice."
4,Loved the expediency of the ship!,I just wanted to say thank you to Cove Girl for getting this off to me so quickly! I was behind in my reading for class and it came to me quickly enough for me to read up before a test! Thanks!
5,nice book,It is a nice book of astronomy. New datas and complete explanations make it worth reading!
1,Free to anyone who wants it,I felt I was reading a high school English paper from a kid who couldn't decide what he wanted the story to be. There are enough references to multiple events that it could have been a miniseries...if someone else were to write it. Truly disappointed in the misleading positive feedback on this book. I'm leaving it on a park bench for the next poor sucker to suffer through it.
3,collectors need this,a great book with so much information and excellent guides for identifying pieces..for serious collectors this book is a must have.
1,THIS IS NOT A BOOK,"....it is only 23 pages long, with lots of photos! This must be the reason why the number of pages does not appear under the product details! Don't buy this if you are looking for a detailed training text on developing trust, etc. For $11 this is not worth it! Mine is going back."
3,"The Good, The Not So Good, and The Bad","The good: 1) It's cheap, and 2) It's programmed for Mitsubishi. Easy to use.The not so good: In my opinion, the layout of the buttons is bad. ""Enter"" is neither near the numbered buttons, nor is it a large, easy to find button - you have to look for it, and for any guy that's just horrible. (Guys wanna operate a remote by reflex!)The bad: Mine died after 5 months: it wasn't thrown, didn't have beer spilled on it, no one stepped on it. Replaced the batteries, tried to sweet talk it... but it had just given up the ghost. Now I've gotta decide whether to gamble on buying another cheap one, or spend the big bucks for a real Mitsubishi remote.[One year later] I bought another Dynatron Miracle Remote, and it's worked great. Still not crazy about the buttons, but it works."
2,Doesn't do NetCommand,"This product does NOT perform all the functions of all Mitsubishi factory remotes; Mitsubishi big screen televisions feature NetCommand, which allows you to select the input device and control it. I understand why this remote doesn't allow you to remote control the input device, but NetCommand is essential to being able to use a Mits. big screen. I'm disappointed.It'd probably work OK if you have a non-NetCommand TV, though..."
5,A Low Cost Alternative For A Worn Out Remote,"I received this remote promptly and put in the batteries, and bam! I had full control over my Mitsubshi LCD television. There is no such thing as the perfect remote, it there was it would be expensive. Think about it, like a high end camera, large customizable user buttons. The bottom line is that it is cheap and you can use every feature that the original had. In some ways, I like this one better. Such as, the large mute button in the center of the circular control. (volume/channel). One can access input from two different places on the remote."
4,Miricale Remote,I have had 2 Mitsubishi TV's and both remotes went bad. I started searching for a replacement after using the RCA's universal remotes and others and i found the Miracle Remote. Well I wouldn't call it a miracle but it is a fantastic remote. Does everything the stock remote does and its priced right. Cant go wrong with this one!
5,Gets the job done.,"These are well-made. The tops are glued into the plastic tube, so they won't pop out in transport or upon getting dropped on the floor. What more can I say about such a simple product? If you need a one- and two-minute sand timer, I would recommend this product."
1,Do not waste your money!,"These two timers are very small, very poor quality, and filled not with what was shown on the picture. It was not worth paying for the shipping, and I was so-o disappointed. It is absolute waste of time/money."
5,Always Follow Your Heart,"Two Thousand Minnows is an amazing story about family, about hopes and dreams, and about never giving up. This book made me laugh and cry and reminded me that we should always follow our hearts! Thank you Sandra for writing such an extraordinary book."
5,A wonderfully personal story.,"From the time I started this book, I could not put it down. I usually have several books going at the same time but I read this start to finish uninterrupted. What a wonderfully personal story of a girl growing up in America. For me, it elicited the full spectrum of emotions. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."
2,Barely Readable,"Although I am sure that this book has some good advice, I am unable to read it. The authors wrote the entire book in a style that makes Elizabethan English easy to understand (and I don't mean Elizabeth II!) To top it off, all of the place names and names of the characters are exotic, with lots of consonants and exotic letter combinations. It is a shame since the overall structure of the book seems sound. This book is like driving a luxury car painted in a garish color. My advice is to read something else (like Clayson's ""The Richest Man in Babylon"")."
2,The style makes it Impossible to read this book.,This book is tedious to read due to its Shakespearean style. The authors should write in English and by that I don't mean Olde English. The lessons are interesting enough if you can get to the end of this book. It's too bad that the writing style is such a distraction to those lessons.
4,Revenge never tastes sweeter...,"...than when it's served on a cold autumn day, when your devious boss falls overboard, when the thought of your new love is on your mind...morning, noon, and night. Zimmerman does an excellent job of drawing the reader into a devilishly clever plot that's set in beautiful Northern Michigan. His characters are so life-like you can see the antagonists crawling out from beneath the rocks at corporate headquarters. The good guys are likeable because they're just like most Americans- hard-working, honest and trustworthy. And just when you've got the whole thing figured out, and you're ready to write off Intentional as a ""good read,"" Zimmerman throws you a real zinger for an ending that'll have you wishing there was more."
4,If John Grisham wrote for Cabela's....,"If John Grisham wrote for Cabela's, he might have wrote ""Intentional Acts.""Set in the great outdoors of Michigan, we have a classic David versus Goliath. Our hero is a sincere man -- and insurance agent -- who does his best to stand up to evil forces. ENRON executives are only plagiarists of insurance industry management.Chris Zimmerman writes an admirable novel. We care about his characters. Details of dubious corporate manipulation are well illustrated. You see how insurance corporate management manipulate their agents/representatives and abuse their valued clients to their own seedy, cowardly ends.The second half of the novel races to a climactic point. I found myself cheering when the bad guys get their due. Yet, I wonder how much of this novel is fiction?If you're an outdoorsman or an Independent Contractor insurance agent or you just like to see how a plan can come together, you will enjoy ""Intentional Acts."""
3,Helpful in Bible study,The Bible study group I am part of was studying the book of Revelation. I found this book helfup in that study.
1,"Bait, cancel order with excuse, create new supply, raise price","I ordered this CD changer 13 Aug, when it was listed at $28, only to be told in an email the next day that the ""product wasn't suitable to be shipped out"". But now, it must be modern miracle, they suddenly have 4 in stock, $7 higher at $35. Ain't online selling with Amazon as front of legitimacy great?Pioneer JDT1212 12-Disc CD Player Magazine"
2,It was worth the rental,"I'm so glad we didn't purchase this DVD. We borrowed it from our local library. The music is too loud throughout the entire DVD. You will be turning up the volume to try and understand what anyone is trying to say and turning it down for the songs. Background music plays while you are trying to hear the children who speak too quietly. I've had to watch it repeatedly with my 5 year old just to try and understand what words they are saying on the dvd and it's sometimes hard to match those with the spelling of the words when they are telling you what was said.If you watch this DVD, be sure you already have some basic knowledge of Chinese/Mandrin so at least if you can't hear what they're saying, you'll already know what the word sounds like when they spell it out."
4,OK DVD,"This DVD is interesting ; however, the accent is more Taiwanese. ( according to my nanny from China) Overall it is well done but the interactive part is a bit tricky for car use ( ie portable DVDs)"
3,Could be better,"Not easy to follow or particularly entertaining for my 3yo who doesn't have prior exposure to Mandarin Chinese. After buying this DVD, we tried another - Learning Chinese & English Together - which we found taught similar concepts in a clearer and more enjoyable format for young kids who were absolute beginners."
2,Not A Good Purchase,"Despite the high rating for this product, I, a native Chinese speaker found this DVD poorly presented.1. The whole image of this DVD feels very home-made, not professional at all. I think it's because of the sound system.2. The pronunciation is off (with a foreign accent).3. When the DVD introduces father (ba ba), it just shows a man's face - if you don't read English as a child, you'd have no clue what this man's face is meant. When the DVD introduces big present (da li wu), it has a child pushes a present forward. How a person who doesn't read know what it's trying to say - is the big bag da li wu?I wish I can return this DVD."
5,Good introduction to a useful language,"My daughters and I really enjoyed this video. The characters are appealing and the songs are pretty catchy. More importantly, the video teaches Chinese in a way that is really accessible to non-Chinese viewers. The dialogue was easy to follow without being stilted and the pace is natural. The fact that it's a DVD is also a big plus as the whole family can watch together. While I can't say for sure how effective it is compared to other language learning tools, I do notice that that we have picked up quite a few words and phrases and have begun to use them even when not watching the video."
4,my daughter's favorite,"We have quite a few ""learn Chinese"" DVDs and for some reason (that I clearly don't understand) this one is my three-year old's favorite. It features Billy (a boy who has a birthday) and Benbo (a dog that sings). One odd feature is the inconsistent sound volume. I find myself having to adjust the sound throughout the program. I give it four stars because it is the one my daughter wants to watch again and again.Frankly, I think the ""mei-mei"" tapes are much better. My daughter LOVED Sing & Dance with Mei Mei, but I haven't found it in DVD yet. We have a Mei Mei DVD about school, but it's a little over my daughter's head at this point and she doesn't really like it."
3,Only for big fans and collectors,"You must be an absolute Renaissance fan to buy this CD. Its the only way you'll cope with the poor quality of the recording. The selection of songs is adequate and it is a novelty to hear them without the orchestra and few instruments, like an unplugged session should be. Don't expect an overall high quality, better think of it as if you took your own personal recorder to a Renaissance improvised session, and you taped the moment."
2,I didn't like it,I found the book not interesting enough to catch my attention.I had high expectations having read other of his books.
3,Just for Pete Enthusiast,"Quality cannot be compared to Camel or Pete's studio recording.However, for collectors this CD may be one of candidate collection targets. Female vocal on ""Tell me"" and ""Spirit of the Water"" has never been available - Pete, Latimar or Rich Sinclair so far. Desha Dunnahoe (obvioussly a girl!) on bass sung well.You cannot expect too much from this live recording. Because the original ""Camel Live Record"" is too good and too skillful, this live recording by the tour members on this CD must have a slim chance to get a good evaluation.For Enthusiast and hard-core fan of Pete - a must have item. I personally bought and never regret."
3,Useful But Limited,"I recently completed a 19 day trip to Kyoto and Tokyo. If there is a perfect comprehensive guide to Japan I have yet to find it, despite buying 6 of them. I did find this guide very helpful for locating sights in two specific ways. First, they are numbered and the numbers are clearly shown on maps (at least for major cities). It is surprising how few guidebooks successfully accomplish this seemingly elementary and essential task. Second, the pictures were very helpful in spotting sights on the ground. I found that getting oriented in Japan was more difficult than in European countries I've visited and pictures really helped. Plus, it makes a great souvenir. I primarily used this book and ""Gateway to Japan"" for sightseeing. They made a good combination."
5,Great Guide!,"I lived in Japan for two years and I took a couple of guides with me. I love this one. It has beautiful pictures, lots of facts, and contact information for hotels and restaurants (although I think the internet is the best place to find hotels because it is more updated). Some attractions are especially treated in this guide with diagrams and cross-sections to explain the whole experience. It even mentioned my little town! This is the guide I bought for my sister when she came to visit! It's great!"
3,great for beginners,"These dvds are very slow paced and definitely for beginners. So if that's what you're looking for then its great. She spends a lot of time talking about breathing and posture. Which again is very helpful if you have never done pilates or yoga before. I found it VERY slow and kinda boring. It does provide some very good stretches, which leave me feeling great, but definitely did not provide the core work out I was hoping for."
3,Too Slow For Me,"This was my first Pilates dvd, which was given to me as a gift.She is pretty good. Her australian accent and the scenery is so peaceful. The techniques are really good. Great for an off day when you want something easy going.However, the reason I only gave it 3 stars is because it's just too slow for me to feel like I have worked out. Are all Pilates dvd's like this???Bottom line is that if you require heavy sweat and cardio to feel motivated, then this is definitely not for you."
2,Yawn... Is it over yet?,Boooring... slow... not the kind of workout that can get me motivated. The whole video was just bland... the clothes... the facial expressions... blaaah. I'm not saying the exercises don't work... I'm just saying it's hard to stay awake to finish the routine.
2,Intro for the Young Reader,"Aristotle for Everybody is a brief introduction to Aristotle aimed at the young reader. Its target audience is probably the inquisitive student in the 12-14 range who is seeking an overview of Aristotelian thought.I accidentally picked up this book after glancing at a couple of the reviews on this site. I was about to re-read some Aristotle and was seeking to re-acquaint myself with his particular style and language. This is definitely not the book for this purpose.Adler's text is clearly geared to the young reader who has not been introduced to philosophy. I do not mean this to be disrespectful but to help oher readers avoid my mistake. Adler, himself notes in the introduction that his initial thought was to title the work Aristotle for Children. Indeed for the young reader this may not be an inappropriate mechanism for introducing Aristotle."
5,"Getting Aristotle, at last","I have made several runs at Aristotle (trying to understand him), but they all failed until I got this book.At last, I am beginning to understand Aristotle's idea of the ""formal cause,"" which comes along with his set of four causes. For example, I pick Michelangelo's statue of David.The ""material cause"" (strange wording) is: marble.The ""efficient cause"" is: Michelangelo.The ""formal cause"" is: (here difficulties arise) either the form in Michelangelo's mind, or the form of the male body.The ""final cause"" is: Michelangelo's desire to create a supreme work of art.We moderns don't think this way any more. Is that a plus, or a minus??In any case, if you want a beginner's course in Aristotle (a man who dominated philosophy for two thousand years or more), this book is highly recommended."
5,A Great Traveling Surf Story That We All Can Relate To,"Siesta and Olas is a great story of two traveling surfers on a journey in Mexico. The only similar comparison is the original Endless Summer movie. Great story, strong commentary, and a lot of fun to watch."
2,they sould of called in mainland mex surf trip,"This movie is the biggest rip off of Bruce Brown around. The narration is horrible and the surfing is average at best. The only stylish surfer is Joel Tudor (of course), but the only good part is the end with the massive waves. They talked of Baja for about 5 minutes then the rest has to do with mainland mex. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere."
2,Ho Hum,This could have been a lot better. As it was you really don't get the true feeling of the man
3,GREAT STORY-BAD HISTORY,"This movie does a great job in portraying how things were in the late 50s but it takes too many liberties with the historical facts. First, Ernie Davis was striken with lukemeia while preparing for the College All Star Game in Chicago, not the Coaches All Ameican Game as the movie shows. Ernie played in that game in Buffalo and was booed by the crowed for not signing with the Bills, who offered him more money than the Cleveland Browns did. Second, in the flash back scene showing Jim Brown signing his first pro contract with the Browns in 1957, Art Modell's name is mentioned. Modell did not own the team then, he bought the team four years later. Lastly, the movie shows the Syracuse team travelling to Dallas for the 1960 Cotton Bowl on a bus. I find it hard to believe that a team playing for the national championship even back then took a bus for a trip half way across the country. Still, however, this is a good movie for the story it tells."
5,The Express: The Ernie Davis Story,"Truly enjoyed this movie, The Express: The Ernie Davis Story. Should be inspiring to students who need modivation and to parents/grandparents who strengthen young people not to give up. Movie kept attention of viewer, well written."
5,sports dvd,"Great transaction. I love sports dvds, especially true stories. The Express is one of my all time favorite dvds and I would recommend it."
4,Hey Tokyo Jo,"The film was good, although it failed to compare to ""Remember the Titans"" in terms of the racial difficulties of the times being portrayed accurately.To TOKYO JO, who whined that someone ruined the movie by telling how it ends: Hello idiot, it was based on a true story! If you didn't know Ernie died of Leukemia, then you know little of football history. I guess you got upset when someone told you the boat sank in Titanic too! Get a life!"
4,football movies,"if you collect football movies like i do,you need to add this one to your collection,great story based on real events,sad how somebody who was a good man and worked so hard never got to play pro ball!"
4,review,This was a great movie and I like movies that star Dennis Quaid anyway. It is a terrific story and a good movie to watch
2,Not what I expected...!!,"As a true Susan Branch fan with every book, calendar, address book, etc she's ever published, I am so dissapointed with this new calendar. The format isn't the same as years past. I guess I'm not ready to change. This years edition is just one large picture per month. No cute sayings, doodles, recipes, etc. I like the older ones better...Susan please go back to the old format...that's what makes them ""you"".! I'll anxiously await next years!"
3,Not her best calendar,"I LOVE SUSAN BRANCH'S WORK, ESPECIALLY HER CALENDARS! Unfortunately this calendar was not as wonderful as her past calendars."
1,Quality of product not very good.,"Calendar is attached to larger cardboard. Before I even placed on magnetic board, the first 11 months became unglued. Leaving only December month on cardboard. Not very happy with quality of product. Won't order this type of calendar again. Thank you for reading my review."
5,Superb -- can't wait to see next year's edition!,"Nothing says ""home"" in my kitchen like Susan Branch's calendars. Like a good potato chip, it's hard to have just one -- buying multiple copies for gifts is a just a given for me, as it probably is for so many of her other fans.Susan's creativity touches not only my heart, but my friends' as well. We love to read over each month's quips and quotes. In a way, it's like us sharing a couple cups of coffee with the artist!Thanks, Susan, for giving from your heart...can't wait to see next year's edition!"
5,inspiration for the year,"I'm a long time fan of Susan Branch and happy to know that her calendar will be hanging on my wall 'come 2007. Each month brings something new to do or think about ~ whether a recipe one month or just a great quote to perk you up. Full of beautiful, colorful watercolors (Susan's flowers are especially wonderful) ~ and lots of inspiration. If you have an active family ~ check out her Family Planner"
5,Wonderful exploaration of Paranoia as a style,"Kantor himself is something of a psychological stylist as opposed to a dryly objective academeic, and high time someone took serious clinical psychology out of the beadle-ish false belief that good psychology shouldn't be entertaining. Kantor has a sense of humor, a blessed leavening for the somewhat grim study of paranoid typolgy. Paranoids are weirdly creative, often intuitive, and given to a richly unreal inner life. This book is rather like a ornithologist's companion for the pleasurable hobby of birdwatching, althougth we are on the lookout for a pair of noids, who are watching us intently from across the park with high powered binoculars. But seriously folks, Kantor will bring the academic works of Theodore Millon to life in a way that some other perfectionistic nitpickery just can't. If you're a noid watcher, and you realy want to spot a pair of noids in action and appreciate their plumage and subtler behavioral patterns, this is the book for you."
1,Hard to read,"This book is very hard to read. It is not for an average person, more for doctors and other professionals. The whole book is written in 'doctor's language'. I wouldn't recommend it. It's now just sitting on my shelf."
4,Tough Love,"This book makes for interesting reading but is not ideal for sufferers for several reasons. A large portion of the book is devoted to reckognizing the symptoms of paranoia in others. Second and more importantly, the book unconsciouly villainizes paranoids, the last thing a sufferer needs. What Kantor fails to observe is that sensitive people prone to emmotional extremes of a hostile nature, i.e. extreme anger, are also frequently excessively compassionate individuals. Reading about one defect after another, without the slightest mention of any redemptive qualities can be demoralizing and unconstructive."
3,you get what you pay for,i recently purchased this game. it was a little bigger than i thought i would be. there is no light on the game so i cannot play in the dark. there is no stylus pen to punch in the numbers easier like the one my sister has. other than that the game is good to bring where you are going except when its dark you need light to play.
1,No harm done,"Well I bought this for my mother-in-law who is hooked on Su Doku. I bought it just as a small token. The price was cheap and I thought why not?Well it is hard to see the screen. It is also a bit impractical in that if you realise that you got a number wrong 20 turns ago, you have to go and delete all the 20 turns you just spent time doing to get to it and amend it.The price was cheap, so I was not expecting anything fancy but to be honest I was disappointed with it.When I realise that I have gotten a number wrong I do not bother trying to find it, I just start a new game. But the fact that is is so hard to see the screen and find the curser is very annoying and in fact no one even bothers using it now. We just print out the sheets from the web and do it the old fashoned way with pen and paper on a clipboard.As I said, no harm done, it was a cheap thing anyhow."
1,su doku,"The screen, buttons, and cursor are so small that you have to have very good eyesight and small fingers. It gave me eyestrain and a headache each time I played it. After using it twice, I gave it away. I prefer the puzzles in magazines, etc."
4,Hand Held Sudoku,I was excited to see that there was an electronic hand held version of the Sudoku puzzle. I found the numbers to be rather small and finding where your curser is can be hard at times so I make sure I always leave it off in an empty space. The navigation arrows are a little touchy. You have to be pressing in the right place or sometimes you may think you are going left and the curser is going down.I enjoy having it and use it often but I am almost thinking I would rather have the paper version as this one doesn't allow you to make mistakes. For instance if you have a 6 already in that row and you try to put one somwhere else in that row it won't let you and part of the challenge is making mistakes that messes the whole puzzle up if not caught on time.
2,Micro Su Doku,The cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it.Makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments.Design issue could be fixed easily!
3,sudoku maniac,I am obsessed with sudoku. I found this screen to be a little small and I need the option to enter the small numbers for the different possibilities in each square which this one doesn't have. I let the kids play with it. I still use the newspaper.
3,Su DoKu Plus Hand Held Game Review,"it a fun addictive game, but this hand held version is a little difficult to control and doesn't always sense when u push the buttons."
1,0 stars if it was possible!,"I almost can't believe that I sat through this entire film. I also have low expectations when it comes to alien/sci-fi flicks, however, this one blew my frickin mind how horrible it was. The quality of the movie seemed like it was filmed in someone's basement with an old school 8mm camera. The aliens were terrible and kind of made no sense.I can't stress enough that nobody will like this movie, no one! I'm actually pissed I spent $1.10 at Redbox on this thing! I just keep thinking about the things I could have done during that wasted 2 hours of my life.Also, the dude from 'Boy Meets World' needs to get rid of his Justin Beiber haircut. I'm just saying."
3,darkening sky,I don't know what to say about this movie I only watched it once. I didn't fully grasp the content of this flick. To be fair I won't give a negative review I'll have to watch it again to make sense of it.
4,Everything I Need in a Phone,"I've owned many cell phones and this Nokia has convinced me that my next phone will be another Nokia. First of all, the features - in addition to the typical - camera, phone book, etc. - it has a fantastic software package developed by Nokia that allows you full access to transfer files, synchronize your contacts, calendar, tasks, etc. which combined with the fact that it can play MP3s and has space for an MMC storage card makes it an unbeatable value with excellent functionality! I can't help but recommened it for anyone who really wants and easy way to have a wealth of information at their fingertips - literally!"
1,CD-Rs from Document Records?,"This isn't about the CD's content but about it being a CD-R. Just purchased from a long time Amazon seller of the Document Records LTD titles but this is the first time I know of I've received a CD-R. I checked about 10 Document Records releases I had readily at hand and yeah this appears to be the case. I'm really unhappy about this not being disclosed. Someone, the seller or the manufacture is responsible for informing the buyer and this just isn't happening currently. This also just happen to me with Jazz Oracle from a different long time Amazon seller. So it appears to be the trend and definitely a very bad one for the consumer. FWIW."
1,Think twice on this one...,"I was thrilled with this product after the first day of using it! It's light duty, but perfect for the cleaning around the yard and washing the car, which is what I wanted it for. Unfortunately, the hose was kinked when I removed it from the box; I was concerned, but apparently not concerned enough. The second day of spraying down the patio, the hose burst in one of those kinks. The store I bought it from doesn't carry replacements hoses, and they aren't on the manufacture's website. Unfortunately, I can't say that I would recommend this product."
1,homeowner,"I bought this and was happy enough at first- used 3-4 times to wash a small (20x25 foot) deck and some brick steps. Did OK - hose connection to unit always leaked a little even with a washer. Went to use it this summer and cheap plastic handle had water gushing out where the trigger was- not cracked, - I'm guessing a seal leaks. Karcher has no customer service."
2,okay for awhile,"I bought a more expensive Karcher washer several years ago. It worked very well for about 6 months. It still works, but there is a leak in the trigger mechanism that makes the pump cycle on and off whenever you're not spraying. It's messy and aggravating.My father bought a similar unit a few months later, his pump quit after about 6 months of occasional use."
4,Dave,"Finally choose the model 245 at Lowe's for $108.00 because it was light and made in Germany. Wanted something I could pack up and take with me in a motor home. Used it today on my large deck to prep it for staining. It worked fine even though the sales people advise to get something larger. True the power cord does like to wrap itself around the hose, but the trade off is, it is so light and portable you can practically drag it around with you. The power was enough to clean between the planks and if not careful you could get down to the bare wood. I wasn't even using the attachment for maxium scoring. It also adjusts down and I plan on washing the car this afternoon with the lower setting. Can't tell how long it will last but talked to someone who has had one, 240 model, for 2 years and still going strong. We shall see."
4,Karcher K245 Electric Pressure Washer,"Compact easy to use. The pressure it creates is not that high. You won't blow the paint off your car or your house. It is good for cleaning duties like decks, walks, siding and cars. It has a hose to allow you to suck some soap into the unit and spray soapy water. If you need a spray unit to clean concrete buckets and really heavy duty stuff this is not your unit. If you are a home owner that needs basic power cleaning done this will do. Can't beat the price either. After rebate and new Chase Visa card offer it is like 20.00. Yeah."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this pressure washer and was happy for about a week. The hose pretty flimsy and will kink very easily. When it does the hose will bust. You can get a replacement for about $50 but I purchased the washer for $100. You can't use a normal replacement hose that you can find at a hardware store because the propriety connection of the hose to the wand (handle) will only fit the Karcher product. To get around this I had to purchase an entire new wand and hose (Heavy duty) for $50. Now I have spent $150 on a $100 unit. I should have done a little more research first, and then sprung $200 for an electric model with a standard hose and wand. I will never purchase this brand again and have talked several people out of buying one due to my issue."
3,"Great at ground level, not as well above head","The product cleaned the siding of the house great at and below head level, but when trying to clean above your head, the unit seemed to lose some of its ability.Great unit for it's price, though, and still well worth it."
1,Don`t waste your money,"I bought the k245, lasted one year with very little use then the pump blew apart! Then I bought the 520m (heavy duty) lasted alittle over a year and lost pressure! What a waste of money."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"The pressure washer gave out a burnt smell and quit working after only 20 minutes of operation, even after I followed the procedures exactly as the manual stated. I received no response from the manufacturer after trying to contact them. Save your money and buy from another manufacturer. I have to give it at least one star, because there's no option for no stars. A real piece of junk!!!"
4,Good low power pressure washer,"This pressure washer is not for those who want to take a layer of wood off their deck. For lightweight jobs it's perfect. Small size for easy storage, easy to put together and operate.I've used it on my vinyl fence, vinyl siding, and flower trellis and it does a nice job removing mold, mildew and dirt in general. Some mold that had been on my trellis for several years required detergent to breakdown, but overall an excellent buy."
5,Saber Marionette J DVD 2,"Saber Marionette is a light-hearted story about a guy and his adventures with his marionettes, or robot-like women. The plot is pretty original, and it's very funny. In this second DVD collection, The graphics are great. All anime should been made on DVD. It's a very colorfull series, that some say reminds them of Tenchi Muyo, but I feel it's much better. The characters are O'so lovable, and the series never gets old. If your looking for something a little less main-stream, this is definitly worth checking out."
5,The African Adventurers,"Excelent recount of great african hunters and adventurers, very well written and documented."
2,It's cheaper at Wal-Mart.,"I bought this item on Amazon because of the convenience. I like to do my own oil changes and I don't live anywhere near a Wal-Mart.When the box arrived, it was immediately apparent that one of the bottles was leaking. I decided not to return it and will probably never order again."
3,It does the job,"Mobil 1 synthetic oil will do the job. It is a good oil. I have used it for years and will use it again if I need to. I usually use Royal Purple which Is in my opinion, better and fantastic. The reason I give Mobil 1 three stars is because it is not exceptional. It just does it's job and does it well. No trick up it's sleeves and normally I'd give five stars for something I like and use that ""Just works"" however, and with engine oil, I'm a bit more reserved."
1,Couldn't Play the Game,"I bought this game for my daughter after she had been asking for it for quite some time. My computer doesn't meet all of the game's requirements.I'm running Windows XP Service Pack 2, Dell's XPS Media Center Edition, Pentium D CPU 2.80 GHz, 0.99 GB of RAM, with 109 GB of free space. I installed the game and when I tried to launch it, the error message ""Pixel Shader Unavailable"" appeared. After uninstalling it and reinstalling it, I did a search and found out that I have the wrong video card for this game.We have many games on our computer and have never encountered this problem before. Some of the games we have are: all of the Nancy Drew games, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, Delta Force, and Star Wars Battlefront to name a few.What started out as a joyous moment for my daughter, turned into heartache. I will not be handing over the money needed for a new video card just for this one game though."
1,High end Graphics card required,"This cheap program will not work on a cheap machine. In fact, you'll be hard pushed to find a computer with the high-end graphics requirement. My daughter was very upset. It not only didn't work on my dual processor laptop, it didn't work on my daughter's almost new computer nor on her friend's computer.I don't recommend this software. It should work on kids' computers, its a kids' game. However, THQ was good about letting me know what the problem was. However, Valusoft's website was totally non-functional."
1,Very fake,"I brought this thinking It was the real thing. But they LIE about what they selling. It DO come with Battery which was never told and the ""Just Shake To Charge"" is a FAKE! We even took it apart and IT need the 2 little battery to work. Don't ever buy these ""Everlife Flashlight"" because it a fake."
1,Beware,"As the previous reviews have said, these flashlights do not actually work. Myhusband opened them up but said that there is just no way for the product tocharge itself by shaking as intended. Let me clarify, when they arrived theylit up for 3 hours, except one that never worked; after that, they shined a dimnightlightish glow for a couple of minutes until the plastic eventually crackedand the parts fell off.Also, they apparently weigh 4 lbs... you do the math, b'c reviews shouldn'taddress this unspoken issue, just do the math! My box said 1 lb, they must usean ""everlife scale alternative"" to weigh the product."
1,waist of time flashlights,"Don't buy these, they don't even come to your house assembled. I bought one for my father for Christmas. It arrived competely disassembled! My father had to put it together himself. He says you have to vigurously shake it for 2 minutes to get a good light from it but it goes dim very fast after first minute and a half. Even if you keep doing it like the directions say, the normal battery operated flashlights are still better than these. I went through amazon and he got his in a week, I went through the main website to get my own and I've been waiting 2 and a half months (backorded). I'm expecting mine to come in pieces too apparently. My father says you cannot see beyond 8 feet with it and half that for the little one that normally comes with it. It's not worth the money for this product, it sucks."
2,EVERLIFE IS LITTLE LITE,"9 of 9 people found the following review helpful:EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005Reviewer: AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviewsLIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT."
3,"Not so bright, but handy.","These aren't ideal for lighting an area, as they are rather dim. However, I love having them on hand in case of an emergency, since it seems like the batteries are always missing or out of energy in my other flashlights. I liked it enough to buy some extras for stocking stuffers, but not well enough to make it my primary source of a flash light."
3,Not bad,"The wind up flash lights now reasonably priced and available everywhere are probably a better value long term, but these work."
2,So bad it's funny.,"These flashlights were carefully designed to be a ripoff. Using the same case and circuit board as quality shaking flashlights, the maker added a couple of new things: 2 batteries. Yup, this flashlight is actually a keychain light in disguise. The coil of wire is shorted out & the metal slug in the center isn't even magnetic.Good stocking stuffer for those who will get the joke."
4,Urban Excitement,"Morrell's Creepers is a delight. The story is fast paced and has many twists and turns to keep the reader interested. The hero, Frank Balenger, is a great character with the potential to be another Jack Reacher. He's tarnished and broken in many ways, but still the hero of the story and one you can really get behind.The concept is unique, from the perspective that urban exploration is not something discussed either by the news or other avenues. To see this side of life was really interesting. The thought of scouring long abandoned buildings to understand what life was like in the past is really thought provoking. Our history doesn't go back as far as other cultures, thus the need for an urban archeological perspective."
3,Ummm....no,"Went back and read this book again recently because I couldn't clearly recall much of it. Now I know why. Droll. Frank Balenger, our main character, starts out as an intriguing character that I was eager to get to know better. The fact that he is a former army ranger and Blackwater employee, made me want to delve into him even more. Until he is revealed to be a sniveling coward who basically watches as three thugs torment and attack him and his group of ""creepers"". Normally, when Morrell writes about former military people you can expect a whole lot of ass kicking and retribution. Not this time. Balenger comes across, to me, as an interesting character but, out of place in this story.The follow up novel to this, Scavengers, is a much better read, so I will chalk this one up as an anomaly."
4,Things that go bump--and worse--in the night,"David Morrell's Creepers is indeed creepy. Guy-with-a-secret-past Frank Balenger joins a foursome of urban rangers as they infiltrate a shuttered, turn-of-the-century hotel in New Jersey's Asbury Park. The Paragon Hotel--brainchild of long dead agoraphobic hemophiliac Morgan Carlisle--was glamorous in its prime. Now it's Miss Havisham's banquet hall writ large, rotted and rat infested, its floors collapsing, inhabited by things that go bump--and much, much worse--in its perpetual night. The hotel, though, harbors treasures within, not least of them the century of history that's played out in its rooms. Morrell's story is, shall we say, unlikely, maybe over the top. But it's certainly a page turner. Suspend disbelief for a while (I myself question the fire-quenching capacity of the principals' urine, which seems out of proportion to its volume) and you may enjoy it."
4,Spooky Fun!,"This was quite exciting! And certainly as creepy as the title suggested! The subject of urban exploration was unique and very interesting. This certainly would make a great movie, in my opinion. The plot had many twists and turns, make it just an adventurous book to read!"
2,"Intriguing Premise, Period.","The Paragon Hotel was built a hundred years ago by a wealthy, reclusive madman. Now a band of urban explorers will breach the long-shuttered ruin. Some seek adventure, others want treasure, and one man is looking for the truth.But once they're inside, they find they are not alone.Unfortunately, they start talking. If you enjoy hundreds of pages of mind-numbingly bad TV dialog, this book is for you. As a bonus, the action is predictable and repetitive.Creepers might have generated some suspense if the author had created interesting characters. But he only attempts to develop one of them, the journalist Frank Balenger, with clumsy and implausible results. The others, including villains, fall far short of the Bad TV standard.Hollywood should buy Creepers for the premise and junk everything else. Any randomly chosen screenwriter can write a better story.Wait for the movie."
4,First book in a long time I couldn't put down!,"There are plenty of long reviews, so I'll be brief. This book sat in my stack of books to read for well over a year, and after buying the sequel I figured it was time to pick it up...and I'm thrilled I did. This is one of the fastest reads I've seen in a long time. It was almost impossible to put down. Don't look for anything 'deep' as some of the author's other works tend to get, but this is a fun, rollercoaster page turner."
3,Creepers - almost there,"This was the first time I've read David Morrel, so I decided to get Creepers and Scavenger. I thought the story line was great, but the character developlment was alittle lacking. As I'm going through the book, Im constantly focused on the characters because there isn't much description of the events happening or much back story developlment and that might be the reason I'm being hypercritical. The end I felt the books rated 3 stars because the story ideas are good."
2,mediocre at best,"Standard ""B"" movie horror set up with the protagonist and a bunch of cardboard supporting characters that are destined to die one by one. Some very awkward dialogue and so-so writing. I read about halfway through, then flipped to the end, and yes, it ended just the way I had thought it would. A couple of okay thrills here and there. In fact as I read, the phrase ""cheap thrills"" kept popping into my head. Not worth the time, a disappointment. This from supposedly one of the greatest thriller writers or whatever. O-kay..."
2,"Fast read, but not much there...and too much talking!","The first 150 pages whiz by, but then I realized that there was an awful lot of talking going on.If YOU were held at gunpoint by some psychos who had already killed someone in your party, would you spend time casually giving your opinions about the history of the hotel you're in, the price of old gold coins, or discuss the best way to find a hidden vault?The chatter is what finally ground this book to a hault -- I think it was too long so there needed to be some talk to fill space. A fast read, but...really, ""anyone"" can do that. We want some story."
3,Needs Improvement,"David Morrell is an excelent writter, and Creepers was a well-thought out book with a very good premise. However, there were a few shortcomings. First, there was little character development other than the main character, and even he was a little static. Second, the whole layout of the hotel seemed confusing. Maybe a quick map could have been inserted on the front page. Third, the creepiness of the hotel dwindled about half-way through the book and became a ""hide from the bad guy in one location"" for the second half of the book.I owe these shortcomings to the shortness of the novel. Another 100-150 pages would have added more attention to detail and character development. Based on the quality of his writing, and not on the story alone, I would gladly pick up another book by Morrell."
4,A suspensful page-turner,"This is one of those rare books that I read cover-to-cover in a single sitting. Morell's prose is lean and sharp, but layered with the kind of atmosphere that left me practically smelling the mold and hearing the creaks of the old hotel in which this story is set.There are some occasional passages of exposition conveyed through dialogue that seemed a bit awkward in contrast with the otherwise fast-moving story, but I understand the necessity to communicate this information. Aside from these breaks, the pace is relentless. The story takes place over 8 hours, and can basically can be read in ""real time"". I'd definitely encourage you to make sure you have a solid 6-8 hours blocked out in your schedule once you get started. If you're like me, you're not going to want to put it down until you've finished.A good choice for fans of suspense and action fiction."
1,What a waste of time...,"This is a horribly written, utterly predictable, and incredibly stupid book. After reading the glowing reviews, I was prepared for a ""can't put it down, read it all in one sitting"" plot. Instead I found very poor writing with flat characters which is a shame because the overall idea had a lot of potential. I have my Master's Degree in English, and I read constantly - so my expert advice is - don't pick this one up because you'll want to put it right back down."
1,Will the real author please stand up?,"I await every new Morrell with anticipation. While for a change, I did not read this book; but, rather listened to the cd, I found it to be substandard at best.Not only was the story boring but I found it to be totally implausible. I could not identity with a single character. It mattered not at all whether any one of them survived -- usually I find myself totally immersed in at least one of Morrell's charaters.I couln't wait for the book to end. Furhtermore, I did not care at all for the narrator. Sorry, but this was a huge disappointment."
1,omg make it stop,"The publisher sent me a copy of this book to review because I run an urban exploration website. I knew the author and hoped for the best - but got the worst. My advice: read all the 1 and 2 star reviews on here, and believe them. Was terrible, terrible, terrible. I still want to know how a guy with his wrists duct-taped together can slap a hysterical woman, though."
4,Recommended,"Enjoyed the abridged CD set, if not especially the voices of the reader. Even in the abridged version some things were a bit repetitive, but the story was strong and the suspense didn't let up once it started."
2,Will make a better movie...,The first 175 pages really were quick but then the descriptions of the different floors and layout of the hotel easily became lost. I had no overall sense of any layout once they moved beyond the 2nd floor. This definately detracted from the book since so much of the later part of the book really focuses on where the bad guy is in relation to the good guys. Too bad. That's why I think this will make a better movie -- but only if marketed as a thriller versus horror.
2,not what I expected,"This novel had an interesting premise and was off to an exciting start but it quickly became a mess. The author tried to do too many things with it and the plot suffered. Was it a ghost story, a serial killer novel, a thriller? I'm not sure what it was but it failed at all levels."
5,Elevated Horror!,"This is a breathless and illuminating tale from one of my favorite thriller writers! Have you ever heard of the urban cult of explorers called ""Creepers""? I was completely unaware that there were groups of explorers all over the world whose joint adventure is about exploring abandoned city buildings. It's true! Also called ""City Speleologists"", these urban adventurers outfit themselves with caving gear and explore empty buildings in cities all over the world! They often break into buildings illicitly, but all they take with them when they leave are photographs. When US Army Ranger and Iraqi war veteran Frank Balenger pretends to be a journalist and joins a group of Creepers, he enters the long-deserted Paragon Hotel and finds that he and his companions are not the only prowlers in the house. This is a fast paced nerve-jangler that will thrill mystery and horror buffs everywhere."
3,Sounded spooky...just not sure it filled the bill,"There were some good parts to this story. The spooky setting, the lore, the sense of insanity all added to the mystery and tension. However, it was just too unbelievable. Characters enter in the middle of the story that hardly make any sense. The main protagonist's story is, however, very interesting and there is some real suspense as to his actions and thinking. I found the ending anti-climatic and unsatisfactory (I won't give it away). I respect those who have read other works by this author and suspect that his writing simply is not my ""cup of tea."""
3,Quite enjoyable but....,This is the first book that I have read from this author and I found it to be somewhat suspenseful. The premise of entering abandoned buildings may appeal to some but not me. The are a few tense moments but the whole thing reminded me of one of those 1970 ABC Movies of the Week. And the ending kind of fizzled. I will read more from this author but I don't think that this would be a good starting point for some new readers.
3,Great idea for a movie,"The idea of writing a suspense novel in which the main characters are urban explorers was great and the setting of the novel (an old, abandoned hotel full of secret stories) was also perfect. However, the author included a lot of overcomplicated floor plant descriptions and underdelivered in the outcome of the story. Given all the sinister/creepy elements that he added along the way, I was expecting a more creative plot and outcome. Nonetheless, this book would make a very good movie."
3,Close but no Cigar,"Creepers is a fun and drawing novel how ever it lacks the detail needed to make you really appreciate the surroundings. it takes place over 8 hours but you constantly find yourself wishing for more details. the writing is a little jumpy and at times seems as if written as a high school project. i don't want the book to sound bad, but it was quite short (2 hours) but it was still a very interesting book right down to the feelings of the characters. i recommend it if your one who doesn't look for riveting detail and only a broad coverage of facts and events."
2,Led to believe something else.....,"Another reviewer mentioned the blurb on the back of this book, and that it didn't accurately reflect the real story. I thought this book was going to be some kind of ""monster in the closet"" thriller. Instead it turned out to be an testosterone-driven, urban-cave-exploring, Rambo-lovin', bore.So, I'm still trying to figure out why they threw in the five-legged cat?!?!?"
2,Very dissapointed,"After just reading several Dean Koontz books in a row.I bought this book based on the description of a real thriller.Yes it was a page turner,kept me reading,and reading,and on the edge of my seat sort of.I thought the book was quite predictable.The ending was a big let down after the thriller pace of the book.I read lots of Thrillers,Murder mysteries,etc....I was not impressed with the authors writing style,the plot.The only thing I found super interesting was the location of the book in Asbury Park NJ where I grew up near.Save your money,buy Dean Koontz :The Face Instead"
3,What a great premise but....,"it just didn't deliver. I liked the concept, the description of the building (should have fleshed that out a bit more) but it just didn't keep me. Plus, it was very short for the 25 bucks. Three stars for the idea and the mutated rats."
3,Not his best work,"I've been a fan of David Morrell's work for years, and was eagerly awaiting this book. I have to admit I was disappointed. I'm not sure he knew where he wanted to go with this book. Starts out as a mystery/horror then switches to a crime drama, and then an action piece. The pace never quite maintained any momentum, and I was disappointed."
2,"Beginning was great, but...","Warning- this review may contain spoilers...The beginning of this book was terrific. I couldn't put it down. Then to my disappointment several other characters were introduced, and the whole thing just degenerated into a bad comic book-ish story with cardboard, clichéd characters and events and idiotic dialogue.There was no reason for it. He had me hooked on the story as it was, with the huge creepy old hotel and the mutant animals. When things started to collapse in the hotel, it became a survival story. The author should have left well enough alone, because the story was good enough at that point to stand on it's own.I gave it 2 stars because the beginning was so good. The rest- very disappointing."
1,Worst Morrel novel I've ever read!,"I've been a longtime fan of Morrel's work, going all the way back to the spy stories ""Brotherhood of the Rose"", ""Fraternity of the Stone"", etc. I haven't read any books of his since ""The Protector"". I picked up ""Creepers"" at a used book store and even though I paid half price for it, I feel utterly ripped off. I stopped reading it at the 2/3rds point because it just continued to degrade in quality.This book is the literary equivalent of a Sci Fi channel movie. Cardboard characters, extremely hokey plotline with dumb twist after dumb twist tossed in that didn't make any sense. If this book were to be made into a movie, you would have some hackneyed ham like M. Night Shyamalan directing. Its that bad. Morrel, in the past, always seemed like a pretty talented writer with a good spin and narrative and there is none of that in this book at all. For shame, Dave, for shame!"
2,Disappointing.,"It was good at the beginning and a real disappoinment on the second half. At the end many things were left unexplained. I anticipated a scarier ending that never came. I could have come up with a better idea for the 2nd half. This is my first David Morrell's, probably the last. I liked Rambo the movie though."
2,"Great premise, but...","The idea of a thriller based on urban exploration of abandoned buildings is an excellent one. The novel starts out well, with compelling characters and setting. By midway through, however, there were so many unlikely plot turns that the story lost all its credibility for me. I wanted to like the book, but I didn't."
4,4 1/2 stars,"I'll agree that this is one of David Morrell's better novels. He packs quite a bit of suspense and action into these pages and the adrenaline never seems to let up. I must admit though, at times, I couldn't quite clearly visualize the layout of the hotel and its many secret areas/stairwells. You could say that sometimes I got a little lost. Oh well, it was still great entertainment.Recommended"
1,"Audio Version - not exciting, no suspense, lackluster story.","Like other reviewers, I am a big fan of Morrell's earlier works. On a long car trip, I listened to the audio version of Creepers. It just did not play well as an audio book. It didn't help that the reader made a trio of supposedly menacing bad guys sound like the Three Stooges.Not all of the blame is the reader's, however. Morrell's story was pretty flat. No character development. His author's note at the end was more interesting than the book.To be fair, the clerk told me that many of his customers really liked the audio version of this book. Maybe it was just me."
5,Morrell is simply the best!,"I couldn't put this book down. There were so many twists and turns that I was completely engrossed. 5 urban explorers, Creepers, enter the Paragon Hotel and instead of the abandoned building they hope to find, they find instead that the hotel is inhabited by more than ghosts from the past. This book is a must read for David Morrell fans. A good mix of horror, thriller and action. Something for everyone in this book. One of his best."
1,"""Unauthorized Charger""","This charger does not work for the Motorola W385. When it is plugged into my Motorola W385, the following error message displays on the phone: ""Unauthorized Charger""."
3,Ok,"I thought it was original from motorola since the picture indicated the logo. However, when it came, it was just a random brand. It works fine."
5,Perfect!,Works like a charm and very affordable! Couldn't be more pleased with the phone charger. I recommend this product and seller to anyone looking for a replacement phone charger.
1,This video lacks nearly half an hour of the film.,"Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits is a major film, brilliant both technically and in terms of its rich content. Nearly half an hour of the film is, however, missing in this video version. It appears to have been made from a print from which some collector had earlier pruned his or her favorite parts, two entire scenes and numerous small bits (mainly those with hints of nudity). What a shame. I only wish Criterion would get the rights to this film and do a video and DVD worthy of it."
5,One of Fellini's best films,"I started watching Fellini films as a young teen, seeing the older ones in the revival theatres, and eagerly anticipating his newest films. Juliet of the Spirits is truly my favorite Fellini film. The camera visuals and color are stunning. The wide screen format is imperative. I only wish that Criterion had also added the (bad) English language soundtrack. It's better for first time viewers. Some of Fellini's imagery is easily missed by reading too many subtitles."
4,Juliet of the Spirits (1965) - Federico Fellini,"Juliet of the Spirits is a film that contains such lush colors, such nice cinematography, and enough visual, dreamlike imagery that it's a shame it all covers a rather emotionally shallow interior. The film has too much of a whimsical feel to it to really cut deep into the human psyche, but often times Fellini fills the screen with such nice imagery that you can excuse most of the film's shortcomings. Similar to 8 1/2 (1963), but from a woman's standpoint, Juliet of the Spirits is mostly an interesting experimentation in color and image because Fellini has a hard time finding the emotional core that makes his best films work so well. Still, Juliet of the Spirits is enjoyable, especially to look at, and there are a few scenes that will leave you in awe."
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!!!!,"One of the maestro's best. BUT, a terrible copy. For some reason on two tapes and the continuity between them is ineptly edited -- in midscene yet. Dumb. Most importantly, subtitles are usually impossible to read, given the generous amount of dazzling white that Fellini used in many of the scenes, for obvious reasons.Avoid this version!"
2,Like a Ton of Bricks,"After ""81/2,"" Fellini came apart as an artist. And how have the mighty fallen! Nowhere in film is there a comparable example of an artist at the absolute height of his powers suddenly falling so short of everyone's expectations. ""Juliet of the Spirits"" happens to be not merely an artistic failure - it reveals a moral failure in Fellini. Hereafter, his films would become inexcusably more and more self-indulgent. The filmmaker who made ""The White Sheik"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" left us so suddenly. Fellini may as well have been run over by a lorry."
1,WARNING,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. It is cut by over 10 minuts. Do not support this kind of bad realeses. It is a pity for the film is really very god and is worth a better destiny than this. To Image Entertainment: DO NOT CUT MOVIES.
4,"Excellent Film, Fair Fellini","How can one resist the smile and acting of Giulietta Masina together with the imagination of her husband/director Federico Fellini? If you have never seen this team in action, I suggest you begin with ""La Strada,"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" before diving into the more surreal worlds of this film, ""8 1/2"" or even ""La Dolce Vita.""Not lacking in several of the thematic and cinematic Fellini trademarks such as a creepy, confused lead male; the circus; the road/mind trip; the spirituality vs. religion strain; and the huge heart of teeny-weeny Masina, ""Juliet Of The Spirits"" will set you thinking and reaching for the rewind button on your VCR.Is this a good first choice for Fellini virgins? I'd say not, as other films (mentioned above) can warm you up to the Fellini style while the pathos is also better presented and sustained elsewhere.If you'd genuinely like to have your heart broken, see two of the three best films ever acted/presented: ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria."""
3,"good picture quality, terrible sound!","I buy the Criterion's DVD of ""Giulietta degli spiriti"". Fantastic colors, no cuts, finally a good restoration of this famous movie. But the sound! The sound in this movie it is very important, because it supports many of the ""sensations"" given by the pictures. The sound was totally not restorad, it was simply cleaned, and it is MONO too... I have an old italian (6 years old) VHS tape of this film, but it is in full stero hi fi and it sounds much better than the DVD. In some parts of the movie, especially where the sound is high, the sound turn to a ""noise"", obbliging to ""turn down"" the volume knob. The original italian language seems to come from a telefon unit... Why they did not restore the sound? I dont really understand. Was it so heavy to elaborate stero digital sound? My opinion: fantastic DVD pictures with old 8 tracks sound. Ciao from Southern Switzerland."
4,Not bad for Price,"Able to charge and plug earpiece in with phone in clip. Clip is sturdy with few breakable pieces. Only bad thing about is clip protrudes out too far and rubs your skin raw, you have to move it around frequently to prevent from hurting yourself."
4,Like the band,I like the band. It is hard to find nice white watch bands for summer wear. Also the face is large enough to easily read. I like it.
3,Just a bit disappointed,"IMO when I tried it on, the watch seemed to fit irregular meaning not centered properly when I put it own and I have an average size wrist. Then after a few days, the white pretty band started looking more off white and so I looked to check out the so called leather and it seemed to be more pleather on the outside and a small strip of leather glued on the inside. I like the indiglo light when I want to see the time at night. Otherthan keeping decent time, the value seems more like a $12 than a $22 watch IMO. I got it as a nurse watch but I would probably want to see the watch in person if I had to shop all over again. It was free through a survey I took, so no money lost."
3,Good music. Repetitive though.,"This album has good tracks, however my biggest gripe is that many of them sound repetitive in theme and even melodies. I was looking for more variety."
3,Don't buy just because you like Buddha Bar,"This CD is sometimes compared to Claude Challe's excellent Buddha Bar series. This is misleading. Although the CD is nice, it may seem like trite ""world music"" in comparison to Claude Challe's multilayered creations. For example, track 2 ""Cantamilla"" by Tranquility Bass is very similar to track 10 ""Cantamilla"" also by Tranquility Bass on Challe's ""Flying Carpet Lotus."" However, the Claude Challe version is much more interesting. Such comparison holds true for all tracks on Arabesque."
5,North African Funk,"For all those fans of the swirls of North African music, here's something traditional but also brings the balance of driving bass lines. The tenor of the traditional sound is broadened and given a contemporary feel by the pounding rhythm. Great in the car on a roadie with some friends - really transports you in time and space."
3,Does anyone know if any of Heath Ledger's eps?,Does anyone know if any of Heath Ledger's episodes are in this set?They're rare and pretty hard to find.Thanks in advance.
5,Perfect,"Needed to replace a scissor-style latch. This latch does exactly what I need and was easy to install. I really like that it's able to be installed, and works perfectly, reversed from the picture."
3,"Decent hardware, requires care.","This gate hardware is very nice but has aged a little faster than I anticipated. The finish chipped off of the places where the pieces strike each other, but there is no major rust yet (after about 3 years of use). It does require lubrication to maintain maximum function. I use a dry teflon-based lube so I don't stain the cedar fence. Overall, this is a good set for the money. Pair this latch set with adjustable hinges to make sure that the bar will strike in the center of the latch or the brass hinge pin on the latch will bend. Not an insurmountable problem (especially for the cost) but something you should know."
3,A certain charm....,"This so-called parody of horror films is so awful that it has a certain awful-movie charm. The awfulness is the story itself (and it is really raunchy, too). But the actual actors soldiered on and did a good job for this piece of nonsense.I also think the writer/director did exactly what he set out to do. This isn't awful by accident, but the whole thing is just one big silly spoof.If you have a halloween party, and don't mind the R-rated parts, this silly movie might be just the thing. This is the story of Stan Helsing, a young man who works at a shlockbuster video store, who sets out with his friends to find a party on halloween. As they travel to the owner of the store's house to drop of videos, they meet every stock character from horror movies that you can think of.If you enjoy this kind of utter stupid nonsense, go for it."
1,Stupid and Laughless....,"If I could go lower than one star, I would....I had rock-bottom expectations for this movie, especially given it's dubious pedigree, but I was STILL disappointed.....Bad acting, bad dialogue, the ubiquitous Leslie Nielson appearance that's de rigeur for any lifeless spoof.....The idea is fun, but the execution is deadly dull.Avoid! Save yourself...it's too late for me!"
3,about the soundtrack,"the movie was entertaining because i didn't expect a blockbuster. it was funny n a dark humor way. but my MAIN interest is the end credit songs, there were (2). i want 2 know what was the first one, i know the second one was"" Touch my body"", but i REALLY like the one b4 it. it was played during the end credits. HELP!!"
2,I tried,"I tried. I really tried to watch this movie, but just couldn't make it.It's not that the movie is that bad--I wasn't expecting high art--it's that I kept getting hopelessly distracted by the clumsy presentation. There would be, for example, a scene with four characters having a conversation. The four characters lined up in a row, clearly staying strictly on their marks, unmoving, reciting their lines. Clumsy and unnatural. It was stage sit-com style missing 4th wall shooting rather than film style. Odd and very distracting. Just one example but things like this completely took me out of any storyline that might be taking place."
1,Been there done that (but others have done it better),"Very very silly movie. Received this as part of the Amazon Vine program, so glad I didn't waste any money on this. At first, I thought I didn't like it as I am in my 50's and maybe it was meant for 'younger' humor tastes. However, I tried to share this with my 24 year old son who told me he had seen it in the movies and would never be able to sit through it again (lol). Anyway, Stan Helsing seems to combine all the bad qualities of the Not Another Teen Movie genre films into a not funny spoof on horror movies. Save your money, and don't purchase this movie. Wait for it to come on network television. Just terrible."
5,funny,funny goofy movie laugh through the whole thing watched it over and over to plain old good funny movie haha
5,Adult Funny,"This movie has a lot of adult humor! The four main characters, including Stan Helsing, are trying to make a video delivery and get to a Halloween party. They get stuck in a town that believes Stan Helsing is there to save them from the horrors. Funny to watch. Leslie Nielson plays a waitress...hysterical."
1,Nothing worth watching in this horror spoof,"I knew this was going to be a bad movie when, about ten minutes in, there was a very extended scene in a van that just dragged and dragged. I could identify the one liners that were supposed to be funny, but they weren't.From Bo Zenga, a guy who can claim to have had something to do with Scary Movie, Van Helsing is a horror spoof that brings characters in from every horror movie imaginable. The low budget has something to do with the poor quality. But the movie is full of bad pacing and poor jokes. Leslie Nielsen makes a mockery of himself playing a character in drag. What was he thinking?About the only positive is the characters. They play it straight, which is a must for these types of movies. Unfortunately, nothing else works."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"First, let me say that I LOVE stupid, juvenile, slapstick humor. Just for reference, I've thoroughly enjoyed such movies as the 'Scary Movie' franchise, 'Vampires Suck', 'Meet the Spartans', etc - some pretty dumb, but funny humor there. There aren't too many comedies, especially spoofs that I haven't at least CHUCKLED at. Stan Helsing did not even make me smile. It was so bad it actually made me angry for having wasted my time watching it. Absolutely NOTHING in this movie is funny. Not even remotely. The ONLY and I mean ONLY remotely 'interesting' element of this movie were the hot actresses. I honestly don't understand how anyone could rate this movie more than one star. I'd give it zero stars if it were possible. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this movie - even if you can watch it for free. It's not worth your time, let alone your money."
1,Terrible movie in terrible condition,"Terrible movie in terrible condition. This DVD was the worst condition I have ever seen one in, and did not play right. Kept stopping. Would return it , but the person I gave it to tossed it."
3,Was Ok,"This movie was okay, but I have definitely seen better as far as these kinds of movies are concerned. It had some pretty funny parts, (I had a good laugh at the monster karaoke at the end). Not to mention this was one of Lesley Nielson's last films, so that gives it a little cred too. Overall, I'd say it's probably a good one time watch but probably not much more."
2,"PLEASE, rent it before you buy it","My advice is to rent it before you buy it. There are some funny moments, but the plot just doesn't keep it moving.I thought a spoof of several famous horror movies sounded like fun.The characters were good, and the acting very good for typical horror movie genre, but I wish it had more of a story to follow. Oh well, many horror films don't stick to the story very closely, so I guess it was appropriate to get a little distracted now and then.Leslie Nielsen in drag as Kay the waitress was funny, but probably especially because I like Nielsen. (Was he also spoofing TV soap opera's Kay Chancellor of the Young and the Restless?It's not going to be one of the great movies you'll remember forever, but for a Halloween party it might just be a hoot."
1,Horribly Unfunny and Insultingly Dumb,"I hope I've led a good life, I've tried to be kind to people, I give to charity, help my fellow man when they are down, and in general have a ""live and let live policy"".So why, just why was ""Stan Helsing"" thrown into my life? What crimes could one man commit that ""Stan Helsing"" would be visited upon him?If the ""Scary Movie"" series of films wasn't enough for you, ""Stan Helsing"" is like a compilation of the unfunniest scenes from those films.I'm actually angry at the space this dvd took up in my trash bag when I threw it out. That space could have been used for something that was useful at one time, like a spent tube of toothpaste or something. ""Stan Helsing"" doesn't even make good garbage. Don't even use this DVD as a coster, your drink will resent you.I hated this movie, and am a worse person for watching it."
1,Put a stake in it..,"There's ""Scary Movie"" and then there's this. Gawdawful parody of about every horror movie you've ever seen, with the accent on ""Van Helsing"", which was pretty terrible to begin with. The humor level is about that of a five year old laughing maniacally and inexplicably after having said ""poop"";I want the time back."
2,"Great Video and Audio, Lousy Movie","Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.This is a review of the Blu-Ray. The video was very good, almost excellent (I thought some fine detail was missing). I would rate it 9.5/10.The audio was Dolby Digital 5.1. There was also PCM 5.1. No Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio.I didn't think the movie was very good at all. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1,Barely Watchable,"I have been a fan of the Scary Movie franchise and it's spin-offs for years. Stan Helsing is the first one out of them all that I did not enjoy. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is not well written.. It feels like a bunch of random horror movie scenes connected together with no sort of forward story progression, even for a ""Scary Movie"" type film. Diora Baird's appearance was the ONLY thing that made this 108 minutes tick by for me. I would recommend those that enjoyed the Scary Movie's steer clear of this film as it does not have the same charm or humor as the others."
3,Better then I thought it would be,"Stan is not pulling his weight as a hero/monster killer and now he has to face who he is and deal with a group of monsters. I like this movie and feel guilty for it, this is one of those movies I want to watch over again just to see if it is really as dumb as I think it is.The four main characters are good and really ham it up, it's just a shame they did not have more of a story to work with. This is like watching Scooby Doo live action adult version. Honestly I wish it was Unrated so it could be even raunchier."
1,LESLIE SINKS TO NEW LOW,"Even spoof king Leslie Nielsen can't save this miserably unfunny parody of horror movies. Attempts at humor mainly focus on body functions and sexual stupidities. The acting is atrocious and the production values feeble.Making good spoofs is hard work but can be done, e.g. SCARY MOVIE, AIRPLANE. STAN HELSING fails for two main reasons: it's not funny and it's boring!"
1,Shooting Parody in a Barrel,"Wow, Leslie Nielsen and Keenan Thompson, fire your agents. Bo Zenga, retire. Everyone involved in this, hang your head. ""Stan Helsing"" is a spoof that can't take an easy target (monster movies and characters that have been around long enough to be self-parodies) and make even a mildly funny movie. I got only one mild chuckle in the whole 90 minutes of this film, and it involved a kids' hockey team. The rest of ""Stan Helsing"" is a wretchedly unfunny movie that misses almost every pitch it makes. Top it off with a bad Michael Jackson joke and an inexplicable ""appearance"" by Barack Obama and you start to wonder how this DVD got past the discussion stage. Plenty of aimless, mean-spirited sex jokes, a nasty homophobic streak, lack of developed ideas...and the only monster that stoner/video store clerk Stan Helsing should have killed off was this script."
1,Not even a goofy Nielsen can save this.,"I should have known better, as even the Scary Movie franchise ran out of steam really fast. This is a real snooze. They try so hard to make you believe it's funny, that it's almost painful to watch at times. Take a big pass on this."
1,Bad version of Scary Movie,"This is a parody type film about a guy named Stan Helsing who works in a videostore, goes to find a party with a couple friends and encounters a variety of horror movie villains along the way, such as Pinhead, Chucky, Micheal Myers, etc.. now Stans on a mission to save his town from the monsters.No good acting, not funny and slapstick humor at it's worst. If you want to watch a bad movie then get it. If not don't bother. It's not a good spoof or a good movie."
1,This one makes the other parody films look like works of art,"My title says it all. I didn't expect anything more than the below average quality of the Scary Movie franchise, but Stan Helsing sinks to new lows. I thought the idea of having the six (Freddy, Pinhead, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface and Chucky) most famous modern movie monsters was a good idea, but they are only in a handful of scenes and those scenes, like the rest of the movie, stinks. The writing and acting are horrible. I will admit that the ditzy blonde and a few other parts were a little amusing, but if that's all you get in a 90 minute ""comedy"" then why bother watching it? Having one of the main girls half dressed the entire movie helped me get through it, but just barely. Steer clear of this one."
1,Inventory Issues,"Occassionaly Amazon leads you to believe a product is in stock, your order it, and low and behold the vendor does not have it. If you independantly check the vendor's website they show no inventory. This happened to me here, the system still thinks I placed and order and it was filled, very frustrating."
4,A story of technology gone haywire.,"A good read about a world that has reverted in technology due to our race ahead of ourselves. When man reaches to far and something goes wrong and the innocent are blamed for the failure. The book shows how mankind must revert so as to survive in the future world, and one mans quest to find out the truth and punish the man everyone blames. He ends up finding out that what is told in history depends on who is doing the telling."
2,Had to Return,"These run very small. Daughter was wearing a 6, purchased a 7, and they were still too snug."
2,Not the best,"Nothing to see here, move on, these aren't the droids you are looking for. Just such simple explanations that it may work for high school, but at college level, it didn't add much. The narration was strong, but the subject matters weak and not fleshed out. Oh, maybe I shouldn't say ""fleshed out"" when talking bout rites of death... LOL"
5,The second best book ever!,"The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy is one of the best books I have ever read.The way Adams explains the scientific nature of the charachters abilities and equipment in a wackey but relitively possible way makes it amazing. However, the ending just lets you down. I mean you have an energetic and exciting bok with a boring ending. But, I have heard his explanation and can forgive him. Its the second best book ever!"
2,"Introduction to the Practice of Statistics, 4th Edition (Book & CD-ROM)",Did not have CDROM but other than that the book was in fair condition for the price. Needed the CDROM for this class though.
5,Good intro stats book,"I liked this book. Its very easy to read, and covers everything you need to know about basic stats.Buy it used!"
5,Introduction To The Practice of Statistics,"I am very happy with this book, I needed it for a class. The price was much cheaper than the bookstore at school and it was in excellent condition"
3,didn't stick as well as it could.,"I installed a 10 foot strip where my back splash hits my counter top at 90 degrees. I sanded and prepared surfaces per instructions because I had read some reviews about it peeling back on some surfaces, It didn't stick good enough. I think I had the wrong surfaces for it to bond properly (the counter top was pre-made MDF with a Formica like surface but not quite as smooth). I applied a new bead of caulking and let it almost set up to get it to stay in place. Have sealant or glue ready in case you have similar problems."
3,Not as good as the original,"This travel mug is meant to be an upgrade from the original Timolino Signature Vacuum Travel Tumbler (16oz), which had a flat lid whose sliding sip-hole cover did not detach, making it hard to clean. While this version 2.0 fixes the cleaning problem by making the cover able to be unclipped, they unfortunately added extra plastic by creating a big lip on the lid, making it more like the other mugs and hard to sip without hitting your nose (the absence of this in version 1.0 was in my opinion once of its best features). Additionally they have added unneccessary extra black plastic to the handle and surrounding areas, making the entire mug too top-heavy and less easy to drink from (additionally it is no longer able to be taken for a bike ride in a handle-bar cup-holder, as it falls out every time you go over a bump, unlike the original). Hopefully version 3 will be just like version 1, with the exception of an unclippable hole-cover."
4,Staying Alive,"Though not the original members of the family Pop R&B group in the 80's. This is a fun sampling of the groups hits sung by the younger brothers and sisters who assumed the reigns in the late 90s. Performed live at the 4th of July Celebration at Fort Dix New Jersey in 2006. There are some hot dance grooves on this CD, ""Oh Baby"" and "" Dance, Dance, Dance "". Check it out!"
3,"Fun, and Fanservice For All","After winning the war, the Juda Corporation doesn't have much to do, but they keep themselves busy. The 1st episode of this OVA follows Rachel around and gives you some insight into what she does in her free time. It's kind of pointless. I think the point was to see Miu exercising, and Emi getting her hair done.In the 2nd episode, Juda headquarters has been turned into a resort/spa. All the members of the team work there and remain on standby in case some trouble pops up. This episode was mainly focused on the fanservice aspect. For a while I thought that Kouichi and Emi would finally confess, get it on, or something like that. They didn't. Instead, Linebarrel clones appeared and started attacking. As you can probably guess, our heroes put them down. I enjoyed this short OVA, but I really think that they should have just added it on the end of season 2."
1,Keep looking...,"Got my case... first of all it's not ALL leather - it's leather wrapped around fitted plastic. Cool concept, but not what I expected (nor what was described). Despite what another reviewer indicated - the case doesn't come with a beltclip. It is bulky, unpractical, and quite frankly not worth it, unless all you need the case for is to protect the screen while the phone sits in your purse. The magnetic close is positioned right over the memory expansion slot... computer 101 - memory chips and magnets should not be in the same place. Good news... BoxWave Customer Support was great on the exchange and return. Unfortunately, they only operate via email, and are a bit slow in responding. However, they sent me a postage-paid mailing lable for the return, and it was relatively painless otherwise. My recomendation... keep looking for a leather case, this one isn't worth it."
5,Excellent lessons,I love the way Steve goes through the systematic lessons. I love the way how the arrangements are made with regard to the learning process.
1,Stay away! Stay away!,"This software sets up a virtual CD/DVD drive on your computer rendering your original CD/DVD drive useless unless you have the software running. Your computer will crash if you put a CD or a DVD in the original drive.This software is BAD, BAD, BAD!!!!!"
4,Bo Weavil Stands Out,"This album contains the complete recordings of Bo Weavil Jackson, which is reason enough to purchase this great cd. Not much is known about Bo Weavil. In fact, we don't even know his real name. However, he produced some of the greatest acoustic country blues that I've ever heard. Eleven out of the thirteen of his complete recordings range from great to masterpiece. Only ""...Kingdom Land"" and ""Why Do You Moan?"" are average songs. Bobby Grant's ""Nappy Head Blues"" is an essential piece of pre-war blues music. Lane Hardin has a nice and clear voice, and some pretty guitar work. King Solomon Hill's second take of his ""Whoopee Blues"" is quite awesome. This is a 4 star cd that you should pick up!"
3,"Good idea, poor execution","The idea behind this tool is great. I'm not fond of dipping getting my hand covered in hot oil, or having to fish the drain plug out of a hot oil bath. The magnet is a great feature.The tool's fit and finish are excellent. The lettering is easily readable. The polished surfaces are shiny.The end of the tool is too shallow, in my opinion. It doesn't leave very much room to grip the bolt, so make sure that it is on straight. Also, on my car, there wasn't enough space for the knurled knob so I wasn't able to use the socket at all. If Gear Wrench would add an inch or so to the end of the tool then it would work just fine."
2,House of Blood,"I found this dvd hiding away in my garage. I read the synposis and was wondering why I havent checked it out yet. Well the first 40 minutes are beyond horrible. I swear but when someone swears every sentence I get annoyed. Anyways, after forty minutes we see some good gore action. Enjoy it because it switches to more talking for anther half an hour before anymore gore is seen. House of Blood is decent and you can probably find it for cheap. Not a bad movie but not if your looking for consistent gore."
3,house of blood,some people will give this film 2 stars.i give it three because i loved the make up effects and im a horror fan. even though it has sceens of being repeted its a good film to watch if you like low budget films.
1,Abysmally bad!,"I don't even know what to say. The actors are horrendous, the script is laughable and the effects are subpar, oh yeah, the photography is lousy too. Nuff said."
3,"A digitally remastered compilation,not completely essential","Well apart from its packaging, this CD contains the memorable ""A song for all seasons"" and other pearls, such as ""Can you hear me"", ""Can you understand"", ""Running hard"" ... the rest is more pop oriented, but quite good, even if this isn't completely essential...I prefer the BBC live session or the mythical ""Live at the Carnagie Hall"",to have resumed some of the whole best stuff of their career. Anyway this CD could be an easy start concerning the Renaissance's history, if you don't know this fantastic band very much ...otherwise buy soon ""Turn of the cards"", ""Scheherazade"", ""Novella"", ""Ashes are burning"" and "" A song for all seasons"", even if this latter begins to turn to pop (except on the mythical title track and on ""Opening out"" too)Recommended, even if not completely essential ..."
4,Agree with previous review,The music is great but the packaging is disappointing. It tells you nothing about these live performances. Makes me wish for remastered editions of their previous works.
1,Sees intercession as a gift,"Mrs Jacobs has done a disservice to the body of Christ with this book and many have purchased it and refert to it as if it were cannonized scriptureIntercession is NOT a gift for a few, it is the required Christian discipline of ALL! 1 Timothy 2:1, 2:8Better books on this subject are Frank Damazio's ""seasons of intercession"" and Dutch Sheet's ""intecessory prayer"" among others"
5,Great book for those going deeper in intercession.,"Cindy's book is a wealth of information on prayer and intercession. It covers everything from the call to intercede to conducting ""spiritual mapping"" and praying to break strongholds over your city. This book is a definite for intercessors, as well for pastors and other spiritual leaders to understand the depth involved in spiritual warfare."
5,Awesome for Intercessors,"This book really opens your eyes and introduces one to the realm of intercession. It is straightforward, simple, and well-put-together."
4,Scottish-christian-historical-romance,"Regan is a young lady barely a bride before she beame a widow. Temporary memory loss leads her into the arms Iain Campell, a laird, warrior, christian who also happens to be her husband's killer. The challenge for the two-destined lovers is overcoming amnesia and suspicion and of course other enemy lairds.I guess the author's primary focus was to highlight the power/beauty of forgiveness the way God desires of us and in that she did a good job. The very happy ending had me wanting more"
2,Wings Of Morning,I enjoyed the first book which tempted me to get the second but it is far too religious for my tastes.
4,Very good .,"I really am enjoying this series. It has lots of intrigue, a great love story and Christian principles also. I can't wait to read book three!"
5,wonderful,Loved this book fits in perfectly with series. Would def read again and recommend to friends. Only thing i would want is alittle more info on what he is doing
4,Second Installment as Good as the First,"When you first meet Regan on her wedding night you can't help but love her sweet and innocent nature. When she decides to put herself in danger in pursuit of the greater good you can see how strong of a woman she is. Having already been introduced to the handsome Ian Campbell in the first Highland Hills novels, it is was easy to believe in his honest and good nature. This is truly a love to aspire too."
5,Wings of Morning,this was a very good book. It kept my interest going and I could not put it down! Very good plot
2,Slow go,I bought this book based on other reviews I read but this book I am struggling just to read it. It's predictable and boring. I fall asleep every night quickly when I pick this book up.
5,Wings of Morning,"Kathleen Morgan has done it again. Highland life in the 1500's is not easy with all the feuding clans. Life and Love are part of that life though, love of family and of God. Love and trust is the thread that carries her characters through."
3,The romance continues.,"Romance at its best. Loved the mix of history, romance and intrigue. The perfect end for the Campell saga. The Campbell vs McGergor still remains."
3,"Wings of Morning These Highland Hills, Book 2)","An extremely easy read with a young adult feel and an ending that was fairly predictable. It was the how, when, why that proved interesting and kept me reading. As a Christian romance it was rather heavy handed and seemed rather trite at times."
4,Great Read,The flow was flawless. You could feel each and ever emotion from all the characters. I look forward to reading the third book in the series. I will be checking out other books this author has written she has an awesome talent.
3,book lover,"It was OK, it's the 1st of a trilogy. It was the best of the 3. but buying on line was a money savings plus."
4,"Hey girl, what's up","I recently purchased this doll for my little sister. When I saw the cool commercial, I just knew I had to buy her one. Unfortunately, I think I was more excited about the doll then she was. She doesn't play with it that much and she threw Barbie's plastic cell phone in the trash, because in her words ""it looked stupid"".This doll is about average Barbie height (11.5 inches). If you raise the microphone to her mouth she sings songs; if you raise the cell phone, she talks on the phone. As advertised, you can also plug in your mp3 and Babie will move her mouth to the vocals (NOTE: she doesn't sing the songs in her barbie voice).I think this doll is a great idea. I wish I had one when I was a little kid. Unfortunately, they are a bit expensive, and some of today's kids aren't impressed. Someday this doll will be very collectible. Hopefully my little sister will stop throwing barbies accessories in the trash"
5,Barbie Chat Diva Review,My daughter is almost 6 and got this for an early birthday present. It was on for 19.99 Canadian which was great! Barbie sings 3 songs and her face movies. She also says many things on her cel phone. It is neat because my daughter hooked up her stero and Barbie moves her lips to it. My daughter also has the Bratz talking doll and she said she prefers this one because her mouth movies. Barbie also talks appropriately which is neat. Overall I rate it top stars!
2,Not the information I was looking for,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about which foods are alkalyzing, but intstead, it's more a very general guide to better eating and health. It also contains some interesting information from Edgar Cayce. I'm not sorry I read the book, but it really wasn't what I was looking for."
3,To summarize...,"The Alkalizing Diet: Your Life Is In The Balance presents nutrition basics, then mentions that based on your blood type and your genes you probably should or shouldn't eat this or that food, then there are pages about fasting, and then more pages about the ancient history of foods, and even more words about the current state of foods, and then more pages about twelve plants, and finally, the book ends with, a few Edgar Cayce readings.Page 186 from this book quotes reading 255 from the Edgar Cayce source: ""To say that any diet that adds proper forces to the body for blood, muscle and nerve building, is in error, is to cut self off - even as to say, ""This I may do, this I may NOT do"", see?""And then this author eventually stated, ""I tried to convey in the previous chapters, this is a complex question - what should I eat? - with a number of possibilities. Anyone who tells you otherwise is being less than honest."""
2,Needs improvement,"The locking mechanism for the various blade positions slides out much too easily, and I found that the blade would extend unintentionally when removing it from my tool pouch (too dangerous for me, novice that I am.) Other models lock well in both directions (this model does lock very solidly when extended), and I've replaced the 10-989 with a simpler Stanley model that stays locked in or out of the pouch. Right now it sits in my tool drawer for home projects."
5,I know what your thinking 6 bucks for a utility knife! But.,"Spead the little bit extra if you use a utility blade all day boys. I have been selling industrial tools for a long time, and its sometimes hard to get guys to part with those cheap Sears 99 cent utility knives, but now is the time. The Stanley swivel lock design is made so you can open the knive and change blades fast without any tools. The knive itself has some meat to it and is well balence and will not fall apart every time you drop it. This is a great tool, simple and basic, but still worth every penny for added convienence. Try one out, I am sure you will like how it adds a little extra sanity to your work."
5,24 Season ONe,"My husband and I missed the first 3 seasons, so we are going back to find out what happened in them. We highly enjoyed getting all the background from the first season. It was a great purchase and happy we took the time to watch the first season."
4,Jack Rocks,"After hearing all of the hype about 24, me and my wife decided to do it right and start at season one before watching any of the current season. Jack and the gang get you hooked quickly, and we haven't been able to stop watching. We've finished season one, will soon finish season two and seasons three and four are on their way via Amazon. This show is great, we can't wait to get home and watch more."
3,Potential,"Potential is the best word to describe the first season of this spectacular series. In retrospect, this season did not withstand the test of time. Teri Bauer was actually worse than Kim. I applauded her death. Dennis Hopper's accent was also atrocious. This show definitely improved with each season except Day 4, 6 and 8."
5,In the Beginning....,"If you are here reading this then I guess you're asking the question: 'What's all the fuss about?'. Not a year ago I asked the very same question and then I bought the first season of 24. By the end of it I wondered how I could've possibly missed it on TV. Then I bought the rest of the series.From the pioneering split screen perspective, now commonplace on our screens (ie: Trial and Retribution), to quality script and storylines, 24 has changed the way we look at TV. Highly original in format and pace there's nothing quite like it.In a nutshell it's 24 hours in the life of Jack Bauer, operative with Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit. The plot...well I can tell you nothing for fear of ruining every breathtaking twist and turn.A word of caution: those who prefer their thrillers grounded and having some semblance to reality should either suspend belief and climb on board for the ride or give up their place in the queue."
5,Great Series !!,"24 hours of intrigue, suspense, and betrayal. You won't be able to turn the TV off until the last disk is done."
3,Mixed feelings,"24 - Season One evoked mixed feelings.As entertainment, the first half of the season is an innovative roller coster thriller, but the second half falls apart and overstretches the viewer's willingness to suspend disbelief.As a moral message it just scares me. Jack Bauer will do ""anything to protect my family"". He breaks the law, he jeopardizes the lives of friends, colleagues, and strangers. We cheer him on because hey, it's OK to break the law if it's for a Greater Cause. Who can argue against that? 50 years ago, serial action heroes, e.g. Zorro, broke the law but usually when they were in a corrupt country or region with self-serving officials. Today, action heroes break the law because they are impatient with the system, or because the system doesn't meet their selfish needs. Do we cheer them on for the same reason?Recommended for the action and the thrills, but ask yourself how much you really sympathize with Bauer."
2,What is all the hype about?,"I completely don't understand all the good reveiws on this series. The first season is all I have seen and all I will ever want to see. It should be called 24 murders because that's all it is, one murder after another.Even though there is plenty going on, it still seems boring and I find myself just wanting to fast forward to the end.I won't ruin the ending if you have been living in a closet and don't know how the first season ends-- I didn't know when I watched it-- but you will be extremely disappointed in how they ""wrap up"" the season finale.In my opinion it was a complete waste of $50!! I sure wish I had shopped around and bought it used."
1,SEASON 24,"I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! Not only have I not recieved this product, but I have also not recieved a response of any kind from the seller whenI emailed him concerning the location of this package."
3,24 - season one,"Interesting to watch one time, which I saw within a couple of days. Not worth repeated viewings. Very well done for a TV 'soap opera' concepted TV series. After all the toil & rescues, to have Bauer's wife be killed at the end is a real downer. Maybe I got spoiled by the original Twin Peaks series, until its final episode.... that WAS innovative. After TP i vowed never to get hooked on another series again that didn't have great self-contained eps like ""Release"" on X-Files (although i found the alien abductions boring)."
2,Not very good to watch in sequence...,"Unlike many other TV shows that benefit from watching the episodes in sequence, without commercials or cuts (allowing you to ""feel"" the story more intensely and enjoying it more), this is not case for 24 HOURS.Even with perfect casting, great performances, clever editing, intriguing premise and good direction, watching this show in sequence is like watching an endless movie, that you want to end as soon as possible. All the excitment of waiting one week for the next episode is lost here, and you'll begin to think that the show is not so good as you initially tought it was... It's like taking an average two hour thriller an extending it forever."
3,Best Series on Television....but....,"I watched this series during it's run on FOX and while it kept you guessing, in the end, it did so at the expense of it's own credibility. Mid-way through it became clear the writers did not know what to do with characters - ie. Terri Bauer - and finally wrote themselves an out for future seasons using a cheat that insulted the regular viewers. This is a ""must watch"", but the ending is manipulative to the point of being anti-climatic. 3 out of 5 stars for effort, but could have been much better."
2,Not Sure What All the Hype is Over,"Poorly acted. Plot lines, while I realize that this is tv, are so far fetched it is ridiculous. So many events that happen are so silly, my wife and I did virtually nothing but yell at the tv asking how that ""event"" makes any sense...OK, so you have these sophisticated terrorists trying to arrange these two assassinations, but their whole plot hinges on the abduction of a teenager by two dim-witted dope heads. How in the world these two are able to drive around in that van and never get pulled over by the cops is astounding.All that being said, we watched all the episodes...why I don't really know, but we did.UPDATE: Well, season 1 was silly, but we bought and watched all of the rest and we are hooked. Although the last season, season 5, was kind of repetitive. But we still love the series."
3,Great Show - Horrible DVD,"It's unfortunate that such a jewel of broadcast television show has been memorialized in such a haphazzard fashion.No cue points within an episode - impossible to find commentary - half hearted audio mastering instead of true 5.1. Flimsy packaging.With such an elegant show, a more elegant presentation should be expected. Shame on Fox."
5,It really is that good-really.,"After having watched in wonder the broadcasts of the first season of ""24"" I was curious as to whether the breathless excitement would evaporate in repeat viewings, stripped of the ""first time"" thrill. When the show aired I was held captive every Tuesday night for an hour, watching the realtime countdown clock tick away the minutes. I couldn't wait until the next installment, and marvelled at how deftly the writers, directors and actors handled something so raw and new. In what is a tired medium, this was a revelation. Let me tell you, the DVD set brings back the ""out of control"" joy I felt watching the original broadcasts- and more. I can study the detail and see just how on the edge the production is- twists and turns of plot are still exciting, and hindsight makes everything that is said and done resonate with doom."
3,Disapointing Ending,"WARNING: Possible Spoilers.The first 5 episodes were great. The drama and suspense kept me glued to the screen. Unfortunately things started to get a little silly midway through the series. A lot of time is spent with Jack Bauer's wife and daughter being kidnapped, then escaping, then kidnapped again, then escaping, etc.The last episode seems to break continuity with everything that happened before. If you watch the previous episodes, you will know what I mean. One character, who turns bad out of the blue with no warning and no consistency with the plot ruined the show for me."
2,Disappointing,"Having missed this on TV, I had assumed that any series which could survive to the fifth season would be OK.While the real time concept is a novelty, the number of events which are packed into this day are beyond belief. Maybe the characters get the rest of the year off to recover?More worrying is the fact that CTU can be so easily infiltrated by moles and that CTU's ""best agent"" is easily manipulated and goes along with terrorist plans, waiting for some miracle to save the day and justify his actions. Too bad for all the innocent victims along the way.By about half way through the ""day"", we didn't really care too much about who won or survived in the end....Needless to say, we won't be buying any further seasons."
4,24 keeps you coming back for more!,"Like the old movie serials of the 30's and 40's, ""24"" keeps you on the edge of your seat with suprising twists and turns. Like one other reviewer said, ""Bet you can't watch just one!"" I watched all 24 episodes in 4 days. Though this season has plenty of action, it dosen't have quite the level of nail-biting action that the fourth season did. The language is certainly adult in some places, a lot more then season 4 and as usual the graphic violence. (The two reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) But I still can't wait to get Season Two!"
2,"Should be Rated ""R"" for sex (graphic enough),drugs, murder","I was supprised this was on TV!! It portrayed too detailed sexual acts, drugs, and violent/graphic murder. I already knew that these things happen especially in relation to terrorism but I didn't need to have every detail shown to me!!!I don't need that in my home -tossed in trash.~Family Man"
3,24 Season 1 - Nothing Really Special,If you don't have season 1 this set is a decent buy. However don't buy it as a collectors item if you already have season 1. The extra features and the gimmicky metal box don't add any value.
2,Intensely cheesy,"Suspenseful, in that it requires a complete suspension of disbelief. Sappy, because it uses every overworked plot device and cringe-inducing theatrical effect to club the viewer over the head. (E.g., Jack Bauer periodically takes twenty seconds to grimly canoodle with his equally grim, long-suffering wife as violins swell on the soundtrack). The dreck just marches through these episodes, with one-dimensional characters whose uniform demeanor is either wooden-faced confusion or wooden-faced stoic determination. This, even as the show's writers have them do mindlessly stupid things in order to to get themselves (over and over again) into impossible predicaments. The only redeeming thing about this series is its innovative chronological pacing, showing events in real time over a twenty-four hour day. Too bad the creators didn't bother trying to make it realistic. If the U.S. actually has a counter-terrorism agency staffed with people this moronic, we're done for. Get the hook."
5,AWESOME SERIES,"It's an AWESOME, ACTION PACKED, SIMILAR TO THE REAL THING (ONLY THAT WE DONT KNOW ABOUT THE MILITARY AND CIA DIRTY SECRETS) SERIES. What I don't understand is that WHY!!! does amazon duplicate the price of the slim packs?. I have gotten seasons 1-4 in the slim pack version and none of them has costed me more than $27 per series, new condition and with free shipping. I guess they don't want to sell their stock and are letting their external sellers to increment sales, KEEP IT UP AMAZON!!!"
2,"Watched it, OK","I found the action and suspense to be decent; I found the events to be too flawed to really enjoy it. I found myself asking the question ""Why would an organization be so stupid as to _______"" The story line following Jack's daughter was also a bit stupid, and I would have been happier with shorter episodes and leave her part out altogether."
2,arrived damaged,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift and it arrived in a soft sided envelope. The metal case was crushed on one side. Since this was for a gift and we were spending the holidays out of state, I purchased the item in a local store for less than I paid for this one. The bright spot was the return was easy and I received my money back."
3,Satisfied again,"Good price, received in timely fashion, and set was in very good condition. I am happy with my purchase."
5,It blew us away!,"This is the best drama that we have seen from TV in years. We couldn't wait to get to the next episode; watched the whole DVD set in one weekend. My husband said, ""You did good"" in selecting this for our viewing entertainment. Don't look for perfection in use of ""technical devices,"" just enjoy the drama!"
5,Review,"The first season of 24 is awesome! Very well thought out, well-written, and exciting. Great actors! Each episode leaves you in anticipation for what happens next! One nice thing of having the whole season at once - you can watch as many episodes in a row that you want!"
5,Can't wait to buy it!!!,"...If you never watched ""24"", think of it like one of the longest movies and greatest movies of all times and do not think of it like a simple TV show, YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!!"
2,Disappointing overall,"While this series started out with much promise, I can't help but think it would have been more enjoyable if watched once a week instead of over a couple of days. Then perhaps the plot holes and continuity errors wouldn't have been so blatantly obvious. As it was, by the end of the series my husband and I were laughing hysterically over the utter improbability of the whole thing. God help us all if those who are actually tasked with fighting terrorism were so easy to infiltrate, so incompetent over all and utterly dependent on one man (who was fooled through the entire season by a mole in his own department), to save the day."
5,Fear the Power of Bauer!!!!!,"What can I say about this season...It absolutely rocked. I've seen and own every season of 24 and season one may be my favorite. Jack Bauer always seems to find a way to save the United States even under impossible circumstances. Jack's ""last"" stand in the final episode was tremendous and might be his best scene yet.As for as the product goes I wish they would have included more bonus materials on a seventh disc. That's my only gripe. Excellent product...10/5 stars"
3,Thank Goodness for Torture,"The first season was fun. The concept for ""24"" a novel, exciting one. No other season since was as good. The downside is that ""24"" helped the public get used to the idea that torture is a vital necessity for saving American lives -- an idea which most experts in the real world intelligence community overwhelmingly disagree. In effect, this television program has been successful propaganda for the rightwing and Bush Administration (regardless of what any actor may think of his role or makers of a TV show claim)."
4,An instant classic,"The first season of 24 is the best, which is saying something because all of them are great. It is intense, fast paced, and not confusing like so many contemporary action shows and movies are. Do not buy this if you cannot afford to buy all of the seasons, because you will end up doing just that."
1,NonStop Action and Suspense At A Snails Pace,"I realize this isn't a movie where you introduce characters, develop the plot, and wrap everything up in 2 hours, but after watching 8 episodes, I don't believe ""snails pace""adequately describes the slow moving plot.Did the writers really need a whole season to cover 24 hours?One episode/show for each 24 hours would have made it more watchable.I made it through 12 episodes. I can't take any more.One problem with reviews for TV series is the vast majority of reviewerspurchase the DVDs after watching episodes aired on TV. Who wouldspend money on DVDs if they didn't like the series when it aired on TV?Most TV Series are rated 4 and 5 stars on Amazon.Yes...Even the ""Flying Nun"" (Sally Field) and Beverly Hillbillies are rated 4 and 5 stars.I bought ""The Shield"" and ""The Sopranos"" without seeing them aired on TV.Both excellent series (with sub-plots). I would recommend watching some""24"" episodes on TV before purchasing. Its not for everyone."
5,Gripping and Addicting,"My husband had to twist my arm to watch this with him, but after about the first 5 minutes I was hooked and couldn't wait to watch the next episode. Each time an episode ended I'd look at him and beg for just one more, even if it was way past bedtime. You won't regret watching this one, it's an incredibly gripping and intense storyline. I can't believe how intricate of details they managed to put in each episode. Very well written and acted."
3,Why such a high price for this???,"I love these slim packs of 24 but I mean why in the world do they cost more than the original pack of 24?? You can buy the normal set for about 20-30$, and I do not understand why the release version of the same thing is twice the price of the original release?"
1,Only 8 episodes available with Prime!,"Got started on this series expecting to watch via prime thru the first season. Guess this was just a teaser to get you to buy the remaining episodes from Amazon?If this is a trend with instant prime videos, no thanks."
2,To much bull,"How many times can his wife/daughter be kidnapped by the same people. And, how many times can he loos contact with the once he love. All in 24 hours! This could have been such a great series if the corporate 2 million-a-year guys could grab a cab and drive to some other planet."
1,Overrated series,"The series looses at the end, seems a lot but It's nothing special. I's all hype, hype and more hype, nothing more. It's a very overrated series like everything FOX does."
4,The Trouble with 24,"24 represents some of the best story telling and acting that has ever been on television. But that does not mean that it's without serious faults. The most dominant of which is the grotesque liberal writing, especially in Season 2. The most obvious problem with the writing is the utter lack of concern to writing stories that are polarizing. You will either love or hate the story agenda.What we have here are writers that are pushing a liberal notion of saving the world that one will either choose to believe or find offensive."
2,Only made it to 7am,"I'll admit it: the plethora of great HBO box set releases, as well as the occasional classic show like The Prisoner, brainwashed me a bit. If they're releasing the entire season on DVD, there's no way I can miss it! Kinda silly of me. 24 is interesting as a TV show, but it is still at its core a garden-variety TV show and nothing but. The narrative gimmick is indeed interesting, but beyond that, the show doesn't take any risks. The acting often becomes... unnecessarily operatic... and the story quickly becomes obsessed with surprising the viewer. He's good! No, he's bad! She's in trouble! No, she's not, because she's badder than he is! After awhile, I just stopped caring."
3,"Good Intro to all seasons, but not amazing","Pros:Good acting as alawaysGood plot (believable)Great suspense, especially the first 12 hours and last 6 hoursGreat endingCons:Many boring seens (to me) from 1-6 PMVery poor special featuresOverall:I would reccommend this season to anyone who has never seen 24 at all. The reason why I gave this season three stars is because I saw some of season 5, which was intense, before season 1. I also saw a good amount of season 6 (also intense) before season 1. This threw me away because these seasons are nothing like the first. Also, if you see season 1 first you'll have no problem understanding the others because some events in past seasons are mentioned in recent ones. Don't start in the middle of any season because you may get confused with the plot as I did."
3,Too circular,"Season one of 24 is a good show, to a point. The plot starts out very good, but becomes very circular. As soon as a sub plot is completed, the writers send you back to the same sub plot. I'm not going to go into too much detail, so that I don't give it away for those of you who want to see it. 24 season one could have been so much better if it had stayed closer to Jack.Many of the characters are good, but a lot of them look and act the same way. Jack's wife looks too much like his second in command, and both are a bit wimpy. Palmer's son is too short sighted and his wife is the cliché of a bad wife.If the other seasons must have been better, or I don't see how that stayed on the air as long as it did. I'm disappointed!"
3,"It was going great, but then became a soap opera","I was genuinely hooked watching this DVD set for the first 8 or 9 hours. I couldn't get enough. But then as it concluded the first assassin/kidnapping story, it quickly turned into a soap opera. The wife discovered she's pregnant, the daughter is hung up on the kid who kidnapped her, the wife discovers that her husband slept with his female coworker, she sees her daughter go over a cliff in a car and apparently die to her eyes. The wife gets amnesia (oh, come on!) and wanders off. The senator's aide turns out to be sleeping with one of the assassins (right out of ""Clear and Present Danger"" or ""Day of the Jackal""). Yada yada yada. I could easily tell the people who created the series had left after the first story arc came to an end."
4,Groundbreaking Television,"The first season of ""24"" has more twists and turns than Chubby Checker as the events unfold in real time. Featuring a stalwart cast headed by Kiefer Sutherland, this innovative series represents an admirable breakthrough in a TV landscape littered with dreary sitcoms and ""reality-based"" garbage. Though ""24"" is not without flaws, the show's breakneck pacing and cliffhanging scenarios outweigh the occasional missteps. This six-DVD set remains the best way to appreciate ""24"" as an integral whole - minus commercials."
4,Hate the clock,The content and acting performances are excellent. The clock every five minutes drives me crazy - use fast forward !
5,24 -- Season One,This is my first experience ordering DVD's from Amazon. It was such a great experience that I have recently ordered more DVD's. The products have been in excellent condition and I have received them much more quickly than anticipated. This is the only way to order DVD's!!!
1,Would not recommend,"This is not a review of the show - which is outstanding of course! - but of the product itself.When I first received this set I inspected the discs and found one of them had fallen out of the sleeve and was very scratched. I returned it but when I received the replacement set saw that the aluminum box was badly dented. I opened box to inspect the discs and found that on 4 of them there dark particle contaminents on the surface of the disks.I promptly returned that set for a refund and ordered the the older 24 Season One set instead.I want to make it clear that I do not believe this was a problem with Amazon, but a packaging issue from the manufacturer."
5,The best show on television!,"I started watching 24 during the 2nd Season and even after 5 minutes, I was completely hooked. I even got my mom and my aunt watching it! My aunt bought Season 1, which I just finished borrowing from her. It's just as intense as the 2nd season (which, btw, I ordered before today's release date!) Just beware of watching 24... once you watch, you'll never want it to end! Whenever they show the clock ticking, I yell at the tv that it can't be over! Silly, but true! Now I'm just counting down for the premier of season 3"
3,Good show. Lazy DVD production,OK maybe I'm just spoiled with DVD extras these days. The price for 24 episodes is cheap I'll give them that. And the show is really good. But couldn't they have tried a little harder with the DVD? The thing doesn't even have chapters for god sakes! You just start the episode and if you wanna go somewhere later into the episode...well I just hope you have a very fast fast-forward button.
3,Cool show poor DVD features,24 was an intense rollercoaster ride of a TV show. I was disappointed that the DVD was not in Dolby 5.1 and that there where no chapter stops within each episode. I think that there is something for the true fan because seeing it for the second time and knowing the story line lets you see subtle hints that you did not catch the first time.
5,Simply Amazing,"24 is simply the best show on TV at this time. This first season is very intense, and a much watch for people who love the show, or for people who want to get into it before season 3. The only problem I have with these DVD's is the packaging is a bit on the cheap side, but that doesnt effect the quality of the show in the somewhat cheap package."
3,Soap Opera vs Thriller,"Forget the Counter-Terrorist aspects of this DVD set.....forget all about Cops..or Good vs Evil...this is SOAP OPERA of the highest order....what DAYS OF OUR LIVES and the late ANOTHER WORLD aimed for, so gallantly....this is serious Brain/Eye Candy...and it took me a couple of viewings to realize as much...Kiefer Sutherland i ""admire"" at second hand..his father, Donald, was very good...'when he was good""...but when he was bad he was horrid...same for the son.....if you like Car Chases...Gun Play to the Max..and Screaming Women...this one's for you....will I watch it again?...You bet.....and i want to know what happens in Season 2, anyway....."
4,Great product.,"Product arrived within one week. Discs were in great condition, but box was a little beat up. Would order from seller again."
4,"Great Show, Not A Great DVD","This was by far the best show of the season.With its original storyline, great characters (except for Kim, she's as dumb as a box of rocks), and even greater actors (again except for Elisha Cuthbert),this show will keep you on the edge of your seat and aghast at some of the plot twists.Starts off slow but quickly works its way up by the end of the 1st episode.The DVD only gets 4 stars because there are no special features, but easily gets 2 stars for being released WIDESCREEN as it was originally shot."
5,Good Stuff,"We did not watch this series on television because it conflicted with another series that we preferred (our current TiVo records only one channel at a time). Getting the DVDs after the fact may have turned out to be better than ""live"" TV. It plays out more like a long movie than as a TV show.It was hard to imagine a show of 24 episodes portraying what a movie might cover in one-tenth the time. However, it is very active (not just jiggly cameras and rapid scene transitions) and keeps your attention. There is a lot going on and it is done very well -- almost movie quality viewing.The technical aspects are good -- video, editing, sound, transfer to DVD, etc. But, that always plays second to the plot. This one is pretty good."
5,A Day of Hell is Heaven for the Viewer,"24 is the most imaginative concept to come along in a drama category in many a year. Each episode reflects one hour of one day in the life of Jack Bauer, CTU Manager. The writing is first class with plots and subplots aplenty. The story lines all tie together and keep you on the edge of your seat - much like the old Saturday matinee cliff hangars. The acting is very controlled ie. very good. There isn't anything on the small screen to compare with 24 - both Season 1 and 2."
5,Best TV show ever!,"This is by far the best television series I have ever seen. I was completely hooked each week; a herd of wild buffalo could not have dragged my from the couch when 24 was on each week. I would highly recommend this series to anyone. Suspense, drama, action, this show had it all, from characters I loved, to characters I loved to hate. Get it!"
4,Most notable of the series,"I was reluctant when this show first aired, but the mixture of suspense, the thrill and drama of the show capativated me to continue watching. I have been keeping up with the show. So far I believe that season 1 is one of the best in the series. The show has had some ups and downs, but it continues to deliver and I hope it does so for the remainder of its run on the air. I would recommend this season its a great price and a great show."
3,Dead batteries in Special Addition box,The box showed up with dead batteries so I have no clue what the display on the front of the special edition box is suppose to display.
5,Great Buy!!!,"24 Season 1 is the only series that drew me to buy the whole season. The show is AMAZING!!, I almost made it to work late alot cause I had to watch episode after episode."
5,"Gripping, Great Television","I almost watched this DVD set in 24 hours straight! Great stuff, unpredictable, complex, good acting."
5,Incredible,"So many of my friends said they thought of me when they watched this series on tv, I felt compelled to buy it for a father's day gift one year. Needless to say, we were sucked in from the first hour and literally watched this season in 24 hours--stopping only when absolutely necessary!! This show is really for anyone--the huge cliff hangers at the end of EVERY single hour are unbelievable--the writing is genius!!!"
5,Captivating! My Wife and I couldn't Stop Watching.,"My Cousin brought this over and I must admit I wasn't in any hurry to watch it. It took me a week before I could muster up the courage to watch an episode. When I did, I was hooked. I watched 6 episodes of the 24 late at night and couldn't wait to find the time to watch the others.My wife didn't really want to watch it either, but she finally gave it a chance. She was an instant addict as well!The show is very well done. Instead of just one story about an antiterrorist agent, it has many that all interlink. It is packed with action and suspense that will keep you guessing tillthe very end. If you want great entertainment, buy this DVD"
1,24 season one,"I ordered this product on Nov 28. When it had not been received by Jan 2, I emailed the seller but have not yet received a reply."
1,Congratulations: we have the new plot hole record-breaker!!,"Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations: we have the new plot hole record-breaker!! (spoilers below)This is the lamest show I've ever watched. It's all appearance, no substance.First of all, we have a lead character that's hardly even likeable; it's a selfish, mean and paranoid guy.Then, we have plot holes larger than anything I've ever witnessed. Check that bad guy Gaines, for example: to obtain the ID card, he pays one million dollars to a highly professional female killer. To kiddnap the annoying girl Kim, also a substantian part of the bad guy's plan, he hires two stupid and intoxicatd teenage boys! How clever!!Also, we have characters that simply dissapear. One George Mason was clearly designed to be a pain the ...s of Jack Bauer, then he simply vanishes.It's a show to watch just once, and never again, so I recommend to rent the DVD."
2,Reality gets left behind in 24,"Okay, after getting hooked on ""The Shield"" DVD seasons, I gave ""24"" a try because I think that Sutherland is a good actor. Unfortunately, he is the only saving grace in this otherwise worthless show. There's more BS DRAMA shoved into every scene, every conversation, than is ever plausable. The characters are COMPLETELY unrealistic, constantly trying to insult and out do each other. Cars explode like they were made of nitro glycerine, people are killed left and right, guns never run out of ammo, and more Hollywood drool worthy of Jerry Bruckheimer himself. DON'T BUY THIS DVD SET, if you're interested, find somewhere you can rent it instead, and by disc 3 you'll be begging for the bad guys to win and kill off the rest of the cast!"
1,This is a joke!,"This series showed so much promise in the begining. There was so much suspense and intrigue, and the show seemed so original, but soon it all fell apart. Not only were many of the plot lines ridiculous, they were also full of holes! For example, when Kim and Terri are being chased after the attack on the safe house, Terri makes a turn to lose their pursuers. She then stops the car and gets out saying she's going to see if they are still being chased. If their is a chance that you are being chased, why would you get out of your car? I don't think you would. I can name many more as well, like when Jack is bugged, how come the transmitter isn't detected when he walks through CTU. It would have to be quite some bug.I have no idea how this show was nominated for emmies. The acting isn't even that great.Alias is a much better show. It also has rather farfetched stories but you can probably dismiss them since the show is more along the lines of science fiction and fantasy."
1,Possibly the greatest TV show Ever!...If I could only hear it.,"It would be nice if there was volume, it isn't working. If it were working, this would be 5 stars."
3,Too much hype led to high expectations,"While it was a critically acclaimed show, I was disappointed by all the hype. It's a good show, but not great. I thought that twenty four episodes representing 24 hours in the day was a great idea, but felt let down very quickly (around episode 2 or 3). What happened in that ""24 hour day,"" really would have happened in a week. Also, plot lines that should have been abandoned (like the kidnapping aspect) after the first attempt are continued on and on. At least one of the stupid characters dies in the end.The sorest point for me was that Kim's character was such an idiot. Yes, when I'm running for my life from kidnappers, I'll make sure to call my mommy too. Police and 911 are so overrated.I started watching the second season, but gave up after episode one. It was interesting, but not exciting enough to continue."
1,rip off,I sign up for Prime and they still tried to charge full price for all instant video on my Roku. It is a bate and switch. Save your money.
4,"More Plausible Than Season 2, Though Less Captivating.","The ""24"" series, for those who don't know yet, is one of the best things to happen to television in years. That sounds cheesy, but it's true. I am a skeptic/critic, and while I may find flaws, both season one and two of ""24"" will not disappoint.I watched the second season of ""24"" before I watched the first season. I enjoyed the second season but disliked the twist of the story about half way through. Season one gives the usual--suspense, drama, action--but I believe the story to be more plausible and cohesive than the second season. While season one is more cohesive, I do believe season 2 is more exciting, thrilling.Overall recommendation: Highly recommended for lovers of action, adventure, spy, or thriller genres. The second requirement is a A LOT of time--at about 20 hours per season, one needs some serious time to watch these. A WARNING: ""24"" is very addicting."
4,Good but very intense,This is not a relaxing show so if that is what you are looking for keep looking. I have to take breaks between seasons. It's not your calm murder mystery. It is an intense play by play political counter terrorism story. The whole one hour real time per episode is neat.
2,plot holes and unrealistic,"Okay, I admit I watched the whole 24 episodes, but I won't try season two. By the 20th episode it was so full of plot holes I almost stopped but I had to finish the story. Action scenes and music were good, but that's about it. Spoilers--- Why would they have to blow up a whole plane when they could have just killed the one person before they got on board?- for gratuitious overblown drama, an example that describes this whole show. For people with so many resources and so much training, they sure screw up a lot. On the plus side, Dennis Haysbert and others give good performances, though it's sad what hackneyed writing Dennis Hopper had to bear. I'm willing to give some license to an action show, but the plot holes were far, far too many to forgive."
3,Clear the decks,"I had seen a total of one episode of 24 on TV and was frustrated at the inconclusive end of that hour. But everyone raves so much about the series - plus, I heard it had a number of politically incorrect elements to it - I decided to get the full first season and watch it in chunks. And boy, do you need to watch it in chunks! Calamity after calamity; misery after misery! Aother reviewer called it a soap opera. In deed it is. It's a soap opera for men. I had to watch at least three shows at a time to feel like the plot had moved forward at all. Yeah, the action, the acting and the characters are terrific, but what anvil will fall on the good guys next!?!? Another complaint I have about this season one is -> next to no bells and whistles on the DVD, they didn't even index the shows. Bummer! So I'm up in the air about getting the next seasom. I might; but I'm not sure."
4,what a page turner!,"When this show first was on TV, and I heard the consistent praise, I thought that I'd watch it during summer reruns. It wasn't rerun. As the mother of a not yet driving teenager, I knew better than to try to commit to never missing an episode. I finally rented the 1st DVD three days ago. The next day I returned it and bought the set. Tonight, having just finished the 1st season, I came to Amazon to pre-order the 2nd. The only thing wrong with this show is the wait for the season to be over before buying. Watching at leisure and all at once is the best way!"
5,Get ready to be on the edge of your chair! Overall: 4.5,"Pros: Starts well, ends decently, the middle, though, is a big mess, Kiefer Sutherland, Penny Johnson, Dennis Haysbert, Sarah Clarke, and maybe Elisha Cuthbert, Amazing show, Beautiful Audio/Video transfer, Highly suspenseful, intelligent, and engrossing show. The acting and writing are both terrific. Novel idea, suspenseful plot with interesting and realistic characters, beautiful transfer, sound.Cons: Loses focus, badly cast supporting roles, not enough ideas to go around, Plot holes and side tracks! I want Alberta Green BACK in this series, Could have had more extra's, A few stumbles, complete lack of extras is frustrating, no chapter searches within episodes, the time laps seems impossible such as jack and many characters doing many things in 1 hour, which is impossible in our real society today.Overall, I would give it a 4.5!"
3,Great Show and Series;,There was no closed captioning offered (as on too many through amazon unfortunately)so didn't rate higher. Played well on my kindle fire!
5,24 season 1,I missed all but the last 3 seasons of 24. I just finished season 1. It's a nail biter too. My experience with ordering through Amazon was great. i will use them for all my on line dvds and books
2,How did 24 survive this season?,"I came to 24 late - season 5 - and was hooked. I then purchased all the previous years. Year 1 is awful. It spends too much time with the Kim Bauer character who is a whiney, wimpy, loud, obnoxious teenager. Jack deserves better. I guess she is there to get the teen boy audience to tune in or closet child molesters. As to the DVD, the plot line is turgid and the acting is uninspiring. If I had started out with year 1 I would not have gotten any farther. As it were I could only get through the first three CDs before trashing it. Year 2 is much, much better. The Kim blight is still there doing meaningless stuff and screaming a lot but you can fast forward. Thankfully she appeared hardly at all in Season 5. If you are interested in 24 avoid this one."
3,Excellent show,"I am writing this review because I wasn't really a huge fan of the show during this season. I watched the show and thought it was good but not great. Since then, I have watched the more recent seasons and am now a full fledged fan of the show. I can only say that about a handful of shows over my lifetime (x-files, simpsons, seinfeld, family guy). Since I truly enjoy the show now, I figured that I would go back and buy the available seasons on DVD and give them a ""re-try"" if I can call it that. I have to say, I am very pleasently surprised. They are much better than I remember. This is truly a very strong show that I hope remains on the air for a long time. I only give this set 3 stars though, becuase even though I think that this show is great, I felt that this season is the weekest out of all the seasons. It is very worth buying though."
2,Why has this show garnered good press?,"OK, the first two discs are incredibly entertaining, but after that I kept rooting for the people who were in danger to be shot. The self-righteous presidential candidate and Bauer's wife and daughter (ESPECIALLY the wife and daughter) quickly became tedious. It's difficult to know where to begin but let's say that after a teenage girl is abducted, hit, a witness to multiple murders, and threatened with death every half hour, the logical thing to do when freed is to return to her kidnapper for help and then kiss him??!! Good grief. Actually, except for Nina, most of the women on the show are actively stupid. (See presidential aide with her letter opener for further evidence.) A good premise with a solid performance from Sutherland, but can we silence the writers after we take care of many of the characters? Check out the first two seasons of ""Alias"" instead."
3,Watchable but not great,"I can accept the implausibility of many parts of the program for dramatic purposes. However, I found the season end rather unsatisfying. It left many questions unanswered and about who was involved in the conspiracy and did not tie together the end of the season to the beginning."
3,24: Season One Special Edition,"Overall enjoyment of the movie is good and Season one of 24 is probably one of my favorite among all seasons. However, absence of Dolbi Digital or DTS is a big let down, espeacially for a ""special edition"" like this. This is the main reason why I could only offer 3 star."
2,Don't Buy Into All the Hype,"Basically, what you have here is a conventional terrorist thriller with the 24-hour gimmick.It features heaping mounds of mindless exposition, lots of running around (the purest form of dramatic filler), laughable plot contrivances (Jack's daughter being kidnapped 5 TIMES over the course of ONE DAY, his wife a PREGNANT AMNESIAC), and a villain that is the live-action equivalent of Boris Badenov.Rent it if you're curious, but trust me...this is not the sort of entertainment that holds up to repeat viewings. It's virtually all surface flash with no deeper meaning or genuine artistic merit."
3,Great action but full of promiscuous sex,"My husband and I were very excited to begin watching this show because we had heard so many good things about the action and suspense. We were pleased with those things, but were shocked by the sex in the show. After the first episode, we hoped it would get better but after watching two more, it only got worse. The third episode even had two lesbians kissing. We are so disappointed. We plan to throw the whole season away. What a waste of our money and what a sad testimony to the moral state of our society."
3,okay series,"well the first couple hours are pretty good but around the 2 pm hour it get's a bit exhausting...you would probably just want to skip through most of it and just watch it until 12, then skip the rest until the last 3 hours. if your a die hard fan of the show then i would go for it but if you werent a die hard fan i would pass on it because of the level that it takes so long to get through the series...plus if you've already seen the whole series it loses it's appeal because some of it's fun was guessing on all the twists and turns the show had, once you know those the show wouldnt be worth anything."
2,Some of the hottest air around....,"What IS all the hype about? Just because this show isn't as disasterous as ""UPN"" or ""WB"" slop doesn't mean it's great television. Is it fast? Uh-huh. Is it good? Not really. How quickly some forget about the great TV shows, luckily you can currently pick up DVD sets like the Rockford Files, Columbo, and Quincy. Or put your 24 dollars towards Starsky and Hutch... those were the days, when CHARACTERS mattered, not fast camera work."
2,Better in small doses?,"This stuff isn't meant to be watched straight through. Watch one hour per week and use the other 167 hours to forget all the details so that you wont be bothered by the inconsistencies, stupid plot shifts, continuity problems, etc. Think about it: whose life is really interesting 24 hours a day? It would be better if we had 6 hours of Kiefer sleeping. At least we could fast forward through that."
3,"24 isn't bad, but Alias is better","24 is definitely not a bad show. It's pretty entertaining and exciting and the acting's not all too shabby either. However, I'm sad to say that it doesn't compare to its ABC spy show counterpart Alias. Alias is definitely THE show to watch and get hooked on, with neverending, edge-of-your-seat excitement and action. Plus, the cast, featuring Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber (both nominated for Emmys), is just tremendous, and deftly pulls off storyline after storyline. Take my advice and wait for the Alias DVD to come out before splurging on this one."
4,Season 1 & 2 was good but then???,What the hell is going on with season 4 I mean like almost all people from season 3 is gone. WHY WHY WHY!!! I don't see how a season 5 will ever work.
5,this is an excellent series,"I am totally hooked on 24 it is amazing. It isnt a straight forward good vs bad there are lots of sub plots, that keep you guessing on who the bad guy is in CTU. Kiefer Sutherland is excellent as Jack Baur he pulls the part off as if it were really happening to him, there is an amazing supporting cast as well. Although in the UK it is only dinner time, i challenge anyone to watch one episode and not get hooked. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD in the UK, as i will certainly be ordering it ASAP"
2,Tired of all this re-releasing.,"24 is a great show. Among the best of all. And season 1 was its best, but this set is another example of the lame tendency Fox has to release everything 7 or 8 times in different editions. If there really was useful bonuses to include on a new edition, why not have done it last year on the slim case edition. The packaging is not that bad, the features are interesting and the show itself is exelent, but the fact that this is actually the third time that this season is released on DVD is just another lame excuse for Fox to suck money out of dedicated fans. There is no need to buy this edition if you have one of the previous ones."
5,Ambitious TV on a grand scale,"It's only 11am, so far, for 24 over here in the UK.... I tip my hat to fox for having the [guts] to sanction and keep faith with this show.It is brilliant TV considering the restrictions of a TV production budget. But it goes to show that with good script writing, cutting edge dialogue with all the risks involved, you can produce a damn fine show.When this comes out on DVD (rumour has it August 18th 2002) I'll be making a purchase. In the meantime I just have to avoid any spoiler information from the web concerning the show.If you haven't been watching 24......just what exactly have you been doing?? GET A LIFE and introduce 24 to your life!!"
4,Missing Extras,"Overall, we were very pleased with the quality of the DVD set. You get a lot for your money. However, we were very disappointed with the ""extras."" As another reviewer has already mentioned, the alternate ending was silly. The preview of season two wasn't a preview at all. I guess it was so disappointing because there is so much they could have done...But, hey, for the price it's a good deal..."
5,The BEST TV you'll EVER see!,"This series of DVD's has been such a great use of a Saturday. I have never been so drawn into a TV show, until I saw these DVD's. Not only was the show great, but the show was just so well-written...especially the end of the 1st season!! After I watched an episode, I had to watch the following one. I couldn't sleep unless I watched the other one. I watched 16 episodes in 1 DAY. That is how goos this show is. Watch it if you didn't see the series on TV. Believe me, you will enjoy every second of the longest day of Jack Bauer's life."
3,Where is the Blu-ray ?,"I love 24 and I love special editions, but I will not double dip until the Blu-ray comes out. Where is the Blu-ray of this great show ?!"
5,WOW!!! W-O-W!!!!!,"Don't watch this series on tv. It's only worth on dvd as you coudn't expect for a week to see what happens next.This extra long movie - series has it all:Action, great scenario, good character development, saspens, conspiracy, everything and it doesn't lack in perfection but only in minor points ( has to do with scenario coherence which you won't understand unless you know what to look for).There is no chance that you will get tired of the series as I saw it in a few days and I really didn't have that much free time.The cast is great (Sutherland needs to be congratulated by someone near him) and everybody is perfect in its role except Jack Bower's wife whom I didn't like that much (They should put a prettier chick!!!) -Really she sucks and gave it on my nerves-This series is too much for the tv as never before have I seen something that match 24. I don't know about the 2nd season and what it's story is all about but the 1st was really something else."
5,Season One: Simply Superb,"I have to admit I missed the first 6 hours of 24 when season one came out but was immediately hooked thereafter. After now seeing the first 6 episodes on DVD, I am complete! How can you describe season 1? Imagine putting your foot on the accelerator and gunning it down the freeway, then to slow down and get off on the side road to coast. Only to hit the accelerator again dodging and weaving into incoming traffic. That's the sheer rush one gets when watching this innovative tv-movie thriller.Get it! You will be on the edge of your seat wanting more. Guaranteed."
5,"Absolutely the best, but...","I have to agree with all the other accolades, with one minor glitch. I have driven in LA several times. Now, even at 2:00 in the morning, you do NOT get across town in 10 to 15 minutes. Or get out of town, or into town within the time frame of the show. Maybe in Bumble Bee, Arizona you can, but not in LA. That's the only non-real time aspect of the show.It doesn't spoil it, just creates an ""as-if"" chuckle."
5,great season,this is a great purchase if you are a 24 fan. if you are currently watching the 5th season on fox on monday nights this season is a must for you to purchase and watch to get somewhat of a character backround on jack bauer. this is the start of the jack bauer that we all know now. I would also recommend getting seaons 2-4.
4,"Fine product, slow shipping","Waited at least 2 weeks for the book to be shipped. Do not understand why it took so long. When I asked the seller why it took so long so I could write a fair review, I never received a response."
1,Size description not accurate,"These gate latches used to be 5.25 inches long, and this was advertised as such. Now that Stanley is sourcing them from China, the size has shrunk to only about 3.5 inches long. This is a big difference when trying to replace. The dimensions shown in the advertisement indicated that this product was one of the orginal, instead what i recieved is no different than the componenet available at much less the cost from our local Value Star hardward dealer. Combined with handling and postage, this was just money thrown away."
4,Seem to work great so far!,"I haven't used these for very long, but so far i'm impressed with them. I have a 7 mth old daughter and after putting her through a round of antibiotics a few months ago for a double-ear infection, I was determined to try to avoid doing that again. When her pediatrician diagnosed her with another ear infection a month ago after going in for a nagging cough, I gave her these drops and it seems to have taken care of it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't used it long enough to know if it will work on a consistent basis. My daughter smelled strongly of garlic for a few days, but that's a small price to pay if it means I can treat her ears without resorting to medication. I also appreciate that it's very inexpensive and will last for a long time."
1,DO NOT BUY reaks of garlic does not work,"ok had pet and husband with bad ear infections constantly. 1 this reaks of garlic i can not stress this enough. 2. it gave my husband headaches, and 3 my dogs ear got worse. this is basically italian salad dressing they are trying to pass off as ear remedy. waste of money"
3,"Good product, but magnet missing","The product is fine (serves its purpose), but like other reviews mentioned, the magnetic strips were missing when it arrived. Amazon was amazingly fast at sending a replacement product, but it's still a hassle to repackage the other one to return and drop it off at the UPS center."
1,Don't Buy This - Region 2,"It's one of the BEST movies ever, but this Blu-Ray is made for UK & Netherlands. Beware which format you purchase. This shouldn't be for sale here in the Americas. I have an expensive coaster."
4,McAfee Virus Scan,"This product seems to do a good job of virus protection but the user interface is confusing. For example I haven't found an easy/quick way to disenable it when I'm installing new S/W. And, because I haven't bought all their other security products, I get constant popups telling me my computer is at risk."
1,Just Say No,"Please, as a professional educator and musician, stay away from these instruments. Yes, they look cool, but their quality is generally *extremely* poor. They break easily and often slip in pitch. Most of all, the sound quality isn't good at all compared to almost all other student models."
1,broken,"The first time my son tried to use it, it came apart and will be too expensive to fix. I had bought it early as a gift and so the defect was noticed too late for returning. Also, it was the wrong size."
3,Wrong Color and Slow Delivery.,"We ordered this item for our daughter for Xmas, and wanted it early, as they need the bridge put on and tuned, which we planned to have done.We ordered it Nov. 12th.The picture in Amazon was a brilliant light metallic blue.It didn't come until Dec. 1st. and then was a flat dark navy blue, with NO metallic look to it at all.We don't know if we were sent the wrong thing or not.The box said on the outside ""Metallic"".But, the dark navy blue intrument we got had no matallic look to it at all.We returned it and had to reorder a ""Two Tone Blue Violin"" from someone else who promised delivery within a week.We didn't want to reordered the metallic blue from anyone else in case the picture is simply NOT similar to the violin.We didn't want to end up with ANOTHER flat navy blue violin for a ""girl"".even closer to Xmas.Hopefully we will be able to pull this off in time for Xmas."
3,Um...,"I don't have this one. but I wanted to mention, as a student cellist, the bridge is supposed to be crooked. They are supposed to be carved into a bentish shape, and they can look crooked if you don't know what you're looking at. This is jsut in response to the other review. I was looking at this violin for my daughter, who woudl like to try a practice instrument before making a commitment. I personally have a Knelling, and it has lovely sound. You get what you pay for in an instrument, so I think we're going to find a good violin a auction or something instead. Although, isn't the blue adorable!"
2,Weak Plot,"The reviewer who said the costumes were overdone has obviously never been to conservative Moselm areas of the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia. The costumes were interesting and reasonably authentic. However, the overall plot is very weak -- which makes for a boring movie."
1,Danger!!,"This bulb is a fire hazard. Last night my wife smelled an electrical fire and had no trouble finding the source. it was a Feit Electric ESL23TM 23 W bulb. Really bad odor which still lingers today. The bulb has a warning not to use w/ dimmers or w/water (duh). This bulb was used in a simple one bulb lamp, on- off switch thats it. i hate to think what might have happened if this has happened if someone wasnt home. I bought 2 cases of these bulbs thinking i was doing my share , now, i am removing all.this is scary. do some research ,im only one of many"
1,Early burn out bulbs,"At the recycling center in the bulb bin, a huge percentage are Feit Electric. This matches my experience, I added a half dozen more flickering or dead ones to the bin. At work I bought a 40 Watt Feit bulb and it has burned out and been replaced under warranty 3 times (and we only moved in 4 months ago). I encourage everyone stuck with these crummy bulbs to pressure the company for better quality, by insisting they replace them. The number is 800-543-FEIT, they'll ask for the number off the bulb, and the place of purchase. You're not saving energy if the bulbs don't last!"
1,Possible Fire Hazard,Me too. Installed bulbs in two different lamps and they immediately began to smell. Was worried they would catch fire.
1,Miller`s Postcards:A Collector`s Guide.,I personally found this book sketchy and superficial.Unless you are for example a general dealer who just wanted a few basic guidelines about a subject you previously knew nothing about then please avoid like the plague...
3,Good beginner's guide,"For someone considering getting into postcard collecting and hasn't decided on a specialty yet, this guide is a great overviewof what postcard collecting is all about. The guide also has limited information on postcard values. These days you canfind out most of this information on the web. Certainly the experienced collector will need to look elsewhere."
4,He Used To Be an Animal,"This CD released in 1995 is a rare find. Many of the tracks on this collection were recorded around 1986 during the ""I used to be an animal"" recordings. This CD features alternate versions and outtakes from that session, all nicely done. ""Nightrider"" is the best song I have heard Burdon sing in awhile. This rocker along with other tracks: ""Brand New Day"", Woman's Touch, Is There Another World and Don't Shoot Me"" are worth the purchase alone and show that when Burdon is in the studio (which is rare now days), he is a creative genius and still one of the best and most versatile singers around. If you want a Burdon album this is one to buy."
2,What's the teacher's manual of this book?,"Concepts for Today contains many passages for academic reading skills development. If I were a publisher of this book, I would give test paper and guide paperbacks in e-mail text for the foreign students who study it with computer information searching."
3,Acceptable songbook from a show,"This collection is fine for fans of the show; the scoring has been only moderately adjusted, so it's not for two-finger pianists. While there is a bio of David Yazbek and four pages of photos, this volume lacks a plot synopsis, which would help those not familiar with the show to place the songs in context."
5,Great Irish Folk Artist,If you are looking for great Irish/Celtic folk music this is a must have album.A+
5,love this book,Book enjoyable for adults as well as children of all ages. Gives a good idea of what was happening in this country around world war 2. Full of feeling and humor.Bought at Amazon.
3,soft and sweet,"This CD would be perfect for an infant's bedtime or perhaps for curling up with the paper early Sunday morning. Generally, I find TB's voice and the simple accompaniment of guitar, ukulele and occasional Japanese stringed instrument to be overly gentle, sweet and timid. If the Japanese melodies were more familiar, I wonder if I would like this more. There's a little percussion on the last 2 numbers which liven things up a bit."
3,When are we going to get somewhere?,"This is by far not the usual fast- paced ,action-packed episode that we usually get with a Longarm novel. I got the impression ""Tabor Evans"" took off on a couple of weeks vacation and instructed an underling to write up a bunch of stuff about Longarm wandering around looking for some unknown crook for 3 months ;and when I get back ,I'll come up with something,and finish it off.If this is the first Longarm you've read ,don't give up;they are usually much better than this.Maybe all is not in vain;to keep up your intrest on this long journey;see if you can find the answers to these questions.What is the name of Longarm's laundryman?In what year was there an infestation of Hoof-and mouthdisease from Canada?What was Billy Vail's secretary's name?What is a cellarette?How much does Longarm earn per year?What was Longarm's barber's name?On what floor of the rooming house in Denver did Longarm live?"
2,Not worth the money...or the trouble,"If your hair is longer than 6"", or very thick, the ""easy clips"" will not work. The packaging says they are for big soft curls. Translation: you can not keep these rollers tight enough to give any kind of real, lasting curl to your hair."
3,Cheaply made,"My wife found that these curlers hold heat for a while helping to curl hair, but winding hair up in these is slightly difficult seeing as the glue doesn't hold the ends on very well. They pop right back on which is good but she wouldn't think that this should happen her 3rd time using them... She would go with a different type of curler."
4,Excellent Choice,"I purchased this product for my wife for Christmas. She has used it twice and likes the results. I also appreciate the way it makes her hair look. Packaging was slightly damaged by shipper, but product arrived in good shape."
5,Quality flocked hot curlers,"I have ordered these exact curlers before. This time I ordered two sets at the same time. I wanted more of the small and medium sized curlers and none of the largest size. So, I bought two sets and made the arrangement I need for my hair. I like the Remington currlers. I prefer the old metal pins rather than the plastic clips included now."
5,Stuff that really works,Orthogel really does take that pain away. It lasts for about 3 to 4 hours. None of the other creams work for me. All they do is have a funny odor. This stuff really helps.
5,Great for a pain in the neck...,This feels great on my neck when I am having pain. I really like that you can just roll it on instead of having to make a mess on your hands. It feel so cool going on and makes my neck feel better.
5,Great Pain Relief,We use Orthogel for its pain relieving quality. It works great.Also thanks to Amazon they do a great job as well.
1,Didn't work,"I bought this item based on the good reviews, but it isn't working for me. No difference.I bought for a bunion, and it doesn't stop any pain."
4,Pain Relief,"I purchased this item for my mother who suffers with Arthritis. My late aunt was given the gel to help relieve pain from one of her doctors. My mom started using the gel after my aunt passed, and found that it help with soreness and pain when she over stress her muscles."
3,"Onyx Stone Set (bracelet, earrings, necklace)",Pricing reasonable for the product. The necklace and bracelet are fine. I lost both earrings first time I wore them. I think I needed to bend the wires a bit to make them less likely to come out. I've never had that problem before with this type of wire hook type earrrings.
5,quick delivery and good quality.,"It arrived just in time as my son needed it for school. It is much cheaper than usually sold in professional music store. I don't have little experience on this instrument, but at this affordable price tag, I'd like to have it a try. So far so good."
1,Don't Buy This!,"I am a band director and wanted to warn you against buying this product. It may play well at first, but almost all of these instruments do not make it through a year without a problem. Most music stores will not repair them as they do not have the parts. You are way better off buying a used instrument from a time-tested brand."
1,Barcelona Squeaks - Selmar Rental Warm/Pleasant,"I so hated to return this. The Barcelona held out such promise based upon reviews, and I was swayed to it by the negative reviews of the other low-end competitor. My grandson played warm notes on a rented Selmar. That motivated me to buy him a clarinet outright. He could only get AWFUL squeaks out the Barcelona. He really tried. Based on the reviews, I had him use his own reeds as a test. Also took it to the instructor who confirmed it was assembled fine. The clarinet itself looks nice. Finally, had no choice but to return it. We rented a different Selmar (at a higher price, sigh) but at least now back to pleasant warm sounds that a clarinet is supposed to make. Maybe, we got the one bum unit in the lot."
2,squeaking,This clarinet does a lot of squeaking. My daughter uses it for junior band and she does a lot of squeaking. I do not recommend purchasing this clarinet.
1,Plastic and cheap!,"I ordered this for my eleven year old daughter because she is starting 6th grade and the school only provides loaner instruments to the lower grades. It came quickly, but what came was a Simba brand model CL-200 Clarinet. I admit that my daughter knows more about these things than I do becuse she has been taking clarinet for two years in school, but it looks to be a pretty cheaply made piece of plastic. Little more than a toy. My daughter says it is certainly useable, but not near the quality the school provided to her in 4th and 5th grade.I don't know what planet this thing would be worth what the ad claims to be the list price, the Amazon price (about 40% of list) is more reasonable.In the end; I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Good older game,"Good game, especially for an older one. Only 2 real complaints: Character movement speed (walk only), and the color doesn't come out right on Windows 7"
2,shareware,"This game was a disappointment, after reading reviews online I decided to try it. I purchased used game, when I played it it would only go to level 2 because it was some kind of shareware. I contact Amazon and I received a refund, yay Amazon.I might purchase a used game again and hope it is not shareware."
5,awesome game,"works just wonderful, no problems... i bought this for my 8 year old to use and he's got not complants"
2,Maybe it's defective,"Had a similar product that disappeared and purchased this as a replacement. Looks good, solidly made, etc. But unfortunately, does not cut the tape. I don't want to rant too much because maybe this one is defective (I might contact 3M). To tear the tape you have to press down hard on the package so the plastic fin flexes and the cutting blade protrudes. But, the blade is too short to stick out past the metal frame. Strange."
2,"looks cool, but hard to keep nice","This is a really cool looking table, but it's not that practical if you keep it in a room you use a lot. It's painfully difficult to keep clean --you need to use real cleaner every day to keep it looking nice, not just a quick dust off. It's of cheaper quality than I'd hoped. Make sure you also buy some coasters because drinks/cans/bottles will leave a permanent ring on the finish of this table. I'll keep it around until it falls apart (I'm thinking a year or two tops), but I'd never buy again. Might be ok if you put a glass top over it, but who wants to do that?"
2,horrible quality,"The lamp shade is fine, but the rest of the construction is rattly and cheap. Only three wheels touch the ground at a time because it's so poorly balanced. That's what you get for ""Made in China""."
3,french pop,"I think this cd is alright for French pop. It's a fun and upbeat version of classical French songs; an ecclectic collection. Some of the artists have done solo work, which is not great quality but it is amusing (ie Jean-Pascal)."
1,Even in America !,"I can't believe there is a Star academy album on amazon.com. I thought this really was a French phenomenon. I wouldn't like you to think this stands for french current pop music (at least for good one). I don't like the concept - those young people think they are singers and sing famous songs made by others. It is pretty much a crime in my opinion - most of these young boys and girls are not in voice yet (and most of them will never be, I tell you). What's more, I do not even enjoy the songs in themselves - they really sound like mainstream stuff and are not unforgettable. I'd advise you to avoid this and to go for real singers instead, I mean people who sing their OWN songs."
1,good in theory,"When I first heard of this, it amused me greatly. Then I paid for it and got to page where you download it and found out that it's a corrupt or invalid file. Don't buy this, it's a bust."
4,Sex and Lies on the Frontier,"Louise Barnett's Ungentlemanly Acts looks at the rather odd court martial of Andrew Geddes who goes on trial after accusing another officer of committing incest with his daughter. The author uses this case to examine nineteenth-century attitudes towards incest, including a look at the Byron - Harriet Beecher Stowe incident. There is also much discussion of life on the frontier, the court martial system in the army at the time, and an interesting discourse concerning the concept of viriginity. The book has many interesting detours such as these and they are necessary as the main story is not always as interesting or as siginificant to sustain a full book. All of the various pieces do come together to create a pleasant read."
4,An Accurate Historical Overview,"I thourougly enjoyed this book. The content is certainly not compromised by its small size. I am a college student and a history minor and this book is very accurate. It begins with a short history of colonial women and then delves into Ann Bailey's life. Lewis keeps the book interesting by including personal accounts and interviews with people who knew Ann Bailey. He also includes poems that were written about her. There are even maps in the back of the book. This book was written over a hundred years ago and that could have made it drab or dry, but this book was lively and full of great detail. Lewis is fantastic about using lots of vivid imagery and beautiful language to keep the reader drawn in. I highly recommend this book for reports or for anyone who is interested in learning more about Ann Bailey, or what life was like for colonial women."
4,a younger womens book,"i purchased this book because there was a forward by sara donati and i also like books about couragous women and in other centuries makes it even better. BUT im over 30 and this was just a little juvenile for me. it is a simple write and i must confess im a little spoiled by the sophistication of writers today as in miss donati, kate mosse, elizabeth kostova etc. i gave it 4 because i would have loved it when i was younger."
3,"it was,,,,",the book was entertaining and the auther did a good job letting the readers know about the situation during the war... however it was too easy of a read and the situations were expected. it was a good read but it could have been better...
3,"Worth watching,but not a great film","The only reason I enjoyed ""Bachelor Party Vegas"" is because I've been to Las Vegas so many times,and enjoyed the location of the film.There's alot of stupid scenes,but the movie does take you through an adventure these guys have,and Kathy Griffin is great as an Elvis thief.If you happen to come across this film on a boring night,check it out."
3,Kinda Lame,"I liked the movie bachelor party, but this one is kinda lame. Save your money and rent this one if you have to see it."
2,2.5 stars,"Most of the main characters in this are unknowns. The ""stars"" that are 2 of the main characters are Kal Penn and Donald Faison. The rest of the stars in this are more like cameo appearances mainly because this is one of those mass havok, the characters are always running from one extreme situation to another that are so far fetched that it takes the fun out of the movie. If the movie had more direction and wasn't so random, it would have been much better.There are some good actors in this but it's like they had no desire to be there.Chuck Liddell should not be acting. It is very clear in this. Stick to fighting.It has a few funny moments but not many. The out-takes are funnier than most of the movie. It is free to view on Crackle right now so I say preview it there and if you like it, buy it. It is a must have for a very select crowd.I love good, funny movies but this one really missed the mark."
3,"Twiggy Lawson and Tommy Tune, a winning combo","MY ONE AND ONLY features a Tony-winning performance from Tommy Tune with Twiggy Lawson singing the timeless standards of George and Ira Gershwin. 10 years later, another musical featuring Gershwin material would open on Broadway, CRAZY YOUR YOU, and would prove to be more successful. Still, MY ONE AND ONLY is an enjoyable musical and worthwhile cast album.True, Twiggy is a less-than-thrilling singer; still she has a feeling for the material and sings with a verve and spirit which makes up for her technical shortcomings. Tommy Tune is fine, but always comes across better in person than on disc. Standout numbers include ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"", ""S'Wonderful"", ""He Loves and She Loves"" and ""I Can't Be Bothered Now"".MY ONE AND ONLY lost out on the Best Musical Tony to CATS, and Twiggy lost out on the Best Actress Tony to Natalia Makarova (for the revival of ON YOUR TOES)."
5,Great musical,"I saw this show some 20 years ago on Broadway, and it was excellent. The music is beautiful, and timeless. It is time to bring it back to broadway for a revival."
1,Macromedia Flash Communication Server MX,"Over the past three years I have been working toward a Master degree in Software engineering. I have read many books introducing me to new languages and software. I really think the authors or publishers of this book should offer people who purchased this book a refund or a voucher for a free copy of a revised edition. This book is full of errors. You will spend most of your time looking at the book's website trying to review their corrections in effort to figure out how to complete the examples in the book.NewRider Press =""Buyer Beware"""
1,"yes, it's the only option, and nope, Definitely No Star !","I totally agree with other people's comment about the typos, errors, rush and skip-offs in the book. these are all true.btw, if you have to buy this book (why torture yourself ?) , at least wait until all the demo files (especially chatper 16) appear on the website, and let the erratas grow a bit longer, so you can skip all the head aches we had all been through. thanks kevin, nice job. you grow me a lot, really.oh yeah, also all the never-returned emails. all possible buyers can try this first, see if you ever get *any* reply."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"Don't believe the 5-star hype above about this book. I bought this book since it was the *only* source on flashcom and unfortunatly it currently still is. The code and examples presented are very rocky, full of errors and difficult to understand. I just about gotten half way through the book and I am utterly disgusted. Even though it may fill in a few blanks about flashcom, the fustration, confusion and frankly the price of the book is just not worth it.I feel foolish as I figured since I am a 7 year veteran of Flash and have extensive programming experience that I could hack through this book even though it had poor reviews. I thought perhaps it may be of some value to my study of flashcom. Boy was I wrong, its not even a decent reference.Don't support incompetent authors/publishers by shelling out your money for this one."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Unfortunately, this is the only book currently available on this promising new product from Macromedia. To be fair, it filled in some blanks for me. But if you buy it, be prepared to spend more time debugging the code in the book than your own code. It's full of errors and typos. And contrary to promises, none of them have been corrected or acknowledged on the book's web site. This book was obviously rushed into print with little proof reading or testing of the code. Let's hope some of the other books that are in the pipeline are better."
1,Stay away from this one...,It's not a good book.Its exercises are full with errors.Plus its website companion is no longer accessable.I wonder why...really wasted my money!!
1,not for programmers,"This book is good for getting the basics on flash communication server, and for using the pre-installed UI components, but does not go into detail on how to program custom applications, they pretty much expect you to use the pre-installed UI components, which is pretty crappy.I highly recommend getting the O'Reilly book instead, I just picked it up and its WAYYYYYYYYYY better. It's called ""programming flash communication server""."
3,It's OK,"I got this as a present for my husband. It's smaller than I thought it would be, but since it's for his office that ok."
2,Whatever Condition,"We liked the speed of the order processing, acknowledgement, email status updates and the delivery when promissed.We did not like like the finish irregularities on the black frame of the clock: it looked like residual shinny varnish on an otherwise flat black surface. We also did not like the fact that the clock would not run consistently. We changed batteries. Still it would not run consistently. To avoid the hastle to sending it back, we bought another clock mechanism locally and repaired it at our own expense.Our Whatever Clock now works fine. So: good order; unsatisfactory product."
4,Funny little clock,I bought this as a gift so I can't comment on how it works. It's a funny gift that was well received. I took off one star because the price for this was a little high. You can buy the clock movement part for a dollar or two. I wouldn't pay $20.00 if I was buying for myself.
4,a little small,"Nice clock, but it's a little small! I expected a bigger one! and the color is darker than the picture."
3,The battery place was broken,When I went to place the battery one of the contacts was broken. It took me a while to place the battery. I was very disappointed since this was for a gift. I didn't have time to send it back
5,Tick tock,"Haven't had any problems with this clock, which was placed in the kitchen of my sisters house. I wouldn't suggest using it to time when you're cooking meal though, it's kinda of hard to guesstimate where the time is haha."
1,Whatever wall clock,I purchased this clock for my art studio where I usually lose track of time. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ceramic tile insert with the numbers. It is definitely for someone who has grown up with a clock with a face. The young digital crowd would have trouble telling time with it. Judy
4,Whatever wall clock,"Nice clock, only I expected it to be little bigger, but still I like it. It can be a good present for a friend!"
3,3.5 for Something new (to me),"To start off i would give this 4 stars if this box set was worth more than the ""save"" set which is 13 dollars less and sold on amazon! go figure... any who.Well this is definitely an adult anime, uh maybe a little too adult if you ask me. Sometimes curse words just get used to make the show seem more mature; and the chauvinistic sexuality gets a little annoying at times but the show manages to carry on through the really dumb parts to actually be somewhat refreshing in the homogenized world of anime.If you can enjoy a piece of life anime where the main character is battling a chronic masturbation addiction then this one is for you. Definitely not saying that is a (good) reason to like it."
2,thought it was gonna be awesome but ...,As the 1st episode start u think its gonna b zaney crazy over the top and as u continue to watch u realize it is not . I still gave this show achance and was ultimately disappointed as the series continued . This show begins to make very little sense and falls apart more and more as it progresses . Its not the worst anime ive seen but its far from even bn close to the best ... peace my ninjas
3,For diehard fans,"This collection of performances from a 1980 Los Angeles engagement will probably be appreciated most by the diehard Knight fan for it's inclusion of lesser known favorites like ""Still Such A Thing"", ""Bourgie Bourgie"" and ""Taste of Bitter Love"". The liner notes, which describe Knight's appeal with perception (and include rare photos), claim these selections were culled from five nights of performances. However, the fatigue in Kinght's voice, which the discerning fan will hear, makes one wonder if this were perhaps the last show on the last night. The concert isn't Gladys Knight & The Pips at their live best, but it has its moments. Listen for audience members Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick to join Gladys briefly on ""Landlord"". The somewhat obscure disco-era ""You Bring Out The Best In Me"" may be a plus for some listeners."
3,Something of a disappointment............,After owning one of the early DSS cordless phones made by another manufacturer I expected this 'state of the art' phone to be even better regarding signal carry but whereas the old phone worked for unbelievable distances this one breaks up in my back yard.
1,Flaw design,"I bought this one (KX-TG5576) to replace my old panasonic cordless phones (6 years), because the handset was broken into pieces. Since I had so much good experience with the company; I decided to get another one from panasonic. At the beginning, I loved this phone, it had all the features I needed and I could personalize the ringing tones and the displays. But right after the warranty period had run out, the handset died (handset lost link to base and speaker phone on the handset died). I didn't bother to fix it, so I got another model (KX-TG5571); one year later, the handset died again with the same problem. Then I bought another one from Panasonic, which died again now with the same problem. So it seemed that Panasonic has intentionally designed their products this way, so that they can continuously earn profit from their customers.If you want to get a phone for extended life, don't buy Panasonic; unless you just want to enjoy the cool features."
3,Very strange....,"Panasonic's website has no information on this phone. The KX-TG57XXX series phone seems to be the most current model. I do have the KX-TG5576M and it works fine. The ""missed call"" issue(previously discussed) is annoying as I have two other handsets and must clear them all."
5,Nice Phone,This phone is well worth the price. Phone and answering machine both work great. Phone holds a good charge for a few days without being hung up. Great product. Would highly recomend.
4,Panasonic KX-TG5576M Talking Phone,"I really like the phone, however, the talking feature that lets me know who's calling is not very clear and is low so I can't really hear who's calling from another room which is the main reason I bought this phone. Also, the ringer volume is not as high as I would like it to be. I do, however, like the answering machine feature and the fact that you can put pictures in so that whoever is calling, their picture shows up."
5,Panasonic Phone,"This is simply the finest and most versatile phone we have ever had. With cell phones taking over, this is the best choice for a home phone. We have had it since they came out and have now replaced it with another as the numbers finally wore off. You can add your own tone and display photo and add up to 6 remote phones.Thanks Panasonic!"
3,Build it in the USA,"The product has some unique features, but the instruction manual ia pooly written. It needs to be written by a group skilled in instruction manual writing in English.The Display window for the answerer is up too high. Makes the ""O""'s look like ""U""'s"
5,Informative and helpful in learning to sail,"I found the video to be quite useful in learning how to sail, prior to going out on the water in a sailboat. I purchased a used Hobie Cat 16 without any sailing experience and found the video to be a useful aid in learning the fundamentals of sailing prior to going out on the water in my boat."
5,Excellent Video for Victory 21 Sailors,"This is an excellent video. Because the Rainbow 24 used in the video is so similar in both appearance and rigging to the Victory 21, new Victory 21 sailors can benefit greatly from this video."
3,Every DVD I watch adds to my knowledge,"I admit, I am a sailing junky. So I like to watch everything I can. I learned some good things from this program. But I definitely feel the bit on heavy weather was confusing and a slightly wishy washy. I have the Pardey's Storm tactic DVD and that was definitely more confidence building. For enjoyable reasons to go cruising I like the programs put on by the Shards. But as I said in the beginning. This is worth a watch, especially for real beginners."
3,Capsizing with confidence,"Somehow this DVD reminded me the PBS programs with Bob Ross, I think it was called Joy of Painting. Both share the same happy 1980's feel to them. But while Bob Ross and his trees are amusing and educational, this one is neither. In fact it is quite confusing and busy piece of work. The shortcomings are many, and you will most definetely capsize should you follow the advice on how to jibe in heavy weather. In fact they filmed people capsizing, presumably following that very advice.The only reason to watch is a lack of better options, which in itself isn't a bad reason.3 stars, mostly for nice footage of Lake George."
2,Dead Link for Russian Song,"Unfortunately, the link ([...] to the Russian song (Koni Priveredlivye ""Fastidious Horses"" by Vysockij Vladimir), appears to be dead... it has been many years. I've been looking all over online and can't find this song anywhere that I can download it. As for the rest of the White Nights soundtrack... never bought it... most of the songs I loved in the movie were NOT on the soundtrack (which ONLY had 10 songs on it... even in the days of LPs, that was pretty poor!)"
3,A few worthwhile tracks,"The bulk of this album is forgettable, cheesy 80s pop. But if the price is right, it's worth buying for the included tracks from Robert Plant and John Hiatt, and to a lesser extent those from Roberta Flack and Lou Reed. On the other hand, if you're the kind of person who actually enjoys inspid love songs from the likes of Phil Collins, then you might just love this album."
4,Bought it for the Plant song,"I didn't see the movie and I don't know anything about the Russian song that was omitted from the album. I bought this soundtrack for ""Far Post"", a truly amazing Robert Plant tune. To my knowledge this song was only previously available as the B-side to the ""Big Log"" vinyl 45. In my opinion, this is Robert Plant's best song as a solo artist, and if I have to buy an entire movie soundtrack to have it on CD, it's still well worth it."
2,The Horses,The soundtrack was ok. I was really upset that the Vladamir Vysotsky song was not on the soundtrack. Where can I find the Vladamir Vysotsky song? It is called The Horses or Fastidious Horses. I would like the same version that is in the movie.
2,where is the russian song?,"In this age and time one would not expect to cut out one of the most meaningful songs, in mood with the movie, just because it was sung in Russian. It's a pity (the same on the LP)."
4,A FABULOUS CD!!,I LOVE this CD! I listen to it when I exercise. it was my favorite of the Christmas presents I got last year! The only songs that are missing are Fatidous Horses and Say You Say Me. i really wish those two songs were on the CD but I love the CD anyway. I was really suprise to see that The Tapdance song is on the CD. If you loved the movie get the CD!!!!
4,"US navy seals, glossary+great book","This book was sort of a glossary, combined with a book of stories. It had alot of definitions inside, along with stories, which made it seem like it was more of a dictionary for Navy Seals. This book was still an interesting book, and a good book to read, although I was mislead, I thought it was more of a story book.I wasn't dissapointed by this book, it was still fun, and grabbing. I would give this book 4 stars because it wasn't exactly what type of book I was looking for, but was still a book I would recomend to people that have a slight interest in military topics."
4,an ok book about the SEALs,I found it an informative book. However I found some mistakes in it. They confuesed the HK P9 for the HK P7. they also called the M4 A CAR-15. other than that is was a good book.
2,Duane,I have been trying to find a bug and tar cleaner that really works and so I thought I would take a chance and order it. The Blue Magic Road Tar and Bug Gel does not work well. I use alot of arm power and yet this product still leaves much of the bug and tar residue on the front of my vehicle.
5,Buying for years,"I have been buying Blue Coral Bug & Tar for many years now. It's the easiest to work with and does a fine job getting off the nasties. Sometimes you need to let it soak ""the bug"" for a minute or two and then wipe clean. But most times, one small drop and away goes the guts !!!"
4,Nice but Noisey,This HP Officejet 5610 all-in-one is a great item. It's clarity is very nice the only downfall is it is noisey when it is printing and faxing. Great price value for this item.
4,Just Awsome,This printer is just awesome ....easy to use and the printing quality is amazing.Not only that its copy function is also really good.Copies even better then the original copy.I recommend everyone to buy this printer.
4,perfect for home office,"$130...seems like a great value and it is. No problems whatsoever with the machine. The default settings will sometimes give you a fax with lines down the paper, but just change the settings and it's perfectly clear. Definitely recommend this machine to anyone who wants to do everyday activity and doesn't need to scan with extremely high quality (takes forever if it needs to be a high quality scan)."
2,Driver too large,"The driver for this printer is 163, yes, 163mb. See their web site. Driver for the Canon Pixma is 10.3mb."
2,HP printer/scanner/copier/fax,"It is a fine machine unless you have Windows Vista as we do! There is an insert with instructions and a special CD to use however we still can't get the FAX to work. With scanning if you have Vista you have to go into the Paint program to scan which is bizarre! If you use Vista, I would avoid this product and get one that is compatible!"
1,Piece of Crap!,"What a piece of Crap!! We used this unit only periodically, so I had changed the cartridges only once before this unit crapped out. Some sort of '0x' error message on the unit's front panel. HP has all sorts of reset codes & procedures to try to reboot the firmware, but it didn't matter.In dealing with HPs' customer service and eventually being assigned to case managers, they pretty much told me I was crap-out-of-luck. Guy was kinda rude to me too, but that's another story."
1,Bad Software,The new software for the Vista operating system is a real headache. The all in one uninstalles randomly and the patch they came up with won't work.
2,"Ok with XP, horrible with Vista","Purchased this printer May, 2007. Vista driver wasn't available until 1 1/2 mos later so I used it on my XP machine until then. Setup was easy except in the attempt to dummy-proof the installaiton wizard, you have no idea how to tell it not to answer calls coming into the fax line. After installation, even though I set the default printing preference to ""fast draft"", it would randomly print in normal mode. Ink cartridges are tiny. So, they don't last very long. After the Vista driver was available, I connected it to my Vista machine. Print speed was terrible. It takes 2-4 minutes to print 1 page. Sometimes, the print dialogue would just hang for a minute or so. HP support had no plans in place to fix the driver. I returned the printer."
2,inability to RECEIVE faxes--can send without trouble,"I have contacted Tech.Support at least 15 times--have a case No. but nobody appears to know what is wrong-test faxes have been sent by me and returned without a problem,but OUTSIDE faxes I cannot receive--EXCEPT on an eccentric basis--usually only in the evening, after 6:00PM, but then not always--can verify because I have a duplicate e-mail sent each time so I can check--these faxes are essential to my financial business and I'm losing money because I don't get them. Have ""distinctive ring"" feature in desperation but even THAT doesn't work--calls keep going over to my land line phone instead of being picked up by machine.Have tried to get supervisor and demand a NEW machine to replace this one--but nobody ever calls back. The mostly heavy Indian accent doesn't help either!!I'm desperate, but don't seem to get any help at all."
2,Great at first...,"Before I bought this printer I researched for months, trying to get the best deal of an All-in-One printer. One reason is so I can get cheap ink with a good amount that will last a while. First problem is that even if you buy 58 hp photo ink it won't print color unless you buy 22 hp color in cartridge. 22 does not have as much ink in the cartridge and is almost $20 for only 5 ml of ink! I decided to play it safe and buy the 1 year protection thing. The gadget was working fine until one day my computer claimed there was not a scanner connected. I thought perhaps I needed to install the software again. Then I put new ink in and it needs to scan the alignment page to align everything. The scanner will not work at all and I have no idea why. I've had this printer for not even 2 years and it won't scan anymore. Now, I'm starting my new printer search and not sure to look for separate machines or get another multifunctional one and risk the same problem happening again."
2,officejet 5610 all-in-one,"HP Officejet 5610 All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier (Q7311A#ABA)The printer/scanner/copier/fax works well, but the ad clearly stated that it was compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se,me,nt, 2000, xp, and vista. It is not. When it arrived, it said on the box it was NOT compatible with 95, 98, 98se, me, or nt. Unfortunately, I chose it because I was running windows me. Since it was the second one I had bought (the first one at the recommendation of HP, which I had to return for the same reason) I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to xp. So after an additional $100, I finally got the thing to work. Sort of. It will not scan an image to the computer from paper while online. The fax hangs up when it feels like it. And it doesn't hold much paper. But since it sort of works, (better than my computer now) I guess I will keep it. Shipping was fast, but DO NOT buy this if you don't have at MINIMUM windows 2000."
3,A little disappointed,I bought my original HP 5610 about 1.5 years ago. Shortly after I bought it when it was printing it would pause before the printing was complete. After about 20-30 seconds it would finish. I took it back and got another one. After a month or so same thing happened. I am now going to take it back and get something different. It is a good machine but frustrating when you are trying to print.....
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had so many problems with this model. HP replaced it once because they were too stupid to diagnose that the power pack/cord was bad, I told them it was but they replaced the whole unit. Now the new one has paper jams all the time or won't load the paper at all. The unit has been a total dissapointment. I've got an older HP all-in-one and it is full of sawdust from the shop and it has never failed!"
4,Functions well,"Functions very well. Starts right away and funtions more cleanly than the Epson we had. We had an HP before, then tried Epson. This one is so much better."
2,caution not ethernet capable,Had to return. We were replacing the model that was one step up. We use the printer with several laptops in the house and it has no ethernet connection to use with a home wireless setup.
3,Color Ink Cartridge Scam,The printer/scanner works fine but very unhappy about the cartridge scam they pulled on this unit. Mechanically the unit was designed to use the 57 or 22 Color cartridges as their other printers in this family - the 57 containing almost 4 times the amount of ink. However on this model they modified the software to not accept the 57 cartridge forcing users to buy the 22 cart leading much higher costs per color print.
4,Good Choice For The $$,"The 5610 may not be the fastest thing on 4 wheels but for the money, it is a good choice. If you need an all-in-one for your home this will fit the bill."
4,OFFICEJET 5610,"FOR THE MOST PART I REALLY LIKE THE 5610.IT WAS VERY EASY TO SET UP AND INSTALL.PRINTING IS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.THE SCANNER IS A LITTLE ON THE SLOW SIDE ,BUT THAT COULD BE BECAUSE I USE AN OLDER COMPUTER.I DON'T KNOW.BUT ALL IN ALL IT IS A VERY CONVIENT AND A GOOD DEAL FOR THE MONEY."
2,Not Going with HP because of review and history,"I was looking at purchasing an HP printer because it's ""what I've always done"". However, the last 2 HP laptops I purchased were bad experiences...maybe user, maybe not. Please bear with me since this is not a printer tale so much as an HP tale. The first HP laptop was refurbished and started encountering problems from the start. When the 2nd started out much the same and was brand new, I went round and round with tech support. First with HP, then Kodak and Microsoft. The recurring theme was 'this is a known compatibility issue with HP'. I immediately traded the laptop for a Sony Vaio and have never looked back. I was considering buying an HP printer because of familiarity and they seem to easily match up with other brands. The previous review has changed my mind. I will look at Canon or something else to be safer from repeated bad experiences. Thank you."
1,NOTWHATIGOT!,I ordered the HP Officejet 5610 all-in-one printer. What I recieved was an HP Officejet 5750. Not what I ordered. Need I say more?
4,Price-worthy,"Excellent product...so far no troubles...UPS did not reach me telling that I was not available, where as I didn't get any notice and got information only after checking the site for delay. Then I had to go and collect. About the product it is doing its duty well."
4,HP All In One,"I never rate anything a 5 - there's always room for improvement. So far, I have few complaints about this piece of equipment. I haven't had a moment to print pictures/photography which is why I chose a bit more pricey model than I would have just to print documents. It's quick, gives me plenty of options, the fax is great and doesn't interfere with my answering machine - and so far I have used the copier function a lot more than I had anticipated. The only hitch is the feeder for the copier - tends to get things a little crooked. But that's to be expected. Even office copiers have that issue. All in all, I would recommend this for anyone's home office."
3,Just right,It works fine. Except that it does make one feel that it is fragile too....Use it right and it will work fine. I dont think it can be used for high volumes.The cord is its biggest flaw.
2,Printer Cartridge Jams,This is the second HP OfficeJet printer I have purchased and both have done the same thing- the printer cartridge jams after only printing one page and you must reset it to continue printing- for it to only happen again and again.I returned the previous model for the same reason. That only took 2 months to malfunction. Thinking HP is a really good brand and I had bad luck- I thought to get a better model.I'll be looking for a different all in one machine in the near future.
2,Major Disappointment,"I was excited to buy this all-in-one printer after I read the reviews of this product. Well, needless to say, after many hours on the phone with HP's customer support, we could not get it to receive faxes. If you have a digital answering machine and distinctive rings on your phone, don't bother buying this machine. IT WILL NOT WORK! Also, the scanner portion doesn't do as good a job as my old HP stand-alone scanner that's 10 yrs. old. Too bad HP couldn't come up with a fix for the faxing part. I ended up returning this machine. HP told me to buy the Model #7410 for $450 if I wanted to receive faxes. What's up with that?"
3,"HP Officejet 5610 All-in-One Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax","OfficeJet 5610 works well and will do the job of the broken Officejet all-in-one it replaces. My only complaint is how long it takes to install the printer. HP, again fills your computer with driver after driver and junk you will never use in most cases. When your done there will be default crap that will take your time to get rid of. IT JUST SHOULDN'T BE THIS WAY."
5,Very Satisfied,I yes the printer for home use only and have used all the functions without any difficulty whatsoever. I can honestly say I didn't even have to open the manual. Print quality is very good.
1,BEWARE: Labels & Business Card Printing on HP 5610,"BEWARE. This printer has one MAJOR design flaw: The print rollers slip on special paper such as Business Cards or any kind of labels. HP has 2 ""Workarounds"" but for it but neither fixes the problem. They only address the slippage at the top of the page but do not address the constant slippage throughout the rest of the page. I bought 2 of these printers for my business but can't print my business cards, mailing labels, or any other labels. BTW, very poor client service; once I mentioned the ""workarounds"" not working they stop responding. Selling printers on Ebay. BEWARE"
5,"HP officejet 5610 all in one printer, copier, scanner, fax","Value driven product, little deuce coupe of the printers; will be a valuable home office asset for years to come, it does it all."
4,Great printer!,"This all-in-one replaced a fax, an obsolete Epson color printer and a Canon personal copier. I have saved all kinds of counter space. So far it works just fine. Good copies and good scans also. I am impressed with this machine, and the price was way below what I paid for everything that I just got rid of.I trust that HP will be there if something goes wrong. I am using it with my new iMac with Leopard OS. I set it up quickly with no issues."
5,"Great Combination Printer, Scanner & Fax!!","This is a great Printer and very easy to use. I purchased it primarily for the Fax Machine, but will also use it for it's printer function as well."
5,HP office Desk jet,This is the greatest piece of equipment that I have. I love it!!Roxann HillGecko Girl
2,It's just OK,This printer is ok if you just need to do basic printing.I bought it from best buy 2 months ago to print cd labels and other labels.the printer can not line up the labels correctly.There is also something weird about having to put the labels in face down. I used the fax machine feature and it worked ok. I also printed out some web pages and that was ok. the quality of the printing is fine it's just that you can't do any precision work.I would not buy this printer and in fact i am trying to figure out how to get rid of mine without losing to much money. then again i guess i can always just use it as a fax machine.
5,Easy,"I am very happy with my purchase - it was a gift for my son , it was perfect having it shipped directly to him at school, and the product itself has worked out very nicely."
5,"HP Officejet 5610 All-in-One Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax","This is a great product at a reasonable price. It is nice too have a reliable product that can scan, print, copy, and fax and have it all in one unit."
5,Cool Product!!,"FAST, MANY OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM, SCANS/FAX/PRINT REALLLLY WELLHIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT (if you're looking for a efficient printer)SHIPPING FROM AMAZON, FAST & ARRIVED ON A HOLIDAY (via. UPS)A+++++++++++++++*********~\-/ o w i E!~*********"
2,HP All-in-one Printer,"Excellent copies and photographs. Clear, clean copies. Quick. However, unit kept saying it had a paper jam, and proceded to clank and clatter. Merely lift the lid and the clanking and clatter stopped. The imaginary paper jam was cleared. We gave this unit away and purchased another HP printer."
2,Cartridge Jam,"Worked great for the first year and a half. Now the cartridge jams after every printed page. I have replaced the ink cartridges, but the problem persists. Very annoying problem."
4,Not Airport Express compatible,I have a Macintosh desktop and laptop. I just recently added an Airport Express wireless router and found out that my HP 5610xi is not compatible with my Airport Express. I'm now back to switching the USB for the 5610xi between my laptop and desktop anytime I need to print or scan. There are no apparent updates to this issue on the HP website. So if printing through your Macintosh Airport Express wireless setup isn't important than this All-in-one will get the job done. Otherwise carefully consider another option that will be compatible.
4,HP Officejet All-in-One,"This may be the best value on an all in one printer, scanner, fax and copier anywhere. It's fast, quiet, easy to set up and prints/copies great!"
2,"Good for 17 months, then scanner fried","Bought in December 2005. Great performance until last week (May 2007). Scanner suddenly started making lines. No fix available. Ended up costing me only about $9 per month, but I had higher expectations."
2,officejet 5610,"i love this item, but the first one i bought did not work, so i sent it back and in 2 days i got the same product that works great. thank you. i love the fact that i can print,copy,scan and fax all in one. thank you so much, dave"
1,Huge Disappointment,"Unable to get Officejet to advance beyond stage one of setup phase. Called Tech Support. Spent one hour with a rep on the phone as well as one hour with another rep online. The Officejet came in an inoperable state. Very disappointing! Has to repackage and return. What a nuisance. Went to local electronics store and bought a cheaper printer other than HP. Much better quality, ease of use, and price."
1,Installation Nightmare,"I can't tell you how many hours I have spent trying to install the software. I have tried every suggestion I can find online. Installation fails but the printer function works. At least print quality is decent. Scan function won't work because of screwed up installation. Tried download from HP, same problems. I can't believe it's this difficult. Won't buy an HP next time around, which may be soon if I throw this thing out the window."
1,Not very forgiving,Inserted the print cartridge into wrong slot. Could not remove it. Had to send product back. Had to purchase 3 year warranty. A good deal turned into a I paid too much for this. Should have stuck with Lexmark
2,Slow as molasses,Do not buy this printer for any point of sale activity. It prints very slowly even on the draft setting. The machine also eats toner ink quite fast. Outside of that I guess it is alright.
4,Good for the home or home office.,"I have not used all the features as advertized. But I have used the printing, copying, and faxing options and the printer works as promised!"
1,Software install is full of bugs,I tried for 3 hours to get this thing working. It took 3 installs and uninstalls to get to where it would even finsih installing. Then when it finally did the software said it could not communicate with the scanner. Microsoft software could see and controll the scanner. The web site support said uninstall and install the software. No thanks not another 3 hours.Find an different one this one is no good at least on my computer. A vaio desktop with XP SP2.
4,Good price,"I picked this printer because it had the features I wanted and the price was right. I have not gotten it in use as yet, but will soon. I am sure it will be a great buy."
2,"Thumbs down, HP 5610","I've appreciated my HP printers in the past, but this modelHP Officejet 5610 All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier (Q7311A#ABA)seems wonky and breaks down at a pin drop. I've had three in the past 2 years, each returned for major problems, and now the bulb has gone out on the third. No more for me, thanks."
2,Works well for a while,"Like others have mentioned, it does well in all categories...then the paper jams start and you are out looking for another printer. I had it since 2/06 and it went out 4/07 and have only gone thru one cycle of cartridges."
2,I don't like it,"I've had this machine for about six months and find it very difficult to load the paper, plus it jams on a regular basis. Another annoyance is that you must remove the output tray to load the input tray. Even if you just want to insert one sheet of paper to say for instance print on the back of it you have to take out the output tray and then it takes too much time trying to insert that one sheet just right. Most of all I hate that I can not for all the world cancel a print project. Bring up the printer software and try to cancel that print job and it simply will not go away. Even after turning off the printer and the computer the next day when I turn them back on that sucker will go right ahead printing and wasting ink on the unwanted print job. For once I'm glad these things never last more than a few years because I won't be sorry to see this one die. I dread having to print anything because of the fact that only one in three jobs go well. The more I use it the more I hate it."
1,junk,"I have had this 4in1 for a week now and have spent over 16 hours on line with HP and still can't get everything to work . If you are wondering why the operating program is so large for a printer ,it is because of all the spyware/ help loaded . I am not alone ,go to the HP site and read some of those reviews."
1,Broke after 4 months - It's cheap in more ways than one,"My 5610 is used in an office environment that sees about 2 faxes a week and it is used to send about 1 fax a week. After 3 months of this very light load, the unit no longer feeds off the top tray without complaining of a paper jam. So we started to revert to using the flatbed for scanning outbound faxes. About a month later the unit has started complaining that is has the wrong paper size loaded, no amount of panel configuration or resetting the device seems to be able to change its mind. As a result it will not print anything.The frustration is not worth it, no matter how ""cheap"" the unit is.8/2009Just an update on my review. I did eventually contacted HP and they shipped me a new unit. The replacement has been operating for 2 years (only used for sending faxes) without a problem."
4,Love My HP,"The HP5610 is a great efficient tool for in the home or at the office use. It came in A-1 condition and in a timely fashion. The product could have gotten a five star review from me, but the advertisement never told me that it did not come with a USB cable, so I had to go out and buy one before I could start scanning or printing directly from my PC."
2,HP Chat Support is Inept,"I would love to be able to tell you about how great this printer is but after 5 (so far) attempted installs of the software to run the printer I am still online chatting with tech support in Malasia or wherever it is trying to get it to function properly. I initially had the printer functionality working, but now I can't even get the printer to work. The last set of instructions were so convoluted that I am sure most folks including myself will screw them up somewhere and will eventually have to reload their operating system because of the ineptitude of the HP tech support.If you can get the printer and software up and running you may have a great printer. Otherwise, buyer beware!"
1,Couldn't Download Software for New Printer,"I purchased my HP Officejet 5610 on 2/28/2007, and it took me a over a week (hours!) before I was able in download the software and use it. I continued to receive an error message ""The copy function cannot be used"". The same thing happened with the HP printer I previously used at home. HP support was quick with providing responses but unfortunately the steps provided were not exactly what I had to do to successfully complete this task. My next personal printer will not be an HP!"
4,Great all in one little product!,"It's a great product at a great price. Doesn't take up much space and the quality of the copies are very good. It has a lot of extra features, I especially like the automatic feed since my older FAX machine didn't have this. You don't have to babysit all the papers going in. Be aware that the rollers make some noise, and in order to receive FAXes, the machine has to be on; and there is no memory to hold FAXes until you turn the machine on. Overall, I am very happy with this product."
2,My review,"This item came with a very complicated CD disk. I have had a computer since 1986 and have never seen a more complicated CD software. The instruction manuel is a complete waste of time to read, too!!!"
4,Good printer/scanner/fax....,"It's got good speed printing, scanning is ok (quicker than my old Lexmark), fax is quicker as well. Print runs out ridiculously quick which is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5, but good unit for the price."
4,"HP Officejet 5610 All-in-One Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax","I bought this unit for my staff to use. We don't have the scanner connected to the network, but the fax seems to work fine and it copies as well as most people need.HP Officejet 5610 All-in-One Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax"
4,Great device...could be better,"Simply put, I have had this all-in-one for about 5 years now and I have NEVER had a problem with it. I have used it for printing, faxing, scanning and copying and every time it worked out just the way I needed it to. The only way it could be better is if it had wireless.....alls well that ends ok."
4,Great for the money,"It was only $100. I don't expect high-end functionality. But I was impressed. Setup was easy. Even the software installed on WinXP the first time and functioned like the manual says it should. The OCR function of the scanning software was especially cool.The only real knock might be the paper tray. It seems kind of clunky sticking out the side, but I've learned to ignore it. The noise does not bother me, nor does the lag time to do certain things. Very happy."
4,HP Officejet 5610 Good Printer at a great price,I shopped around for a printer before settling on this one. it has all the features of a typical all-in-one and granted I've yet to use all the features but it has performed very well so far. Sometimes though the printing is slow and I haven't yet determined why. Other times it spits the documents right out. Best priced printer with decent quality in the market. I haven't tried printing photos yet but that should be the truest test.
3,HP Officejet 5610,"I've owned a HP Officejet 5610 for a number of years, and what most reviews say is accurate. It's a good solid all in one printer that doesn't breakdown easy, but it's not good for printing photos, the color comes out off, and the slippage of the paper rules out any precision printing, such as business cards, envelopes, pictures (with smaller sheets). Otherwise it's a good all in one printer. When I got mine the price was much lower, at today's prices I wouldn't get one."
1,A PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"BEWARE! THIS THING IS THE INK GUZZLER OF ALL TIME! Continuous ""Cartridge error"" messages before\after ink cartridge replacements! AAAAAAAAAAARGH! A POS!"
5,worth every dollar,"what can I say? It prints, faxes, copies, and scans just fine. The quality of each is very good, not great. But at around $100, you are not going to find more bang for your buck.Running it on a Dell laptop with Office 2007, and has handled every print job I've sent so far."
4,printer,I think the product has very good quality for the price . I wish I hadn't waited so long to make this purchase .
2,Loud,"Colors were not crisp, but my main complaint would be the noise that it makes, this is my first HP product and i dont think i would buy another one."
4,HP printer,I have found the HP printer to be excellent. It prints quite quickly. The copy function works well. I am very satisfied.
2,Good for a while...these things are disposable?,"Works great out of the box. Easy to set up, easy to use. This printer eats through ink cartridges as if that's what it were made to do. Hmmmmm.After a while, it just starts jamming up. I have to wrestle each page away from it's deathly grip, wait for it to give me the error message, then it forces me to press the ""OK"" button to go on printing the next page. Is it ok?? Where's the ""just for once I'd like to buy an HP product that lasts over 13 months"" button?"
3,Macs Beware! Not Compatible w/Airport!!,"My Epson died on me and I decided to try an HP printer. I chose this one because the price was right and it had the features I wanted - fax/printing/copying. After hooking everything up, I must have spent a good two hours on the phone with HP trying to get it to be wireless only to be told after the fact that it wasn't compatible with Mac's Airport. So now I'm stuck with the printer, which is a great printer, but it totally makes the point of having a laptop and wireless capability useless. Otherwise, it's great on ink, easy to hook up and the printing quality is fine. I'm giving it 3 stars because I would NOT have purchased this particular printer had I known it wouldn't work with my Airport Express (and believe me, the help desk tried all kinds of things to help me set it up)."
4,Love this printer,"Wow, for a fax-printer-copier-scanner machine, this is an excellent bargain. Additionally, the software that comes with it does a fabulous job, as the images are crisp and clear. The only downfall is the price of the ink, which is cheaper if you order it directly from HP."
1,I will NEVER Buy another HP printer,"This printer has been an absolute nightmare. We wanted an all in one so we wouldn't have so many machines in our office. Well when you try to print something it stops halfway and you can't get it to finish printing without shutting down your pc and the printer and rebooting everything. This might work if you're lucky. We've called HP several times to no avail. They seem to have no idea what the problem is because they've had us try all sorts of nonsence that doesn't work. They were absolutely no help. I could get a realiable printer for the fraction of the cost and that's what I intend to do. We've stuck with this printer for so long because of the cost, but I just can't take it anymore."
1,HP ALL IN ONE PRINTER,"WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE SERVICE FOR PURCHASING THIS PRODUCE STINKS, I HAVE NEVER RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AND THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE 3RD TIME I TRIED TO BUY SUCH A PRODUCT. EACH TIME I TRIED TO BUY FROM A SELLER SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND EITHER THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED BEFORE SHIPPING OR IT WAS SHIPPED AND NEVER RECEIVED. I TRIED HAVING IT SHIPPED TO MY P.O. BOX AND MY PHYSICAL ADDRESS AND TO THIS DATE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED MY PURCHASE. TO THIS TELLS ME THAT THE SELLERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED IN SELLING THEIR PRODUCT. SO IN THIS REVIEW I WOULD GIVE IT A ZERO IN RATING AND I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING AGAIN FROM AMAZON WHO HAS A SELLER."
1,Out of the box - doesn't work,"Right out of the box, it doesn't work. Printer allignment fails - talked to HP support, but their instructions don't work either. Tried following instructions in the manual, but the menus don't seem to agree with what I see on the screen. I'd like to send it back."
3,"Nice price, quality issues?","I bought the produce because of my belief in HP products, not to mention the great bang-for-the-buck (which I thought was great).Unfortunately the first one I received did not work properly. Everything it printed was angled upward from left to right. HP support kind of dragged their feet about swapping it out. Fortunately Amazon swapped it with no questions asked. The second unit has worked properly and I am pleased with it thus far."
2,Not Good with a MAC,"I thought the actual print quality was very good, but that's not why I bought this unit. I need to be able to scan directly to my word processing program and this machine cannot do that. Despite what it says on the box about OCR capabilities, and ability to work with Mac OS X, it NO LONGER includes the OCR software with the machine. There is a READIRIS software registration form included in the packaging, but according to the HP Tech line they don't offer it any longer. The software would cost an additional $129 online, or $129 plus tax/shipping etc. I returned the machine."
1,HP Has a New Racket. Why Fix It When They Can Get You To Pay For A New One?,"HP is running a racket. If you have an issue and call their support line, they tell you that ""this is a problem that will probably continue to occur in the future"" and then they recommend that you therefore replace your device with a newer, more expensive unit (which they'll give you a ""discount"" on if you buy directly from them).After declining this ""sales pitch"" I went to their website support and found that the problem was merely a driver that had somehow gotten uninstalled and needs to be re-installed.No more HP for me."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Ordered this machine impulsively when my old HP T45 began to sound like a machine version of the 'death rattle.' It was a amistake. Poor scanning, slow printing, ink eating and- overall - a truly inferior product. I returned it and bought a Canon Pixma MP530 for about $60 more and am VERY pleased with it. I believe that HPs heyday as the premiere maker of domestic printers and multi-function machines is over.Don't do what I did - Home work first, THEN purchase!"
1,Worst printer I've ever bought,"I bought this as a replacement for an old Epson all-in-one that performed well for years, but had the famous Epson ink guzzling issue.Scans for this All-in-One have been blurry and with poor resolution. The resultant scans are unusable.The printer prints OK in black but use of colored ink results in bleeding and blurring, even within the same document and on high quality paper.Although it says it works with HP '56' cartridges, it gives a cartridge error message when installing one. 22 and 27 cartridges are accepted.All in all, this is going in the trash."
1,Do not buy,Cheap construction. Extremely bad design changing print cartridges. Every HP product I've ever purchased has been sub-standard. Salesman said this one was soooo good & I bought it against my better judgement. No HPs ever again.
4,Hilton channels Christie,"From the Dover edition: ""Was It Murder?"" like ""Goodbye Mr. Chips,"" takes place in that most traditional and confounding of English settings, the public school. Colin Revell, impudent Oxonian and sometime sleuth, returns to his alma mater Oakington to puzzle over a schoolboy's ""accidental"" death. The accidents multiply in frequency and horror as Colin idly pokes about the Gothic quads, and the tightly modulated suspense ripens with a generous foretaste of Hilton's later acclaimed talent: finely perceived, individual characters, overwhelming atmosphere, and full complement of adventure and romance.From reviewer: I must admit it has been many years since I read this, picking it up because ""Random Harvest"" and ""Lost Horizon"" are favorites, and I enjoy mysteries. So, my rating is based mostly on not having a bad feeling about it, but not having a great one, either.P.S. This book was originally released in 1931 under the title ""Murder At School"" under a pen name of Glen Trevor."
5,Clock for My Patio,This clock is handsomely designed and reasonably priced. I recommended it for my next door neighbor.
1,Listen to the reviewers....it's JUNK!,"Just got this piece of garbage in today. Cheapest plastic known to man. Could barely fit an AA battery in it. After about an hour, it quit working. The second hand would bounce forward and back ever so slightly. I just need a simple, cheap clock. Didn't care what it was made of, but I don't think it's too much to ask for it to actually FUNCTION as a clock, and not a conversation piece.Honestly, just look for a different clock and save yourself the time and frustration of having to ship it back. And Amazon, you really shouldn't stock things like this. It's a waste not only for your customers, but for you too!"
1,Bad product,This clock's hands stick! We fixed it when we first got it (less than 6 months ago) and it is now stuck again and this time we can't fix it. It is lightweight and cheaply made. Buy something better.
2,Ya get what ya pay for,"Cheap clock, didn't expect top notch for the price, but...The second hand was loose in the case, we disassembled the case and fixed it on the second try. The hang hole on the back couldn't handle a standard sheet rock screw which should be the typical expectation unless they provide something else, which they did not."
2,Usage,This clock stops working as soon as I hang it on the wall.Changed battery several times but problem persists.
3,ticks too loud and looks cheap. usable in the kitchen.,"It's pretty average clok, too loud so it's now in the kitchen where I don't hear it much anymore. I"
3,Works Loudly,"I got this clock about a week ago, and I nearly sent it back. Mine seems to work just fine but it does make a soft, yet VERY audible 'thud' kind of noise with every movement of the second hand. If it were not two rooms away from my bedroom I wouldn't be able to stand it. I bought it to replace a very cheap plastic clock I've had for over 15 years that I got someplace like a dollar store, that finally died. The old one worked silently and so I'd forgotten that these things can be noisy. I'm disappointed, but I live in a remote place so not quite disappointed enough to hassle with returns & living without till a replacement arrives."
2,Very disappointing...did not live up to expectations,"After seeing the three claymation shorts whic preceded this film, I was expecting Nick Park to do a full-length feature which had the same quality plot as did his previous films. However, my wife and I sat down to watch it the other night. I felt like some of my laughter was somewhat forced on my part only because I had to do so, and my wife sat there stone cold quiet. It's not so much that the plot was unoriginal, but it was the way which it was done.Anyone can borrow a theme and reuse it to make it better. Sorry to be so blunt, but this film fell flatter than pancakes at IHOP.It's too bad that Nick Park et. al. won't be able to do another W&G; film to overcome this full-length featured disappointment, considering that their studio burned down to the ground after this film was completed."
1,Very Disappointing,We've enjoyed Wallace and Gromit for years and had looked forward to finally seeing this movie. I was terribly disappointed at the huge amounts of overt sexual innuendos. They were completely unnecessary and make the movie unsuitable for family viewing.
1,"Cute bunnies, but that's all.","I tried watching this on two occasions but could not complete it. I became extremely bored of the choppy animation and poor storyline and bad jokes. Grommit's expressions are used over and over and they get tiresome; how many times is he going to roll his eyes? The film's visuals made me depressed, I just didn't like the style. I congratulate them for working that long on a film, but the overused predictable plot and cliche characters just ruined it."
1,"How can this junk win an Oscar over ""Howl's Moving Castle"", which is original","Miyazaki is a good director in Japan his movie was robe. Just because it's a hand drawn cartoon and not claymation that doesn't mean it doesn't have good animation. Japanese anime is great.I felt this movie was kinda thin and unoriginal, it didn't feel like the writers put a lot of effort into this and had just decided to rip off other films instead of trying to make an original, not up to standards of previous Wallace and Gromit outing such as ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"" there were some funny moment but not enough to keep me interested. The British has got a lot of work to do to compete with the Japanese."
1,Terrible Terrible!!!,"In the words of the British, THIS IS RUBBISH!!! Terrible Movie clay cartoons are gross go rent a CGI movie before you buy this garbge.Writty By Dave."
5,Curse of the WereRabbit,"One of the funniest movies we've seen. Our kids (2 and 6) both love it and it's well done for adults, too. We've watched it again and again."
4,Quite Funny,"If you've seen Nick Parks' shorts, you'll probably really like this movie. If you like this movie, you really ought to check out his early 3 shorts. The movie is great for kids and adults and brings a sort of humor that all can enjoy."
4,Surprisingly good,"We bought this movie because my son lost the one we borrowed from a friend. After we received the movie, we found the lost one. So, now we own it. I wasn't too enthused about buying this movie but when we watched it, I actually enjoyed it. It is quite humorous and clean."
5,A HAND-MADE MASTERPIECE,"In the era of digital animation and compiuter graphics, it is almost unbelievable to see such a work of art. It is a very enjoyable movie with great sense of humour, and nice plot. It was only fair it won an Oscar. I highly recommend it."
5,Guaranteed to put a smile on your face,"This movie is fabulous, innocent yet witty, and guaranteed to put you in a good mood within the first 10 minutes. Appropriate for and appreciated by all ages. As great at home as it was on the big screen. Make sure to check out the Behind-the-Scenes Featurettes."
5,"Not quite the same, but great fun!","I've loved Wallace and Grommit ever since I saw them at an animation festival here in Sacramento, CA and think Nick Park is a creative genius! But for us old-school fans there's something amiss with the two this time around... not quite the same, but drop-dead hilarious nonetheless!It's a good clean movie with a lot of laughs. It's nice to seea ""G-rated"" movie that isn't so cheesy (pun intended!) My 4-yr-old daughter and 6-yr-old son have watched it and thought it was hilarious!Yes, it's worth the money. It's a fun movie with some great gags and humor. Two thumbs up!"
3,Wallace & Gromit,"This is a delightful and amusing spin on the timeless theme of good versus evil. The animation was excellent, the plot however was only luke warm. Even so, I found the movie entertaining."
5,Adorable video,"Our grandchildren (3 and 7), love The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. They watch it over and over. Enjoyable for the adults too. Be sure to watch extra of how movie was made."
3,Not such a good mix,"I am a big fan of all the previous Wallace and Gromit movies, but this one did not do it for me. I don't think the characters work well in this setting. The production quality is still superb, the characters are still lovable, but the plot in this one just didn't feel right. Seems they were trying to make it work a bit too hard. It was a bit too gory for my 5 year old as well."
3,A tad disappointing....,"I loved the first Wallace & Grommit movies. In fact, I absolutely adored them, so I had very high expectations for this movie.So, when I noticed fart gags and a few sexual innuendos obviously aimed at mainstream audiences, I was really disappointed. I felt like the movie had been dumbed down a bit, and although it was still a fun movie, it lacked the purity of the first films.In my opinion, the beauty of the original 'Wallace & Grommit' shorts was that they combined very clever storylines with a non-Hollywood simplicity. The storylines are still clever, but Hollywood has crept in..."
3,An Okay Movie,"I had to purchase this book because the one we checked out from the library had been misplaced. Before I could take the new copy to the library, we found the missing one. We got to keep this copy. I watched it with my children. It's okay."
2,Wallace & Gromit scratched,"My granddaughter and I watched this movie when we rec'd it. The movie was ok, but my granddaughter liked it. The annoying thing was it had interferances due to scratches on the DVD. I dislike purchasing defected products."
4,Good Wholesome Fun,"I thought this movie was adorable. I've always liked the little Wallace & Gromit sketches. Such talent . . . and patience! Every now and then you just have to sit down and watch a silly little film to make you feel good. My niece and nephew who are around 6 and 8 consider this to be one of their favorites.This film is rated G and therefore not filled with lots of intense action or anything scary. I suppose that's why it's not very popular where I live. But if you and your kids don't know what to watch, then I recommend this film. At the least, you'll think it's cute.One more thing, I thought this was cute and clever: In the scene where Gromit is waiting in the truck, he flips through the radio channels and comes across Art Garfunkel's ""Bright Eyes"" which is from one of my favorite films (and book) that's also about rabbits:Watership Down"
5,charming,I heard this movie won the academy award but disappointed the box office expectation. That's really too bad b/c this movie won the oscar for a reason. It's not only a great family movie but it's just a great movie for anyone of any age. It's one of the best animated movie of this decade!
5,Do See This Breakout Movie Genre,"Claymation rocks! This is simply fantastic new movie art form, moving clay combined with animation. Both Spotlight reviews show this as well as that the result is very viewable for children, they will love it, while adults will appreciate genius humor and intellectual fun side of this. This reviewer certainly did.Anti-Pesto? Marvelous! The gizmo producting Wallace produces device after device, only at times to have to have parts and loose ends scraped up by faithful sidekick Grommet.Get this and watch with the kids, or even if no kids, watch it!"
5,2 Great Heroes Back in Action!,This is one great film that is definitly worth all the Hard work. The wonderful people at Aardman have done a terrific job.The great cheese loving inventor and his faithful canine are back in their biggest adventure yet. Based on the award winning classics this film has the 2 heroes and alot of wonderful new characters too.This is one film that is perfect for the entire family that will last for years to come!
4,TOO FUNNY!!,Loved the voices and plot. Great for kids and adults. A few surprises really make it seeing over and over again.
5,The best comedy duo around,"There's always the classic pairing of the straight man and the funny man; the talking man and, in this case, the silent dog--a combination that has been brought to life with the brilliantly rendered plasticine characters of Wallace & Gromit.The Curse of the Were-rabbit is not only a comedy for everyone, it's also a tender look at the relationship between a hapless man and his best friend.Nick Park's nods to the mad-cap adventures and stylistic beauty of 40's films (for instance, Wallace's infamous contraptions) is sure to bring any viewer a sense of surreal nostalgia that, though never experienced, is fully realized in this beautifully rendered world. Not to mention the detailed visual gags! Each scene is chock full of delightfully punny objects (Newspapers, books, magazines, food labels) that wink playfully at the eagle-eyed viewer. I can't wait to watch this on DVD and pause each scene to see what the animators happened to slyly nudge onto the set."
4,Finally a Full-Length Wallace & Gromit!,"When it comes to Wallace & Gromit, the cheesier, the better! This full-length adventure is lots of fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. It is a great addition to any DVD collection."
4,"Wallace=Master, Gromit=Mind","{spoilers}:Something very bunny is going on. It's no surprise for Wallace and Gromit as a team. This cheese-obsessed man and his dog who never says anything investigate the garden sabotage that has gone around their neighborhood just before the annual giant vegetable growing contest. They use all the rabbits they've caught for Rabbit Rehabilitation so they won't like vegetables. It gets messed up and one of these rabbits {named Hutch} mutates and gets bigger, but this has also somehow affected Wallace. After this ""were-rabbit"" terrorizes the town, things only become plain fun when weirder things begin to happen while Wallace and Gromit investigate.Good claymation for a fun movie, I must say. 4 and a half out of 5 stars."
5,"I'm not a kid, but loved this movie!",This movie is adorable! I could not stop watching it. I think it will be one of those movies (and I have very few) that I will watch over and over!
4,5 stars for the movie 3 for extras,i LOVE this movie! I laughed and i cried and i laughed till i cried :) This movie is great for all ages--everyone can find something about it that's appealing. A creative and cheeky story :) i was just hoping for another full DVD worth of extras.. but the movie can be guaranteed not to disappoint!
4,"Cute, Funny, But sometimes slow","The title says it all. The movie had interesting and funny parts. However, the outcome was somewhat predictable. Lots of parts are funny because they relate to things adults can understand. Other parts would be funny to kids. Overall, it is not a bad movie to rent, but not something to be bought and watched over and over again (at least by 30 something year olds)."
2,Not seeing a difference in the Air,"I installed this unit and that went wellTurned it on and adjusted the humidity were it was just about to turn off ,and let the furnace run4 hours later the motor was still turning the filter .I will give it a little longer to prove it,s self but a little sceptical That time will do anythingI think the motor will wear out with this thing not putting water into the air ."
3,Short and not worth the money,I was surprised at how small this book was and little information. I don't think it was worth the price.
1,Dried up with bugs and mold,My Child recieved this game for Christmas from the Cancer society (2011) .... upon opening the game she was horrified! not only was the clay (in its plastic wrappers) dried up but also infested with dead bugs-- winged of some kind......... and white mold. When I contacted the company the costomer service denied my request for a replacement game. And told me I was rude for asking for one.
3,Nice fun game,"We principally bought this game because we were impressed by Wits and Wagers by the same manufacturer. While not as entertaining, we still have lots of fun with Cluzzle. The game is suitable for several age groups. The scoring scheme described seemed a little unintuitive, but we just reversed the rule to make it alright. Overall, a nice party game that can be enjoyed by groups of four or more."
3,"Fun, but unusable clay","My rating is lowered based on receiving a defective product, not the game itself. We played this at a friend's house and loved it, so ordered our own copy through Amazon. Our game arrived with rock-hard, unusable clay even though it was wrapped in plastic and sealed in containers. We were ready to play after opening it, so we just made a quick trip to the store for Play-Doh and it worked perfectly.Product condition - 1 starGame - 5 stars"
2,Not so much...,"Didn't really like this game. Sounded good, but it was pretty lame. We made up our own rules but then donated to charity."
1,Weak!!,Its pretty tough to compete with some great ones out there but this movie didn't even try. I could have done better with a low class camcorder in my backyard. Acting is just outright horrible. Complete waste of money and time.
1,BEWARE- SELLER SENDS A GENERIC BRAND,"This seller is deceiving people by describing it as Avery brand labels. Instead he is sending generic labels, Basic brand. I emailed him about it and he made all kinds of excuses, even stating that the description says it's ""compatible"" with Avery labels. But I double checked and nowhere does it say that. I even sent him a screen print of the page and he had no comeback. His page is completely misleading.Some may not care if they are generic, but don't lie to your customers. Also, for me I need the high quality Avery brand for my business. He put me in a bind when these arrived. He offered a refund, but would not send the advertised Avery labels. It's not worth $15 to return them, so I probably won't. Hopefully he will have edited the site by the time you read this."
4,"Good Entertainment, But NOT For Small Children","I found this movie very enjoyable with a nice combination of comedy and suspenseful ""horror."" This is not a bloody movie, but does have a lot of shocking starts. Within the first five minutes the movie shows: 1. A tarot card with a naked man and woman (on the level of the statue David). 2. It also shows a man hanging by the neck dead. (Not an animation, but an actual person.) 3. It has a startling beginning that would bother *anybody* that doesn't like it when things jump out of nowhere without warning.I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but my 10-year old daughter probably wouldn't have been able to stomach all of the ""surprises."" The special effects were excellent, and the comedy is vintage Eddie Murphy."
2,Silly nonsense,"Silly nonsense. This was another painful experience. Almost every part of this film (aside from the special effects), is horrible. I would not recomend it as family viewing. Unless you don't mind your children seeing it, they might enjoy it, but there are some very frightening scenes, and, although there isn't any foul language or nudity, there really is nothing redeeming about it. NOTE: The special features are much better than the movie.** Two Stars"
2,Poor Eddie!,"The Haunted Mansion starring Eddie Murphy was a film I watched a few years ago on t.v. I was disappointed because when is the last time Murphy did a memorable film? and I hated Dreamgirls in which he was nominated for an Oscar. The Haunted Mansion is based on the ride at Disneyland, I wasn't impressed by this family film at all but I did like how colorful it was. Lame story and messy acting, only tacky kids would dig this train wreck."
2,Uninspired...,"...or so it looks. Actually more a 3/6 than a 2/5 I guess, but the movie at its' best is ok. And I'm a big fan of fantasy-movies, and of Eddie Murphy. But even for a childrens' movie the story and plot is very thin, not to mention used as in ""old"" and ""seen it before"".The haunted mansion looks good though, the place has potential - and perhaps that is what makes the movie watchable.Eddie Murphy has never tried to cover up for making some of his later movies only for the profit, his heart isn't in it anymore it seems. The best ""resent"" movies are Nutty Professor 1 & 2 in my opinion, other than that (and Shrek 1 & 2 of course) he has wasted a lot of his talent making B-movies far below his league, a shame really.Hoping for a comeback soon!Rent first, do not risk your money buying here..."
3,Flat !!,"There is only one word that comes to mind when reviewing this movie........... FLAT !It's not funny, not scary, not action packed, not a drama.... I don't know what they were aiming for here.I wanted to love this movie because I am a Haunted Mansion fanatic... I own every souvenier, sound effects album, copy of blueprints, etc.... available on the Haunted Mansion attraction and it's history.Regarding the movie, it was nice to see them use Walt's original idea for the architecture and the original 1950's Gracey mansion legend.Maybe only die-hard Doombuggy fans picked up on this dedication trivia.... BUT... the movie just did not come together in a successful way like Pirates did last year.It is probably still good family entertainment for 90 minutes or so... but nothing that will leave a lasting memory or impression.It felt like a movie ""made by committee"" where so many different people's input collided in such a way the movie just plodded along with no real life or ""spark""."
2,"Eddie Murphy great, story lacking.","Eddie was prefect for the film! This movie was quite a disappointment! (It was no Pirates of the Carr.)! The story was choppy at best, the evil butler states ""go to hell"", and is SOMEHOW able to open a portal, which takes the butler! What? Who cursed the house? How were they going to get the wife if the kids were not in danger? Sloppy at best. A few entertaining moments, but not enough to make you buy the ticket. Wait to rent it."
1,Too Scary,All I have to say is this movie was way too scary for my kids. They couldn't even make it through the entire movie before asking to turn it off. We bought the DVD and opened it so now we can't return it. Parts I thought were a little frightening. There is one part where Eddie Murphy and the daughter in the movie are being chased by several skeletons (reminded me of Michael Jackson's Thriller video) while being trapped in a large tomb. I wish we had never purchased it. My kids don't even like to look at the DVD cover. Funny part is my kids have watched The Lord of the Rings and were not scared by that.
4,for Aficionados,"the movie is certainly interesting for those who know and like the haunted mansion at Disney's and who like to compare how the different objects and locations of the Magic Kingdom attraction have been used. Thanks to Eddy Murphy you get quite a few laughs, but some of the scenes are a little bit shrill, so that the movie is not suitable for little children."
2,The Haunted mansion,The story line is very bad. I feel like the studio rush this movie out to fast and not care about the story. I gave this movie 2 stars because the special effect.
1,wish i could give it less,"as a fan of the ride. i was worried. i saw a preview and thought ""eh, might be alright.""boy was i wrong.funniest parts are whent hey insulted Eddie Murphy.they butchered the ride to amke it ""oh i know this part"". Paul Frees' genius is long and forgotten in this 1 and 1/2 hour sleep machine. they based too much of the movie on opresumptions and guesses about the ride and did too little with what they actually had.stay away from this Mansion and goto Disney World and get a better bang for your buck."
3,Haunted House becomes a Madhouse,"The movie is noisy, very noisy, with the help of Mr. Eddie Murphy as a distressed father of a family in jeopardy caught up in a ghost dwelling of spiritual possession. Eddie overacts all over the place with little result in entertainment, and the grand effects are wasted in this movie by making only slight cameos that remind you of the Disneyland ride itself. Other than that, any hint of the tale that lingers in the walls of the Haunted Mansion attic do not exist, or explain any justified story that might have been told to cause the hauntings to begin with, they are merely the end result of a demented curse upon the mansion. The Haunted Mansion ride really needed no explanation, and it was best to leave it to the spectator to make his or her own story to accompany the goings on there, and this movie only brings to light, that the ride is so much better for it all.By the way, the only valid reason in buying this dvd is for the extras, which are highly entertaining."
4,Fun movie for the Family,[These]This movie was creative & fun. It is a enjoyable movie for all ages all though it will probably be more entertaining for a younger audience. Definetely a must own on DVD.
1,Could this be as good as the Ride?,"I didn't like this film as much as I liked the Ride at Disney. I thought that this movie messed up the entire concept of The Haunted Mansion. This Movie in my oppinion was only made because Pirates of the Caribbean was a hit film and people wanted their eyes on The Haunted Mansion.This movie was funny, but still, it was very stupid in the way that it was made. I wish they would have made more out of this movie, like making it more like the ride. I went to disneyland and the first thing I did was go on the haunted mansion ride. This movie makes me never want to ride that ride ever again."
2,A failed attempt.,"This film was a little like The Cat in the Hat, too scary or crude for kids, too bland for teens, and too dorky for adults. This film should have done more like its predecessor The Pirates of the Caribbean, and been set not in modern times but in maybe the 1600s. The acting wasn't that great, and in my opinion Eddie Murphey should've stick to the PG-13 and up films. The story was way too predictable and didn't live up to the ride. In my opinion, you will get more laughs and satisfaction by going to a Disney Theme Park and ride the 2 minute ride, instead of trying to sit through this hour and a half flop."
5,REAL GOOD!,"GOOD,SCARY,AND FUNNY!MY WHOLE FAMILY LAUGED AT ALMOST EVERY SEEN!I KNEW IT WOULD BE FUNNY THOUGE BECAUSE IT HAD EDDIE MURPHY!SO,IT`S A GREAT MOVIE!"
2,"Eddie Murphy great, story lacking.","Eddie was perfect for the film! This movie was quite a disappointment! (It was no Pirates of the Carr.)! The story was choppy at best, the evil butler states ""go to hell"", and is SOMEHOW able to open a portal, which takes the butler! What? Who cursed the house? How were they going to get the wife if the kids were not in danger? Sloppy at best. A few entertaining moments, but not enough to make you buy the ticket. Wait to rent it."
1,children's movie,"This is a Walt Disney movie with Eddie Murphy and in my view a movie for children...but then again the effects are too gruesome for children. So I don't know at what audience this movie is really pointing at. Too scary for children, too boring for adults."
1,One of the worst movies I have seen...,"Don't waste your money on this one! The plot was severly lacking and the acting itself was less than desirable. The movie had a few ""almost funny"" moments but this didn't make up for the rest of the time."
1,Geee Minus,"Eddie Murphy should quit while ...just Quit!. He's not funny like he used to be. Not a well written line nor plot. I kept yawning, although it wasn't a sleeper...You keep hoping something in the movie would thicken or catch your interest.It's just another TV movie...no, wait...TV movies are better."
1,Horrible...Drawn out and boring with 3 year old humor.,"Do not see this movie...After being pleasantly surprised by Pirates of the Caribbean, we were actually looking forward to this movie...big mistake. It could have been so much better if they would have put some of the PG-13 that went into the PotC movie into this one. Went for something cool got a lame/cutesy Casper movie..."
3,HAUNTED MANSION.,IDE GIVE IT A 3 IN A HALF. THIS ONE ISNT BAD BUT ITS NOT GREAT EITHER. DOESNT REALLY FOLLOW THE RIDES THEME THAT MUCH AND THATS BAD SOME WAYS AND GOOD IN OTHER WAYS. ITS GOT A FEW GOOD FUNNY MOMENTS. KIDS WILL LIKE IT BUT ONLY SOME ADULTS WILL. ITS ABOUT A REAL ESTATE AGENT AND HIS FAMILY GO TO A HOUSE IN ORDER TO SELL IT BUT ENDS UP HAVING TO STAY THE NIGHT BECAUSE OF A BAD STORM. TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A STORY AND LEGEND THAT FLOATS THREW THIS HOUSE AND ONCE THIS UNEXPECTING FAMILY FINDS OUT WHAT IT IS IT MAY JUST MAKE THEM BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.
2,"Fun, but also strange","The Haunted Mansion is a pretty fun movie, but it also has weird parts about hell and some parts about crystal balls. The story isn't very good for adults, but I wouldn't want a child to see the parts about crystal balls and hell. Therefore, it doesn't really reach any age level. It could have been good, however, if it hadn't had the parts about hell and crystal balls."
2,NOT Suitable for young children! PG is misleading rating,"Having just watched this movie, I am amazed at the ""PG"" rating. Small children will find this movie VERY scary and those older will probably have a few nightmares. I would not recommend it to under 10's. The effects are very real, beware! Some of the reviews I have read, 6 year olds have seen it. In my opinion, they are way too young.Story line was VERY week, could have been alot better. If this is the acepted standard then PLEASE do not make a sequel!"
2,Very Disapointing,"Disney has long enjoyed success in its parks by building rides inspired by their movies, now they've tried to reverse that by writing a movie inspired by the popular Magic Kingdom attraction, The Haunted Mansion.Unfortunately, the plot is weak, the humor sophomoric and the suspense is non-existent. I gave the movie 2 out of 5 stars because there <i>are</i> a few cool effects and Eddie Murphy is able to salvage almost anything.If you have young children who have been pestering you to be allowed to watch a ""scary"" movie, but you're worried about turning them loose on Stephen King, then this might be an okay compromise. But bring a good book to the couch with you, because its probably not going to keep the attention of anyone over the age of 10, definitely not over the age of 15."
4,Really great family movie,"I thought it was a great movie, and I don't understand all the criticism. The story line was interesting, effects really good, and because I didn't read the reviews that give away the whole story, I found it an innovative plot. It was spookier than I expected, probably a bit scary for little kids, but fine for above 6. It was sweet, spooky, and with just enough comedy and action. Definitely one of the better family movies I have seen in the past few years, I am surprised it wasn't a bigger hit at the theaters--but then again I often find reviewers to be wrong about good movies."
3,An Average Movie,"Not bad. Especially if you have ever been to Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, gives a nice story to follow. But, don't expect the story to be as good as Pirates of the Carribean. Overall, I think the writing was aceptable but subpar and the actors are guilty of ""overacting""."
4,Review for The Haunted Mansion,"Director Rob Minkoff tries to strike a balance between funny and scary, but the movie never really generates screams of either kind. There's a little that outshines effects in the actual Disneyland house. And Murphy seems to haunt the movie than star in it. This is a fright show artfully designed for the whole family, a comedy that all but the most impressionable childern will likely get a kick out of. The film equivalent of the dark, borning period on a haunted house ride before the gondola crashes into another room filled with dirty mirrors, though, I recommend seeing this."
2,A Lousy Movie About My Favorite Disney Ride,"As kid, I was absolutely enchanted by Disneyland's Haunted Mansion. When the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie was such an enjoyable smash hit, I got even more excited about seeing this film, but it was a big letdown.The artistic design and special effects are, for the most part, a genuine tribute to the magic of the ride. But, whereas elements of the ""Pirates"" ride were implemented into the plotline of its movie with seamless credibility, references to the ghostly attraction in this movie were somewhat gratuitous.Add to that an endless parade of low-brow humor, poor writing and cheesy acting, and you have really ticked me off, Disney. With all the heart and creativity he poured into his attraction, I'm sure the spirit of Walt is troubled within his cryogenically-preserved body which orbits the earth even as I type this review."
2,not that great!,This is my favorite disneyland ride so i was excited about seeing it. man was i dissapointed! yes this movie had some excellant fx and great nods to the ride. the plot was horrible. ha what plot? basically this looked like it was thrown together and it shows! still i am giving it two stars for special effects only and that's it. oh and for jennifer tilly as madame leota(she was the best actor in the movie and she was only a head!)Eddie murphy was annoying as was his kids. you just wanted to smack them! i rank this not as good as pirates but better then country bears. but not by much! Just ride the ride instead!
3,GREAT attraction-only OK film,"When this was released the fall of 2003 I had great expectations because of how much I enjoyed `Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" that was released the same year.I was let down.Have always loved ""The Haunted Mansion"" attraction at Disneyland.Eddie Murphy doing his usual role of a smart alec, pushy guy. Did not care about his character nor the kids.Madam Leota if you are expecting an eerie vision from the attraction you will be disappointed. Jennifer Tilly just repeated some of the lines from the attraction.The special effects were great.They did nothing with the characters & how much can a person take of Eddie Murphy doing the same old thing?"
1,this is a comedy?,"definately, one of the worst movies i have seen from 2003, watched it with my 6 year old daughter and could not figure out why they called it a comedy, not one funny scene in the whole flick, also , would not find this disaster a fit movie for any child under the age of 10,effects were so-so but, the direction and storyline were absolutely abominable, can only thank the stars that pixar continues to do movies for children and you are better suited to go in that direction if you have young ones............."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS PIRATES !,"Following in the footsteps of PIRATES, Disney attempts to strike lighting one more time with this title. They do not succeed. This film was not a huge success at the box office, and there is a reason behind this lack of box office magic. The script is predictable and truly dull. It is not entertaining for adult or teens. The special effects are not really special and MURPHY's brand of acting/comedy is dated (very 1980s). Not a wise investment as a DVD purchase."
4,Good Movie,"Our family enjoyed this movie. It got a little scary toward the end. My 6 year old covered his eyes at the graveyard scene, but other than that part, the rest was good. I would recommend it for a family movie."
3,Eh,"This isn't a great movie, but it isn't awful either. I chanced to see this on TV the other day, otherwise I wouldn't have seen it. It's an all right flick for a rainy day afternoon or whatever, but I can't recommend this even for rental unless you're a die-hard Eddie Murphy fan. There's a few funny parts in here, but the film pans out at a so-so 2.5 out of 5 stars but because I can't give half-stars, I'll just give a three."
5,Fun and Haunting Adventure!,"Unlike most of the people who watched this film,I really enjoyed it! I was entertained from start to finish, I loved the plot and the dark vibe that you feel as you're watching it. It's a very clever and funny story about a man who is always working at his business.One day, his wife gets a phone call to come and visit a mansion that they want to be sold. For some odd reason, the people who live in this mansion only wants her to come, not her husband. Of course, this mansion is The Haunted Mansion. The whole family makes a stop at the mansion, just to check it out. Unfortunately, the rain causes them to have to stay all night. This starts the fun and eciting adventure through The Haunted Mansion.It features a wonderful story that makes perfect sense, and it also features adventures. Take an exciting ride through The Haunted Mansion with this family and all of the creepy people who live inside the mansion!"
3,Rent don't buy...,"This movie is good for a one time watching, yet it is not good enough to own.The plot Murphy sells houses and goes to a house on the way to a vacation. When his family enters they are trapped and have to fight ghosts (with a few laughs nothing like a belly laugh) to get rid of the curse and get out of the mansion. There really is no more of a plot than that. It is not the worse movie I have seen but it is also not the best...it is not a comedy as it is portrayed it seems more like just a nice, clean movie to watch.My recommendation rent not buy this movie."
4,Scary...but in a kids eyes....:),"This film was really cute...it had some really high action scenes at times, and it was something that the kids could get through. Eddie Murphy and cast did a really good job in portraying the characters that they were in this film. I found Eddie's character to be a bit on the sarcastic side at times, but when the film was over, he realized that his family meant more than the way that his career and what others thought of him...although this was geared towards being a ""scary"" film the director made a great attempt at using the ghosts in the film as a way of helping Eddie's character to realize what the word and the presence of family meant!!! Good Film!!!"
1,P-U,"OK, enough with the generous star donations here. Anything more than one star is wasted on this poor adaption of the myriad of horror/comedies that have preceded it. And I'm really reaching when I refer to this as a comedy. The acting, special effects, plot and cinematography fell well short of my expectations. Sure, there were some decent special effects but the film lacked consistency overall. Scene transitions seemed forced or disjointed, which made it difficult to follow the acting/action. I couldn't help but wonder if Eddie Murphy really wanted to do this film, or not. I half-heartedly agree with some of the other reviewers who noted that youngsters might find this film entertaining -- my 11 and 13 year olds found it mostly predictable and boring. Give this one a pass unless you're a true Eddie Murphy fan, and you don't mind throwing away your money."
4,another fun ride base movie.,"In a nutshell . This is Disney's latest instalment of theme park rides - not as entertaining as Pirates(too me anyway),But using star power of Eddie Murphy(as owner of a relator company) Disney once again succeeds in bring a ride's sets too the big screen.In a nut shell :This kid freindly haunted house movie features the Ever's Family,who are invited to a strange old expensive house.The assumed reason is too put it up for sale,but there are more sinster adjenders lurking in the shadows.With the coming of a sudden storm -the detour too a family vaction becomes a rather comical forced overnight stay for the Evers. Join the fun in this 3.5 star movie as we learn all about the Haunted Mansion's -residence ,curses , and surprises.FX- is very good.If your familar with the ride you may just say""I remember that room.""One part I found rather amusing is the stone head quartet."
1,Stick to the ride,"HM is boring for adults. There's no real plot, just a jumble of sfx. For kids it could be pretty scary. If I were 8, I'd be freaked out."
2,not very good,It was interesting to see the stars. But the material was awful. I thought it was a laurel and hardy short. It was not. They were only in for a minute
5,no more dirty rollers,I used to have to clean the rollers weekly with my old mouse. Not anymore with this laser mouse. Very easy to usewithout a mouse pad and I like the added features like the back button. I prefer a corded model so I never have to deal with batteries. I would recommend a laser mouse to anyone. So much easier to maintain than the old roller ball.
5,fantastic tool set,Great little tool set. I really like the hollow bits so you can stop worrying about the threads of the bolt pushing the socket off the nut.
5,"Good reference book, in an easy-to-read format","This is a good reference book for a range of different psychological theories around the notion of ""decision making under uncertainty"". I use it to get a quick overview of a theory that sounds promising to draw upon for my own academic research in strategic management. Recommended!"
3,pretty good,well teds not singing so it must be good lolthe new singer from bad co sings on this cdhe is a great vocalist half of this cd is gr8rest is just so so
2,Ted Was Lost ?,"This record sounded a lot like Aldo Nova did at the time. Also, the tracks that Ted sings lead vocals on are not the best tracks on this record which is a little unusual for Ted to let that happen. Tied Up In Love is freakin' awesome ! Too bad he didn't write it or else it might have ended up on a greatest hits package one day. I love that song and I remember that there was a really cheesy but cool video for it way back when. Overall, I think this a weak effort from Ted as evidenced by his earlier work as well as his more recent recordings such as Spirit of the Wild and Craveman which are both proof of the rock & roll greatness that Ted is now and has always been capable of when he takes his time in the studio."
3,A solid rock album with a melodic touch,"Ted Nugent's ""Penetrator"" is a strong album of melodic heavy metal. With songs like ""Tied up in love"" and ""Draw the line"" among others, this effort is better than many other albums by Mr. Nugent. A good thing is that he has recruited a proper singer - Brian Howe - and keeping his own singing at a minimum. If you like melodic but not cheesy rock, this album could be a real treat for you."
5,Absolutely lovely!,"Great new author. This book is absolutely wonderful. The writing and paintings are excellent. Wherever you live, the story will immediately bring you and your child the tranquility of Hawaiian night. Lovely! I hope to see more children's books from Ms. Kono soon."
1,Great tunes - bad download,"The music contained on this album is fantastic. Unfortuntely, there is a problem with the mp3 download. Half the tracks have serious audio problems that I know are unrelated to the actual recording of the music.fyi: Sam & Dave's ""Soul Men"" album is the only one i have downloaded that doesn't have audio problems."
4,Powerful Melodic Rock,"Released in 2003, the appropriately titled Second to None is the sophomore album by Swedish melodic rockers Eclipse. The Swedes seem to have a real knack for making quality melodic rock music, and Eclipse is no exception. The band has a hard hitting yet still melodic sound similar to latter day Europe (onStart From the Dark), TNT (My Religion) and Winger (Pull). It's actually the kind of sound you'd normally expect from a more seasoned band.Second to None is a very solid album from start to finish, and a hard rocking one at that. The ballads kill the buzz a bit, but they're still pretty good songs. I won't go so far as to call Second to None a must-have album, but fans of Europe, TNT, Shy, and other melodic hard rock acts should be pleased with this Eclipse album."
1,Avoid this album like it was bubonic plague,"I had a coupon and the store had been pretty well picked over. I thought why not a nice acoustic album by some noted artists like Coldplay, Radiohead, Joss Stone, etc.?WHAT A MISTAKE!!This may be the worst album purchase I've ever made in my long life. I had it in the car and I couldn't even stand to work my way through the 18 songs even once despite hitting NEXT every minute. I can't help thinking someone went to these artists and said ""Have you got something acoustic you don't need or want? Maybe we can squeeze a few bucks out of the throwaways."""
3,Poor audio quality.,This information packed DVD could have been much better if it had a better audio quality (neccessary to grab unfamilier sailing terms) and a detailed index.
5,It's not only for kids,"This is a wonderful book for both children and adult. (except sort of discouraging to see little kid skating that well and doing all the hard moves, like jumping a ramp.) There are great skating maintainence section and all the basic moves."
2,A Disapointment,"This was a disappointment for me. I thought he plot was not very well thought out, the story not very exciting, and the writing stiff and wooden. Maybe it is just me, but I judge this type of book by The Hunt For Red October and this was nowhere near that class. It had all the standard submarine descriptions and speech, but not much more in my opinion. I just did not have to guess where the story was going. On the positive side the book does provide some interesting facts about USSR boats and the realistic use of USSR and USA tactics in the action scenes"
1,"Misrepresentation of size, it is a 24 Cup rice cooker","I wanted to purchase a 48 cup unit and that is what their ad said ""48-Cup Commercial Pot-Style Rice Cooker"". This is a cheep 24 cup unit and I have been trying to send back. There are a lot of good 24 cup cookers for half the cost"
4,"I love it, even if it does sound 80's","Although I do admit that some of the songs on here are weak, still, I have to give it kudos because of Roger's awesome and powerful voice. I swear, the man could make an album of him playing plastic spoons and a bucket, and I'd still buy it because of his voice. He's one of my favorite singers of all time. ""After the Fire"" is obviously the best song on the album, but the reason for that is pretty obvious."
4,Good Game,"I bought this because I like Dynasty Warior 5 (original). This expansion is pretty good, but it was too much like the original. Not many new feature. I like Dynasty Warior 5 Empire better."
4,Great Game,"This game ROCKS no matter what people say! It is more tactical than any other DW game, and better overall. With 2 new challange modes, new items, 18 new levels, and 5 modes, it is well worth the money."
5,Rich historical document,"Fantastic slim old tome on the rebuilding of the White House during the Truman administration. Includes photos of the demolition and reconstruction and several high-quality color images of the finished rooms. It details many of the costs and history behind the project and includes detailed floor plans of the ground, first, second, and third floors of the Residence. However, there is nothing on the East Wing or West Wing (which were hardly touched) and almost nothing on the furnishings, and no photos of the less famous rooms."
4,"Raw, intraspective look into a life of the son of a legend.","Julian Lennon, fresh to America and recording, releases his debut album. Dripping with deferences to his dad and sounding just a bit off of that, he delivers incredibly-poignant songs and melodies, although Beatlesque, brilliant, nonetheless."
5,Great Debut,"Its hard enough to be a rock legends son, so people were skeptical of Julian first release. However, this album is amazing. Its peaked at #17 on the charts, and spawned three hits Too Late For Goodbyes, Say Youre Wrong, and Valotte. At only 21, Julian shows real talent for writing and singing. Pick this one up!"
4,Best flushable litter,"I use this in my cats' OmegaPaw rolling litterbox (which rocks, btw). I've tried several types of clumping flushable litter (Arm & Hammer, World's Best, Swheat Scoop & another paper-based litter with a light pine scent), and this one clumps the hardest, has the least waste, least dust, and no overpowering odor. I'd give it 5 stars, but it tracks a little more than I'd like (but not more than any other clumping litter, just a bit more than some of the other natural ones with larger granules). This one is the overall winner, controlling odors, clumping well, and using less overall. Yay!Update: Subsequent bags did not work well (very poor clumping) for some reason. I'm guessing it's the humidity & thinking this maybe this is a winter-only litter in my area. I would have given the later bags 1 star for their very poor clumping."
1,Not the whole thing,"I bought this DVD to revive the memories of a broadcast from my childhood years. It costs quite higher than an average single-disk DVD from Amazon and I still thought it is worth having it on DVD at home.On first seconds of the film I was surprised with quality. The picture is quite grainy with dust pieces visible. The tape was not edited or remastered. Yet this is not the major disappointment.This is only the second part or mini-series of the two. The one here starts when the main characters are alreay married with kids and running their boat. The whole chunk about Deli's arrival to Australia and childhood, as well as how she met Brenton was in the first part, not included here. Plus, the VHS-version reviews state that the American edition (as well as Australian DVD) was heavily edited from the original broadcast.I guess, I wasted $18+SH on something which will stand on my shelf. What I want is a complete mini-series (both parts) and this edition sold here is not the thing."
3,Could be better,"I bought this book to try to fix an electrical problem on the fuel pump relay. There are no pictures for hardly any of the electrical stuff, only schematics. Those are nice, but you have to know where the stupid thing is (buried under the dashboard, it turns out)."
1,awful,"confusing, no detail.... You cannot wirte a 276 pg book for 10 years worth of 2 different cars... There are no pictures and often little detail on what you are supposed to be looking at... Maybe a good, i mena good mechanic could use this book, but no one else..."
3,too much models,"i brought this manual to repair my 93 accord, and there's too much stuff about preludes and old accords. A useful book, but take much models for a short book. A bigger book should solve it, with more photos."
1,Magazine is great... but you won't get them,"The company that distributes this magazine in the United States does an extremely poor job. After subscribing, I got 3 magazines (all on the same day) and then nothing. I e-mailed and called. I got one response saying that they were backed up... but never got any other magazines.The magazine itself it great though (5 stars for the magazine)... pick it up at a newsstand and enjoy.. but don't subscribe if you live in the US."
4,"Tough install, but woth it for gas savings and performance","I've put a K&N; air filter into every car I've owned. And I've always been satisfied with the durability and increased gas mileage gained since installation.This filter is no exception.The only bad part is that dropping a new filter in my VW GTI is complicated since you need to remove the engine cover. I paid my dealer $18 to do this during a routine service.VW doesn't recommend this filter -- they use paper filters as OEM -- but I trust the product not to damage the car. So far, so good."
4,"Walks like a duck, and talks like a duck, must be a....","Yeah, its a filter, no noticeable mileage increase, the factory air box is just too jacked up to flow well wnough to get any decent results. Not to mention on my '07 Passat Wagon, the box is an absolute terror to get off the motor, but I'll take that gripe up with VW. Needless to say, I bought a Cold Air kit instead from Neuspeed, the 'wagon chirps through first and second now from a standing start, yeah, blow my mind. Already have gotten a few raised eyebrows for the little bit of money spent. I got nothing aginst K&N, as that is what's on my CA intake, but this filter really never gets to realize it's true potential with the garbage airbox VW put on."
4,"Grr baby, grr.","I don't know what it is about K&N filters that make my stock vehicle sound like a growling bear. I've used these forever in every car, truck, and motorcycle I've owned from street cars to race cars. They work as advertised and even in dusty rallies, have never let the junk into my engine. Plus they make the car sound great. grr."
2,just an alternative to OEM,there was no power increase. and it become dirty sooner then OEM one.do not recomend it as a sport filter.after i changed whole intake and installed EVMO's whole intake system with big air filter and really felt the difference.
3,"When in doubt, rent it first!","I decided to rent the DVD for 2010 first, based on the reviews I read here. I am glad I did. This film was more intriguing in theory than in fact. 2001 was visually stunning; 2010 was just another scifi flick.A number of things were offensive to me in this film. First, the United States was incapable of building a ship that could return to Jupiter first to learn about what happened to the Discovery; instead, the U.S. had to rely on the Soviet Union to get there. U.S.-Soviet joint ventures is space were a popular film themes in the 1980s and early 1990s before the country collapsed, and this is just one more.Most offensive, was the absurd ""let's kiss and make up and we will all live in peace"" ending. I wanted to throwup. I was glad I had not made the mistake of buying this DVD and rented it instead.2001 will always remain a high water mark in science fiction films. 2010 will most certainly not."
1,2000 too many,"i saw several glowing reviews of this film so i HAD to put in my two bits here ...2010 is to me, without question, the worst sequel ever made ... it's a movie *so* bad that it actually manages to taint the original, which is easily one of the great films of the 20th century ...the mystery, mystique and severe look of the orginal are gone ... replaced by a sophomoric, placating story line and bad acting by former ""jaws"" actors.all you really need to know is mr. kubrick saw the screenplay and ran the other direction ... instead the studio settled for peter ""who?"" hyams, director of such classics as ""capricorn one"" (with oj simpson) and ""peeper"" (aka ""fat chance,"" i kid you not).the only reason i rate this a ""one star"" is because there isn't a ""zero."" technically, it should be rated as a black hole. don't let it suck you in."
1,right up there with 'my best friend's wedding',"Wow.2001 was a masterpiece. A subtle, awe-inspiring and timeless masterpiece.2010 is awe-inspiring for how pathetic it is. The acting is terrible, and it is as subtle as a sledgehammer. Amazingly, the effects of 2001 are many times better than 2010 even though the sequel was made about fifteen years later.Horrible movie. 2001 is timeless and speaks to all generations. 2010 is a cheesy 80s flick, especially with the Cold War subplots and bad Russian accents.If you need a paperweight, or a doorstop, then go out and buy 2010. Otherwise, let it rot in peace."
1,A travesty on the novel!,"Doesn't keep faith in any way with the novel, which is vintage ACC at his matchless best. Screwed up plotline, screwed up context, screwed up acting, you name it. Give this thing a pass and buy the book."
3,finishing the remake,This is the rest of the remake of Assignment: Outer Space. See my comments in 2001: Space Odyssey.
3,"Pretty Good Movie, some video quality problems","I am not a huge 2001/Arthur C. Clarke fan, however I did enjoy this movie. I would recommend it if you are into Sci-Fi at all.I would like to point out two things, though: When people watch the movie in the year 2010, it will seem very goofy to think that America and the USSR will be about to go to war... considering that that latter won't have existed for 20 years. Finally, this movie has a problem where in several scenes the spaceships have a ""halo"" around them. I think that this is caused by the clear film that surrounded the space ship pieces when they were glued onto the starfield background. I am not saying that this problem is unique to the DVD, but it is present on the DVD and is a little annoying. I know that old Star Wars videos had this problem, but Lucas has since cleaned them up. The process of converting 2010 to DVD might have been a good time to fix this problem, but that opportunity appears to have been missed."
1,Aside from making money... why?,"Really, set aside the desire to make money, the question ""why?"" has got to pop into the mind of anyone even cognizant of the fact that there is a sequel to 2001. There is absolutely no reason for this film to exist. It was well crafted from a technical aspect and I respect the work of the actors and the special effects people - still. The film should not be made."
3,Mediocre,"This is a good sci-fi movie, but pales into insignificance in comparison to its predecessor, but if sci-fi is your thing, you'll probably enjoy it.My main criticism is that the character of Dr Chandra was changed from being an Indian to being a white American, which I found to be racist- there must have been some Indian-American actors !"
1,Unnecessary Sequel,"I wish they never made this move. ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"" was a great innovative, thought provoking and enigmatic stand-alone space epic. This film totally destroys Stanley Kubrick's vision in one fell swoop. It is the exact opposite of what Kubrick presented to the viewer in every respect. Uninspired sequels have a way of diminishing the impact of the original. Luckily ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"" still stands the test of time and remains unblemished by this inept sequel."
2,For the 2010 release of 2010.,"This is for the version of 2010 released in Nov. 2010.The movie is fantastic. However, the DVD is a piece of crap. It claims that it is enhanced for widescreen TVs, but is NOT. It's not anamorphic. It's a 4:3 letterbox presentation. The sound is also really quiet.I'd avoid this DVD, and try to get a Blu Ray instead. That one is probably better ."
2,Poor Blu-ray quality,I expected an incredible looking and sounding movie on blu-ray but didn't see much of a difference from the DVD version which is also poor quality. The blu-ray video is very grainy. This is the poorest blu-ray transfer I've seen yet. This was a total waste of money. The same goes for 2001.
3,Good movie but.....,"...what you get will not resemble the product shown. The product shown has a picture of the planet Jupiter and one of its moons in the background, Discovery floating in the foreground, with the monolith (full of stars) in between, movie by MGM studios. What you'll get will be the el cheapo snap case with Jupiter and the infant on the cover, movie by Warner Bros., which you can typically find at WalMart for $7.50.I thought I would get a decent copy of 2010 in a keep case, what I got was the bargain bin copy in a snap case that I paid too much for.The 3 stars is for the deception, not the movie. The movie rates 4 stars, with 2001 a strong 5. -kd5-"
4,The poetry is gone but much of the beauty remains.,"Of course it isn't as good. One guy was Kubrick and the other wasn't. However, this isn't 2001:REDUX. This is a completely different story! Arthur C. Clarke wrote a less ambiguous story, therefore the movie, if adapted faithfully, should be less ambiguous as well. The movie is, in fact, a faithful adaption in spirit. Many of the scenes and sequences from the book were excised but not at the expense of the story. It remains a beautiful picture with imaginative special effects from Dennis Mueren that is an entertaining reflection on the questions raised by a far superior movie."
4,My GOD it's full of Stars!,"Scheider,Mirren,Lithgow, and Bob(CE3K) Balaban contribute to this fine sequel that is more plot driven than its magnificent predecessor. I love the opening, which shows the report on Discovery Mission(submitted by Dr. Heywood Floyd).The first time I saw it I got chills as it is a very haunting scene.Other key scenes(Bowman's wife is greeted via 21st century television by the ""essence"" of Dave.Scene of Bowman's mother revived in hospital bed.Touching comic exchange between Lithgow and Russian.) Visual effects should have won an oscar.This is a fine production all-the-way around.Alright, maybe 2001 did not need a sequel(After all, Kubrick destroyed all plans and designs of sets and models after he finished 2001), but since it is here let us sit back, crank up the DVD digital Dolby and enjoy!"
4,The LSD-free version of 2001,"If you still haven't figured out 2001, this movie explains it for you. Much more Hollywood than its big brother, but you can't blame the stars or the special effects. Hint: NEVER watch a sci-fi movie in pan&scan format. The only real flaw is Kier Dullea's embarrassing ""something wonderful"" schtick, but Peter Hyams gets snaps for an attempt that merits more than one viewing. Not as bad as the ""professional"" reviewers say it is."
3,"It was good, but it should never have been made becaue....","It was good, as I said, but the movie kinda makes 2001 seems different because in the movie 2001 HAL was presented like a horror character, and in 2010 they take away our thoughts of awe, and change them into phyisical science. Although that would be the better way to see things, it is NOT the more interesting. Anyway, the movie was good becuase of the acting and how realistic it was, but trust me, the book is 10000x better, and the book keeps HAL as a horrific charicter in a way.READ THE BOOK, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO!! it is a must for science fiction lovers!"
2,2010: Space Farce?,"I thought this was a silly movie. I don't know what I thought I was expecting... but while 2001 made sense, 2010 didn't seem to do that."
3,"Good, better than the original.","'2010' has something that '2001' does not have; living, breathing human beings we actually care about. Roy Scheider steals the show in one of the few sequals that is actually better than the original. Forget Kubrick's soulless, heartless, overrated film."
1,Stinky sequel.,Words cannot express how much I disliked this movie. Read the book instead and see the original 2001 movie and read that book!
3,2010,"So CORNY. The guilt of modernity, the so-called shame of international discord.Crap. Yet, the leathery faced Scheider guides.No idea why this movie was made.-r.c."
1,Bad blu ray transfer,"I had seen a few reviews pertaining to 2010, but dismissed some customer comments about the blu ray quality. The sad part is it's true. This is by far the worst blu ray I have ever purchased. The strange part is that I had this movie on my HD DVR and the HD quality was good, but the blu ray transfer is horrible. I'll just try to unload it at a pawn shop and try to salvage something out of it. I have been fortunate in my blu ray purchases, this it the first mistake I made."
2,I can't watch this Poor Quality Blu-ray,"I really like the movie, the screen story and the actors. I've read the books (all of them in this series). It is great SF! But I can't watch the Blu-ray edition because the quality of the picture is so bad it's infuriating. There is so much noise that you can't tune it out. It's unavoidable and it gets in the way of enjoying a great story. The sound is just OK - barely. This is easily the worst quality Blu-ray I own or have ever seen. I gave it two stars because the story is darn good and acted out well. Too bad the technical people responsible for the transfer are working at a Jr. High School level - if that."
2,Boo-ray,"I've always like this movie and was delighted to get it for free via an Amazon deal on a new LG Blu-Ray player. Well I was a bit surprised when this was the first disc I put in that it was pretty bad compared to HD movies I watch on satellite... glad the reviews back this point up. As someone else said the effects scenes are fine, but the live action is grainy in a lot of places. Why bother putting this out if it's no better than the regular DVD?"
3,Transfer is not standard DVD resolution,"Once again, the stupid people responsible for doing transfers do an inferior transfer. Instead of using the standard DVD resolution of 720x480, they chose instead to use something more like 640x427. Honestly, I don't understand why they decide to do it this way, there should be plenty of room on the DVD, since they put the pan and scan version on the other side of the disc. I've run into a few DVDs like this and it pissed me off every time."
2,very poor Picture Quality,"until now I had only the DVD Version from 2010. The quality of this DVD was very bad. No anamorph 16:9, bad picture Quality and sound. So I to get excited about the fact, that the Blu-Ray apears. I can say that it is better than the DVD OK but it is the worst Blu-Ray I ever owned. The ""picture quality"" is blurred, grained and the sound has no dynamic. OK, thats the best quality you can earn but sorry, for Blu-Ray very bad."
3,Blu-ray version,"First of all this Blu-ray is a definite upgrade over the 1998 non-anamorphic DVD version (I can't speak for the intervening 2000 version). Considering the fact that this is an old catalog title I wasn't expecting too much but for $13.99 and free (Prime) shipping it was too much of a bargain to pass up. For the most part the film has a soft look but some scenes look fairly sharp. The movie is on a BD50 disc but the only extras are a featurette ""2010: The Odyssey Continues"" and the theatrical trailer. The TrueHD sound is an improvement over the old Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD but is only important in a few scenes like the one that involves 'air-braking' and the Jupiter explosion otherwise much of the movie is just dialog. This BD completes my Blu-ray set of the 2001 and 2010 movies so I'm satisfied for now."
4,a more conventional sequel to 2001,"2010 is a sequel to Kubrick's 2001, but don't expect this film to be anything like 2001. 2010 is a much more conventional film. Where 2001 was essentially a montage of beautiful images with little plot, 2010 has a rich plot and doesn't slow down. 2010 is probably more accessible to modern audiences. However, it's by no means a perfect film. Where 2001 was hard to understand, 2010 sometimes hits you over the head a bit too much with plot points (particularly bad is the voice over narration from Dr. Floyd's character telling viewers that he's scared). The camera focuses a bit too much on Dr. Floyd who comes across as a pretty plain character. Still, the plot is interesting and while it leaves some questions open, it does provide answers as well."
2,"Great movie, poor Blu-ray","I love this movie. The DVD transfer was pretty poor, so I was looking forward to the Blu-ray version. Unfortunately, it's only slightly better than the DVD."
3,2010,"If you like science fiction, then you will love this movie regardless of how old it is. Keep in mind, this movie is early 80's"
5,classic,"I have to say that this movie spooks me , but I really enjoyed it all the way through and watch it again and again."
5,great movie,this was a great movie a perfect sequel to 2001 a space Odyssey. Even though this is a older movie it still ida good movie to watch.
4,2010,"this is the first and only stanley kubrik film sequel.some other dude did it .basicly,another space crew is sent up to space to find out what went wrong with the space mission from 2001:a space odyssey.its a bit intellectual for children.it is very slowly paced also.the director,again,is NOT stanley kubrik,but this IS a sequel to his movie.it is essentialy the empire strikes back to 2001s star wars type start.i mean the original was the first sci-fi movie to set the standard in movie films.those who enjoy a journey into your mind will like this.a lot of the same problems from the first one are rediscovered so it is inevitable that a lot of the same things end up happening.this movie is a lot better than it gets credit for."
2,disappointing,"this movie was very disappointing after watching 2001, I honestly didn't think they could make a movie 20 years later and make it look worse than the a movie made in 1968. The conversion to Blu-ray is terrible, it looked like a low budget B movie. The story line was alright in retrospect, except it could have been done much much cooler, without all the 80's."
1,"A fairly interesting story, but...","The movie completely ruins Kubrick's masterpiece. Why? It takes the allure away from the original. It forces viewers to conform to Arthur Clark's view of what happened in 2001. For people who love being spoon-fed, and love not thinking, 2010 is a much better movie that 2001. But what makes Shakespeare so great, or the Bible such a literary masterpiece? Much of it is multiple interpretations readers can form in their own mind, which also carries over to film. In 2001, I was perfectly content believing that HAL really did have a problem and covered it up by killing crew members. Well, 2010 ruined that with the terrible story line of HAL being programmed to do it by 'the bad guys.' No thanks... stay away free-thinkers, this will ruin the original."
1,You'll regret watching this movie,"This was the worst effing movie I've ever seen. I loved 2001 which was a work of genius! This is in no way connected to the original. Whoever wrote this should be put to death. I initially read a comment stating that this was a continuation and was ""a thinkers movie"".. nope. If you like to think this will only make you mad. If you even remotely have an accurate opinion of the meaning behind the first, you'll recognize that there is no connection.. Sorry for the rambling, but I'm pissed! I only hope I can forget this movie so it doesn't ruin one of my all time favorites.As I did, I'm sure you'll watch anyway. When you do, please come back and agree. Others need to be saved and no royalty checks need to go out for this abomination."
2,"No ""2001"" sequel at all!","Count me with the folks who see this film as falling way, way short of ""2001."" I don't even think of it as a sequel, it so undermines all the intentional ambiguity, symbolism and directing style of the original. I agree with the viewer from Moscow that the re-casting of HAL subtracts substantially from the ""horrific"" elements of his character in ""2001."" It also negates the original film's cautionary speculations about man and technology. Some nifty special effects, yes... but c'mon folks... is that all it takes for you to go gushy over a movie?"
2,not very good,"besides the fact that this movie star the eternally annoying John Lithgow it is not very well done. it is a poor follow up to 2001, and unlike its predecessor, an impressive although somewhat dated look at the future with excellent special effects, this movie smacks of the cheesy 80's. the ending is interesting and this may have made a decent film, but it isn't. worth viewing if there's not much on besides Madonna movies."
1,Mystery Cloaked in Cliche,"For a sequel that's supposed to ""explain"" things, this wasn't much clearer than ""2001"". It doesn't tell why there were thousands of black slabs congregating on Jupiter, or where the message about Europa and universal brotherhood came from, etc. etc. So there are still a lot of questions at the end, but the vehicle for imparting this ambiguity is a film that incorporates a bucketful of cliched movie motifs, e.g. lots of fake ""countdown"" suspense (will the spaceman reach the spaceship/will Hal agree with the new program, all resolved just in the nick of time), outdated Cold War stuff, and lots of things ""get blown up real good"" as John Candy used to say.If I'm going to watch a movie that leaves me scratching my head, I'd rather it be something with some creativity and originality--like 2001--instead of something that's 100% formula like 2010."
3,2010- Good Sequel but POOR Blu Ray Transfer,"I just purchased 2010 in Blu Ray, and while I enjoyed the movie, I felt that the BLU RAY transfer was lousy. There were many artifacts and the picture was not sharp considering this was BLU RAY. The price however was low- but again- since this is BLU RAY I expected a razor sharp image. The sound was the saving grace (DTS MASTER)"
4,"Better than nothing, not great","I've always enjoyed 2010 and it finally gets a transfer that doesn't suck. However, it's the poorest looking film I have on Blu-ray. It's whoppingly better than the previous DVD release (for shame MGM) but it's in need of some cleanup. The ship board scenes are very grainy, and I'd swear I'm seeing superimposition lines for some of the special effects (especially when the probe to Io is launched). However, a lot of it does look pretty good, especially some of the later space scenes.The blu-ray release is essentially good enough that I can watch the film without wincing at how bad the video transfer is. And for the price, it's hard to argue that we should have gotten a restoration. But I still hope that one day this film will get a restoration because it's a really engrossing tale in its own right."
2,Dull and uninteresting,"It does surprise me how many people come to the rescue of this lame movie. In the view of most sci-fi fans, the Arthur C. Clarke books ran swiftly out of steam after the first one. Kubrick can be credited with making 2001 a feast for the senses.Given no Kubrick and the inferior plot of the second book, the movie was going to be difficult to put next to the first. It does however fail on its own merits. The endless exposition in Scheider's monotone carries you deep into space. He really is very boring in this slow, slow movie. And check out Helen Mirren's Russian Commander! The add-on plot-thickener mid-80's Cold War Revival doesn't help either.A non-anamorphic transfer makes it complete, so that the few nice parts aren't all that nice."
3,Not nearly as good as Kubrick's 2001,"2001 was much better. Special effects were good, but overall the movie was not in the same league as 2001. There was narration by the main character who ""explained"" what was going on whereas Kubrick would have made the viewer figure things out. This was annoying and lowered the overall quality of the movie. I don't think Kubrick meant for there to be a sequal and it is my opinion that the makers of this movie tried to stear the viewer away from meanings that Kubrick put forth."
1,Trash,This is badly made sequel to 2001 with little visual or plot continuity with the first film. The writing was horrible. The transfer to Blu-ray was horrible. Don't waste your time.
3,2001...2010,"Well....it complete the story of 2001...At least it dont end up like 2001...Nothing special of the package, just another blu ray disc."
1,Poor Quality,"I've been an movie collector for a long time. These days, with downloading I've reduced my budget. Getting 2010 on Blu-Ray was a real target for me. I finally got around to buying it and right off the bat I'm really disappointed with the quality. I've a film editor and I author Blu-Ray's myself. This is a very poor quality and I'm very displeased. It looks like they took the D1 or Beta Master and blew it up for HD. It's grainy and the colors are washed out."
2,poor blu-ray transfer,"Definitely a poorly quality product than ""2001: A Space Odessey"". I read somewhere that it's because of grainier film used in production. It shows. Cheap original filming makes for a lousy blu-ray transfer. Stick with your standard DVD version."
5,2010 a must havassey,great movie its a must have! i have 2001 a space odyssey too.it was in nice condition too!
4,To the world that will be faced in the future,Boundary at four another world beyonds of year.The theme seems not to change.I will feel the sense of crisis that might happen tomorrow.I want to be pleased with alive in four years.
2,Misses the mark,"I really think that this movie was soo bad that is good, terrible acting, it's completely excessivly boring, and it incredibly consufsing, but i don't know why i liked it."
5,Why oh why?,"Why would anyone buy a 1.33:1 Blu-Ray DVD? Anyone who has a Blu-Ray system is almost guaranteed to have a WideScreen TV. If they don't release this in atleast 16:9, this will bomb in the charts.It's a fantastic movie though. Very different to 2001."
3,Dobar pokusaj,Gledao sam davno ovaj film i zapravo mislim (koliko se sjeèam ) da je dobar pokuaj nastavka 2001.U svakom sluèaju ko voli SF filmove biti e zadovoljan i sa ovim.
3,The difference between ART CINEMA and ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES,"2001: A space odissey (five stars) is one of the best Art films ever made in history. 2010: The year we make contact was not intended to be Art cinema but of entertainment, because in our age (80's, 90's) art films are very rare and unwelcome, (think the deep footprint STAR WARS left). 2010 is not an ugly movie, but it's more for entertaining than for admire (the goal for art films). If you didn't know what is the difference between Art cinema (2001) and entertainment movies (2010) here it is the perfect sample."
3,2010 A Space Odyssey: The Year We Make Contact,This is a classic science fiction film and a good sequel to 2000 A Space Odyssey. As a movie it isn't one of the greatest ever but it is thought provoking and well worth seeing.
5,Superb follow-up to the first,"I found 2010 much easier to follow, largely due to the fact it had a conventional story line rather than seemingly random scenes that made little sense like its predecessor (a movie I appreciate, but still find somewhat confusing). The acting is superb and the plot makes complete sense. In the end, one actually feels attached and sympathetic to Discovery. If you liked the first, this will probably seem less stellar; but if you found the first thought-provoking, albeit confusing, then this movie will help you understand its predecessor substantially."
2,A very dissaponting sequel to a true classic,"Well, 2001 was the premier science fiction film and without doubt one of the most ambitious movies ever made. This movie, said to be it's sequel, fials to reach the revolutional geniousness of the fisrt one, and stays as a typical boring scifi-piece. Better plot wouldn't harm..."
2,"Blu-ray is very, very grainy","If you buy the Blu-ray of 2010 hoping for a stunning transfer, you will be disappointed. The image is very grainy most of the time ... you could grate cheese on the image quality. And the special effects look awful in this tranfer ... you can see stars through Helen Mirren's head and big boxes around the spacewalk characters. A few of the closeups will give you Blu-ray quality, but for the most part it looks like a not-so-great DVD. Buyer beware."
2,good movie bad bluray,"I received a Bluray player for Christmas and had a list of movies in mind for immediate purchase. I really like 2010 the movie and wanted to see it in closest quality to the original release.The blue ray remastering of this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. Grainy, blurry. The extras shot on HD were often better quality than the movie converted from film.I watched this right after watching 2001 which is one of the best blurays I have ever seen... which made the movie look even worse."
3,"Film: 5 stars, NOT Enhanced For Widescreen: 3 stars","The box says one thing, the reality is something else. You are not getting the 400 lines of resolution in widescreen/letterbox 2.35:1 (in 16:9) with this dvd, but rather something closer to 200 lines, which is pretty awful. To make matters worse, the print's in dire need of remastering and digital touch ups. It's grainy and the colors & contrasts are not calibrated properly. I'd recommend THX standardized mastering. The optical matte boxes are visible in a number of shots and need to be digitally eliminated for future releases of this film. The quality of this dvd release is simply unacceptable for this caliber of film."
4,Very worthwhile sequel.,"If you haven't seen this on video, TV or on it's original cinema release, then treat yourself to a well-crafted, intelligent SF movie (and what a rarity that is)."
3,"It was ""The Year We Make Contact.""","I love this movie. It is not ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (the quintessential Sci-Fi experience ever!), but it does give us continuity by explaining more about what happened in the first story and it leaves itself open to continue again. I was disappointed with the Blu Ray. It is probably because of the transfer from DVD as oppose to the film negative. Also, the movie company probably did not see the value in investing too much time to raise the bar on it 's only sequel to this ongoing journey (which there is three more books after 2010).I would love to see the next three books envisioned for the ""big screen!"" Only time will tell.MIG OUT."
3,"Not 2001, but interesting and enjoyable","This is not on the same level as 2001... but it is a good film for those who were mystified by 2001, since it answers some of the questions posed by the first film very nicely. Unfortunately, the silly cosmic greeting card from Europa at the end of the film is a major disappointment and the casting of an overly emotional Roy Scheider instead of William Sylvester (who played Heywood Floyd in 2001) was a major miscast in my opinion. William would have played the role with more ""cool"" and ""control"" as an authentic scientist-astronaut would have really been for such a mission. Still, the effects and visuals are good and the film is enjoyable. Keir looks great as Bowman and the metaphysical touches are interesting."
1,What were they thinking?,Its predecessor was a milestone film. This attempt to cash in on the popularity of 2001 simply ruins it by explaining away the mystery. A terrible idea all around. I wish I had never seen it.
3,Blu-Ray - Not as good as 2001,"I got 2001 as the first Blu-Ray movie I purchased... and that PQ was excellent thruout! So, being apparently naive, I made additional purchases of Blu-Ray movies and television among which was this 2010 movie. I had read the poor reviews and the only reason I did buy this product was that, when I put my DVD version of this movie into my BR player to try out the upscaling... I was quite disappointed as the picture was shrunk on the screen and I had to use zoom to get it widescreen. However, in using the zoom, the PQ became so bad it was unwatchable... But, I am somewhat happy to report that the BR product (this product review) was much better than trying to upscale the older DVD version. The interior shots are still quite poor when compared to 2001, but the external ""space"" scenes were much clearer, pretty good in fact... so all in all, I give this BR version of the film, 2010, a 3 stars rating... they could do much, much better. But they probably won't."
3,2010,"I was please with the arrival of the 2010 DVD. The only problem was that the DVD was scarched on one side. As it worked out...this was okay..and the other side of the double disk worked perfectly. This was a gift for a 9 year old...whom is deeply involve in old movies. And, perfect for the 2010 New Year."
3,Move over Jaws,This was a decent movie. It is the sequel to the orignal Space Odyssey. In the move Russian and the American search for the ship discover to figure what went wrong and why the computer went haywire and killed all the crew. This has a good plot but not a lot of action. The main charter is pladded by Roy Shider better known as peter Brody in the spingtinglin Jaws and its first sequel. Richard Drifous is also in it I think. If you are lucking for a high action sciencfiction movie I recommend Zarkoor the invader or Predator or Alien movies.
3,Cheesy flim makes bad follow up to 2001,"This movie isn't 2001 at all, in this movies space ships go Whurring by, peter hyams did a bad job on this one, he completely changed the perfect story line Clarke set up for him, gosh that was a bad idea"
4,Classic Enjoyable Entertainment,"You need both Stanley Kubrick's ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and this one to fully appreciate. I had issues setting the aspect ratio through my new Sony 3D/Blue Ray Player. Quality nonetheless. Recommend!!!"
1,2010 DVD (2010 edition),"Amazon is wrong. This is not 1.85 or wide screen. The original movie is 2.35, and this DVD has that aspect ratio as well. However, it is NOT anamorphic wide screen, it's standard 4:3 frame with letter boxing. TERRIBLE! Plus the transfer quality is bad as well. Glad I only paid $5 for it but wish I had not bought it at all. More shameful behavior from Warner Bros, the worst movie studio that exists."
4,Almost a 'space odyssey',"The '2010' sequel to the 2001: Space Odyssey almost hits the mark.It is a quality production without the building excitement of '2001', but good enough for space exploration buffs. Had I paid today's prices at a theatre I would have been very disappointed.Best from me relative to any movie, is that once I have seen it I don't feel it was a waste of $$ and that I don't feel I wasted my time watching it. This movie's ok on both counts."
4,Worthwhile trip into space,"Many people hate 2010 simply because it isn't 2001. But there can be only one Stanley Kubrick and one Peter Hyams, who directed the sequel. While retaining narrative continuity with tghe original, this film boldly goes in it's own direction. I found it entertaining and thought provoking, albeit in different ways than 2001. Overall, a worthwhile cinematic experience.I think the blu-ray is just fine, given some of the reviews I was prepared for the worst but what I have received was more than satisfactory.Recommended."
4,Probably as good as it will get...,"I've always loved this film, but let's face it, it's never gotten much love from WB. The standard DVD is non-anamorphic and just doesn't look very good, especially on a large screen. The Blu-Ray is a big improvement in this regard. However, I doubt much (if any) work was done in the way of restorative work to the master, and there are no extras beyond those found on the standard DVD.All that said, it's been priced very fairly, and I DON'T see Warner re-releasing it in two years with a sparkling new transfer and a boatload of new extras. So, if you like this film, don't fear the ""double dip"" - just scoop it up, because this is probably as good as it will ever get, at least until the NEXT video format rolls around!"
3,Disappointing transfer - Blu-Ray,"This review is of the blu-ray. Basically, if you have the DVD of this film, just keep it and enjoy a good sci-fi film. The blu-ray is extremely grainly for a 'hi def' film. The only difference is in the purly special effect scenes, where a higher quality stock of film was used and holds up to a high def treatment. The rest of the scenes, any interior scenes, the scenes on earth, etc, are all grainy. Basically, there was no work done to clean up the print at all. There is the occasional hair stuck in a corner and other artifacts. As far as special features... there is one featurette, and that is all. No commentary. In conclusion, if you do not own it, go ahead and get it, but, if you own it already, you will not see any real improvement on getting the blu-ray edition."
4,"No classic, but still very good","Obviously, this movie does not compare to 2001: A Space Odyssey. But I still greatly enjoyed it. It is better than the average movie. The movie has some very tense scenes and has some nice shots of Jupiter. I would give in ***1/2 stars out of four. Especially good for readers of the book. A very good movie!(I just wrote a big, long review for 2001, so I'm too wiped out to write a good one for this one.)"
2,Nothing Much,"When I saw 2001: a space odyssey I thought it was one of the most awe inspiring sci-fi movie in existence. Because if this I was expecting quite a lot of 2010. I was sorely disappointed. It was extremely slow, had a quite boring USA vs Russia theme throughout and nothing truly great happened until the end. This movie does not make you think - unlike the original. I then read the book of 2010 and found that it was excellent. What went wrong with the film? Around a third of the plot was cut and the Russia vs USA theme was added for no apparent reason. The characters were destroyed and all of the humour and suspense was forgotten. It is sad that what could have been am excellent movie was let down due to sloppy script and directing. The ironic thing is that 2001 has aged less than this movie! I think I will just try to forget that a movie was made of this excellent book - it lets me read the rest of the series in peace."
3,"Great movie, but not Blu-Ray worthy just yet.","This is still one of my favorite movies, but aside from the crispness of the video (which to me differs very little if at all from the DVD), I was put off by the fact that there are no special features different from what was in the DVD version. In other words, all you pay for is just a barely noticeable better screen and sound quality, but absolutely nothing else. Unfortunate. Perhaps a minifeature on Galileo's odyssey as it circled Jupiter, or a retrospective look back at the opinions then and comparison with the realities of now? There is a vast untapped resource of information that could have been included. Sadly, it wasn't."
2,Mixed Bag,"I like this film and came close to buying it on various formats over the years. When the blu arrived, I thought: This is it. Well, MGM really dropped the ball on this one. Parts of the film look fine, but some of the effects shots are a disaster. It looks like they used unfinished elements (?). Color is WAY off in many composite shots (and full of pulsating digital artifacts). There are also a number of painfully obvious traveling mats. Jupiter looks too gaudy, like a big jaw breaker (instead of soft and mysterious, as in 2001), but that may be the way it looked theatrically. What a shame they didn't go the extra mile on this transfer."
4,Pass that bottle to me,"This CD features the highlights from Atlantic Records first five years of operation. This is rhythm and blues music from the pre-rock and roll era. To be honest, the very earliest cuts here are not that exciting to me. They are mostly rather generic sounding r&b instrumentals. The CD really picks up steam around the second half of the album. With great vocal groups like the Clovers and the Cardinals, and great soloists like Ruth Brown and Joe Turner, it doesn't get much better than that. If you are interested in the history of rhythm and blues, this is a good place to start."
1,Dull and Boring,"I've read multiple books by Phoebe Conn and I must say that this is definitely NOT one of her best. This book seemed to be a waste of time and money, unless you have an over-abundance of either.The main characters were described farely well, but that was all. Eden Sinclair, the main female character, was supposed to have high morals and an extreme amount of passion, etc. However, I could not find an ounce of either. She married within a week of the death of her ""one true love"", and to his selfish nephew. She was in his bed the very night of his death.The romantic scenes left a lot to be desired. Their romance included kissing passionately and then falling asleep. All that Eden and Raven, her dead husband's nephew, have going for each other is ""passion"", if you could really call it that.I would not purchase this book if you can find it at the library or a friends."
1,Very Disappointed ((,"The main reason we bought this translator is that it included Tagalog Filipino....But, once we got it, we discovered that it doesn't have the talking option in Tagalog, only in English and Chinese????..................and when we asked to return it via online, we were told that all sales are final and they wouldn't allow us to return the translator.....Because of those two elements I don't recommend purchasing anyone purchase this product from 11Translator, VERY DECEIVING PRACTICE."
4,Atlantic in the sixties,"One of the lesser c.d.'s in the series. There are some classics, and some filler. The price was great, and super service"
2,"AccuMassage broke quickly, DaVinci is very firm","The AccuMassage was *great*, but it broke within a week or two, right where a handle threaded into the ""massage"" part, so the design appears to be rather weak. The DaVinci tool is large enough that it wasn't comfortable to use anywhere but my neck when resting on the floor (as the pictures suggest). It could possibly work on top of a bed, with a pillow.In the end, after buying these (and other expensive) self-massage tools, I've gone back to using a pair of tennis or lacrosse balls taped together to work up and down my spine, and tennis ball in a sock (as a handle) to maneuver into small, painful areas. For larger areas, I use a foam-padded PVC pipe (to replace the foam roller that compressed unevenly). You might want to try these inexpensive alternatives for self-massage. I don't recommend this set of tools."
4,worth the effort,"I enjoy reading physics texts, but I had never really enjoyed reading transcripts of lectures (in any subject). This book, however, was definitely worth the time and effort to read.Even though most of the concepts are simple, basic physics, I still learned things. Most wonderful of all were the many times a lightbulb clicked on in my mind when I saw how simply and cleverly Faraday constructed his experiments. These guys really had it together.Though somewhat devoid of helpful diagrams, the text of this work is often enough to give the reader a good idea of how Faraday was conducting his experiments and presentation. I think the biggest detractor is that you really have to slog through the work and use your imagination to figure out what he's describing.My only wish is that I could have been there to see these lectures myself. Sounds like quite the demonstration."
2,The Chemical History of a Candle,My godmother brought me this book because I had to read it for school. This book was not amusing to me and to me his lectures were boring just like some teachers. At first I had interest in the book and then later on through the book I didn't want to read it anymore. You really have to love science and chemistry to read this book. I'm a junior in highscool so I think a lot of other teenagers will agree with me.
4,Works fine for me,"I've had this mini keyboard for about 6 months now and it works consistently without incident. Granted I only use it with the web browser and to chat in RFOM. I just plugged it in and it worked. It does make the controller front heavy and I do get a bit nervous shaking off bullseye tags without feeling like I'm going to send it flying. Although, to date this hasn't happened. The size is a huge pro. My wife wouldn't stand for a full size keyboard in the living room. The only reason I am giving it four stars is that I wish it was bluetooth."
1,Doesn't work with FFXI,"The Mad Catz thumbpad works fine with the PS3 web browser, but it doesn't work at all with Final Fantasy XI (FFXI) on-line.Considering I bought it to use it for chat and gameplay in FFXI, this is a huge disappointment.Other keyboards, such as Logitech's PS2/PS3 USB keyboard, work fine with both the PS3 web browser and FFXI.As soon as you start up FFXI, however, the Mad Catz thumbpad stops working, its LED starts blinking furiously, and it never syncs up with the receiver which is attached to the PS3. Very frustrating!"
1,Total Crap!!!,"This thing is a total piece of junk,it doesnt work simply put it never links to the the ps3 or the pc or anything,avoid it like the plage...it wouldnt surprise me that those saying its great could be ppl planted by madcatz..it wouldnt be the firt time they do that tough..."
3,an interesting film,"I rather enjoyed this film. I'll not post any spoilers but to say the other reviewer is too much like most other reviewers - picking a film apart rather than simply suspending belief and enjoying a flick. Asylum Days has a very creepy feel throughout. It's not a great film, but it serves well enough for entertainment value."
1,The absolute worst movie ever!,"Do not waste your time, money or brain cells by even inserting this movie into your DVD player. It's horrible in every way. I can't believe I actually paid $1 for this."
3,disappointed,"I agree with barbara,grandson was very upset.Now I can't find the other monsters to complete his set.A picture of just the three items would have helped.YuGiOh Capsule Monsters Game Booster Pack"
1,DISAPPOINTED,I was VERY disappointed with this product. The picture that it shows is a lot more characters in it. The product only comes with 3 characters. My 10 year old son was very disappointed. The characters are also extremely tiny compared to what the product is advertised. I will NOT buy another product from this store again.
4,It works,It kept me chuckling throughout and kept my 4 year old's attention so I guess its a pretty swell family flick.
1,Waste of time...mostly,"Except for the section at the show where the chickens sing...F*** You written by Cee Lo Green, manure is more worthy than this ...production...If I could give it -5 I would."
1,Really bad,"What is wrong with these reviewers? This was a total waste of 5 bucks. It only confirmed that, like the storyline, the muppets ARE 'dead' like Richman says. I miss Jim Henson."
1,a couple of laughs...,"and these were for the adults. The kids (7, aged 4-10)couldn't tell me one thing that they really liked. The muppets need help. They miss Henson, so do I."
1,Save your money and your time,A poor follow-up to the Muppet legacy. Overly long songs by Segel that aren't funny. Not worth the time or money.
1,What is this???,"So, two stupid humans and one stupid muppet doing stupid things.This movie is boring even for my 8 years-old nephew.I mean, who's the target of this movie? Old people who saw the original Muppet's Show 30 years ago or young people who prefer non-puppetish movies?I liked the Muppet's Show when I was a kid.. but.. Disney turned the Muppets franchise into a musical-stupidity-musical-stupidity endless cycle."
4,"good movie, scratchy streaming","This was a very nice kids movie, with funny and sad parts. I loved it from start to finish. Cute songs (Muppet or Man is def. my favorite song) and great acting. The only con with this is that if you stream it from Amazon, it will be kind of scratchy and dithered. Go buy it on DVD or Blu-ray, cause it will be clearer, and it's a good movie."
3,Ho Hum,It was no Jim Henson and Frank Oz or Brian Henson production. The movie was lacking The Muppet's special touch. Watch the original movie or series.
1,Poor,The bluray disc never worked. I would return it if i felt I had a chance of having it remedied.
1,Sequel Suggestion,"I think the next installment penned by Jason Segel should be the virtues of the collective, and praise for a muppet ""Dear Leader""No seriously, the villain of the movie should have been the FCC for destroying childrens programing. I'm glad I grew up when you could enjoy Saturday programing like a kid should, relatively devoid of educational value. If Laugh Olympics had a polictical point of view it was lost on me. Or Pinelope Pit Stop had a feminist agenda (it might have, I was just a kid) I didn't know it.Of course the fact I don't enjoy musicals like I did when I was a kid could be another of the reasons I didn't get past the first 23 minutes. The lyrics and choreography where terrible.(Queue maniacal laughter) Mwhaa hahahaha."
2,"Starts strong, but a rather depressing story-line.","Beginning with one of the happiest, and most uplifting songs I've ever heard in my life, titled ""Life's A Happy Song,"" this film was headed in all the right directions. Instead, it takes a dark and rather depressing turn, doing for the Muppets what ""Babe: Pig in the City"" did for that franchise.Jason Segel and Amy Adams are very likable as the main actors, and the new ""whistling"" Muppet is great, but it would have been good to see some of the funnier character like Ratzo, Peppe the Prawn, and Gonzo doing some funny bits.There are so many great characters to work with here, they really missed a golden opportunity to bring back a winning franchise.Next time, maybe Disney will let their Pixar team tell the story..."
3,Great movie - beware download restricted,"This is a great movie. Beware however that the digital copy can only be downloaded in the USA or Canada. If you do not live in one of these countries you will not be able to download the digital copy, so just buy the regular DVD instead."
5,The Muppets,"High quality video, no problems loading, user friendly interface. Movie was very enjoyable tribute to the classic Muppet films, any fan of the Muppets will enjoy this movie."
5,Such a Great Movie!,"I hesitated to watch this because I was afraid of what they'd do with such a beloved franchise, but then I finally caught it on cable and fell in love with it. My kids are now Muppets fans, and we can't stop singing the songs. Loved IT>"
4,"Great movie, horrible packaging!","I absolutely LOVE this movie, so I bought the Blu Ray. The second time I went to watch my new movie, the disc broke!! I have never had a disc break on me before. The packaging holds the disc so tightly, I could not get it out! ...and then it snapped in half! What a waste of money!"
5,Great family movie!!!!,My kids love watching this movie! We watch it as our family movie night with popcorn. I even downloaded it to my kindle and the kids love watching ti in the car for long rides.
2,Would not recommed,We expected the movie to funny. There were parts but not as many as we had heard. It would have been better if it we set at the theater the whole time with shows like the tv show.
5,Such a great movie!,Love watching this movie over and over again! The music is great and the storyline captures the heart of children and adults alike!
4,The Muppets DVD,"I am a huge Muppet fan so when I saw this in the theater, I knew I'd have to have it. Nothing will ever compare to the original Muppet Movie and shows, but I really like this one. There is a scene in what would have been Kermit's office at the studio... very touching as the character was looking around at all the stuff, especially Jim Henson's photo."
2,Poor,"I didn't like this movie much. It was allegedly a kid's movie, which we showed it to my 4 year old. Maybe it was too old for him, and too juvenile for my wife and I. Stupid story line, bad acting."
3,"Misses the magic, but still fun","Well, with only Dave Goelz (Gonzo) the remaining member of the big five Muppet performers of the Seventies (founder Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson and Richard Hunt being the others) taking part in this production, many of these lovable characters are missing their original voices, and longtime fans will definitely feel a sense of unbalance. Still, this movie remains diverting entertainment, and the songs aren't bad at all, thanks to the talents of Flight Of The Conchords man Bret McKenzie. I could list a dozen things about the film that don't quite work, but in the end, this a good film for kids, and at the very least might make a few of them take an interest in watching DVDs of ""The Muppet Show"" with their nostalgic parents."
5,muppet movie,"Great movie clean and wholesome it's a hit loved it good family fun, Go out and buy it you wont be sorry for the whole family"
3,"Good, simple fun","A good family movie where you will smile throughout. However, it is not special in any way and it does not make you want to watch it again."
3,Disappointing Muppets,"I always loved the Muppets. I found this movie to be greatly disappointing. There were a few good laughs but they were far apart and not enough. An interesting thing - when the movie is paused, it goes to an ""intermission"" that changes every time it is paused. I gave it a plus for that. Many of the characters have a very brief appearance and don't have any real role."
4,This was pretty dang good.,My wife and I rented this movie and we had a great time watching it. Plus Amy Adams is very pretty.
4,Family friendly,"Oh this is so cute and those muppets are art in motion. Good story line, lots of conflict, yearning and adventure all rolled up into one fun little movie. Who couldn't love the muppets?"
3,okay movie,This is an okay movie. I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it at the movies with my family. It is funny but typical mullets. Got some giggles too.
2,"Big, bad oil strikes again!","As a longtime Muppet fan, I was really disappointed in some of the voices (Fozzie) being too far off. Also, must every Hollywood endeavor have to attack ""big oil""? Try to get anywhere without it."
1,another disney flop,"Disneys first flop was a movie called Tex, the first movie I walked out of the theater on. Then came George of the jungle, both of them, and Underdog. Now it sounds like they are making another flop with the Lone Ranger.All this movie did was make a sick fun of the other muppet movies. They had to put the rainbow song in it to have at least one good song in the whole movie. I wish they didn't put so much importence on the movie if miss piggy wasn't there. I wish they would do a good muppet movie without that character in it at all. What Disney should have done, besides get a better writter, was make a Muppet Adventure and forget this thing about the gang braking up."
1,AWFUL,"The Plot was awful (and unrealistic, given the location of L.A.).The Musical numbers were awful (and made me want to shove cotton in my ears).The acting was terrible. The Muppets weren't even believable.Nothing about this movie was in any way enjoyable for Adults, and even the kids hated it, that's how bad it was.In a word, AWFUL."
1,Muppet Mess!,"I've been a Muppet fan since I was a kid, and I was stunned of how bad this film was. It didn't have the spark of a True Muppet Movie. Muppet Movies are supposed to have a mix between Kid & Adult Humor, this had None! Not to mention... the Voice Actor's have changed, but there's no control over that :( but still. Also! NO RIZZO! You CAN NOT have a Muppet Movie without Rizzo! And the Plot of the movie... not that good. Sorry but I'm saving my money on this one and purchasing all the other Extraordinary Muppet Movies!"
1,Terrible,"every single aspect of this movie was an embarrassment to the original muppet showterrible pace extremly rushed ending ""so cliche its not even funny"", the worst jokes ive ever heard in my life sing a longs that last for way to long characters with no like value what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Gotta love the muppets,This movie is just a fun time movie about bringing back the muppet. If you like the muppets then you should like this movie.
3,Definately for older children,"Our two granddaughters are 2 1/2 and almost 3 ~ this was for older children :~{ Guess, we'll have to hold on to it for the future :}"
3,had funny moments,"really not the best movie but any muppet fan should definitly watch it once, kids that like music will enjoy it"
5,AMAZING!,"Bought this one because it comes with all the copies you could need or want. My wife and I love the movie and the soundtrack. It is currently a favorite for our kids too who are all under 6 years old. It is amazing and exciting that it is possible for Hollywood to make a clean, funny, fun, entertaining movie still. Buy this and enjoy it over and over."
3,So-so Movie,Needed better choreography or at least more complex choreography. The best part was the Muppet Show towards the end of the movie. The movie suffered from a bad script/story up until that point. The whole human/muppet brother back story was kind of lame. This movie could have and should have been better.
2,Muppets deserve better than this drivel,"We had just watched the original Muppet Movie for the first time since it was new in the theaters. This 2012 stumble is just plain annoying. All the fun and quirky was removed and what is left is petrified cliches tied together by rehashed songs. Most not even good for a chuckle. The only GOOD Muppet was Jack Black and he isn't even a puppet. This movie is too boring for children, too irritating for adults. Who is this for? I gave my copy away."
3,Muppet Mania,"I remember watching the muppet show on my family's old crappy console TV when I was a kid (now the kids get 1080p HD huge flat screens and blu-ray, haha). My kids didn't really know who the Muppets were, as they're not on TV anymore. I would say this film is more for younger kids. BTW, my fave character is Beaker. Meep. It's not a great movie, but it's entertaining for the kiddos, some songs, dancing, etc"
3,MY GRADE: B minus.,"The Muppets are back. The tale begins with a younger and unknown Muppet idolizing the old cast and inspiring Kermit the Frog to come out of retirement and get the old gang back together. Once they're together the old gang works at earning enough funding to reopen their theater. There's singing and music and lots of nostalgia for those who remember the original series but where's the humor? The movie reminded me of one of the more flat episodes compared to the good ones that made laugh hard in several spots. Cameos by several known actors. It was fun enough but it didn't have the magic of the original series. Don't worry about my opinion in affecting the next one, though. I'm sure there will be one as it won Best Song in 2012 by the Academy Awards. The budget for this film was $45M and it made a tad over $145M.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; HUMOR: C; SINGING/MUSICALS: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B minus."
3,Vanilla Custard.....,"I love the Muppets. Loved the weekly show and especially Muppets Treasure Island. I wanted The Muppets to be a hilarious, witty movie. What I saw was ok, but it felt a lot like a rehash of The Muppet Movie and The Muppets Take Manhattan with the same ""We need to put on a show but nobody wants us"" theme. It was sort of bland and sweet like vanilla custard. The best part of the movie was the Mahna Mahna song at the end.My dream for the Muppets would be for Disney to get some really great writers like John Lasseter & Andrew Stanton, the guys who did Toy Story and Finding Nemo, to do the Muppets next movie. Make them great again, and one of those movies people of all ages will love. I think the Muppet show and characters have huge potential, and I hope Disney will find a way to bring that out. Mahna Mahna!"
2,Wish I had rented,Wish I had rented this movie instead of buying it... My 8 year old liked it but it didn't have the same humor of the Muppets I grew up with. Just seemed like all the human actors were over exaggerating their parts.
4,There's Enough Humor for Kids & Adults,"I actually bought the Muppets on DVD this week. I haven't been a Muppet film in probably twenty years. I recall watching a few of the movies and The Muppet Babies cartoon series, but I have lost touch with these cute characters. I remember seeing this movie advertise at the theater last year and I thought it would be horrible due to the fact that Jason Segel is in it. Surprisingly, I wasn't annoyed with his character, even though it is unbelievable that Amy Adams' character actually liked him. All the Muppet characters are back, but some of them could have had more screen time, like Fozzie Bear - who didn't have much to do. The movie is cute for kids with enough humor for adults to enjoy it as well."
5,As good as it gets!,"I'll make this short and sweet. I fondly remember the Muppets from my own childhood, and after reading some of the many stellar reviews for this new version, I brought my 6 year old daughter to see it. Not that she wanted to...seeing as how she had no clue who this motley collection of puppets were, I wasn't surprised. In line to get tickets, I overheard other kids, with a familiar sounding whine, ""But i dont wanna see the Muppets! I wanna see the Chipmunks...""My daughter is one of those who HATES admitting when she was wrong about something, anything. But after this film ended, she had a new love. And as the days passed, the memories of the film grew stronger. I purchased the soundtrack on CD, and she was addicted. It was highly gratifying to see her demonstrate such wonderful taste! This is one of those rare 'childrens' films that plays just as well to adults, without talking down to kids. It's a fantastic film, and one of the year's best, kids or adults."
3,Membership required for soundtrack - sad,"I loved the movie, was looking forward to getting the soundtrack - reason I bought this version of DVD release. But I will not and do not want a Disney Movie Rewards account and find it VERY POOR marketing to force one to have an account to get the soundtrack that one has paid for - very cheesey. And that this is not clearly stated before purchase is cheesey X2."
5,Welcome back.,"The Muppets is full of catchy music and lots of laughs for our young family (kids are 4 and younger). The three-disc collection was a great value ($26). The only thing I wish I would have known is that the digital copy is stored online at Disney and not directly on our computer. Not a big deal, except we need internet access to watch it (had considered using ipod to allow kids to watch on long road trips). I'm glad the Muppets are back!"
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I was a big fan of ""The Muppets."" I am a Jason Segal fan. To say that I was disappointed in this movie is an understatement. The concept may have been okay, but the writing and execution just plain miss the mark. The film is really uneven, and basically vacillates between ""meh"" and bad/boring. It does not capture the fun/funny essence of the original TV series or movies.If you enjoyed the originals, don't waste your time or money."
5,Great,Recommend this product to anyone. It is a very funny movie (a lot better than I thought it would be)!
4,Nice Blend of Human and Puppet,"Positives:I wasn't sure if the human and puppet (OK, muppet) interaction would look natural but credit to the writers, director, actors and muppets for making the blending of their two worlds seem believable. Success is when you start responding to them as living creatures. Typical muppet antics and humor dialogue for all age although a bit more for the older crowd as in the tele series.Negatives:I would have liked to have seen more muppet comedy, music and interaction with contemporary stars. The ending was also a little anticlimactic."
4,A great return,"It was great to see the muppets back and introduce them to my son, a big seller was the soundtrack which I listen to far more than I have watched the movie, but all in all a great deal."
4,Fun nostalgia trip,"This relaunch of the Muppets was obviously a trip down nostalgia lane. I think by and large it succeeds. The film sets up a clever way to get the Muppets back together, both acknowledging their long absence and making a story out of it. The villains and story seem like they could have come out of the 1980s classics. Best of all, we get some of the Muppets' classic humor, including breaking the 4th wall. If I had one disappointment, it was with the human actors. Jason Segal is relatively new, but Amy Adams I'd always loved for her unbridled energy and enthusiasm. However, they're mostly used in the song and dance numbers. In fact, I think the movie tried to do too much by forcing their love drama into the movie along with all of the other plot elements. Still, overall I hope this movie does bring the Muppets back to prime time and that we see more of our favorite green frog."
3,just ok,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it was only ok. W watched the whole movie, which is why i gave it 3 stars (we could get though it because it wasn't painful), but i would have rather spent my time watching something else."
5,Loved it,"I really enjoyed this. I saw all the movies as a child and this both taps into what we loved about it then and is clever for us as adults. I loved seeing where all the Muppets were working now and enjoyed the ""getting back together"" montage. The movie gets really good once the Show starts though! recommended!"
2,EH,"Not much plot. Not really worth watching overall. A few cute songs, but basically a waste of time and talent."
1,Perfect if you like cigarette smoke,"Package came and totally smelt of cigarette smoke. Movie was new and unopened, but the inside of the package and movie has a horrible stale smoke smell. Totally nasty."
1,Awful,"I used to love the Muppets. However, after seeing this awful movie, I feel like watching the old ones again, which I haven't done in years. Maybe I used to love crap or maybe the Muppet movies used to be great and now all they could come up with was this stupid piece of junk. What's with all that ridiculous singing and dancing?"
2,Red Box it first.,"Rent it first at Red Box, in the extremely unlikely event that you actually enjoyed this movie, buy it. I was totally disappointed in this flick. On a side note, if you ever get to Disneyland (California Adventure) or Walt Disney World (Disney Studios) be sure to check out the 3D Muppets show. It's great with a lot of gags!"
1,Dumb,I thought it might be nice to go back to the good old days of the Muppets and look at this movie. It was a big disappointment and I stopped my viewing of the movie after about a half hour.Amy Adams and Jason Segel were dull and as plastic as the plot material and I cannot believe this was a Disney production.
2,predictable,i saw this movie last night and was i little hesistant at first because the commercial didn't look that good.and i was right the movie was bland and the jokes were weak. it had very few haha moments but those were not laughs just a chuckle. u all know the guy gets the girl. but to me i didn't feel the chemistry between jason lee and julia stiles it was pretty bad. so overall if u like typical movies this is your movie. if you want a little more intricate movie don't waste your time
4,now what to do!,"a good movie about a guy who discovers he's in love with his fiances cousin.if you like rom-coms watch it,and don't be put off by some of the low ratings."
2,typical young romantic comedy,"There's nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a million times before. Very predictable and too much attempted humor that falls flat. A few funny parts here and there if this is the first romantic comedy you've ever seen in your life. I gave this movie 2 stars because of the very talented lead actors, Jason Lee and Julia Stiles. Normally they choose their movies a little better. Selma Blair seems to fit here role perfect. She's a good actress, but all her charactors are basically the same. If it weren't for these actors, this movie would only get 1 star.Jason Lee plays a guy who got drunk at his bachelor party and wakes up with one of the dancers. (Julia Stiles) She happens to be the cousin of the bride (Selma Blair). That's basically all you need to know to figure out how the entire movie plays out.There are tons of better romantic comedies out there. Invest elsewhere."
2,A Guy Thing Not A Good Thing,There were good actors&actresses in this movie. But the movie didn't make good use of them. The laughs were passable at best. Jason Lee who was funny and terrific in Heartbreakers. Performance was deadpan&uninteresting. Selma Blair in my opinion made the movie funny . Julia Stiles was terrific but the movie rely on her too much to make the movie. So rent it don't buy it.
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed ""A Guy Thing"". It's not going to win any awards, but it is funny and light-hearted. Good for a night's entertainment when there's nothing better to watch on."
1,Um...,"I won't say much about this one. I don't care what you `My Name Is Earl' fans have to say about it, this film forever killed Jason Lee for me. It made me hate him. To be fair, I remember nothing about this film. It was that bad. The plot is forgettable and predictable and full of clichés. I love Julia Stiles. Yes, she has absolutely no career at the moment, but she deserved one. She had such fire and spunk and undeniable charm. I seriously was in love with her at one point. I would welcome her back to cinema with open arms. She is the only favorable memory of have of this film (that, and Selma Blair's backside, which is always favorable). The gags are ridiculous and the whole premise is just begging to be picked apart and crucified. In fact, I forwent paying attention all together and made-out with my girlfriend in the empty theater."
3,Get Over It!,"Ok, so it's not Oscar worthy material? I'm sure you saw the previews--it is what it is--a sweet movie about not going for what's safe. And come on--Julie Hagarty is hilarious-- Do not watch this movie if you're looking for something deeper--it's fun, sweet romantic fluff which we all need once & a while. The commentary is a lot of fun & you have to play the interactive quiz."
2,hard to watch,"i rented this movie because i love julia stiles and it looked like a cute, fun romantic comedy. i was wrong. it started out all right, for maybe the first five minuets. then the jokes went out of hand; dragging on and on and making you embarassed for the characters.it wasnt just that it was predictable, a lot of movies are and are still good, but something was lacking. there wasnt enough build up between julia and jason. i found myself wondering why they fell for each other. and it was really hard to believe that selma wouldnt have found out about everything that was going on for such a long time. mainly the characters weren't developed and i found myself not really caring about the outcome.i wouldnt recommend this, instead watch some other of julia stile's movie such as ten things i hate about you or save the last dance; both of which i loved."
5,Underrated but Frickin Hilarious,"This is one of those movies that critics hate, but anyone who knows of the genious of Jason Lee will know that anything he touches turns into hilarious gold, even if it's supposed to be a romantic comedy. This easily one of the funniest and most quotable movies I have ever seen."
4,Great book,My daugther LOVES this book! I bought it for her first birthday and she wants to read it again and again. She loves lifting the flap on each page. My only complaint is that I wish the flaps were a little more durable.
1,Bland,"Being an avid Spot fan for many years now I was eager to get my hands on Where's spot.Unlike its predecessors I was bitterly dissapointed.The plots were too simplistic, the characters as believable as England winning the Word cup this year.The one thing that really made me cringe was the author's literary zest...or lack therof. It was as though this novel was written for children.I found this book to be predictable, boring and condescending.*sigh*"
5,My 2 year old really enjoys this book,"We've had this book for almost a year, but my son still likes to read it. If your child likes to lift flaps they will enjoy this book. It's cute and fun."
2,Kinda cute...,"I like the Spot books and the Spot dog, but some of the varmints hiding under the flaps in this book are pretty evil-looking. They could have been cuter, making board-book-age kids more likely to want to repeat-read this book. The meanie illustrations keep this book on the bottom of the pile."
4,Nice little book,"It an nice interactive book. My daughter got a Spot book for gift and loved it, so I wanted to try other from the series. I was disappointed with the size, since the other book was bigger."
5,Our favorite book!,"This has been a favorite book of all 3 of our kids. Throughout the book we are searching for Spot in different spaces in the house (Is Spot under the bed?? <lift the flap> No. <there is an alligator there>) My kids have learned several animal noises and the word, ""no"" from the simple, sweet plot. Highly recommend for babies and toddlers."
1,not what i bought,"the cover is different, the book i received is paperback and the one i bought was described as a chunky hardback board book, aslo it took one month to receive the book, rediculous"
3,Great book but not for little hands !!,"I carefully read other parent's reviews regarding ""Where's Spot?"" before purchasing for my 18 month old girl and was happy and convinced that she would love it, for it clearly stated that the sturdy flaps were perfect for toddler hands.....Unfortunately, no.My daughter recceived the book and plush figure and was happily ""reading"" her book when I noticed that the falps she had to lift to find Spot, wer very thin cardboard and she wrinkled them and made marks on them every time she lifted them. When se reached the final flap and found Spot, she was so happy she tore the flap and looked very surprised not at Spot but at me as she handed me the piece !! I have now glued the flap two times and two more she has un-glued it, so now Spot doesn't hide anymore on the last page and the flap is under keepsake inside a bedside drawer.....A bit sad for my girl loved books and is very fond of Spot."
3,NOT ME,IT DIDN'T KEEP ME INTERESTED TO MUCH. IT WAS NOT REAL BAD. JUST NOT ME. YOU DON'T NOW IF IT IS YOU. UNTIL YOU TRY.
3,Cesare,"For anyone interested in the Borgia household and the Renaissance, this is a documentary for you. Very informative and from my own research, correct in most of their facts. There are a few very obvious mistakes, but overall a great movie"
2,Ready Wikipedia instead,"I couldn't help but feel that the 'tone' manipulated the audience by making statements that were never backed up by facts. Surely the history of the Borgia family is one that is filled with murder, corruption, intrigue and I suppose incest but the information is presented to make its audience shake its head on how could a pope and his cardinal son ever have gotten away with such things. Trouble is many popes and cardinals had mistresses and children out of wedlock and have themselves manipulated people to have a favorable outcome in their ambitious climb to the top. True while this isn't the same thing as murder and incest - I feel that this was laid on rather heavily to titilate the viewer. Go to wikipedia instead."
3,some great features...one big flaw for me,"I had a perfectly well working Siemens phone system with several handsets. I guess the batteries wore out over the 4 years that we had the phones and during a black out the system died on us. The Panasonic has made for a decent replacement but not perfect. (They no longer make the Siemens phone system in the US).I live in a ranch and the phone just gets fuzzy or disconnects when I walk in and out of certain rooms. However, the phone works many places in my yard and I have a big yard. I have moved the base phone, reset the handset signal to the base, etc. with no improvement. The help desk was not of much help.I do like the talking caller ID, the different ring sets, and the answering system. I do wish that when messages were left it would not be blasted out to the room. Overall if the phone didn't limit what rooms I could talk into then I would say this phone was perfect. And my wireless router for my computer seems to be working better too!"
2,VERY SHORT RANGE ON KX-TG5500 SERIES PHONES,"I purchased the Panasonic KX-TG5571M to replace a 8 year old Sony 900MHZ phone. The Sony would allow me to go about 400 feet from the base before the signal became unusable. The new Panasonic has a usable range on the order of 60 feet. I have a one story, 20 year old, 3000 Sq. Ft, brick home. Relocating the phone did not help.I returned the phone for credit and bought a Panasonic KX-TG5583, which is the same phone but with three color handsets, thinking the first unit may have been bad. NOT THE CASE. The replacement is just as poor in range.All the other features of the phone are good and work as advertised.If range is a concern for you, you would do well to look at some other system."
5,Excellent phone,"Great little phone system. I replaced a Siemens 8825 system, and have the base plus 6 remotes all over the house. Flawless in reception. I'm told the audio level output (talking) is a wee bit low though. One interesting ""con"" that I found was if the battery was fully charged and had stopped charging, then the battery was removed from the phone for more than a few seconds, it ""forgot"" that it was charged and decided to go charging for another 6 hours... not exactly a smart charger, and certainly not good for the battery! Love the huge display for an old blind guy like me :-)"
5,Best Cordless Phone We've Owned,"Pros: Great clarity, caller ID works well, works well at a good distance.Cons: Vocal caller ID doesn't seem to pronounce too well."
2,NO FLASH BUTTON ON HANDSET!,"I bought the KX-TG5571 and an extra handset after being so pleased with it'spredecessor KX-TG5471.The 5571 handset does not have a FLASH BUTTON!What you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button, wait foroptions to appear on the screen and then press a different button toaccess the FLASH function and there is NO WAY to figure that out whilelooking at the handset.WHY?"
2,telephone,I understood this phone was a 'rebuilt' and accepted it as I felt it would be 'better than new'. Was not. Messages coming in were either garbled or fading in-and-out. Both extremely annoying and unacceptable. Not a happy camper.
1,"The box say FHSS, *not* DSS.","Deceptive advertising. It should sayFHSS. If you want DSSS, don't get this."
1,Item Not As described,"Seller advertised as new, it was obviously used, missing the wrapper and the disk that was supposed to accompany it."
5,Great book for teachers and casual readers,"This is a wonderful book for educators, especially English teachers and those teaching either an Ethnic Lit course or a course specific to Asian American Lit. It provides a uniques historical perspective on the Japanese internment that is rarely seen in other books about the internment - the voices of young people contrasted with those same older voices. The research and dedication the author spent on this work shows not only in the quality of the book but also the depth of the scholarship. A wonderful resource book for teachers as well as a fine primary text for a high school or college class."
4,Pink guitar rocks,"I bought this for my wife as she wanted to pretend to be a rock star and wanted a pink guitar. For what I paid it met our needs. You get what you pay for but that is not a bad thing. Its a cheap guitar and amp it sounds like a guitar and it sounds like a cheaper amp. If you are looking for a serious set up spend serious bucks. Its a great starter guitar especially if somebody is feeling it out and may not stick with it.Pros: Looks nice, lighter than a real fender (much lighter than I thought). Amp is okCons: None if you realize what you are buying and what level it is for"
1,Never Again!! Buyers Beware!!,"I will never buy anything that comes from austin bizaar again! It is a defect,the strap broke the first time she tried to play it,itcame down on her arm and hurt it.It did not have the cable for the amp.They said to let them know and they would send it.That was a lie.I was in a car accident and that was all the money I had for christmas.I can not afford to send it back! I just learned never to buy from them again. Also the guitar was not packaged good at all. I ordered 3 guitars pink,blue,and black.they where all suppose to austin bizaars.When the black and blue came they where a different kind then austin bazaar they where Glen Burton guitars wich are way better then austin bizaars.Out of the 3 amps they sent 2 of them have a hum.I learned a valuable lesson and I hope this will help other people as well.Good Luck and becareful who you buy from!Angela"
4,"A somewhat dated,though timeless comming of age guide to sex","I first read this book in the fall of 1973 as a junior in high school. A rather ignorant and scared one. The title held my hand at one of the most difficult times in a soon to be young man's life.It is a combination of tutor, mentor, MD, Father, older Brother, coach, and Hugh Hefner. Not quite the ""Kama Sutra"" but more than ""Penthouse Letters"", ""The Sensuous Man"" lays out the truths and myths of male-female contact sports. It is factual, confidence building, humorous, broad and this is notable...... highly ethical.I recomend the ""The Sensuous Man"" for driving age boys through college age men, and for other men without the time required for say ""Joy of Sex"" or like manuals. I am purchasing a copy to place in my library for the day my son comes of age and indeed for my own continuing education and amusment!"
3,typical,"Mystery Date is no mystery what the storyline is about. A young college kid hopes to score with the girl next door. With help from a buddy... will it happen? You'll have to watch it and see.It's not a particularly interesting storyline or a revolutionary concept by any means, but it's a story that flows in a relatively enjoyable way, and has some decent moments from time to time.The acting skills aren't that great though. Regardless, it's a passable film that hasn't dated as horribly as some other films released 20 years ago."
5,I recommend this to Lovers.,I rated this movie when I was back in college and it is a funny somewhat dark comedy about two strangers on a chaotic first date. A very good buy.
3,3 1/2 for a quality film,"So, what is this mystery date? Well, I reckon it's a bit like 2010's 'Date Night' myself - ordinary, quiet people get caught up in a wild, dangerous web of crime and adventure.The plot is really interesting but what really makes this movie is the strength of the two main characters - Teri Polo is so cute as the girl-next door, Geena, who, despite being really hot, is smitten with the nerdy Tom, who stutters and stammers and keeps appollogising, clearly deep in love and is just like any nervous kid on a first date.Throw in the mix Fisher Stevens as the hilarious 'Dwight' character, an in competent, goofy flower delivery guy, who can't die no matter what, and a series of twists and turns invovling gangsters and Chinese proverbs, and you're on a winner.'Mystery Date' is a hot love story, a feeling enhanced by a great soundtrack, a seat-of-your-pants thriller and a comedy. Recommended viewing, seven out of ten."
2,Same fruit every month for three months,"I ordered this for my parents and each month they received oranges. Three months worth of nothing but oranges (yes there were sometimes different varieties, but REALLY?!?!), and for this amount of money! Not a nice gift at all. Nothing interesting, nothing exotic, just oranges. Very disappointing and embarrassing to be the giver of this gift."
1,Horrible!,"I pre ordered this Months ago before it was even available and waited patiently for it to be ready to be shipped.It sounded great and I couldnt wait to use it. Lets just say that it is now being used as a coaster. I could not get it to do anything that it was supposed to do .I thought it was just Me who was having trouble with it and I happened to look back here to look at the reviews,and see that everyone is having the saMe trouble with it. It is definitely not worth buying. Big waste of Money! I wont be preordering anything like this again. I will wait and read the reviews."
1,"Awful software, even the latest version","Terrible software, hard to use, useless. I asked for my money back the next day and they refused. I wish I had read the reviews here first!"
1,Very Bad,This is not user-friendly at all & provides very little help with starting up. I cannot quickly construct an image to even serve as a base for the design. I am going to try to return this item & try something else...I doubt they will let me return it though.
3,"Great in options, but wished it had more heads","We loved the flexible piece, but the downer was that it could have done with more heads so we can use more different screw heads. The heads provides limited the full potential of this set."
5,TV the way it ought to be!,"My wife and I have seen every episode of the British series ""Life on Mars."" It is an example of what TV could be if quality was first and foremost in the minds of those who created it. This is really one of the best and most entertaining series ever done for television. There were one or two episodes we weren't that into, but overall, it's wonderful entertainment. I recommend it without reservation."
2,Who knew stock brokers were so dramatic?,"This is the funniest horror movie I've ever seen. Were they really werewolves? They seemed more like cannibals. But did they actually eat their prey? Every time a little actual HORROR began the scenes ended. And I'm not really sure why two guys would gang up on one girl, strip down to their matching underwear, begin a threesome, and then eat her. Why not save time and eat her with their clothes still on? The best part was when all the wolves were killed with a single ball point pen. Oh Lord how I laughed. The acting was bad and the direction was horrible. They used the same shots over and over again and it got really boring. If this movie wasn't so corny I wouldn't have skimmed through to the end. I have seen worse movies though. I give it two stars because it made me laugh."
2,This movie had one good concept,"I liked the concept about a pack of wolves being money hungry on Wall Street.that's about where my enjoyment for this movie begins and ends.Other than that, there were no real werewolves in this film. The acting was bad enough. Eric Roberts didn't do too bad, but that's about it. The plot could have been better and it had a stupid ending... really stupid ending.And the homoerotica was just lame. I've seen just about all of David Decoteau's films and in all honesty, I'm never expecting much, except a bunch of pretty boys prancing around in their undies. But I will say this, if you're going to continue to make movies with homoerotic undertones, then be bold for once and actually have gay characters in your movies! Show a man/man kiss for a change."
2,deacon review,"Not impressed, disappointed, definitely not worth seeing of a movie to put you to sleep. Not action packed, gory either"
1,"not much use for homeschool teachers, IMO","This book is very much geared toward teachers teaching in schools, lots of info on phonics theory and assessment, very little on implementation and methodology. This is most definitely not a how-to book."
2,Giorgio shower gel,Used to use this 20 - 25 yrs ago when the store Giorgio was open in Beverly Hills. Product must be made elsewhere or by a different formula now - -- as it just is not the same - - does not have the same scent as it used to. Sorry.
5,What a great album!!!!,"Frampton only made two full length albums for Atlantic Records. While both are awesome albums, this one is the best of the two. It's hard to find on CD! But it appears to be easy to find on vinyl. Best song on this album is the ballad ""All Eyes On You"". Such a beautiful song."
2,DIDN'T AGE WELL,"WHEN I ORDERED THIS CD, I DID NOT RECALL SEEING THE NOTE THAT THIS IS A CD-R MANUFACTURED ON DEMAND. WHEN I RECEIVED IT, I NOTICED THE PACKAGING LOOKED OFF WITH NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE RELEASE. WHEN I PLAYED IT, I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS OFF. THIS WAS APPARENTLY A CD-R MADE FROM THE COMPRESSED MP3 FILES WHICH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FROM AMAZON. I AM NOT A FAN OF DIGITAL DOWNLOADS. I FIND COMPRESSED MUSIC FILES TO BE TOO SHRILL AND LACKING IN WARMTH. IN SHORT, THE SOUND OF THIS RELEASE STINKS. REGARDING THE MUSIC ITSELF, I AM SURPRISED BY HOW MUCH I FOUND MYSELF CRINGING WHEN I LISTEN TO IT. I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF 80'S MUSIC IN GENERAL AND HADN'T REALIZED HOW STEEPED IN THAT SOUND THIS ALBUM WAS UNTIL I LISTENED TO IT RECENTLY AFTER MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SINCE ITS ORIGINAL RELEASE. IT HAS NOT AGED WELL. NO WONDER WHY IT IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAIL IN THE CD-R FORMAT. I DO NOT WRITE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OFTEN, BUT THIS RELEASE HAS EARNED ONE. SORRY MSR. FRAMPTON"
5,Panasonic KX-TGA550M Accessory Handset is great!,"The Panasonic KX-TGA550M Accessory Handset is easy to use and has features lacking in our other extension phones that cause us to migrate past the others and use the accessory handset. We especially like the speaker phone capability. I can turn on the speaker, put the phone down, and have a conversation while working in the kitchen, working on my computer, etc. It is a convenience that the accessory handsets require only an electric outlet for the charging cradle and not a phone jack which allows significantly more flexibility in where we put it. We will likely pick-up additional handsets and replace other extension phones with this model that we prefer."
4,Panasonic Remote Phone,The product was a refurbished unit completed by Panasonic. I have found no trouble with it.
5,Exactly what you would expect,These stickers are exactly what you would expect - big stickers to put on your boxes in hopes that whose ever carrying it will try to not drop or play soccer with your box. Worked great and nothing got broke during our move.
4,Great story. Lots of editing errors,I enjoyed this novel quite a bit. The only reason I didn't give five stars is the editing mistakes. there are even a few places when they use Jaylynns name instead of dez when jaylynn is not in the scene..
5,Cahokia: City of the Sun,"This book is an excellent introduction to the history and archaeology of the Cahokia acropolis. Compact and readable, and accessible to both young and old, Cahokia: City of the Sun is the perfect book for those interested in getting started in the study of Cahokia, or for those who just want to know a little more about the ancient history of the American Midwest."
4,Wind in the Willows,"I had ordered several Wind in the Willow DVDs. This was not a British production or the Disney production. It was a good representation of the classic. I did give this to some children to introduce them to the story. It is a good DVD, just not up to the others I have seen."
2,Don't Bother,"I enjoy Carrey and Leoni but this movie was a waste of time. I love movies and pretty much enjoy anything that passes the ""watch test."" Here, I looked at my watch at least 4 times and really was so uninvolved that I was happy when it ended. Look, I even liked Cable Guy ok, but this was terrible."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a while,"The funniest part of the first hour, which is all I saw before shutting this dreadful movie off, had nothing to do with the plot; it had to do with a dog getting shocked hard with an electric collar. I wanted to laugh. I really did. I tried hard. But I couldn't get into this movie at all for a variety of reasons.1. For a comedy, it wasn't funny.2. The plot was idiotic and the ""story"" took too long to begin.3. It was trying to make a point about corporate corruption, but there was no way I could sympathize with the two main characters. Jim Carrey's character was a snob. I wanted to shout ""TEMP JOB"" at Tea Leoni.For that triumverate of reasons, I couldn't recommend a movie less than this one. Don't see it. If you have a copy, burn it in the winter."
4,"Not superb, but a great comedy!","When I saw the trailer for this I thought it looked great so I saw it for my birthday and I thought it was really funny. It wasn't great but it was hilarious and worth it for the laughs. If you're looking for a comedy to buy or rent get this one it's not a waste of time. I thought Jim Carrey did one of the best jobs of his career but that my sound ridiculous. He was definitely better in this than in Bruce Almighty. Very funny but don't buy it, rent it first."
2,Fun With Dick and Jane I Think Not,This movie was an hour half-hour of boredom. Not only was it not funny but plot was as ridiculous as it could be. Jim Carrey antics couldn't make this movie any better. Despite the fact I hope it would. Tea Leoni was great as Jane who really was the save of this movie. Which is a sad testimony indeed! And if you thought the movie was bad the DVD extras really stink. For a great Dick and Jane get the original.
3,Fun With Dick and Jane,"Dick Harper (Carrey) has just been named VP of Communications at a corporation that is about to go under. [...] Dick has gone from being on top of the world to being jobless. Jane (Leoni) has quit her job after learning Dick had received a promotion, and now the two are unemployed.Unable to find jobs, the two begin selling off their posessions in order to retain their house. Eventually, when the bank comes for the house, they are forced to take matters into their own hands, becoming criminals and stealing to get by.""Fun With Dick and Jane"" is a disappointment. It is not very funny. Jim Carrey gives his usual over-the-top performance, but that act is going old. Téa Leoni is unremarkable as Jane and adds little to the film. While being far from awful, ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" is not a movie that I can recommend."
3,"They really messed up, could have been hilarious.","I think the movie should have been about each of their robberies and a new zany costume each time and how it played out. That would have been funny, not some sappy story with a few chuckles in it........ Also, I didn't understand the ending at all and it was not explained."
1,I wanted my money back,"Very little funny about this movie. It was just depressing for the most part with the main characters going into financial ruin. Watch it on cable if you must, but only if you really do not value your time either"
5,Comedy with a message...,"I loved this movie. It was hilarious, but it had a message against the corrupt Enrons and corporations of our day. It was thoroughly modern, and very entertaining."
1,Jim Carey's career is over....,Worst movie I've seen in awhile. Not a funny moment throughout. A tired attempted retread of his older movies and his schtick flat - turned it off 3/4 the way thru. Watch Cable Guy or Liar Liar again instead........
1,Funny? Really?!!!,"I had a serious problem entertaining even the possibility of traces of humor in many scenes of this movie. Is is sad, shameful, and depressing! OK Carrey is unpredictable from 0 to 10 so no surprise there... but Téa Leoni for crying out loud?! What a waste!"
1,See Dick and Jane make a bomb of a movie!,"Like the previous movie of the same name, it should have concentrated more on how to get even with the corporate thieves and not the convenience stores! The idea was there, the execution was horrible! The usually reliable Jim Carrey was completely off his gameplan. The laughs were non existent and the storyline was a struggle. The fault all goes to the people who put together the story. This film was just brutal to watch! Don't waste your time!"
3,Fun with Dick and Jane,"Movie was ok. I would not rate this among his classics like Ace Ventura or Me, Myself, and Irene. My girlfriend really likes it so we now own it."
5,Hilarious,"This is a really fun, fun , fun movie. Great to watch as a couple! Classic ""guy that gets jerked around ends up winning in the end"" feel good flick. I like how it shows a traditional, very loving and supportive relationship between the title couple, even when times get rough."
3,Better than expected,"Carey (Dick) is going about 4/5's the speed that he does in Mask or Ace Ventura -- not quite as manic, and I think that this actually makes him more attractive, though less ""funny"" if you know what I mean.Tea Leoni(Jane) is lovely, able to shift comedic gears in a nano-second.The idea of a criminal company leading to the criminal behavior of its former employees is a great premise, but it feels like the scriptwriters didn't realize the full potential of what they had. Also, the ending is enjoyable, but you kind of finish the movie saying ""that's it?""That being said, you'll like bits like the ""interview"" that Dick has, you'll enjoy the couple's descent into the life of crime, and you'll enjoy the crime spree.This is a funny entertainment with some good bits and two excellent leading actors. Enjoy it for what it is."
1,Really depressing,"I'm so glad I didn't pay any money to watch this movie, because that would have made it even more depressing. It's just a sad take on white collar crimes and corporate scandals and not the type of Jim Carrey movie I'd like to see. He should stick to fart jokes.His attempts at comedy in this movie were boring and unfunny."
3,"""Fun with Jim and Tea/ Fun with Sonny and Cher.""","Who would've imagined Jim Carrey impersonating Cher in this goofy comedy remake? It's a mediocre comedy compared to what Carrey's already done in the past. It's not very funny, because the jokes are weak, and the script is boring. Despite having a strong leading performances from Tea and Jim, it's still not enough to generate enough fun. Also, the supporting players including Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins, and Richard Burgis are just so wasted in low-key roles. Is Baldwin really that desperate for work that he had to play an unsophisticated villian in a Jim Carrey flick? I hope Carrey's next film will either be something more original than The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or a comedy more outrageous than Me, Myself, and Irene. As for Tea Leoni, she was far more entertaining in Spanglish last year."
1,Jim Carey has left the building...,"All comedians (think Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy) seem to have their time in the sun, and then, their schtick gets old and their comedy becomes rather sad and pathetic.Ten years from now it will be clear that this movie is where Jim Carey's comedy jumped the shark.My advice: Don't even rent this. Even if you manage to sit through the whole movie, it'll just be two hours of your life that you'll never get back."
3,Better then I expected,I don't like Jim Carrey much so when I watched this movie I was not expecting much. Probably a good thing.This film is actually one of Jim Carrey better movies.The story itself was quite unrealistic often. Definitely overdone in parts. Anyone with any experience in business that the story does not make much sense. Still the acting was quite good. He was often quite funny. Many of the scenes were funny. The ending was stupid though.Its okay for a laugh.
1,Total waste of anyone's time. . .,One of the most un-funniest movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. I have no idea what the studio must have been thinking when they saw the finished version of this disaster of a movie. This doesn't even deserve a direct to video release. What a total waste of time and lots of money.
2,Dull,"Wow, Jim Carrey, I thought for a while you were back to your normal crazy comidic self, but I was wrong. This movie came across as a Truman Show type comedy, it wasn't too funny. Don't get me wrong, I liked Truman Show, but they marketed this movie totally wrong. It was misleading, showing people all the funny parts in the trailer, so people thought it as a funny slapsticky type comedy. My advice, see a worthwhile comedy, or go for dinner instead."
1,Not Like the Book,"I'm sorry but I didn't like this movie. When you make a major literary adaptation, you should at least have all the major characters in it. And this movie forgot the two best characters, Sally and Spot. Where is Spot? Did he run away? Run, Spot, Run!But maybe he ran too far and is gone? This breaks my heart because I loved Spot and he was my friend! And what about Sally? She was always with the mischief, and squirting the hose, and getting Dick and Jane all wet! But she is not here and how can that be? It is like having Gone with the Wind and no Scarlett O'Hara!So, I'm sorry. This is no stars because the two best stars are gone. But I give it one star. But that star is not Dick. That star is not Jane. That star is for my Spot and my Sally. And it shines brightly for them, as if the star is a candle and it is flickering in the night, and it is wondering if they are okay..."
4,Worth Seeing,"This is not a classic and it is not realistic, but it is fun and there are parts that are great. I love Leoni and Carey together. The best is when he loses his job, he tries to turn to stealing as a means to pay for his bills. It it what it is - a great way to spend and hour and 1/2."
2,Predictably Dumb,"Carrey and Leoni play a married couple who have great jobs and plenty of money, until Dick receives a promotion and Jane quits her job, to stay home with her son who speaks with a Hispanic accent due to being around their maid/nanny all the time.Problem is, Dick's CEO (Alec Baldwin) is corrupt and sells out all the stock, leaving the entire company jobless, penniless and pension-less. Dick and Jane are reduced to selling househould items. Then they begin to steal from convenience stores and banks, traumatizing innocent employees to pay the mortgage on their $600,000 house. It's all about Dick and Jane's problems!Carrey, as usual, plays a monkey-faced buffoon, and Baldwin, as usual plays the sleazy villain. Does anyone else get tired of this?In the end, the dog is left out with no explanation. And they never pay back all the money they stole. The message is ""Get whatever you can take."""
1,Poor Script,"I thought this would be a good funny Jim Carrey movie. This was the worst I've seen! The plot was awful, it wasn't even funny- it was just a waste of time. If you're looking for a good Jim Carrey movie rent Liar, Liar or Bruce Almighty."
2,Do yourself a favor.... rent the original!,"George Segal and Jane Fonda they ain't.Carrey's always over-the-top stupidity leaves me cold! Tea Leone is cute, but rather flat in her affect.Segal & Fonda are a great comic duo; remember when we had those?While you're at it try the stars two other great comedies,The Owl and the Pussycat, and Cat Ballou.Those you won't regret spending time on. :)"
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","Fun with Dick and Jane met but did not beat my expectations based off the previews. It's about a higher middle-class family trying to succeed in the pre-Enron/Worldcom era. Dick (Carrey) receives what he thinks is going to be his big break in Golbodyne, only to become a scapegoat for the company as it tumbles all around him. His wife quits his job without knowing of Dick's unfortunate turn of events only to have all their possessions, including their lawn, reprocessed. To ensure their house doesn't get foreclosed, Dick and Jane do what any one of us would do... Start robbing people. This is when the story kind of lapses and the humor (?) begins.To Jim Carrey's credit, the humor in this is not over-the-top or gross out humor, which makes this film actually suitable for the whole family.To sum up, I wouldn't run to Blockbuster or make it my first pick on Netflix, but I would recommend it for anyone looking for a moderately fun film to kill some time."
5,Great Movie,This movie was a great hit in our household - love Jim Carey! This movie really can get you in a great mood!
4,Great date flick!!,HILARIOUS!!!! I am a huge fan of Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey so together they made for a great movie!!
4,Fun movie,"I hadn't seen Jim Carrey in a movie since Liar Liar. And while that was one of my favorites, Fun with Dick and Jane was enjoyable the whole way through. I give Jim the credit. I can't go with 5 stars, because I believe that the same movie without Jim Carrey, would have missed the mark a bit. Jim was in his customary rare form, so the result is that it was a good movie that did make me laugh more than once. I think you'll like it."
2,Tries too hard,"Fun with Dick & Jane is a so-so remake of the 70's original with George Segal and Jane Fonda. Updated in the era of Enron and high-tech electronics, it loses a lot of the innocent, free-spirited fun of the original. Carey, as usual, has some scenes that have no other purpose than to showcase his rubber-faced expressions and Leoni seems rather tired of the whole thing. I actually fell asleep two-thirds of the way through; for a comedy, that's not a good thing."
4,Such Fun...,"I had so much fun watching this film!It is truely hilarious and I laughed the whole time.Jim Carrey is a great, funny actor and he made this movie even better.Bottom line is, watch this movie.Tons of laughs. Garanteed."
2,"Absolutely love Carrey, but this movie was pretty bad","I was excited because this was a Jim Carrey flick, but that's about the only exciting thing about this movie. It's most certainly Carrey's worst film to date. It was like one of those bad ""In Living Color"" skits that just didn't work. This movie didn't work. Don't get me wrong. It's not a complete abomination. There are definitely some semi-funny moments. But the movie as a whole was completely non-realistic, not overly funny, and just kept me reaching for something to grab onto.I suppose a massive Carrey fan would want to see this movie, but any casual movie fan who isn't huge on Carrey doesn't need to bother seeing this. Thank GOODNESS I didn't buy the DVD on sale for $9.99, and rented it for $5 instead!"
2,Don't see Dick and Jane!,"Fun With Dick And Jane is a classic 70's comedy starring George Segal and Jane Fonda. Why did they have to remake it at all?The new version stars Jim Carrey as Dick and Tea Leoni as Jane. There are many similarities between the two versions but with different plot twists and situations. Instead of Dick getting fired from his top paying job, here he is laid off when his company falls broke. The ending also changes, the original had an excellent heist conclusion, here the ending bares no power at all and is comparably weak.Another big difference is that the original had many laughs, smart ones that is. The new version contains silly jokes, dull that is.My expectations of the movie were pretty high walking in, but I must say that since the original is one of my favorite comedies, I was disappointed with the outcome. Jim Carrey better follow this one up with an original comedy.Not really recommendedC-"
3,Being Nice To Give It 3 Stars,"I have to say that I am disappointed with the movie. I have been a fan of Jim Carrey since the beginnings of his rise to fame in the movie business, and I have to say, that this is just boring. Fun with Dick and Jane is a movie that has shown almost all of the funny scenes on the commericals, but there were a few other times that made me laugh. For the rest of the movie, it was actually kind of dull. It did have it's laughs here and there, but overall it was dull. Once again, speaking as a Jim Carrey fan, it doesn't measure up."
2,Bored with Dick and Jane,I don't know anything about the original. I just know that this movie failed to amuse me. Carey being Carey and Baldwin being Baldwin. And Leoni just plain ole annoys me. The whole third act makes no sense to me and seemed to be made up each day they came to work. By the time Baldwin makes this huge transfer-I'm thinking this man would have done all of this months ago. The switch of the transfer papers-all of that was just ridiculous-Were the Hollywood writers on strike again when this movie was made?
3,A fun movie for a rainy day,"Good fun movie for a rainy day. Definitely some comic genius in it, with some mixed undertones. Definintely has some dry moments. I think people can relate to this movie since our society seems to live this way. Except...let's hope we don't all turn into criminals when the bill collectors come knocking. Love the dedications at the end!!!!"
2,just watch the commercials,I couldn't wait to see this on dvd....it looked so funny on the commercials... well don't bother -- because all the funny parts are in the commercials.
1,Very disappointed with this product,I followed the instructions on the package but the bag burst in the microwave after the first 4-5 uses! I threw it away and did not try to return it because it would not have been worth the effort.
3,Simply Cozy,"While the pad heats up nicely, it's a bit too brittle...and kinda crinkly loud. Our original pads were more comfy. Plus, a couple of the bags had holes in them when they arrived...they were folded in half during shipping and crinked."
1,wrong product and no refund,"The item I ordered (heat pad) was not shipped. Instead, I received a bottle of melatonin, which I promptly returned. After 4 weeks I still had not received a refund. I regard the supplier of this item to be highly unreliable based on this experience. Amazon has agreed to refund the amount charged to my credit card."
5,Shuggie Otis Kicks [...] and Takes Names,"Great blend of R&B with Rock and even some spices of hip-hop, but overall just a very ORIGINAL sound with great vocals. Personally I'm more from the family of rock 'n roll and not R&B but still the album shines to me. Trust me before you go and buy whatever new album is rising on the Billboard charts pick up this baby first."
4,Astounding Tracks,"These songs have some of the most elegant construction. The horn arrangements are deft, and Otis' guitar and bass playing is superb. Sure, some of the songs do sound kind of dated; some of the drum machine work seems cheezy. But put him in his time, and realize that he was using these sounds creatively and inventively. A great musician who approached music with intellegence and awareness."
2,Only Fair,"Concepts are there, songwriting is not. The guy's got his groove going, but that's about it. Too bad he had only one or two goods songs in him, Strawberry Letter 23 among them. I understand that after this album he returned to undistinguished blues noodling, which is what he apparently still does today. Some hidden nuggets deserve obscurity!"
2,Sub-Sly Pseudo Psychedelic Soul,"Paul Weller was recently quoted in Mojo magazine claiming that Sly Stone's ""Runnin' Away"" reminded him of Shuggie Otis. Next, he'll claim Kashmir is reminiscent of early Detective! Granted, this is a buried treasure of sorts, but for every studio musician who ever wanted to star on their very own album, thankfully very few ever get the privilege. If you like sanitized post-Sly funk grooves sung by a guy who sounds strangely similar to Christopher Cross (yes, of ""Sailing"" fame), this one's for you. Every dog may have has day eventually, but I ain't buyin'."
2,hear it first,"Very disappointed with this release. Half the album sound like bad ""light jazz"", bad Stevie Wonder, bad whatever. Very boring and dated. Listen before you buy."
2,We won't get fooled again?,"Plucked from obscurity, it's a one band band that combines all the greatness of Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, and The Pope, I'm sure. I can't imagine why such an extraordinary talent went unnoticed for so long. It certainly sounds romantic, and if it empowers you as a music listener to feel that you've discovered something that the majors couldn't swallow because they're just not with it, then my friend, consider yourself with it. Stick it to those fat cats! You're in the company of every hip happening musician from Stereolab to The High Llamas. Is this CD any good? Heavens, no. Pedestrian at best. But let not this petty reality stand in the way of a great legend like Shuggie Otis. A career retrospective is certainly in order. I'll file it near my Bohannon and Con Funk Shun box sets. Shuggie's CD will look great in your CD collection. Let 'em know you've been reading Spin."
3,Over-hyped and overrated,"I don't get what's supposed to be so mind-blowing about this CD - and I'm not one who ""just doesn't like this kind of music"". Most of the songs don't have much substance at all. The best by far are the title track, which is pretty nice, and the bonus cuts from the 'Freedom Flight' LP. If it weren't for those, I'd give the CD 2 stars."
2,Very Jammy,"Strawberry Letter 23 was completed by the Brothers Johnson on their marvelous hit version. Shuggis Otis' original sounds a bit like a demo. Out of all the cuts on this CD, the one song that I think is brilliant and stands out over the rest is, Aht Uh Mi Hed. It sounds like a lost soul classic. If you like jam sessions, this may be the CD for you. But if you want polished songs this much heralded recording may just be too jammy and free form."
4,Nothin' but Tha Funk,"Whoa.I'd never heard of Shuggie Otis until I read a review of the re-release of ""Inspiration Information"" in Rolling Stone. But boy, am I glad I did. Otis' funk-rock excursions combine the best of Jimi Hendrix with the best of Marvin Gaye for one tight LP.A light vibe is maintained throughout most of the album, witnessed on the breezy title track, the bouncy ""Happy House,"" and the slide-guitar-assisted ""Sweet Thang,"" whose groove can't help but make you nod.But the mellow moments here really round the album out. ""Aht Uh Mi Hed"" has a steady backbeat and a dramatic instrumental break complete with string flourishes and orchestral backing. The most popular song from the album, ""Strawberry Letter 23"" uses acoustic guitar and bells to set the mood, and the closer, ""Freedom Flight,"" is the most Hendrix-inspired of the bunch, as Otis' guitar wraps itself around a building rhythm.""Inspiration Information"" is a near-perfect summer album to just throw on and kick back to."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this CD because of the hype I was reading about it. Basically this is a reissue of some of Shuggie's real old stuff. There are some good nastalgic songs on here, like ""Aht Uh M Hed"" and ""Strawberry Letter,"" but I can't say I was so moved by the rest of the CD. It sounds like old, groovy R&B toons from the 70s with that sort of scratchy background that tells you this was originally an analog recording. If you're into 70s toons, then go for it."
4,A handful of gems,"A handful of songs on the album are true gems. But I don't think the entire album stands out as a classic. Still, I bought the CD once... then lost it... now I'm buying it again. That probably speaks louder than words."
3,unrealistic plot,"This episode has some illogical aspects. Once you view it ask yourself about the legal aspects of abandoned property. If a family does not claim ownership of some property for 150 years and does not pay death duties on it as it passes between generations of the family, do they have a legal claim on the property?This is just as preposterous as if the Oxford CID used Ouija boards for solving crimes or used beatings with rubber hoses to ""interview"" suspects."
5,Sins of the Fathers,"This DVD is a gift for my husband as it is one of his favorite episodes in the series. Since it takes place involving an English brewing family; and I have family in England, the story is appealing to my husband who brews and loves a good beer. It is highly entertaining and highly recommended."
5,Awsome Video,"Great video! You should own it today, and share the Monkees with you're family, if you love them as much as I do, you will enjoy this video."
2,Disappointing yo-ho,"Not the best selection of pirate movies here - the cover definitely works better than the content. And 'The Son of Monte Cristo' is a most definitely land-locked tale... Still, fun rainy day watching."
4,Another Good Effort,I am not sure why this author does not get more buzz in the Florida contingent of mystery writers - I find his stories very entertaining and always look forward to the next Alex Rutledgemystery. This one is another interesting story - and it disappopints me that Corcoran gets no press. I checked out of curiosity and saw that the Borders near my house did not carry this book nor did any Borders in St. Louis - you could order it and get it in a week. Obviously the published is not doing much to promote - and I believe the release of this book was delayed for some time - not sure what is going on but I encourage the writer to keep up with this story line.
5,You'll love these books,This was my first Alex Rutledge mystery and I've gone on to buy the rest of Corcoran's catalog. These are great books -- some of the best and most nuanced mystery novels I've ever read.
4,Another Great One,I have read all of the Alex Rutledge series and if you love Key West these are the books for you. If you do not love Key West get ready to.
5,Timeless Classic on Ironclad Development,"This is a must-read for anyone interested in ironclad development. Well written and thorough, it provides a great foundational read for anyone interested in the field. Newer books cover specific ships or technologies in more detail and are frequently based on newly found archival information, but this book provides the sweep and scope they miss. It is not highly technical. Great history well written."
4,Good but not as good as Fuzzy Bee or Squishy Turtle,"This is another excellent cloth book for babies and toddlers but it doesn't have as many things to pull on or that stick out (which is what most babies enjoy the most) as some of the other cloth books like Fuzzy Bee and Friends or Squishy Turtle and Friends. My son also loves Fluffy Chick and Friends as well. If I had to rank the cloth books in order they would be: 1) Fuzzy Bee, 2) Squishy Turtle, 3) Fluffy Chic, 4) Big Rex, and 5) Snowy Bear. If you don't have the first four, I would get them first and get this book last when you are bored of the others. It is still a good book, just not as good as the others."
4,squishy turtle is better,"My 3 month old is loving the Priddy books. Squishy turtle is brighter and seems to keep her attention better, but both are great."
2,Poor book,"Unlike the Fluffy Chick and Squishy Turtle books in the same collection, this book is made out a very light and cheap fabric. It definitely makes it less appealing. Also, the touch and feel things are mostly patches of different textures to touch only whereas the two other ones have also things to pull. The editor obviously saved money making a poorer book."
3,"Handy, but kind of out of place","This organizer will come in handy if you don't have to lug around a lot of supplies with you, but it tends to feel a bit heavy if you're going to carry it in a cargo pocket on your scrubs. It requires a 4 inch or so pocket to fit into. I prefer my tie around waist organizer, but this may work better for some nurses."
2,Seems nice but snap was broken,"School hasn't started so I haven't used this product yet, but right off when I opened the package there was a small problem. One of the snaps was broken on the little velco tabs. I am going to see if they will send me a replacement, but that was a disappointment. If they do I will amend my review."
3,Still memorable after nearly 20 years,"I was 7 or 8 when I read this book, and it's still the only Choose Your Own Adventure Book I remember. It was well written and had a fresh feel to it, unlike the innumerable other books in the Choose Your Own Adventure series. The twists and turns were exicting (when I was that young), and the endings offered up were sufficiently pleasing. If someone has never read one of these books, and is interested, I'd have to say that this is the one to read."
2,"Good idea, not very well executed","This book could have been alot better. The scenarios in which you are searching the ocean for the lost city are well detailed with a good sense of atmosphere, but when you do reach Atlantis (via that metal lid in the rocks), the story becomes so vague and sped up, it loses most of it's appeal. Some of the events loop into eachother and it's easy to face that attacking squid over and over again. There is not that much character development when it comes to the people of Atlantis. They are described as 'people who look just like you, only they wear greek clothing' and that's it. There is also an event in which you lead a revolt against the King of Atlantis in what seems like 2 sentences. This is not Montgomery's better books. I would say he fared alot better with 'Space and Beyond'. One of the very few things that are appealing about this book are the cool illustrations from Granger."
2,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Washington DC,"This is a nice compact guide with many great photos. It is organized quite nicely and is a great help in finding your way around Washington DC. Unfortunately, this book has not been updated since 9/11, and contains a great deal of out dated material. The book does have a sticker on it saying it is being continually updated, but the version currently being shipped is not up-to-date. When using this guide make sure you call ahead for visiting any government agency, building or office."
4,"Quirky, often dark tales","Smith's ""dating"" stories represent his effort to do a bit of an anthropological study of the human dating ritual, to shock and surprise the reader along the way, and to have some fun while doing it. Like all story collections, this one is a bit uneven, but at his best, Smith's smooth style, dry wit, and quirky observations about people make the book memorable. The story told by the psychiatrist, as well as the ""Fat Date"" story, can both be played for laughs, but both have a serious underpinning. All in all, quite enjoyable."
1,A Warning Label Should Be Attached,"I was one of the ""Ladies Number 1 Detective Agency"" fans who searched for 'more of the same' after reading, and throughly enjoying, all five books. The only positive thing I could say about these stories is that they were well written. However, the subject matter was totally surprising and repulsive to me. The characters in Heavenly Dates were NOT the wholesome, decent, honest, and likeable characters encountered in the Detective Agency books. Unfortunately, sleaze, seduction of teenage children, violence, and malice seem to be the norm in these stories. This volume is in the trash (I certainly could not recommend it to my friends!) and I will not purchase any more A.M.Smith books. I am very disappointed because I had been looking forward to Smith's next series."
3,It's Okay - Definitely not His Best,"There's an old rule of thumb in publishing: when an author becomes popular and well regarded, stories that might not have made it beforehand suddenly become ""good enough"" and are published.That's what we seem to have here. Some of the stories are good; all show touches of McCall Smith's writing talent; but none stand out.If this is your first glance at a McCall Smith title, look elsewhere - nearly everything else he's done shows much tighter prose, characters and stories. If you're a fan of McCall Smith, then this is probably worth getting ... or at least giving to another fan."
2,Despairing; unbalanced,"The Publishers' Weekly reviewer who wrote ""Smith's nine stories, with their light humor and touching moments, should inspire smiles and sighs in tenderhearted readers everywhere"" can't have read more than the first story, ""Wonderful Date,"" which really is tender and sweet. I found myself getting more and more depressed with each successive story. ""A Nice Little Date"" was absorbing but shocking; ""Bulawayo"" was relentlessly painful. The stories over all are well-written enough, but it isn't always clear what really happened or what the point is. ""Intimate Accounts,"" for example, I gather is really more about the psyche of the psychiatrist than of the three clients whose accounts he relates, but it isn't developed enough and I waited in vain for the payoff.The overall view of relations between the sexes, as well as the human psyche, is dark, despairing, disturbing, unbalanced. I don't recommend this collection."
3,A Darker Side,"These stories have a completely different flavor from the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. Fans of those books will find this one surprising and probably disturbing. The stories are not about happy endings, although one or two do end happily, but about consequences. When people act on impulse, or follow a course of action without understanding its implications, or simply give in to the darker side of their natures, things happen. The characters don't necessarily get what they deserve, they get much more, for better or worse."
1,Not Worthy of McCall-Smith,"""Nice Little Date"" - I'm disappointed by anyone who writes about a pedophile and his victim that does not expose pedophilia for what it truly is - an evil and vile addiction that brutally exploits the innocent child. Instead we have a story about a nervous Doctor who travels to a part of the city known for trafficking in little children and who ""hires"" a young girl for the night only to be disappointed to find out she is really a boy. Such mild irony is hardly worthy of the serious topic of pedophilia."
1,HORRIBLE change of pace from NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE series,"I was so pleased to find another book by Alexander McCall Smith. I adore the NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE books. Those stories are not only interesting , uplifting reads but are set in the wonderful world of Botswana, Southern Africa. I lived in Southern Africa for 2 years so I especially enjoyed his tales of life there and was pleased to see that Southern Africa was revisited in this collection. THAT is where the pleasure ended. Unsatisfying endings combined with the seeming glorification of adultery, prostitution, child exploitation, etc. made for a book SO unsavory that I could only make myself read about half of them before totally giving up in disgust.If you enjoy gentle, endearing stories that embrace the best in life, then this book is NOT for you! I will be reading McCall Smith's new series, THE ISABEL DALHOUSIE MYSTERY, with trepidation."
2,Hugely Disappointing,"Perhaps I was unfair to expect something as appealing as the ""Precious"" stories about the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, but I found little rhyme or reason to these tales. Even the weakly ironic twist at the end of the ""fatties"" dating story was cruel. If I could have found one that was at all uplifting, or even seemed to be written with a kindly-though-damning POV on the menacing labyrinth of courtship and marriage, or of the whole dating scenario, I would have deemed the book a good one; but after reading it through to the end, I wondered why I had bothered."
1,Waste of Time,"After falling in love with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, I have been wanting to read other books by AMS. The first chapter/story was so cute and I got really excited to continue reading. But after that, I was disappointed with the stories, plots, and themes. If you happen to pick up this book, just read the first chapter & ""Fat Date."" The rest is a waste of time."
1,Don't bother watching it,"First of, I completely agree with the other reviews for this movie.My five year old insisted on renting this movie, because he was hoping to see those ""scary sea creatures"". He was totally disappointed, as was I with the movie quality. Most computer-generated special effects were too much like a video game clips, Movie plot was silly. The worst thing was the sound quality. Music was way too loud comparing to the dialogs' sound. Actors mumbled a lot, when I tried turning the ""subtitles"" on to understand what they were saying, I found out that there was no option for it. Basically I missed half of the conversations."
1,Killer electric sea-ponies!,"This film promises you giant killer eels. What it gives you is a carbon copy of THE ABYSS. The eels get about two minutes of screentime and look like snakes with horse heads. That, and they never do anything cool.Bad acting and horrid effects ensue when an unknown heat source is detected below the Polar Ice Caps. Guess what the cause is: Super-intelligent electric eels with thoughts of world domination!Take my advice and only rent this movie to laugh at it with a group of freinds."
1,Definition of Sucks,"Deep shock is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Hardly ever do you actually 'WANT' to turn a movie off. This one made the list. Not worth renting! If you are considering buying this release for somebody, you are a bad person. If you happen to see it on cable, don't watch it, go out and enjoy the day. Avoid this movie at all costs."
2,DEEP DOO DOO,"Since when did eels have heads like dragons? Since when did David Keith resort to such mindless dribble to jump start his career? This can be answered in this laughably enjoyable ""thriller."" The plot focuses on age old eels who have come out of a trench in order to lay their eggs. Of course, the government once again wants to mess with nature. Seems these eels have hastened the global warming threat and unless they are destroyed, the earth will enter a new ice age in about fifty years. In comes the noble scientist who wants to examine them first. Of course, this is where the movie relies on its feeble plot, which is so muddled and meandering, the viewer can only ask who cares? Keith is wasted and the rest of the cast, especially villain Mark Sheppard, need to return to acting class. The special effects are amateurish and the whole movie seems long, even though it's relatively short.Rent it, but don't buy it; if you buy it, sell it on e-bay!"
2,Korean subtitled!,"Love Marilyn and was happy to get this movie collection - but not happy to learn - unfortunately after I had opened the package - that everything is subtitled in Korean. Pretty sure I would not have bought it had that been disclosed in the description. Seems like a fairly material thing to omit, but because they are DVDs there is a problem with returning them. Buyer beware. Shame on Amazon for an inaccurate description!"
2,Marilyn Monroe 10 disc Collection,"DO NOT BUY this Marilyn Monroe 10 disc Collection from 101 DISTRIBUTION unless you are crazy about huge, distracting Korean Subtitles. They have made it impossible to disable the subtitle feature, and, the large white text takes up a lot of the screen. If you thought the price was too good to be true, you'd be right. Too bad, because the quality of reproduction is really done well. Fix this problem, and you have a winner here."
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!,"I purchased this collection because I'm an old movie fan, and I have never before had any problems with Amazon. This collection has HUGE Korean subtitles on all of the DVD's that I could not turn off with either the disc menu or the subtitle button on my remote. I was so disappointed I sent it back, but because the package was opened Amazon only refunded half of the cost. So I ended up losing $20 on this collection all because AMAZON DID NOT MENTION THIS PRODUCT HAS KOREAN SUBTITLES in the description. Had they mentioned it, I definitely would not have purchased it. I'm so mad that they did not adequately describe their product and they won't even give a full refund. I'm going elsewhere for my DVD's from now on!"
1,Marilyn Monroe 10 Disc collection,"I would not recommend anyone to purchase this set of DVD's . If these are new and unused as described, I cannot understand the poor quality of this product. When I opened the wrapping and observed the discs, I found every disc was badly scratched. I have not tried all the discs, but I have doubts they will run without a problem. I would have returned them, however I read another customer comment that he only received half of his purchase price because the package was opened. I will probably not purchase any future DVD's from Amazon."
3,Marilyn in Korean,"Nowhere in the description of this product did it say that it was the Korean version of the box set. Luckily I can suppress the Korean subtitles. I still would have purchased the set because the price was very inviting, but it should have been noted that it's the Korean version."
4,Initial Opinion concerning subtitles,"I received this movie set as a Christmas present. My initial opinion about this product is that I think the packaging could have been better. I loved the fact that it had a place for each disc, and it wasn't bulky; but I was disappointed upon opening it that most of the discs were moving around because the little things that were suppose to keep them in place were broken. The dvds have scratches on them too. I wiped them, hoping they aren't damaged. I will check them out soon to make sure they play, and see if indeed you can turn off the korean subtitles. When I find these two things out, I will come back for another review. I had to continue my review here since they don't allow more than 1 review per product, per person. I watched one movie yesterday, I was able to turn off the subtitles and it played fine. So if they all play as good as the first one, I will be completely satisfied."
3,Vocies Matching The Picture,Is it just mine or does everyone else's voice's not match up with the picture? I dont know why but that drives me NUTS!
2,This DVD set is NOT a girl's best friend..,"I was very disappointed when this box set arrived. ALL of the center disc holders had broken, so all 10 discs were just rattling around loose in the box. Also, the entire box has a weird chemical smell, so I ended up taking out all the disc and throwing away the plastic disc package completely. I was aware that I would have to change the language from Korean to English when it arrived; no big deal. However, you still get subtitles in Korean no matter what (at least I can't figure out how to have no subtitles at all). These are adequate for now, but I can see I'll want to replace these discs sooner or later in a regular English, wide-screen version."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"NOT ONLY DID THIS ITEM SHIP DAMAGED, NOW I HAVE TO PAY TO SEND IT BACK! DESCRIPTION SAYS THE LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH- THE CASE IS PRINTED IN KOREAN! MAY SOUND LIKE A GREAT DEAL, IT IS NOT. IT TOOK 4 WEEKS TO RECEIVE ITEM. NOW IT IS ON BACKORDER AND WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT WAS IN STOCK AGAIN. I AM DEMANDING A REFUND!!!"
3,Indifferent,I have not watched these DVD's yet. I was disappointed to see the writing on the front was in a different language. I just hope that the movies are actually in english and not dubbed or subtitled. That is why I have not broken the seal on the package. I am not sure if I am going to risk it or not.Thank you.
2,can't remove korean subtitles,"first of all, the product arrived with the internal dvd spindle broken so some of the discs had scratches. they still played so i was ok with that. but the annoying thing is that you can't remove the korean subtitles - even when you go to the menu and try to select english or no subtitles, they just won't go away."
4,Best Ever,"Best Basketball game of all time, how did EA just drop the ball so bad on this franchise?The game play on the 2010 NCAA was ok, except you can't make the player miss dunks and lay ups just to make sure the computer wins, and YOU NEED OLD SCHOOL TEAMS IN NCAA, players only stay one year."
3,Great Cover - lousy sound quality,This was a CD replacement for my old vinyl. Same song selections but the sound quality is tinny and thin. Disappointing.
5,Wonderful song writing and sounds great.,Although not all of the songs original. They sound great. I love his versions of Hey Jude and Sugar Sugar better than the original. Funky Broadway and In the Midnight Hour are masterpeices of song writting. The CD makes Pickett rank up their with the greatest Rock 'n' Roll artists.
4,"Fascinating, fun book","My wife got the book for me from the library, not knowing if it was appropriate for me or not. It was. I devoured the book in a few days. I'm a sailor and have an interest in historically rigged vessels. This book transported me to a time and place far more interesting than my current surroundings. The writing is at times laborious, but never burdensome due to the topic. Overall it left me with profound gratitude that the author took the time to write the story, wrote it as well as she did, and withheld as little as she did. I recomend this book highly as a model for adventure, a lesson in management, and a succesful experiment despite the sinking. I wish I had been a Sophian! Since another ship sails under a similar model (and the same captain), perhaps I can be."
3,Hannah Free,This was a nice movie to watch on a very cold afternoon it made us think about our old age and the rights we lose.
4,Good story,"This movie was good, particularly when Sharon Gless is on. I didn't care for the younger Hanna. But, nicely told story."
1,not a classic....,"I liked Sharon Gless in Cagney and Lacey, but her acting in this film (like her acting in Queer as Folk) was over the top. An exaggerated character may make a strong impression, but it's the impression of a caricature rather than a sympathetic character. While I sympathize with the subject of the film, the acting and production value took away from the emotional quality leaving me unmoved."
3,Not too bad ...,I thought it was pretty good but my partner fell asleep twice trying to watch it. Up to individual taste I guess...
4,Great movie...,"Great movie....Sharon Gless does an outstanding job. Everyone should see this and be aware of the end of life issues that are present in this movie, as well as the issues surrounding LGBT people in their final years."
