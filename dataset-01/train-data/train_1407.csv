5,The go-to cookbook most nights of the week,"This is my second copy of Flash in the Pan. Now that I am retired and cooking more frequently, I find that I use this book two or three times a week. I am taking a second copy with me when I head south for the winter. The recipes are easy to follow, varied enough for every taste and absolutely delicious."
5,Great Cookbook for quick meals,"Incredible recipes that quick, easy and only use one pan!! My husband has given everything I have cooked from this book a 9 or 10."
5,Simply Amazing!,A beautiful testament to the lives of moder-day Christian martyrs. Those who have given all for Christ and for the cause of his kingdom. Wurmbrand's writing is so poetic and illuminating that it is impossible not to enjoy his works!
5,superb album,"This is one of Eddy Raven's best. My favorite tracks include In a Letter to You, Holding on to You, Island, Bayou Boys, Zydeco Lady, and A Woman's Place. If you like Eddy's music, you will love this album and will need it for his collection. I thoroughly enjoy this album."
4,A Call to Update Culture of Faith in Light of New Realities,"""Eating the Elephant"" appeals to our higher calling as rational beings to reconcile realities of existence. Troubled by inconsistencies in application of knowledge, author John Mangano sits down with us to chat about `life as we know it.' What becomes evident in reminiscing snapshots that no longer make sense is the keenness to change one's thinking to the betterment of the individual and society.Issues in religion and science that beg for responsible sense-making without censure come together in a series of vignettes compiled from the laboratory of life.Entertaining and heady, this is an honest work by a learn-ed man who still cares... the perfect exercise to stimulate apologetics thinkers and skeptics alike. ""Eating the Elephant"" provides the questions...you become the solution. My recommendation: 'Don't bite off more than you can chew.'"
5,Great read!,"This book is a terrific read and a wonderful look at life from an author who is humorous, fun, and a great storyteller. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a thoughtful and insightful look at life."
5,Murderdolls First Release,"This is Murderdolls first release it is a ep with tracks taken from there album, Beyond The Valley Of The Murderdolls, if u are a Murderdolls fan, u must simply have this to complete your collection."
5,The 'Coastie' with the mostie!,"Hasbro did an excellent job by finally releasing a Coast Guard G.I. Joe in 1999 -- The 35th Aniversary of the ""Real American Hero"". This figure has to be one of my favorite G.I. Joes this year, with my all time favorite being the Delta Soldier. If you love tons accessories then you must own this particular G.I. Joe. 'Coastie' G.I. Joe comes loaded with, an M-16 A2, a shotgun, a faux leather holster with a sidearm, a life jacket, a radio with MIC, a clipboard with paper,a pair of binoculars, a camera with a long telephoto lens, and a huge flashlight! This G.I. Joe is also extremely posable,and so the kids will have a great time playing with it. I especially liked it that Hasbro provided a brief history of the U.S. Coast Guard on the outside of the box! So now you not only get a great toy, but you also get to brief history lesson. FUN + LEARNING = G.I. Joe."
5,A Blast From the Past,"As a former Coast Guard Radioman, I purchased this figure as a birthday present for a neighbors child (I live overseas). I was so impressed with the detail that I kept the figure, and ordered a second one for the child. The toy is a fine tribute to the Guard and does raise awareness of its many missions--more importantly the kids love playing with it. I even sent one to my Father In Law as a get well present. He's X-Navy and he loved it. The general idea was to give it to his grandson, but the doll still sits on Pop's dresser i.e. it ain't going anywhere!Dave J, Muscat, Oman"
3,Every Man Has His Price,I liked this book but it was a little dry than everybody put on. It went all the way back to his childhood. But what I got the book for was to see what his wrestling creer was like but it only has 1 6 page chapter on him wrestling.
1,"No, no, no...","I'm a die-hard wrestling fan, and I had great expectations when I bought this book. Sadly, it turned out to be a complete waste of money. The book wasn't that much about wrestling, and the bits that was actually had some factual errors. It's strange, but when reading the book, it actually seemed like I know more about Ted DiBiase's WWF days than he does himself. The only thing even the slightest interesting is when he writes about the backstage ongoings in wrestling (wich he, again, doesn't do much) and the creation of the Million Dollar Man gimmick. Ted DiBiase is one of wrestling's true greats. He deserved a better biography than this. I never thought a book about wrestling could bore me to death. Sorry, Ted."
2,MILLION DOLLAR BORE,"THIS BOOK BY TED DIBIASE IS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT TED AND HIS BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN LIFE. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN SOME DETAIL ABOUT HIS WRESTLING CAREER, YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER BOOK. THE $1,000,000 MAN FILLS THIS BOOK WITH SOME EVENTS IN HIS LIFE ALONG WITH A BIT OF WRESTLING BUT ALOT OF VERSES FROM THE BIBLE AND SOME DETAILED EVENTS OF LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN. I REALLY THINK THIS BOOK IS BORING AND NOT WORTH IT FOR THE AVERAGE WRESTLING FAN."
5,"Every Man Has His Price, and Dibiase paid his well","This is one of the first pro-wrestling autobiographies I remember hearing of. Dibiase wrote this, and was popular, back before wrestling was as main stream as it is today. He was a top guy back in the day when it was still considered a joke by many, so a die hard wrestling fan will love this book. It details not only Dibiase's career, but his personal life as well. Dibiase is a great writer, which doesn't come as a surprise to any die hard wrestling fan, because he always did seem like an intelligent person. Have a nice day."
4,Learn from Ted's mistakes,I read this book because I'm a fan of professional wrestling. I came away from it thinking about my family and how precious they are. Ted shares how the grueling world of professional wrestling took its toll on his family life both as a child and an adult. There's some lessons to be learned here and Ted helps show the way.
3,Book Review,"Every Man Has His Price by Ted Dibiase is full of beneficial lessons to learn for use in life, but it is far from outstanding literature. This autobiography shows many life enriching Christian examples of how Christian's are to live under Christ's rule. Although full of positive messages Every Man Has His Price is lacking use of advanced vocabulary, symbolism, and good use of dialogue which are all vital to literature. If someone is interested in a book that shows the awesome power of God and how he can use people's lives as living testimonies, I would strongly recommend Every Man Has His Price to him or her. However, if that someone is looking for a literary sound book, this book is not for him or her."
4,Easy to read inspirational story of a pro wrestler,"I am a minister who grew up loving wresting in the mid 80's. I was in a Christian bookstore when I accidentally fell upon Ted Dibiase's new book--and read it in 2 days. I must admit, I could not put it down. He briefly spoke of wrestling in the late 70's through the mid 80's, when I was a fan. I gave it a 4 star rating because I thought it could have been more detailed--but the spiritual truths he communicates deserve a 5. Ted Dibiase proves that the Power of Jesus Christ is still alive and well--and only He can change lives! I may purchase bulk copies of this book to give to the young men I work with in the inner city of Washington, DC (who are wrestling fans)."
2,Every man will be bored,"This book was not the wrestling bio I was looking for. Dibiase doesn't go into detail about the ""unholy"" things that he has participated in during his lifetime. He instead likes to focus on the positive aspects of having God in his life. Thats all well and good but I thought the book was a wrestling bio not a 200 page infomercial for the church. Bottom line..........if you want wrestling stories and detail this is not the book for you. However, if your looking for a great story about a man's love for Jesus Christ this book is great"
2,Its o.k. I guess,The book is O.K. but I must admit I was kind of disappointed. I feel the book was really sugar coated. Ted DiBiase doesn't really get into specifics.
4,Good book about the life of a hard working wrestling superst,"Tells about Ted's life as he moved form city to city, how he had to cope with death at an early age, and how he overcame the temptations of booze and women that he saw so much of when he was on the road."
4,The story of one man's search for meaning,"This book may be short, but it speaks volumes. I grew up watching Ted DiBiase when i was younger, and I always wondered what the Million Dollar Man was like behind the scenes. This book tells the story. From what I have read in this book, Ted is a very wise man who knows that the Million Dollar Man character almost cost him his life, career, and marriage. He is a regretful man as well as he regrets not finishing college. Still, he is able to make up for it through his children as his advises them not to follow in his footsteps. When i got this book two years ago, I couldn't put it down. I finished it in about 2-3 hours. Ted's story moved me as he was trying to search for some meaning in his life. As of today, Ted is still involved in the wrestling business. He mainly gives his time to independant organizations while spilting his time as a evangelist. Ted is an example of someone you can knock down and watch him rise again. Way to go, Ted."
4,A Must Read!,I purchased this book expecting an all out hardcore wrestling biography but it was much more then that. I could not put it down. It is a great look at the pressures of growing up without parents and how much of a toll pro wrestling can put on a man's life a family.
4,Pro Wrestling isn't fake. At least not some parts.,"This was the best inspirational book I have read in a while. I am a huge pro wrestling fan and remember Ted and Virgle ""buying"" the WWF. I didn't know at that time what all Ted had been through. I love this book."
2,Don't expect any revelations: neither DiBiase or Wrestling,"Throughout the entire book, I felt as if he was holding back. For example, in talking about ""straying off the path"", he says, ""There's really no value in giving specifics here, but suffice it to say that I was not living a holy life."" Not what I expected from a biography."
4,Ted DiBiase's Fantastic Story,"Ted DiBiase was probably my favorite ""vilain"" in pro-wrestling but when you've read this book you realize that the man is the complete opposite in real life. I'll never look the man the same again, I now have a great deal of respect for what he has done in the ring and outside."
4,Introspective look into the world of wrestling.,"This book is more about Ted's personal lifestory as itis about pro wrestling. This book gives us the accountof how his father died in the ring, and his ambitiontowards football in his teen years. He also discussesthe tough times he had when he was starting out, andhis faith in religion. He also talks about his timespent away from his family and how he wanted to spendmore time with his family and less time on the road.This book is more like an autobiography than justabout pro wrestling, even though it is mentioned. Healso mentions the influence of his grandmother, andwhat a positive role model she was for him, growing up.He is a Christian for people who are wondering aboutwhich religion he follows. He doesn't preach or try toconvert anyone to his religion. He just mentions in thecontext of the book. He also talks about working forvarious bookers in the WWF, WCW, MidSouth and otherlocales during his career in the industry. I enjoyedreading it."
5,A great book by a great man,"I grew up watching Ted DiBiase when I was a young child and my father actually had the privledge to meet him. When I heard he wrote a book,I didn't exactly run out and buy it. I later saw Mr. DiBiase on the 700 Club discussing his book,but I still have not yet purchased it. I did,however,take it out from the library and,whether you're a pro wrestling fan,a troubled soul,a religious person or not,this book will grip you and never let go. This book is a bargain at whatever the price is. Very moving and inspiring."
4,coolest demolition game ever!,"I have never played a game so much fun. It has cool mini games and since then they have never made such a cool game. The only game that can compare is a new title coming out called Test Drive, Eve of Destruction. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes carnage and racing at the same time."
4,For Novelty a working product is good enough for me,"Can't really complain since the game works but I feel slightly shafted since the jewel case was broken and all the pages were missing out of the instruction booklet. But the game works fine, have played it for over 5 hours now since it arrived and I am satisfied. Also the delivery time was exceptional. I ordered it on an early Friday morning and it arrived the following Monday."
1,The Baldwin Genealogy from 1500 to 1881,"I was extremely disappointed with this book! While I know it was a reprint, the quality of the copying process from the original book was distorted with several pages almost blank. The mostly blank pages dealt with my ancestors rendering this book useless. I would not recommend purchasing this book."
5,Flowers A to Z,"Anita Lobel's Alison's Zinnia is a unique alphabet book using a circular tale to lead the reader from A to Z. Each page has one line which begins with a girl's name and a flower for that particular letter and ends with a girl's name for the next letter, ""Heather hosed a Hyacinth for Irene"". The split page illustrations show a large detailed painting of the flower on top and the story line with the alphabet letter below the text. I believe children will enjoy the challenge of the unusual names and the flowers portrayed in the picture book. In the classroom it would be a great children's literature rewrite. The students could use, for example, boys names and vegetables to create their own classroom version. Another example of her beautiful art work and her ability to capture the details of a flower are in The Rose in my Garden by Arnold and Anita Lobel."
5,A beautiful addition to any child's library!,"When my son fell in love with all things blooming, I began my search for a book about flowers. I had been searching for a book that featured several different flower types and their names, as well as color illustrations. I was so pleased when I found Alison's Zinnia! Not only are there beautiful color paintings of the different blooms, there is also a narrative that teaches the ABC's. A few of the flower types are difficult to pronounce (even for the adults out there!), and how many girls do we really know named Xantippa? Also, I was a little disappointed that all the names featured in the book were little girls. I would have liked to see some boys thrown in the mix. Especially since I bought his book for my son. But I still think that the book is a priceless addition to our family library."
5,Tranquility,I love this CD and put it on all the time when I take a relaxation bath and light candles. The music is so serene and tranquil that it almost feels magical. I have a number of relaxation cd's but this one is by far my favorite. Just great!!!
4,good fit,the shoe fit really well. the sole is a bit clunky looking though. very pleased with the arrival time. Overall a good shoe for the price
4,UNUSUAL STORY LINE,The story is unusual but not to bad if you like the plot of looking back and reviewing memories.. I felt it dragged at times.
1,Not So Great,I was not impressed at all with the story or the style of writing. Maybe it's just not to my personal taste.
1,I wish I had read the reviews first,"I have used for a few days. And here are the issues I have encountered:- every so often - this software causes my machine to hang - it starts using 100% of the CPU and returns control to me after anywhere from 1min to 4min.- if you add light fixtures - it assumes you have a gable roof. I had put a flat roof and the light fixtures show up above the wall.- It loses changes periodically. Although nothing has crashed and I save my changes regularly.- After many hours - I completed the floor plan and then when I try to add appliances, or change the floor type - it complains ""One of the walls is invalid"" and doesnt allow me to add appliances or change the floor.I am amazed there is no ""product recall"" of this piece of junk.I wish I had read the reviews before. I bought it not on Amazon but another store."
1,This is Authentic?,"This cookbook is going straight to Goodwill. Cabbage with Italian seasoning? Yogurt, canned tuna, canned carrots? Here's the basic soup recipe-meat and/or vegetableswaterbouillion cubesCook until tender.Actually I think half the recipes had boullion cubes. Yuk.If you want a GOOD introduction to German cooking try GERMAN COOKING by Ruth Malinowski, Patricia Sinclair, and Alinda Nelson. I'm pretty sure it't out of print but I was able to find a used copy."
3,"Good Content, Bad Cover","The Recipes are authentic and comprehensive, thought a little bit too south-German for my liking (I'm north-German). Thus, nothing to complain about the content. But nevertheless I was upset when I got the book, especially since it meant to be a present. It's a ring-book: top and a back held together by a couple of plastic rings. This is not a hardcover, this is something every copy shop does for $1.99."
3,"Good for History and Showing, not much else","This book is not a complete overview of the boxer in any meaningful sense. While it does have occasional chapters which apply to boxers in general, the majority of this book is devoted to history of the breed and information on showing the dog. Most of the generally applicable information on the Boxer was hopelessly biased, with the general portrayal being that Boxers are born dignified and noble. The entire first 150-160 pages are nothing but history of famous boxers and similar information. If this is your cup of tea, you'll love this book. Personally, I'd hoped for a little more practical information."
1,Disappointing--Needs a proofreader before the next reprint,"I had a very difficult time getting through this book. The grammatical errors and typos really bothered me.The author skips over some very major events in her life, but devotes an inordinate amount of time on minor details. Entire paragraphs are adjective-riddled and hard to keep one's interest. Examples of this are incredibly long, drawn out descriptions of parking her vehicle in a parallel spot, noting directions from a restaurant to a person's house, turn-by-turn, and lots of very boring conversations and observations, etc. Too much minutia, and not enough substance in my opinion."
2,meloncholey.....,"when I bought Volume 2 blueray of UC gundam, I was expecting to contiune from where the volume 1 DVD left off from. I was wrong. the DVD has both the first and the second episode. Volume two blueray is just episode 2.My recomendation is do not buy this if you alreay own Volume one DVD of UC gundam.That is all."
3,Strange film...,"Take five or six British sitcom actors, one young American 'hearthrob' who can't act to save his life, a really strange story, and you've got 'The Mumbo Jumbo'.If you're a fan of Brian Blessed, Richard O'Brien, Sylvester McCoy, Josephine Tewson, or John Inman, then you might enjoy this just for their parts in this very dumb movie. Or if you just get a kick out of penis jokes, then perhaps you'll find this amusing."
1,"decisions, decisions","Well, if you have not seen CCS, this can be an ok volume. However, you'll be disappointed if you have watched the original japanese version Card Captor Sakura. Nelvana erased important scenes and does not make as much sense. If you don't like to read subtitles or listen to japanese language, this video is for you.(although listening to japanese helps you learn it! ^_^) I do recomend watching cardcaptors and then the original version to compare , contrast, and decide which one do you preffer."
2,Grandparents New to Anime,"My husband got interested in the American version of this series (he's a kid at heart), but I just could not stay interested in it. From what I could see, too much of it just did not make sense.Then, we decided to buy the DVD's for my husband. We bought 3 of them and then I noticed the Sakura/original Japanese version and bought Vol. 1 of that series. We are both now hooked on the original Japanese Cardcaptor Sakura series. The story is delightful to follow and makes the whole thing make so much more sense.I admit that every now and then we have to hit the pause button so we can read the English subtitles when things get moving fast, but this has in no way dimished our enjoyment.We highly recommend that anyone interested in this series try the Japanese version."
1,"Avoid Bad Dub, Get the Pioneer Version","Cardcaptor Sakura is a wonderful series and I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone. However, people should not be tricked into thinking that Cardcaptors is the same thing as Cardcaptor Sakura. They most certainly are not. If you are thinking about purchasing this dvd, do yourself a favor and instead buy Cardcaptor Sakura Vol. 1- The Clow. Not only will you get the original storyline from the japanese series and spare yourself the complete hack job Nelvana did attempting to put it on the American market; you will get more episodes and a storyline that makes more sense. I think if you read more of the reviews you will find that those who have seen both Cardcaptors and Cardcaptor Sakura agree that Cardcaptors is no more than a grotesque cut and paste editing project on a fantasic series."
1,(...),"absolutely NO plot, completely butchered, not intresting. this is a dubdubdubdubdubdubdub of CCSakura, with no plot/ storyline besides mindless card captoring/transforming. in scenes where Li is *supposed* to be blushing, they change the dialouge, but have him blushing. The last episode out of like 20 (suposed to have 70) is totally dumb, with such a bad cliffhanger (that cuts out the 2nd movie) that ends the series on a bad note. WIll Li come back? Goodness, it seems like Sakura is hoping that he will come back so that she will have all her friends. All the character's personalities are gone, so I recommed you don't buy this. Go get the VHS with subtitles- you'll at least get the real thing, even if the subtitles aren't that um good. At least they are 80% accurate."
3,THIS IS THE DEAL PEOPLE,"Listen, can't somebody accept that there ARE scences cut in CC, CC is totally unique to CCS, it barely resembles. I got the [first] volume on VHS for $1.00 at some cheap store or whatever. I don't remember exactly everything about CC but more about CCS. Just one thing: How come you torture girls in America and boys? Stop sterotyping people!!!! Sure the odds of a boy sitting down to watch a romance is pretty slim it could still happen and a girl could sit down and watch Pokemon without the obsession of the AAMR realtionship. Sure the review is alot to late to write but whatever and Carly McKillip, you should be gentle to your character, don't you think, well your voice isn't the big chunk of it, its those cut scences and junk. Ok I've done."
3,Good but...,"...it should be more episodes on it!I LOVE Card Captor Sakura,both the animé and the manga.But this..."
1,How *dare* they?!!???!!!!!!,"And I thought the Sailor Moon dub/hack was bad.Plenty of people have said it already, but I thought I'd add my voice to the chorus: this dub is just awful! Nelvana had a treasure of an adorable show to bring to America and turned it into a hole-ridden, unemotional, and otherwise just WRONG series of events strung together in no sensible order. I wouldn't have believed it was possible to ruin a show this badly. What *were* they thinking????"
5,This anime will get you hooked for more.,"I loved Card Captor Sakura when I first saw it. The characters are so cute. It has a nice plot. The series is pretty long(which is good). This anime is really good. I dont care if you dont like it,but give other people a chance to decide on it. I belive I bought all the episodes and the 2 movies. I hope clamp makes more well you may like it you may not but you really should watch it.I just hope they show it on tv again where i live.^_^"
4,Card Captors verse Cardcaptor Sakura,"First of all I was reading the reviews from the other people who have seen the show, and think they are being unjust to the WB version. I have seen both the cut and the uncut version of the show, and like them both. Even though I do think you lose alot when you dub a show, this still has the charm of the orginal version. But back to what I was trying to get across, have to remember the audience that the show is geared to, young girls. Japan has a more open society so stuff that wouldn't be appropriate for our children is appropriate for theirs. The reason I like anime so much is because of the stories and the animation. This series is no exception. If you are buying the series for your 10 year daughter or son then I would go with the WB version but if you like me who a sorphmore in college and can handle what going on in the series, then by all means get the subtitle one."
1,"The ""dont buy it"" review here has a good point","I don't even know why this was released.... It says that this video has 3 episodes in english(awww man, those not so great voice actors, half-way bad music, super episode cutting, no plot stuff???)... Why make a video on it when each of these episodes has aired like a million times each??? If any of you want to see these over and over again, either get the japenese version (a billion times better) or wait till they air these episodes again and record it!"
1,This is not series we adore,"Card Captors revolves around a boy named Li Showron who must seal the magic Clow Cards before they destroy the world. He must also put up with a non-emotional twit named Sakura who *always* gets in the way when capturing cards, especially with her ditzy friend Madison, who follows her around with a camcorder all day for no apparent reason. However, the original version of this dislikable dub, Card Captor Sakura, is not like that at all. Card Captor Sakura was tremendously changed when it was dubbed into Card Captors. Personalities, episodes, and plotlines were either completely altered or deleted. The voices were not given much consideration when cast, the scripts were re-written and are now very unoriginal and annoying, and episodes were cut up and actually spliced with other episodes to avoid plotlines that were deleted. In addition, Sakura was the main character and actually had emotions. I love Card Captor Sakura and it literally hurts when I watch Card Captors."
1,A complete disgrace,"This video is not worth the tape it is printed on. It bears little resemblance to the far superior show it was taken from, Cardcaptor Sakura (which I would highly recommend!), aside from the animation and such. The dialog is very poorly written, the voices were ill-cast for many characters (Kero stands out as being particularly horrible), the story was changed, the characters suddenly all act very stuck-up... I can't think of a single good thing to say about this except that the animation is quite nice. Whatever you do, don't get this poor imitation - get the *real* Cardcaptor Sakura, which is uncut and unedited, the way the show was meant to be seen."
1,Don't waste your money...,"This is nothing but a butchering of Cardcaptor Sakura. Where CCS excels, Cardcaptors flops completely - the plot is hardly explained (and completely out of order), the characters are changed from being interesting and lovable to being stuck up and impossible to relate to, the appropriate music has been replaced with stuff my little sister could play on a Casio.... There is very little value in this show, especially since it also teaches that a show is not worth anything unless the main female character is dumbed down and a male character played up to be the main character instead. This sets a bad example for all. If you want something worth your time and money, you should check out the unedited version. It's an entirely different show, and it's wonderful."
1,"What has CLAMP done to you guys, Nelvana?","Ok... Let me get this straight... Nelvana decides to sell the butchered version of the re-runs??? These three episodes were all aired like a million times, so wheres the point in buying this?If anybody really wants this, just go out, by a blank tape and wait for these episodes to air again!(I'll worry if these don't) Trust me... save your money guys..."
2,Chopped up Version,"Unless you are buying this for little children, I advise going with the Uncut subtitled version. Since the Subtitled version is only a few dollars more, you don't even really save any money by getting this chopped up version, like you would for other series."
1,Yuck.,"If watching butchered anime is your idea of fun, go ahead and buy this tape. Otherwise, buy the uncut, subtitled Cardcaptor Sakura tapes."
2,cardcaptors turned to hellcaptors !,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! THEY RUINED THE BEST SHOW ON EARTH!!! they took out the music and put a ugly back ground , the realatonship with li and meilin horrible the are suppose to be cousins and fiancee`s but nelvana didnt like the idea ! sakura`s voice is disgusting like she reatch puberty a few years earlier! li`s voice sounds like a kid! kero ! poor kero! it`s voice sounds like a DYING SURFER MAN ! dont buy this crappy video get the CARDCAPTOR SAKURA NOT CARDCAPTORS ! plz u guys get this video for the kids but older kids get CARDCAPTOR SAKURA! nelvana made this show more boyish than girlish just to make the show popular by boys ! oh god nelvana why ? they made HUGE cuts ! for no reason! anyways just dont by this in my opinion but if u want buy get this on ur own risk guys !"
5,An excellent series!,"First off, to those who rated this product and any of the other dubbed Cardcaptors products as horrible, I'd like to say something: You only think the dubbed version is horrible because you are used to the subtitled version! I, personally, grew up to the dubbed episodes; and so, when I watch the original Cardcaptor Sakura, I think that /their/ version is horrible. It is all a matter of opinion, and that's that. If you don't like the dubbed version, DON'T BUY IT. Seriously.Anyway, on to the review.I've always been a fan of the Cardcaptors series, even though I am just now starting to buy the show on DVD and VHS. The characters were fun, the plot was engaging, and the action was fairly constant. However, I found that sometimes the episodes, when being watched, seemed slightly short and abrupt. That aside, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves anime and fantasy."
1,Oh god noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!,PLEASE DO NOT BUY CARDCAPTORS!... Try Cardcaptor Sakura/Card Captor Sakura (just different spellings)... it is the original Japanese version and you can the videos and DVDs from Amazon. The English dub is NOT worth the money at all! If only some people knew just how bad it really is compared to the Japanese... Sakura and Tomoyo(Madison) sound like little brats in the English dub.. and all the romance and funny scenes are cut making each episode about 5 minutes shorter than it really should be! Names are changed and they always pretend that they're not in Japan... it is sooooo edited any good Cardcaptor Sakura site on the internet will tell you just how bad it is! I could go on forever but please... do yourself a favour and buy Cardcaptor Sakura not Cardcaptors!
1,Not Worth It,"Skipped the first 7 episodes, bad dubbing, 10 minutes edited out of the original episode, doesn't even have the English version of the Kero-chan ni Omakese (Kero's Corner) as broadcasted here in Canada. Why waste your money on this load of crap when you can get the UNCUT subtitled version by adding a few dollars more?"
1,Isn't there a zero stars rating???,"I still can't understand what's the big idea of buying ""this"" if you have the uncut versión. this is not a TV show, this is trash, Nelvana really disgraced a great anime series. I don't know where to begin. The character names, the name of the town (Clow has nothing to do with that town), the relationship between Shyaoran and meilin, the order of the episodes. Even the the part where you can learn something.... IT IS ALL CUT OUT. if you want to see a girl and a boy getting cards....No, don't buy it, buy cardcaptor sakura instead, even if all you want to see i a girl catching cards, duy cardcaptor sakura, there are even mor cards (since it has every episode)..."
3,pretty good,"Even though I like Cardcaptors, I think the dub is really stupid. They cut out half of everything, and now the story doesn't even make sense! Be like me, buy the sub!"
2,Ruined,"Cardcaptors was butchered very badlyfrom the original Japanese version. This new series by Nelvana (grr.. I hate you!) is missing many episodes and the story is somewhat different. They wanted to turn this heart-warming girls' series into a action-packed boys' series (which it is not!). In the series (refering to TV) scenes with Sakura's grandfather was taken out because it would have seemed inappropriate for an action series. They also changed relationships and feelings, such as Syaoran's (Li) love for Yukito (Julian), Chiharu (Chelsea) and Takashi's (Zachary) relationship, Meiling's (Meilin) feelings and relationship with Syaoran (Li), and so much more.If you are into the series, I recommend Cardcaptor Sakura, the un-dubbed and untampered series. It is so much more satifying."
4,It was good =),"Okay I personally thought the movie was great! I like the charactors and the plotlines! I never miss it when its on the WB! Okay but about that one review that said this is horrible and that Card Captor Sakura is muuuuch better. Well thats all high and dandy that you had the OPPORTUNITY to watch the original versions, but for many people the dub is all there is! And I mean, the artwork is still very beautiful, and the plotline is still followable! Aaaand if you haven't figured out why Madison follows Sakura around with a camera then you obviously dooon't watch the show (which is understandable seeing as you hate it) and so I mean, just cause you don't watch it you are making false accusations at it. And plus, if you had seen ANY episodes, you would know that Sakura is STILL the main charactor, not Li. Okay? Hmm...anyway, I recomend this movie, it was very nice =)"
5,First rate!,"Cardcaptors volume 1: Tests of Courage is anime at its finest! This video has the episodes Sakura's Rival, Time and Again, and The Cave, as seen on KidsWB. The animation in this series is really beautiful; every frame is a work of art. The story is good, and most of all the characters are wonderful, particularly the main character, Sakura Avalon. I love this video and highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Wonderfully made video set!!!,"I got these videos recently to help me plan a float trip on the Kongakut. All I can say is ""WOW"". The quality of these videos far surpassed my expectations. I was just looking for some insights into the canyon section of the river that has some class III rapids (in June). What I found was a lesson on wildlife, hiking, rafting, and river travel. Tons of insights were offered within the video and commentary provided. Tastefully offered and there was no babbling to fill camera time. Wonderful images of the land, auffice, caribou, birds, etc.. and I feel like I have already been to the area. I am certainly less fearful of tackling this river myself after watching the videos. Certainly a river that is as remote as this one demands respect, but to have seen it so intimately prior to taking the trip is a huge benefit. My hats off to the fellows that put this video set together. Job well done!"
2,Not for everyone...,"It might have been my fault...perhaps the description of the book was not full, or I didn't read it carefully enough. In any case, the sum total of this book is a listing of every episode's stars, music, author, etc. That's about it. Minimal or no story description or highlights. If you really need to know who directed an epidose in the twelfth season, then this is for you. If you don't care that much, then find a more interesting book."
1,Essentials? Hardly that,"I was greatly dissappointed in the book. While it has some interesting points of view, it is so slanted the book should be a trapizoid and not rectangular. I disagreed on several of the ratings. All in all, I much prefer The Discontinuity Guide by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping. While at times they disagree on their reviews, they are fair in their outlook."
3,For Casual Fans Only,"""Pocket Essentials: Doctor Who"" is basically a watered down version of the Howe/Stammers/Walker collection of handbooks, complete with reviews, quotes and observations. This would certainly serve the casual fan, although die-hard fans would find it difficult to get anything new from it. At least it is up to date with reviews of the two Dalek films, the Big Finish Audios, the stage plays and various other television spin-offs. What is noticeable is that author, Mark Campbell, doesn't hold back in his reviews, being very blunt about what he does and doesn't like."
5,great anthology,"this is an excellent and wide-ranging compilation of swing tenor saxophonists. appropriately, lots of the selections from from the Basie band recordings, with excellent air checks -- you can hear Jimmy Rushing in the background. Note particularly fine selections featuring Illinois Jacquet. also Swing Shift, with superb work by the underrated Buddy Tate. And a fine version of Sweet Georgia Brown, featuring Paul Bascomb. the citation for Lotta Sax Appeal on this site says that it's from the Erskine Hawkins band, but it is in fact Andy Kirk with the almost always perfect Dick Wilson on tenor. For that song alone, buy the disk (or download it) Hey Amazon, how about providing liner notes on downloaded albums?????"
5,"""I'm an American baby, our names don't mean s***""","This is the original screenplay of 1994's top movie, Pulp Fiction. If you haven't seen this flick, do so. Right now. Afterwards, buy this trade paperback and relive all the high points of the film. The stories are great, the characters leap from the pages, and the dialogue is tight and witty. It's $12.95 well spent, if only so you can deliver all the cool lines at parties. My favorite bit of dialogue involves Butch, a boxer, and Esmerelda, a cab driver.Butch: ...Esmarelda Villalobos--is that Mexican?Esmerelda: The name is Spanish, but I'm Colombian.B: It's a very pretty name.E: It means ""Esmerelda of the wolves.""B: That's one hell of a name you got there, sister.E: Thank you. And what is your name?B: Butch.E: Butch. What does it mean?B: I'm an American, baby, our names don't mean s***."
5,Very fine writing that increases with every page.,"An engrossing, well-crafted tale. Some very fine writing that increases with every page. Maulucci superbly captures the charms of Montreal."
2,Disappointing,"This program costs way too much to not even offer screen resizing. I use a 19"" monitor at a fairly high resolution. When I run Britanica, everything is cram-jambed into a small NON-RESIZABE window. The content seems OK, but not noticably more usefull compared to the single CD Encarta 2000 I thought I was upgrading. It installed reliably except the audio-only files are unintelligible. It is too late for me, save yourselves. Buy something else."
2,impossible to use,"The user interface for this product is so difficult. When you click on a word just to highlight it, the software will look up the word. Also, it is impossible to print out long article to read because the software break up articles into little section. But it does not let you print the whole article. You have to print out a small section each time."
1,"Well, I have MUCH better encyclopedia to offer.....","Why pay 70.00 for a buggy, non-resizable DVD version, when you can get all this an MORE for free off of the greatest encyclopedic volume in history? It is called the internet, and it is FREE, aside from the general access fee. You can have the lastest news, pictures and science reports, plus whitepapers, articles in biomedicine, physics, chemistry, mathematics, et cetera. Why pay for a 'version' of knowledge when you can have it all, not doled out in discreet dollops of creamy unsatisfaction like Britannica and Encarta? If you want to pay for learning and knowledge, the currency is determination."
3,Mixed Feelings Towards This CD Player....,"In the 1st couple of weeks after buying this CD player, when I plug it in the wall via universal adapter, it would play a while before it abruptly cuts off & it'll be a while before I can cut it back on. This never happens when I use batteries, but since this player is for home use, this was becoming a problem.Since then, it very rarely cuts off when I plug it into the wall. That said, I really like this disc player design despite its small buttons. You can program up to 21 tracks on it, & it does have repeat & shuffle features. However, it's hard for me to recommend this considering the issues I had with it early on. If you plan on only using batteries to run it, you may be fine. Otherwise you may want to look elsewhere for a portable CD player."
2,Horrible,"I got this CD player around Christmas and was really excited to try it out. The first day everything went fine, it played CDs well, albeit there was some static and skipping, though very little.Later I put in a CD, clicked play, and waited. Nothing.The screen displayed No Disk. I was puzzled. There was a disk inside. It was clean...no fingerprints or scratches. After a few minutes I gave up.The next day, I tried it again..this time it worked. But now its not. The screen says No Disc, and there isn't anything wrong with the CD.I do not recommend this CD player..its very faulty and unreliable."
2,Coby Slim Personal CD Player not what I expected.,I wanted a CD player to listen to audio books while I walked. This does not fill the bill. It skips when I walk causing me to have to hold it in my hand. It does not stay at the same place on the CD when I turn it off causing me to have to fast forward to find the correct place that I last listened to on the CD.Amazon was timely in the delivery of the CD.
1,trash,I'd like to send this to you all FREE!This is obsolete...outdated...trash...don't buy it. Mine will go in the garbage.
2,just buy something else,"dont bother-the cheap price isnt worth it in this case - just buy an industry standard instead - some time it works, and then it doesnt"
1,"HORRIBLE, DON'T BUY!","I got this portable CD player to listen to a relaxation CD at night when I go to bed. The first two nights, the CD player worked fine. The third night, it shut off halfway through the CD (and the CD is only 40 mins. long). By the next morning, the CD player was not working at all. I tried a bunch of diferent CD's, put in new batteries, but nothing. It's dead. I had thrown out the package, so I was not able to return it. This product is garbage. Don't waste your money. I wish I could give it zero stars."
2,"Cuts off in midsong, hard to get working.","I'm not sure if this is a product issue, or due to the shipping, but it turns itself off with just the slightest bump. I only brought it because we aren't allowed to have our mp3 players at work but are allowed to have a cd player. If you'll looking for something like that, cheapper isn't better, go with something a little better; if you'll looking for something more long term and can get/use a MP3 player, do the research and get a MP3 player that fits you'll needs."
2,Never Even Worked!,I ordered 7 of these to be used in my classroom so my students could enjoy listening to books on CD during our literacy period. One of them never even worked but by the time I got to put them into use the experation to return them was up. Two of them the lids have broken off..making use difficult. The price was right but the quality was wrong.
4,good book for yoga lovers,"This book is full of photos and detailed and clear descriptions of the moves. I plan to use the book a great deal and work the moves into my yoga routine. Even so, I'm not sure that it would be enough for someone who has no yoga experience. Also, I was looking for recommendations about other yoga moves I'm more familiar with (eg, ""Don't do the cobra"" ""the cat is great for pregnant women"") and it wasn't there."
2,disappointed...,"I have been practicing vinyassa/flow and anusara yoga for quite a while now. I am in my first trimester and am desparate for a book that tells me what yoga poses are safe and what are not, and what modifications I can make to yoga poses when I am in class. I find this book totally not helpful - after going through two-thirds of the book I am still clueless what poses are safe... the exercises in the book are way too gentle and somewhat boring - most are just breathing in various positions. OK if someone is just starting yoga but it doesn't do it for someone who wants to continue a more physical practice."
2,My opinion: this body wash is overpriced.,"I gave this body wash 2 stars because it does wash off surface dirt. I am very unhappy with the underlying medicinal-herbal scent, and this body wash did not get beyond surface dirt to clean places and things that really need cleaning. I do not believe this body wash is worth the $18.00 price charged for it. Lather, Inc.: can't you pretty up the smell and add some cleaning pizzaz to your body wash?"
5,Architectsmustbuy,"This is a great book! The cartoons are fresh, insightful, and very funny. Any architect will enjoy!"
2,"Flawed ""feature""","This timer has a design flaw, instead of changing the design to fix the flaw, the defect was incorporated as a ""feature"". The timer does not ring at zero, as other timers do, and is the base function of a timer, instead it rings at one minute. The instructions in the package claim this is a warning ring to let you know time is almost up. I'm keeping the one I got because it is red, and matches my kitchen, and I like how it looks in general. However I took a marker and wrote a note reminding me to add 1 minute to my time, so I will get a ring when it SHOULD ring."
1,"Amco 60 Minute Timer, Red","1 month of use and it does not work!!It is broken; does not turn; does not ring and is now worthless! I would say I have used it 13 times tops and no children are playing with it! Definitely this is not the timer you want to spend money on if you want it to work for very long! The design,appeal and color is nice but even with very careful care it did not last and now we are out the money and a timer!!"
1,Horrible quality,"This timer looks nice, and for the first 1 and a half months, it worked fine.Then it just stopped working today. Horrible quality!!! I would not recommend wasting your money on this."
5,Timer,I love it because it is small enough to take out of the kitchen with me if I need to leave the room...........................and the ringer is nice and loud
1,Didn't work for me,"Although the Amco timer looks cool it didn't work for me. The timer ""ring"" is way too short - a second and that's it. And the bell is not loud enough. The bell rings even if the timer is in the ""off"" position which prompted me to write this review - today, out of nowhere the bell on the Timer started ringing loudly for ten seconds. So when you want the Timer to ring loud and long it won't and when you don't want it to ring at all it rings loudly for 10 seconds or more. Made in China. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I may just use it as a paperweight."
1,Doesn't Ding,The one I received keeps time correctly but it never dings when the timer is done. I took it apart to try and fix it but couldn't figure it out. I also couldn't find any articles online on how to fix a kitchen timer. I can't believe I spent ten dollars on this thing.
1,Does not ring...,Nothing happens when the timer hits 0. It seems that there are other customers who encountered this issue. A regrettable purchase.
1,Non-Durable -- A Waste of Money,"This timer lasted fewer than 50 uses. Eventually, when I would set the time, it would start ticking away and then shortly thereafter it would stop and the bell would never ring.When it worked it was fine. It's light, good-looking and simple to use; just turn the dial all the way around and then turn it to the number of minutes you want it to count down. Once the time has passed it rings.However, all of that is irrelevant when the product stops working after hardly any use at all."
1,cute but broken,"Bought this last year and I still love the retro look of it. It was already a bit annoying because of the short ring (maybe 1 second) that is easy to miss, but now after 1 year of infrequent use, it has totally stopped working.Which is too bad - because it is still awfully cute. Do not waste your money."
3,Summer thriller,"I thought this sounded like a great summer thriller novel for teens, and it was.I just thought some of it was a bit to unrealistic. Caitlin's mother was way out of control and I dont believe that she'd have custody of the kids when everyone knew about her drug abuse. You'd think her dad would want to save her and her brother Luke from the disaster. Another very unrealistic thing is Luke, who's 11 talks and acts like he's 18 or older. Yes, it's a work of fiction, but I tend to like books which have a bit of a realistic feel to them.Another thing, it reminds me a lot of V.C. Andrews types of books. Horror and thriller mixed with troubled teens in a deserted type place."
3,it was ok,"better then shelter me but still not my kind of book. not bad just not good but hey the man wrote a book, more then I can say."
5,Excellent,"I picked this book up because the cover is great, and what I read on the back sounded interesting. However, I had no idea that this would turn out to be such a well written, compelling novel.Lost Summer is a thriller, but also a sharp analysis of a teen trying to make sense of her disintegrating family. As it builds to its disturbing finale, you can't help but feel part of Caitlin's tangled life. Alex McAuley has written a subtle and complex character here, one that I would like to see in more books.One word of caution is that this novel deals with mature themes, including sex, some drug use and violence, which means it is appropriate mainly for readers 15 and up."
2,"Adequate entertainment for young children, mind-numbingly boring for adults","The plot doesn't get interesting until about three-quarters of the way through the film. Until then, the audience is subjected to various scenes of Benji galavanting through the town or suburbs and having brief interactions with rather anonymous townsfolk."
2,Backwards Letters,"I was very happy to get these, as my two year old is recognizing her letters, but dismayed to find that several of the letters are backwards with the texture on the wrong side. My daughter is autistic and doesn't understand that she needs to have half of the letters texture side up and half texture side down in order to read them correctly. I should have spent more on a better set."
5,great starter course,"Good teacher. I thought the Pimsleur course was pretty good but this guy is even better. He spells out new words,which was a big help to me."
3,Speak Spanish with Michael Thomas,"I purchased this for my son and unbeknownst to me, it is written in Castillian. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to follow. We do not use the castillian form of speaking spanish. He finds it very difficult to follow. Live and learn!"
2,Not what I expected.,"Perhaps I have not given this enough time, but at this point I am not really enthusiastic about this tape. I wish I had made another selection when purchasing."
1,Very Annoying,I bought this system because I had heard good things about it. It was horrible. His voice is so grating and irritating that I listened for about 20 minutes (all I could stand) and never listened to it again. His pronounciation of the words was awful. I have some friends that speak Spanish fluently and the way they say them and the way he says them are completely different. I would not recommend this to anyone. I found that the Pimsleur products are much better.
5,Originality makes up for flaws,"Great story with a noir esque feel, the 60's background is interesting but not over emphasizedSome of the male characters look a bit similiar but the great if flashy overall designs make up for it."
3,The Baptizing of America,It appears to me that too many conclusions are reached that stretch the facts.
5,An Eye-Opener for Everyone concerned about the Religious Right!,"Whether you see this author as a Prophet to be heeded or as a silly Chicken Little over reacting, it makes you open your eyes and look more carefully at what is going on. There is much more truth in what he says than I was aware of and it greatly concerns me - especially as a faithful Christian who finds much of the Religious Right's views repulsive and very much opposite of my views on Christianity and what God's Love encompasses."
5,Great Movie,"I loved this movie, and its hard to find, so if you see it don't hesitate to buy it. I thought the movie was funny and Entertaining for a cartoon. Gambit has a great part in it. Over all it fun to watch!"
3,Less than desirable!,"Most of the music on this CD is very nice. However, some of the tracks have nearly no volume, while others would take the roof off the house. This detracts greatly from the entire collection. I have to constantly pump up the volume in order to hear some tracks, then ramp it down on others because it is too loud."
3,Not Bad,"The smell (cool mint) was pleasant without being overwhelming, and it was good to my sensitive skin causing no extra irritation, but I did not care for the consistency...too runny and would pile up and drip off my face after passing the razor through it. Using less helps a little with that.I would buy it again, but am trying other options first."
4,Good Stuff,"I just switched to double edged razors. I needed a good soothing shaving product.I heard mention of Kiss My Face, so I gave it a try.Kiss My face Mint does what it should. It lathers nicely with my shaving brush; it is very slippery, so the shave goes smooth; and it leaves my fave clean selling, soft and not dries out. The cream itself is very ""gooey"" and slippery. The only draw back is it looks like hand lotion or soft soap. I need to move it away from the sink so my visitors don't waste it on their hands. ;-)I came back to buy another bottle, this time I'll try a different flavor."
2,Less than perfect,"I bought ""Master the Catholic High School Entrance Exams - 2002"" for my 8th grader.I have found an average 1% error rate in the two HSPT exams - totally unacceptable. I expect zero defects in a book like this - not a good example to set to young people.Very disappointing!"
1,Don't be misled by the title,"While I have no quarrel with Kessinger, and while this volume is reasonably priced for what it is, it is by no means the Complete Works of John Gower. It is only one of the four volumes of that collection, the one containing the second half of the Confessio Amantis (books 5-8), and the poem ""In Praise of Peace,"" along with some editorial matter, including the glossary and Proper Name index. The reproduction of the volume is not badly done; though some pages have a darkened background, they are quite readable. Without the other three volumes (or at least the one with the first four books of the Confessio), this edition is of limited utility. Unless you are looking specifically for Macaulay's notes on the latter half of the poem, his index, or ""In Praise of Peace,"" you can find a better edition of the Confessio for this price. I recommend Peck."
2,This ain't extreme,"i was very satisfied when i bought extreme evolution. however path of destruction isn't has hardly any extreme matches. you get 7 average matches, none suck, but they aren't great. if you want to see big bumps don't get this DVD. stick with RF Video or Extreme evolution. hopefully the next DVD from ECW will be more hardcore. But if you are a hardcore ECW fan or just a respectable fan then you should buy the DVD, you will get your money's worth. If you just like big bumps, save your 25 bucks."
1,Wrestling and Acting,"Eight great reviews and now this? Well, it's true, after viewing this uncensored version of ""extreme wrestling"" I'm more amazed than ever that there are people buying into this embarrassing spectacle. This isn't fighting ~ it's acting, and while I give these men and women applause for their athletic ability, the nearly three hours of staged bashing is overkill and exhausting in its boredom. Even DVD cannot fast-forward through this quickly enough. In fairness, I was hoping for something akin to the Ultimate Fighting Championships, which this is not, but what I got was far below the caliber of even a schoolyard brawl."
4,A DVD that reminds us why ECW used to be good...,"This is a good DVD. The Malenko-Guerrero match is worth the price alone, and Sabu vs Sandman is a must-see for hardcore fans. The Pillman shoot interview from Cyberslam 1996 is simply classic and one of the better promos ever done. What is wrong with the DVD then? The Rotten vs Rotten death match is mindless crap and some of the promos left me wondering why they were even included. Overall though, a very solid purchase."
3,Decent,"I get all my ECW from ECW666 Videos. They have every ECW show in its entirety and are authentic, not Vince's version. Check them out at http://ecw666.cjb.net . I get my videos within 3 days of ordering and they have the best prices hands down..."
3,ECW's second mainstream video,"Fans of the now-defunct ECW will find much to enjoy about this, their second national video release. It includes such classic moments as Francine's heel turn, RVD winning the TV title, and the infamous ""Stairway To Hell"" match between Sandman and Sabu.While this is a very good tape, I don't feel they helped fully show fans what ECW was all about. The matches were great but they could have shown some classic promos and a few other moments. All in all, it is still a good tape that any wrestling fan would enjoy."
3,Another Likable Actioner with Modest budget that is better than the politically stupid Lethal Weapon!,"Despite Van Cleef's age, it's kinda a joy to seehe and Carradine (both vets of many of these kindof pics) together as Father and Son vet team (!!)taking on the evil and murderous Mako over stolenjade artifact. Many recognisable faces here and alldo well in their roles (especially Mr. 'The HillsHave Eyes, Berryman). If not taken too seriously,it's a good 'Guy's Actioner'. Fred Olen Ray andCarradine did three good cheapies together (andDawn Wildsmith was in all three)!"
4,Interesting,"Good visuals, interesting ideas, and an easy read. However, you can tell these renovations are for the wealthy. If you're able to take these ideas and do them yourself then it's a great visual aid."
5,Still cutting edge,"I admit that I am a late comer to the likes of Duane Eddy. And what a price I paid!! Duane travels over the fret board like few I have ever heard even some 40 years after this album came out. 'Rebel Rouser' is a pioneering album even by today's standards. The Peter Gunn theme is classic, Rebel Rouser even more so and on theme of Dixie what a job Duane does! What I like about Duane's music is his eagerness to use the lower frets so the solos are in a lower key. It is quite the contrast to today's high fret use where notes are so high they easily get garbled. What a nice change and what a great CD."
2,Who wants to read about getting in trouble?,"This book, although cleverly written and beautifully illustrated, is one my kids turn away from routinely! ""Harriet"" gets in trouble in a new way on every page! While this is an accurate representation of many childhood days, I don't think kids want to read about it. Getting in trouble happens enough in real life!"
4,cute story,Harriet is your typical preschoolers. She is curious about the world. As she explores the world she gets into trouble. She really doesn't mean to be bad it just happens. Her mother tries not to yell but as the day goes on Harriet causes more and more trouble for her mom. Her mother breaks down and yells at Harriet. Harriet is very upset and starts to cry. Her mother then takes a deep breath and tell Harriet that she sorry.This book is good to show that everyone had bad days. It shows that even parents have bad days and make mistakes sometimes.I would recommend this book for read aloud times. There are not may words per page and will keep the attention of kids of all ages. They will be able to relate to Harriet in her day to day activities and how she sometimes just happens to get into trouble with out trying to.
4,Harriet You'll Drive Me Wild,"I liked this book, especially the dog. I think it was nice of the mom not to yell at Harriet, even though she was mad at her. I would recommend this book because what Harriet does is very funny. I also liked the book because it was about what Harriet did through out the day.by Michel B."
3,Spiral Earrings IS 14 Kt Rose Gold,"The earrings are unique but very ""flimsy"". I haven't worn them yet and truly hope they will stand up to normal wear. I will keep them for several reasons...1) Harry Mason guarantees them 2) I like the style 3) I need the Rose Gold 4) they are unique. Besides the extremely light weight of the solid 14 Kt. Gold, I think the price was a bit high. I would not have purchased them if I had to pay the additional $7.95 that Harry Mason charges for s/h...thanks Amazon for that perk."
3,Not really what I was looking for,The book is useful but I find the songs difficult to follow and not very teachable. Not really what I had hoped to use.
5,Protect the galaxy... I mean home ...with you're lightsaber,"This saber is the coolest thing I have in my room! It is fun to power up and to power down. It looks and feels like it came right out of the Stars Wars universe! Just swinging it over my head makes me feel like Anakin!! Though this item has no educational value to it, it is fun to own the most wanted and envied toy in town. Love dueling with it because it makes clashing and sizzling sounds when it is hit against something solid (like another lightsaber) . I was amazed at how bright the LED lights lit up. It filled my whole darkened room up! Though the blade (which is made of polycarbonate) can be a little wobbly, it can be hit upon other solid items at a certain extent without breaking.When I got this saber for Christmas, my Dad couldn't put it down. He was IMPRESSED!!!!! I know what to get him for his birthday!"
5,"Impressive ""toy""","My hubby, a major Star Wars fanatic, has wanted one of these ever since he first learned they existed. I surprised him with one under the tree for Christmas and he has been extremely happy with it. I'm not a Star Wars kind of person, but I'll admit that it's a cool gadget. It's very similar to the light sabers from the movies with its sounds and visuals. And even though it explicitly states that it's not a toy, it's pretty durable in that it can easily take the gentle ""hits"" required to make its clashing sounds.This is a perfect item for a Star Wars fan!"
2,not even close,I'm a pro level competitor when wielding one and two handed weapons I can apprive many combinations of twirls and reverses and underswings and crossarms and overlays and not to say the least can front and back flip over a 6 foot person with a sense of great placment to strike a enemy with undernining abilities and when you can hone my powers and you feel like a jedi when you can sommersaualt and simmy like a ninja these sabers and got it I. Have the officail reasons as you read to be able to wield a real weopon of a true cutting and decappitating lightsaber where can you buy the real thing not annys real fake saber but the real medical slicing power fused saber with chrome steel melting abilities with cut 10 specks and a heated lazer with pressure giuded saber slicing heat at up to 1000 degrees for tru jedi battle I own fire arms and knives why not a real sabre
1,Beware of DOLLTV,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM OR ANY THING ELSE FROM DOLLTV. They sent a defective item and when I e-mailed them (the day I recieved it), they claimed it was my responsibility to send it to the manufacturarer for repair or replacement and to allow for 6 WEEKS. They told me I was ""lucky"" that is was under warranty. What joke! They made no offer to replace it or reimburse for shipping cost. There are similar reviews about this company on their feedback section. Do not buy anything from DOLLTV."

4,A must have,Everyone who lives along the NE Atlantic shoreline would find this book so very interesting in identifying the plants around your feet.
2,"Great Art, Poor Construction","I love the art of Edward Gorey and make a point to purchase a calendar or planner featuring his work each year. The Neglected Murderesses is a wonderful collection of Gorey's work.I have to say, however, that I am somewhat disappointed with the construction of this item. Within 3 weeks of daily usage, the plastic that protects the back cover fell off. A week or so later, the spiral binding started to come undone, so I have to be wary of jabbing myself on the sharp metallic edges. I have not had any problems like this with any other Gorey planners that I have used and am disappointed that this one seems unable to stand up to regular, everyday usage."
2,Oragnizer...TOO small,Its a great idea but its just too small. I wasted my money on this but oh well; live and learn.
2,A minipack of tissues nearly overfills it.,"This silly little thing isn't big enough to organize what'd go in my baby belly bag on a bike ride, much less what I'd need in a day trip. It won't hold ANY map I could buy from a filling station or a travel organizer. The flat parf of my Garmin would fall out of it as it went over the first bump on the road. Oh, it'll stay hung where you put it. However, it won't hold even half of what a SMALL compact car's glove compartment would hold. Oh well.I gave it to my next door neighbor's girl for her barbie's in-car stuff on their next weekend trip."
5,Action-packed tale of time travel,"""X-Men: Cable--Time Fugitive"" consists of a 2-part episode from the animated X-Men adventures. In this story the mutant superhero team gets caught in the conflict between Bishop and Cable, time travelers with their own agendas. The story opens in New York in the year 3999, during a fierce battle.This 2-parter is very violent and action-packed; lots of mayhem and explosions. The story overall is cleverly structured, and makes good use of the time travel theme. And while I didn't feel that the story attained the epic sweep which it could have had, it's definitely worthwhile for X-Men fans."
1,Not as good as I expected it to be,"Pros...-Sounds better than a FM transmitter ever will-Charges your IPod without the extra cables around, and free-ing my cigarrette lighter-No longer having to deal with the cup holder and all those extra accesoriesCons...-Slow interface with the IPod (it takes like a second or so to switch from artist to artist)-Only 8 characters for titles/artist, no scrolling-Once you switch the sort order from album to artist, it brings you back to first artist on your listCould this product be improved? absolutely! I'd like to see the ability to switch back and forth from artist/album without going all the way back to the first artist/album you have. Some scrolling on the titles/artists would be good too.Can I live with this product the way it is now? yea.. I guess that's what playlists are for, as long as I don't have to hear all the hiss and static from those FM transmitters anymore."
4,need help!!!,"ok so here goes, if anyone can help me i would appreciate it very much. I have a pioneer deck tv (5700) and it is compatible with this ipod connector. so i got the connector, read the directions for a hook up (seemed easy enough) and when i got my deck out i realized the cable that connects the headunit to the adapter is the same cable that connects my sirius satellite radio to my deck and there is only one of these connections on the deck. so how can i possible hook up both the ipod adapter and my sirius at the same time. is there some kind of splitter the douchbags at circuitcity failed to tell me about?"
2,"Product does not deliver, Lacks song / title information","Hello, I just got this unit installed today on my Pioneer AVIC-N1. Product does not display full song and title information. I don't even know how much time is left on each song....I mean its cool I don't have to burn CD's anymore, but as a lot of other people are saying, Pioneer can improve this product. Bottom line, if you just want something to have on a long road trip..this is it, as far as having the same functions you have on your ipod...its not there."
1,Total piece of junk,"This thing is even worse than Alpine's effort!!!You can't see the name of the song, artist (unless the song pits in 8 chars). No pause I can find, the controls are completely lame and there is no way to search for songs that are useful in ANY way. No logical support for seeing genres in a list, nor playlists. Awful!I bought a new car, AVIC-D1 and this piece of junk. Thinking of sending everything with the name pioneer on it back because it just plain stinks.What a complete and total ripoff.Pioneer, what a stupid name for a company that produces junk like this."
3,Re: Navigation Trick,"For about 2-3 weeks the ""Navigation Trick"" discussed worked perfectly for me. For some reason, w/in the last week or so it has all together stopped working. Nothing has changed between then & now except for possibly a recent iPod software update (?) I'm wondering if this recent update may have caused this ""trick"" to stop working. Anyways, just wondering if anyone has exeperienced the same scenario. ThanksRick"
4,"Very good, needs polishing","A lot has been written about this device. I connected it to my DEH-8600MP and use an iPod Nano. Set-up was very simple, instructions were clear.Depending upon how you use your ipod, this interface will either be wonderful or a complete pain. If you choose to browse by artist or album, and choose particular tracks at will, you will find this virtually unusable. If, however, you are like me (and most other iPod users, I imagine) and play either pre-made playlists or simply play a random shuffle, you will have no problems. Indeed, the sound quality with this interface is outstanding! Reason enough to use this over any FM-based system.By the way, I tried repeatedly to use the 'trick' described in other reviews posted here to enable the iPod controls to become functional. No dice. I have no idea why this didn't work for me... But again, no problem if you use your iPod as I do."
3,"it works, but that's about it","I hooked up my unit to a DEH-P4700MP and everything works fine. I don't use playlists on my ipod, so once I set the headunit for random, the only buttons I use are for next song and previous song. And they work great. I've learned to live without fastforward and reverse.I don't know if it's the headunit or the ipod controller, but I agree with everyone else about the controls being terrible.I read the manual for the kenwood ipod controller, and those controls seem more user-friendly. So, if you're buying a headunit and an ipod controller, look into kenwood, too."
5,Beautiful Sounds!,"I have had these for a while now and love them! My sister suggested I get them based on her having a set. Looked them up in Amazon and was able to hear the actual sounds that the different sizes make. Selected this one and ordered it. As a Prime member, shipping was free and fast and I put it up that weekend. You will need something substantial to hang it from. I built a frame from pipe [top rails of chain link fence]. Sounds are beautiful and so relaxing! The sounds online are very indicative of what you will actually hear! The chimes themselves are well built with quality throughout. I expect them to last many years without having to restring. The basic component should last forever. Really a great item."
3,Not as good as the original.,"After reading Deaver's first book in the twisted series, I was very excited to recieve this book. I was quite let down by this one. In the first book I could not figure out what the twist was going to be. The stories in More Twisted were predictable and I think deaver lost a little of his touch. They were not boring stories, they just lacked the element of surprise. The best story in this book was Born Bad, it had the element os suspense, and kept you guessing right up until the end and BAM!!! You are blown away by the surprise. But that is just my opinion. The first book was so much better."
3,Manufactured twists in most cases. Average leisure read.,"I picked this up as a leisure read, and because I wanted something I could chew up piecemeal. I gave it the three stars I did mostly because I was able to do just that: read a story or two a day, and not worry about remembering anything beyond that.But make no mistake, it wasn't great. Yes, there were twists at the end of each short story (the basic premise of the book). However, in almost every case, the twist wasn't something that was carefully planted, something the reader could have picked up on, or at least said, ""Of course. It was there all along."" In each case, the twist wasn't ludicrous; it just wasn't carefully cultivated and nurtured through the story.And ultimately, I believe that's what we all want... twists that not only surprise us, but that make us think, ""It couldn't have been any other way."" So lots of promise, but very lacking in the delivery."
2,"UH - not nearly as good as ""Twisted""","I'm a huge fan of Deaver's non-Lincoln Rymes writings. I loved ""Twisted"" as each short story I eagerly took in every word to figure what the twist was that I was reading. I am a reader that ""always figures it out"" too soon in books. ""Twisted"" kept me captivated. I was so anxious to read ""More Twisted"" but was utterly and sadly disappointed. NONE of the stories were written with the same verve as those found in ""Twisted"". Dull would be a closer description of the ending of most of the stories in ""More Twisted"". I am hoping the next book of short stories by Deaver will be as good as ""Twisted"" - but just like movies, book sequels are never as good as the first."
2,Avoid.,"Disappointing. The description on Amazon says 16 pages. I wondered how they fit the libretto into 16. They didn't. Just 6 schmaltzy tunes. Avoid this slim, slim, slim (e.g. partial lyrics for the 6 tunes that are included) offering.Proper title is: ""Selections from the Production Oklahoma!""Which would be a hint, eh?"
5,Get to know Mises,"Here is a very nice exposition of the basic work of Mises and a look at his life. Mises is a man you want to know about, a towering intellect. His life work will live forever. It is available now for our benefit. Read him and think. No apologies for capitalism will be found here."
2,Heroes meet soap opera&#65533;Soap Opera wins!,"A ""normal"" woman marries into the Noble family, the world's most famous family of superheroes and complications ensue. Jay Faerber works in all the soap opera conceits, the cheating spouses, surprise pregnancies, murderous family members, and even that old SF stand by, the brain transplant. While Faerber's stated goal is to take a different look at the genre, he really only succeeds in transferring it to the realm of daytime dramas. With art by group of raw talents, NOBLE CAUSES is not so much different as it is derivative."
5,A Standout in a Growing Crowd,"Walk into a bookstore and you can be overwhelmed with the HEALTH information thrown at you . . . particularly if you are interested in understanding how you can play a more active role in your own prevention, treatment and cure of disease. The Natural Pharmacy gives you just the right balance of useful information without insulting your intelligence or burying you in biochemistry. The book is organized around health concerns - in English, not medical-ese, the authors provide you with dietary & lifestyle changes that maybe helpful before they tell you about other approaches - including nutritional supplements and herbs. They cover side effects and interactions as well. They also provide a tremendous resource for insomniacs by listing more than 3,500 references! You can also look up specific nutritional supplements, herbs and homeopathic remedies as well. A nicely done work!"
1,Pig in a Poke,"""American Experience"" -- great educational television. But do I already own this one? I don't have them all: is it something I might be interesting in? Is it recollections of World War II veterans? Or what it was like photographing the dead of the Civil War? Or how the west was won? Or 19th century fashions? Or building bridges? Can anybody solve the mystery? Though I have inquired about this several times there has been no response. If you cannot give us a picture of the package front, please include a three word summary...."
4,"Skechers Women's Ice Queen Mid Sneaker Bootie, Black, 7.5 M","Super saver shipping is a charming option I think, if you don't have to hurry. Boots are OK. They are lite and keeps warm :)Fotos were useful for your selection."
3,Pretty but too big for me,"I like the bracelet, but it's too wide for me and keeps coming undone. Plus the heart is so heavy it kept banging on everything and was inconvenient...in the end I took it off and wear it as a pendant. So generally nice, but probably better suited for someone else."
1,Sad,Very disappointed it took 4 days to receive my email that the item is out of stock. I would not recommend this dealer. The item should never have been listed for sale and/or I should have been notified in less than 24 hours if it was unavailable.
1,gold wears off VERY quickly,Bought this bracelet as a xmas gift for my daughter. The gold tone was visibly wearing within the first 2 days she owned the product. She did not shower or sleep with the bracelet. After one week the bracelet looked horrible and my daughter no longer wears it. No response from seller.
4,"Cute, but you get what you pay for","It is really cute, a little on the small (and heavy!) side. After a day of normal wear, i did notice the silver tones underneath. I would not wear this as your every day jewelry. As an above review said, I would save up for the silver stuff. Maybe its supposed to look antiqued, who knows..."
2,nice weight cheap finish,Don't pay for this. Looks good for the first wear and then changes. I even stored mine in the box in my vault with my really expensive jewellery. Sorry I did because it started to strip after only one wear :-(...total waste of my $138
5,An informative history of the unsung Uhu 219,"As an amateur German 'cool hardware' junky I found this book to be precisely what I was looking for. Despite admissions of inadequacy by the author, what is within the book is certainly enough to give the reader a solid appreciation of both the history and the capabilities of this aircraft.The Uhu was one of the best twin-engine fighter/interceptors in the air during its operational lifetime, and most people have never heard of it.Full of photos, tech-accurate professional paintings, diagrams, and knowledgeable exposition. Top-notch job."
3,kinda disappointing,"This turned out to be a bunch of loose pieces. Not sure if it's from a set or how complete it is (I didn't receive the binoculars pictured and some of it looks like it should be part of a bigger piece of equipment). Although the pack is cool, the rest is so-so. Recommend picking up the G.I. Joe Navy Special Ops figure instead."
1,Defective product,"I owned an older version of this product with a white shower attachment and better spray head design. The one I ordered had a fake metal shower attachment. The hose would NOT lock into the shower attachment and kept popping off and flooding the bathroom floor. Since I owned a previous version of the product I know how to attach and detach it and the new version of the product is defective. Not only that, but I do not like the redesigned shower head it's hard to latch and unlatch. The previous shower head was much better. I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it. The problem is that there does not seem to be many alternatives on the market."
4,Pet Washer,"Good Value for the money, easy to install and use. I would pay a little more for some kind of a clip holder for the head."
3,Mojovision is not one of my favorite X-Men episodes,"Mojovision is almost too silly for my taste. I think the premise is interesting, but Mojo's character was too absurd to take seriously. Anyway, Mojo is from another dimension and kidnaps the X-Men while they're shopping for a new T.V. set because Jubilee destroyed the last one (if my memory serves me correctly). Mojo puts them in his TV show where the X-Men have to try to stay alive in these simulations (episodes, if you will) that he puts them in. All hope seems lost as the different simulations/episodes pick off the X-Men one by one..."
3,Makes the game a little complicated.,"Maybe these cards would make the game more fun for players who are totally familiar with the standard deck. For me, they make the game a little too complicated. Good analogy is the expansion pack for Catan."
1,Doesn't work properly,"I hooked it up to my xbox 360 and I was excited that it initially seemed to work. However, once i actually started playing games on it then it would constantly randomly blanking out and no picture was shown on the TV. It's a piece of junk, don't even bother with it."
3,It works,"The switch works exactly as promised with no degradition in signal quality. The problem is with the remote, it has very little range. I am controling it with my logitech universal and this is the only component that does not switch sometimes. Event the remote that is supplied worked intermittently."
1,Does not convert optical audio to digital output,"Bought it to hook up XBox 360 (first generation) and Nintendo Wii to HDMI using a 1080p HD Component Video + Coaxial/Optical Toslink Digital Audio to HDMI Converter (100~240V AC)(Available on Amazon). Used component outputs from XBox 360 and Wii as inputs 1 & 2 on this box. Then used component video + optical audio output to the HDMI converter. It degraded the picture quality for XBox 360 to 480p and no sound. The 2-page pamphlet included with this item lists only optical audio from input is transmitted to optical output and the box does not perform any conversion. When I hook up the XBox 360 to HDMI converter directly, it generates 1080p output plus excellent audio on TV. Returned this item next day and found Neoya.com has an HDMI converter for Wii as well. No need to put this useless component switch in the middle. Remote is very small and has only 3 buttons to switch. It is small and low quality as well."
3,"good, but be careful re mixing digital and analog","If you have a mix of analog and digital audio, this unit doesn't help. fir instance, I bought the unit to solve the following issue. I wanted to route the following audio sources into my iPod HiFi speaker:1. optical from my dvd player2. analog from my tv player (it has no optical out)3. optical from my airport expressThe Apple HiFi has one input that is of the type that will take either an optical or analog input (but not both at the same time).So, because the Impact Switcher doesn't convert audio from digital to analog (or vice versa), you must match the output from the Impact unit to your speaker or it won't work.so, for me - because my idiotic, not that old TV has no optical out - it means that in order to get sound out of it, I have to degrade all of my signals in order to run the TV through the Impact and into the Apple Hi Fi. In other words, my dvd player and airport express have to send analog signals to the Impact.frustrating."
3,Works Well but...,"This product does what it's supposed to do. It remoetly switches optical outputs so you can have multiple devices that use optical sound. I love being able to do this remotely with my universal remote. One flaw is that it doesn't always respond to IR commands and it doesn't always respond to even physically pressing the power button or the channel buttons. This doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes I have to press the power button like 10 times (alternating between just pressing it and pressing and holding it) before it turns on.If you want something that remotely controls your optical inputs and don't mind the device being unresponsive sometimes, then get this product."
5,Works effectively - good product,"I purchased this switch because I had too many optical sources and only one optical input on my home theater receiver. I had previously tried a Toslink optical splitter, which worked for about five minutes, if that. I purchased this switch and it works brilliantly. Previous reviewers have said the IR receiver has a hard time picking up the signal from the remote, but I have had no issues with that, however, I am using a Logitech Harmony One remote. There is no lag whatsoever in the audio; it is perfectly in sync with the video.The bottom line is, if you have more optical sources than inputs, this switch should work for you."
1,shoulda woulda....,"Instead of upgrading my aging Sony home theater receiver to one that has built in component/HDMI monitor outputs with upconversion, I decided to give this a shot. Worked well for a little over 3 months. Now all scenes are missing the red coloring. I have a pretty straight forward setup consisting of a BenQ 1080i DLP projector which is used as my ""Monitor"". This is connected to the output of my component video switch, with LG DVD player and DirectTV as source inputs. I'm certain it is not a cable, projector, nor a dvd issue as I have no issues when bypassing the switch and directly connecting the projector to the source.I've also tried swapping out cables. For those of you debating whether to upgrade your existing home theater receiver or just upgrade to a component video switch, I would pass on this product and invest in a real home theater receiver. I will try and get a replacement... If their support follows through I will change my rating."
1,Extremely glitchy,"Right out of the box the system seemed to work fine, but once I started plugging more components in it became glitchy. The response time is very slow for high frequency signals, so any time there are bright flashes the screen blinks (like in video games). Also, I am unable to change between devices plugged into the box while the TV is set to the box's input (ie if I have a DVD player plugged into channel 1 and a Wii plugged into channel 2 on the box, and the box plugged into AV3 on the TV, I have to have the TV set to AV1 or AV2 to change between my DVD and Wii on the box). I am very frustrated with this purchase."
3,Buyer Beware,"If you are looking to use this as a component switch, look elsewhere! The picture on your TV goes totally black anytime the scene on TV changes from a very dark scene to a bright scene. The picture comes back, but this makes watching movies very frustrating. The audio however, works perfectly. I am using this item to switch between four RCA audio inputs and it works perfectly."
3,Image Degradation Visible,"I took a chance on this unit with all the great reviews I'd read, however I found that this product does not live up to the hype. When running a component video source (Xbox 360) through this device I noticed a decrease in image clarity, specifically, the image looked out of focus. It could be that the 100"" image I'm throwing from my projector amplifies the imperfections caused from this switch. I was greeted with a crystal clear image once I reverted back to my original setup of plugging the Xbox 360 directly into my A/V receiver. For smaller TVs this may be an OK unit but I suggest a pass if you have a large TV or projector."
3,Average Performance,"I bought this switch in the hopes that is would outperform a switch that I bought at Wal-Mart for less. I was disappointed in its performance. I was hoping that it would prevent major signal loss when switching from component to component. One component that WAS connected to this switch was our Nintendo Wii. There was so much signal loss due to this switch that I removed the Wii from the switch and connected it directly to the television because the console was unplayable.Overall it is not a bad switch (the Wii was the only component to exhibit signal loss). Never the less, I was disappointed in the switch's performance due to the signal loss of the Wii and the high regard with which other respondents held it."
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to,"No need to ramble on about this. Bought this about 2 months ago and it's been doing just fine keeping all my devices hooked up. I have a DVD player, Verizon cable box and PS2 all hooked up via component cables with no signal degradation on my 27"" TV. The optical audio outs are a nice feature, as is the remote. For adding some extra (quality) component inputs, this is a wise investment for the price."
2,Audio problem,The video works great but the first audio input would cut out pretty frequently. I tried different fiber optic cables and got the same results. The second audio input worked fine. The fiber optic connections seemed quite a bit looser than my stereo receiver. Not sure if that's what caused the problem though. I am sending it back.
2,Remote control and optical audo plusess don't outweight frequent resync issues,"I experienced the same problem with this device as reviewed by others. Sudden changes in the brightness of onscreen material causes a resync. My setup is a PS3, HD DVR & XBOX 360 running into this switch, then a Yamaha Amp/Receiver to a Sony XBR TV. Every time a grenade exploded on an xbox game or any affect that caused a bright flash. The HD DVR experienced a similiar issue with sudden screen brightness changes or switching between an HD program and the guide. This is particularly frustrating when playing online games. The screen would suddenly resync to black and back to the displayed material in the middle of fights or major cinematic events. I guess there's a reason why it was only $40. I will be returning it."
5,Works as promised,"Plugged it in to use with our Wii and our region-free DVD player. It works just like it should with no problems, and it's the cheapest one I've found. The little remote control is handy to switch back and forth, and the device itself isn't overly huge so it sits well on top of our DVD player.No cons!Don't forget to buy an extra component cable with this like I did!"
3,Componet switcher,"The device seems to work fine but it did not do what I needed. I basically had one good input left on my first generation HDTV. My idea was to plug everything thru this switcher then to my last good input. Problem was the tv still would not play my SD sources without losing the picture lock. Turns out it is a down convert problem with my tv. So again this switcher works, it just doesn't do magic."
1,Flawless.,First: A rubber leg was missing from the bottom of the unit. Second: There is a LOUD crack (snap) when switching imputs.UPDATE; Snapping was from a cheap receiver. Bought an Onkyo receiver and all the problems stopped! Switching and fiber optics are perfect. I purchased the 3-Play and the cheap surround system at the same time and didn't realize how cheap the system was. I actually bought another 3-Play for my main system a month later. It solved all my connection woes.
4,Works as intended,"If you are suck with more input devices than your TV can take, this is a decent solution. The one bad thing about this product was revealed when disconnecting component cables.. the metal sleeves on the RCA jacks slid off with the cable. It was easily remedied.. but speaks to the lack of build quality in what is an inexpensive product. This doe snot change the functionality of the device."
3,You get what you pay for,"I have purchased this hardware to solve the cable problem after upgrading to a new projector. While I don't have to change plugs anymore, I now have a new problem, which is that everytime there's a certain noise in a movie or game (Xbox 360) I get a blue screen for about 3 seconds. This is especially annoying when playing certain games where I cannot see what's going on in the middle of an intense fight due to the screen turning blue for a few seconds. I have noticed that it happens which high pitches noises, clicking noises or swishing noises. I have upgraded to high-end cables but that didn't solve the problem. I wonder how this can be avoided? Is the hardware faulty?"
1,Good... if it works,Well this just sucks. Bought this in February and it's not the middle of June and the output for the blue has died. I haven't even used the darn thing all that much at all and always keep the power off when not in use. Completely disappointed and now I have to deal with trying to replace it. Last time I ever buy something from that manufacturer again. Not even 4 months and it breaks? Pathetic.
2,Not full composite connections,"Very nice equipment and quick delivery but required digital input and so would not work properly. Be very careful about your connectons to input devices, e.g. VCR, DVD, cable, etc."
5,Perfect!,"I was skeptical because of the low price, but this is PERFECT.No signal loss, does EXACTLY what it claims to.Perfect if using a slightly older tv with only 1 component input like mine :)(I am even using really cheap cables and there is STILL no signal loss)Remote works great as well!!Great deal, don't pass it up!!!!"
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"Having an older HDTV, it lacks many of the nice extras newer models have(like extra component connections), so the Impact Acoustics A/V selector is exactly what I needed. Easy to hook-up and use. I'm so glad that I purchased it."
1,Died two weeks after the warranty expired,"This worked great until two weeks after the one-year warranty expired. Then it started, intermittently, suppressing the blue video. A couple of months after that, it started cutting out the video altogether. It seems to be an issue with overheating, as it works for the first hour or so, then begins to cut out after that. It is now unusable (18 months after the purchase,) and we'll have to buy another (and different) one."
2,Problems using this with Wii and Xbox 360...,"I bought this switcher because of the high review scores but I've had two of them not work for me and ultimately had to send them both back and get a refund. When running the Nintendo Wii through it I would often get sync loss and flickering anytime a bright white screen came on (which happened a lot in Super Mario Galaxy).Additionally, while running my XBOX 360 though it, the screen would often scramble and freeze up (confirmed this was not the 360 itself). FYI, my Wii is set to 480p and the 360 at 720p which this switcher could supposedly handle. Unfortunately that was not the case for me. Was it just bad luck? Who knows, but I'll have to look for another brand now."
5,Performs like a champ out of the box!,"This device, allows me to input 3 component cables and then pass to my tvs 1 component input. Just what the doctor ordered as I currently have my xbox and DVD player hooked up, where I had to use S video for the xbox in the past. It is a solidly built, apparently well designed unit that also lets you hook up the 3 inputs with your choice of regular or digital audio (toslink). This allows a big improvement in connectivity without buying a new receiver or tv."
5,Great product,"I use this switch with an Xbox 360, and can't detect any signal loss. I have a Panasonic 50-inch plasma connected to a high-definition cable box using 30-feet of high-quality component video cable. I recently got an XBox 360, which required sharing the 30-feet of component video cable between the cable box and the XBox. I don't use the a/v selector to switch audio signals, only video. There is no detectable distortion or signal loss using this switch, with either the Xbox or high-definition cable. The switch is extremely easy to set up. I've configured my universal remote to control the a/v selector, which is hidden away in a closet with the rest of my equipment and controlled via a remote control IR extender unit. The a/v selector is pretty far away from the remote control extender (both are inside the closet), but it still picks up the IR signal. I don't know how they can make this thing for so little money. It works great!"
5,Works exactly as advertised.,I have been using this switcher for a couple weeks now and it has worked perfectly. Very easy to install and it can be programmed into my harmony 880 with no problems.
3,Optical Issues,"1st I bought a refurbished unit and the optical output was physically gone from the unit so I returned it to Amazon (FYI: the video switched properly and looked good). Next, I purchased a full priced unit but I couldn't get any optical output to be recognized by my Denon AVR. I could hold the input and output optical cables together and see things work, but no luck through this switcher. Once again my 1080i video and analog audio switched properly & nicely. It's simple to use/hookup, but I can't speak highly for their build quality."
5,perfect!,"Excellent item, exactly as advertised. I am not using this for video, i only needed more optical audio inputs, and currently i am using 2 of the inputs with no problems at all.i almost opted for a cheaper alternative with one of the ""turn dial"" splitters, but honestly, i paid a little more than twice the price for one of those for this item, and i'm glad i did. this is much more durable and actually designed to do what i need it to do."
5,nice for a price,"Had no problem to connect DVD & WII to kids computer monitor (using as TV). Working great, great picture quality, great sound."
4,"costly, but well made and effective","This is a great unit to merge all other devices to your HDTV, gold plated connectors and remote control will have your switching from one device to the other without any issues."
4,started out good then declined,"i havent taken the time to finish the game yet (finals are coming up)so some of what i say might not be accurate for the entire game.in the begining of the game it was really fun. it had some good shooting and was a lot like half life except scary. until you play the game you cant understand how it can be actually scary, but believe me it it, in some parts. the slow motion during the fighing is really cool. this game has really good AI for its age. it was a good game but it got worse maybe the ending of it will make it better."
3,Great creepy shooter,"The creepiness of this game wears off halfway through so that the ""chills"" are pretty much ignored. At the start of the game there are plenty of things going bump in the night, but by midway it seems even the developers got tired of it and the spooky sights and sounds of random objects moving on their own trickle off.The controls are sweet and the leveling up is consistent, however more could have been done with the fear meter. Smart AI and great graphics make this an addicting game, though its story is not terribly engrossing."
1,most overrated modern game there is,"i've seen a LOT of overrated games, but this one amazed even me.take max payne. remember how it was really hard without bullet time? ok. take away most of the bullet time, turn it into an FPS where you die every time you run out of bullet time (oh, excuse me, ""slow-mo due to your guy's amazing reflexes""), include a bunch of super-standard guns and environments, and voila, a highly rated, great-selling game.why do people love it? one word: GRAPHICS. yeah, those bullets look so amazing whizzing by you in slow-mo... who cares? looks don't make a great game. gameplay does."
2,"Not Scary, Too Linear, Stale Environrment","I found this to be just another ordinary shooter. Its thin plot didn't scare me at all (see such classics as Clive Barker's Undying and System Shock 2 if you want a truly scary shooter). There are a few NPCs (Non Playable Characters) that try to move the plot along but your time with them is way too brief for you to care what happens to them next. Your progress through the environments in extremely linear which is exacerbated by the fact the environments are ALL buildings. The whole game takes place in a collection of office buildings and warehouses where you'll fight in close quarters surrounded by the mandatory collection of boxes, crates, and pipes. I admit that the enemy AI is very good and the graphics are impressive but they weren't enough to save me from boredom after only a few hours. Overall, a big dissapointment."
3,Over Rated,"This game is so Over Rated...If these people really wanted you to play this game,you would'nt need all the so called ""requirements"" to play it.I just dont think it's as good as DOOM 3.Now I know why they called it FEAR.It's the FEAR your computer gets when you download it.I've played it on my Comp.It works fine except when I try to move left to right to shoot.Then it hesitates once in awhile,Never had any problems with any other Shooter Games til this one.But the discs do make good coasters.Anyway it's not all that special.Lots of other shooters that are better games(that allow you to play)so go that route."
5,Great so far,I am in the midst of playing this game. The only tacky event is that Mapes is still alive. I thought he died at the vault.
5,One of the best FPS experiences out there!,"My take on FPS games is that for the most part, they are all the same. The difference really comes from the gelling of the experience, combat, and AI. If you manage to forget for a moment that you're playing a game, and really ""get into"" the game without being reminded by a programmer's stupidity that you are playing a game, then the job has been well done. F.E.A.R. accomplished that for me. I definitely had the sensation of being ""in the game"", and lame as it sounds, had goosebumps numerous times. I was startled several times, wasted rounds at noises, and could hardly stop playing until I was done.High points were:Enemy AI was some of the best I've ever seen - a real revolution.Storyline was intense, involving, and enjoyable.There was a good mix of shooting environments, and good weapons to take advantage of the different environments.Overall an outstanding experience. Much better than DOOM 3. Better than Far Cry in some ways."
4,Looks awesome at medium resolution,"I have a really lousy (GeForce 6600GT 128MB) graphic card.but at the medium resolution,which the game hardware detectionadviced me to run, it doesn't slow down below 75 fps,and it looks just awesome.You don't have to buy a top notch graphic card to play this game.I'm wandering,though how this game will look on video cards like6800GT or 6800 Ultra.Wish i could afford one of these.I gave this game 4 stars,because the environment is not as good as in Half Life 2.Endless maze of coridoors.But all the weapons,shooting and fighting simply the best i've ever seen."
2,Lousy Story,"I thought the gameplay was great, but the story was awful. Play Half-Life 2 for five minutes and you quickly have an interest in the story and the characters, but after finishing this game I didn't care at all what happened to the story or the characters. I thought when they brought in some npc's that they would start to develop those things, but I was to be disappointed. The environments aren't anything interesting either.If you don't care anything about having a good story and are only interested in a decent fps, then go ahead and try this. Otherwise, skip it."
5,Great first person shooter,I played it to the end four times and want to keep it. It gets more exciting the more the game goes.
1,F.E.A.R. is a real P.I.A. to install but fun to play!,"Although this game is fun to play, it is a nightmare to install. My husband spent several weekends trying to get the game to install and play without crashing even though we more than exceeded the minimum requirements. After countless hours with tech support and on gaming forums, after my husband pulled what was left of his hair out (just kidding) and cursed and threatened and verbally abused the game and it's developers (not kidding) F.E.A.R. is finally up and running.Once installed, the game is a really fun - but linear - FPS. With headphones on and the lights out, some parts are really creapy (in a good way)."
3,Fun but bloody and vulgar,"It's a fun game, but the violence is quite gratuitous, and there is far too much swearing. It's entirely unnecessary to hear the worst swears in the English language every other time you start shooting at an enemy. Also, the ending requires you to kill a helpless, unarmed person. Even if he has done evil things, there should be another option to continue the game other than shooting or hitting someone who is not offering resistance.Basically, it's fun, but check your moral compass."
4,Scary,The game is cool as far as the graphics and special effects. However the controls feel a little awkward when you try to maneuver. The story line and cinematics are great -though I have not finished the game yet.Multiplayer feels like CounterStrike.Be prepared: this game has scared the c[...] out of me to the point I have to play it during the day.
4,Dark but fun,I have enjoyed this game very much. The only problem I have had is it is so dark even with the flashlight on it can be very difficult to see. I don't understand why the flashlight has such a short period to stay lit I think they needed to go shopping at Home Depot before going on the mission and getting a flashlight that would stay lit a little longer.Overall a fun game.
3,Mediocre,"Not sure why everyone made so much fuss over this game. It was kind of predictable and boring at times. It's basically like all the other military type of games, run around in a city, shooting other soldiers, and occasionally you get some weird acid flashback thing going on. Then at the end you shoot a scrawny naked crack whore and fly away in a helicopter.whoopeee......"
2,May be it is a good game if you had a high end video card,"Warning! If you can play Battlefield 2 in highest resolution doesn't mean your video card can support this game. I have a Geforce FX 5600 ultra and played BF2 in highest resolution, Half-life 2 in highest resolution and setting but only can play FEAR in 620x600 resolution ? radiculus and unbelievable. Why? don't ask me Ask Sierra. BE..BE.. BE.. CAREFUL and check your video card before buying this game"
2,Nothing New Here,"I am frustrated with this game because the graphics leave a lot to be desired. I was expecting a whole lot more based on all the hype. I have a Radeon x850 XT Platinum Edition video card with all the graphic setting maxed out, and this game still doesn't compete with Far Cry, Chronicles of Riddick, HL2, or Doom3. And you often feel like a rat in a cage, as there is no place to go except exactly where the game has mapped out your next objective. I have been waiting on this game for months, and am extremely dissapointed."
3,OK but WAY OVERRATED and its NOT perfect by any means.,"The game starts off great. It truly is an on the edge of your seat experience but by the time you reach the middle, you're left wishing for some more wide open areas to manuever around in. A couple of times I had to take a break from the game because the levels were getting extremely disorienting for me.I wish game developers would STOP making games with this kind of repetitive shooting as well as so few different enemy types, it gets boring real fast when there's no character interaction or scary moments.The multiplayer is absolutely horrible. Its too easy to get killed and in order to get anywhere with it, its basically FORCES you to play for hours on end if you want to improve. As an adult gamer with time constraints, the multiplayer game is designed for the hardcore gamer and not for players like me.In closing, my recommendation is to wait until the price goes down before you get it. Its fun but it doesn't offer enough for the cost."
3,Too short,"First of all, two words: too short! I did not rush through this game, like I normally do, and it only took me eleven hours to finish it - that's a terrible length for a First Person Shooter. The actual game is great! The lights, sounds, graphics are amazing, if you have good enough hardware, and the story is gripping, but it is way too short.The story unfolds gradually, and then at the end, you're hit with a massive amount of background and the game ends. It has your attention, now they should have used it to their advantage instead of just ending the game. Being used to spending 25+ hours on a game, like in Half-Life 1&2 or DOOM3, it was rather disappointing.I highly recommend the game, but don't expect it to be a nice, long, convoluted story."
1,Not up to snuff,"As a rabid First Person Shooter player I was a little dissapointed in this game. The main problems I had was the sluggish movement controls (as compared to other FPS games) and quite frankly, the weird story line which, I hasten to add, may be attractive to some people."
1,Would Not Know!!!,"Unfortunately I can't review this game because I never received it from the company I ordered it from. The company was THE BOOKGROVE. I ordered this game on January 15, 2010 and it's now February 20, 2010, and still no game. I will never order from that company again!!!Unsatisfied Customer"
1,It's not what you're thinking,"This game is so popular only because of advertisement. Just think about these facts: the single player is so short that it take no longer than 4 hours, and the story is extremely stupid, especially the ending when there is nuclear explosion, and our hero flyes out of there on helecopter!!!The multiplayer is one of the worst FPS multiplayers. Coupal weapons, similar maps, same skins and few stupid mods.The ONLY thing about this game is its graphics, but they ain't looking SO good, it just will be VERY laggy, unless you have the BEST video card.+It is secured by securom, which means if you have ANY cd-emulators installed, this game WILL NOT WORK.Will say something like ""security modul cannot be activated"". If you ever had this problem with any games, you definitely will have it here."
4,I FEAR the bad language but LOVE the game!,"You should FEAR not having this game! This is the best FPS I've played in YEARS. The game had a good length, not too short or long. Can't wait for more. This game goes WAY overboard on the bad language. I found a hack to cut out most of the cursing (google it) and that made it better. I'm all for throwing it in as an accent to the action, but they go too far and it does nothing for the story. minus 1 star for language"
2,"stale, generic FPS wrapped in a nice engine","If you like seeing what they're doing with game graphics, go ahead and play this. You'll be very impressed for a few minutes.The rest of your time will be split between 2 things:1) walking through warehouse after warehouse filled with cardboard boxes and crates. i'm not kidding. crates. this game mechanic was stale over a decade ago.2) watching predictably placed cutscenes where a character lifted straight from the ring ""terrorizes you"". this is in quotes because it's really not suspenseful or scary, seemingly there to give the game an illusion of plot.so if you enjoy walking through crate filled warehouses, killing the same enemies repeatedly, then down a long hallway where you know a cutscene is coming, then watching the cutscene unfold in a faux-jhorror way... more power to you, buy this game.I don't, and therefore I couldn't even get past 2 hours before I had no interest in ever playing this again."
4,Outstanding game -- big time hardware requirements,"I just finished this game last week. This game is one of the best fps games I've played. I don't want to compare it to HL2 because they are equally great and a bit different. The storyline in FEAR is outstanding. Rarely does a fps game make the hair on the back of my neck stand up and give me chills, but this one did.I gave the game 4 stars overall because it can't be played in it's full glory on most computers. I played the game on an Athlon 64 3000+, 1GB RAM, and a Radeon 9800 PRO 128 MB video card. I kept having to tone down the resolution and detail. I was able to get through the game at 800x600 with low detail, but still had some lock-ups. I would like to see it on a Radeon x850.Overall, great game. Definately not for kids. Worth the hardware headaches."
2,"Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Gel, 4 Ounce",The Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Gel istoo strong for my rash skin. It swell up my left feet.I don't like it that much.Takako Masuda
1,Doesn't work,"This is worthless. I bought it because I thought I would get more for my money but I guess you get what you pay for. I've always used the Itch Relief stick from Benadryl for mosquito bytes and it has always worked in matter of seconds. This product doesn't work, no matter how much you put on or how long you wait. Get the Benadryl Itch Relief Stick Extra Strength.You can find that one here: http://www.amazon.com/Benadryl-Itch-Relief-Stick-14/dp/B0009XAHR4"
5,Strong and durable!,The best bungee I've ever used! VERY strong and durable. You could strap an elephant to the back of a dump truck with these things...and I have!
4,Good reading,"Great author and interesting stories. There is a lot of overlap between this book and ""Young Faces of Holiness"" by Ann Ball. I prefer Ball's book which is a little more exciting and gives more bang for the buck, but Cruz's book is a very good read too."
5,Good movie,"I love Rogue. This movie is a realy good movie for anyone wondering how Rogue got her Super Strenghth and Flying Ability. I'm not telling. The second movie is not as good, but it's ok. Instead of being about, Rogue, it's about Beast."
3,"Disappointing, but perhaps useful for some.","Somehow, this compilation of pieces of Lewis' works manages to dull his sparkling humor and make his words come across as heavy-handed. Strongly suggest reading the original works instead to get the full effect of Lewis' brilliance and light-heartedness. Part of the great thrill of reading his works is to see the long connections of thoughts and conclusions, which cannot be accomplished in little bites. Some people may find the edited daily snippets to be useful, but others may find it takes away too much of the author's wonderful spirit."
1,Not safe,"These collars do not break away. This means that the cat can easily get caught and choke, not a good thing. I did not realize this when I purchased some of them. Calling them ""safety"" callars is not a wise thing. I can't use them. At least they weren't expensive. . ."
2,A disappointment,"The Buffalo Bills are arguably the best barbershop quartet of all time. Unfortunately, this CD does not offer much to support the above assertion. Because it is less than a half hour in length and of mediocre sound quality, ""Barbershop Harmony Time"" does not do justice to the impressive sounds of either the Buffalo Bills or the Chordettes. For better performances from the Buffalo Bills, you may want to consider the soundtrack from the 1962 version of ""The Music Man"". For better performances from the Chordettes, you should definitely check out their ""25 All-Time Greatest Recordings""."
4,Great Collection of Two Giants in the Genre,"I recently discovered how much I liked barbershop music and decided to add some barbershop CD to my collection. One of the first names I had recommended to me was the Buffalo Bills. So I got this CD featuring them and The Chordettes.From what I know of barbershop, this contains several standards of the genre. Unfortunately, I didn't like the version of ""Down by the Old Mill Stream"" presented here.The other tracks are wonderful, however ranging from the upbeat ""Angry"" to the slower ""I Believe."" The Buffalo Bills are joined by instruments on ""If I could be with You One Hour Tonight"" and ""Fit as a Fiddle."" And I love their rendition of ""As Time Goes By.""The other drawback to this CD is that it's only 24 minutes long. As a result, it's quite easy to wear it out after a few listens. Still, it was money well spent and a good introduction to two giants in the barbershop genre from days gone by."
3,Good solid flick,[...]I bought this DVD because Richard Norton is in it. I enjoy his movies and this one also included Michael Dudikoff.The two work well together and help to create a very entertaining story that will keep the viewer interested and will keep the audience guessing with its many twists and turns.Excellent action and a couple of great fight scenes make this DVD worth buying.
2,A Missed Opportunity,"There is a need for a book with the ""rules"" for designing letterheads and business cards, but this isn't it. It's just one more book of ideas and suggestions, foregoing the opportunity to mention standard (but rarely outlined) guidelines that can be adhered to or just to be aware of, so that if, as I do, you have some clients who are more on the traditional side, you know the rules and reasons behind what makes a stationary system a ""system""; and then you can go ahead and bend the design rules with an understanding and better feel for how far you want to veer away. I would have liked more discussion on the organization of the small bits of text, and examples of effective and non-effective choices."
3,don't be fooled by the pictorial discription this ain't the purple or blue only the red one.(1) for the exorbient price!,"Who in hell buys toys for Hecto dollars, being a hundred plus for CHILDREN! I resent this thing even being sold! More Lucas milking for the parents and thier spectator neighbors to say ""Well, you must be a terrible Dad/Mom whatever for not buying this richy rich toy for your brat! Don't be put on by the three in the picture, you get the red only! (not that all three would be worth even half this!) I don't buy such frivolouc garbage, yet my neighbors did! That's how I know!"
3,a kid's review,"I think as a HUGE Star Wars fanatic, if you are a collector, this saber is an acceptable addition to your cllection. Of course, if your a child (who really LOVES to battle with electronic lightsabers), I truly reccomend an electronic lightsaber. A Force FX lightsaber is much too delicate, especially for battle."
4,Sith Lord Lightsaber,"I love this replica... although there are a few issues I have with it. First off, the response on the motion sensor seems to be a bit slow so that every wave of the saber will not produce a sound. Secondly, the light of the blade is not very bright outdoors, however it is sufficient in normal room brightness.All in all this is a great item and certainly worth adding to any Star Wars collection. I'm very pleased with my purchase and am considering ordering the Mace Windu Lightsaber as well."
5,Best Replica!!,This Lightaber is truly amazing. The wieght on it makes it feel really authentic. Also the hilt is perfectly replicated. The sound are awesome and the buzzing sound of the lightsaber sounds real. The one problem that I have with this lighsaber is that when you hold it can be a bit uncomfortable.
5,Excellent item for the adult Star Wars fan !!!,"I just picked up this one and the Anakin lightsaber from the local Gamestop for $99 each. I have to say they are easily each worth it, without a doubt. Just to point out, the saber itself is larger in size compared to the real thing, to accommodate the electronics, put still just fits the hands easily enough. I just got done mounting both display stands and the sabers look great there, almost as if I were mounting a pair of katana swords (Haha!).This should go without saying, but I would handle these lightsabers with care, not swinging them at anything with too much Force (another joke...haha!) Seriously, they are a great collection piece and add a lot of WOW! factor to your Star Wars collection.Finally, as I understand it, the Anakin lightsaber is hard to come by so good luck. I'm hoping to see the Luke Skywalker lightsaber from Return of the Jedi or even Mace Windu's blade would be sweet."
5,Fun for all ages,"Bought this for 3 and 6 year olds with trepidation that it would break on day 1. Far from that it has been very durable and no problems. Kids use it ""gently"" hitting one another's lightsaber and we all are wowed by the sound effects and light quality. Also purchased the Anakin replica lightsaber and happy with that one too."
5,Do You Mean ...'Saving Grace'..?,"I've never heard of this book 'Lady Johanna'...but in Julie's book 'Saving Grace', Lady Johanna is the main character...perhaps that is what you seek?"
1,The Tide is Rising on this Castle Made of Sand,"The book IS all hype. There is an inherent danger in having a business that shows people how to have a business. The danger is getting swallowed up by self-generated hype. Some books manage to escape the danger, but not this one.This book has very little useful information. If you're interested in this subject, you will need to buy a book on self-publishing, one on public speaking/seminars, and one on PR. How could this little book cover all these topics adequately. It can't."
1,This books goes nowhere...,"This book is like so many other money-making books; they get you excited, but fail to deliver any useful information. Gordon Burgett spends the entire book talking about the planning stage. At the very end of the book, he slides over the implementation stage in only a couple dozen pages. In reality, building an 'empire' takes a lot more than planning!If you have enough enthusiasm to buy this book, Gordon Burgett's book will offer nothing else to you. I feel I have wasted [money]."
2,The Vomit Hour,"Well, hello from the other side of the freakin' world.I picked this book for my lovely trip to paris and Austria. France is gorgeous and Austria is a winter wonderland, but anyway, I was somewhat dissappointed about what I reacieved. If you are a 15 year old girl or over the age of 9,THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, IS NOT FOR YOU!!!! Anyway, long story short, refrain from buying this book, if you may, it lacks in good humor what it also does in a plot.Why you say, well, it is not a novel, just a long list of to-do stuff, and it will bore the crap out of you."
3,Just Ok for Me,"I thought subject matter and locales were interesting, but the writing was a little too spare and one-dimensional for me. I'd call it a dark book and it reminds me of going back and reading an early Cormac McCarthy book, like London's impressive but still hasn't reached her full stride. I have a feeling that Joan London is going to be writing some great books in her lifetime."
5,Superb,"Gilgamesh is an excellent, excellent novel, well-written and interesting. The story, while not exotic or outlandish, still has a crisp, new, fresh feel to it. The novel concerns, mainly, Edith, a young Australian woman who is 17 in the late 30s. Her British cousin Leopold and his Armenian friend Aram, visit Edith's family farm for an extended stay. Aram and Leopold's travel stories spark Edith's imagination and after they leave, she decides, for various reasons, to follow them and seek them out in their home lands. Despite the war raging on around her, Edith manages to leave Australia and makes it to Armenia. Edith's life is interesting, her story, engaging. Ms. London writes extremely well and has given us a superb, engaging and compelling novel. Enjoy."
5,An achingly beautiful book,"That was the conclusion to my personal review of this lovely novel. After each book I read I write a little synopsis and review, in an attempt to solidify some aspects of what I have just read, before it all leaks from my colander-like memory. Normally the reviews are for me only, but I enjoyed Gilgamesh so much I thought I'd add to the avalanche of positive reviews. Here's how mine concluded: ""This is an achingly beautiful book. The language is exquisite, with delights on every page. For example, a description of Gwen on P70, 'She had pale floppy hair and shiny shins and a distracted, thin-skinned face across which colour flooded and retreated like tides.' Gorgeous. There's a Wintonian air to many of her characters, but a pure Londonian (as in Joan London) feel to the gripping narrative. As nearly flawless as a book can be."" And as an added bonus, she's Australian![...]"
4,fascinating tale,"I loved this book, having chosen it after stumbling across London's other work ""The Good Parents"" at a book exchange, and being unable to put it down. Same for this novel. Across generations and continents, it describes the struggles and determinations of very different individuals within and connected to one family to fulfill their dreams. It is also a novel of historical interest, spanning both world wars and the great depression. It moved me tremendously but was quite sad, that's why I gave it 4 not 5 stars."
5,A wonderfully crafted novel,"Gilgamesh: A Novel (winner of the 2002 Age Book of the Year award) is a wonderfully crafted novel by Joan London which is adroitly narrated by Deidre Rubenstein in this complete and unabridged audiobook version of this award winning saga. Drawing upon ancient myths to put together a hero's story of struggle, battles, the never ending search for acceptance, and finally his return home, Gilgamesh: A Novel is a profound and memorably entertaining ""theatre of the mind"" experience. Flawlessly produced, Gilgamesh: A Novel is a highly recommended addition to community library audiobook collections."
3,Prose is pedestrian,"Gilgamesh is an interesting novel, with a credible protagonist, and several good secondary characters. The Gilgamesh saga is nicely echoed in the lives of two of the characters. The novel also has a few faults. In particular, the prose is mostly pedestrian and that part of the plot centered on Armenia is contrived."
3,A Journey Back To Where It Started,"Gilgamesh has the feel of an elongated short story. At the center is Edith,a young girl living in Australia in 1937. An extended stay from her cousin Leopold and his Armenian friend Aram brings life to Edith in unexpected ways. Their departure sets off her own longing, and it's not long before she begins a journey that will take her to Soviet Armenia and eventually back. I wish I would've had the time to devour this in one sitting. Unfortunately the imapct of the novel was lost slightly because of the time it took me to finish. Still,it's a well written and lovely story."
3,Didn't really grab me,"I read this book because it was selected by my local book club. I kept reading it because I kept hoping it was going to get better, but it just never really grabbed my imagination. Yes, it was well written and I could picture a lot of the places and people, but I never got totally involved with the characters and the plot."
4,American classics of the air,"This is very nice book with lots of excellent photos of each plane described. These are not the usual recycled photos you can find in the large encyclopedias, they all look like they were made for this book. Almost every plane is photgraphed from different angles and there are a lot of in-flight pohots. Accompanying the photos there are nicely written stories related to the plane in general and to the shown plane in detail. You won't find 3-views and and data sheets in this book. Nice, but a bit pricey with 112 pages."
3,Rear Brake Shoes for 1985 E30 318i,"These replacement brake shoes for the rear drum brakes are described as ""New"", but have actually been relined. Not a problem for me.The small roll pins that provide the pivot for the adjuster levers need to be moved from your old shoes to the ones being installed. Entails a bit more work with a hammer and some pliers.Changing rear brake shoes has never been a favorite task of mine: First with the springs and all, getting everything put back together again, and then adjusting the shoes with a screwdriver through that little lugbolt hole in the drum and hub. Disc brakes are so much easier.Tip: Offered here are rear brake wheel cylinders at very economical prices. While you're in there changing out the shoes, pull back on the dust covers to check for leaks. If you spot any moisture, now is the time to change the hydraulic cylinder, as well."
4,G.I. Joe is a neat toy that kids like to play with.,I think that these toys are pretty cool. The G.I. Joe that I have is neat. It is totally flexable.If I had plenty of money I would buy a lot more. For anyone who reads this you should get one. Kids like to play with them because they have a moveable joint on all parts of their body. They are not very expensive.
4,Great toy!,The only problem with this toy is that it's so nice you may not want to use it because you dont want to ruin it. The gun fits nicely in its hands and stands freely.
5,"A great story for ALL children, especially young girls","This was one of the best new princess stories I have read. I purchased it for my daughter (2) to have in her book collection. I read the story and immediately wanted to purchase books for every little girl that I knew.The story is well written, great moral, and deals with sensitive issues like ""what is beauty"" in a wonderful way.It takes a sensitative topic and deals with it issue with grace, the way I would hope my daughter could grow to deal with such an issue.There is one drawback, and that is the advertising in the book. I am fine with the mention of a website, but was a little put off by the one page catalog in the back of the book. It wasn't enough to drop the rating, but I will cut that page out before I give the book to my daughter."
1,Not even worth burning,"This book is a conglomeration of shamanic nonsense and Nordic phylosiphies. Meadows (who obviously doesn't know anything about Native American spirituality, because the Native Americans don't have shamen, they have Medicine Men) has the hubrus to rearrange the order of the runes (they are in the ""futhark"" order for a reason, which if Meadows had done his research he would have understood this); at least his rearranging isn't as bad as Ralph Blum's. Stick with the better rune authors: Aswynn, Thorsson, and Paxson."
5,I'd like to get published.,I am writing a mainstream novel and a young adult historical fiction novel and I'd like get published as soon as I polish them up. I think this book will be a lot of help.
3,"GOOD, BUT....","Undoubtly Brittanica is a very good encyclopedia, but today, in CD-ROM and DVD version, Encarta is much better... For Britannica fans or pre-owners."
5,"Awesome, Fun Book for All Ages","My 12-month-old son absolutely loves this book. He pulls it down from his bookshelf whenever he is playing. He loves the colorful pictures and cut-out holes. He loves the song so much that now it helps calm him down when he is tired and fussy. I should also point out that I have had this book since I was a child, and I absolutely loved it as well. It's kind of random and weird, but it was published in the 70's. I think it gives the book character."
1,I Literally Threw This Book Away,"Despite its title, this is NOT a first Spanish reader. This book would be MUCH too advanced for a beginner.Plus, the typeset is ugly, which makes it even more difficult to read.Perhaps if it weren't advertised as a beginning first reader, I would be kinder to it, but this book is NOT the book it claims to be. The vocabulary is too difficult and the use of advanced verb tenses makes this unsuitable as a ""first"" reader."
2,Not mainstream,I was very disappointed in this reader. The stories are all old fables with antiquated language...less helpful for the modern reader.A few of these old stories are charming....but they soon lose their charm when you hit your ninth or tenth one.I would recommend a more contemporary book that would suit the average taste....this one is not for everybody.
4,"First Spanish Reader, But Use With Care","This is an excellent reader for use in a class where the instructor assigns readings from it and subsequently goes over them in class. However, students attempting to learn Spanish on their own are reminded that good knowledge of vocabulary and grammar is very difficult to acquire simply via comparing a translated version of a story with the original."
3,A Beginner's Dual-Language Book,"I was intrigued at how I imagined a dual language book to work, it was well versed, and has a great selection of writings. This was very enjoyable as a bedtime reader and since the writings were by different people, you get exposure to a number of uses in verbs as well as sentence structure, of which you can not get using a single study course."
1,No tiene audiencia este libro.,Las selecciones no tienen nada que ver con el mundo de este siglo. Ninguna persona puede aprovechar de esta lectura.
4,first Spanish reader,I like having the English along with the Spanish. It helps to understand the idomatic phrases as well as vocabulary. The stories are interesting also.
3,language buff,Great book. Like the proberbs and short stories. Not sure if I like the fact that the translations are right beside each article. I would have preferred it to the back so the reader/student is not tempted to look at the translations while reading.
5,My Grandson will love it.,I know my 9-1/2 year old grandson will like this book once helearns enough Spanish to read it.
1,Not for Beginners,"This book is not for beginners for sure. One needs to know the basics before you buy this one. For me, I'd say waste of money."
4,well-organized,"The format is friendly for those trying to improve their Spanish. The stories are leveled, and the verb tenses vary in the stories. Besides its educational value, it's just plain fun as well."
3,a slow pace,"I gave this book 3 stars because the pace is a little slow. There's plenty of advanced vocabulary right from the beginning but you have to wait 16 stories before you even get to the past tense (And who wants to read in the present tense for 15 pages?). If this is for beginners they should tone down the vocab usage in the beginning; keep it simpler. If it's for intermediate students they should pick up the pace grammatically. However, there's plenty of reading to go through after the grammar does catch up and so it's not as bad as it seems."
5,I like it...with certain reservations,"This book is inexpensive, has an intersting assortment of parables, proverbs and short-stories, and is graded to get progressively more difficult as you read it.For what it's supposed to be, I think it's an excellent choice.My only reservation is that it was originally published in 1964. In my experience studying Japanese, I know that language can go through many changes through the decades, so I'm just curious if the language is ""current"" or a bit ""dated.""I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it, though. At the price it's definitely worth it."
1,Ghostbustin Pat,"After reading this book, like Slimer from Ghostbusters I barfed all over the place. After reading the sex scenes in this book, I felt like The Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghoustbusters: bloated."
4,Nice opera.,"Interesting opera. If you like contemporary classical music this is for you. It includes the complete libretto. Note: ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is even better."
1,Didn't get the right necklace!,"I ordered this 24 inch 2.5mm necklace and received a 26 inch 1.5mm necklace and had to return it. The weight of this necklace is said by Amazon to weigh 6.2 grams, but a sterling silver necklace of this length and thickness should weigh around 10 grams. Be sure to measure the width of your necklace it could be wrong!"
3,Action film is good.,"Skeleton Coast is your run of the mill adventure film set in a foreign country with revolutionaries. Of course there's the money and intrigue and double crosses. You've seen it all before. Highlight is, of course, Ernest Borgnine, who always brings something special to his roles."
2,Great book concept - poor execution,"While my 2.5 year old daughter loves this book, I am afraid it will not last very long. The interactive gas pump, oil dip stick, and other features are not constructed for a child to use. The cardboard bends easily, and the slots to stick the devices in are not readily usable, even for an older child. Hopefully upon future printings the publisher will upgrade the above."
3,Nice timer,Have been using it for a while. Nice timer. Don't know what other reviewers were talking about. It worked for me perfect. The only complaint (if any) is that it actually rings at somewhere 1~2 but zero.
2,Not a Great Timer,The timer looks nice and it rings nice and loud for a few seconds. The ticking is a little louder than I would like but it lets you know you've got something cooking=) I was very happy with this timer but now that I have owned it for three months it has become unreliable. Sometimes it finishes just great any many times it gets stuck with five minutes left to go and it never ends up ringing. I bring the timer almost to 60 and then put it on the minutes I want and it still never ends up ringing because it gets stuck. I looked at it today and it was set for three-five minutes- I had set it yesterday for 10 minutes. Lucky for me I went by the clock and didn't burn my food.
3,Packaging is terrible - product looks nice,It's one of those terrible hard plastic packages that you practically need to cut into with a buzz saw. Why make it so hard to open the darn thing. That said - it looks nice. Grumble grumble.
4,Great but bulky,"My first impression of the toothbrush was how bulky it was. My roommate has a Sonicare and I figured it would be roughly the same size, but it seems bigger. It almost looks a little ridiculous, it has a huge handle and a small brush head.But once you start brusing your teeth with it you forget about it and just enjoy it. It's simply amazing how clean your teeth feel when you are done brushing with it.The toothpaste refills are a little pricey and they don't seem to be sold everywhere, but you can always put regular toothpaste on the brushhead if you wish.Overall I'm happy with the product, but not with the size."
2,"Good performance, gets extremely dirty inside, one toothpaste option","This brush performs well. However, use it for 3 weeks and take a look inside--it's filled with bacteria and grime. This stuff is very difficult to remove, especially from inside the part that holds the brush. This is not good because the same bacteria that comes out of your mouth can reinfect your mouth every time you brush.It tends to stay wet inside the brush which makes a great place for this stuff to thrive. The only toothpaste that will work with this is the overpriced Crest toothpaste. I only use Colgate Total (with Triclosan) so I never bothered adding another cartridge after the first few.Don't be fooled--using this brush does NOT replace the need for flossing. Save some money and get the normal Sonicare brush without toothpaste."
2,Here's the REAL review:,"(Harriet Klausner suckered me into buying more dud books with her damn 5 star raves ... until I caught wise. Now I know when she writes a 4/5 star review, it's usually bogus.)The REAL review of this novel is that it's DULL. I felt had no enthusiasm for this story. Ms. Smith wanted to tell a moving, tear-jerking love story but ended up with a silly, shallow plot (the so-called mystery of who's writing threatening letters to Vie is solved in a really dumbed-down way!) and there's a clumsy feel to its execution. There's no tension, there's no excitement. I give it 2 stars for the hero, who has some depth to him, but for the rest: the heroine; plot; supporting characters; dialog - bah humbug. After reading ""For the First Time"" I thought Kathryn Smith was an author to watch for, but this novel is a big step backward."
4,strong collection of essays,"I've had to read a slew of leadership books for my doctorate -- as for a collection of thoughtful essays, this is one of the best. It's well organized, well laid out and has almost every major thinker represented. It's got theoretical parts, practical parts and questions for down the road. The essays span all types of learning organizations: schools, hospitals, companies, etc... It's a bit long, but if you take it piece by piece, this is a very enjoyable and informative collection. Highly recommended and well-conceived."
3,Perspectives on Learning Organizations,"As far as I can see it is a book all about different perspectives, a book that adds on to the list of books that focus on the theoretical and/or philosophical sides of learning organizations. As such it is a good book, with contributions from 40 acknowledged authors/researchers.The book is built up around four parts:- Guiding ideas- Theories/Methods/Processes- Infrastructure- Arenas of PracticeThe book is packed with lots of good ideas that may form a base for further exploration in the field. Most of it is well edited, even though there is some extra ""fluff"" in some of the articles.It is a good introduction to ""learning organizations"", but I will hesitate to call it a ""how-to""-book . . . ."
5,Thank you for good ideas!,"I loved this book! Certainly, I won't use every page...but the creative ideas on scripture memory and mommy tape, will FOREVER affect my children's lives. All of the ""times""...my children naturally do. I set a timer in the morning when one gets up too early to have their own ""quiet time"", but they naturally read books and have private play times during the day. I loved this book, very practical, very short, with the emphasis on the Word of God and HOW to get it into your child's heart starting young. Thanks Allen and Connie!"
1,Not for the liturgical life and unoriginal to boot,"This booklet's ideas for family times are quite uncreative-- things like playdoh time, drawing time, etc. are nothing parents couldn't have figured out on their own. Furthermore the ideas for making audio-tapes are only good if you are one of the few who still owns an audio-tape player. What most turned me off by the book, however, was the suggestions for teaching your kids to sit perfectly still and silently for long periods of time to prepare them for ""church."" As a Lutheran, I don't believe in teaching my kids to quietly observe worship, but to actively participate in the liturgy, hymns, prayer, the Lord's Supper, etc. Whether or not they can sit still for preaching isn't the heart of the worship experience for adults or children."
1,Waste of money,"Not up to standards and did not Meet My expectations. Being a speech pathologist, it did not help my students."
2,Could Have Been So Much Better,"I wanted to like this book. The ideas are good, and the activities effective, but they're riddled with errors. An activity that asks the students to shade verbs in a chart and leave behind a number, for example, doesn't leave a number behind. A number of activities suffer from proofreading and editing problems, which a grammar book should never, ever have, rendering large portions of the book unusable. Pity."
4,Love this book,I use this book for teaching a remedial English class to college students and it's an excellent supplement to the course text. The exercises are fun and make what can otherwise be a very dull subject a little more interesting. Students also like working in groups on the puzzles and games.This is a great text for reinforcing basic grammar rules in a fun and engaging manner.
4,Classy looking and functional collar,"I ordered this collar because I didn't like the looks/design of the kitty collars I found in the pet stores. Also, at the time my kittens (I have two) were only 12 weeks old, so I was looking for a collar that would adjust with their growth. I'm happy to report that this collar (I ordered two, in different colors) has been great. Even the vet noticed the collar and remarked how neat it is. The collar looks really sharp and has a nice sized metal loop for hanging an ID tag, etc. Both kittens took to this collar just fine (it was their first collar) and I have been able to let the collar out a bit as they've grown. I also like the fact that there's no ""extra collar"" hanging out past the buckle -- the collar just forms a big loop around the kitty's neck. The only issue I've had is one of the collars is a bit hard to adjust -- but overall I've been very pleased."
1,Not a safe collar,"I bought one of these for my small cat. When I looked the collar over I found I was able to pull on one of the two adjustable portions and the collar tightened. While that is good for adjusting size, it also would choke the cat if just this part of the collar was snagged. I tossed it."
3,Definitely light weight but looks cheap,".........not sure what else to put here, the headline sums it up fairly well. My two cats can't stand regular collars but when input these on, they don't even know they're on...until you add the rabies and name tags. Hmmm..."
4,Function!,"Super low-key collar. My cat barely notices it. The original one was defective so the company promptly replaced it, which was refreshing. The new one works great."
4,Nice and discreet,"I love this collar because it doesn't matte my cat's hair like other collars would. It breaks off easily if you pull on it. It also doesn't draw too much attention to itself, which is exactly what I wanted. The only thing is that I need to continuously tighten it because it stretches out. But otherwise, a great product. I wish there was more color variety."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,THIS HELMET COMES IN PIECES. I HAD TO GLUE IT TOGETHER TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING APART. IT IS ALSO PAPER THIN AND TOO LARGE FOR AN ADULTS HEAD LET ALONE A CHILD ( THE MOST OBVIOUS USER). THIS IS JUNK.
2,Not Too Great. . .,"Unless you're willing to splend countless hours modifying this helmet, it's NOT worth your time. Your only use for this peice of slag is for creation of a mold to recast it. Even though I abhor recasting, this helmet can't possibly be honored by anything else than major reconstruction."
2,Not worth the money,"This helmet is poorly made and requires 3 hands to assemble. And once it's finally assembled it will not stay assembled if played with. Plus, this thing is huge. Definitely too large for kids."
4,My son enjoys role play,This was for my 8 year old son. He likes the helmet and dressing up like a clone trooper. It is better quality and more sturdy than the childs helmet but it is significatly bigger.
2,Not good for behind-the-ear's,"I bought this for my hearing aid, but the jar is a little too small for behind the ear units. Also, the color indication for saturation of the pellets does not work. All-in-all, I guess I wasted my money on this."
4,A Classic!,My mother grew up listening to some of these lullabies (she is from Peru). It is a classic! I use a couple of songs to comfort my children when they are upset. My kids love it!
3,"CD is good, but not great","I have an 19 month old daughter and bought this CD for car rides to provide entertainment and more exposure to the Spanish language. It does serve that function, however, my daughter is only interested in about half of the songs on the CD."
5,My daughter loves it!!!,My daughter is 3 months old and she loves this CD!! She moves her little legs when I sing while I'm cleaning! The songs and very well done...it reminds me of my childhood!
2,eh,"I guess I should have listened to the samples better. Not what I hoped for, but that's my personal taste."
4,Songs in Spanish,"The songs wer known to many of my kids but not to my families, so that was a nice surprise."
2,Poor sound quality!!!,"While the songs are nice, the volume of the different voices is at all different levels. I thought it was our stereo at first, but have since tried it in the computer as well as another stereo. It's definitely a problem with the CD recording. Some of the voices are so soft you cannot tell what they are saying, which ruins the songs (as the singers are one at a time). Also, it's only 33 minutes long. Look elsewhere for a good Spanish CD for kids."
3,Spanish CD,"I thought that this CD would have the Happy Birthday song on it, but it didn't.I also thought it would have the ABC's song in Spanish and it didn't."
3,OK,"This cd sounds very old fashioned. Although the songs are traditional, a more contemporary sound would be better for today's kids."
4,Inter. Accounting,This book along with the Student Survival Guide was a great help to me. I just walked out of class with a 100 on my last test! Now for the final. Not near as nervous because these books have pushed me to remember the information that I normally wouldn't. Great buy!!
4,a trip out film,"I was just gonna watch the film because I think RObert De Niro is one of the Greatest Actors Ever, but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of Being Black&that truly adds another factor to this film.it's a trip out film."
2,"Hi, Mom!","For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
3,50/50,"I purchased 2 of these collars (mango orange and snowball white), 1 for each of my 2 cats. One loves it and has only taken it off once. My other cat won't keep it on. It bothers her neck I think. I have had these since April 2012 and the cat who hates it has managed to put all kinds of teeth holes in the clasp and chew marks on the collar itself. She wriggles her bottom jaw through the bottom part and stretches it out so she can take it off. OR if the part nearest to her chin is the clasp, she chews on it until it pops open. I am not sure this is a flaw in the design or functionality of this product but it has since been lost for a month or so."
4,reliable,"running smoothly. no signs of wearing (knock on wood... ) could use it for another 100,000 miles on my maxima"
3,Not as good as most.- An enigmatic man.,"I really dont think that this is up to Carole Mortimers usual standard. I found it hard going to get into this story line and when I had finished the book I was somewhat dissapointed. It is about two characters, both trying to put the past behind them which I found quite dull. Carole has been one of my favourite writers for years but this story was weak. For me anyway."
1,customer beware....... just buy chips instead..,This is the second time to purchase rio Rancho bowls... we liked the flavor so well...however on both occassions bowls were broken... the first time 3out of six... this last time five out of six... so broken we just had chips!...While many would say..is it the manufacturers problem.... the question is..how do other companies package shells without breaking...No company website and no response from a written letter sooo I would say I am done with rio rancho... they are now called rio raunchy in the way they handle client complaints..parker ..stillwater ok
2,tostada bowls,"I would give this item 5 stars if they were made a little thicker. Most bowls were broken when delivered and were useless, and you had to handle the ones that were not broken with extreme care."
1,Stale,I bought these at Hannaford a year ago and they were not bad...I recently bought them again and boy were they terrible!! They were stale! and tasteless. I looked at the experation date and it said 2-12-13. I am very unhappy with this product and will not buy again.
1,Confusing & full of errors,"I read a lot of technical books, and this was definitely the worst for a long time !* The presentation jumps back and forth, often using concepts before they've been explained.* Many explanations are opaque and confusing, while others are superficial and repetitive.* The examples given are unhelpful (e.g. discussing the effects of stylesheets and templates without showing the document being processed).* The code samples are full of misleading typos.* The authors do not even follow their own rules for variable naming etc.A waste of money."
3,Not Too Shabby...,"Mastering XML is not very good as a reference guide. However, if you have patience and read each chapter you will defintely gain some good XML knowledge.This being the first XML book I have seriously read, I cannot give a comparitive grade. But, if you have no clue what XML or DTD's are, or how to write them, I would not discourage you from reading this book."
1,90% theory --- Total loss of money,"Had there been zero star in the selection, I would have given to it. I bought this book just because it was of Mastering series but I found it too bad. Examples selected are very ordinary. It is more a novel like thing than any programming book. Reading this book , you will end up with zero. I recommend XML By Example, far better than this book."
2,Not That Helpful,"The book has a few good practical suggestions for XML, like ""Now Throw the DTD Away."" However, the bulk of the 900 pages contain a rather roughly written overview of XML that is not helpful to the student trying to master XML for some productive use. The various programs on the included disk are likewise not very helpful, which may indicate that the main problem is with the current state of the subject matter. XML is receiving a tremendous amount of hype over an undeveloped and time-consuming variation of SGML, a complex mark-up language that has existing for more than a decade without revolutionizing anything."
2,Go elsewhere.....,"Beginners - Look somewhere else for an XML book. Intermediates - Look somewhere else for an XML book. Experts - Look somewhere else for an XML book.By far, one of the worst reference books out there. This book is for an insomniac. Stick with a Wrox or Sams book."
2,The Information is There ... Somewhere,"Another review noted the errors and there are certainly lots. I've only read the namespaces sections and some of the XSL sections but the errors and typos make it very tough going. This is not a book for the beginner. If you're familiar enough with XML then this book seems to have a lot of information but, with the errors and inconsistent levels of explanation, it doesn't look worth the cost. Look for another book."
4,Great music,"I'm a big fan of Dan Gibson and have 16 of his albums. But the music on this cd is so great that the nature sounds are actually a distraction. This is not a relaxation cd like the rest of my Gibson collection. Bob de Angelis plays clarinet, and is backed by piano, bass, and guitar for 71 minutes of old standards. Bird sounds are overlaid on all tracks and most also have streams or surf too. The nature sounds are not overwhelmed by the music like a few others. I played this album yesterday and today ordered three of Bob de Angelis's cds without nature sounds so I now have the best of both worlds."
3,More of a Master's Thesis,"While this book provides an excellent general overview and evolution of worldwide coat/shirt/kimono construction, it is hardly a detailed description of any one period or nation. But that is to be expected it is only 36 pages long. One of the reviewers must be referring to a different book as this one has NO DOUBLET PATTERN at all. In general as a reference it is interesting, as an instruction manual on the order of Janet Arnold it is not even close."
1,offensive bumper sticker,"This is a sick bumper sticker. There are actual cases of people microwaving animals and it's really sick, evil and sad. Do not buy this bumper sticker to encourage evil people to do such acts to animals. We should treat animals with love and take care of them and be kind to them."
1,ONLY FOR THOSE SEEKING THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR...,"As a cat lover, I find this bumper sticker offensive. Moreover, all it takes is one really sick individual on the road to think that this actually would be a fun thing to do, just to see what happens, causing some poor, defenseless cat untold suffering, leading to its death.Some people do not need to have any more bad ideas put into their heads. There are some really evil people out there who are always looking for something diabolical to do. Do not give them any more bad ideas. Avoid this bumper sticker, as you would the plague."
1,Run Away -- Run Away,This book is only worth purchasing as a doorstopThere are numerous errors in the test areas. The result is that you can not determine whether or not you are indeed prepared. It will waste your time to use these materials; to speak much less of your money!
2,Poor quality control,"The contents of the book are OK if you already know Java and want to quickly brush up. There is too much assumed to just pick this book up as your first Java certification book. My major complaint is that there are numerous errors in the question and answers and on the CD's practice exam which is the main reason for buying. It is very frustrating to look at a list of answers and feel that none of them are correct or to look for a third when only two are - you find yourself doubting your knowledge and then, doubting the rest of the book's contents."
4,What you need to know to be certified,"The subject says it all. This book isn't designed to teach a newbie to code Java, but for those that have Java experience and want to know what subjects are needed to pass the certification. There are other books that go into greater detail, but you will pay 2x more. If you have the $, go for the others, but for the cost, this is a great buy!!"
4,"Excellent Java book to clear concept, but not for newbies.","This is a very good Java book for not only the certification exam but also the one which helps you to get clear concept. I have experience in programming Java and now decide to go certified. I do feel this book help me quite a lot in the exam preparation. It serves as a very good review for the Java knowledges I have. The price of the book is also very nice. I can say that you get far more than you paid. One thing I would like to mention is this book probably a little bit tough for the newbies. If you are new to Java and do not have much OOP experience, I will not recommand you this one. Although most of comments here are negative, I still want to give this book a high rating."
5,Lovely in its simplicity!,"Donaghe is one of my favorite writers and Uncle Sean does not disappoint. Uncle Sean may be a trifle short even if it is meant to be the first of a trilogy. However the depth of the characters and the heart warming story more than made up for it. Will's coming-out and his love for his uncle which was not meant to be is touchingly told. Finally Will's finding his true love, Lance, just brightens my day. I am glad this is not the end."
5,The Begining of a Great Series!,Uncle Sean is the first in what promises to be a fantastic series of novels (are they really novels or did Ron really find Will's journal) Whatever you do be sure and read Uncle Sean and Lance the soon to be released sequal!
5,The Start of A Great Series,"Fell in love with the characters and the story is one that you don't want to end!!! I read the whole series Uncle Sean, Lance and All Over Him in 2 weeks. Ron Donaghe Did it again with this one. A Must Read"
4,Fun Made-for-TV Chick flick!,"Okay I will set my stall out straight off. Firstly I am a huge admirer of Amber Benson, both as a person and as a multi-talented artist, so any thought I have concerning a movie she does comes with a certain bias. Secondly, I'm a 40 year old guy. and as such I'm clearly not the target demographic for this film.So with stall set is the film worth your time? I would yes very much so. The film is funny, has a good heart and good performances from a cast who understand that this is pure fantasy and schmaltz but to their credit, dont really play the schmaltz that hard making it much more palatable. A couple of female members of my family have watched the film and they enjoyed it thoroughly and as they are the target of this film, I'd call that a resounding success.So get the film, its fun."
1,Excellent Movie But I will never see it,I was not aware(my fault) that I could not play this dvd on a US cd player. It is in Australian format that I guess I was unaware was different. Great movie if I ever get a US version. Recommended but How many Stars? I couldn't see it.
5,Very Good Book,This book covers wide range of topics in C including data structure implementation and does them well. It is a good introductory book as well as reference. My only gripe is that his symbol precedence chart is confusing.
3,Very Good As A Second C Book- Fills In Details....,"I would not recommend this book to a begining programmer, but I would recommend it as a second programming book. After you feel comfortable with data types, flow of control, functions, arrays, and pointers this book covers those topics more rigorously. In addition, the book also includes short sections on data structures and recursion. The coverage of algorithms and data structures is not sufficient to use as a reference, but it is an excellant introduction because of its readability and well written explanations."
2,The quality of the disc is very disappointing.,"First of all, this disk is not DTS not even dd5.1 no extra, very poor video quality, this one shouldn't have been on DVD."
4,"The Phoenix Saga rocks, but...","Im glad they are starting to release DVD versions of Xmen. One problem though, why havnt they just released the seasons rather then just episodes here and there. Ive been a fan of the xmen for quite a while now.. to figure out that they should have entire seasons on dvd. Anyways if u never seen the original xmen series get this dvd. Its really cool."
4,Worth getting for X Men fans,The 1st thing you notice is that the transfer is beautiful. The colors are intense and the images are crisp. I saw this originally when broadcasted on TV and it doesn't come close.The story is a bit long winded but it is nice to see Jean Gray doing something for a change.The animation style is not as sleek as the stuff you see on TV today but I like the attitude of the characters better than the current Xmen generation. There was so much more drama in the older series.
4,Very Good Story,The only thing missing from this DVD is the immediate following episodes of the cartoon explaining the remaining Phoenix storyline: Dark Phoenix. It takes you from the tragic ending of the Pheonix Saga to what happens to the Pheonix entity as it explores the darker side of humanity.
1,marketing channels,This book is hard to read. It lives me feeling like i'm going in circles. I may drop the class that uses this book. I'm having a hard time answering assignment questions and am very frustrated with this book. Please think before you assign this book for a class.
3,"A bit tedious at first, moderately entertaining, semi-interesting characters","I loved Sean's Centurian Empire so I thirsted for more, and bought Souls in the Machine.The story is based in future Australia, and could use a map for us Americans who dont get all the references.I'll probably order the second one in the series, but this was much weaker than the Centurian."
3,"Great story, weak characterization","I really liked this book, and I'm going to read the sequels; but I have one problem with it: the characters are a little wooden. For example, Zarvora is a cardboard cutout through most of the book; we know why she does what she does, but we don't really sympathize with it.What really brings the characterization problem into the foreground is the second time a trusted character turns traitor for no apparent reason. There's no buildup, no explanation after the fact, nothing; just a sudden discovery that he's been stabbing Zarvora in the back. It just doesn't ring true.Oh, and there's one other recurring irritation: the railroads are called ""paralines"", even though the railroad engineers have conciously modeled their work on surviving 19th- and 20th-century texts; there's no reason for them to have made up a new word...much less one that I keep misreading as ""pralines"". :-)"
2,I wanted to like it...,"At first I was totally enraptured by the book with its innovative ideas and odd socio-political structure. However, the book wore me down over time because of two major problems which kept cropping up.1) The author is constantly 'fast-forwarding' his story with no warning what-so-ever. One minute, two characters are entering a desert to find somebody. The next, one is some kind of monk and the other is a warlord. Say what?!?!2) The coincidences are extraordinary. The characters are all doing their own things, wandering back and forth across the continent, yet every time one of them is in a city they manage to accidentally run into each other. I can't really go into the other coincidences without giving away parts of the story to those of you who want to read this.400 pages into the book, I've decided to toss it aside and forget it. I would advise you to pass on this book before you even hit page one."
3,Different,"A strange vision of a post apocalypstic world (Australia), where a woman of genius is trying to set things right. It is sometimes hard to decide who is the protagonist, who is the villian, what is right and what is wrong. Good reading, thought provoking, but hard to get through."
2,Was I the only one thinking it difficult to read?,"I expected something...different that what I found. The premise alone was enought to make me by the book. I started it three times and had to almost force myself to continue. The various vignettes seemed part of the story but the action did not proceed linearally, The idea of desperately needing technology when it is not allowed sounded like a great plot yet the pace was too slow, the actions too disjointed to appreciate.Perhaps there was something else. When action occurs in the far future it is imperative that the author use discretion in establishing a whole new society with new terms, names and mores. Understanding and digesting the society was a task as big as following the story line. This idea has great potential."
5,the Blackgloom Bounty,This is nice escapist fantasy fiction. It is very Celtic in setting and outlook. I would not call it Arthurian at this point though I could see it going in that direction. Itwas a fun read and I look forward to more.
2,Not so good,"This book has received some amazing reviews and I thought it would be worth a read. Unfortunately the book was a big disappointment. The characters are flat and the author attempts to bring together far too many elements to make this ""medieval fantasy"" work. Common sword and sorcery themes are played out in ways that are only surprising in their rapidity."
2,Unsatisfying,"This book, as the title implies, is very unsatisfying. It really did have a chance to be a good or even a great book.I don't think it deserves one star like a couple other reviewers gave it, but I don't think it deserves five either. My rating is two and a half stars, but since you can't do a half, it's only two.More character development and better more fluid prose and this novel could have been really good. Maybe in the sequel the author will have improved, I sure hope so."
5,The Blackgloom Bounty,A rip roaring ride from start to finish! An excellent entertaining read. Fanatasy lover or not this is a laugh out loud page turner. I can't wait for the next installment.
5,One of the very best tales to ever cross my desk for review.,"Filled to the ramparts with rich, detailed description and rapid, flowing action, The Blackgloom Bounty is sure to snare the hearts of true lovers of fantasy and carry them off into this captivating world. Jon F. Baxley has the style, wit, and imagination to become a legend himself in the world of fantasy fiction. So, tap a keg of mead and get settled into your favorite chair, because this story will have you clamped in the stocks right until the very end.--John Patrick Schmitz, The Door to Worlds Imagined"
4,Enjoyable Story.,"I enjoyed this story. There were a few times that I felt like I missed part of the story, because it seemed to have jumped ahead. I had gotten a free PDF copy of this book for my Kindle, so maybe it was an error in the file.I will definitely read the sequels to see how the story continues. I will agree with some of the posters that not enough time was spent drawing us, as readers, into caring about the characters. By the end of the book you are interested in their outcome because you've spent so much time with them, but I still feel like I didn't really have any kind of emotional investment in any particular character. That would be the only change I would recommend for future sequels.Overall, I enjoyed the book and feel that Mr. Baxley will turn this into a wonderful series."
1,Poorly Written,"This book was boring and just couldn't hold my interest, and the prose and characters were flat."
5,A fine addition to any mathematics or educational comic collection,"Some people teach mathematics with a chalkboard. Samuel Valenza teaches with his own abstract comics. ""Professor Googols: Flying Time Machine & Atomic Space Capsule"" is a unique way to learn about numbers as Valenza presents many comics discussing the nuances of mathematics in a quirky, bizarre style that will teach and entertain many young readers who are trying to grasp the finer details of mathematics. ""Professor Googols"" is a fine addition to any mathematics or educational comic collection."
4,So nice BUT,"I like this book so much, when you just knows that DK is the publisher, you can make sure that this book is a very high quality, the pictures and designs is more than great, its really wonderful and i liked it so much, but i prefer if they include an empty pages for our creative idea. Otherwise, its the best book you can use as a record for your merrage and wedding part."
2,Men's groin protector,"Got this as a prop for a costume. I wanted a red one, but they sent black. Disappointed. Had to paint it red. LS"
4,Good Value,"After 39 years of woodworking, one thing I've learned is that most people use sanding belts too long, way beyond their effectiveness. The best solution is a bunch of belts at a low cost. And here they are."
4,Great,Good book i bought it and i like it but dont like the reviews they annoy me to no end and sone day i will talk to someone
2,Other Books,"Wilbur Smith likes the African historical saga. He doesn't mind having a pilot adventurous type or two in his stories, either.Here we have the strong brave woman, the dashing husband, struggle for survival in the wilderness, and an impregnation. Add in a dastardly bloke or two, and there you have it."
5,Very memorable book,"I read this book several years ago, yet it stands out vividly in my mind. I feel that I will always remember the outline of this compelling and adventuresome story unlike the vast majority of routine novels that I have read.If you like the sound of an African adventure novel with a young shipwrecked woman struggling to survive, I highly recommend it!"
3,Not the best of Wilbur Smith,"I'm only 18, but i've read River God and The Seventh Scroll, and i absolutely fell in love with them! But the Burning Shore just didn't do it for me... Centaine De Thiry is forced to live through the torchers of lonlinees, hunger, thirst and survival as she finds herself stranded in the namibian desert. She fights not only for her life, but for the life that her dead husband, Michael Courtney, has left inside her womb.You will fall in love with Centaine... But Wilbur Smith decided to give the ending a dull and unhappy twist."
4,The Courtney Dynasty continues,True Wilbur Smith excitement and spellbinding story telling. How can you not be addicted to the fortunes of this family? Excellent reading.
3,another great wilbur smith novel,"the courtneys of africa is a must read....The only reason I gave this one 3 stars instead of 4 was that it took too long to get into the book. When you put the courtney saga together, it is one of the all time great epics....try to read them in order...."
4,An entertaining read,I have read the series and find it to be an easy to read piece of histroic fiction. Good plane travel material.
3,rating,"The shipping was fast. The actual sock is cute and works well with many types of shoes, but after two times of wearing them, they ripped already."
3,It is too slow,"this dictionary is too slow. every time you need to enter a word, you have to click on a button. It is not possible to just erase the last word by pressing Esc and type in a new one. The CD needs to be kept in the cd-rom while using the dictionary. The window only takes up a third of the screen and it is not possible to view the dictionary in full window either. Enteries are alright with simple definitions and pictures."
1,Good idea but poor construction,"I really liked the concept of this collar. The soft and rounded fabric looked like it would be very comfortable on a cat. I ordered 3 collars but was very disappointed with them. The snap apart feature was so hard to come apart that the collar itself broke away from the snap rendering the whole thing useless. This happened on two of the three collars. The 3rd one was also hard to snap apart but at least the collar stayed connected. The metal tubes that are used to adjust the size of the collar are bulky and don't look comfortable for a cat. The collar slides very easily through them but so easily that it appears the collar would not hold its size once it was placed on the cat. Also, these metal tabs are open on the ends making it possible for your cat to catch a claw inside one of the open ends if it scratches its neck. I returned all 3 collars and would never buy this product again."
1,Poorly made,Collar was so poorly made I threw it out. The metal used to adjust the sizing was bulky and seemed unsafe.Shame on me for not enlarging the photo and taking a really good look.
5,Great collar,"This collar is excellent. Many breakaway collars come off just in regular play, however this collar would come off if it needed to but not all the time. That and it's thin enough to not be as cumbersome on my smaller cat. A+"
2,My cat escaped from this collar in 2 seconds flat!,"Sorry guys, but I think this is a cheaply-made item. My cat flipped this collar off her neck in about 2 seconds. What you can't see is that the two silver ""adjustors"" are some kind of metal cylinder clamped on the edges to hold the position of the nylon cord. I found the crimped edges to be sharp! Held just so, it could give you a nasty slice on your finger. My cat kept scratching at it, and even caught her claw in the doubled up section. I had to rescue her. The other cat just scraped it over his head.Two-thumbs down! It is not worth the postage for me to return it as unsatisfactory! Beware. I do NOT recommend this for small cats or kittens!"
1,Not Safe,I bought two of these collars but I am afraid to use them as the aluminum ferrules are so tight that it takes a lot of force to slide them. The weight of the cats is not enough to make the collar open. They would hang and strangle if the collar got caught.
1,UNSAFE FOR MY CAT!,Did not stretch or easily adjust. I CUT UP and threw away three that I had bought. My cat wore under close supervision and almost hung himself. I worry that other cats are wearing something like this especially home alone.
5,Super Funny.,This first season of The PJ's is super funny; I have enjoyed bonding with friends over these DVD's and am looking forward to watching seasons 2 & 3.
4,great smelling soap,"I stayed at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires and they use LATHER brand soap in the powder rooms. I ordered this for $8.00. I enjoyed it a lot, but it did not last as long as I was hoping."
2,Poor compilation.,"I was expecting this book to go above and beyond what the Medical School Admissions Requirements provides (published by the AAMC). Instead, it fell short in several basic areas, and I decided to promptly return it. To be honest, I'm a little angry with TPR for putting out such a mediocre guide. Don't waste your time--just buy the MSAR--it's a much richer source of information."
3,"Comprehensive Review, Not Shame for Princeton","While Bastyr University is one of multiple medical schools in the United States to provide education for naturopathic medical doctors, it is far from a science that should be dismissed as ""quackery."" The medical education received by naturopathic medical doctors specializes in the training of primary care physicians who are willing to pursue whatever avenue possible in order to heal their patients. Naturopathic medicine recognizes the individuality of patients and seeks to treat those patients as effectively as possible. Many times a simple change in diet or herbal remedy can fix these issues.Allopathic is not derogatory, by the way. Allopathic just means treating differently, while homeopathy means treating with the same. Back when the the terms were coined allopaths were doing things like bloodletting in order to treat disease. Bloodletting did not have any correlation with the disease, hence it was termed ""allopathy."""
4,Overall a good guide,"Being a non-traditional applicant I found this guide very helpful- it has a lot of useful information on preparing for med school including MCAT, applications, essays, interviewing, etc. Another bonus- it has a section explaining the differences and similarities between allopathic & osteopathic med schools which other guides don't cover adequately. The only negative about this guide is the applicant stats on the profiled schools- it isn't up to date but I guess this can be remedied by referring to the annual guides published by AAMC or AOA."
1,Not the same Princeton,"It should be noted that ""The Princeton Review"" has nothing but its name in common with Princeton University. It's an ""educational preparation"" company, whose core business is test coaching.The contents of this book have not been authorised, or as far as I know even seen, by Princeton University."
1,Blue-green fingers...,We have blue-green fingers after fiddlin' with this masterpiece. Nothing but globs of paint. Papa isn't smart enough to make those fancy patterns... maybe Grandma should try with her magic touch. Avoid this one unless you want to waste paint and whatever you decide to put in the spinn' tray. The happy little girl in the picture obviously isn't helping to clean up the mess.
3,Not as good as advertised,"I guess you can't ever except anything to be as good as it's advertised and this is not exception. Paint dribbles out and frequently makes unattractive globs and lots of paint is wasted down the sides making the paint canisters not last very long. Plus I found assembly to be a headache. Worst is I got it for doing t-shirts since my daughters love to decorate clothes. However I can't even get my two year olds t-shirts to fit right.I give it three stars though because it is still fun and it's easier then spin art because I don't have to worry about cutting the paper just right and fitting it in, and trying to get slick paper."
1,Worst toy this year. Needs to be improved.,I got this for my daughter for christmas. We have used it three times. Each time I wash it before use and it still does the same thing. The paint always clumps. It is a real mess to clean up. I did not like it at all.
4,It's better than a regular sunshade.,"I love the fact that it's cut specifically for my 2006 Ford E450 Van. My only complain is that it's a little bit too big, there for it bunches up a little. Aside from that.. it's great!"
5,Great collection from the 20th Century's greatest voice,"Nelson Eddy was the greatest baritone of the 20th Century. This collection brings forth songs made popular from his movies of the 1930's and 40's. From powerfully stirring numbers such as Tramp, Tramp,Tramp and The Mounties to aching songs of love such as Lover Come Back to Me and Balalaika. If you are looking for an eye (and ear) opening musical experience, I highly recommend Nelson Eddy's Greatest Hits. If God ever created the perfect voice he did so in Nelson Eddy."
1,Manufacturer discontinued over 5 years ago -- no warranty!!,"Ordered this from Amazon/WhitneyFancher on May 25, 2011. Received beautiful new weather radio and followed instructions on initial charging, etc. Radio works only for a very short time then dies. I recharge overnight but radio dies again after 10 minutes of usage. After multiple calls I've learned Vector was purchased by Black & Decker in 2006, then Black & Decker sold to Baccus Global in 2010. The company selling here on Amazon (WhitneyFancher) is NOT an authorized retailer, and if they were, they would not be selling this product because it's been discontinued because of the battery issue. So, now I'm past the 30 days to return the item, there's no warranty whatsoever, WhitneyFancher will not return my email (there's no telephone number) so basically I'm out $60. Thanks a lot, Amazon."
1,No customer support!,"Received this as a gift this past Christmas and finally opened it several weeks ago. It works great on A/C power but goes dead when unplugged. The battery won't hold a charge. It took phone calls to three different companies to finally find out that this radio hasn't been made for several years and is no longer supported. At first, they said the battery wasn't covered by the one year warranty. I pointed out that the owner's manual didn't say that the battery was excluded. I pushed the 1 year warranty issue and was told that if I shipped it back and it proved to be defective, the best they would do is to exchange it for a different type of product- perhaps a spot light. Do not buy this radio!"
1,So disappointed!,"I bought five for my family members anticipating a great product from the reviews. So disappointed when one didn't work out of the box,so I programmed the other four and charged them overnight. Proudly presenting one of them to my daughter, I unplugged it to show her all the features and it failed to work at all. Would not even turn on at all when plugged in. I went to another one, same thing. The other two were still working but the FM dial would no longer display. How long before they quit? These are for emergencies and surely can't be counted on. Too bad because it had all the features I was looking for and can't find elsewhere. Very disappointed."
2,Can't recommend,"I was very excited to get this weather radio as it has some really convenient features. It does work really well while it's plugged in; however, anytime I unplug it, all settings are lost. Upon receipt, I read how to charge it for the first time and followed those recommendations. I tried removing the battery, letting it drain completely, recharging again but, it never would retain my location and settings once it was unplugged from the wall. I could redo all the settings with it unplugged and it would retain them when I plugged it back in, but again when I'd unplug it later, say, to go to the basement during a tornado warning, all settings and location were lost. I finally gave it away to GoodWill, box and all with a note saying it works well while plugged in.Still looking for a quality, portable weather radio with similar features."
3,Plate moutning holes too small,"The plate ended up needing slight modification to fit. The screws that came with the mount did not fit through the plate mounting holes. The plate hole needed to be drilled out to enlarge the hole by about 1/16th of an inch to make it work. This was a pain and required the purchase of a drill bit for metal (between $6 and $12).After the modification, the plate worked fine."
4,Nice Read!,"I enjoy Kathryn Smith's books, but I thought this was a bit slow at times. I still recommend that you read all of the books in the series; I believe that they are 4 books in all. Thanks!"
2,The Adjective Western.,"The story of Dave Myatt, the son of a squatter who accidentally shoots and kills the rich rancher who is the only buffer between his hardcase sons and the homesteaders(well duh, sorry about that), we have a molten blue sky, and a morbid whatever, plus sere brown waste and humped foothills and smoltering black eyes, too much, this is a Bantam book but I think would better fit the Harlequin books. Roe Richmond is compared to Ernest Haycox and Luke Short on the back cover, I don't even think so, in fact try one of those gentlemen if you want to read a truly good western/cowboy story."
5,The most interesting true crime book I have read,"This book is not for the squeamish.It was graphically detailed and well written.It was so good,that I have since read four more books about Paul and Karla.This one is by far the best account of the couple."
3,Scary,This book was shocking...really gross at some bits. I was surprised that some ppl would do all that for love. Vivid violence.
2,A Shallow Representation of the Facts,"Nick Pron does a disservice to the families of the victims of the crimes committed by Paul and Karla Bernardo in this book. It is painfully clear that the author believes that Karla Bernardo is a victim of her husband's abuse and continually attempts to justify her actions by using this defense throughout the novel.I was extremely dissappointed in this book although I am sure that somewhere, Karla Bernardo smiles when she thinks of Nick Pron."
4,Vivid account of two very sick individuals and their crimes,"This book was a very fast read, although, if you have a queasy stomach you might want to skip this one. Nick Pron tells the story using actual dialogue from the videotaped rapes. This book is absolutely haunting. I am glad I read it but I feel a tremendous pain for the victims and their families after reading it. It seems a shame that Paul and Karla cannot pay for their crimes with a more fitting punishment."
1,unsure,"I title this review ""unsure"" for I am unsure that such a book should be on the market. I give it only one star for the same reason. Nick Pron is a wonderful writer, but should he have wrote this story.I read the entire book, was sickened by it, and will now be a more protective mother. What worries me is the ""sick minds"" that are also reading this book or other books like it. Those that sickly ""dream"" of such porn may be inspired to act. My copy will not be recycled to the public, but rather burned.My sympathy to the Mahaffy, French, and Homolka families.Too bad Paul & Karla couldn""t receive the dealth penalty.I would like Karla to know that no decent person allows such to happen. You should have contacted the police before Tammy was killed. You should have died trying to save her. You should never be allowed on the streets again."
4,Deadly Innocence,"I agree with some of the other reviews that I've seen on the book--Karla Homolka is NOT a victim!!!! I dont care HOW much a person tries to control another, there's no way that Ill ever believe that Paul Bernardo MADE her do all these things-- I believe she simply loved him that much--- enough to drug and ultimately kill her own baby sister. I thoroughly enjoyed this book--like many others who read it--- I could not put it down!!!! To imagine that these two scum killed a teenage girl just two weeks before their fairytale wedding--- UNBELIEVEABLE!!!"
2,Too brief,Too brief. No real detail. This book did not really get into any of the details surrounding the events regarding the investigation. Just a brief overview of a very tragic case
3,Good book - Really gross though,"I would recommend this book, however, I found it to be ""stomach turning"". I can't believe what people would do for the ""love"" of another and to another human being."
3,Karla is no victim!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I couln't believe how the auther points to Karla Homolka as a victim. She clearly was a cruel selfish sicko from an early age and as an adult was quite aware of the harm she was doing. I'm deeply troubled that she is free to enjoy her, unlike her victims!! This book leaves no details out, it describes the torture and abuse the young ladies suffered in detail. It is so sad and shocking. I do question how the familys of both victims feel about this book being written. I know I wouldn't want so many graphic details being released to the public about my childrens murders."
3,Do not buy from tigerdirect,"Product works ok. But bad design of battery attachment. Batter is heavy and shape is awkward. Further photo display does not look good. Most important thing is Tigerdirect is selling this product through amazon.com. Tigerdirect.com is intentionally selling this product for cheap to attract the customers. I guess this product version is no longer available from manufacturer website. I think this product was manufactured especially for tigerdirect. Thats why, if I want to return this product, they are not accepting. Be careful with tigerdirect return policy. Amazon return policy will be overidden by tigerdirect policy. Why should amazon encourage such merchants?"
1,Not satisfied,I bought this item recently.pros.Cheaper price than other players in marketCons1)Controls on player are not adequate you have to rely on remote control.2)ON/OFF switch is too delicate.3)Player doesn't look solid enough.4)I hardly got 1 hr 50 min of play time on battery charge.
3,very general,"The writing is rather academic and a bit like a lecture. It's sort of like a primer on the topic. It is good in a sense, because it covers issues in a concise format but is not really for a trader"
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,"Well, the title says it all. Its performance is not as good as I expected. I feel like I have to brush many times in order to feel clean. The brush is not as strong as my Oral B one. I am very very disappointed. Sonicare lets me down!!!"
3,Not a winner.,This is one of those great ideas that just didn't work out. Having your toothpaste inside the toothbrush sounds like a life changing novelty but the toothpaste is really expensive and without it the inside of the head gets really gross. Most stores have discontinued selling the heads and the toothpaste for this brush.
3,My kids don't like the toothpaste flavors,"I bought this because I was hoping my kids would brush better. I thought they would like having the toothpaste in the handle, but they don't like either of the flavors of toothpaste and the toothpaste is expensive anyway. I had another regular Sonicare that I've used for years, but it just died and I think I'm going to try Oral-B next because studies I've read says that the oscillating motion of Oral-B removes plaque better that a Sonicare. Our Intelliclean is just sitting there unused right now because I'm not willing to buy more brush heads so that I can use it because I use Tom's of Maine toothpaste--this toothbrush is not worth the extra money."
1,Cleaning issue,"The toothbrush works fine as a toothbrush. However, toothpaste and water drip down and into the cavity where the toothpaste cartridge goes. As a result, if you don't take the toothbrush apart regularly and clean out the compartment, you get a bacteria laden stinky mess. I'm going to get the simpler version which i hope won't have this 'stinking' problem"
4,"Great Product, Great Performance","I have been using an Oral B brush for a few years now and thought it was time to upgrade. My dental hygenist recommended this one so I decided to try it. My teeth feel a lot cleaner and are noticable whiter after only 1 week's use. The integrated toothpaste is good, but I recommend using your regular toothpaste as well (it goes a little faster than advertised.I recommend this product!!!"
2,Mold grows inside the toothpaste dispenser,"I bought this thing a few months ago, it's fine, nothing special, and a little overpriced. The big problem with it (and the reason I no longer use it) is that mold and other disgusting stuff grows on the inside compartment that holds the toothpaste. That can be very disgusting. I decided I rather spend the money to buy a new power brush than keep using this thing.To be fair, I should say that if you clean the inside of the brush every day, maybe you will not have a mold problem.As a final note, I did not notice any significant improvement since I started using this thing, and my dentist did'nt either."
5,IntelliClean,"I can't say how much I like this toothbrush. I had three different Braun brushes before my dentist talked to me about the IntelliClean. I have had this since after Christmas of 2005. Until I started using IntelliClean I had to have my teeth cleaned at the dentist every 4 months. This has been my schedulae for the last 15 or so years. Now I go every 6 months like most other people. Instead of taking an hour at the dentist for cleaning, it takes less than half that time. I would tell anyone and everyone to buy the IntelliClean!!!"
5,Ram Line Synthetic stock,"I had a monte-carlo style stock on my 7400 and with the cheek piece,was too tall.The Ram Line is a straight stock and works perfect with my peep sights."
2,Where's the Essence?,"Being a BIG Maynard Ferguson fan, from the old days of the MF Horns albums, I have to question why they chose these songs for a ""Greatest Hits"" collection. No matter what the previous reviewer stated, Rocky and Gospel John are not included here. If they were then this might collectable. With the exceptions of Birdland and maybe MacArthur's Park most of these selections would not be considered his most popular. It would be understandable if this had been released in the mid 1970's but it came out in 1993. Believe me, Maynard has much better music than this. If you're looking for the ""Classic"" Maynard sound, try Chameleon. If you're looking for a great Jazz/Swing set, try These Cats can Swing. This should only be considered if you're looking for some of his lesser known works."
4,We Love G.I. Joe!,This is an awesome toy! It's lots of fun to play with! It's always been one of my favorites! It is more than worth what you pay for it.
5,The only book you need to get started in XML,"In order to keep my precarious web development job, I decided to learn XML - everyone's been talking about it for a while. As I usually do when I need to learn a new subject, I buy about a half dozen books on the subject. This book was one of those half-dozen. Suffice it to say that I returned the other five. Seriously, it's that good. It assumes nothing about your prior knowledge, and takes you step-by-step from simple XML into DTDs, XML Schema, XSLT, XHTML, and more. The content is solid and the writing style is friendly, conversational, and intelligent."
3,"Starts strong, then fades into incomprehension","Could have been good or even great. It starts clear, correct, and well-structured. Then about a third of the way through the book (which is really half the content because the last third is an absolete printing of the XML spec) the writing gets lazy. Comprehending the material becomes an absolute chore as all structure is lost.The first part is the best intro to XML that I've read, but it's just an intro."
1,"Try something else, this dog won't hunt.","The book starts out nicely explaining everything and it gets you motivated. From chapter 3 onwards, 19 pages later, its all guess work. He gives pieces of information with no coherent example that shows how all these pieces fit together. Its left up to your imagination to guess how it all comes together. Once more, I had to go back to internet tutorials (which I have found to be way better than a lot of computer programming books). XML is not rocket science. If you can't write a descent book about it, you ought to think about quiting the writing profession (stick to writing code). This was a waste of my time and money; needless to say a waste of paper and ink too."
2,A disappointing journey into the human condition.,"While traveling with the author through locales, both physical and metaphysical, the book overreaches in its attempts to know and celebrate the soft, vulnerable underside of the human condition. Shared experiences that might have felt authentic and profound if conveyed, perhaps, with a lighter touch straddle the maudlin; being saccharin and preachy when sweetness and insight are just out of reach. The author's conspicuous omission of any reference to his first marriage and children further undermines his credibility as a bearer of genuine soul and seeker of truth."
4,passion and beauty,"I've just discovered an important new writer -- Anthony Maulucci. These stories are simply wonderful! He writes with passion and beauty. He captures the subtleties of the modern psyche in stories that are so well put together they stand like marble sculptures. I don't care for a lot of contemporary fiction -- it reads like it came off an assembly line and it has all the passion of a styrofoam cup. These stories have real substance, although there are two that just didn't have the power of the others and should probably not have been included. But overall this is an excellent collection, well worth the money because you will enjoy them more and more each time you read them."
4,Gentle Irony,"From the first paragraphs, I'm drawn in completely, transported to any number of locales and introduced to couples and characters that seem both vaguely familiar and singularly unique. These short stories are gently steeped in irony. O. Henry for the 21st Century?"
5,Well-liked by Green Cheek Conure,"Harrison's is always on the avian vets' ""short list"" for quality pellets. Quality pellets are only beneficial though, if the bird will actually eat them. My Green Cheek Conure really likes Harrison's Pepper Lifetime Coarse. Although the pellets are larger than I would have thought he would like, he actually prefers this size, as he can hold a pellet in his foot and munch on it that way. He seems to like the spice too. Sometimes I moisten the pellets and heat for 5-10 seconds in the microwave. Just a word of advice-- the best price for this product (that I've encountered) is at [...]. (Just put all of that together.) It's not THAT much less, but depending on where you live (and shipping), you save a few dollars per bag, which adds up over time."
2,My bird wouldn't touch it,"In contrast to other reviews my bird (Caique parrot) will not eat this. He will however, eat ""Harrisons Power Treats"" instead. Perhaps he doesn't like the pepper flavor?I would recommend trying Power Treats instead."
1,Crap on a Disc,"Zaiko Langa Langa is a great band but this is a terrible album. It is pieces of songs, cut into 3 minute chunks. Just as the band prepares to shift gears, the song abruptly ends and another piece of a different song starts. It's like listening to the samples on Amazon. (Do you really believe ZLL has one and a half minute songs?)Buy their classicZaire-Ghana. If you already have that then save up your money and buy one of the over-priced used copies of another album."
4,A wonderful read,"I enjoyed this fast-moving easy reading novel. It takes you back to a different era when life was simple and people were willing to work hard for what they got out of life. The author's style reminds me of the Little House on the Prairie series by Laura Ingells Wilder that I read as a child in school (very descriptive and very enlightening). It was a delightful, wonderful read."
5,My cat loves it !,"My cat loves it. But, why should he have all the fun. Now I wear it. If I ever get lost when I get Alzheimers, the police will return me safely to wherever I'm at. Where AM I at anyway ?"
5,Loved by cats and humans,"My cats and I love these collars. They are unobtrusive enough that my most finicky cat does not seem to be bothered by it, and I haven't had any problems with their hair matting or anything like that. These collars break away easily enough, but I haven't had problems with them breaking away needlessly around the house - we have only lost one so far after using these collars for four years.Bonus: no bells! I hate that most other cat collars come with bells attached, which I then have to pry off with pliers. These hold an ID tag perfectly, and that's all we need!"
1,Clasp broke right away.,"I love how slim these collars are, but I put the collar on my cat after the clasp on the one she was wearing broke. She was sleeping on my bed when I put it on her. 10 minutes later, I noticed that the collar had come off, and lo and behold - it was because the plastic had broken. She wasn't even doing any crazy cat acrobatics.I ordered the kind that has no plastic clasp directly from the manufacturer and would give that 5 stars."
2,a false image of indian life,i felt this book had a false image of true indian life. it gave only negative images.
3,Alexander the Great is So-So,"We were looking forward to playing Alexander the Great with our son, since he's named after the great leader. We are huge fans of Settlers of Catan and thought this might be in the same vein. It's not. It's an interesting game, but we just haven't enjoyed it too much. It seems to be a mixture of Settlers and Risk. Both of which are excellent games in their own right. It just doesn't seem as engaging as the other 2 games. Definitely more of a conquering game, vs a trading game."
2,A fairly weak introductory game to Eurogames,"This game is basically weak. Hoiwever, game components are well made, mapboard is beautiful and five players can play it. It's fast (75 minutes) and at the least you'll learn something about the geographic regions that Alexander travelled when going to conquer.There is strategic thinking, but not one that will overwhelm you and delay the game.The game is not particularly exciting, but this does not make it not fun to play.I recommend it if you wanna a fast gateway game to Eurogames. But in my experience it is better with the full five players."
1,"Weak In Contrast to ""Ray of Light""","This one's a loser. It won't satisfy her old fans and is a major disappointment to fans (like me) of her ""Ray of Light"" effort. The songs with her new French producer are over-processed, uninvolving and passionless (how many of those are real words?)."
1,Is This Really Music?,"As a fans of Madonna for over 10+ years, this album is a major let-down and total disappointment. No wonder the pile of CDs at the used store is just as high. I guess people either it love it or hate it. People applause for what they call ""re-direction"", ""re-invention"", .... let just say that expectation and values of music have changed. The album is a total sound manipulation. Bunch of noise that you can't really hear what is being sung. The lyrics are cliched and boring. ""Music"" seems to be the best piece of the album and the rest is just fillers."
2,Music - A HUGE letdown,"I was really looking forward to a new M cd.. Especially since it was supposed to be a return to her ""dance"" roots, etc. Unfortunately the album really lacks after about the 2nd to 3rd track. And although you can really hear W.Orbit's contribution (a good thing), M's vocals are waaay to high in the mix. I really liked Ray of Light (4.75 of 5) [and erotica] and was hoping that this cd would musically be in that direction again. It totally fails. I kept hearing that this would be a return to her dance roots, etc. I simply didn't hear it.In summary: Save your money; sadly, the CD is a total letdown."
2,Very Disappointed,"This CD leaves alot to be desired. Even the choice of photography on the sleeve misses the boat. Madonna looks beautiful but the choices are strange. I bought the CD hoping to use it in my dance class. The first cut, ""Music"" is fun and the second has a good beat. There is one beautiful ballad. The rest of the ballads are repetitive and unmoving. Overall, it is nothing special. No significant lyrics. No catchy tunes. No profound message. No really great dance tunes. A let down after ""Ray of Light"" which was really well done. I expected alot more from Madonna. It was like a quickie in the interim while she does her life."
4,Another hit album,"Madonna has produced another hit album and it shows that the queen of pop is going to retain her throne for a long time to come. Featuring the number one single Music and the fantastic current single Tell Me which is my personal favourite, Madonna shows that she has managed to progress with the times without losing her own personal touch."
5,"Shut up Britney, Madonna Did It Again","I can say a few things about this record. There is one thing that really sticks out in my mind, and it's consistency. Every song on this record is good enough to be on the radio. All the songs have something to offer. Whether it's vocal distortions or vocal rawness it just comes out beautifully.Madonna has really upped the ante here. She took what she was experimenting with in ""Ray of Light"" and kicked it into a higher gear than before. There was no reinvention here, just plain old evolution into something better.Most notable tracks: ""Impressive Instant"" ""What it Feels Like for a Girl"" ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""Runaway Lover""."
1,"Sorry, Ray of Light is much better","I was surprised to find this album particularly shallow in lyrics. The electronica/techno sounds were harsh and irritating as well - much different than the grace and harmony of the Ray of Light album. For anyone who does not own Ray of Light, I highly recommend it. For anyone thinking about purchasing Music, listen to it first - don't purchase it just because it's Madonna. Madonna's Ray of Light is rich in lyrical depth/meaning and filled with a beautiful tapestry of sound. Music, to contrast once again, just doesn't leave a good feeling with its empty lyrics and annoying 'harmony'."
2,What was Madonna thinking?,"Okay, I've totally loved everything Madonna has done up todate. Ray of Light was an awesome CD. Erotica was great. And we'llbe listening to her 80's songs for many years to come. But I'm verydisappointed with Music. The only tracks that I enjoyed are Music,Impressive Instant and Runaway Lover, but only because they have agood beat. The rest of the tracks are really lacking in anysubstance. Nothing impressive with either vocals or the music. I'mreally disappointed when Madonna goes from a great album like Ray ofLight and then brings out this CD. CD's like this are the reasonNapster is out there...so I can listen to all the songs and see thatthere are only 3 good tracks out of 10, I wouldn't have wasted the[money]."
4,"""Take the black off the crow but don't tell me i have to go...""","Madonna's Music album is a good, solid effort but some of the tracks I am not too wild about such as Paradise, Nobody's Perfect, and Impressive Instant(this song sounds much better on her Drowned World Tour DVD). The rest of the songs I love, Don't tell me is a classic, Gone is real and honest, Music is a fun dance song very early Madonna, I Deserve It, defintely about her hubby Guy Ritchie, Amazing is just that amazing! Runaway Lover is produced by William Orbit, and the best song on the record is What it feels like for a Girl, at first listen I was hooked:""Hurt that's not supposed to show and tears that fall when no one knows..."" Music is a nice try but I prefer Ray of Light, American Life, and Like A Prayer, more stronger albums."
3,Disappointed fan,"Well, I bought the CD the day it came out, but I am not impressed. It is only 44minutes 40seconds long, which is crime when most CDs today regularly reach to 60 or 70 minutes. The other reviewers must have REALLY been listening to the music to hear the words they claim she sings, because there's no lyrics included in the package. Though, individually, some songs do stand out as interesting, the whole album is disjointed, lacking a central theme or character. Not that every CD has to be a cohesive statement, but, coming from someone who is so adept at making statements, this is somewhat of a mystery. Next time, I'll wait for the reviews to come out, or I'll buy it used."
4,Madonna MUSIC Mania!,"Madonna captures an 'impressive instant' with the release of this new compilation of the latest futuristic sounding electronic club music. She collaborates with French DJ Mirwais Ahmadzai in producing most of the album's tracks. William Orbit plays a minor role this time round but his influence still lingers as there are 3 tracks in the cd to his credit in producing. My personal favorite would be ""I Deserve It"" which features Madonna's unadorned natural singing voice, kind of like unplugged, amidst electronic squiggles. It also sounds a bit like a country song to me.This cd is definitelymore club friendly than her previous ""Ray of Light"", which was more introspective and mystical in nature. Will this album define the music of the future? Let us see."
1,SHE HAS NO VOICE - CELINE DION IS BETTER,"Sorry, but Celine Dion is a much better singer, the last song in which she was trying to sing in french may be she have heard Celine singing in her native french and wanted to copy her. Celine sings the good french though, not no syllable by syllable sing along. and I recommend her album anyday than tacky madonna. Lets start by criticising the songs. The first one is what you say....Je ne se quoi. Oh baby you should have heard Celine intonation in french to compare. Ok then , the next, Madonna must know she cant compare with the real diva Celine. I think she tries to copy her in the emotives , but it dont come through, sorry madonna. I hate to say it but the seemingly crayon color picture on cover. Its too brite and shiny. Now back to the music, put it this way, shes no Celine and cant ever ever ever profess to be!"
3,"Good, but not her best...","Madonna's new CD ""Music"" has a distinct dance mix to it, but in my opinion she tries a little too hard in achieving too many styles of Musical Overture."
5,Ear Candy!,"Love the originality of this music. Because she is ever-changing, Madonna is never boring. ""Music"" makes you want to dance - totally energizing! Wish the ""Music"" video was half as impressive as this work of art."
3,Could have been more MUSIC,"Like most Madonna fans I was awaiting the next album. My first reaction was, there is only 10 tracks? I would have liked at least a couple more. I did like a few of them, and some may grow on me. I hope a few more are made into videos. I guess I like it enough, but nothing really made me go WOW!!!! If you are a madonna fan you will buy this regardless, but if not dont hurry. Given time I may change my mind, but right now I am only saying PLEASE MADONNA DONT WAIT TOO LONG FOR THE NEXT ALBUM! WE NEED MORE MUSIC!"
1,This stuff has been done already.,"I don't think she's the innovator that everyone is making her out to be. Look at this stuff on the album, it's all retro stuff that's been done a million times before. I bet she even hyped up the electronica thing, cause people said there was a hint of it in Ray of light album. So she went with it. So what's new about synthesizer and voice over samples...duh. And what's new about her Patsy Cline look-a-like cowgirl outfit. She's funny in it actually."
4,What it feels like for a girl!,"Great album! Madonna shows again her beauty again-not only in her outward appearance! She isstill one of the queens of pop and gives usan exciting example how different musicinfluences work on the same album.""Music"" is one of the singles and is able torock the dancefloors with an electrobeat.""What it feels like for a girl"" is the bestsingle from this album which shows howsensible (surely not only...) girls can beand how far emotional things can go andfollow you. The song after this is ""Paradise""which shows that the love that you searchcannot always be given as you wish it fromthe bottom of your heart (""...your paradisewas not for me!""). ""Nobody is perfect"" is a greatsong too which underlines the feeling of unhappylove and how you can break under someone's expectationsagainst you to be an ideal. ""American Pie"" is a singlewhich was covered by a classic. The other songs onthis album are nearly all good. It is a mixtureof dreaming sounds, ballads and dancefloor.Buy it!"
5,Madonna Does It Yet Once Again,"""Music"" is a dance classic!!! Madonna is an example, to all of the young wannabe's & carbon cut-outs of todays music industry, of what good pop music (& videos) is all about. ""Tell Me"" is such a beautiful song that is highly overlooked and should have been nominated for a Grammy. It's wonderful to see that after all these years Madonna still has it in her and is as hip as when she first came out. Not many artists can claim that."
2,Not that great!,"I wasn't a big fan of this album when it came out. I remember renting(library had huge cd collections) and thinking it wasn't really that great. Music was kind of ugh? I was like it's ok but way too overplayed. Don't tell me was the only song i really liked,but didn't get to hear enough of on the radio. Other then that I thought runway lover was decent. i thought what it feels like for a girl was pretty lame and boring. She doesnt have great vocals so for me it wasn't that great. I would skip this cd. It's def. not her best. She really should have gone in more of a kylie minogue direction."
3,Man of great importance,"As you should know I am a man of great importance, especialy in bussiness. My rates only go up. I'll only tell my driver Jan to sell my stocks when I've got full foreknowledge. Madonna should do the same. With the position I have in dayly live, it may be easier to know what I'm talking about than for a little girl that couldn't finish her lessons at musicschool with the mean triangle-wich (at least that's what the people in high society in England are wispering).When I see my bussiness opponent Walter Woodstock standing on the footpath I always let my butler open the door. Walter never knows what's hit him. And he never knows where it's coming from, because I change my style of cars a lot. Just like Madonna's music: it hits, you just can't decide in wich way. And you never know where it's coming from, exept when you're in command of bussiness, like me and Madonna."
2,"Face it , the tunes aren't there","Madonna wannabees give anything she does five stars including the dismal 'Bedtime Stories' & the Dick Tracy songs and they've mostly done it again here. This is seamlessly produced by techno-meisters Mirwais Ahmadzai & William Orbit but with about two exceptions, you find yourself fast forwarding, which is sad after such a triumph as 'Ray of Light'. On that album and her previous ones, the tunes penned by Pat Leonard were the best, but long-time collaborator Leonard is absent on this album, and no amount of high-tech wizardry can disguise the lack of a good tune."
4,Madonna Electronica,"The only reason why I gave this Cd 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the track ""Nobody's Perfect"", it seems like it's missing something. Other than that, I love the whole mood of the album. Some of the key tracks are ""Music"", ""Don't Tell Me"", ""I Deserve It"", ""Paradise"" and I love the quirky, highschool-ish sound of ""Amazing"". This was Madonna's new millennium Cd."
4,Music Never Sounded Better,"I bought this album the week it went on sale (as every Madonna fan did), and I loved it! In my opinion, it is one of Madonna's best albums, and definitely a breath of fresh air after listening to Ray Of Light. Ray Of Light was great, but Music is fun!"
3,INTRIGUING.....,"I'm a huge Madonna fan....but this doesn't tickle my fancy. It's very creative and intresting,but I enjoy the late-80's Madonna more than this. This does have its classics. The #1 hit from last year ""Music"" is a great groove track and opens up the CD with a bang. Then we have the 2nd single ""Don't Tell Me"" which was a huge top ten hit in the US and I love it and its beat. And the 3rd single ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"" is my personal fave. It was a top 40 hit in the US and its message is great and so are Madonna's vocals. ""Amazing"" and ""I Deserve It"" are also great tracks. But ""Impressive Instant"" really turned me off. I mean,for someone who likes techno and electronic music,it's probably great...but it's just too strange for my musical tastes. So,it's a good album,but I reccomend ""Something To Remember"" and ""The Immaculate Collection."" Those are REALLY worth the money."
4,Pure Pleaser,"Combining Madonna's sharp songwriting capabilities with Mirwais's rough french electronica landscapes, the 10 song ""Music"" easily pleases the ear. It is a dance record in the best sense. Madonna keeps the lyrics minimal and playful, while Mirwais keeps it bumping.Highlights include the popular ""Music"", ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""Nobody's Perfect""."
2,What is this?,"This is just horrible..first I have to say I feel really jipped by this album only having 10 songs...not to mention that almost all the songs are bad. Madonna doesn't even sing on this CD, a computer does.The only good songs are the singles. And you've heard those...""Don't Tell Me"" being the best one."
3,IT'S All Right,"Not one of her better CD's, but I have been supporting her over the years. I'm into the funk, nothing but. If you want to here a real funk artist, blow you out the water with the baddest funk hooks you ever danced and grooved to, Madonna check out The Bride of All Thangs Funky, Dawn Silva on amazon.com Link this ladie up with the other Diva's, SILVA's funk will blow them all out the water!!"
2,Madonna/Music - Disappointing,"Madonna's latest CD, Music, is not what I was hoping for. There are only two songs that I really, really like...Music and What It Feels Like For A Girl. I like Music because it's a clubby dance song. I like What It Feels... because the music and tone are reminiscent of Rain...one of my favorite Madonna songs. Both songs reflect Madonna's Material Girl style.The rest of the songs are a little too ""Spanish-guitary"" and folksy for me...as if she's being experimental, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, I haven't listened to Madonna's previous albums (Ray Of Light & ) so I don't know if these songs are actually indicative of her current style. But as I mentioned, I prefer her clubby dance hits, which may no longer be her music focus.So for me, this is a CD with 2 great songs and 8 not so good songs."
3,A lot of house music here,"More techo than ""Ray Of Light"", and this has an intense house feel. There are a few ballads without any throbbing dance music, like ""I Deserve It"" and ""Nobody's Perfect"", but they are unremarkable. And since I don't really like house music, and didn't especially like ""Ray Of Light"", it's hard to judge this. Just be aware that this is not the same Madonna of ""Bedtime Stories"" and ""Vogue""."
1,"Follower, not a leader.","Madonna is one of the most over-rated rated artists of our generation. This album, particularly more than any others, is relective of her ability to manipulate and control the public (and surprisingly the critics) into thinking that what she's doing is actually progressive. From the over-done ""Hey Mr. DJ..."" line, to the played-out cowboy hat she wears on the cover, this album is nothing more than a standard, watered down, dance album. I can't fault her tyrranical business sense, as it has certainly paid off, but I can fault the quality of the product she gets so praised for. Madonna is a follower of trends, not one who sets them. Every aspect of this album, from its packaging to the content, is a direct lift from an underground dance scene that pioneered these sounds and images. And Madonna gets credit for it. Go figure."
2,Madonna returns to her white-trash roots,"After her brief stint in spirituality, Madonna returns with a vengeance to her familiar white trash roots, a genre in which she is more familair. The usual melodic-less throw ups abound. She returns what she is most famous for; empty ,meaningless, cringing, mindless lyrics.I think there was one song that was good on here, and that's saying alot. Stay away from this one folks. And Madge, lose the bucket hat."
2,"Oh, it's a comedy record! Well, then, throw on another star!","In which Madonna -- between trans-Atlantic hair color appointments -- phones in some half-hearted vocals and sub-first draft lyrics and then instructs her record company to hire some producers-du-jour to make it all sound like Tupac and Roger's ""California Love."" Silliest tricks: She slathers on lots of vocoder effects because Cher won that Grammy and raps in French because dating that English movie guy and hanging out with Rupert make her more European. High-points: The hysterically funny string of lyrical cliches in ""I Deserve It"" makes you think of Survivor (the band, not the TV show) and the annoying digital tomfoolery on ""Don't Tell Me"" makes you take out the cd to see if it's scratched. And then there's the sound of the dentist's drill on ""Gone"" that both pays homage to ""Marathon Man"" and wakes you up to let you know the album's over. Best idea: She borrows Patsy Cline's wardrobe."
3,Too Much Electronic in here,"Have you ever gotten the impression something is ok but could definitely have been better?This album to me is the demonstration...MUSIC is a great dance track.DON'T TELL ME shows once again the genius in the lady in bringing together the cowboy theme and the electronic stuff.WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL is a splendid ballad built up on synthsizers.GONE is so emotioonally charged that you can't help but fall in love with it.PARADISE NOT FOR ME is very dark and haunting, beautiful as FROZEN.It's the rest of the album i cannot relate to...the voxcoder is used even more than with Cher! The electronica pours out of the CD in tons...some acoustic guitars are not enough.The woman has talent and likes to change and try different styles.I really hope the next one will be something that will take the world by surprise once again...maybe country or rock?That would be a real knockout!"
4,"Gotta love ""Mo"".....","Any album releases by Madonna is always a must have in anyones collection. Madonna is like a chameleon always changing and a step ahead in her approach towards her music. Madonna shocked everyone with her fabu take on electronica in ""Ray Of Light"". As for her latest release ""Music"" Madonna , I still love her dearly but the vibe on ""Music"" is WAAAY to mellow here. There is some good songs on the album including ""What It Feels Like For A Girl.."" and ""Dont Tell Me"". But thumbs down on the tracks ""Nobodys Perfect""....aacckkk!! Madonna sounds like she is being strangled...ick!!!!..."
4,better than ray of light,"Even though Music is a little reminiscent of Ray of Light (of which I'm not the biggest fan), I'm very pleased with Music. The Mirwais-produced songs such as the title track and Impressive Instant are clearly the highlights, with bouncy dancefloor-ready beats. The French producer filters Madonna's voice through everything but a Cuisinart. The William Orbit-produced tracks sound like Ray of Light leftovers. Though not on par with Like a Prayer or Erotica, Music is a fine effort from a living legend."
2,Oh dear....,"Dissapointing. None of the songs on here are 'classic' material, and wont be remembered like her songs such as Vogue and Like a prayer. I know music in general is bad at the moment, but i was hoping Madonna would try and save it for us, nope! Still theres no harm in experimenting. Maybe she'll get up to scratch with her next album. Dont get me wrong this is not a really bad album, but by Madonnas standard it is bland, some of the songs are quite funky and by todays music standards, its great. But in 20 years time, noeone will care about these songs, but people will still be loving Like a prayer and Vogue. Maybe im the only 14 year old who realises how mediocre music is at the moment, but im not ashamed to be in the minority...."
5,"A BIG HIT FROM THE BIG ""M!""","I recently baught this album and the only word that can come close to describing it is superb! This has to be one of the most fantastic peaces of art Madonna has put together in her amazing recording career! The ""Music"" on this album is so diverse it makes you wonder if all the songs are by the same artist. Songs range from hard techno songs like ""Impressive Instant"" to the stripped down ""I deserve It"" where Madonna sings with guitar! Of course you can also expect the out there plane old pop like the song ""Amazing"" which it is!"
2,Not fun at all,"The single ""Music"" is great -- the kind of song Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder would have done together, if they were still together. Other than one other terrific track -- ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"" -- the rest of the album is a sonically adventurous but monotonous experience. And worse, the lyrics are generally pretentious and/or embarassing. And she should not recite poetry -- ever. Other than the aforementioned songs, there's nothing here that matches the exhilarating fun of her recent great singles ""Ray of Light"" or ""Beautiful Stranger"" (which she rehashes to lesser advantage here.) She may not have a great or even decent voice, but she usually has great producers with great pop instincts that make the records sound great. They fail her here. She has the best publicists on the planet, but I will be surprised if this catches on beyond the initial flurry."
1,One word... ewwwwwwwwwww,"Normally I try to show positive points over artists when I review, but the only positive point is the title song, ""Music"". But even that gets boring after a while. This album just plain sucks. I can't believe she can go so far as to use French beats and so many techno bleeps that you can't hear her voice. Please. It's clear that this album needs to be buriedSIX FEET UNDER!! Madonna, if you read this, I'm sorry I have to diss your album so much. I love your last CD, but this is too much! Maybe you misunderstood our plea, but for heaven's sake, we don't need a material girl; we need new material!!!"
3,"bad ""Material Girl""","Well, i hate to say it, but Madonna is running out of material. The few nice things I can say about the album is its different, original, and distracting at best. Seems like shes using effects to extend her ""talents"" which is interesting, but not necessarily a good thing. Hopefully she will go back to making pure music again."
3,"Dissappionting ""Music"" From Madonna","I happen to be a HUGE Madonna fan, so it hurts to give this album only 3 stars, but I rate on quality. Madonna's latest is not very good. The only songs I really liked were the title track, ""Impressive Instant"" and ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"". The song that I COULD NOT STAND was ""Paradise (Not For Me)"". Maybe it was the new producer (Mirwais) that I did not like about this album, maybe the ballad-like songs dragged it down (such as ""I Deserve It"" and ""Nobody's Perfect""). All I know is that ""Ray Of Light"" was a far more superior CD than this drivel. Madonna's gonna have to do better than this next time. I feel her fans were shafted. This ""Music"" could've been better."
2,Unmusical,"The songs that are heard on the radio are great, but the rest are really in poor taste. They are short and not well written. It was like she went through a rhyming dictionary just to make her songs rhyme. Buy the singles, but don't waste your money on this one, it definitely doesn't come close to her past albums."
5,Short & Sweet,"""Music"" is a terrific song worthy of tons of awards and more noteriety than it has been getting lately. The new Madonna Album deserves Grammys, MTV moonmen and every other possible award. Madonna knows just how to make albums. Not too peppy, not too mellow, but somewhere in the middle. You go girl!"
2,Agree with Sean from Boston,"I bought Madonna's latest today and listened to it through headphones at work. All the beeping and chirping and cheesy voice effects gave me a headache. Maybe I just need to let it sink in after a few more listens. But I couldn't even pick out a logical follow-up single to ""Music"". Nothing grabbed me as being the next big hit off this album.I still giver her credit though for the longevity of her career. But at this point in time, the last thing she should be doing is sounding like a tired Cher song."
3,OK but not memorable,"Music is better than the crap the teeny boppers are cranking out but that standard is so low that this accomplishment isn't saying much. Most of The vocal effects on this CD are dumb and the majority of the lyrics are run of the mill pop. The exception being What It Feels Like for a Girl. The songwriting is great on that one as is the instrumentation and vocal arrangements. Low points are the cornball ballad Paradise is not For Me, which is a shame because this is the only song where the vocal dub effect works beautifully. Too bad she didn't sing all the lyrics except the chorus in French, that way the bad song writing wouldn't get in the way of such fun orchestration. Amazing is another cool track. A better retread of Beautiful Stranger, which in my humble opinion sucked due to the lazy song writing. I like all the folk songs, but being a fan of Suzanna Vega and such Madonna's lyrics just don't measure up. This album is OK but not a keeper."
3,Huh? That Madonna?,"Madonna never ceased to amaze me. I was never a pop listener type of guy, I hate boy bands, I do not like Spears or Christina. Madonna however, is an exception. With her some hundred images, she brings out this CD which is more like Ray of Light, showing the spiritual side of Madonna. This CD is a bit like that, but more fun/unrestrained/techno style. I gave it three stars because most of the tracks on the CD are lame, not catchy, and plain dumb."
2,A far cry from Ray of Light,"I really thought Madonna was beginning to mature and have some insight into the higher nature of things. However, this album and the ones that followed were all regressions. She still seems to have retained her crudeness (or is that cruelness) in flipping off random people for no apparent reason. Her sense of entitlement is a far cry from enlightenment.Go back to the drawing board Madonna until you get it right."
5,One of Madonna's best albums...,"""Music"" is without a doubt, one of Madonna's best albums (Along with ""Like A Prayer"", ""Erotica"", and ""Ray of Light"") she has ever recorded. After listening to it over and over again, I can honestly say that I have not gotten tired of it at all. The standout tracks on the album are ""Music"", ""Impressive Instant"", ""I Deserve It"", ""Don't Tell Me"", ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"", and ""Gone"" (at least in my opinion). The rest of the songs are really good too. There is not a song on this album, that is actually bad. This CD makes a great birthday/holiday gift. If you don't own it already...BUY IT!"
2,She gets 2 for Bravery...,"Wow, I am scared. Madonna's ""Music"" simply shows her arrogance even more then it has been seen before. She thinks that she can pull of French disco beats. Well, I'm really sorry Madonna, but you can't! This CD is so weird, it's scary. Madonna is a complete psycho, who should realize that she is too out of it to keep up with today's music world. Next we'll be seeing her getting her groove on with Nelly or something. Everyone always likes to talk about Madonna ""reinventing herself in such a unique way"", but when you think about it, all she does is go along with a certain bizarre trend that has caught on at the moment, all the while thinking she is the coolest thing since sliced bread. Get over yourself Madonna, because you bite. I give you two stars for throwing yourself to the dogs with this new, hideous representation of what we are to call music. MADONNA IS DISGUSTING."
1,Madonnas Worst,I have every CD Madonna has released. Liked every on of them except her new release. The CD gets started good with Music which is the only good song on her CD. It goes down hill from there. Its boring and no fun. In fact this is one of the worst CD's I own. This CD dosnt even come close to her previous release Ray of Light one of her best. Im disappointed I bought this CD.
1,another piece of electronic noise,This cd is the latest example of an artist that believes the studio is greater than a simple intelligent vocal.This is a mass market venture..again..
3,Reedited this album would have been ok.,"I was still reeling from the epic RAY OF LIGHT when this one came out. When I heardMUSIC I flipped for the single,it was vintage dancefloor ""EVERYBODY"" MADONNA. i suspected that this album was going to have retreads into familiar grooves from her. Yes and no. This album comes across specifically designed for the current ADD MTV generation. It's not bad but it's very choppy,she fails to make one sound out of many actually it's very akin to True Blue in that sense. There are three clunkers here. At number one NOBODY'S PERFECT, this trite simplistic excercise in vocoder torture will have your head exploding like the martians in MARS ATTACKS. The constipated RUNAWAY LOVER sounds like a bside remix from EROTICA. PARADISE(not for me) drones on and on and were treated to some lame pretentious French lyrics when she runs out of ideas in English. The rest of the tracks stand well on their own,she should of re-edited the track list and re-named the album SINGLES."
5,Music... Makes The People... Come Together,"This is such a great CD. It is the first Madonna CD that I ever owned! It's better than AMERICAN LIFE, but not as good as RAY OF LIGHT. I really like teh songs MUSIC, RUNAWAY LOVER, and DON'T TELL ME. Music is a fun dancy tune. Runaway Lover is just a great song. And Don't Tell Me is awesome. I knew it would be a huge hit the second I listened to it. The rest of the CD is really good, too! It goes into more of a slow more depressing mood than the very upbeat Ray Of Light CD. Nonetheless, this CD rocks. It's so good. I recommend it to everyone. I know you'll like it. ENJOY!!!!!"
3,Long live the queen,"I love Don't Tell Me. The way the acoustic intro skips and stops was something I had not heard before. My knowledge of spinmaster effects however is limited and some other DJ might have laid down a similar groove but just never the mind. This song kicks! The title song is also strong and should be enjoyed loudly. The reason only three stars---there are only 2 other songs that are very good. The rest don't groove as well and have some lyrics that truly identify this as a release for the current teen pocketbook. Still, over the years Madonna has come prepared and this latest effort is worth the money. Even if you can't last through the whole CD in one listen."
2,Madonna has dissapointed,"I always seemed to like Madonna... until this album. No, I hadn't bought any of her albums, but I liked what was played on the radio for its upbeat sound and realitive creativity.However, after buying this album, I see that Madonna, sadly, has little creativity indeed. The lyrics, bland and corny, provoke no interesting thoughts, and the beat nothing but a little light techno. Too bad."
3,"Expected More from Madonna! ""Hey Mr. DJ"" Taken from Another?","Not a bad cd! Madonna's first album, ""Madonna"" from 1982-1983 was more inspirational! Madonna's best work to date is ""Like a Prayer"" and ""Ray of Light"". Her most creative is ""Erotica"" with hit singles as ""Deeper and Deeper"" and ""Rain"". However ""Music"" lacked the ""Madonna"" creativity and innovation. I was hoping that ""Music"" would come with more force than ""Ray of Light"". The ""Hey Mr. DJ"" phrase from the ""Music"" single seemed to be stolen from Sweden's The Army of Lover's ""Hey Mr. DJ"". There seems to be some similarities in the rhythms but a nicer use of synthesizers in the latter. If you want great dance music with a unique combination of new wave, synthesizers, pop, exciting rhythms and fun, try ""Army of Lovers""."
2,very techno,"I love the first song and several of the others songs are not bad. Some songs are bad. Bad lyriks, irritating techno sounds."
4,Tightrope walking,"This is a step sideways--not forward--for Madonna, given the tremendous success of 'Ray of Light.' Once again, she's taking a tried and true path and only marginally messing with the formula that made her previous release so popular, by taking leaves from Cher and Daft Punk, and signing William Orbit once again as the producer.'Music' certainly sounds like leftover sessions from 'Ray of Light', but it needn't take any truck from hardcore fans (if there are any left), as it's got less filler than that album. ""Impressive Instant"", ""What it Feels Like for a Girl"", the title track, ""Paradise"", and ""Gone"" are all strong choices for singles, and the copy I picked up came with a bonus VCD of remixes and the 'What it Feels...' video.Even without this extra freebie, it's still worth picking up."
3,Madonna tries too hard on MUSIC,"When the single ""music"" was first released I thought it was a great piece of dance music. It was upbeat, fun, and sonically satisifying. The album MUSIC however is not so good. First, Madonna's voice is now a computer and every song tries way too hard to be electroic. MUSIC is a split between electronica, dance, and folk. The ballads ""i deserve it"" and ""gone"" show Madonna as never before, as a folk singer. She actually shows some emotion on those and ""what it feels like for a girl"" is nicely written and produced. As a whole, MUSIC lacks the emotion, excitement, and fun that a pop album should have. It is innovative and different but most of the songs don't flow. Duds like ""impressive instant"" and ""runaway lover"" try much too hard to impress. Aside from ""music"" and ""don't tell me"", MUSIC fizzles out and is easily forgettable."
3,"Madonna's ""Music"" rather disappointing....","Now, Madonna is one of the most famous people on the planet, as well as one of the most talented. I bought the album after my friends gave it rave reviews. However, when I listened to it, I was thoroughly disappointed. In my eyes, the only truly worthy songs on the album are ""Music"" and ""Don't Tell Me"". All the others are very poppy, very light and non-consequential.Even so, Madonna's album is great for all of those disco fans! As my mom said, it was as if you stepped right back into a disco in the 60's and 70's, and she uses LOTS and LOTS of synthesizer.True-blue Madonna and pop fans would love the album, and part of the reason I'm giving it a 3 is because, after all, she IS Madonna!"
4,A career that just gets better ... and better ... and better,"To me, Madonna is one of the most interesting and talented artists out there. A woman who continously re-invents herself in music, style and appearance. Album after album we see a new Madonna. Sure, she has had a few disappointing albums (eg. I'm Breathless/Dick Tracey Soundtrack, and perhaps Bedtime Stories but one could argue that they were all part of an incredible journey. This album continues Madonna move into a more mature style. The title track, after three listens is such an electronic masterpiece. 'Music' deserves the number 1 single placement in Australia that it has received (great video too). I agree with others, the other tracks take a couple of listens to take to, but absolute gems they are ! There is only one MAJOR disappointment with this album. In Australia they have included her recent hit 'American Pie' which is quite possibly the worst cover of any song."
1,Tries to be clever and fails,"Madonna is such an overhyped artist. Like Kylie Minogue, her last album is roughly as good as her last producer. 'Ray of Light' is Madonna's only great album. Here she hires a badly-chosen producer (Mirwais) and tries to create a new inyourface electronica style for her pop songs. What? Daft Punk were using the musical ideas here many years before Madonna, only much better. The tracks here sound rather pretentious and boring with no groove or soul."
2,Music? Right,"The first thing is yeah, what's up with the cowboy get up? Does she think she is American country/cowgirl? Wrong direction Madonna! Ray of Light was great, Music is a disappointment. Relying way too much on the mixers to do the work. She also really rushed this album out (wonder why?). It maybe a commercial success but as we all know Britney Spears is also a commercial success. I have to admit that i like some of the dance mixes of the single Music (at the club that you can dance to) but the vocal is just annoying and pointless and very cliche ""music bring together people..."" whatever!"
2,Mediocre,"This album represents Madonna at one of her creative low points. Opening with the mundane and childish Music and closing with the mature and beautiful Gone. Much like Bedtime Stories this album is a mixed bag and has several sub par tracks jumbled in with the good. Contrived and pretencious lyrics abound on many of the tracks. Also the synthesizer vocal effect is used in embarrasing excess making the album sound terribly dated. The lyrics are not printed in the cd booklet for a very good reason. This reason being that the song writing lacks any imagination or creativity so there is no reason to want to read them. The all time low points in Madonna's career are the cornball Nobody's perfect, Runaway Lover, Paradise is not for me and Impressive Instant. Be sure to buy a programable CD player to spare your ears from such garabage. The rest of the songs are pleasant enough and worth listening to."
3,Scrawlings of a Madonna Visitor....,I wasn't as hooked by this as her previous album RAY OF LIGHT and the one after: AMERICAN LIFE....Music is a lot flatter and doesn't quite succeed in creating the vibe for me...My version has American Pie on it! Not sure why this one here doesn't...
2,"Hm.......sorry, Music cannot hold a candle to Ray of Light","I know that most people appear to love this album, and apparently, it has gotten great reviews. While I have to admit that she is somewhat of an innovator, and while these are new tunes, I have to agree with some of the critics that they are also kind of lame tunes that are not all too catchy. Sorry, but Ray of Light was a million times better...but hey, á chaqu'un son gout, as the french like to say....JM"
2,Really Disappointing,"I've always been a Madonna fan, and found ""Ray of Light"" absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, ""Music"" is nowhere near as good. The melodies are very average, the lyrics tired, and the subject matter shallow. It just feels like Madonna didn't put any effort into this one. ""Ray of Light"" felt like she was showing us a part of her soul -- ""Music"" feels like she's showing us nothing. Really disappointing."
5,her most musical album? possibly,"Madonna released this record at a time when teen pop was taking up the airwaves and getting rather annoying and this CD was truly a breath of fresh air worthy of being called ""music"" and madonna knew this too when she was working on the album and the results were beautiful. The title track is a dance/pop hit but the rest of the album is mostly guitar ballads combined with electronica sounds and slightly r&b, though in a more subtle way than Ray of Light. 5 years later and this album still sounds fresh like it hasn't aged at all. If madonna had done a musical in her career I'm sure it would have sounded like this awesome album."
5,Madonna first music of the twenty-first century,"Contrary to what she wore in the cover photo,Madonna has not gone country. This ten-track album spawned the Top 20 hits,the title track,WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL and DON'T TELL ME. The guitar on GONE sounds beautiful. The other tracks are great."
2,Get Erotica instead!!!!!,"Um, ok. When I first heard the song Music, I was really eager to get her new cd. I bought it and when I got it home and listened to it, I was soooooooo disappointed. I am not trying to trash Madonna at all because I love her, but this cd was not her best. Acutally, it was worse than Ray Of Light and I didn't really care for that one either. I think Madonna was her best when THe Immaculate Collection and Erotica came out. She looked fabulous then. She looks good still now, but man, she needs some better material. I did like Music, and Impressive Instant. The rest is really just not that good. Spend your money on a worthy Madonna cd like Erotica."
2,Ray of Light it is not!,"Well, This definitely is not Madonna best work. I really expected a notch above Ray of Light (one of the best albums of all time, by anyone). This album definitely was not that. I felt it to be repetitive trip-hop loops amongt souless songs. It feels like she just threw a dance-techno album together without much consideration for track listings or music thought. I expected Ray of Light and got the Gambler."
5,She deserves it - her greatest impressive instant,"This has to be Madonna's best album yet. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of Music (single) because there's so much more in music and lyrics. Madonna takes the world's trendiest music and makes it a part of her. My personal favourite: I deserve it. Her voice sounds so clear and passionate there... But there's also Impressive Instant, which must hit the dance floors all around the world pretty soon. I had already listened to all the tracks (thanks to Napster) and I couldn't wait to own it!! If you buy it (which you should) don't forget to look for the B-Side Cyberraga."
3,Not her best album,"The title track is the best work on this CD. I like Madonna and I like her music and this isn't her best showing. It seems harried and pieced together with little thought. I hate to knock her music, but you'll agree with me when you hear the other tracks.I don't want to seem overcritical, I know my place (upper-middle class) and I know hers (mega-superstar). This simply isn't the best work she's capable of."
4,Another solid album,"My first Madonna purchase was 1998's Ray of Light and I was not disappointed. Her follow-up effort to that critically acclaimed album is ""Music"". It's a very nice album that follows along in the tradition of Ray Of Light. It's a good album, but it's filled with many ballads and slow-sounding type songs. If you like that sort of thing then I suggest you listen to it. My favorite tracks on the album are the title track, Impressive Instant, Runaway Lover, Don't Tell Me, Paradise, What It Feels Like For A Girl, Amazing, I Deserve It, and my absolute fave on the album Nobody's Perfect."
4,good solid madonna album,"this is an amazing album in many ways. it starts with a techno-loaded bang, the chart topping ""Music."" the other prime cuts are ""Runaway Lover""--obvious message and foot tapping beat--""I deserve it""--soul-searching ballad--""Don't tell me""--easy to listen to and rootsy--and ""Gone""--taking a turn toward girl a cappella harmony country. More annoying are the voice distortions on ""Nobody's Perfect"" (and the irritatingly plain lyrics; ""I feel so sad, I feel so bad, sorry but-nobody's perfect,"" etc.) and the almost-but-not-quite-haunting ""Paradise."" Still, this is an album that you don't get sick of easily, a definite gem in Madonna's crown. She will continue to make great music with different twists as long as we let her."
3,"Not As Good As ""Ray Of Light""","Madonna's always been the one to pour her heart and soul into every album she's ever done, including this one. But as soon as I listened to the record all the way through, I can honestly say that I was a little disappointed. Sure, the opening song is astonishing, and so is ""Impressive Instant,"" but the album starts taking a dive from there, leaving the listener baffled. There are a couple highlights though on the album such as Amazing, and What It Feels Like For A Girl, but the album itself is loaded with sound, and that is pretty much overrated as it is. This is a good album, but not as good as the albums she has made in the past."
3,Madonna trying to be funky??,"Nope! This ain't it! I love Madonna! I have great respect for this artist. She's been around a long time. A vocalist she is not! Never has been! But she knows how to strut her stuff. That's what it's all about right? Entertainment. I don't quite understand that Bootsy cowboy funk outfit? Might have worked if the grooves were more funky and less computerized, technical studio gimmicks! You go Madonna! Much love for you for trying to get funky."
2,Where's the real Madonna?,"Since her very first debut so long ago, I have been a fan of Madonna, but I have to say that I am disappointed in this album , as I was with Ray of Light. I wish she would come off of this electronic scenario. It does not suit her."
2,Fair,"Music is a fair album. It is not very good. The reason why is of course the production , the vocals and the lyrics. Madonna barely sings on this album and when she does she does not really puts anything in it. The lyrics are dumb and not very deep or anything special. Her voice is annoying and the album is a bit overproduced she mixes acoustic guitar with electronic music and is a good idea however poorly done. The album has few songs that are allright such as What It feels for a girl, Music, Don't Tell Me and Gone but the rest is just awful. I just heard her new single and I believe it is going to be a popular one however I think she should really be careful because indeed she may fall rock hard ( even though it hardly matters) because she has already reached the top but she is making terrible music and she is along with a lot of other musicians ruining the music business."
2,Not sure about this one....,"There are some songs on here I love, and others I could live without. I love ""Music"" and ""Don't Tell Me"", but could do without a lot of the others. As a Madonna fan, this CD is a must have, expecially if you liked Ray of Light. But if you are just starting out, not sure if this is for you."
3,Music ? Too much Techno Mixing..,"Madonna's new Album is another notch down from her previous albums. I love Madonna's true voice, and not a techno replacement. I felt Ray of light was acceptable, but Music just went too far. No more albums like this Madonna, Please! I continue to listen to all her old albums, and wish she could go back and produce those type. If any of you seen her on the Live Internet Concert on MSN, you will quickly observe how much more enjoyable her old songs were when she privledged the audience with those songs."
2,Sorry to say Madonna is not at her finest on this one.,"I had recieved Madonna's music for Christmas because I am a big Madonna fan and after listening to it I'm sorry to say that I'm not impressed. First of all,I do like the album's title track and the Maxi-single of the mixes was very good, but the rest of this album I just didn't care for. I am used to Madonna's dance music and I Just have to say that Techno just isn't for her. And a lot of the lyrics on this album aren't as sexy and imaginative as I know madonna to be. To save you dear reader time there is just something about this album that isn't Madonna and I just can't think of the right words to describe it. Hopefully with her next album Madonna will drop the cowgirl charade and get back to her Dance Music roots."
5,Great CD for young adults to Grandma's and Grandpa's,"This CD includes a mixed bag of ""Music."" Includes futuristic dance songs, pop songs and sit back and relax ballads. The lyrics in which Madonna co-wrote on each song are unique and excellent. I certainly appreciate an artist that writes their own music and/or has some artistic say in that. Some of these songs have a positive message especially ""Gone"" in which she sings ""..nothing equals nothing."" Which is entirely ture. While some might find this song a downturn, to me it is a work of art. I appreciate each song on this CD and it grows on me the more I listen to it. As of now, this is the only CD I am currently listening to."
1,Welcome to the cliche,"As others, I bought the CD after hearing the ""Music"" single. I really like the song, but the rest of the CD lacks any intelligence. Such music makers as William Orbit should refrain from the Goddess of bland and focus on newer and off beat artist. If you're looking for a CD with spunk, and artistic gusto, check out Meg Lee Chin's ""Snake and Junkies."" I dare you to take a risk!"
1,Very Disappointing - Madonna's Musical Middle Age Crisis,"I loved Ray of Light, but this CD is terrible in comparison. Many of the lyrics sound like something a 4th grader would write and the electronic voice stuff gets old fast. I guess my first clue should have been the cowgirl outfit on the front cover. This just isn't the Madonna we all know and have come to love to see what she does next. This album seems like it is more of a novice artist's than Madonna's. It's like she is going through a musical middle age crisis and has lost herself somewhere along the way."
2,empty album,"In my opinion, this album certainly lacks depth. It sounds like the woman has not matured. The lyrics are surprisingly empty and cliched in most songs. Some parts are catchy (Music, Impressive Instant, Paradise -- how lovely to hear her speak French, my mother tongue), but not enough to make me listen to the songs over and over again like I usually do with Madonna's music. Even when I first heard ""Music"" on the radio I was suprised it was actually made by Madonna. Could have been made by Britney or some other teenagers. The album leaves me with a strange feeling."
4,A fun and mature album - I loved it.,"The first Madonna album I have ever purchased (I am 35 years old). I am primarily a purchaser of classic and accoustic rock. When I heard ""Don't Tell Me"" on the radio, I instantly loved it. Everything about the song is great - the beat, lyrics, crisp sound, and silence - the use of silence as a part of the song is fantastic and unlike anything I have ever heard in a pop music song.I liked all the songs but ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""I Deserve It"" were my favorites.Whatever one thinks of Madonna one thing is certain- she is one of the great artists in music whether its Pop, rock 'n roll, etc.. Period."
4,The Material Girl Strikes Again!,"Madonna has been an Icon for twenty years now. ""Music"", her release from 2000 has some great material on it. Of course, the title track is blazing and went straight to number 1. ""Don't Tell Me"" is also another great track, as is the often overlooked ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"". If you don't own it, buy it!"
4,A thought or two,"I do like this album - there's something about Mirwais' in-your-face-bass that really hits the spot. The difference in styles between the various co-producers on each track is particularly noticeable - overall, however, I would say that this is an album that is poignant while remaining strikingly simple.For those who criticise ""mindless drum machines"", I put forward what I remember of a quote by Bjork. She said that, if the music has ""no soul"", people tend to point the finger at the computer. However, Bjork suggests computers are just a tool, like guitars or pianos. If the music has no soul, that is because no one has put it there - it's not the fault of the computer.I believe that Madonna given this album a soul. You decide for yourself."
3,Good but not a classic,"When I first listened to this cd, I immediately hated the cd except for Music and Runaway Lover but I wasn't willing to give up on this cd yet. I continued to listen to it until I actually started liking tracks like Instant Impressive and Nobody's Perfect. I knew that this cd wasn't going to be ROL part two however this cd fell short of my expectations. The main problem I have with this cd is that this cd is bogged down my too many slow songs. The other problem is that Mirwais. He and Madonna are like apples and bananas, or oil and water. They didn't make a good combination."
4,...makes the people come together,"Certainly it does. Spanning close to 2 decades in her career,Madonna is MUSIC personified.With her new release aptly titled Music, Madonna is back to once again give us pure pop glory.At first listen,one could link songs from Madonna's past works(not that I'm complaining)Songs like ""amazing"" echoed heavilly on ""Beautiful Stranger""...""impressive instant"" is likened to ""thief of hearts"" from the Erotica album.But all in all this offering is as pop as pop music can get. The feel of the whole album is gaily,whimsical and fun."
3,okay,"Madonna, is back, but this cd is is only okay. You only have a couple songs that a real good, but beside that the others really are bad. like music, what it feels like for a girl, are great songs that you can't stop listening to, but that's about it! It's a good cd if you like dancing music, and a great beat! But beware of wasting your, money since there are only 10 songs a normal cd has about 15 songs. But get if you are a fan and like dancing! Chow!"
3,"Madonna's ""Music"" Dont Top ""Ray Of Light""","This was a anxious release, after the amazing album that is ""Ray Of Light"", ""Madonna"" Decided to release a new album 2 years later called ""Music"", the first single ""Music"" Was Cool, went to #1, yeah whatever. Then came her really cool song ""Dont tell me"" then ""American Pie"", and ""What It Feels Like For A Girl""..This is an album that has alot to offer, but is hardly her best, even though its really cool songs. This I give 3 Stars because Its not bad, but its not her best. But I reccomend you give ""Music"" A go. You wont be that dissapointed in her new Reinvention For The Millenium."
4,Could be a little better..but great already!,"I've been a Madonna fan for quite a while, of course her greatest work was the Immaculate Collection, but this wasn't as bad as some people were making it out to be. Here are some songs that I thought were great from this album:1. Music-Yes, this is why I bought this album in the first place. Didn't really like the song at first, but it grew on me!2. Runaway Lover-Gotta love the catchy beat on this one!3. Nobody's Perfect-I don't know why people are not a fan of the so-called 'vocoder', but I think it makes the song stand out from the rest with it and a lot of great songs were made by using this.4. Don't Tell Me-This is the song that I have played the most on here. I've heard this a ton of times and I'm always coming back for more.5. What It Feels Like For A Girl-Her newest song, great beat to this as well.Not a bad effort on her part at all here! I'm feeling this!"
1,You Call This Music?,"Sorry ... I really can't stand this CD. It's totally empty and meaningless. I enjoyed Ray Of Light a lot but this is really bad ""music""."
1,Poor follow up,"I'm a huge fan of Madonna, but I was bitterly disappointed with this album. The title track is the only decent tune on the entire album, and stands in the shadow of Ray of Light.I managed to get a refund for this crappy album, and got Sarah McLaclan's Fumbling towards Ectasy instead, much better, buy it!"
4,Her paradise is for me,"Often dubbed the ""disappointing"" follow up to 1998's bloated opus Ray Of Light, Music is the better album in my opinion. While she could have dug a little deeper for the lyrics and left that damned vocoder buried in Chers closet the album is still a solid effort. Kicking off with the international smash hit ""Music"" the album is consistently good only stumbling here and there on songs like ""Runaway Lover"", production being to generic, and ""Nobody's Perfect"", nice song done in by satanic vocoder. Perfection achieved in songs like ""Don't Tell Me"", ""I Deserve It"", ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"", and ""Paradise (not for me)"" more than make up for any missteps along the way."
1,"Something Missing Here, I think it's music!","It is truly a misnomer to have titled this album ""MUSIC"" when in fact it doesn't contain any, or if there is it is kept well hidden. Once again Madonna proves beyond a doubt that attitude and controversy are no substitute for the real thing(Talent). The backgrounds are so fabricated and overproduced that it's hard to tell sometimes what you're listening too. If you're a fan of her earlier stuff, I would recommmend sticking to it. Afterall when it was first released it was just junk, now however it has become vintage junk!"
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of hers since her first LP back in the early '80s when I was freshman in high school. But this collection left me wanting MUCH more. Music and What It Feels Like Being A Girl are the only two, in my opionion, that rate any merit and the only reason for the 2 stars - one for each song. The rest of the cd is just filler. I was hoping for a much more upbeat, dance-oriented cd after her mellow, introspective Ray of Light which I LOVED; probably her crowning achievement (although I still count Vouge, both song and video and her Like a Prayer CD among her best work. However, I still admire her balls for exeperimentation and I'm already looking forward to her next creation and a concert. She is truly one artist who will always be in the forefront. Hopefully, we won't have to wait for her to have another kid in order for her to be inspired."
1,Just Awful!,"Back in 2000, I was still a huge Madonna fan. I kept wondering how she could of followed up the great ""Ray Of Light"" album and also she had recently had a hit movie soundtrack single titled ""Beautiful Stranger"". All of this was great, until I heard she was having a new album out. When I heard the first single, I was really disappointed. The track ""Music"" is more of euro pop and in my opinion is just awful. Majority of the album is like this. The 2nd single ""Don't Tell Me"", is the only decent track on this album. The 3rd single ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"" is just awful, in the words of Madonna ""Degrating"". I tried listening to other tracks such as ""Amazing"" and ""Paradise"", and so on. But there was nothing else on the album to offer to me. The Ray Of Light album had everything to offer on it. Now in 2005, she still has not yet made a record better than ""Ray Of Light"", Hopefully she will get back to her roots. Better luck next time Madonna!"
4,I'm in a traaaaaaaaaance,"madonna celebrating the year 2000 with Music, she returned to a place she wasn't for a long time. a No.1 album and a No.1 single(music) This album is extremedly different from the others, first why she went this way?????? well what girls appeared last year (1999) of course Christina and Protegge Britney. She got to do something fresh and not stay out of line. this is a mixed of Dance/techno songs with guitar balladsoutstanding tracks here are:music , impressive instant(this one was supposed to be the 3d single instead of What it feels.... but warner wanted an new spanish song from her so was a little difficult to translate I.I. so they released What it feels...and Lo que siente la mujer) Runaway lover, Paradise, Don't tell me and my fav Gone."
4,Moving to the beat of her own drummer,"The most famous woman in the world once again has the world listening to her voice. On this album sometimes that voice is put through a computer (i.e. Cher) but it still sends the same message, MUSIC. Music is the one area in Madonna's life that she rarely makes a mistake. Possibly because she has so much control over the final product. Maybe she should start producing and directing her own movies. With high-energy dance tunes and slower ballads of love, there is something on this album for every Madonna fan. This is no Ray of Light 2, nor would anyone expect that from Madonna. When it comes to her music, Madonna is hardly one to look back. Can you imagine listening to Like a Virgin now? If you enjoy Madonna, rush out and get this excellent new album. If you don't enjoy Madonna, what are you doing reading this?"
4,Not as good as it could be,"Well, I have been a Madonna fan since she first hit the scene. Over the years she has put out many good tunes, but her albums (along with her voice) became more sophisticated as she matured. This album, although it has a few redeeming tunes, is a step backward for the material girl. The repetitive lyrics are empty and leave a lot to be desired. With her new found ""enlightenment"" I had hoped for a little more substance and not just a bunch of techno mumble jumble. Of course, I give this 4 stars because even the worst of Madonna is better than most."
2,Could of Done Better,"Her first few albums were quite good. I don't know what happened after that. Her songs lack the beat and enthusiasm she used to evoke. This album I would definitely pass up. It's not worth the buck. maybe when she comes out with something more interesting, I would consider buying her music, but until then, I think I'll pass on this one."
4,A different kind of review....,"I had time to review the whole album. I've taken the liberty to rename some of the tracks...Track 1: ""Music"" I give it an 8 It's rockin. I hate the video. I lived through that time period and I didn't like the style then and I don't like it now.Track 2: ""I'm in a Trance"" I give it a 9 It could be my favorite track.Track 3: ""It doesn't Pay"" 8 It's got a good beat and you can dance to itTrack 4: ""This Guy"" FEH 3Track 5: ""Beautiful Stranger part 2"" I actually don't think it sounds that much like ""Beautiful Stranger"" I give it a 6Track 6: ""Nobody's Perfect"" Has some Beatles rip off type stuff going on. But I still only give it a 4Track 7: ""Sweet Home Alabama"" 6Track 8: ""What it's like to be a girl"" Monotonous 5Track 9: ""Love to love you Baby"" 1Track 10: ""Madonna Unplugged"" 5I used to be able to tell you what was going to hit and what would not. But I no longer have my finger on the pulse. Good Luck Madonna your no Britney Spears. Thank God. What?!?"
1,Below average followup to Ray of Light,"This might have been Madonna's worst CD if she hadn't followed it with American Life (her rap cd!). Coming afer Ray of Light it's below average. Everything about this set of songs is gloomy, defeated, downbeat and low-rent. They seem to be written for someone with a three-note range. Most of the songs are slow, dirges. Madonna attempts to inveigle her way back onto dance floors with some regrettable (now hysterical) autotuning. She learned to play guitar for this cds appearances and thankfully Madonna's guitar playing career is now finished. The songs reflect the sort of lifeless strumming she could be entrusted to master in the short schedule between two cd releases. Worst of all is the song 'Music.' A feebler, more embarassing single has never been released."
1,Typical Madonna,She has some interesting Ideas but that Voice is even worse Now then it was before.Musically she is just following trends.nothing that she hasn't already done before.this type of an Album Leaves me feeling empty.Yes Madonna is one of The Greatest Ever at Re-Inventing Herself:Ironicly it isn't with Music though.another Over Hyped&Overrated Talking about Madonna.
3,Not the one in the picture!!,"Length:: 1:12 MinsSo the picture clearly shows a helmet from the 90s. It has a red stripe going down the middle, but the one they sent is the newer helmet, with a white stripe down the middle. I had to return the first one because I thought the helmets were defective. The sticker stripe going down the middle has an ugly air-bubble. I found out that all helmets come like this, it just the way they make them, which sucks because you expect it to be in great condition after all you are paying close to one hundred dollars! Returning my first helmet went very well. Amazon sent me one over 1 day delivery got it like two days later."
3,Picture?,i thought i was getting the one in the picture but didnt. and i think the m on the helmet means medium if so then i should have been warned if there where sizes i could have picked. other wise shipping was great.
5,Breathtaking,Beautiful album from start to finish. All you need is a few things to go along with it.A beautiful mateCandlelight dinner for twoChampangneIncensesthe rest will surely follow with this album....
3,All the songs sound the same,"I like this album, but after a while all the songs start to sound the same. I would just buy certain songs if I had to redo this purchase."
3,"Not the Greatest Bat-family Book, but OK","This is an adequate kickoff for the Nightwing series. The artwork by Scott McDaniel and company has it's own unique style, stylized but clean. Chuck Dixon's clunky script weighs the book down quite a bit, but the artwork helps to hold things together. ""A Knight in Bludhaven"" is mildly entertaining at best.""Birds of Prey"" is a far better ""Bat-family"" series. The books written by Gail Simone are fantastic.If you're looking for more Nightwing, check out ""The Outsiders"" (a fun, gritty series) by Judd Winick and ""Nightwing & Huntress"" (a great crime story) by Devin Grayson.Happy reading!"
3,Good,"Good, but no cigar. Nightwing is a good character and the story is sound but it feels like a Batman-centred-but-rejected story"
4,Nightwing rocks!,"Nightwing gets how own book and town (Bludhaven) and its fun. Dick Grayson is almost completely out of Batman's shadow and writer Chuck Dixon really lets him develop as a character. The setting, villains, supporting characters, etc., are all new to Nightwing and its great meeting these through his eyes. Scott McDaniel's art is good but a little frenetic at times. Overall a good fun book."
3,"""Reality Christmas""","""One Christmas"" was a film I happened upon some years ago. I did not know that it had been a story or a play, etc. I viewed it because I was familiar with the talents of the late Kathrine Hepburn and the talented Henry Winkler.The story is not typical Christmas fare, but it is more real than many of the idylic Christmas movies. It is a tribute to the truth that many people struggle 365 days a year--their imperfections not taking a holiday.Anyone who enjoys the talents of Winkler/Hepburn will enjoy this film; it is not stellar, not is not neccesarily their best performance, but it is a nice piece of ""reality Christmas"", if you will."
4,Teacher,"This is a well done version of the Truman Capote story by the same name. As always, the actual story is better, but Henry Winkler comes aross well as a gigolo trying to be dad for Christmas. You can view it with your kids, or use in in school to follow the reading of the story."
2,Way overrated!!,"We love Christmas movies but this was probably our biggest disappointment thus far. Expectations were high with the quality of the stars (Hepburn, Winkler) and the writer, but the quality scenes were just too few and far between. I suspect that people who liked the movie loved the book where the characters were presumably better developed and more likeable. Not having read the book, I found that I just didn't like the people on the screen and by the time they finally get into the spirit of Christmas, I just didn't care! Take a pass on this one."
4,Bitter sweet...,"I think this movie was heart wrenching just because I think the child wanted so badly to be with his mom and dad but unfortunately it just couldn't be that way. I can't give the end of the film away but I'll tell you it is very bitter sweet. A nice clean family movie, worth buying, worth watching."
2,So-so,I didn't particularly love this movie (though this is no fault of the great Henry Wrinkler). The relationship between the father and son is a struggle throughout and I found myself watching in disappointment and frustration as the young son tries to please his estranged father. Maybe this is the point; but I just didn't really enjoy the story line as much as I had hoped I would. I only watched this movie once and then put it in my donation bin.
1,"It's OK, Not Great",The DVD was OK. Not as I had expected. The father needed some talking to and help the young lad out and stop thinking about himself!
1,Leave this on the shelf!,"We were very disappointed in this movie. Terrible script, virtually no character development.Don't bother."
1,"Stick with ""Its a Wonderful Life""","I agree with the people who gave this one or two stars, no character development.There are much better xmas movies out there!"
4,nice story I sent it on to my grandchildren,great story and quality of CD was like new. I was proud to send it on to my grandchildren. Thanks
3,Okay Movie,It was okay...didn't hold my attention very much....Katherine Hepburn is the best part of this movie and her scenes are few and far between
4,Little disappointed,"Ok....I love Katharine Hepburn and Henry Winkler....however, I was disappointed in the role of Winkler and the way he treated the son.....however, ended good."
2,Disappointing,"I should have believed the other poor reviews. I thought that with the good work of Truman Capote, the director couldn't go wrong. Too bad he didn't follow the story and cast the characters accordingly. The kid in the movie is unlikeable, the father bears little resemblance to the character in the book, and I guess they put Hepburn in just to sell the movie. It was too late in her life and, as stated by others, it was very difficult to even look at her in the movie. Use the money you would have wasted on this lousy film and purchase the Truman Capote short story collection instead."
1,Worst Christmas Movie EVER!,"I watched this movie with my family and it was terrible. So terrible that we just had to laugh about it. The dad in the movie played by Henry Winkler is a jerk and you keep hoping that by the end of the movie, he will reflect on his behavior and try to make things right, but he doesn't. He just breaks his kid's heart, hurts his girlfriend, and by the end you just want to punch him in the face. I guess one good thing that I could say is that not everyone has a happy life in real life and this movie reflects some people are crappy and stay that way. OH AND BY THE WAY, the movie states that there is no Santa so don't watch it with your kids if you want them told through a crappy movie."
1,Please don't waste your time!,This movie was horrible! It is not worth watching. It was great to see Katherine Hepburn but I was sorry she as in this film.
3,Reproduction of original disappointing,"While looking forward to owning and reading this Sellers work on one of America's great artists and Revolutionary patriarchs I found I was immediately disappointed in the quality of the ACLS History E-Book hardback reproduction. The print and paper quality is acceptable if reading is all you want to do with the book. However the plate illustrations leave much to be desired, especially those illustrations which are nothing more than completely blacked out areas. Black and white illustrations were expected in this book but not in such poor reproduction quality. This is a real pity in a book featuring some of the most noteworthy paintings of the famed generations of Peale family painters. Be forewarned: buy this book to read; buy an art book to see the art. I just received my copy today and am returning it."
4,Softer and not sturdy as in picture,"Cute, soft, well-made, but does not stand as well as shown in the picture. But overall a nice toy. Good size too!"
3,Wish there was a detachable buckle on part that connects to seatbelt,"Overall, harness gets the job done. It prevents my cattle dog from bouncing around the car while I'm driving. But, she does wind herself around the seatbelt. I wish you could connect to just the shoulder part of the seatbelt, or to a LATCH hook, but other than that, it's a solid harness and does it's job."
1,Be afraid be very afraid,This unit should not be called reconditioned. I was sent a very used very diry machine lacking parts. I would not reccomend. Buyer beware
3,Campbell Hausfeld Pressure Washer,"Delivery was rapid and very satisfactory. The product was in good condition with the exception of one of the wheels, which was broker. I contacted the companies customer service and a new wheel was received in about five business days."
3,pressure washer review,"Not entirely as advertised. The washer did not come with the adjustable (fan to tight stream) wand that was specified in it's instructions, b ut instead had another type of wand that was much less versatile. A plastic quick disconnect system for the water input hose leaked so much that it could not be used and had to be replaced locally. The whole system was thrown together into its shipping box. --- On the other hand, the system is powerful enough for my needs and seems to work OK. Not a bad deal fot the price."
5,Campbell Hausfeld Pressure Washer 1500 PSI,"Very satisfied with the product. The box contained all attachments. No problems, no hassles. Easy to carry around. Looked and worked like new (except some scratches). Received the ordered item on a timely manner."
1,Still hasn't worked!,"the pressure cleaner which I received was in good condition with all parts accounted for. Unfortunately it hasn't worked since I received it. instead of shipping it back I called the manufacturer who directed me to a local shop to fix the unit, which is under warranty, and at no cost. I would stay away from this item."
1,horrible,"terrible acting, and it looks like it was filmed in 1975. it wasn't. it was filmed in 2011. bad 'cinematography', boring story, not a very attractive film aesthetically, and looked like a film student's first project -- a student who is going to fail at film."
2,Arguing always,"So much arguing. See enough of that everyday . Didn't even finish watching it. They named it right, Jingle Hell."
1,worse than awful,"For me, it started out badly within the first few minutes, and got increasingly worse. None of the characters were even remotely Irish, nor were they able to play the part convincingly. I say this being part Irish myself, and having lived through more than a few holiday dinner scenarios. I think there were more authentic Irish in the production staff.This didn't *feel* authentic, either. It didn't feel like a 2011 film, more like the 80's or so. Like early-on when, what appeared to be a doctor, a man at the dinner table, got a notification on his PAGER, and had to go to the kitchen, to call it in by land line PHONE. In an age when even kids have their own cell phones, who does that any more???Honestly, Although I watched it for free, through Amazon Prime, I couldn't watch it to the end, it was that bad. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would have, and that's time I won't ever get back. I certainly wouldn't pay money to rent it."
3,It was OK,"tHIS MOVIE WAS ok, iT WASN'T GREAT BUT IT WAS INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR ME TO FINISH WATCHING IT TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THE ENDING WAS ANTI-CLIMATIC."
3,20 Hot Potatoes Christians Are Afraid to Touch by Tony Campolo,"Tony Campolo's book, and therefore the issues he considers ""hot,"" are dated, but this is still an interesting book. Campolo is well known for his edgy speaking, ministry, and teaching. He is a Christian sociology professor turned moderate-to-liberal Christian activist, one who challenges conservatives to think carefully about their assumptions and sometimes too glib responses to intractable social problems. Some of his ""hot"" issues, like the challenge of AIDS, Christianity and homosexuals, and are evangelicals too pro-Israel, are still very much in the mix of contemporary concerns.You may not always agree with Campolo; I didn't. But you will find him thought-provoking. Some of his issues have faded, which is a lesson in itself, but his desire to apply his faith to his politics is admirable. The book's question and answer format is a good technique."
3,20 Hot Potatoes,"The book is excellent! The topics challange us in how we think of each topic based on our backgrounds. Tony puts a very fresh perspective on these controversial topics and challenges you to rethink what you think as you examine why you think the way you do.The condition of this particular copy was rather surprising given the rating in the listing. There seems to be an extreme amount of highlighting and underlining for a book listed as ""almost new"" condition."
4,More entertaining than provocative.,"Sometimes I think that Campolo just likes to push the buttons of complacent evangelicals whose version of social justice rarely goes beyond the issues of abortion and gay marriage but I think that's why I enjoy him so much. Some of these hot potatoes are not as controversial as they were when the book was written but I would read it just for Tony's personal stories, which are as delightful here as in his other writings."
1,DIfficult to deal with,"The company messed up my order, then would not respond to my request to return the item."
1,It's not really Amazon's fault.,"Amazon is just the site that displays this for the seller. It's like getting mad at e*a* because one of their sellers has too high a reserve. I am frustrated too since my wife and I both have these brushes and will never be able to afford heads for them again, but I choose to get angry at Phillips (Sonicare) and the jerks who are selling these heads at rates that would make ticket scalpers blush. If you want to see who's charging this ridiculous rate, click on sellers, then if you have time you could give them a call and tell them what you think of their business practices. You could even mention that you will NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN! Yaaaayyyyyy free market!!!!"
1,The Great Rip Off !,"It's not only Amazon folks, it's eBay, the web (just look at the ""Sonicare store,"") Target, etc.!! I've seen the range go from $60.00 to over 200.00! Another reviewer for this great toothbrush alluded to the fact that if the Phillips Co. didn't come up with a solution to this rip off they were through using their toothbrush systems. I agree, My family has used their product since the first one came out and we upgraded as they improved. Never were we ""forced"" into this type of gauging situation before. I hope everyone takes the time to get in touch with sonicare and express their outrage! I know I am!"
1,What a ripoff!,"You're asking $95 for two replacement heads??? Unbelievable! I'd much rather throw my Intelliclean ""system"" in the trash and buy a new electric toothbrush with reasonably-priced replacement parts than pay this ridiculous price! This brush was a flawed idea to begin with (that's why it's been discontinued)--the brush heads are impossible to keep clean. They get extremely moldy and nasty under the rubber and inside the assembly. These replacements are definitely not worth even the third of the price."
1,Outrageous scalping,I purchased these same brushes at the end of last year for about $25. Amazon is crazy to charge $179 and has definitely turned me away from their site as a reasonable alternative to shopping at a store. I think it would have been much better if Amazon had just dropped offering this product with a disclaimer about it being discontinued by the manufacturer as the reason why. Anyone in their right mind would go out and purchase a newer model for half the price which is what I will probably do. Amazon just lost my business.
5,Just what I expected,This is the type of item you know you want when you buy it. It fit my brush perfectly. My teeth are now clean. Therefore I am happy.
5,Good Product - Highly Recommend,"I couldn't find replacement brush heads for my Sonicare Intelliclean locally so I thought ""I bet Amazon has them,"" and yes, they did. I had purchased my Sonicare Intelliclean from my dentist. I have 3 attached bridges and this product's cleaning ability under them is fantastic. My teeth feel fresher and cleaner then they ever have. It was a wise purchase. The replacement head was easy to put on."
3,Ok,Ok but overpriced brush refills. Philips needs to lower their prices on these refills as the cost too much and you have to replace too often.
5,IntelliClean Makes Care for Teeth Easy,I've been using the Sonicare products for 3 years now and have settled on the IntelliClean system. My dentist and hygientist have noted that my teeth are very clean and healthy. I floss nearly daily and I am still achieving great results! I highly recommend this product!
2,Hard to find Replacement,"Sonicare IntelliClean Replacement Brush Heads - Set of 2I bought one of these electric toothbrushes for my husband several years ago. At the time it was one of the most expensive and ""top of the line"" systems to buy. However, now I can't seem to find the replacement heads for the brush at any of our local stores. In fact, this was the only place that I could find them. The system is a good one, but due to the price and inavailability of replacements parts, not one that I would recommend."
1,James,I have done some research on this product. Sonicare has discontinued it about 2 month ago. Amazon is price gouging you. The regular price is 29.99 for a set of two brush heads. Do not buy these at this price.
1,Time to buy a new toothbrush,"Time to buy a new toothbrush, the brush is not that good to pay that much just for two new heads."
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"$215 for two toothbrush heads? What a joke! While this model may have been discontinued, there is no reason to price gouge. Find some other sucker to buy your toothbrush heads."
3,Sonicare Intelliclean,"I bought the Sonicare Intelliclean when my last Sonicare died. It was the new and hotly promoted Sonicare at the time...now all but abandoned by the company. There is no value-added benefit from the toothpaste refill incorporated in the unit that I can see. The Sonicare is a really good product, but I can't recommend the Intelliclean model."
5,Sonicare Refill,The product was exactly the right one for my Intellilean system.The refills are better in my opinion then the original or at least they seem to be.If you don't have a Sonicare Toothbrush I highly recommend purchasing one from Amazon.Service is fast
1,Never recieved product,I don't know why my product has not arrived yet. All the shipping details are correct. Please enlighten i have purchased this product about a month ago. My name is Chris
5,Can't find them anywhere in town!!!,"For some reason the places that sell the toothbrush don't seem to carry the replacement heads. Ordered them on Amazon and received them quick (the next week)with no shipping and handling....gotta love that! This has been the best toothbrush, great for grabbing and brushing! Even the dentist commented on my daughter's teeth being so clean."
3,A Silly Concept,"While I think the Sonicare Toothbrushes in general are an excellent product and this version is certainly no exception, the addition of toothpaste is pretty silly. This feature makes the toothbrush replacement heads more expensive and harder to find. The same can be said of the toothpaste. It probably saves one a couple of seconds and I suppose would end the arguments regarding squeezing from the middle of the tube and leaving the cap off, but really how lazy have we gotten? I bought this toothbrush model because it was on sale and thereby cheaper than the others but I no longer use the toothpaste feature."
4,Dentist-clean feeling...,"I really like this toothbrush. No, I don't like having to replace the heads, and I really don't like having to use the special toothpaste. I can't find the toothpaste in stores around here anymore, so we stopped using it and use regular Colgate Total. I can't tell a difference.But I love the smooth and clean feeling, and I love the way this toothbrush seems to clean between the teeth better than a regular brush.Bottom line, the brush is a bit spendy, but, I think, worth it, and my teeth and gums are in much better shape than when I was using a plain brush."
1,Intelliclean is discontinued and I'm bummed!!,"Phillips does not manufacture the Intelliclean toothbrush anymore, therefore replacement parts (brush heads, paste, etc.) are hard to come by. I too, think $185 is ludicrous for a pack of replacement heads. For that amount, you could buy a newer brush system! I also am disappointed of Phillips Sonicare's decision of obsolescence and not informing customers who registered their product with them of this situation. (I bought mine approximately 2 years ago and paid a lot of money for it.) The only thing I can suggest is calling your dentist (if you bought yours through them-I did) and see if they can locate you some replacement heads at a reasonable price. That is what I have been doing and having success."
1,$185.00 is a rip off,"Quite a markup from $29.99. The system didn't cost that much and now it's 3 1/2 years old. I'll get a new toothbrush, thank you."
1,185.00...SERIOUSLY??????,"I have purchased refills for my intelliclean at least 2, if not 3 times from Amazon 25.00- 30.00 for a 2 pak. I thought it had to be a mistake when I saw 185.00..Apparently not.They really don't want anyone to buy their product. This is just disgusting!"
2,Sonicare IntelliClean Head Replacement-One Month Delivery?,"I'm not sure exactly when I ordered this but it was AT LEAST ONE MONTH and probably more! I like the toothbrush but I can order custom made products and have them delivered in less time! I'd rather spend a couple of extra dollars and get them from somebody else in less time. Having said that, it's hard to find them in local stores but there are other sources on the web."
4,The Godfather (PC),"Overall I thought the game was very good but there were two things I didn't like about it:There were way too many businesses and rackets. It takes forever for you to go around to each one and take it over. Ordinarily this doesn't seem like such an irritation in that it is a part of the game but there's only 5 or so different ""layouts"" so it seems like you do the same thing over and over again.I didn't really like the mob war situation. Every time you attempt to take over a warehouse or transport hub you inevitably start a mob war no matter what your heat level was. It seems like you wind up running to the FBI agent every 10 minutes."
4,Godfather (PC Game) Review,"It's a great game that follows the original movie line very closely - you become the behind-the-scenes soldier of the Corleone family and actually take part in several parts of the movie, but the movie just touched on, you actually do."
4,now on sale for ten bucks,"at that price its a Steal!I might have been upset if I paid $50.Yes the graphics are dated, but that means it should work with older video cards. The talking heads are spot on though. Backgrounds fuzzy.Linear gameplay mixed up with your choice of missions.Follows movie plot so a must if you love the movies to replay critical scenes with You on the scene. Movie scenes unlockables...I actually like the fighting system for a mouse but it plays with an XBOX 360 controller on the PC if you would prefer.Driving is tough but possible on the keyboard.Hey its just mindless fun and a bargain at the moment. Enjoy!"
2,"Great idea, horribly engineered","As some reviews have already stated, the controls in this game are HORRIBLE. It does not appear that the group who made this game did ANY testing at all. The camera is unmovable and its stuck in one of the worst positions i've ever seen as far as a camera is concerned. They tried to give the game a sort of Splinter Cell feel with a few of the camera and game mechanics but failed horribly.On the good side, the game's content isn't too bad. You can do things as advertised such as extortions. You also run on a point/reward/skill system which is very fun. The weapon mechanics seems nicely done.Back to the bad. The game is simply unplayable because of the controls. They also have cutscenes that can't be skipped. It's very sad that no one seems to raise an eyebrow in the company when/if they tested this joke of a game."
5,I love it.,"'The Godfather,'I like it.It is a good game.Good game play,good graphic,good control.In a sentance I can say that,It is the best."
4,Great Game!,"This game is great. I just have one main complaint. The driving in the game is very unrealistic, and jumps between either not reacting to a turn, or turning instantly on a 90 degree angle.Other than that, i love it!"
5,This book is amazing!,"I learned so much. She gives so many practical tips and excercizes and she tells you exactly what to do from day one to day thirty. Oh and you are just going to love the treasure mapping technique! It really works! Plus when I emailed her for advice she actually responded within a couple of hours. It is wonderful to know that when an author says she will be there for you, she really is."
5,Very inspiring,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. The author kept my interest and provided good examples for writing a children's book. She made me feel this is something I could do successfully. She used humor and imagination in stirring my creative juices. She explained what it takes not only to write but also to publish, promote and market your book. I'm going to get my pot of coffee started!"
4,Great for those who started but just can't finish ....,"This little volume packs as much of a punch as any of the ginormous or gigandous plodding tomes you will find on the same subject. This is the one that actually got me inspired to do what I wanted to do, sit down and write without that gnawing anxiety blocking my creative urge. If you think you've got a children's book in you and you just haven't been able to get it to come out--or you haven't been able to finish it--this book will do the trick. Once I find a publisher, look for my children's book on Amazon next. The working title: ""The Most Important Nation on Earth!"""
1,Not worth the money,I was expecting a book that would address the issues of children's book writing that many beginning authors face including working through plot glitches and character development on the small scale( particularly picture books). This book gave the bare bones basics about book writing. I felt very cheated. There was more information about putting together a poster board with you future wishes than writing technique. It just goes to show that anyone can write a book in thrity days-- it just doesn't have to be well written or informative.
1,How did this waste of space get into Amazon?,I received this as a gift from a friend who is encouraging me to write a kiddies book I have had up my sleeve for ages but never have the time to put pen on paper.... What I should have done is taken 2 hours to write a 'How to write a children's book in 30 day's or less' book and wait for any desperate soul to buy it and laugh my way to the bank. I am truely sorry my friend wasted good money (hard earned cash) on this. The best I can do to compensate is to write this review and let others know that this is a self published waste of time and your money. Everything that was valuable was in the title and that you got for free... so STOP procrastinating and start writing and dont buy this book.
1,Awful!,"This book is just a terrible, useless, complete waste of money. There are so many great writing books out there. I've read many. This is by far the worst of the bunch. Don't buy it."
1,waste of time,I am not sure listening to a person who has only 2 books is a great investment of time. Only 2 books ahead of you!
1,THE WORST!,"I have my own supplier for my fondant. But there was one time when I accepted a rush job and wasn't able to check that I don't have enough fondant left. So I went out to buy Wilton. I was so impressed on how easy it is to work with. So I cut my decors and colored it. As I was drying the stars, I tasted one (isn't that what good cooks are suppose to do?). I almost vomited when I tasted it. I am very sensitive to food taste and smell. The Wilton Fondant taste like rancid oil. At first I tasted the coloring and the pearl dust I used coz I thought the bad taste was coming from there (and the fact that I never thought Wilton can make such bad product). Anyway, I ended up calling my supplier and agreed to pick up the fondant just so I can get one."
3,Love this stuff hate the price,"I abosolutley love fondant i prefer Duff Brand but this is cheaper, here is the thing about the 1 pound 8 once. For one pound and * onces it is $10.00 but for more then double the fondant at $20.00 is the 5 pound box. Honestly, i would just get the 5 pound one at jo anns with a coupan and you get it for the price of this! RIP OFF!"
1,Tastes like...um......a REALLY BAD WORD!!!,"You would think that a company like Wilton would be number one in the fondant business, but, if they don't change the taste, people are going to continue to lose faith in ALL their products. I still find it hard to believe that they aren't aware that this fondant is laughably bad....of course, once you see the price....you stop laughing. I made the mistake of buying it ONCE...I won't make that mistake again. I should've known when the clerk at the cash made a face. I tried getting my money back to no avail. No one at the company cares. All I can say is ""BEWARE""....great for practice (if you enjoy throwing money away), but this is not fit for human consumption!!"
2,Use it in a pinch,"I used this fondant once because I bought it to give it a try. In a pinch it will do, and given that its cheaper than other brands (not by much though), one can arguably use it for decorations that are not mean to be eaten. The taste is horrible, I would compare it to gum paste in flavor. It is stickier than other brands and when you break pieces off of it this becomes an issue since you have more shaping to do. I use Satin Ice and think that it's much better."
1,"Easy to work with, but taste leaves much to be desired","The fondant is easy to roll and manipulate, but like other reviews, the taste leaves lots to be desired. The first time I tasted this fondant, it put me off working with fondant for sometime before I started making my own marshmallow fondant. Recommended only if you're going to pick the fondant off your cake before consuming, otherwise, make your own fondant. Its easier done than said~!"
2,Nostalgia is really boring...,"This is how war movies were made. Simple plot, low budget, repeated scenes from war documentaries and ending that is predicable. It was good to see Sterling Hayden in his prime. Good movie for a collector of old movies."
4,Great storage trunks- couple of improvements would be nice,"These storage trunks are very cute and pretty sturdy. You cannot sit on them but they seem well made. The only problem I had was that during shipping the side handles were bent a weird way, twisted around. The handles now stick out at crazy angles. They could have been made with an inflexible insert so that they keep their shape. I have pressed the trunks up against a wall, hoping to flatten them out. The only other suggestion I have is that the trunks could be lined so they do not snag blankets or delicate materials."
3,Bigger than expect and a little smelly!,Nice for extra storage!! But the boxes do have a very strong seagrass smell which thankfully fades in time.The larger boxes were larger than I expected for some reason.
5,Very Pleased!,"These Woven-Seagrass storages chests exceeded my expectations!!! They are exactly what I wanted and needed for storage, plus they are very attractive, and even have a very pleasant smell. They are surprizingly roomy and sturdy, even bigger and nicer than I had imagined from the pictures. Perfect for my beach condo decor. I like them sooo well, I am contemplating buying more as a possible gift."
4,"Item is good, but New was more like Used","My complaint is not with the item itself so that's why it got 4 stars. The new item was not new! I saw the bottom of the plastic had a slice. So I opened it fully to check it out. My suspicion was correct, it was used. The measure was scotch taped to the flask. I opened and looked in, there was powder residue, the finish was stained and very slightly pitted so I guess it's been sitting for a little bit. I cleaned it with solvent, it helped but not perfect - at least it's inside. Next time I guess I will take a trip to the store even if it is a little out of the way. At least I know new is new."
3,Not Quite Classic,"I am a big fan of Michael Pare, as well of biker movies. This movie combines almost all of the qualities that make a good sci-fi adventure movie a classic. I has a likeable hero, two love-to-hate villians, and an enjoyable, developed plot all the way through. Unfortunatley, where this film lacks is in teh musical score. The same annoying song is used over and over again, and oftentimes the music doesn't really seem to fit the action. This film might actually be made better with no music at all, such is the extent to which the music ruins the movie, depriving it of a deserved five-star rating."
3,Great flick!,"This is a surprisingly well-written and acted movie. I'd thought it'd be just another ho-hum sc-fi, but I was wrong. This film actually has some substance. The story has a number of complex plot twists, some predictable, some not. The star as well as the supporting actor playing the evil robot cop turn in really good performances, and the rest of the cast does a credible job as well. I do recommend it; I think you'll like it."
2,"Drago's talent under used in ""Solar""","For Billy Drago (Diplomatic Immunity) fans this is not an example of his best work but if you collect his movies, add it. The storyline is okay and Michael Pare (appearing with Mr. Drago again in Deadly Heros) is good in his role as a motorcycle-riding lunar cop from the future. For Drago fans though, Mr. Drago is the bad guy as usual but he uses a lot of profanity which is really not his style. As a psycho biker, Drago's role could have been developed more to give Pare a much better advisary. A good portrayal in the movie is done by Robin Smith (Never Say Die). He's an android from hell sent to finish up what Pare doesn't. Still, this movie is worth a look for any sci-fi lover."
2,please fix up this videos picture ASAP!,You have the wrong picture for this movie please fix up for B-grade sci-fi movie with Micheal Pare(Bad Moon.Falling Time)!
2,Pins did not match so useless,"My drive from a 4 year old, dead Aser Aspire laptop (WD400) had a smaller pin distribution than the adapter therefor could not be used. The instructions are negligible with no diagrams, markers on the adapter to begin to use this. My drive had no data to tell me what pin configuration it had so I have no idea what kind of adapter would work if any. Much more information is needed both in the offer at Amazon and in the item. Too bad as I had high hope for salvaging some data."
3,careful connections,The instructions for this device are poor. The connectors must all be done exactly correctly but there are not keys or images to help. I zapped the motor for the lap top drive I was attempting to read. The red and black power connection was inserted reverse and the unit received 5v on ground rather than 5v to correct power. I had another lap top drive and was able to load it up correctly. Since I had no use for that drive I reversed the power connections and burnt its motor. Later it acted dead when the power was oonnected correctly. There are some helpful connection layouts on this site http://base.liveperson.net/hc/s-21882319/cmd/kb/kbvisitorcontrol.jsp?cmd=entry&entryid=173509&ticket=LTK152020723080X My main message is to be very careful connecting the drive to the unit
4,Very useful product,"I wanted this product mainly to pull data off of laptop HDDs prior to refurbish or donation. It does everything it claims to do and with the exception of a few minor glitches (i.e., sometimes it doesn't see the drive right away), it worked seamlessly. I would strongly suggest that you plug everything up in the order stated in the instructions. This is an essential tool in every techie's toolbag."
1,Over-exaggerated Title,"Save your money -- buy a Thesaurus!! This book is 103 pages of basic and unsophicated information, not at all like the title may imply. If you are relying on this book to ""Empower"" your advertising, I'm afraid you will be gravely disappointed."
2,Where's Steve?,"This should be called the Peter Frampton Show. It's obvious the interviewer is a star chaser. Or maybe he didn't think anyone would watch without ""a name."" Don't get me wrong, I really like PF....but I was looking forward to much more about Steve. There are no interviews with the main man, for god's sake!! And I skip through that Herd video as fast as I can. It's a collosal waste of space and I don't get the purpose? Also, who wants to see the interviewer and his mullet? He should have just been a voice-over. A huge disappointment! BTW...you can see all the footage of Steve on You Tube....nothing new here.Note: I am not ""Happy with purchase, but..."". My title is simply, ""Where's Steve?"""
4,A Bluesman,"I play the blues.And occasionally,am asked who my biggest influence was.I usually see a look of confusion on their faces,when I proudly proclaim ""STEVE MARRIOTT!"", He was first and foremost a bluesman.,Listen to the track ""I WONDER"" on the"" SMOKIN'"" record.You'll understand.I've never heard a better blues harmonica. The film brought a tear to my eye ,and I thought it was GREAT!!"
4,"Good, balanced interesting read.","Having seen several films on her life, I wanted to know more.The book explains the Englishes motivation to prosecute her, the wisdom of her responses, her belief in her life purpose/mission and expectation of an afterlife."
1,A proselytizing tract,Don't bother with this book. There are plenty of other books about Joan of Arc out there. This one is essentially an extended religious tract. Why Harper/Collins put this out instead of a religious press is beyond me.
2,Poor staging,"I appreciate good voices like everyone, however a large part of my enjoyment is customes and sets. I recently purchased La Traviata on bluray and fortunately it was done at La Scala. However there was a bonus of excerpts done at Zurich. I did not even watch any aria to the end. All were in modern type dress. ( Edgar ) with straw hats. If they cannot afford the cost of these productions they should not attempt it. I will never buy onother production by either the Zurich or Flemish Opera Houses"
4,Funny Hats Aside...,"...this is a ""high concept"" staging that actually works. Director Cesare Lievi and his design team have successfully realized Rossini's nonsensical world in a fanciful way that never once gets in the way of the music. The main attraction here is, of course, Cecilia Bartoli, and she is in prime form, singing with her customary brilliance and precision. One wishes that some of the voices were stronger (Judith Schmid's Zaida is particularly weak) and that Ruggero Raimondi were a little less mature and a little more dashing. But all in all, this is a marvelous few hours of fun, great singing and inventive direction."
4,"Good book, unfortunately the market moves too fast","Wiersema's book is based on a research theory that if you identify leading companies you should be able to extract lessons that should be applicable to other companies. This approach is behind works such as ""Pursuit of Excellence"" and ""Built to Last"". Unfortunately for Wiersema he conducted his research at the peak of the economic boom of the 1990's. This makes many of Wiesema's conclusions ring hollow in the face of weak customer demand, increasing competition and an uncertain future.Wiersema's earlier book on Value Disciplines contributed early on to a move to core competency. This book represents an interesting academic exercise as to what was market leading in the 90's and less so on how to address current market realities and challenges."
5,I love this book,"I've owned this book for several years now. Reading, and re-reading these wonderful stories about these wonderful places. Each time I finish a chapter and close the book, I find myself filled with wanderlust, and a desire to gas up the airplane or ATV and follow those tantalizing clues Marilyn leaves behind.And... I do. There has been many an adventure filled day, out in the desert and canyons exploring the sites described in this book. Well worth reading, and a definite must have for any fan of the old West and Nevada history."
3,the rock,this is a true story starring the rock.he comes back from the army to a small town.its overun by a casino owner.the rock goes in and messes up the place for cheating his friend and the beat him severely and try to gut him.he barely lives.then he is tried with the assault.the jury sets him loose and he runs for and wins local sherriff.its rock vs basicly everbody else.its better than the mummy returns.its about as good as the scorpion king and not as good as rundown.
4,The Rock Walks Tall,"It's always difficult to come up with something new and exciting when you release a film about a macho guy that ""takes out the trash,"" especially when your story is a remake. It is even more difficult when the storyline is so formulaic that you see every scene coming from a mile away. So, what makes the 2004 version of WALKING TALL any different? Simply put, charm! The Rock continues to prove that he is worthy of movie stardom by not taking himself so seriously and putting a degree of fun into the role. Where Van Damme and Seagal have fizzled out, The Rock, my friends, is here to stay. Also, showing that there is more to talent than being bruised, beaten up, and electrocuted, Johnny Knoxville makes a credible and well-casted addition to the cast as The Rock's right hand man. Although there isn't anything new to offer, sometimes it's fun to take the same ride with all new friends!"
3,ORIGINAL IS WAY BETTER,"The Rock turns in another top notch performance but this version of Walking Tall seems to be just a summary of the original. Running about an hour shorter than the original, you don't get the feel for the characters and just when things get rolling, the movie is over. I am not saying that this was not a good movie, I am just saying it could have been better, and when you get the chance, check out the original and see for yourself."
4,The Rock does it again,"The Rock(The Rundown, The Mummy Returns) is Chris Vaughn who returns to his hometown for over a span of 3 years and finds it changed. The mill is close but theres a fancy Casino put up by his friend played by Neal McDonough(Minority Report, Ravenous). So The Rock takes matters into his own hands as he finds out kids are being sold drugs from the Casinos security guards. He also is put on trial but wins and is made Sheriff and makes his friend played by Johnny Knoxville(Men In Black 2, Jackass The Movie) deputy. The Rock bust out moves with a 2by4 and makes vengeance. I think Buford Pusser would be proud of him. Walking Tall is my pic of the weekend. Check it out I really recommend it. My favorite part it where Knoxville is annoying the guy in the cage with a megaphone, hilarious."
5,great,i went to see this movie and was very pleased with it. i thought the rock did an excellent job. i do not watch wrestling so i do not have my judgement clouded by whatever his character was like on tv. but in this movie i thought he gave a believeable preformance. i loved the rundown so i had to check this one out too.
4,The Rock rocks...as always,"No Oscars here, but beautiful Pacific Northwest scenery and great action scenes. This is a fun watch and a diversion from the daily grind."
3,Not a bad movie,"I'd give this movie 3.5 stars if I could. It's not quite a 4 star. It's a good B-movie to watch when you have nothing better to do. The Rock is great, and its fun watching him kick butt! Some of the film scenes are irrelevant--but it likely kept the attention of the guys. Johnny Knoxville played a great comedic side kick, his timing is perfect. My favorite part is always when they destroy the pick-up truck. Knoxville is hilarious! Overall, the movie is what it is--not great, but has its fun moments."
2,The original was better and true.,This is a remake of a 1970's movie that was based on a true story. This one is high on special effects but short on plot and not even slightly based on the true story of a local American hero that stood up against impossible odds because it was the right thing to do.
1,Not Rated Correctly,"I normally have liked Dwayne Johnson movies, but this movie was a bad selection. Not only was the acting terrible, it was not appropriate for 13-year-olds, or any adolescent. I'm tired of not being able to watch a decent movie with my kids because of all the sexual innuendos, and scantily clad women. Come On, Hollywood!! Have some originality and make some good family movies."
3,An OK flick,"1) Predictable story. For instance, the character of Chris Vaughn (the Rock) was entering the town's new casino. I told my wife, ""Watch, we haven't seen the old hometown girlfriend yet, I'll bet you she is here in the employee of the bad guys in some form or another."" Sure enough. The rest of the movie was similarly predictable2) The good and bad of it all is that this was just an excuse for action. The good = it wasn't bad action and stuff got blown up. Cool! The bad = we really don't care about many of the characters and some are completely forgotten after they are introduced in the first part of the movie.Overall, I liked The Rundown a lot more than this, but this was much better than Scorpion King. I hope The Rock gets some good sci-fi action to portfolio like Vin Diesle has the Riddick stuff. He is fun to watch regardless and if you want a late night no-brainer then this will work."
2,I LIKED THE ORIGINAL MOVIE MUCH BETTER,"THIS REMAKE OF THE 1973 CULT CLASSIC IS WELL, QUESTIONABLE. CHRIS VAUGHN [THE ROCK] RETURNS TO WASHINGTON AFTER SERVING IN THE MILITARY TO ONLY FIND OUT THAT HIS HOMETOWN IS FILLED WITH CORRUPTION AND CRIME. THIS VERSION IS LESS VIOLENT THAN THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S ALSO LESS ENTERTAINING. THE ROCK DOES THE BEST HE CAN, BUT AFTER A WHILE, THIS MOVIE TENDS TO CEASE BEING INTERESTING. ALL IN ALL, IT'S A WATCHABLE MOVIE, BUT I BET YOU WON'T WANNA WATCH IT MORE THAN ONCE! LIKE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, BASED ON A TRUE STORY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S NAME HAS CHANGED."
2,If you want to see the Rock get The Rundown.,"There are only two reasons I can think for anyone to check out this movie: awesome action, and Johnny Knoxville.This movie plays out like an after school morality movie on drugs. The acting and the script are subpar. Of course that's typically the way movies based on morality are. But then one has to question a movie that glorifies a character who uses illegal means to punish immoral people.Of course, just like any movie based on a moral principle the movie is kind of dry and predictable. Good action though, but not enough reason to go out and rent or buy the movie in my opinion. Unfortunate too because I like the Rock and would like to see him succeed on the big screen."
3,OK,I like the Rock and I have agianst him beating people up with a 4x4. There are some deacent action parts and the sidekick in this movie happens to be a good sidekick unlike the annoying one in that other movie that Rock did...King something or other.The movie as far to short not even an hour and 1/2. The bad guys never really get any development at all. Everone does the best with what they have but the script doesn't give them alot to work with.Also the DVD features just suck the alternate ending is just stupid and there is a totally valid reason why all of those sceans were cut...they didn't add anything to the story. The only fun part the blopper reel only went on for about 2 minutes.Overall-Watch it if you are a Rock fan but don't pay for the rental yourself.
3,Too Short,This film was just way to short. There was no middle part. It was like the begining jumped to the end in one second. If they would have elaborated some scenes a little more it might have been a better movie. I just think it looks like those movies made for tv. Dwayne Johnson (rock) did alright in his acting role. Who doesnt like seeing him kick everyones butt? Overall the film is still entertaining but there are better movies out there.
1,CHHHHHEEEEEEZZZZZYYYYYY!,"You know you're looking at a poor screenplay when you start hearing things like ""Are you okay?"" The Rock was stabbed several times and left for dead in the middle of the road, how do you think he is? Johnny Knoxville and the other supporting characters serve as the main acting talent in this movie, whereas the Rock's character seems to be devoid of any personality traits other than his nostalgia for his hometown. Other cheesy scenes include violence, violence in a casino, violence with wet t-shirt pole dancing chicks, and finally, a troubled youngster who starts out angry at the protagonist, then learns to respect him. What a redundant plot! Im glad I got this rental for free, but I wish I could have refunded my time scowling at this lame remake."
2,A really small pleasure,Walking tall is full of action cliche and low on plot. The Rock shows off his moves like he's done in every other movie. It's a boring fight fest.
4,Love This Movie!,I really enjoyed the non-stop action and adventure in this movie. A good Saturday night movie to watch at home and chill out. I think The Rock is so nice-looking. Nice modern version of the earlier picture.
2,What kind of name is the Rock?,"Words probably can't express how bad this movie is, but let's see... You can see every plot turn coming from a mile away, all the bad guys are preposterously bad, the cliches are running amok (the mill closed, things aren't how they used to be, cops are corrupt, the casino runs the town, kids are doing drugs, somebody needs to Clean Up This Town) The courtroom scene is one of the most laughably unrealistic in recent memory. Script is bad, acting is bad. When Johnny Knoxville is, by far, the best thing about your movie, you're in trouble. The one mark in the plus column: mercifully, the film clocks in at under 75 minutes!"
3,A watchable movie with full entertainment!,This yarn is a funny movie that works out as a deserved homage to Buford Pusser. Bad guys versus good guys who pretend clean off the people from this corrupt gang.The Rock with his well known charisma makes the best he can and he achieves it in this entertained film.
4,Awesome!,"I thought this movie was good, and the fact that it is inspired by a true story makes it that much better! The Rock is the perfect person to play this character. I think this movie had a nice balance of action and comedy, especially with a co-star like Johnny Knoxville. I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it, especially to people who are fans of The Rock!"
1,REALLY BAD REMAKE !,What ever good qualities were in the original did not make it into this remake! Really bad!
3,the rock hits wood,"The Rock is learning to act. Slyvester and Arnie have'nt learnt yet and never will. The Rock is in the House! I was impressed with him in Welcome To The Jungle, and although the action is not as thick and fast here, The Rock adds more drama to his character. He's tough still but he cares for his hometown and the kids. There's a bit of Firstblood in the storyline and I really don't know why Johnny Knoxville starred because his comedy just never works. I like the fact that Rock does all his damage with a selfmade baseball bat.....nice touch."
4,Great action movie,"This was a great movie, even with some of the usual hollywood BS fight scenes. Purists, beware, it only loosely resembles the actual story and the other movies. I actually like the Rock and I have liked all of his movies except Scorpion King....that was a stinker. He'll do just fine in action movies and I hope to see more. The movie has its funny moments complete with sidekick and it also has a very good villian. If you want drama, go somewhere else and get Driving Miss Daisy...gag. If you want action, humor, and fun buy this movie, don't rent it, you'll thank me for it. The only reason it gets a 4 star rating is the fact that it has a fight scene where they beat the crap out of each other and keep going....doesn't cut it with me. What really makes it stand out is the fact that the rest of the fight scenes are pretty realistic. A great movie, all in all."
3,The Rock manages to stay walking tall in this blustery chaos,"WALKING TALL is a film wildly dependent on destruction derby mentality. The premise of showing how a man (based on Buford Pusser's life) returns from Vietnam after an 8 year absence from his lumber mill focused town in Washington state to find that the mill is 'closed', the kids (including his nephew) are strung out on drugs, and the town's new focus is on a gambling etc casino run by his childhood friends gone very bad. Revenge and Cleanup are the themes here, a lot of good guy/bad guy encounters, and more destruction of property and sets than you can imagine. It makes its point (thus 3 stars), chiefly because of the presence of The Rock (oh, that he would change his name!) and his rehabbed sidekick Johnny Knoxville who actually make the film watchable. A good film if you're working out personal frustrations and need to identify with a superhero. Just don't expect too much else."
3,I only bought it for one reason...,"Well, I thought it was good, to a point. My favorite man, Kevin Durand was in it, and up until he died the movie rocked. But then I realized exactly how lame the movie really was. Lots of the Rock fighting and grunting. I'm not a big Rock fan, but Johnny Knoxville was pretty funny. He almost saved the movie for me. Almost."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad movie. Entertaining as action movies go. Good story. Watching Neal McDonough is never a bad thing either. He is a severly underrated actor, and I hope he gets the attention he deserves soon."
4,"Not a bad movie, Decent action, Jonny Knoxville and the rock made a decent team","Based on a true story that actually took place the south (? South carolina), Walking tall is a story of Chris (the Rock), a soldier fresh out of the marines, returning to his hometown finding it changed. The lumbermill is closed and A casino is the sole big employer in town. With the casino, crime and drugs have come as well. His friends take him to the casino to celebrate his return, and he catches a ""dirty dealer"", and calls him on it. Well, Casino security becomes involved...and thing go a bit to far, and he is cut up and left for dead. From then on, it becomes his goal to set things right. The cops aren't helping him, the casino owner, an old aquantence from high school, tries to keep things under the table. Well, why not fix thing by becoming sherrif...and he does. Good action, decent story, some humor at times. A decent 90 minutes, check it out."
1,The first reviewer had it right,"My whole reason for purchasing this was for the ""Plasticville"" skit. IMO one of the best SNL skits ever. You guessed it, edited out! The weekend update takes up half the edited episode and is boooring. I also experienced some of the delay and video drag mentioned by another reviewer - and this was after I downloaded it to the Kindle Fire. At least all I wasted was $1.99."
1,Another laugh-free year of SNL,"It is time for this terrible, unfunny show to be kicked off the air. About once a year I check it out and am disappointed -again. Even the first season is over-rated. Nothing more than a bunch of talentless hacks who hit it big. It is anti-funny. Don't watch if you just saw an excellent Family Guy or Simpsons show. You'll quickly lose the good mood you just hit."
2,Not as advertised,"Josh Brolin SNL episode was not complete. The sketches I bought them for were not included. Please do not advertise ""Buy Entire Episode"" if it is not the entire episode."
2,Musical Guest's Performance not included,I would not have spent the money or the time and effort it took to get this video had I known the Musical Guest's perfomance would not be included. Thanks alot.
2,Too much editing,"The description says ""(Edited Episodes)"", so I thought that maybe it would be limited to the musical guest, but that wasn't the case at all. Not only was the music gone, but there was at least one sketch and one digital short that were missing from the way it aired. This was a really great episode and I was ver disappointed to have 2 of the highlights cut out."
3,BAD scripts~ Michael Shines any way~ 3 STARS~~~~~,"This could have been so much better.BAD skit include a GAME show with no humor. HIGHLIGHT IS Olympic high light show ~ BEST is the Michael Phelps DIET~ beyond funny.Shows people who want the 12,000 calories Michael EATS so their diets do NOT suck~ WORTH THE WATCH FOR THIS SKIT ALONE.Too bad Michael who is better than expected was let down by the writers in this one. I hope they have you BACK with a much better script."
3,lightweight,"As much as I like Hugh Laurie as a comedian actor, he is a lightweight as a singer and guitar player but he brought good people into this CD."
2,"I really thought I would love this book, but...","Okay first off I have to say that I did LOVE the first Princess Smarty Pants. I even liked the story told in this one. My problem is this. I am a mother of an almost two year old who is multi racial. When I read this book it stuck me that the baby that PSP makes is brown. I had to ask myself why? The baby causes tons of trouble until PSP gets two dragons to help her take care of it. I bought it for my daughter's 2nd birthday, though she won't be getting it so soon. I have decided to save it for a few years until she is old enough to talk about and critically think about the imagery of a white woman needing dragons to held her take care of a little brown baby."
5,Wow! I can't believe some of these reviews!,"This is a beautiful book! I'm surprised that people are put off by the doll that grows from a seed; I see nothing creepy whatsoever about the doll. The only thing that concerns me... but certainly not enough to keep this book from my children... is the fact that she opens the gate, talks to and accepts a gift from a stranger. I always talk to my girls about how this is just a charming story, but we never talk to or accept gifts from strangers. If you're concerned, check it out from the library first, then buy it. My girls LOVE it."
1,We threw this book away.,We did not like this book and found it entirely creepy that the doll grew out of the ground. We disliked it so much that we did not even want to give it away and quite possibly is the only book I have ever thrown away.
4,Lest we forget....,"This is the first U.S. album released by Jorge Ben, who only changed his last name to Benjor because his and George Benson's royalties were getting mixed up. I have had this album for years and it is most certainly an evergreen in the bossa pantheon. But, as the review title suggests, lest we forget...the musical are arrangements by JT Meirelles, whose group Copa 5 has a grand collection of very tasty discs. Please explore them."
1,Doesn't Taste Anything Like The Original,"Despite what they say, this is NOT the same formula as the original, tastes nothing like it. Don't waste you money."
5,Incredible!!!!,"Simply one of the best people to ever play an instrument. Do yourself a favor and pick up any of his albums or this DVD. But, I will say, watching him play is more fun. I've seen him in convert and he is truly incredible. Great video!"
4,Tommy Emmanuel live at the Sheldon.,This has to be one of the very best Tommy Emmauel has ever done.I am real happy i purchased this DVD.
5,beyond good,"This man is absolutely beyond stunning! He makes me happy, and totally overwhelmed. I've searched for great guitarplayers for 30 years and this is truly a master ... he stands second to none, and is truly incomparable IMHO ...This DVD will bring you endless times of joy and admiration, and also for people like me that actually play guitars themselves it's a bottomless source of inspiration.This is the DVD you should have bought yesterday!:)"
4,"Overall, I like the chandelier but the color is darker","I like the chandelier and have received compliments on it. I saw someone mention that it is darker than it appears online and that is true. So luckily I was not surprised by the color. I was hoping for a little lighter and bronzer shade and it is a very dark brown. Since I have some really dark accents in my dining room, this works out ok."
4,Mali-jazz fusion,"Enjoyable, I liked it, very nice. Mali has more great musicians per capita than Brazil. Buy it today, buy two."
4,Cute,"Arrived as cute as is in picture. The holes are a little on the large side, noodles can easily make their way thru. Overall I am happy with the appearence and functionality."
3,Non-Educational,"I am a Health teacher and I bought this film hoping it would be a great follow-up to my STD's unit. It does a great job portraying the life of teenagers, however, it is not an educational movie.If you are looking for a movie that portrays the peer pressures teenagers face today, this is the movie you need to watch.I was hoping to find a movie that would help educate my students a little more, but there is a lot of other relevance to the movie."
3,No Captions,"The show is fantastic. The writing is top notch, and the actors really settle into their characters early in the series. The chemistry between mom and dad is a little stiff at first, but they warm up to each other around episode 5 or 6. This is a wonderfully funny and dramatic season, but if you are hard of hearing, you will have to turn your TV waaaay up. There are no captions provided for the deaf. That's the only reason I took two stars off of this five star show. I'm criticizing the technology, not the talent."
5,Best TV Show in the last 10 years,"Joan of Arcadia was a fantastic show. It dealt with religion and spirituality head-on without being too preachy or heavy. Joan is a good person, but she's still a real person. She makes mistakes. She disagrees with God. And God is always there reminding her how important she is. It's a good reminder.This was such a good show that I gave up most Friday nights to see it. I planned dinner around it. I left parties early. You have to understand, that I don't watch TV. But Joan of Arcadia was different. All of the characters were likeable yet realistic. God's guidance always hit home. And the conversations between God and Joan felt like conversations I had with God.I hope Season 2 comes out on DVD soon!"
5,I love this show,The first season's episodes and extras. This is a great dvd set to have.This show has shockingly been cancelled. There are petitions to save it.A Web address:http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?arcadia1&1There are over 8400 signatures already. (And that's just one petition)I update this review/ or rewrite it every so often. The signatures on this petition continue to grow.
5,Best Show on Television,"Joan of Arcadia is a wonderful show and the DVD set is great for me, since I began watching the show partway through season one. You don't have to a particular religion or religious at all to take value from the show. The acting is wonderful and there is a lot built in to each episode that is deep, inspiring, and thought provoking. Joan of Arcadia is a gem and is quality TV at its best."
3,Joan of Arcadia - great life lessons,We purchased the season and are very pleased with the message of serving which God calls us all to do.
5,very enjoyable,"I bought both season one and two. I never got to see many of the episodes when it was on tv and in watching a repeat now on tv, I missed them. I bought both seasons. I enjoy the series because it involves a number of emotions: its funny, sad, silly. But most of all I enjoy the characters (actors) and the fact that the family communicates well with each other. We need to see more of that and more shows like that."
5,Amazing show,"Thoughtful, original and inspirational, this show is truly the best to come to television yet. The box set has commentaries with the creator of the series (Barbara Hall) and one with the cast, deleted scenes, information on the different actors that play God, and interviews with the cast and the creators of the show. This Emmy nominated, People's Choice Award winning series is one of my favorite shows of all-time. It asks hard questions and doesn't force any certain religion on you; instead it encourages people to look inward and see what they can do for others."
5,What a great show,"A friend loaned me season 1 to watch. Before beginning, I had never seen an episode of the show, but now I am hooked. I hope season 2 is released on dvd as well.I am saddened to hear that it has been cancelled, and there will be only 2 seasons. I regret that I never discovered this show until now. Watching season one has been a truely enjoyable experience."
5,joan of arcadia,"this series is fresh and gives a refreshing look at a topic of great discussion and mystery..GOD...it is a show that took the risk of being blastphamous and created a touching and very inspiring show,without coming across preachy and offending to people of different faiths.the first year of the series deals with change,moving from a big city to a smaller one,losing faith in god as the eldest son is paralyzed in a car accident,and trying to adjust to a handicapped world.joan of arcadia has away with messages intertwining them so that you see that in reaching just one person in a positive non preaching way a message of love,hope and faith reaches many in even the most insignifigant ways..I love the way god is potrayed here,and believe that the first season was wonderful."
3,At what price?,"While I enjoyed this series when it was on TV and I own the set, I'm not sure why the price for this DVD set in this section is over $130.00. I would hope the reader of this review does another search on Amazon where they will find the 6 disc DVD set for under $25. Again, I may be missing something but it looks the same to me."
5,SOBERVIOUS,"This series go straight from the heart.I don't understand, how CBS cancel this emmy nominated series."
1,Why cancelled?,"Perhaps this show was pulled because maybe, just maybe, someone pointed out that we have enough people doing things that make no sense to others because they think they're talking to God, or Allah, or whatever their flavor of deity is. Religion is for church, home and your own private thoughts, and enough evil morons exploit it for their own ends without TV execs trying to make money out of it too. It certainly shouldn't be rewarded by purchasing this encouragement to confused teens' religious fantasies."
1,"IF ITS SO GOOD, WHY WAS IT CANCELLED AFTER TWO SEASONS?","This show could never measure up to the three best family dramas in television history...""Little House"", ""The Waltons"" and ""Touched by an Angel"" each of which lasted nine seasons. SOmeone must have been doing something right there. Having watched this series I have one question. Why did the audience stay away in droves during the second season thus ensuring its cancellation? If it was so good, why did the audience diminish? This show was nothing more than a teenage soap opera with a lame attempt to theologize (badly I might add). I'm not sorry it was cancelled but I am sorry for those that liked the show. Suffice it to say, if ratings are the indication, I was in the majority ....those who stayed away during the 2nd season."
3,sound quality,Although delivery was perfect sound quality is really bad and there are no closed captioning options. This makes it virtually worthless
3,Wasn't Great But Wasn't Bad Either,"This remix album was basically his ""Don't Be Cruel"" album plus a few hits from his previous self-titled debut.Main reasons to get this CD is the tight remix of ""Rock Wit'cha"" and for ""On Our Own"" (which, until this release was only available on the Ghostbusters II soundtrack album). The rest of the songs are okay but nothing amazing."
3,He danced but who knew it............,"While I will say that Bobby in my opinion is one of the most influential singers in R&B, as well as boy band history the album lacked. The true standouts where Roni, Rock withcha and perhaps on our own. I give a vote of content for every little step though too. I applaud Bobby he does have great vocals but who new this album would lack the enthusiam he displayed with Don't be cruel.All and all I gave it three stars. Being twenty-two listening to the album made me wish he was still with N.E. If you're a fan as am I you'll enjoy at least three or four songs. My opinion but it if you like but Don't be cruel is still number one!"
1,Why no listing of The Best?,Perhaps we need someone to become a whistleblower in Amazon who can then send to Wikileaks what songs are listed on this CD. Or perhaps Amazon considers the content of this CD to be a national secret.
1,Bad piece of software,It's close to the very end of cyberhockey for PCs.If you're a cyber-ice-hockey-fan you've probably bought the game already. Otherwise don't waste your money as NHL06 is bad. Too bad. Online games result in the keyboard/controller lag so if you're playing as a home team you'll most probably loose. Like 1-15 or something like this.By the way all scores are as it's a basketball game.If you play with CPU you can easily score 3 or 5 goals and then you'll get penalties and quickly allow scores of goals in your own net. Usually you can win over CPU but only in the last minutes of the game. The scenario is always ALWAYS the same so it's not just annoying it's disgusting.
4,game was pretty cool,"I am a ten year old hockey player. I would actually rate this game 4 and a half stars. I've played it a lot and you can do a lot of stuff on it like free for all which is sort of practice. I loved to customize my own player and my team. there is also dynasty mode where you can play and be the coach at the same time. I highly recommend this to anybody, especially a sports fan."
1,Can't even play the game,"This is the last game I'll ever buy from EA Sports. Although my computer is not the most powerful in the world, it's not garbage, either. I can play Madden '06 with no problems. Why can't I play NHL '06? I would give this game a minus 10 if I could. Oh, and try to get your money back from EA. The game might be great for all I know but I can't get it to work at all because they say I have an intergrated graphics card on board. So what if I do? They could have still made the game work for people with on board graphics. Their incompetence is noted and I will in no way be robbed by EA again. I do not support them anymore. If you can even play this game, good for you. You just got lucky."
3,Good material questionably packaged,"3 1/2This may indeed be the early essence of one of bop's best guitarists, though hardly constitutes any compilation form away from an attempted cash-out. Purchased unaware and unwilling to invest anymore time into this prolific career however, and you've got yourself a decent synopsis of Benson's young trailblazing ways."
3,"Buy the two albums, not this compilation","Tracks 1-5 of this album come from 'It's Uptown' (1965), and 6-10 are taken from 'The George Benson Cookbook' (1966). Since the two albums have since been remastered, there's honestly not much to recommend this disc. It features a lot of the best tunes, but not all of them. These are excellent straight-ahead / hard bop albums, as you'll find if you check out the sound samples for the original two albums."
4,poems about animals,"This book was written in 1899 and it contains 24 poems about animals. The poems are not educational, they are not teaching facts about the animals. Most poems are 12 lines long, but some are a bit shorter or a bit longer. Hyphens are used to make the poems easier to read for kids. The printed version of this book is 16 pages long.One of the poems is about penguins, and it gives a good indication of what the poems are like:A Penguin.THE Pen-guin sits up-on the shoreAnd loves the lit-tle fish to bore;He has one en-er-vat-ing jokeThat would a very Saint pro-voke:""The Pen-guin's might-i-er than the Sword-fish"";He tells this dai-ly to the bored fish,Un-til they are so weak, they floatWith-out re-sis-tance down his throat.Its a nice little book whith short poems that can be read to young children or be read by themselves by children who are learning how to read. There are no pictures in the book."
5,Excellent images and words,"I borrowed this from our library, having seen the Rivers and Tides video and purchased ""A Collaboration with Nature."" The reason I like this particular edition better is that there are many essays and a lot of reference and bilbiographical material in this one. ""Collaboration"" is almost 100% images (and excellent ones they are) but this volume gives a lot more insight into his methods, and the amazing range of his work. Ideally, I would recommend both books.Keep in mind too thatDisclaimer: I haven't yet seen the ""single-word"" titled series published in the 00s, but I'm eager to see what he's been up to since 1990 (when this volume was published) and 2001 (when Rivers and Tides was released.)"
4,Great case unless you use vibrate,"This is a good looking and well made case for the Treo line of phones. It just did not work for me. I keep my phone on vibrate always. Because my Treo 680 was a little loose in this case, I could not feel my phone vibrate about 90 percent of the time. I actually gave it to my friend who has a Treo 650 and uses a ring tone. He loves it! If you use your phone on vibrate like me, check out the Hard Case for Treo 680/750. Read my review on this hard case!"
2,In Focus,"""Vampire Slayers"" is competently made, and that is all it is. It is not exciting, engaging, comical, frightening or any of the other superlatives listed on the back of the box.Puffery is expected, acceptable, often clever and amusing. But there is a crucial difference between advertising puffery and flat-out lying. If your standard for choosing movies consists of the question ""Is the movie in focus?"" than ""Vampire Slayers"" makes the cut, otherwise don't waste your time and money."
1,review of factory sealed tape,"item was described as factory sealed but plastic film was very brittle when opening, and tape had distint warble sound in several players. Suspect some sort temperature damage occurred over the years. Delivery of product was quick, but very disappointed with product."
5,Greatest Christmas Hits,This CD is wonderful. It brings back memories of more innocent days. I would and have recommended to friends.
4,Great kit but buy a different aspirator,"Excellent kit, that gives you the stuff that you will use except for the aspirator being huge but I'm noticing that most all kits seem to have huge aspirators for some reason. Overall it's a kit that's better than any other I've seen."
2,Not what I expected!,"I liked the contents of this kit. However, the comb, which was one of the things I got the kit for was very impractical to use. It is designed with balls on every other teeth of it and causes the comb to entangle and pull my baby's hair every time I combed it. I guess it might be a safety feature but it doesn't work!"
3,you dont use everthing that comes in there,"Being a first time mom I wasnt sure what all I would need and so bought this. However, you wont need everything that comes in there. I why do you need so many emery boards. Also I like to use a temporal thermometer. and most of the things like thermometer, bulb, medicine dispenser you get those at the hospital."
1,Too Many Negative Reviews,I can't by a product that has too many negative reviews. I can't see it and I am not wasting my time to return it.
2,Not worth it...,"Everyone says these packs are a waste of money but as an expectant mom I REALLY wanted one and had to have one. Just something about feeling prepared I guess. This feels flimsy and poor quality and they gave us better things to take home from the hospital with us than came in this set. The nasal aspirator has a very wide opening that was too large to fit in my daughter's nose. If you buy infant medicine for your baby you can go to the pharmacist and ask them for a syringe, which is much more accurate and is also free. We did use the thermometer and it worked well and we like the comb and brush okay. The nail clippers broke after a few weeks of use. I ended up using this package to store my own things and tossing a lot of those that came with it."
3,Good as a Back-Up,"My daughter is now 4 1/2 months old, and I honestly haven't used most of the products in this set. The brush and comb are fine; I really like the clippers (even though most people wouldn't like them because they are small to hold on to); and the bulb aspirator is far too large to use on my daughter's little nose, so we just use the one the hospital gave us. Other than that, we haven't used anything else in the pack yet, but I do keep this set as a back-up/travel set in the diaper bag, which is pretty convenient."
2,"Overpriced, poor quality","I was not satisfied with this purchase and thought the kit was over priced and poor quality. It looked a lot better online than what actually came. I also didn't like how when it arrived some of the pieces were all jumbled around, I hope it wasn't a return! I would not recommend getting this kit, I think that you can find better quality kits around the same price or less at any baby store."
1,Horrible first aid kit ****Do not buy***,"I have never given 1 star review before, but this item deserve it. I never used anything but the thermometer, and the Ice pack dyed out. The nasal bulb broke before I could ever use it.****** Do not purchase Kit***********Stephanie Hudson"
1,I do not get my order,"I have not my order, send emails to give me answers and nothing, so I will give a bad grade because I have no answers"
4,Mystery and supense in the black waters of Tennessee,"This film is the story of a British college professor who goes for a short fishing trip to Tennessee and gets more than he bargained for. He witnesses the murder of a young woman who has slipped a mysterious package into the professor's car. Next he is chased by the ""bad guys"" without really knowing what they are after. He meets a young black girl who may be involved with the ""bad guys""...you are kept guessing right up to the end of the movie. I thought both Julian Sands and Stacie Dash played excellent roles in this film. I bought a used VHS tape of this movie for $2 and thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,The BEST for fun!,"Beyond Seven's Studded are the BEST I have ever used in 30 years! My wife calls them ""little rain coats"" and even though we don't ""need"" to use 'em anymore, we LIKE to use 'em!! They are an absolute pleasure to put on, wear and use-up! They actually add another dimension of fun!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"At first I saw the movie, and it was... well... O.K. But then I went To the School librarry, and I saw the book! I read the summery on the back and it sounded great! Boy was I ever right, It was great! No not great EXCELLENT!!!! I read the whole thing in about 4-5 days! And let me tell you, it was way better than the movie!Imean, and they ended differently to! In the book there is this boy who realy likes Arial and she hates him! but in the movie...well...the boy that likes Arial ends up being her boy friend! And then they do a big slopy kiss... and ... well you know!"
2,Poorly organized info,"This book has a lot of really good information - some of which I have not been able to find elsewhere. However, it is really poorly organized... I have found that I need to re-read the book several times in order to find the answer to any questions I have."
5,A thorough book on breast milk and health.,"I bought Mother Food for myself as I am a soon to be mommy and found this book to be more than what I expected. It answered all my questions and curiosities about breast feeding health. It should go hand in hand with the La Leche League's The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. They both give power and knowledge to mothers while breast feeding. It's a wonderful guide on staying healthy and covers other topics that may come up during breast feeding including, allergies, colic, depression, and weightloss. You also get holistic recipes and a list of herbal remedies of what to use and when not to use. A great overall book to reference to and pass around to other mothers."
2,"Good information, poorly organized","This book has a lot of great information, but it is poorly organized.For example: if we were having colic problems and wanted to find more information about resolving the issue, I would have to read a few paragraphs out of a few chapters. It would be a much better book if it was easier to reference back to.I wish I knew of a different book to reccomend."
4,A Fascinating Read,"I was hesitant to purchase this book because I thought it was pricey. Let me tell you, it was worth every penny. This good quality paperback is filled with terrific photos and lots of references. Frans de Waal's documentation of the behavior of the Chimps of Arnhem is hilarious and horrifying. I couldn't put it down!"
4,DISTURBING BUT USEFUL,"Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex among Apes was a very disturbing book to read. Perhaps this is because of the way Franz de Waal chose to end the book. The story about how Luit finished his reign as ""alpha male"" was extremely upsetting.One of the key themes in the book is that so called political behavior is rooted at a level of development that is below cognitive and is as much instinctive as it is learned. Learning about the male chimpanzee's quest for dominance, it makes one wonder how much our behavior is motivated by inherent drives that are not only irrelevant in modern cultures, but are unknowable by those who experience the motivation.This book has changed the way I look at and understand the word around me.I strongly recommend this book, but it is not for the faint-hearted."
4,Greatly informs evolutionary psychology,"Chimpanzee Politics tells the story of a colony of chimps in captivity. Frans De Waal observed them for years and soon saw that each chimp had a personality and that there was a definite pattern to their behavior. He shows that they have innate desires and goals and that they act politically to attain them. The astounding thing is that the chimps were seemingly very human in their actions.This book is very accessible and engaging. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, De Waal shows an unquestionable chimp nature at work. It is then not much of a leap to suggest that there is a human nature and that, like the chimps, we act predictably and politically in pursuit of our goals.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in human behavior or evolutionary psychology. It is a great piece of popular science writing that is nevertheless very serious."
4,"Excellent music, but no big surprises.","Clan of Xymox returns with the first live album of their 16+year career, and they've definitely pulled out the stops, featuring 19 songs from their full live show of the '99 tour and 2 video clips, spread over 2 discs. Purists of live albums may not be too impressed as the tracks sound very much nearly the same as their respective studio versions, but songs such as ""A Cry in the Wind and ""Back Door"" which were originally heavily layered tracks, come through quite well in CoX's live quartet format. The recording quality is exceelent, with little in the way of overpowering crowd noise, and the video clips are definitely worth watching. Overall this was well worth the $$."
2,An average book,"I really do not like it when a book has a title which does not reflect what the book is about. The book states that it is a ""no-nonsense guide to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons today"". I would say that about 2/3 of this book is a history of these weapon systems starting from WW1 before it starts to talk about the situation today, which is about 2000.Having said that the book itself is an average history on this topic. No major insights. The information is available in many other books too.The current stuff, is so brief there is nothing that a decent scan though the internet could not produce just as good. Although I am sure since the book been published the writer would have changed some of his comments now."
1,Not very good.,"This book tries to address starting a business and eBay. The result is an all-too-typical superficial treatment of both topics. Annoyingly refers numerous times to another book that I could not locate and does not appear in the bibliography (publications list). The so-called successful eBay sellers used throughout the book (and listed in the appendix) is a bit telling. Half of the 10 listed do not have a current valid eBay userid that matched what was in the book. One ""successful seller"" is mostly a buyer. The most prominently featured ""successful seller"" has more negative feedback than I personally have ever seen and is no longer a registered eBay user. If you absolutely have to read everything on eBay, check this out of your local library."
5,I've seen this book but never received it in the mail.,"After having seen this book on the coffee table of a friend, and after looking through it and coveting it, I wanted to own a copy. I found one on Amazon and ordered it from an English book company through Amazon in December 2010, but it got lost in the mail (aboard Titanic II, from the UK I guess), so I never received it. But the book itself is so beautifully illustrated. It has country homes that I don't see in my other books on Moroccan architecture. I hope to find a copy of this book somewhere soon in the USA because it is a treasure. I don't want to murder my friend to get this book, so I will do the right thing and surf the web for a copy."
2,Only Partially Convinced,I'm some what dissapointed that the author states his doubts and unbelief that God speaks to His children personally. I know He does for He speaks to me and to many other believers i know. I found other parts of the book useful like when the author showed that the Message should be clearly communicated to unbelievers without ignoring parts of the truth.
5,Romance,"John Ringo and Julie Cochrane's collaboration was the start of my Legacy of the Aldenata addiction. And I mean addiction - I then bought and read all the books that preceded Cally's War (A Hymn Before Battle, Gust Front, Hell's Faire, Dance with the Devil, The Hero) in 48 hours. And then I read Cally's War again. Yup, it's that good.So about this book? Well, let's see... romance, redemption, espionage, assassination and internal politics at high speed in typically well-written style. What else could a girl want?A word of warning though. A lot of the subtlety and background is explained in Ringo's previous books - it's difficult to fully understand some of the undercurrents/subplots without having read the other Legacy of the Aldenata books. That said, the book is still a great read without them.And you can always read it again after you've bought the others."
2,Yawn!!!,"I really enjoyed the Posleen Series and was looking forward to reading more. I assumed this book was an epilouge of sorts. I was wrong.It was a dreary story of Cally; 50 or so years in the future. The usual charcters were accounted for but it seemed all so stupid. This book has the feel of some dreadful romance novel. Emabrassing sex scenes, horny protagonist, Fabio look alike, well, there were no Fabio clones, however, I have no idea who the target market for this book is!!!I love Ringo's military fiction; it's the top of the genre. I hope he leaves the romance genre to the Barbara Cartlands of the world."
2,"Intrigue and Violence, no Posleens in Sight","If you like stories of intrigue and violence featuring homicidal nymphomaniacs with large chest measurements, this book is for you. If you want a continuation of the war against the Posleen aliens, it is not.I regret buying this book."
2,And now for something completely different...,"Many prior reviews contain the heart of the matter; this is not a military SF novel. If you want that, spend your money on something else. No one expects an author to write the same stuff for his entire life. The mistake with this novel was positioning. If you don't over analyze human nature, it make perfect sense that there was a great expectation that this novel would tell where the puppet strings lead and how humanity's destiny would play out. To be fed a rather deviant sex story is a tad shocking and disheartening that the larger story will ever be told."
2,Too Much Sex Interfering with a Good Adventure Novel,"I've read this book and ""The Hero,"" both spin-offs from the Posleen wars. I'm personally glad that the Posleen carnage is over. There is only so much you can do with ravening aliens and last-ditch defenses.This was a good read, except for a lot more sex than was needed to sell the story to me. Cally's efforts to deal with her own persona remind me a lot of the problems seen with long-term Special Ops folks. They all get a little ragged around the edges. The Special Ops aspects of the book are great.I must be getting old, but the sexual aspects of Cally's life are very much overdone. I can live without the graphic details. They don't add anything to the story."
3,A Change of Pace,"The latest in the Legacy of the Aldenata, this books skips ahead a few decades and picks up the bio of Cally O'Neal, last seen becoming the deadliest eight-year old on the planet Earth.After destroying the US in order to save it in prior John Ringo books, ""Cally's War"" is a change of pace for the reader - examining the cumulative effects of years of combat, and how someone can ever return to 'normal', while still a participant. I found it adding more to the overall universe, as the earlier books had a lot of 'throwaway' items - kind of like seeing an interesting item on the side of the highway while traveling 65 miles per hour. It was good to see some of those concepts dealt with. ""Cally's War"" ties into the universe, not as a part of the main course, but a good side dish, for those who like the type of item."
1,Total garbage...,"It is unfortunate that, having read the fine books leading up to this one, that I formed expectations regarding how good it would be...Well, I fooled myself. I'd like to say that I only have myself to blame, but it would be a lie. I blame Ringo for pawning off the writing of this book (and the trashing of beloved characters) to someone else. Clearly, he was too busy to come up with something remotely resembling a good plot, so instead turned to pitiful s&m; sex and the torture of women. It has become obvious that John Ringo has some serious issues with women and has let them infect his writing. There is no plot here, unless you count destroying a loyal following of fans. It is too bad that, unlike wine, this author does NOT get better over time.I want my money back. This book is pathetic."
3,My copy must be missing the last few pages,"because I couldn't find the ending. There was a bit that was helpfully labeled ""EPILOGUE"" but it was cryptic and confusing. Almost as if the reader, who has after all bought the book, had no right to an even temporary resolution or explanation. Authors should really have more respect for their readers. They might also have more respect for themselves and confidence in their talent. If you write a good story people will buy it. There is no need for hackneyed cliffhanger endings to juice future book sales."
1,Like harlequin romance?,"If you do you'll be pleased with this turd. Ringo should be embarrassed to put his name near this. Benjamin Dovermann ""Benny"" review is dead on. The Daredevil movie in paperback is good comparison. I am so pissed I spent good money on this trash. Buy this used!!!! Buy it from me!!!"
1,OH - MY - GOD - BAAAAD,"Really this book is not worth a review, however...I have to believe that Ringo received an unsolicited manuscript from Julie Cochrane and thought - what the heck - make money~!Tack the Ringo name on it and let the newbie writer, who has read the Ringo stuff only in addition to pulp bodice rippers carry the load.Abysmal writing style and content is one thing - and this IS that...but many major story and plot failures are another...Notable example: Stewart/Pryce assigned to investigate undercover for a certain and exisiting traitor-leak, but - gosh - turns out that Cally was the spy, and she and Pryce arrived at Titan together~! Huh? What?Save your money...try the Sten series.Those that like this drivel are too easily amused and entertained."
3,Wait for the paperback!,"I loved the first 2 in the series, thought the next ones were pretty good. ""Cally's War,"" on the other hand, seems to be a much slower, less interesting book as compared to the others. The characterizations and storyline are not nearly as indepth as the Mike-centered stories (who, OBTW, is mentioned twice but never appears in this one). My recommendation- fairly interesting read, not worth hardback prices, so wait for the paperback!"
3,Not his best,"Cally reminds me a great deal of Honor Harrington made famous by David Weber in a prominent series she is a Mary Sue; albeit a very likeable Mary Sue.Cally just didn't do it for me although I did like the setting of the story. We get to see what the earth was like after the invasion which can be summed up in two words ""dramatically underpopulated""As a conscience much of the earth seems to be reduced to a frontier style of existence with 21st century technology. The most promising part of the story is the interaction between the human characters and those alien forces who are just as tired of being pawns in someone else's game. I think this plot vain has great potential and would like to see more of it."
2,Boring I had to work to finish it.,"I don't mind that John Ringo didn't write it but I do mind that he doesn't seem to understand that using the same characters in the same world at the same time with his name on the publication would bring in readers who expected at least some of the same feel and expertice. It's not that it is a ""women's book"" which it isn't I read more women's books than men's books since I read a lot of mystery books. The story feels like a short story stretched past the breaking point to fill a novel's space and it feels like a throw away short story instead of a keeper. I was able to explain the story to a friend without him missing anything in 5 sentences and thats light weight. So if you want to keep up with the characters in this series I would wait for a paperback at a used bookstore."
2,anticipation dashed and trashed,"I awaited this book with salivating anticipation, and was truly horribly disappointed. The explicit sex [...] scense really were awful. Cally seemed to spend a lot of time either in bars to pick up strange men, or having sex with various targets. As an asassin, she is excellent, but do we really need all this trash stuff?? It's as if the authors were afraid the book might not sell well without lots of sex. Also, it is not a ""stand alone"" book. You must have read at least one or two of the previous books, which were excellent. This book does not explain just why the B.S. are against the human military, why the aliens are suspect, or just who are these aliens and what is their ultimate goal. I look forward to further Posleen books, not to mention Mr. Ringo's other series. Please, though, leave Cally and her sexual exploits out of any further books. NOT for young readers, which is too bad."
4,Excellent Continuation to the Aldenata Universe,Excellent read. Pulled me in from the first chapter until the last. Fleshed out the world after the Posleen invasion and reintroduced us to an older Cally O'Neal. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys well defined characters and good plots.Beware once you start reading John Ringo books you won't want to stop.
2,Just Blah,"I had mixed feelings about this when I bought it - I already knew it wasn't like the previous books but I did expect better.Firstly, the plot was not sufficiently well connected. The overall picture was fine but the detail was lacking.Secondly, there was far too little romance to make that subplot believable. Ye gawds - Pryce/Steward sees Cally being gang raped and just sits there and watches, despite the fact that she destroyed her chance to escape to save his life. Eww. And then they gratuiously kill Pryce in an accident for no good reason."
1,Poor use of good paper.,"Outstanding illustration of how a proven author can write garbage and still get it published! Cally's War is a pure and simple crotch novel with, at most, 10 pages that might justify its existence. I'd like my $7.99 refund, plus intellectual damages, in a large certified check by 3-01-07 please."
5,Redemption for a Monster,Make sure you have plenty of time to finish this book. Once its sucks you in its not going to let you go till the last page. These are NOT your usual SF secret agents. Then again given that Evanescence helped to inspire the authors....
2,A sadly disappointing sequel.,"I really did not care for the general tone of this book, of the Bane Sidhe using women as weapons in the manner portrayed. I'm really not a fan of the Marquis de Sade, either. The book drifted a bit too far from normal SF violence into another realm. Sad!"
4,"A Softer, Gentler Side of John Ringo (with a little help!)","The body count is significantly lower in this latest installment in the world of the Posleen. It's 40 years after the end of Hell's Faire and while most of the world thinks we've won, Cally Oneal still fights on against the real enemy, the Darhel.40 years is a long time to be in battle, especially as a secret agent and assassin and it's beginning to wear Cally down. Unfortunately she's the only one who can't see it and is getting frustrated at everyone telling her to get a life!But they say there's someone for everyone and there's someone for Cally at Titan Base. But there's a little problem to live through first........A great collaboration with John providing the military realism and newcomer Julie Cochrane giving Cally heart and soul. Worth the read just to get Cally's line on what she thinks of herself!"
2,Disappointing,"After an explosive opening, this story wanders off into meaningless details and events. There is so much wasted space between the covers, that when the climax finally comes near the very end, it's hard to remember who some of the players are. The climax seems rushed, as if someone had to meet a publisher's deadline or some such. The ending itself is just a bit too convenient and a bit too cryptic.There are some scenes with the mysterious Bane Sidhe (hint, this is pronounced Banshee in English), but we really learn nothing useful about the group. Nor is there any meaningful detail about what has been happening since the cavalry arrived (aka the Fleet) and ended the Posleen incursion on Earth in one afternoon (slight exaggeration), some forty years earlier.If you skip this entry in Aldenata series, you won't notice the omission. Speaking of which, when the heck are we going to find out more about the Aldenata, and learn who engineered the Posleen (they can't be natural), and why?"
1,disappointing,"After reading the first four books in the Posleen series, this book fellFar short of ringo's writing.I think the author (Cochrane) tried to cover up the lack ofQuality science fiction with a glut of sexual encounters. YouBegin to think that they are never going to end.This will be the first and last book I will read with herName on the cover!BD"
2,"From Virgin to Ho, faster than u blinked","The sex doesn't bother me at all...the scenes are pretty good. The profanity isn't an issue...it fits. The lack of battles/gore isn't a problem, it wasn't part of this story.But what I really didn't like was fast-forwarding past all the years of Cally's life (from 13 to 53). I wanted to pick up and follow the development of a good character, but instead got tossed in with a late-middle-age nympho who feels that good ""tradecraft"" involves using 4 completely different personnas/identities like a revolving door, right out of her own door and about her town.Oh, and somehow all these ""rule-breakers"" just never figured out a way to let dad know his kid and father were still alive. Whatever.Not badly written, by no means unreadable, but also the last I will be reading in this series."
1,too little meat to story,I was looking forward to expanding my understanding of the challenges and intrigue in the new post Posleen universe not a wooden and boring hash. In the earlier novels we glimpse many interesting characters and motives. I was hoping to flesh out these hints only to be very disappointed. I think I'll pass on the next novels
2,The consequences of selling your name,"This book cannot have been written by the same author as A Hymn Before Dying. It's absolutely terrible. Wooden, badly plotted and amateurish. All I can hope is that the co-authorship meant that Ringo simply sold off the characters and the basic background to another writer who wrote a hacked-up melange of romance novel and dumb science fiction.Yech."
1,Porn? or S/M?,"After some interesting ideas in the preceding 'Posleen' war books, we are down to some plain old porn and S/M. Dull, dull, dull."
1,Poorly written TRASH,I enjoyed the other Ringo novels but this book seems to only have Ringo's name on the cover. The book takes place thirty to forty years (remember rejuv treatments) in the future. Cally is an assassin who is lucky she can do a clean kill. Not much about the aliens except as a side issue. Sex seems to be on the author's mind and the somewhat pornographic desciptions seem to be out of place. Could have been a great book if the secret agenda of the Darhel was developed. Only a few killings of their agents and a couple of cameo appearances was it. Not much else. Recommend you save your money on this one.
1,"Well written, but Cally's War is mis-titled; there is no ""war"".","John Ringo's comments and feedback were good to read. I don't know if I speak for a majority of reviewers, but the title and the cover art lead us to believe that there will be Posleen blood shed at some point.If you're looking for an in-depth view on the life of a spy - a mid-aged, female, expert spy - then this is a great book. Well written. Just be ready for a spy novel."
2,Too Girly,"There was way too much attention paid to her changes of clothes, and not enough action, like other Ringo books. The ending was very anti-clamatic, and lackluster. Please John no more of this type, get back to action."
2,Not for me.,"I was unable to finish reading this book. Cally was preoccupied having one night stands and shopping. What happened to the war?In all fairness I only made it halfway through the book, maybe the second half was better."
2,Couldn't Finish,"Prior to this book, I hadn't read anything by John Ringo. So I had no expectations of what the book was or should be other than one with good action and a kicka$$ leading lady. I had no problem with the sex nor with the, well, only implied sadism. What I did have a problem with was the disjointedness of the plot. (Was there a plot?)The book got off to a great action start then fizzled with page after page after page with details of Cally's daily life. As another reviewer pointed out Cally seemed occupied with her clothes, hair and sex. Fine. I don't have a problem with this character development if the story is going somewhere. But it didn't. If it did, it was moving at a snail's pace.Maybe I gave up too early around page 100. But all these details didn't seem to have a point other than to add to the final word count. And I just couldn't take it anymore."
2,Wait for paperback if you have to have it,"It defintely is a change from the previous posleen books. They were all action and violence, while this one is more subtle and delves into the main character's psyche a lot more. The major problem i have with it is the cost. It's just not long enough to justify spending 25 or even 16 dollars on it. And I just couldnt get into this idea of having a spy take the role and the body of another person. Its too convient."
1,"What's your problem, Ringo!","You start with a character that was shaping up to be really fun and full of potential at the end of Hells Faire. A girl with excellent bloodlines, training, and fun to boot. Cut to the beginning of the book and she has become a total tramp who uses her body like a garbage disposal and cannot be respected by the other characters in the book let alone the reader. Boy, her honorable dad and mother sure would be proud. Why, I think we all hope our daughters could turn out like her. Way to go Ringo, I dropped this dog after 60 pages."
3,They only list one disc! Caution!,"I don't understand, amazon only lists the contents of disc two here, at a price of around $50 this can not be.I reviewed Havana Jam I, this has some of the same artists, but seems more geared towards Jazz and other instrumentals, with Weather Report and John McGlaughlin's Trio of Doom.Questions remain on what one would be getting on this cd, but rest assured, the Havana Jam series has excellent music, yet, much more costly, than what I might expect. If interested in this music, you may wish to check the Havana Jam I page.Because of lack of info, and that I can not just give it no stars, I place it right in the middle with 3 star.Weather Report or/and McGlaughlin completists may wish to purchase these discs however, for their collections. The performances will not let you down and they are presented in a very rich context."
3,Monitor Adaptor,This turned out to not be what I needed.Returning the product was a hassel and I still have not received my refund.I also got my debit card number stolen after making this purchase and mychecking account was hit with an unauthorized charge in Las Vegas.
4,Excellent resource!,"I used this text as part of a Risk Management course, and I expect to use it in practice. It's an excellent resource for risk managment tools. Especially for quantifying financial risks."
2,Cracked up @ bottom,The Jar has started cracking up at the base after just 2 washes in the dishwasher..I did not expect that from an Oster product..as most of its parts are very dishwasher friendly.Otherwise the jar is good for grinding fresh spices etc needed for Indian cooking.
2,Mini jar,"Did not like plastic lid. Did not realize, when ordering, it was an ""off"" brand and not an official Osterizer part."
1,Doesn't fit!,"This jar DID NOT fit my oster blender. It looks cheap but I didn't mind since it was priced appropriately. But I was shocked to find out it doesn't fit. I have a regular Oster blender - nothing special, not from the intuition range (or whatever it's called). So it's not like I bought the wrong thing. If you have a new blender this may not fit. beware!"
5,Good for experienced cooks,"Very authentic cook book. THough it lacks color pictures, if you are familiar with these dishes you will not need them. Flavors are very familiar to what my parents would cook- easy instruction though recipes are time consuming (inherent in the recipes not the authors writing). Get this book to cook a wonderful meal on the weekends and if you have access to these ingredients"
2,recipes not authentic,"I purchased this recipe book expecting authentic recipes, but after viewing some of them, I saw that the recipes were Americanized, especially the ""shaking beef""."
1,Disappointed!,"I must admit, I really like Mai Pham's first cookbook ""the best of Vietnamese and Thai cooking."" So the minute I saw ""Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table""I bought a copy right away. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with this one. Besides the culture and history aspects, which I am not looking for mainly in a cookbook, I find her recipes in this book too tedious and complicated. Furthermore, I tried two recipes (Hue beef vermicelli soup and tofu, tomato and chile soup)and both did not even taste too good. I decided to give the book to my friend, a great fan of Vietnamese food. She returned the book to me after two weeks because she cannot find half the ingredients called for in the book. Since my friend and I are not hardcores when it comes to ""authentic"" ethnic foods, this book is definitely not for people like us."
1,over rated,"I find this cookbook highly over rated. Frankly, I am not interested in the author's personal stories, which had been mentioned over and over already in her first cookbook. Her recipes require too many ingredients, most of them are not easy to find. In short, I don't find this cookbook useful at all."
4,AT&T 50ft flat line telephone cord,It is not dove gray but a dull cream color - so thin it tangles easily but does the job intended.
5,50 phone cord,the 50foot phone cord is of good quality and serves the purpose for which it is intended.
4,Amazing and Fun filled,I have a friend who likes this game. I thought It was really cool the graphics were really cool. It is a game I will buy one day. I give it a 4 star rating. It would be 5 if it was made for computers! When or if it comes out for a computer then I will definetly buy. Or have my parents buy it for me!!
3,crap,definately the worst FF in the series. i don't mind the cartoony graphics but the story was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. it was sooooo boring and the game was too easy. there were hardly any fun side things to do. i didn't like FF 8 much either but it's definately better than this one.
5,They've done it again!,"Well, Squaresoft did it again, what most thought could not get better, got better, way way better. This game is the epitamy of cool for the playstation."
2,This Games BAd,Im writing this to tell you that this game sux. The charaters look like kids one of the the charaters is a chicken and the story is bad. Im just saying square when down after making good games like ff7 and ff8 those had good storys and cool graphices. But ff9 has none of those elements. I was very disapointed to see this game like this. The best i could give this game was 2 stars.
4,game,I honestly don't even remember ordering this haha. But I'm sure it was a fun game. I have not seen it in a while.
5,Awesome!,I've played all of the FF classics and I have to say this has always been one of my favorites along with VII of course! I played this game when it was released and jumping back into it now just rekindles my love for the FF series.Thank you FF
4,"The last ""true"" Final Fantasy...","This is the PSX last Final Fantasy game and what a roller coaster ride it is. This game does not dissapoint. The story will draw you in and never let go. I have to admit I am a little dissapointed with the Ablility System but other then that a truley remarkable game. Also Final Fantasy XI has one of the best endings I have ever witnessed at the end of an RPG, very satisfying. If you're a fan of Final Fantasy games you owe it to yourself to play this incredible game, to others I say go ahead and jump on the Final Fantasy 7 bandwagon, that is if you havent already."
5,Personally my favorite PSone Final Fantasy game,"Wow, this is how game should be made, the graphics in this game are topnotch for the PSone with tons of cut seens and excellent animation. It was nice to see the Final Fantasy series return to it's roots with FF9. Not there was anything wrong wuth FF8 but 9 just has such a stronger RPG feel to it than the previous FF8. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs although anyone who likes RPGs should already have this game. The PSone is definetly the place for FF fans with FF7-9 Chronicles,Anthology,Tactics, and the soon to be released Origins which features FF1&2."
3,there are better games,"well,i thought this game was quite interesting at fist but then it just got too long,the storyline was becoming reallly confusing,the characters werent opening up,and the characters were not all introduced in disc one.final fantasy 8 had characters worth caring about,they were all introduced in disc 1,and they were all normal size!i thought each final fantasy was supposed to beat the previuos one.guess that does not stand true after 8.i thought the graphics were good,but graphics do not make the game.the attacks of some of the monsters had really bland names,like for instance...""head"",""anttenna"",and my favorite""left tentacle"". all though i am not happy with this game,it is my opinion and you can definately dissagree with me."
4,A great game,squaresoft did it again! they managed to make another great FF. although i did like a few other FF's more than this one.. and i do have to admit i bought it with great hopes that it would be the best and it sort of let me down. But if you buy it.. dont expect it to be OMG WOW! because u may be let down but other than that i loved it to death and would buy it in a second
4,ummm...,"as a game this is awsome, it is fun, has a pretty good replay abality, and the story isn't that bad. But before giving it five stars you have to compare it to the rest of the series and basically it doesn't live up to it's predecessors. It tries to go back to the original final fantasy's with the game play, but because of this it is unoriginal and a little bit played-out. It might be unfair to try and compare it to the rest of the series, but this game seems to try and get by on name sake and unless your a die-hard ff fan or else are positive you really want this game, go out and try FF VI or VII because I assure you they are much better"
5,Greatest Final Fantasy To Date,"I have kept up with the great Final Fantasy series since it started, and I have to say this is the best so far. And I love the abilities system (especially auto-regen).So what else can I say except if you're a fan of RPGs and have played Final Fantasy before, you will not be disappointed with FF9. BUY IT!"
4,2nd best Fantasy,"While I haven't purchased this game from Amazon or any other sales location, nor do I plan to, I Have purchased the Japanese edition of the game where the challenge is even more promising in-spite of my knowledge of the language. It is an Awesome game! I've seen so much more than I'd seen when I had sampled the U.S. version, despite not completing the game, yet. Not that there is more but I missed a lot of my initial play through of the U.S. version. I've been playing it long enough that I'm going to miss a few items within my 1st official play through of the game. But I thought it slightly better than it's immediate predecessor. Though, the original VII and It's own Several spin-off games are a testament to how much fun and enjoyable It is. I'd recommend that anyone at least sample this game like I initially did. Happy Playstationing! God Bless."
5,This game's sweet!,"I haven't bought it yet, but I've played some of it, and this game is sweet! The graphics are awesome, it's got a great storyline, it's the most addictive Final Fantasy ever, and being the hardcore gamer that I am, I've played all of them, even the ones from Japan, except for the ones that were released on Gameboy, because I had doubts about them, plus they aren't part of the series anyway, just spinoffs. I have been with it through its best (FF7), its worst (FF2 for NES), and its good (all the rest), and this game dethrones Final Fantasy VII as the best Final Fantasy ever!"
4,"The ""inbetween"" Fantasy","I would rate this game as being better than FF8, but worse than FF7. I liked the fact that they went back to the old look of FF. The battle system wasn't all that great, but the music and story were decent enough. Just go buy it."
3,Stick with FF7&8,"I was quite dissapointed with this game in the series of FF. Graphics were great and all, but it was slow, and it kind of just dragged along. Dull, too. I liked how you could have 4 characters to fight, and that they all had their own talents or whatever. Trances (limits) were awful, they were almost annoying. And movies are great, but I want to play, ya know? There was a movie every other hour, and I finished the stupid game in like a week!But it wasn't all bad. I liked how they moved a lot, not just stoof there, and I liked how it ended. The characters were also cool, and all very individual. They were kind of weird lookin', but I guess it adds to the other oddities. (Man, their clothes...?) Oh, and the music was pretty too.All in all, it was an okay game, but if you are going to get a FF game, get 7 or 8."
3,Final Fantasy IX... Just the facts,"Final Fantasy IX - Circa 1999GOOD:- Recaptures classic NES Final Fantasy theme on PS1- Some nice CG movies in between gameplayBAD:- Graphics are pretty dated- Not considered as classic to many as Final Fantasy VI, VII, or XIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Turn based RPG- No voice-overs, so there is lots of reading- Card Battling as a mini game- Super-Deformed look for the characters turned off a lot of peopleGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Final Fantasy VII- Final Fantasy VIII- Legend of Dragoon- Chrono CrossADDITIONAL NOTES:- All Final Fantasy are not related to one another, think of each Final Fantasy a it's own game not connect in any real/true way to another Final Fantasy, the only exception is Final Fantasy X-2 which is a sequel to Final Fantasy X"
5,Best Game On Earth,"The game FF9 was a great game. So many different ways to attack, so many cool characters. Most of all that was best was the length. This game kept me busy for hours on end. I never got bored."
5,A masterpiece.,"FF9 - it goes back to the old ""character classes"". The characters are no longer exactly the same, like FF8. They have unique abilities and magic that they, themselves can do. The plot, centered mostly around Zidane, is well done. All of the characters learn from Zidane and ultimately care about him in the end. I don't want to give too many spoilers for the people who don't have FF9, so get it and see if you like it.~)Bune"
5,Final Fantasy IX,I thought that this game was one of the best in the series. It had an interesting magic system and very good graphics. One thing that I didn't like about the game was when I got my Playstion 2 the graphics didnt seem as good as on the first playstation. I don't really know maybe it was just me. I would recomend this game to anyone.
4,2nd Fav. Final Fantasy game behind number 8,"Another great game from Squaresoft. Great gameplay and thousands of side-quests to keep you amused for months. The storyline in itself is sometime so absorbing that when your up at 3am playing instead of studying for your Government final, you forget its a game."
5,Wow!,"This game was awesome. Graphically it was gorgeous for the PS1 platform and the sound was well designed, too. Very whimsical and lighthearted in its design which made this very refreshing for the franchise. It was nice to play a Final Fantasy game that was not as dark and serious as some of it's predecessors (i.e. FFVII). This one lengthy game that definitely will warrant being played more than once."
5,FF9--back to the basics,"FF9 brings back everything we used to know and love about previous final fantasies--the black mages, the summoners, actual character classes, and a great story. Not to knock FF7 or 8, which were great games (especially 7), but there weren't really any solid character classes in them--the materia system in 7 means anyone could do anything. It's a classic reborn."
4,Challenging Game,"I have loved Final Fantasy games for a long time. So when I saw this game I just had to have it. It,s game strategy is similar to the Final Fantasy VIII strategy. A new feature is the treasure hunt game by the chocobo. The characters are humanized animals, which is quite a cute approach. It is difficult and tough to proceed at certain parts in the game, so I stopped playing the game, kind of put it on ice, haha. It is a good game if you can get all the way through. I don't know why they make games so hard to solve sometimes, or is it just me?"
4,great game,it was the first final fantasy game i played and instantly became a fantasy lover. Best game i have ever played. hope you(the buyer) enjoy the game as much as i have. have fun and let the game be a fun one
5,.,"the overall gameplay was excellent, especially for a psone game. The graphics and cut-scenes were really good."
5,Great game,"The last time I played Final Fantasy was summer 2001. I finished 8 and i was ready for 9. When it came out i forgot and nver played it. Finallu though last week I rented it and i was entranced once again. I think this is the best Final Fantasy i have played (havent played 6 so i dont know about it) The gameplay and graphics are superb. I cant put it down, i come home from school and Im on it till 11."
4,The Best Yet,"Fian Fantasy 9 has go to be the best one out of the series so far. The graphics on this one are far superior to the previous outings, as they seem more crisp and and there is more attention to detail. The control method is the same as in the previous ones so any of the old fans will be able to jump right in from the start. There are plenty of new weapons and new magic which eill keep any fan happy until Fianl Fantasy 10 comes out on Playstation 2 (I cant wait)"
5,Squaresoft's done it again!,"I've only played FF VII and VIII before and they both rock! But this one is totally different. Even though all the characters before has been great, these take home the award. Enough about that...the story is awsome and the fights aren't as simple as in 7 n 8.I can't believe how emotional these games are! They're the only games I think aren't shallow. I love the games and I hope that the production never ends and that it only gets better, though I'm not sure if it can get any better. I've spent every night trying to find hidden stuff and new accesories and of course, I've gone further, too! I just needed to say how much they've done for me...My life ain't too big of a mess anyore! Thank you, Square!!! (Quina rox!)"
3,Producer should think a little bit more in everybody's taste,"FF9 is quite and impressive game, but producers are playing an ""extremist"" game here... if FFVIII was ""too much for adults"" I personally can say this FFIX is too much for kids. The story is not deep as other FF storyes, most of the characters can't just be at the level of the situation (When Zidane knows the meaning of his dark existence, he just think about it 2 minutes and then he acts like nothing has happen, and then that whole situation is forgotten...). When I play FF9, I think producers rush too much the game, and it really picks up in the middle of the third disk (too late to be remembered as a great game... or at least for me)."
5,"ff7,ff8 no way you need FF9","ff9 is the best sure ff7and ff8 were OK.And we've got to give these two creditYet 9 is the best.Come on think of the easy battle scenes and of course the awsome charachters Zidane is so cool,once Garnet learns some more white magic than cure and shes got some summons watch out for the stongest princess ever,Vivi is the best black mage i've ever seen,Steiners sword magic is the best,and of course we have to give Blank the bravest charachter award(not really I just like Blank).This has such a good plot.It's a challenge(espesialy the Black Waltz 1,2,and 3.)FF9 is the greatest!Get it!!!!!!!!!"
5,An RPG Masterpiece,"If you like RPGs than you should definitely buy this. It has adventure, romance, great graphics and much more. I have only played this one in the Final Fantasy series but I can't imagine the others being better. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy, than you would probably know the battle between the Final Fantasy series and the Zelda series. I think that both of them are good, but in different ways. I like how in Final Fantasy how you can use magic spells but I like Zelda's battle techinque. I would definitely recommend both games."
5,"Buy it, now!!","Yes, just like any other Final Fantasy's..(except 8 wasn't.... quite right.) simply the best. What more can I say? It has everything you can possibly want for a game(not just an RPG game.) Graphics, story line, characters, everything, is simply amazing! You a fan of FF series! run to the store now! If you are not, run to the store now!"
3,WAY WAY TO EASY,This is the easiest game in ff. The only reson it gets 3 stars is because of Vivi and Bahamut
4,GREAT FUN BUT LACKED THAT CERTAIN FEELING A GREAT RPG GIVES.,"FF9 is possibly one of the best rpg's ever but some parts in the game were just plain stupid. For instance the Festival of the Hunt. All you do is run around fighting low level creatures and the prizes that you get are hardly worth the trouble. Also the atb system gets very annoying.Although it is a real time saver how the commands are already chosen for you and you don't have to waste a command to draw magic. Plus the story is a lot more interesting because it unfolds as you go along and doesn't give you any real early hints to who the BIG BOSS is unlike other final fantasies I know(cough,ff8). Also the animated cinemas are twice as beautiful as its' predecessor and the regular graphics are better,too. This is a definite must have for people who like good graphics,a gripping story, and the atb style of fighting.(Though I am sure there are many people who don't like the last one.)"
4,a grate fun game,"I admitt that this game can be boring at times but it is very addicting. This is the kind of game people like, they are just afraid to admitt it. But I liked this game and I think it needs to be given more of a chance."
3,Kind of a let down ...,"I have to say this is not one of the best FF games. Although FFVIII was complicated overall it is a better play than FFIX. The characters in this game seem directed towards a younger crowd and it is hard to really get into the story. It seems that Squaresoft was trying hard to recapture the feel of FFVII and they fell way short with this game. However, that is not to say that it isn't an ok game. There are some positive aspects, for example the graphics are great, it's just not as good a game as I expected."
2,"8 rubbish,this good?","im sorry,but the person who put down number 8 is servierly incorrect.i bought this game when it first came out and took it back a couple of days after due to the firm belief that it was indeed aimed at young children.everything about it was,well,crap.the boss battles were comically simple,with the player left baffled with the limited options you have.attack attack repeat until dead.ff8 was a masterpiece,like 7.there was a plot to it,it just took time to understand,it was more complex.......not a simple 'save the princess' story.the characters in this game were terrible.for children.im gonna pick this up again cheap,to give it another chance,it was years since i played it,but i dont think il change my opinion."
2,Final Fantasy IX,"I have to admit, the Final Fantasy series is amazing! But Final Fantasy IX to me, wasn't so interesting...I admit it was a fun game, but it had TO MANY love seens with Zidane and Garnet! The battling is cool and the graphics are awesome, but it didn't attract me good..."
2,Reduced quality,"Where is the quality from the last game Final Fantasy VIII?I mean the game doesn't interest me at all in the beginning, it is too manga and comic relief inspired, and has no real seriousness about it. This makes this a less ""hardcore"" experience than the Final Fantasy 8.I miss the depth in the characters, and I also miss the complex story that was so evident in 7, and 8. Bad game! I just hope they increase the dark feel of the next game, because this one was too goodie goodie for my taste."
3,There are better Final Fantasies.,"This could have been so much better. Sure, it is a treat for the eyes. And Steiner and Vivi rule. The game has many parts that will make you laugh so hard you'll wet your pants. But there are things that keep this from being truly great. The plot really starts to sag halfway through disk 3. I expect more than that of an FF. Limit breaks are sacrificed for the inferior ""Trance."" And you learn abilities from your equipment (?). But glaring points aside, this is still worth at least a rent from casual FF fans. But for the hardcore (like me) you'd be much better with FF 6-8. Trust me."
5,A great game,"Like all FF games, this had a different battle system. Summons are an important part but not as important as FF VIII. Now, the main nine guys learn skills from the items they equip. The bad thing is that only two people can summon creatures and use white magic (healing magic). Also, only one guy can use black (attack) magic. The graphics are kind of weird but not in a bad way. The weapons now can be bought as well as made from other materials. I find that fun. I did find the game a little easier than the other FF games though. The one bad thing is that if you want to get the best weapon for one of your characters, you have to reach a certain point in disk 4 within 12 hours."
2,Too Short,"Unlike other RPGs, this one is very short and it is the shortest RPG I have ever played. There's not many bosses in this game and not very much puzzle solving. This game lack any adventure in it. Not many places to explode. I love the final fantasy games, I expected this game be as long as VII & VIII. I beat this game one month. The other final fantasy games, took me months to get pass disc 1."
4,Not to bad.,"To be honest I kinda shocked in how well of condition the game was in. There were no marks on it all. It looked brand new. I was happy about that. Wasn't happy that my PlayStation 2 couldn't read the disk. I had to play new one day. Then I had to buy a PlayStation 1 memory. So not to happy that this is costing me a lot more then thought, but over all on the game it's great. Reminds me when I was kid again. Thanks!"
5,Final Fantasy 9,"The game came 2 days before the expected day. All 4 discs work and came as described, dusty but without scratches and a small crack on the case but all 4 work just fine. Haven't finished the game yet but its awesome so far. Would definitely buy from this person again."
5,One of the best games ever...,"I first played this game about a month ago,and I think that Final Fantasy IX is one of the best games ever.The game starts with a great 3D cutscene,and the music in this game is so good,it is some of the best music you will ever hear in a video game.This game is even better then 'The Legend of Zelda:Ocarina Of Time',and that game is very fun.Half the fun of Final Fantasy IX is the story.The only problem with this game is that some of the names of the heros are very weird and hard to pronounce,also this is the game that started the 'check out her!' in Final Fantasy games,but yeah Garnet is hot(veeery hot).So over all if you ever played any 'Final Fantasy'games,you will love this one."
5,One of the best games I have ever played.,"Final Fantasy IX is undoubtedly one of the best games I have ever played, Almost everything about it is done perfectly, The Plot, The gameplay, even the graphics. It has some amazing CG Cinemas and Alot of things that keep you wondering ""Why?"" Until Certain parts in the game. All of The characters are very lovable especially Vivi. And Square has (thank god) switched back to the Magic points system instead of the draw system. This Game totally turned me from hating RPG's to loving them. If you like RPG's, BUY THIS GAME, If you don't rent it and then BUY IT!!!"
5,Awesome,I used to have this game a long time ago and somehow lost it through the years. Can't really find it on a store shelf anymore so I was exited to find it here. Awesome game if you like the Final Fantasy series
5,My reveiw Final Fantasy IX,Final Fantasy IX is the most weird insane and brilliant final fantasy game yet. The cut scenes are amazing and so is the sheer quality of the graphics through out. The story line is interesting but easy to follow. Vivi is my favourite character but each character has its own backround and emotions about them. over all 5 stars!
5,A great game!,"I bought this recently from Amazon and I found this game to be extreamly fun. The controls are different from other games. The plot is well made and the characters are all unique. This game could turn a frown upside down in a heart beat with the great Chocobo side quest. Yes its frustrating but who doesn't love to ride a Chocobo around the world. The battle system is in my opinon a tad bit slow. I played FFVIII before this game and I compared the battle systems and after you enter an action with IX it takes a while before that action is taken. While on the battle system because of the ""delay"" battles with bosses can be quite frustrating when you trying to heal and the boss gets an attack before you can heal and kill the person."
4,comment to make how the final fantasy become reality,"actually...my favourite is final fantasy and diablo... but to be honestly, to be an adventure best game among the best games is need a voice system (instead using a lyrics /typing words before ). It is ok with lyrics as we can see in other games (such as Diablo ) but not too frequently use for each slot. use in certain way like the DEMO between playing games from one level to another level or when in important tasks to do... i hope this will help you....that all.. thanks..."
5,Ooops! They did it again!,"This game was such a comeback for Squaresoft! Although I personally loved FF8, I know quite a few people who didn't. Then Squarsoft came out with number 9 and all was forgiven. If you haven't jumped on the Final Fantasy bandwagon yet, now is the perfect time to do so. The graphics are outstanding, the storyline engaging and the gameplay is as good as it always was. People, I could sing FF9's praises until you're all deaf, and it wouldn't do the game justice. Just buy it, you'll love it!"
3,Still one watt short of a light bulb if youre a veteran!,"OK, this game was one of the best games I had, but its not really good to me anymore. I think that this game was basically made to get people into Final Fantasy that never played before. Its really easy for the veterans like me, the battle system is too easy to know, and not really a good one compared ot others (thank god it beats FF8's)."
4,great!,this was the 3rd final fantasy game i've played... i have enjoyed every single one so far! this is one of my favorites.. probably second.. :Dthe story is different compared to the other final fantasies but it's still very interesting! really enjoyed playing it again.. after... 7 or 8 years.. really worthwhile! yeah!
3,This game is not for everyone...,"I absolutely detested this game. To be fair, the graphics are beautiful and the game is well done. However, the learning system was too simple. I didn't mind having characters that couldn't develop into other areas of attack, such as vivi only doing magic. What I did mind was that there were so many characters that you never really got to know any of them. Also, the characters lacked substance and instead were ""fluffy"" and too cute. To me, Final Fantasy is NOT a child's game, and that is what this one was made into....I realize that the game is graphically very progressed for its time, and thats part of the reason I love final fantasy. But, overall, I'm glad X, X-2, and XII are out now."
5,Classic,Another Square Soft Classic. best PSX graphics out of any Final Fantasy. Good story and sidequest. A+
3,"sorry for rating low, but it wasn't good","no this wasn't good at all. I don't like the fact that Eiko and Garnet are supposed to have ""horns"". Queen Brahne is seriously ugly. Although this was okay for a PlayStation game if you know what i mean. i still like FFVIII and FFVII more than this, and of course i like FFX a WHOLE LOT more than this. Steiner, Adelbert Steiner, ring a bell? doesn't that name have a surprising resembleness to Albert Einstein? i'm sorry for saying it's bad, but still this game is OK. not the worst, it's not THAT dramatic like FFVIII and FFX and FFVII so i'm not happy. but still this game is OK. it's worth a try, although i don't see me playing this again. i like the fact that you get to name every character, that's pretty awesome..."
2,Another long nail in the coffin of story-driven RPGs.,"If you like your RPGs contrived or if your intelligence and maturity levels are forever arrested at an adolescent age, then you'll surely love Final Fantasy 9. Don't be fooled (though it's obviously too late for that) by this game's deceptive marketing touting a ""return to the style of early Final Fantasy"" because the only similarity between this game and, say, Final Fantasy 2, was my feeling like an eight-year-old when playing both of them. If you like overt, heavy-handed, overly simplistic dialog (and most of you bought 7 so I assume that you do), then this game will serve it up for you disc after uninspired disc. Get yourself a Vagrant Story or a Suikoden or some well-orchestrated Baldur's Gate for the PC. Or don't. It's your eighty-some-odd hours."
3,Horrible fight system,"The story was OK, I was not taken away with it since it's the usual ""Last of species, princess in trouble, hero with daddy-problem"" stuff.The characters had some personality, it was never developed beyond looking like comic characters, I just never took them seriously.The graphics are ugly, I do not like that they are so small, I could barely see Vivi.But the absolute worst part is the battle-system, it almost takes a whole minute just to load all the characters, monsters and angle the camera correctly.So much time is wasted just wating for the battle to load.So when you meet weak monsters you kill with a blow, you seriously get more than annoyed because it takes longer time to load the fight than to actually finish it!Sad way to ruin a possibly could be fantastic game."
2,Worst Final Fantasy Game ever,"I have played every Final Fantasy game and this is by far the worst of them. I hurried through the game to get to the end so that I could say that I have beat it. I didn't even do the side quests do to the fact that the game sucked so bad. The story line lacked in all areas and the characters were horrible. I am ashamed that squaresoft put a Final Fantasy name on the game. Only buy this game if you are trying to complete a Final Fantasy collection, otherwise it isn't worth the money."
2,not quite good enough,"The series of psx disappointments continues. FF 7 was fun but not really a Final Fantasy game, FF 8 was fun enough to finish (intresting how the limit break system was just a less random one of final fantasy 3/6's) and now 9, well 9 was the first final fantasy game that I will not be finishing. It's sad, but the story is neither gripping nor exciting. The creators tried to recapture the greatnest of FF 6 but failed miserably, the humor is well [bad]. The dialogue is one of the few average parts, and the graphics were just a FF7 and FF8 mix."
2,This GAme...,"i hate this game. The Characters are too young- i mean Zidane and Dagger are 16!! also, Zidane is a pretty flat character compared to squall, and garnet is ugly compared to rinoa. and look at the field characters! What happened to the tall, detialed characters from FF8? The only reason im giving this 2 stars was because of the music scores. in my opinnion you should buy FF8 first. Better graphics, etter everything.FF8 Forever :)(:"
4,One of the best Final Fantasy games out there.,"After playing final fantasy VII religiously for a very long time (and HATING Final Fantasy VIII) I decided it was time to give Square another chance. They deeply wounded me with Final Fantasy VIII. I played it for a total of about 4 hours before I sold the game to some poor sap I knew at the time. Final Fantasy IX, however, was 1000% better. The combat system is polished and intuitive. The story is engaging. The graphics were definitely a step up from both Final Fantasies VII and VIII. There isn't much I can say about this game that's bad. Moogles are annoying, but they always have been... Anyways, this is one of the greats."
3,good game but system problem,I enjoyed this game. I played it for five hours but I could not get it to save on my PS2. I needed to get a memory card the game would recognize - the 1 MB PS1 card.
1,worst final fantasy ever,"Okay where do I begin? Well first off the graphics: now I will admit the backrounds are great but the characters look like they all had birth defects imagine the character models of ff7 in exploration mode but shiny and slick.The plot: the plot is terrrible, theres no twists theres no turns its so linnear and predicatable you can tell what's going to happen before it actually happens , and the worst part is you don't care about the characters like you did in ff72(the best game ever made).THE GAMEPLAY: this is the worst part in the game, you have to run around getting weapons and putting spheres inside them just to learn spells and the battle system is completely see through.gameplay 1/10 shallow terriblecharacters 0 /10worst characters ever (the main guys a monkey!) plot 1/10 linear terribleif your going to buy a final fantasy first buy 7, then 10,and finally 8"
1,Worst Final Fantasy Ever,"If you've played hours and hours on the other four(five if you count FFIV) Final Fantasy Games, you should probably hate this one with a passion. Not only do they have characters that lack in imagination or creativity, but also in the depth that other Final Fantasies have brought to the table. The monkey man is indomitable, and the wizard role which was made out to be the best thing since the spork was invented was clearly overrated. Personally the confidence and depth of characterism that were displayed in FF7 and FF9 were excellent and made for a game that I will continue to play over and over until I'm old and grey. FF9 was one that will leave with only one feeling for the future: what is FF10 going to be like?"
1,i'd rather eat crap then play this game,"THese are the ugliest characters i ever saw. especially teh main character so skinny. Such a disgrace to the FFs. taht goes with FFX, and FFVII such disgusting filth."
2,square's going downhill.,"i loved final fantasies vii and viii, but ix really let me down. it's not nearly so deep as its predecessors; the characters don't develop and some of them don't even have a history! the side quests are disappointing and the system is also not quite up to par. if squaresoft had spent more time on this game and less on their beloved movie, it might have gained a star or two, in my opinion."
2,Kid,"Okay, this is one of the saddiest final fantasy game I've ever played.Battle system: ok but not goodCharacters: kinda ugly and predicableGame play: pointless, boring, etc.Graphics: great as always, but the scenery graphics [are not good]...IMPORTANT: If you're looking for a GOOD game, then get Final fantasy 7,8 and MAYBE 10."
2,IS THIS FOR REAL?,"This game has got to be the worst final fantasy ever. There is no way this game could be an dubbed as a final fantasy, i mean seriously come on. This game was one of the easiest games i have ever played and i think it was a simple challenge. i didn't even 9 hours straight i passed way more quickly than any other final fantasy. if you want to check it out that's up to you, but take my advice, it's not worth it."
2,I expected something much better,This game is just boring and it didn't keep my intrest at all. The characters are kind of bland. The battle sequences are confusing and boring at the same time. I just didn't like it. I know that nobody here is going to agree with me the slightest bit.
2,Wow....,"I am Final Fantasy VIII lover. I know alot of people didn't like that one but I love the complexity. The card game, the junctioning system, the turtapod trick... Everything about that game was set up to draw obsessive people like me in.This game, on the other hand, was simple and boring. There was nothing for me to strive towards. I played about 20% of the game before I started getting bored. Played about another 25% of the game before I was so bored I could not keep playing and just gave it up. Never looked back.If I played this one right after FFIII or something then I probably would have loved it. But after VIII this was horrible. And this is coming from someone who still loves the first few FF so it's not just about the level of technology or evolution. This game is just boring and uninspired."
3,SNES Final Fantasy With PlayStation Grapics. :(,"Remember all the great inovations made to the Final Fantasy series when it debuted on the PlayStation with FF7? Well, I was deeply disappointed that FF9 couldn't live up to that new tradition set by 7 & 8. The story line is to long and overdrawn and no where near as interesting. The characters remind me of a Saturday morning cartoon. And the most disappointing thig is the fact that limit breaks have been replaced with a less than impressive ""Trance"" state. The mini games are a feat in themselves. Not because there hard to play but because there so repeatative and boring. When Final Fantasy makes it's PS2 debute next year I for one hope that SquareSoft gets over this case of FF nastalgia, and decides to move the series forward once again or they can just make up with Nintendo and put the series on their new GameCube."
3,didn't finish,I didn't finish it. Probably won't. I went on a FF binge and I couldn't make it through this one. I think COD 4 came out when I quit lol.
3,The worst FF game ive ever played,"You see Final Fantasy was based on an engrossing story, FF VII and FF VIII were both rich with an unique style of gameplay and very fun battles. Yet as stoked as i was to play this game, I was brought down to a level of degression. Starting off the characters are cartoony and feminine with a gameplay that took me only 10 hours to complete, now i know what your thinking, but it took me 50 hours to beat FF 7 and 8. So all in all this game has the graphics, the sound and even the gameplay but no story, not enough characters (cant choose), and no longevity, sorry but I suggest renting this title first before you pay ... unless your a FF finatic."
3,Good but not as much as FF8,"Another Final Fantasy and yet again a new battle system, set of characters, abilities, etc.; to learn. The game is itself pretty good; there is a good amount of FMV (compared to Parasite Eve 2 that almost does not have any) and they are even better than before.It's yet another Square games that takes all my nights until I've explored everything with the game. Unfortunately, the story line, thought good, is not close to be as good as it was in FF8. In my memory, you could almost feel to be in the game with FF8 while FF9 is just a ""good story"".The other thing is that I find this ability system a little bit more awkward than it previously was. One thing to notice is the SUMMONING capabilities which only 2 characters can have and you can't use it much before the end of CD2 (unless you wish to train the princess a lot in the first CD and use her eidolons).Beyond that, it's still a great game."
4,Last great Final Fantasy,"For those that are looking to rekindle that feeling you get from old school playstation 1 rpg's, you need to add this one to your collection. This game was always looked over due to the commercial success of final fantasy 7 & 8, but I say please give this game a try."
5,PS FFIX Game,"I loved this game when I first played it when it was a new release. When my son started liking FF games, I had to purchase all the Final Fantasy games that I had played so he can play them, he really enjoys playing this game."
4,great game,this game has great graphics not a super super long game but still a long game here's what i give it diffculty 4/10 if u know a lot of tactics just like a game called lunar2 eternal blue all u need is tactics to beat bosses story 7/10 some parts u could not understand what was going on replay vaule 2/10 this game most people when they beat the game they will not one to make a new game and beat it again well that's all
5,Best Final Fantasy game I've ever played!,"This game makes it into my top favorite games. When I say 5-stars I mean 50!I was sucked in to the game in the first hour, I couldn't put my controller down. For the PS these are really good graphics, even if you have a PS2 this is a must have! I heard Final Fantasy XI is gonna have Tetra Master in it, so get this game to get some practice if you're thinking about getting FFXI. Anyway, the gameplay rocks, music ROCKS, story REALLY ROCKS, this'll suck up hours of your life if you're not careful, get this game or miss out."
5,This is a really great game!,"This game is totally awesome! It is interesting and addicting. The characters are totally awesome, just like in all the other Final Fantasy games. This game is a really cool game that I totally reccomend to anyone!"
4,Pretty straightforward game from PS2.,"Unlike the last 2 games from FF, this one's a little more based on the old gameplay of Final Fantasy. The story's pretty straightforward, the graphics are great, and there's no weird anime stuff like in 7 and 8. Plus, the fighting's back to normal. What the hell was with the fighting in 8? Anyway, my favorite character would have to be Steiner. He's a jerk, but he's good at fighting. Probably the strongest member. Also, Vivi kicks [rear]. Especially near the end. Solid game."
2,Mediocre Rpg's At there worst,"This game just reeks of sell out i can't even beleive they can legally charge you to own this game. The characters are stupid repeated ideas of previous games mixed with new stuff to make ultra bad characters with a horrible plot and BAD NAMES oh yes BAD NAMES the NAMES MAKE ME SICK WHEN I HEAR THEM. The protagonist is a perverted howler monkey wiht out a life and he makes me sick. Where has squares integrity gone that they must drag such a good name through the mud. I hope those of you who bought this never played the great final fantasies such as (in japanese numbers) 1,2,6,7 and even tactics yes tactics was great. But this shame s the final fantasy name yet one more time... neil,16"
1,Same old same old,"*yawn* Isn't anyone sick of this series yet? I mean come on, what is a role playing game if the story is already laid out for you? Don't get me wrong, I was a die-hard Final Fantasy Player and I have conquered every episode up to FF8. I tried very hard to complete 8 but it kept dragging on and on and I had said enough is enough and turned it off. The same goes for this game too. I suggest to anyone who wants to play a real RPG go get a copy of Everquest and install it on your pc. You won't regret it. It will probably take you 60 hours just to get your character to level 20 let alone the max of level 60. And will take you months upon months to explore the entire map. I dare all of you Final Fantasy players to say enough is enough, I will not read your stupid stories anymore and boar my brains out.Get Everquest **trust me**"
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!,I have been a FF fan for years and have played and beaten them all(even though 8 and 9 majorly ...(stunk)). This i thought was an insult to the best games of the series( 2 and 3 which are the best hands down). The storyline in it was very dumb and the charecters were all ...(gay). also they tried to hard to be like 2 and really screwed up. the graphics may be good but graphis dont compare to a good storyline. SO TAKE MY WORD DONT BUY THIS GAME or youll be blowin your money on this game like i did
1,"oh my god, what a let-down","if you like ff 8,10,11,or 12 then DON'T buy this game!!! this game is so different from the other series and you can't stay as one character for most of the game!! also the biggest disappointment is the way they make the game so it would not be fun for teens, but only for really small kids. it's so dumb, god i can't say enough how i got suckered into buying this.the other reviewers must be on drugs. i wish i could make this note be seen everytime someone browse this game."
2,Game is great as you already know...,"Game is great as you already know, but the copy that was sold to me from Amazon directly was not new like stated in sale. After removing the seal and opening the case I noticed that Disc 1 was all scratched up, to the point that it looked like it was used. Everything else appeared new. Not very happy."
1,READ READ IF YOU WANT TO REALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS GAME READ,"IF YOU WANT A GOOD GAME GET FINAL FANTASY 7 . IN FINAL FANTASY 7 YOU FIGHT, CRY, LAFE, SOMETIMES GET MAD BUT OVERALL FF7 IS A WAY BETTER GAME FOR A MUCH BETTER PRICE. FF7 IS RATED 5 STARS THIS GAME IS 4 1/2. FF7 IS THE BEST GET IF YOU LIKE RPG'S FF7 IS THE BEST. GET FF7 TRUST ME YOU'LL LIKE IT PLEASE GET FF7 IT IS WAY BETTER. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET FF7 THEN GET XENOGEARS WITCH IS MY SECOND FAV GET FF7 OR GET XENOGEAR OR GET FF8 DON'T GET FF9 GET FF7 TRUST ME I'VE PLAYED A LOT OF RPG'S AND FF7 IS THE BEST YOU CAN FIND. I'VE SAID FF7 IS THE BEST SINCE 1997 I WENT THROW THE XENOGEAR YEAR WITCH WAS 1998 THEN I WENT THROW THE FF8 YEAR 2000 AND I STILL SAID FF7 IS THE BEST KNOW I'M GOING THROW THIS YEAR AND I STILL LIKE FF7 THE BEST FF7"
4,All great but some problems,"This game is pretty great good. Like the gameplay,graphics and battle system is good but the game is to easy!!!! I mean I got the game brought home and beat it that day. I just went through the game in a second. I love the series but and this one but it isn't as good as the rest."
4,... those random battles,"This game is great besides those borrrinnggg ...frussttrattinngg random battles ...like always!! Square needs to get a clue and develope a fun battle system for final fantasys.Xenogears had the best battle system but Square STILL decides to go with that ... system they use for final fantasys.Besides that, this game is sweet and is worth buying ......and by the way, XENOGEARS RULES!!"
5,the ninth one,"The game is great if you like it you will love the following titles.Chrono Cross,SAga frointeir 1 and 2, and all the final fantasys!"
5,best Final Fantasy ever,i bought this game at a mall 3 1/2 weeks before its release date and i knew since then i didnt waste my money buying it!! i think its perfect because it has a sense of humor and it kinda has a medievel look which i am pleased to see because the last FF i know of that has a medievel look is Final Fantasy 2 which was released about late 80's!! also none of the charachters are like real reality based like Final Fantasy 8(fictional looking charachters) like the main charachter is a normal boy but what seperates him from the rest is he has a tail and one of the other charachters is a black mage and the game also has 2 white mages!! so i highly recommend this game for anybody who likes RPG's!!
4,it is back for PSP and PS3,"I have the original version (PSX), but I halted on CD3 because the official guide sucks!!! (now I even can't retrieve codes from Square Enix or [...]!).Recently I checked PS Online and found this game and now it's for PSP! It is fun to carry it everywhere to fill up an hour of train ride.The only down side is: it's too addictive. You don't realize you spent a few hours a day just for playing the game!If you want a strategy guide, search it on internet for text-only version. Stay away from official guide!"
4,Final Fantasy IX,"This game is one of the many additions to the popular RPG series, Final Fantasy. Like the others IX is not a continuation of VIII but rather a whole epic story in itself. This is a feature by feature review.Graphics: 5/5The graphics in this game are pretty good for a 32-bit system. The most amazing thing is the FMV sequences which have superb realism.Controls: 5/5The controls are easy to master and simple to use.Sound: 3.5/5The sound is good most of the time but sometimes you start hearing funeral music.Gameplay: 5/5The gameplay of this game is much like the other Final Fantasy series. And the battle system is also like the others.Story: 5/5The story in this game is very long and complex and considering that is spans 4 discs make it a very long one also.Overall: 4.7/5This is a really great game and if you are a beginner or an old pro at RPGs you should pick this one up."
5,Beauty with Fun,"Final Fantasy IX was without a doubt, one of the best games I ever played...right down to tears at the end. Not so hard you became fustrated during play time..Just great fun andunbelievable graphics and sound."
5,A dude who was hooked on this game.,"This game is the best. It's the first of the Final Fantasy games I played. I was hooked on it when I first played it on my cousins Playstation. To me I like to fight with Zidani and Vivi. Vivi is really a strong black mage. Garnet and Schiener are okay to but I like Zidani and Vivi better. Trust buy this game right away, you won't be disappionted!"
4,2nd Greatest FF Game Ever,"Personally, i absolutely loved this game. it definately makes up for the horrible ""love-story"" POS that was FF8. But anyway, the characters and the story are absolutely original and wonderfully put together. The plot is great and theres even a little mini-game where you collect and ""battle"" cards. though they dont really battle, its more of a strategic card-placing game where the object is to obtain more squares of your color on the boardthan your opponent. pretty simple, and actually entertaining. This game requires many hours of gameplay, which is great, and is a must-have for any FF fan or just someone who loves RPGs"
5,Dude Great Game,"to be honest, this game was very good. Just like 7, the cahracter traits 7 is still the ebst but killed 8. I recommend if u like games with hott stories, cinematic scenes, great battles and magic. This game diserves a 5 star quality."
4,Excellent but not as good as 7or 10,First of all they have to fix something i cant write numbers with the ones that say end and page down/up. Anyway this game is awesome. It doesn't live up to 7 or 11. However it was better than eight even though 8 was the worst ****in RPG i had ever played. The graphics are ok the story makes you crack up laughing sometimes. I just hate the new summoning system. i like materia (7) and the sphere grid (10) better. This is a game that some gamers will get sick of and others play over and over again. It really depends if your a hardcore RPG fan like myself. if so you will enjoy this game. at least rent it.
5,LOVE IT!,"Second best Final Fantasy game i have ever played besides FF7! It was brand new and still sealed in its case, but the case was cracked somehow when i got it. But, the case is not important, the game is! It worked perfectly fine."
2,Disappointed,"The projects covered are (from my perspective) very interesting. I like modern, minimilistic elevations.As someone who is considering building a 'mini' house project I have been inspired.However, it was extremely disappointing to have so few photographs of relevence or to have those photographs plastered over the floor plan. Perhaps the editor is concerned we readers might infringe copyright? I don't think so..."
1,disappointed,"disappointed with my order, received 3.4 ounce instead of the 6.8 ounce described. boxes were crushed, not good for a gift."
4,S.T.Coleridge (NOT T.S.Eliot),"Excellent selection of poetry and poetry-related essays by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. NOTE: previous reviewer seems to have confused Coleridge with Eliot. Coleridge DID NOT WRITE The Waste Land, The Hollow Men, or Ash Wednesday -- THAT is why those are not in this book. He DIED in 1834!!"
4,You can't compare it to the original...,"Just listen to the samples and basically, what you hear is what you get.I really like it, which is why I give it 4 stars. It's nicely played, obviously talented performers, and it has the melody of the songs.The only thing that I don't like about it (aside from it being $13 for just a couple of songs) is that they lacked the energy that Nirvana had when they played.So overall, it's a great album, but c'mon, it's Nirvana. It could've been done so much better with a lot more songs than just this list. They don't even have ""Dumb""."
2,"Nice idea, but...","... converting the songs of Nirvana to 'easy listening' classic music simply loses the core of rock. However, I think even without the lyrics more of the beauty of Nirvana's songs could be captured in classical music: Let's wait until Apocalyptica covers Nirvana. That would be worth buying :-)"
2,Underwhelming!,"I bought this CD on a whim, and I was not that impressed with it. I think it's slightly better than an elevator-muzak version of Nirvana's songs. I think Nirvana's music could be done well in a classical style, I just don't think this CD does that. A good example of this is Christopher O'Reilly's album, ""True Love Waits"", which takes Radiohead songs and turns them into classical songs. While it could be argued that Radiohead's music lends itself better to classical music, I think that album picks up more on the complex structure of Radiohead's music...this is a quality Nirvana's music also has, but this music doesn't even come close to capturing that."
3,"It is alright, I expected better","I usually don't write reviews but I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this album. I love Nirvana so that is a major saving grace for this album, however I feel that a lot more could have been done with the compositions to make sure their transition to classical strings sounded pleasing. I just get the feeling that some of the tracks are low recording quality (On a Plain), not well played, or just off in some way. Some of the tracks come off very nicely (Come As You Are), others just sound a little off, as if one of the instruments if off key."
1,Take a pass,"This book can be summed up in one word: weak. If you've ever been out to lunch or at a party with someone who wouldn't stop talking about themselves and condescendingly giving you their opinion on every single topic that comes up, then you've already, in essence, read this book. I think the fact that, as of this writing, there are exactly 7,572 other books ranked higher than this one despite her media friends constantly hyping her book tells you all you need to know about how interesting this book is. I'm upset that I spent $$ dollars on it. There's nothing new here you haven't heard her say on Imus or Hardball of any one of a number of places she seems to always be. Believe me, I love politics, but this was a BIG disappointment."
1,"Dreadful, dumb, yet interesting!","How this woman ever got to be a reporter is beyond my understanding. I take it that she is good at being able to spot things that interest the casual reader of Time magazine. Her analysis of the Bush Gore election is that Bush should win because he served better food than Gore. In the end, this book is dreadful yet interesting because it speaks volumes about what passes for thoughtful `political commentary' theses days."
1,Embarrassing,"Reading this book you feel embarrassed for Margaret Carlson. She brags about being a member of the Sally Queen Special Class in Washington. She shows contempt for ordinary people and their concerns. She hated Al Gore because he talked about issues on the campaign plane, issues that effect the lives of millions. She liked Bush because he served lobster ravioli on the campaign plane and made funny faces instead of boring her with discussion of issues. She recycles her columns from Time magazine. No original insights in her columns. Just conventional wisdom. No wonder Time magazine cancelled her column."
1,Another CINO: Catholic in Name Only,What I found fascinating was how the author praised her upbringing while diametrically opposing the rules under which she was reared. Here is a person who says even today that theChurch is a big part of her life and yet she's pro-choice whileabortion is considered murder by her Church and she speaksproudly about her daughter's work for Planned Parenthood. She apparently had a strong family and yet doesn't talk much aboutbeing part of a two parent family herself. The political articles are not particular cogent. Socially she may be quite the butterfly but politically she's imbedded in the irrationalliberal chasm of today's media mainstream.
2,"great intro book, useful for managers","managers are often reticent to go beyond common sense in product design, oftentimes a book like this one can show them the power of smarter decisions when it comes to ergonomic considerations (beyond common sense).Also, the book enables industrial designers to begin acquire the right tools to communicate design-ergonomic decisions to the remainder of the design-management team."
2,"a must reading for executives, to understand ergonomics","A very refreshing book on ergonomics applied successfully and from the point of view of this science as a business advantage. No hard core tables of values and anthropometric values, plenty of business cases."
1,JUNK,"To begin with this cage is falsely misrepresented as being 24x22x63 when it is actually 22x22x63. If you are not mechanicaly inclined the instructions will mean nothing to you as they are jibberish. If you complain to the company they tell you to send it back at your expense and they will refund your money, or they offer you a 25% discount to not write a bad review on them. Needless to say I declined their 25%!!!!! I have had my African Grey in an Avian cage for twenty plus years and thought it would be nice to treat him to a new cage, BIG MISTAKE!!! I have since had the Avian cage sandblasted and powercoated and gave this piece of junk away."
1,Nice cage But,"The cage that I Ordered was not sent instead I received another cage with NO!! Instructions on assembly It took over 4 hours to assemble, The people that gave this a 5-4 star rating must have either worked for or paid by the company I would never recommend this cage or this company to anyone, I feel cheated, robed and lied to, I will be sending a letter to BBB and State Attorney for misrepresentation on the Ad. The picture of the cage shows the 2 food bowls on same side the one, Size Shows 24x22x63 I received had on either side of the cage the size received was 22x22x63, The T handle that goes on the bottom grate screw was not long enough to go through the grate to the handle The Federal law states that itams sold must be same as picture or that is called misrepresentation."
5,You won't want to miss A LINE!!!,"From the moment I first saw this film, I was drawn in to it. The entire film is hilarious and each and every time I see it ( and I have seen it over and over)I find yet another bit of hilariously hidden gems, whether it's the scenary, the great looks of the characters or the witty lines, you can easily miss, while in the middle of laughing at something else.Once, when I watched this film with my best friend, we rewound the same scene over and over again, laughing harder and harder each time!!!Take a chance and you will be so glad you did!!! BUT POP YOUR POPCORN AHEAD OF TIME YOU WON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE TV!"
4,wicked funny and black humor,"high camp and outrageous humoursmart throwaway lines and some cranking tunesno one can expect too much here, but i laughed alotsure, its stupid - but unlike most movies, it didn't try to be other than thatenjoy it with other folks who have a lghter sense of humor..."
2,YOUR MOMMA BUYS BEER ON SUNDAY,"The film takes place in Southern Illinois, but everyone has a southern accent. Mike Bronco, at times is the voice of reason in this film, but he gets talked into doing stupid stuff. The characters are poor caricatures and the dialouge is poorly cliche and predictable. And when it is not predictable, it is bad. My expectations where low, and unfortunately this film exceeded them. Perhaps in 2001 when this film came out it was worth seeing, but in 2012, the indie comedy has been perfected enough to push this film to the bottom of the must view heap. So watch ""Chumscrubber"" instead and you'll thank me. More stupid than funny.F-bomb, sex, no nudity."
3,"Pretty funny, for what it was.","I really didn't expect much from this movie, but they had it all; the old man/young wife, the mothers country bumpkin boyfriend, topped off with some homemade fireworks.I'm related to some of the folks that should have been in this movie!"
2,How long can you tread water.....or endure this POS?,"I made it exactly 30 minutes, then bailed.I thought Jaime Pressly('My Name Is Earl'), Jason London('Mallrats'), what the heck, why not? Pressly is on the cover of the DVD, but is actually the next-to-the-last person billed, & London is 3 spots above her.What a waste. I hope my library didn't pay for this.'Joe Dirt' was much better than this POS, but at least it's better than The Biography Channel's bio of Sarah Palin(if you're into White Trash)"

3,Regional Humour about a Unique Region,"If you know anything about Southern Illinois, you know it is a region like no other. It is the South without culture or grace, and the Midwest without up-tight-ness. I wish I could say how much of _Poor White Trash_ would have made me laugh if I had _not_ been from Southern Illinois, but being ""from there"" I did laugh a lot. Sean Young earns my love for treating the accent with care.The movie loses its tight observation two-thirds of the way through, when it becomes ""plotty."" Know this going in.Watch this movie with a six-pack and a good buddy!"
2,As the Title Promises,"This film details the tribulations of a lower class white family from Southern Illinois. While the story may have a mild ""camp"" appeal, it seems forced and without any of the real virtue of camp films such ""Flesh Gordon,"" ""Barbarella,"" or ""Uptown Saturday Night."" It does not even measure up to the best of campTV like Showtime's ""Sherman Oaks"" because of poor acting, even in roles that present very little challenge, from everyone in the film except William Devane and the widely advertised but not-so-prominently featured Jamie Pressly. This film does have a few solid one-liners that will put a smile on your face and watching it will not feel like a complete waste of time, which puts it in at least the 50% of films, but do not place it too high on your list. ..."
3,Shoe story,A little more uncomfortable than my last several pair of Dexters. and 9 more words to meet the requirements of someone???
2,Great live playing destroyed by AWFUL sound quality,"This is a 2-CD condensation of the 4-CD live retrospective ""10 Anni Live -- 1971-1981"". While the playing is strong, the recording sounds like a mediocre-quality bootleg. Recordings sometimes start or end in mid-song. Instruments (especially Mauro Pagani's violin) get lost in the mix. For some reason, there are 2-1/2 renditions of ""Four Holes in the Ground."" The most interesting material is the earliest (which, oddly, also has the best sonic quality), with covers of King Crimson's ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" and Jethro Tull's ""My God."" Fans of PFM's live improvs will find several long jams here."
5,Calico Chronicle: Texas Women and Their Fashions 1830-1910,"The pictures are beautiful, the information is extensive, and it'll make you want to sew!"
5,Expanded Capra Press Edition is best choice,"This novel is of course a classic on bullfighting, but the prospective book buyer should be aware that the newer 1988 Capra Press hardcover edition includes an additional 34 page afterward by the author, written in 1987, that is comprised of the the author's true, first hand account of Manolete, the bullfighter considered by many to be Spain's greatest hero. This addition to the classic book makes the newer edition preferable to older editions."
5,AFE Power Cold Air Intake System Stage 2 Ford Super Duty Trucks 99-03 V8-7.3L Turbo Diesel Power Stroke 54-10192,"I recently installed the AFE Power Cold Air Intake System Stage 2 for Ford Super Duty Trucks 99-03 V8-7.3L Turbo Diesel Power Stroke(AFE Part number 54-10192). I found that Amazon.com beat the closest competitor by $70 and AFE by $110, and, they had the part on my door step in 4 days - free!The part was easy to install and took less than an hour start to finish.The increased power was very, very noticable! I highly recommend this product - it's well worth the money!!!"
4,Terrific,"As usual a great book, love the action romance and great banter as always a terrific book can alway count on these to be good"
1,I blame Amazon for this one,I think its completely irresponsible of Amazon not to indicate somewhere that this is some MINI book. I paid more than the $2.99 listed on the front of the book. This is the first and LAST time I order books from Amazon. I don't have time to read every review to find out the size of a book. That should be apparent in the description somewhere.
1,BEAWARE,"Beware: Amazon is charging you $4.98 for a small book that is marked as $2.98. The price should be for the 2 pack of books with(Midnight In Death)and should be labeled as ""MASS MARKET TEASERS"". The whole plot is developed, but in only 80+ pages. Wanted to send them back, but would cost me to mail them. Just ate the cost and will be very careful in the future."
4,"An oldie, but a goodie","Don't be deluded by the publishing date. This is NOT a new story. If you're an IN DEATH fan, this does not pick up where the most recent book left off. This was originally published as a short story in a book of short stories named OUT OF THIS WORLD in August of 2001. But, if you're a fan it won't matter. Nothing earth shaking happens in it, so this story could be ""anytime"" in the later half of the series."
2,Should have read the details. . . .,"The reviews posted on the site are longer than the book. It is less than 100 pages long and about 1/4"" thick. I know it is a ""value"" book but it's a tiny, quick read that would be more suitable to a Good Housekeeping magazine (granted not PG rated!) than a book."
5,Always a Great Read,"I am biased, but for all of those J.D. Robb fans, Interlude in Death was just as great a mystery-romance as all the others. I just cannot get enough of Eve, Roarke, Peabody, Mavis, and the rest of the regulars!"
5,short but sweet,"I enjoyed this, but did not realize that it was a novelette and was expecting a full-size book. Still was excellent reading as only Ms. Roberts could write!"
4,"Good, but short",I really love J D Robb and this series but this one was way to short. Still a very good read.
5,Wonderful,I have to say that this another book by J.D. Robb that is just wonderful. I really like the way she writes these books in the future and makes them just awesome. All of her J.D. Robb books that I have read have been great.
1,A Mini Book for more than a Mini Price,"How disappointed I was to find such a small book for a price almost as much as a regular sized one. With the ""special offer"" price on the cover I was especially upset to realize just how much I paid for this product which took only an hour to read."
3,Interlude In Death,"This book was just okay, where as some of the JD Robb books hold my attention a little better and are harder to figure out who done it."
5,Great read,I've read this book in paperback before and I love all of her books. I am a huge fan and so is my sister in Barbados who I introduced this author to. Looking forward to many great deals on these books for my kindle because I loved the price.
4,Interlude in Death,Great book loved as most all of her books. I mostly can't put them down once i start reading them
2,Disappointing Eve Dallas short story,"I wish I had known this was a previously published short story rather than the full length novel I was expecting. Instead I received an 88 page paperback that, once read, was pretty obviously a filler written quickly and without the care of the other Dallas books."
3,disappointed,"I have been a jd robb fan for many years and was very excited to get two new novels in the mail only to discover that interlude and midnight in death are both only 90 page novels (or stories). i was expecting full size novels, although they were decent that is not nearly enough pages to get a decent plot. i think that in the future the number of pages of a book should be listed so that there arent many disappointed fans in the future."
2,A Marketing Teaser,"I bought ""Interlude"" a month ago with its 80 some pages and its pricing scheme of $2.99 plus $1.99 sourcing fee (I think I would have gone through the roof if I had only bought Interlude and had to pay the $4 plus shipping fee) is a rip off when you are led to believe this is a novel, and then only to find out its nothing more that short story and a poor story at best. I see there are number of reviewers that have been disappointed and feel the same way I do.I have enjoyed many of Nora's books and I don't like throwing a wet blanket on her writing skill, but still I don't understand why she would release these types of marketing teasers. I do know that I won't be buying them and I'll be giving my real close attention to future releases by the author."
2,Strangers in Death,"I have enjoyed J.D. Robb books for years. However, over the past several books the Death Series is becoming predictable. Eve becomes irrated with everything, Roarke forgives her everything and on and on. Strangers in Death is no exception to the predictability. Shake the series up a bit and write something totally unexpected."
3,J.D. Robb,"Although all the J.D. Robb stories are enjoyable, I felt this one was too short and more like a magazine story. It was a ripoff to loyal J.D. Robb fans."
5,A very nice interlude,"This is a in death novella.... I really recommend reading these in order, since you get to see character growth, clearly in Eve and her affection for Roarke. One interesting dynamic here is the marriage of 2 Alpha personalities.... As I continue in this series, I'm interested in how Robb will let it play out. Peabody's dry humor is also very entertaining."
2,Nice Detail,"That's about all this had going for me. No Sound. The imagery has very nice detail but it moves very slowly. Who wants to spend 10 minutes watching shadows creep across a room at a snails pace? If thats art, well then ok. I was bored and had to fast forward through every scene on the disc."
4,uh!,i first heard about this band when i got the sampler that came with Korns 'follow the leader'. i think the track was corncob pipe. but i could never find the damn cd. then i found it on amazon for a penny. so of course i picked it up. but jesus does this cd sound like it came out in 98. overall its a good rap rock cd but goddamn is it dated. track listing:1.corncob pipe2.beats dont stop3.things gotta change4.peppyrock (best song on the album)5.superchile6.road trip7.rigamorale8.cog9.boilermaker10.bad trip11.btkpick it up. its worth a spin or two. definately has a late 90s cali sound.
4,Excellent comic if a little sappy,"This is a collection of Rose Is Rose comic strips, one of the few decent ones not to appear in the Washington Post (along with Foxtrot and maybe Funky Winkerbean). They're a bit sappy at times: son Pasquale has a helpful guardian angel and is too good to be believed. On the other hand, the artwork is excellent and some of the ideas superb. Rose, the mother, has recurring fantasies of being a biker babe, which are brought out at odd moments. Dad is a great tease, at one point getting onto his knees with his shoes under them and telling Pasquale that he got that way because he didn't eat his vegetables. Certainly very entertaining."
5,Sweet but not icky.,"I read this book without strong expectations and immediately found myself enthralled. The jokes were funny, the drawings excellent, the way the panels were laid out and designed often intriguing. It's something as rare as a non-cynical and yet non-icky comic strip about a family that enjoy each other's company. Highly recommended to any one who enjoys comics of the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" or ""Peanuts"" sort. And anyone else for that matter. This strip could make a comics-convert out of most"
4,A Wee Bit Out-dated,"Basically, this is a good book. The one I got was from 1987 ... and there's much more recent research and info available. Wished I had paid more attention to the edition date when I got it."
4,Folding table,"I purchased this unit for my adult grand daughter. She is disabled and it is easy for her to access. First of all it was hard to put together. Secondly the wing that supports the drop leaf broke the first time it was used. It could have had an extra coat of varnish, but I can do that next time I visit. Otherwise it is a great little thing for a person that has limited flat surface space in a NY apt. Thank you."
5,Great Product,"Great product and great service from the seller 'Ebargainhunters' when I bought mine. Received in just a few days. Compressor works great, especially for adding just a couple of lbs of air to a tire. A little bit slow if inflating more than 4 or 5 pounds of air, but not an excessive length of time. Highly recommend this product and would certainly use the seller Ebargainhunters again."
5,Great product,"Coleman 12-Volt 5-In-1 Compressor W/Light #PMC7060Remember the old bicycle pump? The one that will exhaust you in just a few minutes of pumping? As a female, I had no way to pump up tires; whether vehicle, lawn mower, or wheelbarrow. (other than the old pump) I received this pump and it is absolutely great. No more pumping till exhausted. Just plug in to the cigarette lighter of vehicle and pump till at correct pressure. I am so pleased!"
3,GRANTSTAND,THIS CD is not bad but it seem to have that same flavor of each song on this cd. but I love grant and i would still get this cd because of that. and it's sad that people are now just knowing who he was and the funk he put out in the late 60's and early 70's.
4,Fast Shipping Works Well,This makes cutting drywall easy. The only problem is the blades wear out quickly. Worth the price
1,"Good Idea, Stale Info","The author's idea (Make a living by delivering RVs and specialty vehicles) is great, but free (he describes it on his website). The value of the book would be the contact info for 4000 manufacturers, dealers and transport services.But this info was stale when the last printing was made, in 2002. At that time, most of the phone numbers in my geography (WA) had already changed area codes 3 years before. Therefore, the book has phone numbers that were already out of date.Advice to potential buyers: Read his website, use yellow pages to find potential customers, skip the book. (And don't hold your breath, I've made 45 contacts with one possible employment opportunity)."
4,Marvelous,This book has the inside track on this carrier opportunity. I am in the field as a transporter and i have heard horror stories that could have been avoided if those people would have had this gem of a book.
2,Sold it at a garage sale,"Basically, it doesn't work. Too good to be true! It's probably very outdated because no body will pay you to travel."
2,"Great design, but average printing quality.","I am a big t-shirt buyer, and this one was quite disappointing.It looks good from a distance or on a small image, but close-up the printed image is of rather sub-standard quality. The black lines are not neat, they drool a little, the outlines of the main female character in particular are pretty crude.I don't know if all copies have this defect or just the series mine comes from, but I would advise any potential buyer to check out a real copy before making this purchase."
1,Complete And Utter Garbage,"Nancy helps Mr. Drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building. The owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck. Ooooooh! That's so scary. Yawwwwwwn. This book is absolutely horrible. The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery. It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals. When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people. Lots of suspense there. This book features Nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants. This is an awful book that doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating."
2,CT - You Can Do Better,"Cheap Trick has been my favorite band for years and I was highly anticipating Special One. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few songs - i.e. My Obsession, Best Friend, Pop Drone - the album is a major disappointment. If you want to hear a recent Cheap Trick release that rocks, check out their previous album, Cheap Trick 97. Special One is a pale imitation of CT97."
3,"Not horrible, not great","Don't let the diehard fans fool you... this is no classic. However, it does not stink either. There are three very good songs--""If I could,"" ""Scent of a Woman,"" and ""She's My Obsession."" The rest is average. But compared to most of what's out there, this is pretty good."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I think any Chep Trick fan will enjoy this - I would rank it ahead of Cheap Trick (1997). Quite a lot of this sounds like classic Cheap Trick ... off-beat, knarly guitars and a healthy dose of power pop. I have listened to it straight through 4 times and it holds up/ gets better each time."
3,"Nothing ""special"" about this ""one""","Cheap Trick can do better and they know it.This album is a mixed bag, from start to finish.The opening track is a clunky Who rip-off.""Words"" is a pedestrian ballad and ""Best Friend"" is filler.""My Obsession"" is easily the best song here, but it is a left over track from one of their previous albums.There are a couple other good songs here, but 3 or 4 good songs does not an album make."
3,Three stars rating ONLY with consideration for fine five cut DVD video clips included,My Obsession is very good andRobin's voice is great on thisLP. Rick and Bun E. are very finetoo but TP's Bass (lackthereof)and poor songwriting come offbringing this down a bit. Whydo they keep allowing Tom toco-write?! Wasn't Woke Up WithA Monster lesson enough?!
3,(Un) Special One only in the sense of the good bonus DVD 'trick' inside,"This is an ordinary **.5 star, Tom Peterson influencedCheap Trick album that seems to have been the kind ofrush job that has hurt this normally vveerrry goodgroup his 'Dagmar-ness' has returned in late '87. No,it's sure not bad (even Woke Up With A Monster, Bustedand even In Colour have their moments...well, make that'moment',with I.C...), but could have been bettersince it TOOK SIX YEARS TO COME OUT SINCETHE fine 1997 effort 'Cheap Trick'.Imagine that the record company pushed 'Scent of a Woman' asthe best of the lot here (Pop Drone, my eye...). If that'sthe best the Tricksters have left in them, god help us CheapTrick fans. And god help this once great band...[It get's 2.5stars if you rate it on the CD alone on a normal *-**** starscale]"
5,The energizer bunnies of rock 'n' roll,"Back in the late 70's my friends and I used to marvel at how fresh sounding Cheap Trick's brand of rock 'n' roll sounded against everything else out at the time. And here it is five years into the next century and they still sound every bit as relevantly irrelevant as they did when they first hit the scene. I own every one of their releases (minus the always disappointing single CD best of collections), the always entertaining DVDs as well. Special One is just that-very special, right on target, melodic, rough around the edges, big sounding in a small way, crunchy guitars, thundering bass, concrete drumming, fantastic vocals. These guys are the most under appreciated, underrated American band of all time. (in England it was Squeeze)"
2,hmmmm,"im actually stunned by the other reviews to be honest.I was so looking forward to getting this album in the post,and excitedly opened it when it finally arrived.the bonus dvd has some great stuff on it,so i was immediately pleased with that.the album,,,,,NOT so much!To be perfectly honest, if i played the whole thing more than 3 or 4 times all the way through,id be very surprised.it sounds to me like a band out of ideas. honestly. and i love CT very much.so this one is filed under""no thanks"" for me,and there is absolutely nothing special about it.( apart from the bonus dvd;-)Thank god they came back with Rockford,and even stronger with The Latestas i was worrying about them!they are stil tremendous live also!!!!!!Keep On Rockin;-)psyes,im about to dig it out and try and see some of what the other reviewers saw,so wish me luck;-)"
3,Scent of a Woman is NOT a Cover...,Just thought that needed to be said...its a Cheap Trick Original...the boys can still bring it when they try.
3,Signs Of Life,"New disc from 70's legends Cheap Trick proves the band can still write a catchy tune. My Obsession, Pop Drone, Too Much, Special One, and Words are the strongest tracks. The classic Cheap Trick power-pop sound is very much alive on Special One with it's Beatle-ish melodies and grungy guitars. But just as they did in their early years, the boys aren't shy about exploring their quirky, experimental side either. Check out the songs Sorry Boy and Hummer to see what I mean. Overall, Special One is probably Cheap Trick's best record since 1985's Standing On The Edge. It's nice to hear them performing their own material after the dreary late-80's / early-90's period when their label forced them to bring in outside writers and it seemed the band had totally sold out in the pursuit of a hit. Whether or not Special One will spawn a radio hit and revive the band's career is anyone's guess. But if nothing else it proves that 25 years later Cheap Trick still rocks with the best of them."
4,Back At Last With A Great Album,"This is a long overdue studio album from one of America's great bands, A solid effort that fits in nicely with their classic catalog. I particularly like the Steve Albini produced ""Sorry Boy"" (wherein the bands brings the heaviosity, ala ""Auf Wiedersehen"") and Blur / Gorillaz fans should definitely check out Dan ""the Automator"" Nakamura's groovin' mix for ""Hummer"".As a really cool bonus, the band includes a DVD full of videos of classic songs spanning their entire career. My personal favorite is ""Say Goodbye"" a fantastic should-have-been-a-massive-hit from the Cheap Trick '97 album."
5,"""Words"" can never say too much about this disc","Cheap Trick graces its fanatical following with another stellar follow up to their great Cheap Trick (97) album. ""Scent of a woman"" is one of the best Cheap Trick singles released in years. ""Too much"", ""Pop Drone"" and ""My Obsession"" update Cheap Trick's classic sound. The first half of the disc is lighter and more pop oriented than the second half. Starting with ""Sorry Boy"" (supposedly about soldiers dying in Iraq according to bassist Tom Petersson) the album takes a dramatic turn and really gets darker. ""My Best Friend"" is a monster of a song. ""If I could"" starts off with a dance rhythm before returning to the Cheap trick we all know and love. ""Low Life in High Heels"" and ""Hummer"" are basically two different songs in one. Overall this disc is terrific for a band whose has been consistently amazing throughout all the rough years."
4,Great Album... seriously!,"OK, first, you need to know that is not an ""instant"" cd. It does't leap of the speakers and posess you immediately. It takes a few listens before it all begins to hook you. Some have said that this CT album doesn't rock. It is definitely more subdued that most of their releases, though it is not ""laid back"" or mellow. The songs are slow and midtempo in the majority but in the same vein that songs like ""Heaven Tonight"" and ""Gonna Raise Hell"" are, not poppy like ""The Flame"". This album has some legs. I too regret that radio, being what it is currently, won't be helping this album find the audience it deserves.Second, this is not just for fans, but for anyone that likes great rock 'n roll.Third, thank god they still put out albums and aren't a nostalgia act!Auf Weidersehen!"
4,Cheap Trick show the young 'uns how to rock,"For nearly 30 years now, Cheap Trick have created the template for power pop-rock bands to go by, spawning the likes of Everclear, Marvelous 3 and more. They continue their legacy with 'Special One,' which shows the band flexing their songwriting muscles and not being afraid to rock.From barnburners like 'Scent of a Woman' and 'Sorry Boy' to the mellow, yet upbeat 'If I Could,' Cheap Trick keep the music energetic, all with a classic sound. Nielsen, Zander, Petersson and Carlos have crafted an album that sounds like 2003 and 1983 at the same time, showing these young upstarts how to make good, fun rock and roll. 'Special One' is bigtime special."
5,I can not believe how good this CD is!,"I'll be honest. I have not been overly impressed with Cheap Trick's studio output since the early eighties. While all their albums have some gems, there always seemed to be a few songs that did not do anything for me. Not ""Special One"": Folks, this is Cheap Trick at its best. Easily their best studio album since the seventies. If you thought Cheap Trick 97 was it, wait until you hear this one. It is a diverse CD ranging from beautiful, dark love songs (Words, Special One) to flat out howling rockers (Sorry Boy, Best Friend) There really is no weak song. For a band 30 years old, I am simply amazed. Lovers of new power-pop (Rooney, Weezer, Fountains of Wayne, etc.) come check out this album and see the fathers of power pop at their collective best."
3,Good Solid CD,I must say that Cheap Trick is going for a hit single on this one. Good CD but inconsistent. Worth picking up.
1,I Would Almost Give It A Zero,"If it wasn't Cheap Trick. Cheap Trick is my favorite band in the world, but the new disc sounds very uninspired imo. The hooks are very lacking & the songs are terrible & boring for the most part. I can't see how anyone could find this as one of their better efforts. I listened to it three times & don't even care if I get it back. ""The Doctor"" is even 10 times better than ""Special One"". The only redeeming songs on this disc are Scent Of A Woman & Words. They need a new producer, not Steve Albini & some help writing some new songs, because it's obvious that the band can't do it themselves anymore."
2,Cheap Trick not what they used to be,"I just purchased their new CD and I would love to tell everyone that it is GREAT...but I can't. I was really excited to get their new CD, I have been a huge fan for years, and have met the band on a few occasions. I wish they would return to their roots and get that great Cheap Trick ""hook"" to their songs. This CD has a few tracks that are worth a listen. But I genuinely feel like I just threw 15 bucks away."
1,I feel worse...,"This supplement may increase alertness, but not in a good way. Now I have an underlying seizure disorder, and maybe that was it? - but one of my most bothersome symptoms is this relentless, unwillful, unrelated-to-anxiety teeth-clenching. Since no medication has helped, I decided to try this supplement. Within a few minutes of taking this supplement my clenching increased and I got really 'blinky' - I started blinking a lot for some reason? My sinuses cleared too? But I felt TENSE, not relaxed, and relaxation was the reason I decided to try this product.Go with the Swanson GABA supplement. Now that one works."
2,"A great idea, careless and unprofessional execution","As a die hard Redskins fan, I was very sorry to see this excellent concept so badly muffed. The idea behind this book is to cash in on the Washington Post vault, providing great photos and articles combined with new pieces by long-time Skins beat reporters to tie it all together. Sadly, whoever edited and proofread this thing reeeally dropped the ball. Sentences at the bottom of the page are repeated at the top of the next, photographs are mislabeled, pieces of sentences are missing, words are chopped off in the middle. Probably still of some value for the die hard Skins fan, but a real black eye for the Washington Post. If their newspaper were produced as shoddily, Richard Nixon would have finished his second term."
4,standing the test of time,"I'd heard an old scratchy vinyl copy of this album about 10 years ago but it was not until now that it's beauty hit home.It would be controversial to say that this disc is better than his recent material, better to state that it is merely different. The simple melodies and no-nonsense instrumentation with hints of Bill's famed guitar make this one of my favorite of albums. This album sits closer to the Orchestra Arcana camp than Chance Encounters. Simple, thoughtful, engaging and surprisingly resistant to the passage of time"
1,Hmmm??,"This album is for hard core Bill Nelson fans only. While composition wise, the musical arrangements are as interesting as ever, the instrumentation (cheesy synthesiser sounds and tinny drum machines - no doubt state of the art in their day)is very early 80's and, I have to disagree completely with another reviewer here, and say that it is very much of it's time and has not aged well at all. For sublime instrumental music of an ambient and meditative nature, check out Nelson's ""Chance Encounters in the Garden of Lights""."
4,"If you like to make brimmed hats, this book is great!","This book will change your attitude about crocheting and what you can do with it. You will learn how to crochet beautiful brimmed hats, baskets, and luggage. Definitely NOT your afghan, granny square vests, and lace shawl kind of crocheting."
4,Oldie but a goodie,"This book predates the tapestry crochet books and is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the techniques required to create crochet objects that hold there shape. The author talks through the processes he went through to formulate the patterns, enabling the reader to take a similar journey. The patterns are excellent and easy to follow. Because of its age the materials list is out of date, but the author goes into the composition of the materials he used. Similar products can be found from this discussion"
3,"THROW PIES AT DAWN! BOO, DAWN!","I don't like Dawn. It is as simple as that. She is a California cliche -- blond, surfer, health food hound. That is all just a stereotype.In this book, she rams her environmental interest (obsession, really)down everybody's throat. It was good that she was able to organize a recycle team at her middle school. It was good that she encouraged others to get involved. What was NOT good was the way she wanted credit for the whole shebang. That pitiful girl was so greedy for credit it was sad. I liked it when Stacey, a fellow sitter complained that Dawn was driving everybody bananas by taking her environmental issues to an extreme. She all but put out a citizen's arrest on folks who weren't vegetarians or who threw away paper, glass, plastic and metal products. I think this girl needs to be recycled. I was glad when she moved back to the West Coast."
4,I am a fan and the kids like it,"I used to watch the batman show when I was a kid. I started showing it to my kids when they we in grade school. They love it. It's been years of watching them with the kids and now they too have fond memories of the show. Nice to see that the kids still enjoy non bloody, non overly violent shows."
5,Woow- what great service!,I ordered this book and got it within 2 days of ordering it. It was great service and the book was in great condition!
4,pleased with prompt service,"the product arrived earlier than anticipated.'packaging was appropriate & the product was as presented on the site.no issues requiring contact with seller, but would like at this point to thank them for their service & will be shopping with them again should the need arise.Kat5668"
3,One thing...,"On your description it said that the cover was bent a little bit but the pages were clean and crisp, however in the first chapter there was a lot of nice bright pink highlighting...next time please acknowledge that because I definitely did not get what I thought I bought. Thanks."
3,Tungsten T5 Case,I wasn't real happy with the way the extra cards fit in the case. The metal strips are facing out and can get scratched or damaged. This is a replacement for another case and this one opens like a book and doesn't fold up very well. Kind of awkward to hold when open. Otherwise well-made. Serves a purpose.
5,A great collection.,"Dear Diary: I have fallen in love with a poet named Frank O'Hara. I started with ""Lunch Poems,"" but needed more. This volume is divine. O'Hara sneaks up on you. His style is so simple, so conversational, that you often times are surprised by the sudden depth of feeling comminicated in a final phrase. I don't know enough about poetry to prattle on and on without betraying my ignornace in short order. However, I know what I like, I know what speaks to me. I know that Frank O'Hara was a great poet."
3,"Security Bits Set, 35 pc. w/ Storage Case","the security bits are well made, but kit does not include handle. uses 1/4 inch size. using a 1/4 inch nut driver and 1/4 inch Neiko open rachet to use security bits."
4,La Dolce Vita 'NAmerica - A Joyful Tribute,"Micheal Castaldo's La Dolce Vita 'NAmerica is pure fun, especially for one who is a fan of Italian music and culture. It is also a touching family tribute. The CD contains a wide range of selections from the popular ""E Tu"" to the Puccini classic ""Nessun Dorma."" Mr. Castaldo's voice has excellent clarity as he sings each piece with great emotion."
5,Somewhere in Europe,"Scripted by noted film scholar Bela Balazs, ""Europe"" is one of the strongest postwar films to emerge from Hungary, and speaks volumes about the dispiriting cruelties of modern society. Even as it celebrates the end of fascism, the film clearly advances a socialistic message, exemplified in the speeches of Old Man Simon. But its raw and indelible portrait of lawless lost boys on the road to redemption elevate ""Europe"" to timeless cinema."
4,nice,these tires arrives partially aired up. Brand new tires make a huge difference on the cart. Only 4 stars because they needed more air. Nice tires and rims.
4,Not Bad for a Little 1 Battery Light,Solid construction and a good little light. Gerber makes good tools period. This light can be operated using one hand.
3,"Good, but Much better options are available","This little light is ""good"", but there are much better lights in the same class out there.It is a solidly built casing, but the light is only slightly above average.The Gerber is way too overpriced for such an average light capability.If you want something super bright and water-tight, look at the Fenix E01 keychain light.Also worth looking at is the Streamlight microstream flashlight.The Streamlight is the best, in class light I have found, to date."
4,Good compact LED,"This is a bright, compact, waterproof, lightweight LED. Good to throw in your toolbox, or backpack and forget about it until you need it. It also comes with a clip that can be used to attach it to the bill of a baseball cap for hands free use.I gave this item 4 stars because the LED bulb is slightly off center, but this does not seem to affect its performance. Also, the full list price is too expensive. Only the heavily discounted Amazon price of under $20.00 makes it a good buy."
2,Nice little light....for under $10,I've had this light for a month or so and it's proven to be a handy gadget. I do not find that it puts off a good amount of light for comparitively smaller lights that I own. I have a $15 led pen light that is much brighter and a bit clearer. I caught this on a bargain price for $10. I wouldn't pay much more that that. Sorry Gerber.
3,Dim but small light,"This is a small and well constructed light that suffers from 2 flaws. It is dim (which hopefully means it will last a while on one battery) and the way to turn it on and off is by twisting the bottom. The on/off mechanism wouldn't be too bad, but I was hoping to use this light one handed and this is difficult to do. It does provide sufficient light for basic tasks without requiring a new battery every day."
2,Long run time - very little light,"Gerber 22-80012 Infinity Ul Task LED Flashlight, BlackSolid Build, Very long run time, Puts out enough light to light up your feet."
2,Not what I expected,"Coming from gerber this flashlight is not what I expected.This item was for personal use, but the if you're looking for the brightest light at the end of the tunnel.Please turn around and look for another source of light.This isn't going to cut it.The only reason I won't be returning the item is because I'm not fortunate enough to have the time to replace or return the item at the moment.I would expect a better product from gerber.Looks like I'll be sticking with maglite.Thanks,Bucky Wilson[...]"
3,Kinda weak,"Yeah, it's OK for simple tasks in the dark, but not good for what I need. At least I'm not buying special batteries for it. We'll see how long it lasts."
2,OK,Had this One for a Bit..Not to bright but it is durable. They really need to make it Brighter..I bought a streamline lite..Bright and durable cant go wrong..
3,Dim,Nice compact size but not the brightest light that I've seen. It fits nicely in my car's console but I'm not too sure how much good it will be when I have to use it.
3,You can do better.,First of all the light is not as bright as I would have hoped it would be only 8 lumens (this is not disclosed in the description).For $16 dollars you can get a streamlight micro stream which is brighter smaller ; it does have a shorter run time but the added brightness is worth it. The light seems to be well built like other gerber products. I just expected more for what I paid in comparison to so many other lights. My $12 Fenix is almost as bright for $5 dollars less.
1,Rugged? Not.,"I had this light on my key chain for a few weeks and it threw out enough light to do routine EMS work by. Then it slipped out of my hand and fell three feet to the pavement and it hasn't worked since. One other 1 star review refers to this vulnerability. There does not appear to be a way to replace the bulb (if that is the problem, it looks the same as pre-drop.) Dropping a flashlight from a low height (or banging it against something with similar force) is completely foreseeable and the description of this as rugged or reliable under working conditions is deceptive."
4,Gerber Infinity Ultra Task LED flashlight,"Lightweight and plenty of light. Kids seem to love it, maybe someday I'll get to use it."
1,False Advertisement,"The Amazon product description says 100 hours run time.I received the item and the package states 32 hours run time.This is false advertisement.This seems to happen a lot with online retailers when they fill their current inventory with new and similar product but keep the old item description. You must follow through on every new product or you get disillusioned customers such as myself. I know it's an honest mistake on Amazon's part, but this is behavior I'd expect from other retailers."
2,Get something else,I have bought a number of compact flashlights in the past year for work. The Gerber is the last on my list for brightness. Check around and get something better.
3,Very solid build but dimmer than I had hoped for,"As prior reviews have pointed out, this is a sleek, solid beautiful little flashlight. I own a StreamLight PT 2L and it just plain spoiled me. I never expected the Gerber Ultra to come close to that, but it's really only going to help me for smaller tasks, and perhaps a glove box application. I'm going to buy a lithium AA and see if it makes a difference. I have a pak-lite 9 volt double LED cap light, that was very inexpensive and is just as bright if not brighter. check them out if you've never seen them.. Still, as a lover of Gerber blades and all well designed lights and tools, this is still a very nice little light."
3,Small and compact,"The picture of this flashlight makes it seem like there's a glass (or plastic) lens to protect the LED. There isn't. The bright circle is from light emitted from the sides of the LED bouncing off the conical-shaped recessed opening. The end of the bright circle is where the tip of the LED stops projecting forward.Being conical (with sloping, but straight sides) the reflector cannot focus the light from the LED. It's also anodized black like the rest of the flashlight body. I have other flashlights from other manufacturers that use a parabolic shaped polished reflector, allowing the beam to be focused into a tight spot.Construction-wise, it's well made. I won't say that it's indestructible, but it's not bad...the exposed LED is clearly the weak spot. The rear battery cover screws on and has two o-rings for environmental sealing."
3,"Good size, okay light","Bought this to keep in my coat, so it suits the job. Small enough that it goes unnoticed, and the light is decent enough to work in a pinch. I just with that it packed a bit more of a punch."
3,decent product,"Not too powerful but powerful enough to be a good task light. I have smaller and brighter task lights but the construction of this unit (very solid) makes me favor this one over others that I have. This is not intended to be a general purpose flashlight, it works best for working in small confined areas."
5,Gerber Infinity LED,"This little light is of very good quality, and I was suprised at the area of coverage of the beam! It does not set the night on fire, but at a normal operating range within several feet, it casts a wide ""moon-light"" circle of very usable and pleasant light for pretty much what you would need it for.In total darkness, the light actually illuminates a whole (household) room! I believe everyone could definately benefit from one (or more) of these!"
2,great flashlight with one huge shortcoming,"I've had my flashlight for about a year. The battery life is very good, which is why I'm trying to change the battery after more than a year of occasional use. Here's the problem; the battery is such a tight fit that it just won't come out. I've emailed Gerber to see what can be done, but this seems like a big design problem that will just end up happening again if the battery isn't changed often."
3,I'm a big fan of Gerber but this item is overpriced in my opinion.,"This light is ok. It is fairly bright for a AA led. It is built solid except that the led (bulb) is kinda exposed. The led is recessed deeply in a cone shape depression but without any protective layer, I'm wondering if my keys will ever poke into the bulb area while in my pocket together and if so will the bulb survive. Also the clip is not very good if used with light on outside of pocket, it falls off in about 10 mins of activity and with light inside pocket the outward bend on the end of clip can scratch ones wrist, catch on clothes etc. It may work better clipped on a belt. My main issue with this item is that it seems to be a bit overpriced for what it is. I got a Drocy 5w reg. size flashlight for about the same price and was totally blown away by it. Still since I already have this I carry it most days and so far it's slghtly better than $5 to $10 off brand models."
2,"Not very bright, old twist-on style switch",not bright at all. i hate the twist-on style switch. Not badly made but performs like a $6 flashlight.
1,Do Not Buy!!,"This little flashlight puts out great light in a small package. The design is rugged. Unfortunately, i dropped this light while pulling it off my work belt, and it no longer worked. Dropped it once and it no longer worked. Works great if you never drop it."
